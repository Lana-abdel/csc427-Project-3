518359	8239592	65470	1.0	Big bore is more like it	This so-dumb-it's-numbing Sasquatch cinema stinker holds the dubious honor of being possibly the first-ever American movie made about the legendary Bigfoot . Alas , it's also one of the worst-ever movies ever made about Bigfoot . A small tribe of Sasquatchs - - one giant bad male , three babbling females , and a homely , noisy " whattheheckisit ? " - type hybrid baby critter - - abduct luscious young human babes for unsavory procreative purposes . Everybody involved with this putrid turkey comes out stinking worse than filthy old socks . Bouncy , buxom blonde bombshell Joi Lansing , clad only in a skimpy pink nightie , runs shrieking through the woods with a grunting , lecherous Bigfoot in hot pursuit . Robert Mitchum's no-talent son Chris , trying to look tough with his scruffy beard and bandanna , makes for a pitifully unconvincing biker hero . John Carradine , sporting a hideously overdone Southern drawl and a juicy hamminess that could be made into a dozen cans of Spam , gives an unbearably unrestrained performance as traveling salesman Jasper B . Hawke , who wants to nab himself a Bigfoot so he can make a bundle exploiting the beast to the ninth degree . Robert Mitchum's no-talent brother John grates on the nerves with his insufferably whiny turn as Carradine's sniveling partner . Former cowboy movie star Ken Maynard came out of retirement to do a useless bit as an elderly shopkeeper . Comic actor Doodles Weaver briefly appears as a forest ranger . Such familiar B-picture faces as William Bonner , Jennifer Bishop and Russ Meyer starlet Haji ( the latter having a very bad overbleached bouffant ' do day ) pop up as members of a sickeningly wimpy chopper gang . The Bigfoot creatures are stupendously sorry-looking : With their tatty , you-can-see-the-seams brown gorilla costumes , buggy eyes and rubbery , puffed-out monkey faces , they resemble rejects from a fifth-rate carnival freakshow . There's little action , nudity , violence or excitement to speak of ( at one point Bigfoot wrestles a portly , out-of-it bear , but even this scene is so maladroitly staged that it fails to alleviate the incessant tedium ) . But there's plenty of dreadful dialogue ( " As a former student of archeology I recognize these markings as having a peculiar significance " ) . Among the other malevolent cinematic blunders to be found within this beyond bad Bigfoot bogusity are stubbornly stationary cinematography , a hopelessly dated " groovy " semi-psychedelic rock score , a draggy pace , a meandering narrative and , last and definitely least , Robert F . Slatzer's horribly ham-fisted so-called " direction . " The absolute pits .
519164	8239592	129358	1.0	A total stinker	Sasquatch spent most of the 90s toiling away in such horrendously lame'n'tame children's movie bilge as " Little Bigfoot , " " Bigfoot : The Unforgettable Encounter , " and " Big and Hairy , " which makes this regional redneck horror / action hybrid a definite anomaly , but still nothing to get all excited about . In the misty backwoods of the Okaloosa Wilderness in Annistan , Alabama , a local Bigfoot creature murders the son of all-powerful rich jerk Milton St . John ( an embarrassingly poor turn by bona-fide exploitation legend David F . Friedman ) . St . John bankrolls an expedition led by insipid nice guy Dr . David Stone ( semi-sentient walking spam chunk Rick Montana in a stupendously lousy non-performance ) to find the foul fiend . Unbeknownst to Stone , the other members of the team are a stereotypically gung-ho , trigger-happy bunch of hillbilly yahoos specifically hired by St . John to bag the beast . R . G . Arledge's lax , ham-fisted direction strikes out in every conceivable department , thereby sinking this leaden bomb to an unforgivably schlocky sub-level of rank amateurishness : the sluggish pacing , putrid acting , wafer-thin cardboard characters , ill-judged stabs at lowbrow humor , the huge letdown creature ( it's some heavy-stepping zhlub in a rubber ghoul mask and black gorilla costume ) , weak off-screen killings , and dissatisfying sudden'n'senseless ending all leave a great deal to be desired . Those looking for a fun , worthwhile Bigfoot flick are strongly advised to search elsewhere .
517968	8239592	114680	1.0	A horrendously crappy'n'sappy piece of kiddie pic schlock	In the early 90's at the height of the appallingly cutesy direct-to-video Bigfoot kiddie flick craze there had to be at least one equally atrocious and icky-sweet sentimental claptrap yeti children's movie . This disgustingly gooey made-for-Canadian TV tripe starring a hideously wimpy , mewling , lovable'n'huggable emasculated diminutive teddy bear version of the Abominable Snowman scores a definite 10 + on the Vomitably Adorable and Overextended Cinematic Stinko Scale . Burly rocker Meat Loaf snarls it up something grumpy as Big Joe Grizzly , a cocky big game hunter who's hired by an evil multi-millionaire to capture a yeti for his spoiled brat son . The yeti eludes Big Jake's clutches and stows away on a plane that flies to America . The singularly charmless Chantallese Kent portrays the sickeningly twee little girl who befriends the yeti , whom the lass names Hank . Big Jake and his bumbling assistant Blubber ( the supremely annoying Richard Howland ) nab Hank and take him to New York City . The little girl goes to the Big Apple to get Hank back . Bob Keen , a special effects make-up artist whose credits include " Hardware , " " Monkey Boy , " and the " Hellraiser " films , made his unfortunate asleep-at-the-switch directorial debut with this ghastly offal . From the uniformly dire acting to the dreadful ( markedly less then ) special effects to the teeming surplus of stomach-turning heart-warming goo to the awful soundtrack of mawkish pop-slop tunes , " To Catch A Yeti " qualifies as anything but a good catch . The absolute celluloid dregs .
518345	8239592	89745	1.0	The world ends with a whimper instead of a bang in this cruddy post-nuke sci-fi clinker	After her striking performance as Matt Dillon's unrepentant junkie nympho wife in the outstanding " Drugstore Cowboy " Kelly Lynch seemed to have one hell of a career ahead of her . Then along came the hilariously horrendous " Roadhouse " and Kelly's credibility as a serious actress went straight down the toilet . Well , it's a good thing that this deservedly obscure pot-holocaust sci-fi stinker never received much attention or otherwise Kelly would probably have never had a career to begin with . Lynch makes her unpromising and unprepossessing acting debut as Osa , who struggles to survive in your typically bleak , rotten and exacting desolate wasteland environment in which hope , jobs and especially water have become exceedingly scarce . Osa's family gets slaughtered by a bunch of mean , sneering , sadistic thugs ( Bill Moseley , Chop Top in " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2 , " pops up as one of the evil leering goons ) . After being trained to be proficient with a crossbow by obnoxiously hearty old coot Trooper , Osa proceeds to enact a harsh revenge on the thugs . Man , is this one beat flick : the leaden pace , dreadful dialogue ( " What are we going to do with you ? You ugly bag of sick st ! " ) , wooden acting , drab , plain cinematography which gives the film a bland , homely look ( the fact that the picture was shot on cheap , grainy film stock doesn't help matters any ) , curious lack of any hard , rough elements which could have supplied some desperately needed gritty conviction , an obvious climax that's telegraphed well in advance ( so much for tension ) , the meandering narrative , very colorless one-note characters ( the head nasty , snarling homosexual villain is actually named Mr . Big ! ) , poorly staged action scenes , bad guys who are too clean-cut and generic to be genuinely menacing , and , most damagingly , writer / director Oleg Egorov's pitiful inability to blend a hackneyed vengeance premise with a comparably threadbare post-nuke scenario with any flair , style , momentum or innovation all add up to one astoundingly crummy and unrewarding waste of time bomb . To sum up , this hideously lousy loser proves to be every bit as flat , arid and dreary as the barren , godforsaken desert landscape it takes place in .
519103	8239592	47507	2.0	The first and worst of the 50's yeti horror films	This rock-bottom ' 54 cheapie clinker is the first and worst fright feature made in the 50's about the legendary Abominable Snowman . This paltry carbon copy of " King Kong " ( natch ) , " The Werewolf of London , " and even the exemplary giant ant humdinger " Them ! " constitutes as a most unfortunate and inauspicious cinematic debut for the yeti . A stuffed-shirt botanist , his comparably blah assistant , and a bunch of anonymous oriental extras embark on a perilous pilgrimage into the Himalayas to discover a rare plant species . The expedition stumbles across a predatory yeti ( a very tall , gangly guy in a threadbare poorly stitched together mangy fur costume ) who in tried'n'true B-movie monster fashion makes off with the first available female he can get his grubby paws on . The team members manage to get the fair damsel back and capture the humanoid beast . They bring it to Los Angeles , only to have the ratty hairball escape and seek refuge in the City of Angel's grimy sewers . An air of total creative and budgetary impoverishment permeates every aspect of this sour lemon . There's lackluster direction by Billy Wilder's no-talent brother W . Lyle Wilder , lethargic pacing , primitive fade-outs , dry acting from a just - hitting - all - the - usual - preprogrammed - marks robotic cast , tedious running-off-at-the-mouth verbose narration ( " The first few days were uneventful , monotonous and routine , " the botanist comments early in the nonaction , a remark which serves as an apt concise critique of the film itself ) , a few stomach-knotting moments of goopy sentiment , and a pitifully unimpressive star monster . But what really deflates this celluloid lead balloon is its complete lack of any trashy vitality - - this excruciatingly sorry and static yeti stinker is so inert and lifeless that it just lies motionless on your TV screen for 71 painfully draggy and dreary minutes of sheer unbearable boredom .
518115	8239592	235245	2.0	A hideously lame'n'tame college-set horror slasher wash-out	Driven Dr . Philip Rothman ( a hopelessly insipid and less than sinister performance by Terry Lenderee ) conducts mind control experiments on students which in turn causes them to become crazy and murderous . Sound good ? Well , it sure ain't . For starters , writer / director Jerry Sangiuliano relates the meandering story at an excruciatingly sluggish pace and fails to build even a modicum of tension . Worse yet , the characters are all blah cardboard stereotypes : we've got the shameless slut ( Donna Bostany , who at least looks hot ) who sleeps with all her professors so she can earn passing grades , the no-nonsense police detective ( flatly played by Joe Lombardo ) who's determined to solve the case no matter what , and even the obligatory weirdo janitor ( Charles Lopresto , who at least looks creepy ) who's always lurking around every corner . Adding additional abject insult to already appalling injury are Larry Gelb's annoyingly shrill and redundant shivery synthesizer score , a numbing surplus of tedious talk , infrequent kill scenes , no nudity to speak of , extremely mild and largely bloodless violence , tacky 80's video game-style ( far from ) special effects , and a dissatisfying limp ending . This movie crucially lacks the necessary energy and sense of misguided enthusiasm to qualify as an enjoyably awful piece of schlock . Instead this flick is about as fun and exciting as watching two elderly turtles copulate . An immensely cruddy and unrewarding stiff .
518173	8239592	62946	2.0	An extremely dreary and forgettable clunker	Veteran character actor Marc Lawrence stars as your basic evil scientist who creates a dangerous , murderous , not-to-be-trifled race of robotic killer gorilla slaves . Lawrence's plans to overthrow the world are thwarted by a musclebound lunk ( stolidly played by former Hercules Brad Harris , who shows off his brawny chest as often as possible ) who's ventured into the doc's remote corner of the jungle in order to rescue some beautiful gal Lawrence has abducted . Seedy , grim , slow and humorless , with only the lovely presence of bodacious jungle babe Esmeralda Barros walking around mostly nude and the sporadic cheeseball gorilla gore effects offering any slight relief from Roger Morris ' static direction , a drab , talk-heavy script , uniformly stiff acting from an understandably uninspired cast , tatty production values , inert pacing , pathetically crummy and unconvincing ape suits , and a general air of ponderous , unrelenting tedium , this flick overall sizes up as a sleep-inducing dead slug of a stinker .
518890	8239592	82381	3.0	There's no gas or gusto to be found in this rusty clunker of a futuristic 80's sci-fi dud	A severe gas shortage in the near future forces the government to ban the use of automobiles altogether and make the act of driving one a punishable capitol offense . However , a feisty pocket of rebellious gear-jamming metalhead race car enthusiasts called " burners " obstinately refuse to knuckle under Uncle Sam's oppressive reign , hording what little precious gas is left and happily tearin ' their souped-up cars across the desolate desert terrain . Crusty ace driver Red ( the always exuberant Darren McGavin , carrying on with greater flair and verve than the sub-par material deserves ) and rascally fellow old-timer Indie ( the solid George Touliatos ) are two such guys , whooping it up as they constantly elude getting nabbed by a band of hard-nosed police officers who are very eager to nail their annoyingly evasive hides . While the premise - - basically a science fiction version of a Burt Reynolds-style good ol ' boy outrunning the pigs car chase romp - - has promise , it's fatally ruined by David M . Robertson's limp'n'lifeless ( non ) direction and a paltry , insufficiently thought-out bare-bones script . Moreover , the futuristic setting is depicted with a critical lack of conviction : there are no special effects to speak of , the cars look plain and antiquated , and the spartan costume designs are simply pathetic . Worse yet , the fuzzball baddies led by a sleepwalking Doug McClure are hopelessly colorless and nonthreatening ; only a murderously crazed Native American nutcase trooper ( outrageously overplayed by Alex Diakun ) radiates any necessary sense of genuine menace . The redneck protagonists are equally insipid and unprepossessing ; the picture's already slack pace screeches to a dead halt during the excruciatingly blah romantic courtship scenes between Red's wimpy estranged son Cameron ( the gratingly whiny Robert Charles Wisden ) and Indie's fiery foxy daughter Jill ( vivaciously essayed by cute brunette hottie Mary Beth Rubens ) . But the movie's grossest , most egregious and unforgivable blunders have got to be the copious , but poorly staged and thus unexciting car race sequences and a gruelingly tedious surplus of hideously banal dialogue ( sample line : " Keep your pedal down and your sunny side up " ) . So , despite some good acting and nice photography , this worthless rusty clunker overall sadly remains in teeth-gnashing neutral from the dreary start right on down to the spiritless finish .
519138	8239592	74494	5.0	A pretty mediocre and forgettable flick	This strangely colorless film blends elements from several different genres - - Mafia pictures , drug deal features , your basic shoot ' em up actionfest , and a standard car chase romp , all tied together with a mismatched buddy crime-fighting duo - - into a bland mishmash that crucially fails to develop a flavorful distinction which could have allowed all the disparate bits and pieces to jell into a pleasingly coherent and enjoyable whole . Moreover , the unmistakably British Roger Moore is horribly miscast as a partly Italian lawyer who's assigned by a powerful mob capo to nail the three brutal thugs who smuggled a million dollars worth of smack into the country by hiding the dope inside a large wooden cross . Moore , assisted by jocular grand prix professional race car driver Stacy Keach ( who gives a solid , lively performance that's much better than the insipid material deserves ) , pounds the pavement for the dirtbags and uncovers a series of double and triple crosses which lead to a shocking revelation of a grim secret stemming from Moore's shadowy past . Maurizio Lucidi's merely adequate direction remains resolutely workmanlike from start to finish , putting too much emphasis on dull chitchat during the opening and middle of the movie . In addition , the poky , erratic pace and a curious sense of unfortunate restraint prevents this picture from acquiring both the baroque style and trashy vitality it needs to seriously cook . However , things do finally come to life in the reasonably sound and exciting last half hour , with a rousing car chase and a few bloody shoot-outs enlivening the general tedium . Still , the humdrum script that was co-written by noted screenwriter Ernest Tidyman ( who also penned " Shaft " and " The French Connection " ) and future " Grease " director Randal Kleiser , sticks too closely to run-of-the-mill predictable and unsurprising crime thriller conventions , thereby making this mediocre outing a strictly middling and passable time-killer at best .
518789	8239592	212042	5.0	A strictly so-so film	Workoholic architect Mike Voray ( an engaging performance by the suave Jean-Pierre Aumont ) neglects his fed-up and unfaithful wife Lynn ( the fetching Alix Talton ) . One fateful day Lynn runs out on Mike . The police soon find out that Lynn was murdered and naturally suspect Mike of being the killer . Sound exciting ? Well , it just ain't . George Cahan's bland direction lacks flair and style . Moreover , Cahan allows the pace to plod along at a sluggish clip and crucially fails to build any tension or momentum . In addition , Bill Barrett's talky script gets bogged down in banal dialogue and sudsy soap operaish subplots . On the plus side , the Rio setting adds some much-needed exotic flavor to the tedious proceedings , Aumont's solid acting just manages to hold everything together , the supporting cast is solid , and both Americo Hoss ' stark black and white cinematography and the tasty flamenco score by Luiz Bonfra and Nicea Martins are up to speed . But overall this picture is way to slow and meandering to amount to anything more than an insipid and forgettable wash-out .
519283	8239592	79777	6.0	A not half bad , but terribly slow & lackluster 70's post-nuke sci-fi / action flick	Being the hard-core aficionado of post-apocalyptic sci-fi / action features that I am , I naturally was pretty pumped at the prospect of finally seeing this extremely rare , forgotten and elusive genre entry after taping it in its uncut entirety off of cable . I didn't really know what to expect , since this was given a spotty release by Columbia and received extremely negative reviews by the handful of critics who bothered to see it during its fleeting theatrical run . After viewing it I can now say it's neither the best nor worst of its type . Instead , it rates as a strictly middling affair that basically does the trick but never totally amounts to anything truly special or resonant . The plot set-up is standard , but serviceable enough : Following a devastating nuclear holocaust the world has thoroughly degenerated into a bleak , harsh , desolate and dangerous hellhole where all hope has been lost , food is scarce , and vicious vulturous packs of roving ragtag psycho freaks called " ravagers " loot and kill with merciless abandon . A scuzzy band of filthy no-count " ravagers " led by ruthless sleazoid Anthony James viciously rape and murder the lovely wife ( bewitching blonde Alana Hamilton ) of cagey , cautious , constantly on the move loner Richard Harris , who narrowly avoids getting bagged himself . Harris makes a risky and arduous trek across the dry , barren , perilous wasteland , befriending both a lovably crackpot army sergeant ( a delightfully dotty Art Carney ) and a sassy lass ( ravishing brunette Ann Turkel ) during his journey . James and his grimy gang doggedly pursue Harris every step of the way . Harris and his newfound friends discover a heavily fortified redoubt run by benevolently jovial and avuncular dictator Ernest Borgnine . James and his foul flunkies close in to attack the fortress . Donald Sanford's neatly realized script keeps the story moving and further offers a provocative theme addressing the difficulty of regaining hope in the wake of a severe catastrophe which has rendered the world a most feral , unkind and godforsaken place . Unfortunately , Richard Compton's uneven direction runs hot and cold throughout , thereby scuppering a good deal of the sound script's potential . The film gets off to a cracking start , sags a lot at mid-point by becoming much too dull , talky and sluggish , but luckily gets back on thrilling track with a genuinely rousing conclusion . The cast is uniformly solid : Harris does well as the plausibly rumpled and rundown survival-weary protagonist , the ever-slimy lanky beanpole James makes for a splendidly scurvy villain , and both Turkel and Hamilton are quite charming as well as real easy on the eyes . Seymour Cassel as a doomed blind lawyer and the always dignified Woody Strode as a shrewd survivalist contribute nifty cameos . Fred Karlin's stirring score and Vincent Saizis ' grungy cinematography are likewise up to par . Tasty trivia tidbit : Gilda Texter , the cute blonde naked girl on the motorcycle in " Vanishing Point , " designed the ratty costumes . Alas , the often painfully poky pacing , infrequent outbursts of reasonably effective , albeit rather bland action , much too tame violence , and , most damagingly , a restrictive PG rating which prevents the picture from completely achieving the raw , gritty , no-holds-barred ferocious tone this baby desperately needs to fully work prevent " Ravagers " from being an all-out knock-your-socks-off winner . If it was only more lively and down'n'dirty nasty in both its content and execution then " Ravagers " would have rocked . As it is , very flawed and imperfect , but not without a few substantial merits , it's passable , but altogether nothing terribly potent or spectacular .
519161	8239592	264323	8.0	A great deal of gleefully gory fun	A motley assortment of college kids on a cross country road trip take an ill-advised detour and find themselves in the quaint Southern hamlet of Pleasant Valley . They run afoul of the crazed cannibal local yokels who are celebrating their annual barbecue festival . Director / co-writer Tim Sullivan does a real bang-up job with this wickedly sick and twisted blackly humorous remake of the Herschell Gordon Lewis schlock splatter classic : Sullivan relates the story at a nonstop zippy pace , ably creates an amusing tongue-in-cheek tone ( the witty " Deliverance " dueling banjos parody is quite funny ) , and pours on the gruesome gore with infectiously demented glee ( grisly highlights include a hapless lass being quartered by horses , a guy drinking acid , a girl getting crushed by a huge bell , one poor dude having his privates eaten by a hick chick with sharp steel teeth , and a nasty double decapitation with barbed wire ) . Better still , several hot babes take off their clothes and bare their beautiful bodies . Why , we even got plenty of saucy sexual perversion going on that runs the gamut from bestiality to incestuous lesbianism ( the latter thanks to a delectable distaff pair of literal " kissin ' cousins " ) . Moreover , the game cast totally go to town on their roles . Robert Englund in particular has a field day as the jolly one-eyed Mayor Buckman . Lin Shayne as the sweetly insane Granny Boone , Giuseppe Andrews as the suavely deranged gentleman Harper Alexander , Scott Spiegel and Johnny Legend as a couple of merry singing minstrels , Wendy Kremer as wildcat hillbilly harlot Peaches , Bill McKinney as an unhinged chef , Travis Tritt as a creepy gas station attendant , Eli Roth as wacky stoner Justin , and Peter Stormare as the stuffy Professor Ackerman all likewise have a grand time with their parts . Steve Adcock's polished cinematography and Jonathan McHugh's spooky , flavorsome score do the trick just nice . A refreshingly gross and tasteless blast of a blithely depraved over-the-top comedic horror romp .
518547	8239592	78295	8.0	A gripping and suspenseful made-for-TV thriller	Sassy TV director Leigh Michaels ( an engagingly spunky and spirited performance by the lovely Lauren Hutton ) arrives in Los Angeles and moves into a swanky high-rise apartment . Some peeping tom creep starts stalking her from afar , taunting her with crank phone calls and sinister letters in the mail . But Leigh refuses to play victim and becomes determined to uncover the nut's true identity . Writer / director John Carpenter ably builds plenty of tension , maintains a brisk pace throughout , and stages one doozy of a harrowing climax . Moreover , there's a pertinent and provocative central message about how advances in technology make it easier for someone to invade another person's privacy . Hutton positively shines in the lead ; she gets fine support from David Birney as affable college professor Paul Winkless , Adrienne Barbeau as friendly lesbian coworker Sophie , Carpenter movie regular Charles Cyphers as unhelpful police detective Paul Hunt , Grainger Hines as smarmy technician Steve , and Len Lesser as a menacing burly man . Rober Hauser's sharp , polished cinematography and Harry Sukman's classy , rousing , shivery score are both up to par . Well worth a look .
518991	8239592	70174	8.0	A truly weird and original one-of-a-kind oddity	Nebraska in the early 1900's : Dour , serious Oriole ( flinty Christina Raines ) and sweet , flighty Acacia ( the adorable Hilarie Thompson ) are a couple of strange half-breed sisters who live on a remote farm in the middle of nowhere . They give food and shelter to a gang of scruffy , but basically decent bikers : cocky leader Whizzer ( amiable Keith Carradine ) , excitable yahoo Jimbang ( Scott Glenn ) , rowdy good ol ' boy Giblets ( the ever-wacky Gary Busey ) , gawky , bespectacled nerd Golly ( the likable Mike Combs ) , mute Chupo ( Robert Walker ) , and feisty motorcycle mama China ( sexy , spunky spitfire Doria Cook ) . Oriole puts a hex on the bikers after Giblets attempts to rape Acacia . Director / co-writer Leo Garen concocts a genuinely bizarre and compelling handy dandy multi-genre period biker Gothic horror-Western combo that emphasizes a spooky and ambiguous atmosphere over snappy pacing and cheap scare scenes . This gloriously gaga feature perfectly epitomizes the anything-goes screwball experimental sensibility of the early 70's ; this in turn gives the movie a certain peculiar appeal . Charles Rosher , Jr . ' s pretty , picturesque cinematography makes snazzy use of fades , dissolves and freeze frames . Charles Bernstein's eerie , offbeat , flavorsome hillbilly bluegrass score likewise hits the spot . Dan " Grizzly Adams " Haggerty pops up in a small role as macho hot rodder Brother Billy . An engaging and interesting only-in-the-70's cinematic curio .
519388	8239592	83959	8.0	An enjoyably trashy early 80's low-budget " ALIEN " rip-off	Made right after the splendidly schlocky " Galaxy of Terror , " this choice cheesy chunk of early 80's sci-fi / horror drive-in exploitation junk rates as yet another lovably low-rent two-cent Roger Corman gem . This time a toothy , voracious rampaging mutant beast terrorizes a bunch of hapless folks in a remote outpost on a hostile desert planet . Allan Holzman's blunt'n'basic direction maintains a ceaseless snappy pace throughout and pours on the gruesome slimy gore with rip-snorting go-for-it aplomb . The ever-cool Jesse ( " Macon County Line " ) Vint makes for an excellent surly anti-hero as intergalactic troubleshooter Mike Colby . Late , great eccentric character actor Fox Harris ( the brain-fried lobotomized scientist who drives the car with the radioactive alien corpses in the trunk in the fantastic sci-fi cult black comedy blast " Repo Man " ) has a scenery-gulping hammy field day as a twitchy flipped-out physician whose cancerous liver is fed to the monster at the picture's incredible conclusion ( the grody thing literally pukes its guts out after eating the lethal organ ! ) . Better still , this fine freaky flick certainly doesn't skimp on the copious gratuitous nudity : adorable baby doll beauty Dawn Dunlap bares her whole bod while bagging a few rays in a sauna , stupendously slinky British blonde bombshell June Chadwick ( Lydie on the short-lived " V " TV series ) happily hops in the sack with Colby a mere five or six hours after making his acquaintance , and both Dawn and June even take a shower together . Susan Justin's obscenely heavy-breathing score , the cramped , claustrophobic set design , Holzman's rapid-fire editing and Tim Suhrstedt's appropriately lurid cinematography are all likewise up to par as well . A delightfully trashy hoot .
519329	8239592	56648	8.0	A really fun Japanese giant creature flick	This comment is on the original Japanese version of the film . A group of researchers investigate the disappearance of two colleagues in the mountains of northeastern Japan . They discover lethal and ill-tempered behemoth prehistoric lizard Varan , who awakens and makes an immediate beeline to Tokyo with the specific intent of trashing the town . Can the military stop Varan before it's too late ? Director Ishiro Honda expertly creates an intriguingly eerie atmosphere in the opening third of the picture and does a bang-up job of maintaining a brisk , exciting and unrelenting forward-ho momentum in the thrilling second half . Moreover , Honda stages the expected mondo destructo stuff ( Varan totals a village ) and pitched confrontations with the army with rip-snorting flair and gusto to spare . The flying , reptilian , spike-backed Varan makes for a truly fearsome titanic beast . Kudos are also in order for the snazzy special effects , Hajime Koizumi's sharp widescreen black and white cinematography , the credible acting from a solid cast , the bleakly serious tone , and Akira Ifukube's lively , stirring , all-out orchestral score . A hugely enjoyable montermash .
519332	8239592	70325	8.0	A hugely enjoyable low-budget " Bonnie and Clyde " cash-in copy	The Florida Everglades in the 1920's . Shrewd , handsome John Ashley ( a surprisingly solid turn by 50's rock'n'roll teen idol Fabian Forte , who also played Pretty Boy Floyd in Larry Buchanan's " A Bullet for Pretty Boy " ) and his sweet , flighty steady gal pal Laura ( a charming performance by the ever-radiant Karen Black ) are the leaders of an outlaw gang . The wild'n'rowdy bunch achieve considerable notoriety by robbing banks , running booze , breaking out of jail , and eluding the cops while embarking on a jolly crime spree in the southeast . Directed with a reasonable amount of flair and style by Luke Moberly and Bob Woodburn ( who also wrote the colorful and eventful script ) , this picture sizes up an an immensely enjoyable little " Bonnie and Clyde " cash-in copy . Fabian and Black make for a rather unlikely , but genuinely appealing and attractive criminal couple . Nice supporting contributions by Ken Miller as lecherous gang member Hanford , Paul Gleason as a hard-nosed sheriff , and Ivy Thayer as Laura's forlorn , regretful mother . Cliff Frates and Evie Karafotias are extremely cute and endearing as John and Laura as little kids in touching flashback sequences . Edmund Gibson's pretty , picturesque cinematography , Bill Walker's jaunty swing band score , the flavorsome period atmosphere ( the sepia-tinted black and white opening newsreel with a stern Walter Winchell-like narrator is especially tasty ) , and several rousing shoot-outs all likewise hit the spot . My sole criticism : the frequent groovy modern rock songs and music are painfully inappropriate and anachronistic . That minor quibble aside , this film overall rates as a tremendously fun and spirited romp .
519337	8239592	74228	8.0	A hugely enjoyable 70's redneck crime / action exploitation treat	Bored and brassy small town carhop waitress and aspiring country singer Bobbie Jo Baker ( a splendidly sassy'n'sexy portrayal by the luscious Lynda Carter of TV's " Wonder Woman " fame ) hooks up with brash wannabe Billy the Kid-style modern-day fugitive Lyle Wheeler ( a wonderfully robust and engaging performance by Marjoe Gortner ) and his rowdy gang of outlaws . The wild'n'crazy bunch embark on a merry crime spree in dusty New Mexico . Directed with tremendous rip-roaring flair by Mark Lester , with a compact , colorful script by " Unholy Rollers " director Vernon Zimmerman , a constant fast pace , bright , sunny cinematography by Stanley Wright , occasional outbursts of bloody violence , plenty of rousing action ( the car chases and shoot-outs are staged with considerable exciting aplomb ) , Carter's legendary eye-popping topless scenes , the catchy , reflective theme song " City Lights " sung by Bobby Bare , and an uncompromisingly downbeat ending , this sturdy little item really delivers the satisfying lowdown trashy exploitation picture goods . The bang-up cast qualifies as another substantial asset : Merrie Lynn Ross as Bobbie Jo's bubbly sister Pearl , Jesse Vint as Pearl's volatile boyfriend Slick , the adorable Belinda Balaski as Bobbie Jo's sweet best gal pal Essie , Gerrit Graham as groovy hippie commune leader Magic Ray , Gene Drew as mean hillbilly Sheriff Hicks , and " Devil Times Five " screenwriter John Durren as equally nasty Deputy Abel Gance . A fun romp .
517948	8239592	65481	8.0	Shelley Winters excels in this enjoyably sleazy Depression-era mobster winner	The late , great , sorely missed Shelley Winters really lets it all hang out with her savage , forceful and brave portrayal of notorious Depression-era crime matron Kate " Ma " Barker , who along with her twisted sons embarks on a wild anything-goes crime spree in the Deep South . Her ungodly dysfunctional brood includes a scrawny and sweaty Robert De Niro as a pathetic heroin addict , Don Stroud as a volatile , temperamental brute , and Robert Walden of TV's " Lou Grant " fame as a sniveling passive homosexual with dominating Bruce Dern as his gay lover ( ! ) . Expertly directed by legendary B-movie maestro Roger Corman from an unsparingly harsh and caustic script by Robert Thom ( who also wrote the acrid screenplays for " Wild in the Streets , " " Death Race 2000 , " and " The Witch Who Came from the Sea " ) , this squalid whitetrash crime melodrama packs one hell of a mean and lingering punch . Kudos are in order for the uniformly excellent acting from a first-rate cast , with especially praiseworthy work by Pat Hingle as a rich businessman who's abducted by the dastardly Barker clan and Diane Varsi as a hardened , much-abused hooker . A very young and skinny pre-stardom De Niro is a real stand-out as a pitiful junkie who resorts to sniffing glue when he can't find any smack to shoot up . ( Winters actually recommended to Corman that he cast De Niro in this role . ) The conclusion likewise rates as a total corker , with Winters maniacally ranting and raving like an absolute lunatic as the police surround the Barker house . Winters also played Ma Barker on the " Batman " TV show . This gritty gangster gem rates highly as one of Corman's best and most underrated movies .
519225	8239592	96142	8.0	A good'n'goofy piece of total unapologetic late 80's low budget comic horror trash	As this film's gloriously bold title alone suggests this sure ain't no exceptionally smart , subtle and sophisticated work of remarkable cinematic art . Instead it's total unmitigated lowbrow crap , plain and simple ( with a definite emphasis on the simple , too ) . The so-called plot concerns two overaged , but very fetching sorority pledges and a trio of moronic , obnoxious frat boys who have to break into a bowling alley late at night and steal a bowling trophy as part of an initiation prank . The dim-witted quintet accidentally unleash a mischievous and diabolical imp who speaks with a pretty dreadful ersatz African American accent ; said troublesome little bugger gleefully wreaks plenty of enjoyably inane tongue-in-cheek supernatural havoc upon the idiotic collegians . Tireless celluloid dreckmeister supreme David ( " Creepazoids , " " Deadly Embrace " ) DeCoteau keeps the silly shenanigans bumping along at a reasonably quick clip , the nonstop sophomoric gags are quite amusing in an admittedly crude sort of way , and both the cinematography and production values are surprisingly slick given the paltry nickel'n'dime budget . Moreover , immortal 80's trash horror scream queen Linnea ( " Silent Night , Deadly Night , " " The Return of the Living Dead " ) Quigley contributes a spirited and engaging performance as a spunky punkette burglar while the always reliable George " Buck " Flower lends able support as a frisky , doddering , irascible old coot of a hopelessly senile janitor . Better still , the sexy , slinky , smoldering Brinke ( " The Slumber Party Massacre " ) Stevens takes an utterly gratuitous , but much-appreciated lengthy shower and buxom brunette honey Michelle ( " Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers " ) Bauer spends the bulk of her screen time in the buff . Of course this film overall is essentially an extremely cheesy , lamebrained and worthless hunk of absolute junk , but this baby nonetheless still constitutes as one of those true schlock movie rarities : it's a thoroughly shameless , pointless and witless rip-snorting snotwad of a flick that's every bit as blithely tacky and trashy as its glaringly obvious title would suggest . I plead guilty as charged on the grounds that I dug every last sublimely stupid minute of this braindead timewaster .
518455	8239592	109550	8.0	A real creepfest	Troubled young Elizabeth ( well played by the lovely Louise Salter ) goes to a remote Crimean island to investigate the death of her father and the disappearance of a missing friend . The island is populated by a bizarre order of sinister nuns who reside in a convent . Assisted by the friendly Sarah ( an engaging performance by Venera Simmons ) , Elizabeth uncovers some dark secrets pertaining to her past and discovers an ancient evil force in the bowels of the convent . Director / co-writer Mariano Baino shows a remarkably sharp and stunning eye for unnerving visuals . Moreover , Baino does an expert job of creating and maintaining a compellingly spooky atmosphere and punctuates the picture with occasional outbursts of startlingly brutal violence . The grim , brooding tone gets more progressively gloomy and unsettling as the story unfolds and culminates in an especially chilling last third . The island setting projects a potent sense of dread and isolation . While the narrative is a bit vague , the suffocating brooding mood keeps the film on track and really gets under your skin . Another interesting aspect of the picture is that men are relegated to minor roles ; the main characters are all female . It's this willingness to break from standard horror conventions that in turn gives this movie an extra refreshing edge . Alex Howe's handsome , fluid cinematography , Igor Clark's shuddery score , and the uncompromisingly bleak ending all further enhance the overall nightmarish quality of this supremely eerie shocker .
518473	8239592	53072	8.0	A delightfully dippy piece of vintage 50's sci-fi camp	A quintet of folks - - stalwart Steve Dayton ( stolid Richard Travis ) , his plucky gal pal June Saxton ( pretty Cathy Downs ) , kindly old scientist Dirk Green ( affable Michael Whalen ) , brash escaped convict Gary Fennell ( sparky Tommy Cook ) and his whiny buddy Lon ( jittery Gary Clarke ) - - fly off in a rocket ship to the moon . The discover a race of attractive lunar ladies led by the blind the Lido ( essayed with lip-smacking relish by K . T . Stevens ) who are running low on oxygen and want to leave their planet as soon as possible . Clumsily directed with total seriousness by Richard Cunha , with plain cinematography by Meredith Nicholson , flat acting , a trite , talky script , an overwrought full-bore orchestral score by Nicholas Carras , sluggish pacing , laughable dialogue , tacky ( far from ) special effects , and uproariously obvious cardboard sound stages , this infamous nifty 50's low-budget sci-fi camp classic provides plenty of goofy entertainment and a sizable number of unintentional chuckles . The rock monsters in particular are a total hoot ; they resemble pumped-up pernicious versions of Gumby . The giant fake rubbery puppet spider likewise makes for a positively gut-busting shoddy sight to behold . Moreover , the lunar ladies are all undeniably lovely , with Nina Bara clearly copping the top honors as the selfish and insolent Alpha . Good , silly kitsch fun .
519275	8239592	64624	8.0	The luscious Christina Lindberg heats up the screen in this enjoyable soft-core romp	Sweet , naive , yet lovely and enticing virginal 16-year-old innocent country girl Inga ( the delectable Christina Lindberg of " Thriller : A Cruel Picture " fame in her film debut ) goes to the city to spend the weekend with her older , more worldly and experienced sister Greta ( yummy blonde Monica Ekman ) and her cad boyfriend Casten ( the extremely jerky Krister Ekman ) . Inga gets in touch with her budding sexuality , loosens up , and learns the joys of booze , dancing , and intercourse . Casten's equally loutish friend Bjorn ( homely beanpole Leif Naeslund ) forces himself on Inga on their first date , but she falls for the creep anyway ! When Inga decides to take a bath one fateful day , Casten naturally can't help but join the luscious lass for some splashy carnal fun ( can anyone blame the guy ? ) . Director Dan Wolman relates the sordid coming-of-age story at a steady pace and delivers plenty of tasty nudity and steamy soft-core sex scenes . The central plot clearly imitates Joe Sarno's sexploitation classic " Inga . " ( Ironically , Lindberg went on to appear in the Sarno flicks " Swedish Wildcats " and " Young Playthings " ! ) . Not surprisingly , Wolman shows off Christina's awesomely abundant physical attributes as often as possible : Lindberg disrobes with pleasing regularity , masturbates in bed after catching Greta and Casten making love , cools off with a shower ( shot in sensuous slow motion for extra erotic effect ) , and performs her sex scenes with scorching lusty abandon . Moreover , she also manages to deliver a touching and natural performance in her first lead role . Hasse Welin's pretty cinematography leers over Christina's fabulously voluptuous figure with undisguised lascivious intent while the catchy soundtrack boasts plenty of tuneful folksy rock songs . Highly recommended viewing for Christina Lindberg fans .
518983	8239592	74294	8.0	An enjoyably campy hoot	Conniving little weasel Eddie " the Cat " Murkil ( expertly played to the sniveling obnoxious hilt by David Kyle , who later quit acting to become a youth minister ! ) is a cunning adolescent psychopath who ruthlessly bumps off Punch ( a nifty , albeit brief appearance by Derrel Maury of " Massacre at Central High " fame ) , the leader of the teenage hoodlum gang the Silks . Cat makes it look like the rival Latino gang the Ruedas did it . This leads to a violent gang war . Pretty soon the body count begins to pile up at an alarming rate ( the definite highlight occurs when two scrawny 14-year-old members of the Silks sneak into a high school locker room to shiv two members of the Ruedas in the shower ! ) . Clearly intended as some kind of grim cautionary tale about teen gangs and adolescent violence on the rise in major cities , this unjustly overlooked 70's drive-in juvenile delinquent exploitation item qualifies as a real campy hoot . Director John Bushelman takes the whole silly story very seriously , which in turn gives this goofy marvel a certain endearingly clunky charm . Bruce Logan's polished cinematography gives the film a sharp , glossy look . Better still , both the amusingly insipid soft-rock theme song " Slow Down Baby " and especially Bernie Kaai Lewis ' funky garage rock score are hilariously cheesy . Popping up in snazzy supporting roles are Rhodes Reason and Doug McGrath as two hard-nosed police detectives , Steve Bond as Murkil's incarcerated older brother who's struggling to go straight , Doodles Weaver as a gas station owner and " Beverly Hills Cop " film series regular John Ashton as a high school football coach . Good dumb fun .
518562	8239592	69986	8.0	A deliciously cheesy hoot	Evil madman Eamon O'Reilly ( veteran villain character actor Michael Ansara in peak suavely sinister form ) and his army of cutthroat mercenaries acquire possession of a deadly plague virus . Feisty government agent Sabrina Kincaid ( well played by ravishing redhead Francine York ) rounds up a bunch of lovely , yet lethal lady assassins who include exotic dancer Lavella Sumara ( voluptuous knockout Tura Satana ) , Olympic swimmer Sharon O'Connor ( slender blonde looker Leigh Christian ) , and psychiatrist Elizabeth White ( foxy brunette Judy McConnell ) to thwart O'Reilly before it's too late . Director / co-writer Ted V . Mikels loads this baby with more than enough spirited schlockiness to ensure that fans of cheapo 70's kitsch will be in hog heaven : we've got hot babes aplenty , ineptly staged action scenes ( the clumsy martial arts fights are especially sidesplitting ) , a groovy swingin ' funk soul score by Nicholas Carras , a tacky solarized opening credits sequence , surprisingly bloody violence , gloriously ghastly ( far from ) special effects , garish color cinematography by Anthony Salinas , a constant snappy pace , acceptable acting from a game cast , and a plot which serves as a basic blueprint for the suspiciously similar popular TV series " Charlie's Angels . " Popping up in nifty supporting roles are Anthony Eisley as smooth CIA head honcho Victor Connelly , John Carter as the worried Senator Carter , Lisa Todd as Eamon's enticing mistress Maria , Rafael Campos as twitchy junkie flunky Rafael , William Bagdad as brutish henchman Joseph , and Herb Robins as nasty hit-man Munson . A total campy riot .
518409	8239592	130637	8.0	An offbeat horror mood piece	Troubled young Grace MacDonald ( well played by ravishing redhead Brooke Mills ) works as an assistant for itinerant carnie faith healer preacher Reverend Jesse Bundy ( essayed with tremendous rip-snorting gusto by Michael Pataki ) and can't get over her obsession with finding her long lost father . Grace eventually runs across her pop Timothy MacDonald ( a fine , robust performance by Edmond O'Brien ) , but he turns out to be crazy , overprotective and dangerous . Or is Grace just imagining that her dad is still alive ? Writer / director John Hayes relates the compellingly quirky story at a leisurely pace and does an expert job of creating and maintaining a creepy , surreal , dreamlike atmosphere . Paul Hipp's bright , lush cinematography and Jaime Mendoza-Nava's spooky , melancholy score further enhance the pervasive mood of abstract eeriness . Moreover , there's nice supporting performances by Paul Prokop as Grace's kindly , concerned fiancé Dr . Patrick Bundy , Marc Lawrence as a sinister undertaker who works as a pimp on the side , and Arthur Franz as a helpful psychiatrist . Despite a heavy languid air and the often murky plot ( a grimly sober narrator occasionally chimes in to give the oblique story some much-needed coherence ) , this intriguingly ambiguous picture somehow manages to cast a strangely hypnotic spell on the viewer . An interesting oddity .
518901	8239592	118075	8.0	Another worthy entry in this delightful series	Blithely naughty virtual reality hooker Heidi Ho ( deliciously essayed to campy'n'vampy perfection by buxom blonde babe J . J . North ) gets unleashed from a computer by the commissioner's geeky son Irwin ( a nice'n'nerdy turn by Chad Gabbert ) and goes on a libidinous rampage . It's up to scatterbrained ditz Candy ( the adorably daffy Elizabeth Kaitan ) and her snarky new partner Traci ( sassy brunette spitfire Raelyn Saalman ) to stop Heidi Ho . Meanwhile , starchy repressed spinster supreme Miss Devonshire ( the terrific Jayne Hamil ) tries to salvage her floundering marriage with the cocky , yet clueless commissioner ( Jay Richardson in fine pompous form ) . Once again writer / director Rick Sloane hits the crudely amusing bull's eye with plenty of spot-on lowbrow japes about such certifiably gut-busting subjects as undercover lady cops being beaten up by prostitutes , sexual harassment , catfights , bad practical jokes , and nasty sexually transmitted computer virus diseases . This flick further benefits from spirited acting by a sturdy cast : Kaitan and Saalman make for a suitably sexy mismatched team , Tane McClure has a neat supporting role as bitchy , meddlesome councilwoman Jean Capri , Michael Kayem is a total hoot as stuck-up sexist pig stud muffin patrolman Petrolino , and Honey Lauren adds a little extra sauciness as brash sex therapist Dr . Tiffany Berkowitz . Stephen Crawford's cinematography is merely adequate while both the insanely crankin ' theme song " Pistol Whipped " and Alan DerMarderisian's funky score do the gnarly trick . Plus this picture doesn't skimp on the yummy distaff eye candy : North , Saalman and Kaitan all have much-appreciated topless scenes . Essential viewing for fans of this always enjoyable series .
519180	8239592	53219	8.0	An entertaining sequel to the classic original	Late scientist Andre Delambre's ambitious son Philippe ( a solid and sympathetic performance by the handsome Brett Halsey ) decides to continue his father's experiments with teleportation . His worried uncle Francois ( the always superb Vincent Price ) disapproves . Philippe gets betrayed by his treacherous assistant Ronald Holmes ( a pleasingly slimy turn by David Frankham ) , who turns poor Philippe into a grotesque half-man , half-fly hybrid creature . Writer / director Edward Bernds eschews the heart-wrenching pathos of the first picture in favor of a less subtle , but still enjoyably lurid crime noir sensibility . The good acting from an able cast helps a lot : Halsey does impressive work in the lead , Price makes a welcome return , plus there are praiseworthy contributions by Dan Seymour as sleazy fat hoodlum Max Berthold , John Sutton as the helpful Inspector Beechum , the luscious Danielle De Metz as Philippe's charming and comely fiancé Cecile Bonnard , and Janine Grandel as loyal housekeeper Madame Bonnard . Brydon Baker's crisp black and white widescreen cinematography gives the movie an effectively gritty look . The moody , rousing score by Paul Sawtell and Bert Shefter likewise does the trick . The mutated fly-man is genuinely creepy . One definite skin-crawling highlight occurs when Holmes crosses a luckless police officer with a guinea pig ( Holmes actually crushes said squealing guinea pig with shockingly sadistic relish ! ) . Nice , pulpy fun .
519274	8239592	122070	8.0	A fun 80's slasher flick	Hot-tempered macho jerk Charlie ( the extremely annoying John Batis ) and his more amiable easygoing buddy Steve ( likable Dean Russsell ) go hiking in a remote forest . Their wives Sharon ( pretty brunette Tomi Barrett ) and Teddi ( lovely blonde Ann Wilkinson ) also go camping in the same exact woodland area . They not only run afoul of crazed cannibal hermit John ( well played by burly B-flick perennial Gary Kent ) , but also encounter the ghosts of his slain adulterous wife ( a memorably bitchy Jeanette Kelly ) and his children Jennifer ( cute Becki Burke ) and John , Jr . ( future " Silver Spoons " TV sitcom regular Corky Pigeon ) . Competently directed by Don Jones ( who has a small role as a friendly forest ranger ) , with solid acting from a capable cast , a deliciously cheesy flesh-crawling synthesizer score by Richard Hieronymus and Alan Oldfield , nice dollops of ghastly gore , rough , grainy , but pretty polished cinematography by Stuart Asbjorsen , a steady pace , a good deal of tension ( the opening murder set piece is especially strong and suspenseful ) , several corny soft-rock songs occasionally blaring away on the soundtrack , engaging well-drawn characters , an eerie tone ( the offbeat and inspired supernatural element greatly adds to the overall creepiness ) , and stark and unflinching outbursts of raw violence , this film does the trick as a really enjoyable backwoods horror item . Familiar character actor Stafford ( " Cleopatra Jones , " " The Alpha Incident " ) Morgan briefly appears as one of John's victims . Fans of slice'n'dice body count movies should probably dig this one a lot .
517969	8239592	435631	8.0	A hugely enjoyable piece of low-budget horror / action trash	Rough'n'tumble half-breed holy akicker demon hunter Jake Greyman ( a superbly rugged portrayal by Sean Patrick Flanery of " The Boondock Saints " ) fights various forms of evil for the Catholic Church . He's assigned by Cardinal White ( nicely played by William Bassett ) to stop nefarious lustful hell spawn Asmodeus ( a marvelously creepy and reptilian Billy Drago ) and his loyal servant Succubus ( gorgeous brunette knockout Tania Deighton , who sports cute little horns ) from procreating with fallen Los Angeles prostitutes . Compassionate unorthodox nun Sarah Ryan ( a likable performance by striking hottie Colleen Porch ) helps Jake out on his desperate mission . The fate of mankind hangs in the balance . Director Scott Ziehl , working from a blithely schlocky script by Mitch Gould , loads this enjoyably silly supernatural claptrap with several rousing bash ' em up fight scenes , a decent smattering of gratuitous nudity , a dab of grisly gore , and even a smidgen of steamy soft-core sex . Moreover , Ziehl keeps the pace rattling along at a satisfying steady clip throughout this movie's short'n'sweet 78 minute running time . Flanery's scruffy , apathetic and cynical character makes for an engagingly hard-around-the-edges anti-hero . Robert C . New's slick , agile cinematography , the wailin ' , head-bangin ' rock soundtrack , Jon Lee's roaring score , and some laughably lousy CGI effects further add to the overall entertainingly trashy fun .
518114	8239592	74383	8.0	Gloriously ludicrous 70's martial arts exploitation trash	A multi-racial trio of lethal and indestructible ace martial artist assassins - white guy ( beefy Ron Marchini ) , black dude ( brawny Joshua Johnson ) , Asian man ( lithe Michael Chong ) - - go around the city and bump off various folks for their evil dragon lady boss Madame Lee ( a hysterically campy and vampy Mari Honjo , who can barely speak English and mumbles all her dialogue ) . Boy , does this deliciously dippy and dreadful dreck possess all the right wrong stuff to qualify as an enjoyably awful piece of gut-busting schlock : we've got fumbling ( mis ) direction by Paul Kyriazi ( who also co-wrote the nonsensical script ) , lousy acting from a lame no-name cast , a token hot naked babe , crude cinematography by Donald Rust , hilariously inept fight choreography ( sidesplitting highlights include the death machines wiping out an entire school of karate students , the white guy beating up dozens of cops while escaping from a police station , and our deadly threesome opening up a king-sized barrel of hurting on a biker gang in a diner ) , slipshod editing , excessively bloody tomato paste-style violence , and a stupid " it ain't over yet " sequel set-up ( non ) ending . Bonus booby points are in order for Chuck Katzakian's alarmingly overblown portrayal of hot-tempered crime boss Mr . Gioretti and the supremely wired'n'wonky zoned to the funky bone synthesizer score by Don Hulette . In fact , this uproariously messed-up movie often plays like an unintentional ( ? ) parody of a cheesy 70's drive-in action flick . An absolute cruddy hoot .
518635	8239592	100707	8.0	A strong , gritty and disturbing portrait of the grim plight of destitute homeless kids	From the makers of the phenomenal , trend-setting " psycho murders peel artists " milestone " Stripped to Kill " and the outstanding offbeat existential vampire horror knockout " Dance of the Damned " comes this grim , tough , unflinchingly realistic down'n'dirty exploitation thriller about young , strung-out , totally on her own illiterate Venice Beach , Los Angeles prostitute Dawn ( a strong , unglamorous , very endearing and somewhat startling performance by Christina Applegate ; Kelly Bundy on " Married . . . With Children " ) , a fiercely self-reliant teenager who turns tricks in order to eke out a meager existence and support her heroin habit . Dawn has a near-fatal run-in with brutish , sadomasochistic sleazy teen hooker killing cop Lumley ( a cogent , creepy , live-wire portrayal of frighteningly deep-seated seething psychosis by Ed Lottimer ) , who relentlessly stalks Dawn and savagely picks off her scruffy homeless street people pals throughout the rest of the movie . David Mendenhall offers a solid and likable turn as the naive , slumming rich kid who develops a crush on Dawn and gets caught up in her tawdry and thankless day-to-day lifestyle . " Streets " is something of a surprise : it's a gritty , gutsy little B picture ( Roger Corman gets credited as the executive producer ) that successfully manages to relate a compact , seamy , highly credible slasher narrative while simultaneously delivering a rich and vivid exploration of how unemployed folks at the bottom rung of the socioeconomic ladder somehow manage to barely squeak by and how people with real power and authority in our society can get away with cruelly preying on those hapless and helpless individuals whose utter powerlessness and political vulnerability make them easy targets for constant victimization . Katt Shea Ruben's sturdy , no-nonsense , unsentimental direction ( Ruben also co-wrote the rough-edged , pungently insightful script ) , the garishly lit , evocative cinematography , a brooding melancholy score ( the sad , haunting ballad that's beautifully sung by Elizabeth Daily which plays on the soundtrack during the opening and end credits is especially poignant and effective ) , the top-notch acting ( besides the three excellent leads , both Kay Lenz and Starr Andreeff have nice cameos as lady police officers ) , an authentically grungy depiction of L . A . ' s desolate beach-side milieu , and the uncompromisingly downbeat ending all give this shamefully overlooked and underrated scrappy gem a potent scroungy verisimilitude that's extremely compelling and powerful . A real sleeper .
519358	8239592	117826	8.0	An amusingly lowbrow horror comedy romp	Goody-goody two shoes Katherine Verdoux ( blonde cutie Erica Eleniak ) hires sleazy private investigator Rafe Gutman ( a deliciously smarmy and sarcastic Dennis Miller ) to finding her obnoxious missing punk brother Caleb ( a perfectly grating Corey Feldman ) . Rafe traces Caleb to a remote whorehouse on the edge of town that's disguised as a mortuary and populated by luscious lady vampires led by the evil and alluring Madam Lilith ( ravishing redhead Angie Everhart having a whale of a wicked time ) . Director / co-writer Gilbert Adler really pours on the tasty gratuitous female nudity , gleefully over-the-top graphic violence , and often crudely amusing dopey puns . Miller has a ball playing the slimy anti-hero ; he keeps things bouncy and funny throughout . Moreover , the solid supporting cast likewise does the trick : Chris Sarandon as slick , sanctimonious televangelist Jimmy Current , Aubrey Morris as Lilith's eccentric henchman McCutcheon , Phil Fondacaro as obsessive explorer Vincent Prather , William Sadler as a pompous mummy , and Kiara Hunter as enticing dominatrix bloodsucker Tamara . WARNING : Possible SPOILER ahead . The definite sidesplitting sick highlight occurs when Lilith's vampire harem gets slaughtered while " Ballroom Blitz " blares away on the soundtrack . Good , trashy tongue-in-cheek fun .
519448	8239592	57160	8.0	A fun 60's horror quickie	Architect Scott Campbell ( a solid Ronald Foster ) and his wife Nancy ( a spunky performance by the fetching Merry Anders ) check out an old castle located on a remote hillside in California . They are joined by lawyer Joseph Schiller ( nicely played by Richard Crane ) and his snippy spouse Loy ( a charming turn by the lovely Erika Peters ) . Moreover , there's something else in the castle that wants them out of there pronto . Competently directed by veteran journeyman Maury Dexter , with a steady pace , stark , yet polished black and white cinematography by John M . Nickolaus ( the use of fades and dissolves is quite nifty ) , a fair amount of creepy atmosphere , a tight 62 minute running time , a pleasingly shivery'n'spooky score by Henry Vars , acceptable acting , a cool array of grotesque circus freaks ( Ayllene Gibbons as a friendly fat lady and Richard Kiel as a mute , menacing giant are both especially memorable ) , and an unexpected , but satisfying ending , this pleasant little low-budget quickie makes for a perfectly painless diversion .
518081	8239592	65852	8.0	A hilariously horrible hoot from our reliably schlocky pal Al Adamson	This uproariously atrocious Al Adamson $1 . 50 sci-fi / horror patch-up job rates highly as one of Al's single most sublimely stinky pictures to ever disgrace celluloid . This beautifully bad and berserk baby boasts John Carradine at his all-time crankiest , Brother Theodore's gut-busting wheezing histrionic opening narration , poorly tinted black and white giant creature footage from the moldy oldie items " One Million Years B . C . " and " Unknown Island , " cheap cardboard spaceship sets , a quick cameo by Adamson as a vampire with wicked sideburns , a particularly ridiculous heavy-breathing sex scene , a pretty sorry trash cinema ensemble cast that includes Vicki Volante , Jennifer Bishop and Robert Dix , chintzy cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond , such hysterically goofy monsters as hairy cave-dwelling bat demons , swamp-residing lobster men , snake men , and two warring cavemen tribes , and a stupendously silly plot concerning a fearless team of astronauts traveling to a hostile alien planet so they can thwart a severe extraterrestrial vampire plague that's ravaging Earth ! This isn't by any stretch of the imagination a good movie , but it is nonetheless an often unintentionally amusing and hence hugely enjoyable Grace Z low-budget crap camp classic .
518796	8239592	265138	8.0	A hilariously ridiculous mess	Poor Maria is married to a hideously abusive and impotent old cripple . She's having an affair with the hunky gardener Roberto . Her cousin runs Roberto over with his car . Maria goes to an old witch lady and has a spell done so both she and Roberto will be reincarnated twenty years later . Cue twenty years later . Maria , sad and lonely , meets the reincarnation of Roberto , but alas he's married and hence not interested in her . So Maria enlists the aid of an evil , cackling , snake-worshiping sorcerer to cast a spell on Roberto so she can finally have him . Got that ? Well , I'm not quite sure if that above plot synopsis is entirely correct , but it's the best I can do . Director Yeung Kong fails miserably to add any much-needed coherence to this often uproariously awful and muddled mess of a supernatural romantic horror flick . Luckily , there's a wealth of tasty female nudity and a handy helping of sizzling soft-core sex scenes to keep things pleasingly sleazy throughout . ( However , in one hysterically strenuous sex scene involving the evil lascivious sorcerer and a hapless young lady a big glowing white dot covers the woman's pubic area ! ) . The funky , throbbing score , a gnarly tribe of nasty cannibal dwarfs , and a smidgen of suitably gross last reel gore further add to the strangely compelling and frequently unintentionally sidesplitting anything-goes surreal fun of this enjoyably senseless head-scratcher .
519001	8239592	87127	8.0	A deliciously cheesy chunk of early 80's low-budget sword and sorcery sleaze	Muscular blond-maned wannabe heroic scruffy barbarian Deathstalker ( the hunky Rick Hill ) gets assigned by the all powerful King Tulak to rescue his lovely fair maiden daughter Princess Codille ( stunningly beautiful'n'bountiful Playboy Playmate Barbi Benton ) from the vile clutches of evil sorcerer Oghris ( a delectably hammy performance by Richard Brooker ; Jason in " Friday the 13th Part III " ) . Aiding Deathstalker on his dangerous mission are lecherous wizard Munkar ( the funny Bernard Erhard ) , brawny mercenary Kang ( dorky Victor Bo ) , and feisty warrior babe Kaira ( the luscious Lana Clarkson ) . Director James Sbardellatti , working from a blithely low-brow script by Howard R . Cohen ( who also wrote " Unholy Rollers " and " Space Raiders " ) , loads this delightfully cheap'n'cheesy sleaze exploitation sword and sorcery fantasy romp with a tasty plenitude of gratuitous nudity ( both Barbi and Lana bare their hot bods ) , ineptly staged swordfights , mudwrestling half-naked slave girls , a reasonable amount of bloody violence , a kung-fu fight , and even a huge hulking humanoid pigman freak . Sure , this hilariously dopey dreck definitely ain't no work of sophisticated cinematic art , but it still does the trick just the same as a pleasingly trashy little hoot .
519014	8239592	113449	8.0	A deliciously cheesy serving of low-budget horror trash	Man , I can't believe the largely harsh and negative comments for this movie . Okay , it sure ain't no sophisticated work of cinematic art . But it is a good deal of entertainingly tacky fun . For starters , the titular pumpkin-headed supernatural killer dude has to be one of the single most laughably silly and unscary things to ever stumble in front of a camera ; he looks like something you would see in a fourth-rate carnival spookhouse . Secondly , the moderate gore is ridiculously fake and unconvincing , with the definite highlight occurring when this annoying uptight ultra-conservative woman gets electrocuted by a toaster . Then there's the always welcome presence of the ever-lovely Linnea Quigley , who's memorably introduced taking a nice , long , utterly gratuitous shower that goes on for two minutes . Amazingly , we also have appearances by deceased schlock picture legends John Carradine as an evil warlock and Cameron Mitchell as a horror TV show host . Moreover , scream queens Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith have fleeting cameos . Lead child actor Ryan Latshaw projects all the charm and acting ability of a moldy old tree stump . Pretty brunette Rachel Carter pops her top and bares her cute little breasts . The cruddy special effects are decidedly less than special . The score is suitably overwrought . Yet this film overall has a certain endearingly hokey appeal to it which in turn makes this honey a real delectably cheesy hoot to watch .
518219	8239592	74775	8.0	A really enjoyable Crown International Pictures crime caper romp	This on the money solid and enjoyable Crown International Pictures crime caper affair comes across like a cheerfully low-rent drive-in discount version of " Ocean's 11 . " Adding immensely to this film's already considerable entertainment value is the always charming and delightful presence of the divine Stella Stevens , who portrays the titular shady lady casino hostess with her customary winning blend of brassy firebrand panache and sassy sophisticated sexiness . Tired of her lackluster lot in life , Stevens plans on stealing a hefty multi-million dollar sum of cash from Circus Circus in order to make things better for herself . Helping Stella out with her daring heist are friendly security guard Stuart Whitman , rascally old high stakes gambler Jessie White , and the foxy salt'n'pepper distaff duo of Linda Scruggs and Lynne Moody . Standing in Stella's way is ruthless jerk casino manager George DiCenzo . Director Noel ( " Youngblood " ) Nosseck keeps the pace quick and the suspense well-maintained throughout . Moreover , the thrilling robbery itself is staged and edited with breakneck aplomb , there's a nicely funky theme song called " Gambling Blues , " Stephen Katz's sharp cinematography accurately nails the gaudiness of the Glitter Gulch in all its tacky day-glo splendor , and future big deal mainstream Hollywood feature composer Alan ( " Back to the Future , " " Predator " ) Silvestri supplies a splendidly snazzy'n'jazzy ersatz Lalo Schifrin score . Taut , involving and a definite must-see for Stella Stevens aficionados .
518536	8239592	209264	8.0	A fun giant killer snake horror creature feature romp	The considerable box office success of the deliciously cheesy " Anaconda " not surprisingly inspired a rash of derivative , yet still enjoyable low-budget direct-to-video cash-in copies . These rip-offs include the none too shabby " King Cobra , " the exceptionally fine and intelligent " Komodo , " and this snazzy little over-sized mutant killer snake outing . Once again your standard unscrupulously ambitious scientist ( a neatly quirky and understated portrayal by the always excellent Robert Englund ) has created one hell of a fast , deadly , impossible to destroy genetically enhanced people-gobbling monstrosity , a vicious python which escapes from its cage and goes on the expected mankind-noshing spree in a tiny podunk hamlet . It's up to cocky ramrod government agent Parker ( sternly played by tight-lipped latenight cable fare topliner Casper Van Dien ) to eradicate the bloodthirsty beast before things get to out of hand . Proficiently directed by Richard Clabaugh , with slick cinematography by Patrick Rousseau , an effectively spare and moody hum'n'shiver score by Daniel J . Nielsen , and across-the-board sturdy acting from a uniformly solid cast , " Python " transcends the hackneyed plot by virtue of its uncommonly sound execution alone . The bright script by Chris Neal , Paul J . M . Bogh , and Gary Hershberger has fun playing around with the standard fright film conventions , with the saucy lesbian variant on the inevitable have-sex-and-die libidinous couple cliché rating as an especially nifty touch . Better still , the unusually well-drawn and plausible characters are firmly grounded in a certain gritty everyday blue collar reality , the crummy CGI effects are amusingly tacky , and the picture commendably takes its time carefully setting up a spooky tone in the opening first act before cutting loose with an increasingly jolting series of lethal lizard attack scenes . Sexy Jenny McCarthy vamps it up delightfully as the shameless town tramp . A barely recognizable Will Wheaton contributes a likable turn as a scruffy slacker dude . Veteran character actor Ed Lauter has a nice unbilled bit part as an ill-fated army airplane pilot . Compact and smartly realized , " Python " sizes up as a pleasing and up-to-par creature feature .
517890	8239592	82565	8.0	A surprisingly bleak and brutal made-for-TV early 80's " ALIEN " clone	I must admit that I really like this jarringly harsh and downbeat made-for-TV " ALIEN " copy . This time the rugged roughneck crew of a remote off-shore oil rig are terrorized by a large , scaly , fanged , lumbering centuries old humanoid beast dredged up from the ocean floor . Sure , the plot ain't much , but Peter Carter's crisply proficient direction ( Carter previously gave us the superior and underrated Canadian " Deliverance " variant " Rituals " ) , the strikingly gloomy , fatalistic tone ( the first victim is a panicky guy who had a nightmarish premonition of the impending disaster ) , a terrific , rousing score by the chronically unsung Gil ( " A Cold Night's Death , " " The Ultimate Warrior " ) Melle , several shockingly brutal violent episodes which really test the limits of what you can get away with in a TV movie ( one luckless woman gets raped and dies giving birth to a brawny , fully grown man-sized monster ! ) , the unusually well-drawn and engaging characters , and the cool creature design by James Cummins and H . R . Giger turn this unassuming little number into a modest , but surefire winner . Chad Everett as the hard-nosed crew chief has the right tough stuff to cut it as a fine hero , while Joseph Bottoms , Jennifer Warren , Matt Craven , Lynda Mason Green and especially the ever-personable Rockne ( " Black Sampson " ) Tarkington are solid in sturdy supporting parts .
518340	8239592	491005	8.0	A nifty killer animal horror flick	A flock of ravens contract mad cow's disease and turn into vicious carnivorous beasts who attack the populace of a sleepy small town . A handful of folks who include the stalwart Police Chief Wayne Merkle ( a solid Sean Patrick Flanery ) , amiable physician Doc ( winningly played by Rod Taylor ) , and recovering alcoholic school bus driver Clyde ( the excellent Stephen McHattie ) do their best to survive this harrowing ordeal . Director Sheldon Wilson , working from a smart , tight script by Benjamin Sztajnkrycer , relates the absorbing story at a steady pace , maintains a serious tone throughout ( there's a refreshing absence of any silly humor ) , and effectively builds a considerable amount of suspense . The tense gradual build-up of the opening act eventually culminates in an especially harrowing and exciting last third . Moreover , the ravens are genuinely creepy , the explanation for the birds ' violent behavior is both plausible and topical , the CGI effects are surprisingly decent and acceptable , and there's a handy helping of grisly gore ( the mangled victims of the bird attacks look pretty nasty ) . Nice supporting performances by Kristin Booth as Wayne's caring wife Cynthia , John Ralston as superstitious Mennonite farmer Oskar , Michelle Duquet as friendly diner owner Betty , Ashley Newbrough as mean teen Doris , Gray Powell as eager deputy Stan , Vladimir Bondarenko as strict farmer Jacob , Megan Park as Oskar's sweet daughter Gretchen , and Wendy Lyon as perky police dispatcher Luanne . Both John Tarver's polished cinematography and Steven London's shuddery score are up to speed . An enjoyable fright feature .
518968	8239592	82509	8.0	A real funky blast from the 80's past	Made right before the buzz-crushing ultra-conservative religious right backlash against the gloriously loose'n'libertine permissiveness of the 70's took hold , this wonderfully wild'n'raucous animated sci-fi / horror / fantasy anthology film gleefully wallows in excessive graphic violence , crass leering objectification of the amply proportioned female form ( buxom ladies only , please ) , and a wickedly funny line in cheery low-brow humor . This movie sure ain't politically correct - - and that's exactly why it's such a hugely enjoyable blast from the funky early 80's past . An evil glowing orb called the Loknar ( the supremely sinister and velvet smooth voice of Percy Rodriguez ) spreads its malign influence throughout the decades and galaxies . First tale , " Harry Canyon " - Cynical cabbie Harry ( marvelously voiced to weary perfection by veteran character actor Richard Romanus of " Mean Streets " ) gets involved with a sexy young lass in a bleak and rundown futuristic New York . Second yarn , " Den " - A nerdy teenager ( affably voiced by the late , great John Candy ) winds up on another planet where he's transformed into a bald and brawny behemoth . Third romp , " Captain Sternn " - Sleazy scoundrel Captain Sternn stands on trail for his many heinous indiscretions . John Vernon scores strongly as the angry voice of the prosecuting attorney . Fourth opus , " B-17 " - A very creepy and gruesome World War II zombie outing . Fifth vignette , " So Beautiful and So Dangerous " - A couple of wacky aliens and their goofy robot buddy abduct a sassy hot Jewish chick . Harold Ramis and Eugene Levy are hilarious as the Cheech and Chong-style stoner pilots of a giant smiley face spaceship . Candy once again is a delight as the voice of the charming and amorous robot . Sixth outing , " Taarna " - A lethal and lovely mute warrior woman mixes it up with a vicious horde of nasty marauders . Boy , does this picture rate highly as the ideal guy flick : we've got a fantastic roaring rock soundtrack ( Cheap Trick , Black Sabbath , Devo , Grand Funk Railroad , Nazareth , Blue Oyster Cult , Journey , Stevie Nicks and much more ) , plenty of sidesplitting sophomoric humor , stunningly voluptuous and often naked women , a handy helping of gore , a nice smattering of soft-core sex , a blithely breezy'n'carefree tone , and no pretense whatsoever to get in the way of the infectiously trashy fun . The strikingly stylized and varied animation is suitably vivid and garish throughout . Elmer Bernstein's lush majestic orchestral score likewise hits the spot . A real cool treat that's wholly deserving of its cult status .
518133	8239592	90564	8.0	A very cool and enjoyable 80's teen gang romp	" Class of 1984 " meets " High Noon " and subsequently gets transposed to the blighted , crime-ridden East Los Angeles ghetto area in this really solid and effective teen gang opus . A vicious street gang called the Cobras holds a reign of terror over Lincoln High School . Stand-up , no-nonsense tough guy Jeff Hanna ( a commanding and believable performance by " My Bodyguard " ' s hulking Adam Baldwin ) quits the Cobras and decides he wants to live a normal , peaceful life . Alas , Jeff incurs the formidable wrath of savage , vengeful Cobra leader Cinco ( a perfectly vile Danny De La Paz ) when he refuses to take a dive for Cinco during a surprise police drug bust . So Cinco vows that he's gonna clean Jeff's clock but good come 3 : 15 after school , clinching the odds that Jeff will definitely show up for this lethal rumble by beating up Jeff's sweet newfound girlfriend Sherry ( an endearing turn by the lovely , cuddly Deborah Foreman ) . Granted , the plot provided by Sam Bernard and Michael Jacobs ' blunt , no-frills , just cover all the necessary bases and nothing more script doesn't offer any fresh insights or novel twists on a timeworn Western-style big showdown premise . However , Larry Gross ' precise , straightforward direction , Gary Chang's neatly percolating score , Misha Suslov's slick , smoothly gliding cinematography , a refreshing lack of pretense , and a thrilling finale with Jeff opening up a king-sized dose of raw , bloody hurting on the Cobras more than compensates for the dearth of originality . Plus , the supporting cast is totally up to snuff : " Benson " ' s Rene Auberjonois as the school's manipulative Machiavellian principal , Ed Lauter as a cynical , world-weary cop , Wings Hauser as Sherry's overprotective jerk dad , Mario Van Peebles as a black gang leader , 80's horny teen regular Scott McGinnis in one of his standard smart-mouthed wiseguy roles , Joseph Brutsman as Jeff's loyal nerdy pal Marvin , and future " Showgirls " hottie Gina Gershon as a snarly Cobra gang moll . All in all , this flick's certainly punchy and violent enough to make the grade as a satisfying item .
518450	8239592	71216	8.0	Good , sexy , trashy 30's Depression-era set 70's drive-in exploitation fun	Tough and gutsy Texas widow Wilma McClatchie ( a splendidly brassy'n'sassy Angie Dickinson , looking mighty fine in her early 40's and frequently out of her wardrobe ) and her two equally feisty hottie daughters - - the sexually precocious Billie Jean ( adorable blonde sprite Susan Sennett of " The Candy Snatchers " ) and dim-witted Polly ( pretty brunette cutie Robbie Lee of " Switchblade Sisters " ) - - embark on a wild'n'rowdy crime spree in 30's Depression-era America in order to escape hard times . Accompanying the lovely ladies are charming , but cowardly con man William J . Baxter ( the ever-hammy William Shatner sporting a hilariously hokey Southern accent ) and ill-tempered bank robber Fred Diller ( the hunky Tom Skerrit ) , who happily jump in the sack with the willing wanton women in between breaking many laws . Directed with tremendously rambunctious gusto by Steve ( " An Eye for An Eye " ) Carver , jam-packed with a pleasing plenitude of car chases , shoot outs , cuss words and tasty gratuitous nudity ( even Sally Kirkland as a local harlot and Joan Prather as a snotty heiress the gang abducts doff their duds and bare their beautiful bodies ) , further enlivened by a ceaseless forward-ho quick pace , a rousing hillbilly bluegrass score by David Grisman , a cheerfully irreverent tone , and nifty supporting turns by Royal Dano as a profanity-spewing preacher and the always terrific Dick Miller as huffy fed Bonney ( a sly homage to " Bonnie and Clyde , " methinks ) , " Big Bad Mama " supplies a handy helping of joyous down-home trashy entertainment that's a true treat to watch .
518903	8239592	129532	8.0	I can't get enough of these blithely stupid flicks !	Okay , I'll admit it . I'm a definite fan of the " Vice Academy " series . Granted , these films are cheap , cheesy and unapologetically low-brow trash that are utterly bereft of any artistic merit . And that's precisely why I dig ' em so much . One doesn't watch a " Vice Academy " feature looking for profound insights concerning the human condition . Instead you watch these flicks strictly for fun . And that's okay by me , man . Wicked insatiable green-haired nymphomaniac Malathian ( broadly essayed with unrestrained hammy panache by Julia Parton ) escapes from jail and goes on the rampage . Meanwhile the dippy Candy ( the ever-adorable Elizabeth Kaitan ) and eager Samantha ( likable Rebecca Rocheford ) help the persnickety Miss Thelma Louise Devonshire ( delightfully played to uptight perfect by Jayne Hamil ) with her upcoming marriage to the pompous police commissioner ( the hilarious Jay Richardson ) . Writer / director Rick Sloane pours on the cheerful idiocy with his usual shameless abandon ; this time we get suitably asinine jokes about such always uproarious subjects as electrocution , elderly strippers , and women beating up men . Steve Bigharat's bright cinematography makes this picture look more polished than previous entries . That awesomely cool-wailing theme song " Pistol Whipped " and Alan DerMardesian's hard-groovin ' score hit the funky bull's eye . The cast portray their parts with tremendous go-for-it enthusiasm : Kaitan and Rocheford display a pleasant chemistry , Steve Mateo is engaging as studly lunkhead mechanic Anvil , and Chad Gabbert nerds it up something dweeby as the commissioner's geeky sci-fi fan son Irwin . The disastrous climactic wedding ceremony rates as a genuine tour-de-force of classical farce at its most brilliant and sophisticated . Better yet , both Parton and Kaitan expose their exquisitely enormous breasts . All in all , it's another radiant comedic gem .
517998	8239592	366526	8.0	A worthy recent entry in the long-running series	Two tiny twin fairies advise wise old scientist Dr . Sinichi Chujo ( nicely played by Hiroshi Koizuma ) to stop the repairs on the severely damaged MechaGodzilla . Their warning goes unheeded . Godzilla wakes up in one of his usual grouchy moods and heads towards Japan with the specific intent of trashing Tokyo . Mothra comes to mankind's rescue , but proves to be no match for the Big G . It's ultimately up to MechaGodzilla to defeat the brutish behemoth . Director Masaaki Tezuka relates the story at a constant brisk pace , maintains a refreshingly serious tone throughout , and stages the plentiful exciting action sequences with rip-roaring flair ( the long and protracted mondo destructo monster fight scenes totally smoke ) . Better still , there's a mean'n'lean straightforward quality to the narrative , with very few lulls and a huge amount of wild'n'rousing action ( Mothra's newly born larvae even join in on the battle against Godzilla ! ) . The human characters are genuinely engaging and well acted , with especially winning performances by Noboru Kaneko as eager beaver young mechanic Yoshito Chujo , Miho Yoshioka as feisty pilot Azusa Kisaragi , Mitsuki Koga as the cocky Kyosuke Akiba , and Masami Nagasawa and Chihiro Otsuka as the adorable psychic singing twin fairies . Kudos are also in order for Michiru Oshima's stirring , majestic score , Yoshinori Sekiguchi's glossy widescreen cinematography , and Eiichi Asada's often stunning special effects ( Mothra in particular is a strikingly graceful and beautiful giant creature ) . An excellent movie .
519368	8239592	389475	8.0	A pleasant surprise	The drab tranquility of the sleepy little town of Rockville gets harshly thrown out of wack after four teens are viciously murdered . It's up to stalwart Sheriff Duncan ( a strikingly good portrayal by the usually lacking Joe Estevez ) and sincere , but rather inept Deputy Charlie Fisher ( the engagingly geeky Circus Szalewski ) , assisted by obsessively thorough Detective Amy Rogers ( well played by ravishing brunette Nicole Buehrer ) , to catch the culprit . The most probable suspect is a young lady who just escaped from a nearby asylum . The young lady is arrested , attempts to get away and is subsequently killed while making her attempt . But the seemingly simple cut and dried case is far from over or solved . In fact , it's just the opening of a whole can of worms which will change several people's lives forever . " The Rockville Slayer " rates as a most pleasant and unexpected surprise . For starters , it's a complex and involving mystery thriller instead of the mindless slasher horror flick its misleading title suggests . Moreover , the well-drawn characters are refreshingly real , flawed and recognizably human . Director Marc Selz , working from his own intricate and intriguing script , delivers a nice smattering of nudity and grisly violence , effectively creates a creepy and unnerving atmosphere , offers plenty of truly startling plot twists , and keeps the pace moving forward at a pleasingly speedy clip . The fine cast all contribute excellent performances , with especially nifty appearances by Linnea Quigley as a local harlot who went crazy and the ever-intimidating Robert Z'Dar as her brutish husband . Kudos are also in order for Joe Harris ' crisp , handsome cinematography and Karl Sundstrom's neatly spare'n'shivery synthesizer score . Overall , this baby qualifies as a real strong and satisfying unsung little sleeper .
518893	8239592	82107	8.0	A really fun martial arts action romp	Reformed criminal Bruce ( handsome , charismatic chopsocky film star Bruce Le ) decides to go straight and settle down with his girlfriend after he gets released from prison . The gang he used to work for kidnap the fetching young daughter of an American ambassador ( co-producer Dick Randall in a small role ) . Bruce goes trekking all over the world in search of the lady . Directors Le and Joseph Velasco ( the latter also wrote the cheerfully ridiculous script ) relate the lively and eventful narrative at a nonstop brisk pace , toss in a pleasing plenitude of tasty gratuitous female nudity and lurid soft-core sex , and cram this baby with more frantic knock-down , drag-out kung fu scuffles than you can shake a pair of nun-chucks at . Perenial Asian bad guy thespian Harold " Oddjob " Sakata portrays his usual nefarious lead heavy who this time sports a lethal steel claw hand while the ubiquitous Bolo Yeung once again essays his umpteenth flunky part . Randall's hot redhead wife Corliss pops up in a handful of scenes as a tough female detective ( she's billed under the choice pseudonym of Chick Norris ! ) . The glossy widescreen cinematography and exotic globe-trotting locations give this flick a nice sense of scope . Better still , the neatly eclectic film library score alternates between schmaltzy elevator music-style instrumental versions of popular hit tunes ( which include the famous James Bond theme ! ) and funky , syncopated , groovy-jammin ' discoid funk . The rousing and lengthy climactic confrontation between Bruce and erstwhile best buddy Ron ( wiry Wang Jang Lee ) likewise hits the stirring spot . Hugely entertaining trash .
518703	8239592	265870	8.0	A really amusing and entertaining Grade Z schlock camp hoot	Professor John Coleman ( nicely played by John Holland ) gets abducted by a group of evil Nazis . Coleman's decent , morally upright son-in-law Phil ( likable Walter Stocker ) and his sweet wife Kathy ( lovely Audrey Claire ) go to the South American country of Mandoras to save him . They discover the living disembodied head of none other than Adolph Hitler ( a hilariously manic portrayal by Bill Freed ) , who plans on taking over the world with a deadly nerve gas that only Professor Coleman knows the antidote to . David Bradley's competent direction maintains a steady pace throughout and effectively develops a colorful south-of-the-border atmosphere . The acting is generally solid , with especially stand-out turns by Nestor Paiva as polite , friendly , cigar-puffing police chief Alaniz and the delightful Dani Lynn as wacky slang-slinging beatnik hipster chick Suzanne . Film noir veteran Stanley Cortez's gorgeously sharp'n'slick cinematography gives the movie an attractive glossy look . The booming'n'bombastic stock library score is pretty funny . Ditto the priceless scene where a dead body falls out of a phone booth . Although a bit slow and talky , this notorious Grade Z schlock camp classic nonetheless radiates a certain cruddy charm that's both amusing and entertaining in equal measure . The BCI Eclipse DVD offers both the superior and more coherent original picture along with the extremely muddled and dreadful alternate version " They Saved Hitler's Brain . "
518794	8239592	66561	8.0	A really fun flick	The time : Sometime in the very distant ( nonexistent ) past . A tribe of evil primitive cave folks sacrifice gorgeous blonde women to the gods in order to be protected from lethal predatory dinosaurs . The lovely and feisty Sanna ( the remarkably shapely and beautiful Victoria Vetri , a delicious " Playboy " Playmate who looks totally smokin ' in her skimpy two piece fur bikini ) manages to escape from the evil tribe and joins a much nicer tribe where she meets and falls in love with the kind , noble Tara ( handsome hunk Robin Hawdon ) . When the moon appears on the horizon for the first time poor Sanna gets blamed for it and is subsequently banished from the tribe . Writer / director Val Guest treats the endearingly silly story with admirable seriousness and elicits sincere performances from the attractive cast . This immensely entertaining film offers a little something for everyone : we've got insanely hot cave babes clad in revealing outfits , cool and convincing stop-motion animation dinosaurs done by Dave Allen and Jim Danforth , muscular young men running about in loincloths , an attack by a carnivorous tree , Vetri playing with a cute baby dinosaur , men with spears fighting giant deadly reptiles , big killer crabs , fierce torrential storms , a wild beachside catfight , and , best of all , Vetri displaying her awesomely ample body in both a cave love scene and skinny-dipping sequence ( make sure to see the 100 minute full uncut version or else you'll miss this tasty latter stuff ) . Dick Bush's crisp cinematography delivers a few striking visuals while Mario Nascimbene's lush orchestral score hits the stirring spot . Patrick Allen glowers effectively as the brutish villain Khaku . The luscious Imogen Hassall also makes a strong impression as jealous brunette spitfire Ayak . A hugely enjoyable , if admittedly preposterous picture .
518795	8239592	110557	8.0	Harvey Keitel is the scariest villain ever in a 90's kiddie flick !	The plot for this family feature is pretty negligible ( an eminently insufferable should-be lovable'n'huggable little girl adopts a cuddly capuchin who's been trained to steal things as a pet and hides the little bugger from her disapproving parents ) , but fortunately this film does have one tremendous ace up its otherwise empty sleeve : the chimp's evil , sinister , glowering gypsy organ-grinder owner is played by none other than a hilariously miscast Harvey Keitel ! Sporting a mouth full of gleaming gold teeth , long , greasy , unwashed hair , an awful wardrobe of blindingly gaudy gypsy rags , gold chains hanging around his chest , a feeble attempt at a dense European accent that's betrayed by Harve's unmistakable Brooklyn rumble , and the same crazed'n'creepy aura that he brought to his sleazy street corner pimp role in " Taxi Driver , " the ever-manic Keitel acts with a savage intensity and gritty authenticity which seems alarmingly out of place in an alleged kiddie pic . One simply hasn't lived until witnessing the hair-raising moment in which Harvey blames the monkey for the recent loss of his latest girlfriend : " She even took my freakin ' food ! , " Keitel roars at the poor , cowering creature . " She hated you and your stinkin ' mess ! " Alas , at no point in the film does Harvey curse out the monkey at the top of his lungs while furiously masturbating . Moreover , this flick's cast and crew should send the mind of any devout trash cinema aficionado reeling : Ridley Scott ( ! ) was the executive producer , cinematographer Luciano Tovoli also shot Dario Argento's landmark giallo " Tenebre , " " Bad Georgia Road " director John Broderick co-produced , and the cast includes such " what the hell are they doing here ? " notables as Mimi Rogers , Christopher McDonald , and dependably gruff Abel Ferrara movie mainstay Victor Argo in one of his customary mob capo parts . And one last remark before I conclude this particular comment : I bet dollars-to-donuts that there's a whole generation of hopelessly messed-up six year old tykes who are currently experiencing marrow-freezing nightmares because of Harvey Keitel's frightening , fire-breathing , full-throttle histrionics in this film .
519243	8239592	71150	8.0	The devil made her do it	A bitter and sexually frustrated crippled young woman ( superbly played with absolutely fearless abandon by Carla Gravina ) renounces her faith in God . Since said lovely young lady was in a previous life a witch who got burned at the stake as a heretic 400 years ago , this makes it doubly easy for Satan to take possession of her body . ( The scene where Gravina gives herself to Lucifer is a total doozy : a blue-painted man wearing a ram's head mask forces her to eat a severed toad's head and Gravina gleefully copulates with a goat . ) Pretty soon Gravina is making unseemly incestuous advances on her brother , cruising the streets for young men to seduce , using foul language at the diner table , frothing at the mouth , and levitating around the house . Father Mel ( " Nightmare City " ) Ferror and stepmother Alida ( " Suspiria " ) Valli are understandably perturbed . It's up to bishop Arthur ( " Let Sleeping Corpses Lie " ) Kennedy and priest George ( " Tower of Evil " ) Coulouris to save Gravina's soul before it's too late . Capably directed by Alberto De Martino ( who also co-wrote the bold script ) , with sharp photography by notorious celluloid sleazemeister Joe D'Amato , a typically fine , haunting and stirring score by Ennio Morricone and Bruno Nicolai , a creepy , uneasy atmosphere , plenty of hilariously excessive profanity ( " You stinking pots of st ! " ) , some lovably chintzy optical effects , solid acting from a uniformly excellent cast , and a rousing climactic exorcism , this enjoyably trashy Italian exploitation horror outing really delivers the satisfyingly junky demonic possession goods .
519175	8239592	79803	8.0	An immensely enjoyable piece of chopsocky action junk	Shrewd , suave Chang Wong ( a solid and amiable performance by the handsome and charismatic Bruce Li ) and his redoubtable female partner ( superbly essayed with delicious vigor by the foxy Angela Mao ) devise an elaborate scheme to take out a heroin drug ring led by the nefarious Paul ( nicely played by the enormous Paul Smith of " Popeye " and " Dune " fame ) . Moreover , Chang also works for a rival dope-dealing organization in order to further stir things up . Director Jimmy Shaw crams this baby with a handy helping of hugely entertaining good stuff : wall-to-wall fierce and crazy martial arts fights , several groovy nightclub scenes ( the funky-chillin ' house band is simply amazing ! ) , a couple of brutal garrotings , inspired occasional use of strenuous slow motion , a nonstop speedy pace , a wild free-for-all confrontation between the two criminal factions , and a fantastic rousing climactic showdown between Li and Smith in which Li's graceful physical agility is pitted against Smith's fearsome brute strength . Chou Fu Liang's awesomely gnarly throbbing disco score hits the soulful spot . Chiou Yao-Hwu's reasonably polished cinematography likewise makes the grade . Best of all , the lovely Ms . Mao looks smoking hot in a sparkling silver jumpsuit and beats the living tar out of a teeming volume of guys . What's not to like about this totally fun vintage 70's grindhouse flick ?
518352	8239592	82000	8.0	The amazing exploding torso movie !	From Luigi Cozzi , the same dependably derivative dimestore cinema ace who blessed us with the marvelously mindless " Star Wars " copy " Starcrash , " comes this equally unoriginal , but still immensely enjoyable , often funny and excessively tacky Italian " ALIEN " cash-in . Severely demented'n'tormented German astronaut Siegfried Rauch brings back from Mars a gaggle of noisy , sticky , glowing bright green watermelon-sized eggs which are stored in a Columbian warehouse and smuggled into America ( they're disguised as prime coffee beans ! ) on a rusty freighter . Said evil eggs spew forth a foul , viscous , deadly liquid that makes folks explode something disgusting ; their torsos blow out and their guts erupt all over the place in a most wonderfully repulsive way . Naturally , the whole thing's a pernicious plot to wipe out the human race and make our planet more open to being colonized by your typically malevolent invading horde of conquer-happy extraterrestrials . The telepathic , slime-covered , preposterously hokey-looking wicked ET cyclops leader will make you laugh so hard that you might very well dry out your tear ducts . Ian McCulloch , that singularly charmless and nondescript British bore who saved the day in both Lucio Fulci's potently visceral spaghetti splatter milestone " Zombie " and the splendidly sordid'n'slipshod grindhouse nugget " Dr . Butcher , M . D . , " plays yet another insipid hero with his trademark bland , humorless , stiff-upper-lip solemnity , therefor making it easier for the more sociopathic viewers out there to cheer for the aliens with a clear conscience . Perfectly topped off by priceless dippy dialogue , dreadful acting , even worse dubbing , plentiful juicy gore , and a first-rate raw , throbbing , rough-grooving score by Goblin , this tasty piece of sci-fi / horror trash provides a great deal of infectiously schlocky fun .
519382	8239592	958826	8.0	Marvelously messed-up monkey movie madness	Representing good'n'gross nickel'n'dime exploitation horror sludge at its most feverishly enthusiastic and righteously offensive , Keith Crocker's deliciously scurrilous indie effort " The Bloody Ape " stands out as a terrifically trashy serving of top-rate tacky fun that's loosely based on Edgar Allen Poe's seminal short story " Murders in the Rue Morgue . " Eccentric vengeful carnival barker Lampini ( a delightfully hammy performance by Paul Richichi ) trains his 7-foot , 300 lb sideshow gorilla Gorto to kill all his enemies . Gorto gets loose and proceeds to wreak some major league mondo disgusto blood-spilling , gut-slinging , head-crushing , limb-rending , heavy on the puke-inducing splatter havoc : a hippie hitchhiker gets brutally castrated in a simply smashing scene that pays lovely homage to the infamous Bigfoot gore gem " Night of the Demon , " a naked chick taking a shower gets mangled , the ape rapes two nude women , a jerky cop has his head torn off , the savage simian beats a lady up and steals her car ( you'll hit the floor with hysterics when you see the ape recklessly driving the freshly stolen automobile down the street ) , and generally behaves in a highly vicious , psychotic and anti-social manner that's more befitting of your average garden variety sociopathic serial killer . And , just to spice things up a wee bit more , despicable racist slime homicide detective Lieutenant LoBianco ( robustly played to the hateful hilt by George Reis , who also portrays Gorto ) blames the killings on a luckless innocent black man ( the affable Chris Hoskins ) . Although a bit slow and talky during its first 10-odd minutes and further marred by one of those annoyingly inconclusive " it ain't over yet ! " - style sequel set-up endings , " The Bloody Ape " overall still does a splendidly scuzzy job of paying tribute to all those gleefully obnoxious fright flick gruefests of yore by delivering a tasty truckload of all the right seedy schlock movie stuff : we've got gratuitous female nudity galore , plenty of witty , knowing 70's movie and TV show references sprinkled in the often furiously raw and profane dialogue , a rich rogues ' gallery of superbly scummy supporting characters , a very agreeable no-nonsense , let's get right down to business attitude that's thankfully bereft of the smugly ironic , " I know more than you know " arrogant sensibility which undermines most fanboy affairs , grainy , rough-around-the-edges , but still quite polished and mobile cinematography ( besides some choice cheesy solarization , we also get some decent tracking shots and a little nifty hand-held camera-work towards the end of the flick ) , a veritable sea of messy , juicy , lowdown repulsive gore , a cockeyed view of the world which depicts humans as largely base , evil , horrible folks who enjoy doing crummy things to each other and subsequently gives the rampaging gorilla the oddly sympathetic aura of a mixed-up anti-hero , and , most importantly , an ever-present sense of very dedicated , eager and aiming to please affection for cheerfully lowbrow grindhouse cinema which proves to be quite engaging and extremely entertaining in equal measure . Directed with infectious gonzo zeal by Keith Crocker , who collaborated with George Reis on the script , photography , producing and editing ( the film took five whole years to complete ) , " The Bloody Ape " rates as a gloriously grody testament to fiercely self-reliant Do-It-Yourself underground cinema at its most beautifully bent , batty and berserk . By the way , I'm featured in the retrospective " making of " documentary that's a nifty extra on the excellent special edition DVD as a " trash film historian " under my real name of Joe Wawrzyniak ; just do your best to ignore my wildly gesticulating hands at the bottom of the frame as I happily discuss both this movie and the other flicks that influenced it .
519254	8239592	86340	8.0	An enjoyably inane piece of early 80's sword and sorcery trash	Busty'n'lusty medieval twins Mira ( Leigh Harris ) and Mara ( Lynette Harris ) vow to seek revenge on the evil sorcerer Traigon ( a constantly snarling Roberto Ballestros ) for both murdering their mother and attempting to kill them when they were little girls . Assisting the lovely ladies are horny barbarian Erlick ( hunky Bob Nelson ) and portly warrior Baldar ( chubby wonder Bruno Key ) . Said mission is naturally easier said than done because Traigon has many tricks up his sleeve and is obsessed with sacrificing one of the beautiful'n'bountiful babes so he can become powerful enough to rule the world . Director Jack Hill , working from a blithely dopey script co-written by Jim Wynorski , loads this laughably tacky sword and sorcery fantasy romp with all the necessary ingredients to make it a so-dumb-it's-fun high camp howler : a constant fast pace , gut-bustingly bad dialogue ( favorite line : " Death is only death , swine ! " ) , hokey ( far from ) special effects , terrible acting from a lame no-name cast , an outrageously overwrought conclusion , a few nifty monsters ( I especially dug the satyr which nays like a goat and the winged lion ) , and , of course , a decent smattering of gratuitous distaff nudity courtesy of the absolutely delectable Harris sisters . As an added bonus , we even get a thrilling score from future Oscar-winning A-list composer James ( " Titanic " ) Horner and a last reel appearance by an army of zombie swordsmen . Sure , this flick is goofy junk , but it's still quite entertainingly silly schlock just the same .
518413	8239592	174360	8.0	An amateurish , but very enthusiastic and hence hugely enjoyable piece of low budget zombie horror splatter trash	A meltdown at a nuclear power plant causes a majority of people to turn into lethal , rot-faced , shambling zombies who naturally go on a grisly rampage . A ragtag handful of uninfected folks do their best to survive this grueling ordeal . Director / co-writer / producer Todd Sheets displays an appealingly sincere love and passion for go-straight-for-the-throat lively and gruesome horror fare : he maintains an unflagging snappy pace throughout , fills the screen with wall-to-wall crazy action , and thankfully keeps the terrible dialogue to a pleasing minimum . Moreover , Sheets certainly doesn't skimp on the gloriously graphic and excessive over-the-top splatter : this picture delivers a tasty truckload of flesh melting , evisceration , lots of gut munching , one dude has his heart yanked out , and there's even a nice impalement on a tree branch . Sheets earns bonus points for keeping the tone grim and nasty to the literal bitter end ( for example , almost all of the main characters wind up becoming zombie chow ) . Granted , this flick has its fair share of flaws : the ragged editing , several ham-fisted attempts at pathos , and the largely awful acting from a rank no-name cast all leave a good deal to be desired . Top thespic honors go to the pretty and perky Kasey Rausch for her winningly spunky portrayal of the resourceful Daria Trumillio . Frank Dunlay likewise does well as rugged take-charge army veteran Ralph Walsh . Best of all , Sheets ' sure grasp of an infectiously slambang sense of unrelenting headlong momentum and obvious affinity for the horror genre ensure that this remains a total blast to watch from start to finish .
517899	8239592	94929	8.0	Gross , creepy and underrated	A sterling example of how a threadbare and unpromising premise can be made genuinely creepy and effective thanks to a proficient execution . Granted , the story ain't much : Young fellow Clark ( affable J . Eddie Peck ) and his sweet girlfriend Lisa ( a winning performance by late 80's flash-in-the-pan scream queen cutie Jill Schoelen of " The Stepfather " fame ) are driving their jeep across the parched , desolate Arizona desert . The pair take an ill-advised detour off the main road and discover an old abandoned nuclear test site . Things turn sour when one of the jeep tires goes flat . Things get worse when Clark gets bitten by a radioactive snake . And , naturally , things become all the more hairy and freaky when Clark's bitten arm starts to mutate into a foul , icky , highly deadly and disgusting snake monster ! As I said before , the hackneyed plot leaves plenty to be desired . However , with this supremely yucky and revolting horror movie gross-out splatterfest it's not the story that counts ; it's Screaming Mad George's astonishingly vile and revolting make-up f / x and Federico Prosperi's commendably able direction which really make the difference here . Among the picture's sickening highlights are a woman's jaw being torn off , a man's heart being yanked out of his throat , and Peck vomiting forth dozens of steaming slithery snakes . The acting is uniformly tops as well : Peck and Schoelen are credible and likable leads , with solid support from Bo Svenson as a mean , intimidating jerk sheriff , Jamie Farr as a friendly , helpful salesman , " Midnight Ride " ' s Savina Gersak as a kind , pious Baptist lady , Sydney Lassick as a meek , squeamish motel clerk , and " Parasite " ' s Al Fann as a belligerent gas station attendant . Roberto D'Ettorre Piazoli's crisp , fluid cinematography , the eerily forbidding atmosphere , Carlo Maria Cordio's spare , shivery score , the superbly spooky use of arid , swelteringly hot and sticky New Mexico locations , and the spectacularly grotesque and hence immensely upsetting bummer ending further enhance the overall flesh-crawling uneasiness of this harrowingly unpleasant and unnerving fright film surprise .
518137	8239592	86129	8.0	A worthy follow-up to the excellent original	Director / co-screenwriter Bob Clark follows up his surprise hit original with this solid and often sidesplitting sequel . This time those rowdy lads at Angel Beach High are pitted against a bunch of uptight killjoy religious fanatics led by the smarmy Reverand Flaval ( a perfectly slimy Bill Wiley ) who object to a Shakespeare festival on the grounds that the Bard's work is obscene . Moreover , the local Klu Klux Klan aren't happy that Native American John Henry ( likable James Runningfox ) is playing the lead in the production of " Romeo and Juliet . " Clark not only incorporates the expected wild'n'raunchy anything-goes humor that was a key pleasing ingredient of the first film , but also takes wickedly nasty satiric potshots at such deserving targets as racial prejudice , religious hypocrisy and political corruption . Once again the cast really sink their teeth into their parts with unbridled gusto . Special kudos are in order for Dan Monahan as the impish Pee Wee , Kaki Hunter as the cheerfully bawdy Wendy , Nancy Parsons as stern gym teacher Ms . Balbricker , and Eric Christmas as the timid Principal Carter . Comic highlights include a nice tongue-in-cheek homage to Clark's earlier fright feature " Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things , " Ms . Balbricker singing on the toilet , and Wendy acting like a loud obnoxious ill-mannered immature brat at a posh French restaurant . Cisse Cameron has a memorably sexy bit as a luscious stripper who disrobes in a cemetery . Reginald H . Morris ' slick cinematography , Carl Zittrer's lively , rousing score , and the catchy golden oldies soundtrack are all likewise up to par . There's even a surprising amount of sweet sensitivity to be found amid all the wacky tomfoolery . Granted , this film doesn't totally match the gut-busting hilarity of the incredible original , but it's still plenty of good , naughty fun all the same .
519443	8239592	70828	8.0	A taut and gripping 70's made-for-TV thriller	Businessman Chuck Brenner ( a strong and engaging performance by James Brolin ) gets mugged and knocked unconscious in the bathroom at a department store . When Chuck comes to , he finds himself locked inside the store with a bunch of ferocious Doberman guard dogs . Writer / director Frank De Felitta , who also wrote the superior supernatural shocker " The Entity , " relates the arresting story at a snappy pace and does an adept job of creating plenty of sweaty , nerve-wracking suspense . Fred Mandl's agile cinematography and Gil Melle's primal , robust , throbbing score greatly enhance the white-knuckle tension . Brolin excels in the strenuous and demanding lead role : Scared and delirious , suffering from severe blood loss ( one of the vicious canines bites his leg ) and fending off those pesky pooches with either a chair or a flaming mop , Brolin has you rooting for him every harrowing step of the way . Moreover , the supporting cast likewise contributes solid work : Susan Clark as Chuck's bitter estranged ex-wife Elaine , Earl Holliman as Elaine's patient , practical new hubby David Moore , Robert ( " Trouble Man " ) Hooks as smooth , helpful police Sergeant Connaught , and Tammy Harrington as Chuck's adorable little daughter Carrie . An excellent nail-biter .
518612	8239592	93315	8.0	An enjoyably dopey mid 80's Crown International Pictures teen comedy romp	Amiable college varsity Coach Chip Williams ( the always solid Richard Roundtree of " Shaft " fame ) has to whip his wacky team of misfit players into shape for a major regional tournament being held in Las Vegas . Said wacky misfits include charming stud muffin on wheels the Kid ( hunky Scott Strader ) , affable mellow dude Jeff ( cute Perry Lang ) , raucous wildman Ripper ( the incredible Donald Gibb ; Ogre from " Revenge of the Nerds " ) , and excitable Mexican Chito ( the hilarious Trinidad Silva ) . But these nutty guys are more interested in having fun than winning a big game . Capably directed with infectiously easy'n'breezy panache by Steve Carver , with bright , sunny cinematography by Adam Greenberg , lots of cool-jammin ' songs on the bouncy soundtrack , an endearingly sweet'n'silly tone , engaging acting from the likable and attractive young leads , a groovy , hard-rockin ' score by David McHugh , cheap gay jokes , a priceless sequence in a sleazy biker bar , a nice smattering of gratuitous nudity , and several thrilling tennis games , this flick overall rates as an entertainingly lightweight diversion . The eclectic supporting cast qualifies as a substantial plus : future " Law & Order : Special Victims Unit " TV series regular Mariska Hargitay as adorable tennis groupie Nicole , Christopher Lee as pompous killjoy college President White , R . G . Armstrong as bumbling , sycophantic athletic director Coach Bettleborn , and future mainstream movie director Tom ( " Liar , Liar , " " Bruce Almighty " ) Shadyac as arrogant rival tennis champ Chris . Good , goofy fun .
518760	8239592	1080981	8.0	An interesting and informative documentary on Edie Sedgwick	This short , but compelling and illuminating documentary interviews a handful of people who knew Edie Sedgwick during her fleeting , but eventful and memorable burst of fame in the 60's . Among the folks interviewed are Edie's supportive brother Jonathan , her loyal friend Richie Berlin , photographer Nat Finkelstein , art gallery curator Sam Green , record producer Danny Fields , fashion designer Betsey Johnson , artist Gerard Malanga , and " Factory Girl " writer / director George Hickenlooper . We learn that Sedgwick hailed from a wealthy , yet disturbed family ( two of her brothers committed suicide and her father might have had an incestuous relationship with her ) , had been institutionalized in sanitariums several times as a little girl , craved both fame and attention in order to compensate for the love she didn't receive as a kid , Andy Warhol basically used her as a means to an end to make himself a celebrity ( although Warhol essentially invented post-modernism , Edie was nonetheless instrumental in his success ) , had her own singular style , glamorous persona and sense of irresistible charisma that made her an automatic star ( she was also a terrific uninhibited dancer to boot ) , and her romance with Bob Dylan caused her relationship with Warhol to fall apart . Edie's subsequent disintegration beget by her drug addiction is frankly addressed . As one interviewee notes , one of Edie Sedgwick's fatal flaws was that she was a frail and vulnerable damaged soul who never asked anyone for help . A poignant and sobering portrait of the original 60's It girl who was quite possibly the first performance artist of her time .
517914	8239592	147310	8.0	A perfectly foul , harsh and disgusting Nazisploitation flick	All kinds of horrible stuff happens to the luckless lady prisoners at SS Camp 5 . Their fierce and sadistic Nazi captors either force the women to become prostitutes so they can sexually service Nazi officers and boost morale or use them as guinea pigs for barbaric scientific experiments . Director / co-writer Sergio Garrone certainly doesn't skimp on the leering low-grade sleaze : we've got plentiful gratuitous distaff nudity , two group shower scenes , an orgy , a few sordid soft-core sex scenes , and one very nasty rape . Moreover , Garrone delivers the raw , ugly and sickening brutality by the nauseating bucketful : Among the hideous sights on display are four would-be escapees being torched in an oven , various poor ladies having their legs set on fire , one gal has her head crushed in a vice , another gets repeatedly punched in the stomach with sharp brass knuckles , a third lass has flaming bamboo sticks placed under her fingernails ( ouch ! ) , and a fourth woman has her tongue torn out with a huge pair of tongs . This thoroughly fetid flick further benefits from the sound acting by a capable cast , with especially stand-out turns by foxy Pam Grier lookalike Rita Manna as feisty Jamaican Alina , Giorgio Cerioni as the humane Colonel Strasser , Serafino Profuma as cruel commandant Lt . Hans , Paola Corazzi as fetching blonde Edith , Patrizia Melegna as mean Nazi bitch Greta , Paola D'Egidio as the gutsy Deborah , Attilio Dottesio as quack scientist Dr . Abraham , and Paola Lelio as homely fat whorehouse madam Magda . Maurizio Centini's plain cinematography , the moody , melancholy , flesh-crawling synthesizer score by Vasili Kojucharov and Roberto Pregadio , and the grim , despairing tone all greatly add to the overall considerable sliminess and mean-spiritedness of this choice sick Italian Nazisploitation trash .
518167	8239592	870159	8.0	A charming little documentary	Actress Stella Stevens , looking as lovely and vibrant as ever , candidly talks about portraying whore with a heart of gold Hildy in " The Ballad of Cable Hogue . " Stevens points out that the film was at heart a tragic love story , that star Jason Robards was a perfect gentleman , the vocal for the duet " Butterfly Mornings " was recorded a capella in a single take , and praises executive producer Phil Feldman for having the guts to stand up to director Sam Peckinpah . Moreover , Stevens doesn't pull any punches concerning Peckinpah : she relates that Bloody Sam lacked tact and maybe even common sense , how his hostile temperament made things difficult for everyone on the set , and reveals that Peckinpah was of short stature and dressed more like a cowboy than a director , plus he always wore his trademark mirror sunglasses to hide the fact that he was a constant lier . In addition , Stella discusses starting her career as a model and confesses that she prefers comedy over drama . Well worth a watch for both Stella Stevens fans and aficionados of " The Ballad of Cable Hogue " alike .
519090	8239592	72400	8.0	A very strong and absorbing 70's made-for-TV end-of-the-world science fiction winner	This solid 70's end-of-the-world made-for-TV picture has a few striking similarities to William Girdler's " Day of the Animals . " Like that sturdy nature-gone-amok killer animal flick this feature amounts to a very effective and genuinely eerie effort . Stalwart , resolute father Peter Graves , his bookish chip off the old block science nerd son George O ' Hanlon , Jr . , and antsy daughter Kathleen Quinlan are camping in the High Sierras when a solar flair explosion occurs . The explosion wipes out most of mankind , leaving only a scattered minute handful of people left . Graves and his kids make a perilous trek to Malibu , California . They pick up dazed , shell-shocked , grief-stricken mother Verna Bloom and gutsy little boy Michael James Wixted , have their car stolen by a panicky guy , and fend off packs of vicious wild dogs along the way . John Llewellyn ( " The Night Stalker " ) Moxey's spare , no-frills direction lets the starkly plotted story unfold in a creepily gradual and unforced manner , eschewing any potentially credibility-killing flashy pyrotechnics in favor of a lean , stripped-down style that deftly creates and sustains a certain gritty plausibility . This in turn gives the film a quietly unsettling power that remains taut and absorbing to the very end . The convincing , laudably restrained performances by a fine cast , the tightly wound script by John Lewis ( " The Mechanic " ) Carlino and Sandor ( " Shark Kill " ) Stern , the plain , unadorned cinematography , the minimal , unobtrusive score , and an uncompromisingly downbeat ending that's capped off by a delicately optimistic conclusion all add considerable substance to this gently moving paean to the essential human need to survive and keep living .
518632	8239592	68364	8.0	A choice cheesy chunk of vintage 70's soft-core drive-in exploitation camp trash	The film that got the whole 70's drive-in exploitation soft-core cheerleader comedy genre ball rolling - - and boy what an endearingly dippy start ! The plot , such as it is , revolves around the five highly active and naughty cheerleader squad members of Amorosa High School in California who help a sweet virginal sixth new member get her cherry popped . ( Interestingly enough , a majority of 70's cheerleader pictures take place in California , thereby suggesting that the Golden State was a veritable hotbed of blithely brash'n'brazen anything-goes hedonistic activity . ) As usual , it's not the story that really counts ; what makes this blissfully braindead affair so worthwhile are the following things : A ) a nonstop barrage of eye-popping gratuitous nudity , B ) an incessantly lewd'n'crude sense of humor ( I loved the toe sucking gag ) , C ) tirelessly moronic dialogue ( " You look like a hag from the rag bag " ) , and D ) an upbeat , spirited , lighthearted air that ensures that this inane beaut is a quick , peppy and most satisfying diversion . Stephanie Fondue , Denise Dillaway , Jovita Bush , Sandy Evans , Brandy Woods and Kim Stanton are all quite cute , shapely , sexy and appealing as our titular hot young honeys - - and they happily doff their duds a lot , too . The sex scenes happen at regular intervals of roughly ten minutes and take place in an amusing assortment of unlikely places : a car wash , a fast food joint , the driver's seat of a moving school bus ( ! ) , even on somebody's front lawn . The technical credits are strictly so-so : the acting is generally flat and dreadful ( top thespic honors go to Patrick Wright for his deliciously hammy turn as the lecherous macho dude football coach ) , plus both Paul Glicker's adequate direction and Richard Lerner's basic , scratchy cinematography ( the constant use of wipes and freeze frames is lovably primitive ) are merely passable at best . However , David Herman comes through loud and clear with an infectiously zippy score which alternates between eardrum-splitting fuzztone-drenched acid rock and zesty bubblegum pop slop ( the too-goofy-for-words catchy theme song " I Like What You're Doing to Me " won't get out of your head for a week ) . Too cheerfully dopey to hate , " The Cheerleaders " rates as a very agreeable and enjoyable beginning for the admittedly slight , but always entertaining 70's cheerleader movie sub-genre .
518926	8239592	72260	8.0	A choice trashy chunk of 70's Crown International drive-in junk	Shy , awkward , virginal 18-year-old Sean Roberts ( an engaging performance by Jay North of TV's " Dennis the Menace " fame ) becomes involved with sexy , enticing , aggressive 28-year-old teacher Diane Marshall ( gorgeous blonde babe Angel Tompkins ) . The couple are relentlessly terrorized by deranged Vietnam veteran psycho stalker Ralph ( a typically creepy and intense portrayal by perennial bad guy thespian Anthony James ) , who blames Sean for the accidental death of his brother Lou . Writer / director / producer Hikmet Avedis offers an enjoyably tawdry brew of sizzling soft-core sex , grimy violence and scrumptious gratuitous nudity in this mostly lightweight and playful drive-in diversion . Nice supporting turns by Ned Flory as Sean's cranky dad Joe , Marlene Schmidt as Sean's sweet mom Alice , and Barry Atwater ( the ferocious rampaging vampire in the classic made-for-TV horror gem " The Night Stalker " ) as the amiable Sheriff Murphy . John Cassavetes ' mother Katherine and Gena Rowlands ' mother Lady make an amusing appearance as a pair of snippy old gossiping biddies at a posh restaurant . Alfred Taylor's competent cinematography , the hilariously mawkish cocktail lounge ballad theme song , Tompkins ' pleasingly frequent mouth-watering nude scenes , Shorty Rogers ' funky , syncopated score , and the startlingly downbeat conclusion add substantially to the overall trashy fun .
518121	8239592	93654	8.0	An excellent , exciting and underrated 80's action thriller sleeper	Amy Madigan is one of my all-time favorite unsung actresses : She's pretty in a modest , corn-fed sort of way , has one of those dry , throaty , worn-out alto voices which I personally find to be very sultry , and her often short , faded blonde hair ain't nothing to sneeze about , either . Furthermore , Amy also possesses a forceful , dynamic , wholly arresting screen presence , a goodly amount of fortitude , and has flair to spare . In short , Amy's my kind of girl , a gutsy , brassy and even sexy little spitfire who rarely ( if ever ) is given the full credit and attention she deserves . Fortunately , this bang-up action thriller features the terrific Ms . Madigan in peak plucky'n'punchy form as Barbara Cutter , the tough , but tender wife of marine helicopter pilot Rob ( winningly played by Daniel Hugh Kelly ) . Rob discovers that faulty helicopter parts have caused two fatal chopper " accidents . " Rob gets rubbed out by a pair of deadly thugs ( one is nicely essayed by great , prolific , underrated fat guy character actor Maury Chaykin ) who are in the employ of a ruthless , penny-pinching , cornering-cutting evil general ( a perfectly detestable John Colicos ; Balter on " Battlestar Galactica " ) who in turn is in cahoots with a bunch of illegal black market whirlybird thieves . Barbara and her son Johnny ( a surprisingly strong and tolerable turn by child actor Robin MacEachern ) , the latter of whom has some incriminating evidence of the below-par helicopters hidden in his toy robot ( ! ) , survive the hit and hightail it into the woods , seeking refuge and protection from Rob's reclusive , tight-lipped Vietnam veteran survivalist buddy Ben ( the always outstanding Michael Ironside ) . This surprisingly involving and exciting action thriller pip benefits substantially from Mario Azzopardi's proficient and energetic direction , a constant snappy pace , exceptionally stirring and well-staged action sequences ( Barbara's climactic showdown with Colicos is especially rousing ) , top-notch acting from a sound cast , and a zesty , hard-driving score by the tireless Brad ( " Just Before Dawn , " " Fright Night " ) Fiedel . However , the glorious Amy Madigan clearly dominates - - scratch that , completely owns - - this film : Her gritty , explosive and thoroughly sympathetic portrayal of a courageous , take-charge , no-nonsense action heroine really hits the socko spot and makes this movie worth seeing for her superlative performance alone .
517954	8239592	63330	8.0	A hugely enjoyable early 60's Mexican horror flick	Four archaeologists take a sacred idol from a holy temple . Evil and powerful voodoo priest Zandor ( robustly played by Quintin Bulnes ) puts a curse on the four men and their loved ones . The guys are stalked and killed by lethal dolls armed with sharp poison needles . Director Benito Alazraki maintains a brisk pace throughout , elicits spirited acting from a fine cast ( the lovely Elvira Quintana is especially good as occult expert Karina ) , and expertly creates a supremely spooky atmosphere . Enrique Wallace's stark , grainy cinematography and the brooding score further enhance the overall creepy mood . But it's the film's ruthless open season on everybody grimly serious tone that gives this picture an additional eerie and unnerving edge ( the doll autopsy scene in particular is a definite ghoulish highlight ) . The doll people , portrayed by midgets in macabre masks with their victims ' faces on them , are truly freaky and unsettling creatures . Zandor's hulking rot-faced zombie servant is likewise really cool and grotesque . The sequences in Zandor's underground lair totally smoke . A fun and worthwhile fright feature .
518658	8239592	78240	9.0	The greatest horror-Western ever made	Arkansas , circa 1865 : After losing the final battle of the Civil War , sexist , sadistic Conferate commander Wishbone Cutter ( a gruff , intimidating , but fairly restrained turn by the often overly hammy Joe Don Baker , here giving one of his better , less blustery and bombastic performances ) , faithful half-Irish , half-Native American companion Moon ( beautifully essayed by Joy Houck , Jr . , a good , engaging actor who usually toiled away in forgettable junk unworthy of his talent ) , and laid-back geologist Amos " Teach " Raymond ( affable Ted Neeley , who played God's only son in " Jesus Christ , Superstar " ) venture into the dense , remote , uninviting Arkansas wilderness to unearth a diamond stash located on a sacred Indian mountain that's rumored to be guarded by territorial demons . Along the way the motley threesome pick up the comely , beguiling Drucilla Wilcox ( the mesmerizingly winsome'n'willowy Sondra Locke , whose pale , haunted , crystal-clear blue eyes are vaguely redolent of Meg Foster's otherworldly orbs ) , the lone shell-shocked survivor of a brutal Indian attack . Pretty soon the quartet is being terrorized by some mysterious assailant ( s ) . Could they be a strange tribe of inhospitable Apaches ? Or is it the lethal woodland spirit Chikara , who rules over hawks and doesn't take kindly to interlopers trespassing on its terrain ? Writer / director Earl E . Smith , who wrote both " The Legend of Boggy Creek " and " The Town That Dreaded Sundown " for Charles B . Pierce , does a superlative job of keeping the viewer on edge , adeptly creating a spooky , yet somehow oddly plausible and flavorful period tone which slowly , but surely grows on the viewer as the film gradually , carefully , and skillfully reaches its genuinely chilling and startling conclusion . The top-notch acting greatly contributes to the film's overall gritty credibility , with particularly nifty bits by the ever-scummy and unnerving unsung Western supporting villain John Davis Chandler as a repulsive backwoods psycho , Dennis Fimple as a grizzled , cloddish fur trapper who refers to the forest spirits as " haints , " and the magnificent Slim Pickens in a lovely , touching cameo as Virgil Cane , a sweet old-timer who's fatally wounded early in the picture and tells Cutter about the cache of diamonds right before he dies . The rousing , ferociously rough and pulverizing opening battle sequence starts the film on a stirring and striking note , with excellent , poignant use being made of the Band's terrific , tearful ballad " The Night They Drove Ol ' Dixie Down . " There's also some surprisingly vicious violence that one doesn't always see in a PG rated flick ( e . g . , the scene where Cutter removes an arrow from Raymond's arm is especially painful ) and plenty of supremely creepy skin-crawling enigmatic " what's really going on here ? " atmosphere . Quirky , low-key , and above all refreshingly different and original , " The Shadow of Chikara " is undoubtedly the finest , scariest and most exceptionally well-crafted horror-Western to ever grace celluloid . It's an unjustly forgotten little jewel of a sleeper that's well worth the extra effort to dig up and check out .
519359	8239592	91209	9.0	An edgy and intense 80's " danger on the road " nail-biter	Sweet , naive , wet behind the ears young guy Jim Halsey ( an unexpectedly strong C . Thomas Howell , whose callow boyishness and soft passivity for once work in his favor ) is driving a friend's car from Chicago , Illinois to San Diego , California through a lonely stretch of dusty and desolate Texas backroads . Jim makes the grave mistake of giving a ride to mysterious psychotic hitchhiker John Ryder ( an impeccably icy performance by a frightfully remote and intense Rutger Hauer , who's never been more serenely chilling than he is here ) , a calmly malevolent itinerant serial killer whose attempt at adding Halsey to his ever-growing number of victims gets foiled when Halsey forcefully ejects him from his speeding car . But Ryder hasn't finished with the hapless , cowering lad . Pretty soon poor Jim has been incriminated in a series of gruesome murders that were committed by Ryder , who obviously wants the boy to overcome his wimpiness and work up the necessary guts to take him out for reasons which are hinted at , but never completely explained ( subconcious guilt ? seething repressed homosexual lust ? a desire to call it quits and have someone else assume the role you played in life ? The possibilities are endless ) . Naturally , the cops are useless and only token nice gal waitress Jennifer Jason Leigh tries to help out , but winds up meeting an especially nasty end . Director Robert Harmon milks the harsh , upsetting and nihilistic implications of Eric Red's slyly open-ended and allegorical script for all they're worth , creating a potently tense , brooding , oddly surreal nightmarish atmosphere that's both engrossingly twisted and deliciously oblique , staging several breathtaking car chases with consummate skill ( extra props are in order here for John Seale's stunning cinematography and Mark Isham's moody , low-key score ) , never holding back on the unsparingly gruesome violence ( watch out for the infamous severed-fingers-in - - the-French-fries scene ! ) , and slowly , but surely erasing the fine line between good and evil , right and wrong , decency and indecency , even purity and wickedness as the film races towards its shatteringly vague conclusion which refuses to firmly state whether Halsey has either been irredeemably corrupted or considerably strengthened by his hair-raising , soul-crushing , will-testing brush with death . An absolute powerhouse .
518564	8239592	66418	9.0	The first and best of the 70's nurse movies	Four lovely young nurses in their last year of nursing school experience all kinds of turmoil and excitement in their lives : sweet Susan ( winsome brunette Elaine Giftos ) tries to comfort the bitter , terminally ill Greg ( a moving performance by Darrell Larson ) , eager , but neurotic Phred ( lovely blonde Karen Carlson ) romances handsome gynecologist Jim Caspar ( affable Lawrence Casey ) , free-spirited hippie Priscilla ( the stunningly gorgeous Barbara Leigh ) gets impregnated by laid-back drug dealer Les ( the solid Richard Rust ) , and compassionate Lynn ( nicely played by Brioni Farrell ) helps out angry Mexican revolutionary Victor Charlie ( the excellent Reni Santoni ) . Despite the fact that this film was made for Roger Corman's legendary exploitation outfit New World Pictures , it's anything but your standard mindless piece of leering soft-core schlock . Instead , it's a very pleasant , charming and even often thoughtful time capsule of the social and political upheavals of the groovy early 70's ( the subplot involving Lynn and the revolutionaries is especially potent and provocative ) . Special kudos are in order for director Stephanie Rothman , who brings a welcome and refreshing intelligence and sensitivity to the material . Moreover , the four attractive and appealing female leads all turn in sound and praiseworthy work . Scottie MacGregor likewise impresses as wise supervisor Ms . Boswell and ubiquitous 70's trailer voice guy Ronald Gans supplies the off-screen voice of a psychiatrist . Stevan Larner's polished cinematography , the fantastic rock soundtrack , and the flavorsome folksy'n'funky score by Clancy B . Grass III are all up to speed . A real sleeper .
519177	8239592	95312	9.0	Quite simply one of the greatest pieces of blithely sleazy junk to ever ooze its way onto celluloid	Low-rent private eye Jack Chandler ( nicely played to the scuzzy hilt by Jay Richardson ) runs afoul of a deadly cult of crazed chainsaw-worshiping hookers while searching around Los Angeles for runaway teen Samantha ( the ever-adorable Linnea Quigley in peak perky form ) . Director Fred Olen Ray , who also co-wrote the witty tongue-in-cheek script with frequent collaborator T . L . Lankford , whips up one doozy of a hilariously campy horror splatter trash hoot that pokes merry fun at both vintage 40's film noir detective yarns and choice cheerfully cheap'n'cruddy drive-in fare alike . Gunnar Hansen makes for a suitably mysterious and menacing villain as the evil cult leader . Better still , this flick sure doesn't skimp on the tasty plentiful female nudity : the luscious Michelle Bauer performs a sizzling full frontal striptease prior to carving some hapless guy up with a chainsaw , Quigley dances topless in a seedy dive bar ( Linnea's legendary scorching Virgin Dance of the Double Chainsaws likewise seriously smokes ) , Esther Elise poses nude for some racy photos , and Tricia Burns bares her breasts . Scott Andrew Ressler's rough , grainy cinematography further enhances the movie's considerable grungy charm . The groovy retro 50's-style rock soundtrack , Michael Perilsten's cool rollicking score , and the endearingly tacky gore effects all hit the funky spot . Popping up in neat bit parts are Ray's onetime wife Dawn Wildsmith as brassy deranged prostitute Lori , Michael Shoyne as cynical bartender Jake , and Fox Harris as slimy voyeur baseball bat salesman Hermie . A sensationally schlocky treat .
519120	8239592	56931	9.0	An excellent and absorbing semi-sequel to the outstanding " Village of the Damned "	This surprisingly strong semi-sequel to the outstanding " Village of the Damned " centers on six highly advanced mutant kids with remarkably sophisticated intellects and acute psychic abilities from all over the globe . They all band together in London at an old rundown and abandoned church seeking refuge from a scared and uncomprehending adult world that wants to destroy them . A very tense and compelling stand-off ensues , with both the kids and the adults alike trying to figure out the proper course of action for this highly unusual and potentially dangerous situation . This film benefits from the same substantial strengths that graced the original : low-key , unflashy direction that wisely downplays special effects in favor of focusing more on the absorbing story and exceptionally well-drawn characters , uniformly fine acting from an excellent cast ( the kid actors in particular are all terrific while Ian Hendry and Alan Badel are superb as the gay couple protagonists ; this latter element is handled with refreshing taste and subtlety ) , a smart and thoughtful script , beautifully crisp black and white photography , a pleasingly eerie and ambiguous tone , and a stimulating subtext about how people automatically feel threatened by and hence want to kill anything they can't easily understand . The uncompromisingly bleak and tragic ending is genuinely heartbreaking . Moreover , the political aspects of the story give the movie an extra stinging edge and the theme of prejudice is effectively addressed with genuinely poignant and provocative results . Overall , this picture is one of those rare glorious instances where a follow-up is every bit as comparable in top-notch quality to the sterling original .
518733	8239592	307431	9.0	A fascinatingly mysterious documentary	This wonderfully strange , sad and haunting documentary relates the chilling and heart-breakingly tragic tale of Otto Rahn , a restless and sensitive visionary soul whose need for acceptance and obsessive interest in finding the Holy Grail led him down a dark and complex road which ultimately culminates with Rahn becoming an SS officer with the Nazi party in the 1930's . Rahn's time with the Nazi party proved to be fleeting because he simply wasn't tough enough to hack it as an SS officer . Director Richard Stanley tells Rahn's amazing story with tremendous clarity and absorbing urgency , covering everything from Rahn's unhappy school days to his uneasy involvement with the Nazi party to his untimely death from exposure to the cold on one fateful bitter winter night ( Rahn apparently committed suicide due to the fact that he was accused of being a homosexual , but there's some speculation that his death might have been faked ) . Stanley interviews a nicely diverse array of folks about Rahn . Rahn's loyal sister Ingebor Roehmer-Rahn and equally faithful old friend Paul A . Ladame share several especially poignant insights and anecdotes concerning Rahn . Immo Horn's stunningly gorgeous cinematography and Simon Boswell's striking , beautifully eerie score further enhance the overall hypnotic power of this remarkably offbeat and intriguing one-of-a-kind documentary .
518778	8239592	56983	9.0	Francis Ford Coppola's superbly creepy & atmospheric horror gem	After helming a few thoroughly fluffy and disposable nudie cuties in the early 60's Francis Ford Coppola made his legitimate commercial feature debut by writing and directing this moodily Gothic horror mystery thriller under the sage aegis of irrefutable legendary exploitation movie ace Roger Corman , with Jack Hill handling second unit production chores . After her husband suddenly dies of a heart attack , greedy , scheming , venomous femme fatale Luana Anders goes to hubby's moldy old isolated lakeside castle family estate in Ireland to convince her batty , domineering mother-in-law to give her a huge chunk of the inheritance . Unfortunately , a murderous member of the wacko dysfunctional and superstitious clan starts to bump folks off with an axe . Late , great , arrestingly off-beat and unconventionally beautiful cult actress Anders shines in a rare substantial lead role while the always excellent Patrick Magee contributes a lively performance as an astute , sharp-tongued doctor . Handsomely photographed in crisp black and white by Charles Hanawalt , scored to exquisitely lush and brooding orchestral perfection by prolific AIP in-house composer Ronald Stein , further graced by a genuinely flesh-crawling spooky atmosphere and highlighted by several deftly executed murder set pieces ( the scene where an underwear-clad Anders gets her brutal just desserts after taking a midnight swim is both truly sexy and shockingly nasty ) , this marvelously eerie and effective little low-budget beaut stands tall as a sterling early testament to Coppola's significant cinematic prowess .
518071	8239592	87170	9.0	A very cute , charming and even touching cartoon	Adorable and intrepid little redhead girl Dot bravely ventures into the Australian outback in search of a missing baby kangaroo . Assisting Dot on her perilous quest is a comically mischievous rabbit called " funny bunny , " who constantly makes amusingly ill-advised and unsuccessful attempts at passing himself off as the missing kangaroo ( " funny bunny " also supplies the lion's share of the engagingly quirky and deadpan humor ) . During her lengthy and eventful odyssey Dot encounters a colorful array of off-beat and interesting local wildlife which includes lazy koalas who only want to eat and sleep , a busy platypus who doesn't have any time to talk , a cranky possum who hates noise , slithery snakes , cunning and unctuously sinister crocodiles , a kindly flying fox , a chatty and gregarious crab , a helpful turtle , a weary wombat and speedy emus . This is a very sweet and good-natured cartoon kid's feature which blends animation with live action quite well ; it's technically a bit rough and crude by today's more sophisticated standards , but the animation possesses a certain irresistible plain'n'pretty appeal all the same . Moreover , the film itself is refreshingly bereft of any cynicism or irony ; it's got a purity and innocence to it that's genuinely endearing . There's a real warmth evident as well which makes this lovely little gem extremely touching ( the plot revelation that " funny bunny " is only trying to find a surrogate mother to love and take care of him because both of his parents were killed by hunters is quite moving ) . The lively and catchy songs ( my favorite is the hilarious " Termites " ditty ) , the beautiful nature photography , the gorgeous scenery and especially the overall pleasant and upbeat tone further add to the movie's considerable charm .
518667	8239592	79138	9.0	David Cronenberg's excellent , exciting and engrossing racetrack drama	Almighty B-movie he-man William Smith calls his own shots , fights to keep his integrity and stubbornly refuses to knuckle under to the Man's rigid stay on the narrow path and just do what you're told nonsense as fiercely autonomous and uncompromising champion professional race car driver Lonny " Lucky Man " Johnson , a rugged individualist in excelsis who butts heads with venal crudbag big company greedy jerk Phil ( John Saxon in peak snaky , slimy , lizard charisma oozing from every scuzzy pore form ) and attempts to rekindle the flame with supportive , but long-suffering erstwhile old lady Sammy ( a lively , luminous performance by late , great , simply gorgeous 70's drive-in movie goddess Claudia Jennings in her final film role ) . David Cronenberg's typically precise , meticulous direction , ably abetted by Mark Irwin's sparkling , slicker-than-fresh-motor-oil cinematography , Fred Mollin's vivacious banjo-plucking and harmonica-wailing country and western score , rough-thrashing rock tunes by Michael Stanley , superlative acting , a firm , moving camaraderie between Smith and his pit crew , such always pleasing exploitation picture ingredients as a little nudity and soft-core sex , wild fisticuffs , gritty , ragged-around-the-edges iconoclastic characters , hard-hitting profane dialogue , and the expectedly thrilling pedal - pushed - to - the - near - breaking - point - medal neck-snappingly fast and dangerous racetrack action ( said racetrack action smokes more than the faulty exhaust fumes on a freaky souped-up funny car ) , offers a tantalizingly vivid and absorbing evocation of the racetrack milieu and its funky subculture ( fawning groupies , harshly competitive male rivalry , on the take race officials , grimy , incredibly loyal and courageous pit crews , faceless fascistic corporate sponsor scum ) that's so exact and credible that it will overpower the viewer's nostrils with the fetid stench of hot sweat , filthy petrol , stale beer and greasy engines . Better still , the gutsy , heartfelt script Cronenberg co-wrote with Phil Savoth and Courtney Smith tackles head-on the eternally winning and right-on theme of a " be your own self and to hell with anyone who tries to cramp my style " - type loner nonconformist daring to stand up to and willingly defy the staid , restrictive , it-don't-do-no-one-any-good sectarian code of conduct that anal retentive conformist bilge naturally epitomizes . A rowdy , rollicking and boisterously romping break-from-the-mold grindhouse feature departure for Cronenberg , this extremely entertaining and damn satisfying , but alas unjustly obscure and underrated motorhead outing deserves to be both better known and more widely seen . Fortunately , the outstanding Blue Underground DVD gives this honey the deluxe treatment : It's a beautiful widescreen presentation along with a fine and informative Cronenberg commentary , delightful interviews with William Smith , John Saxon , and Mark Irwin , the theatrical trailer , and a pretty extensive still and poster gallery .
517933	8239592	82869	9.0	A superbly gritty and exciting science fiction action thriller	There's something sinister afoot on Jupitor's third moon of Io . The workers of a bleak mining colony are becoming crazy and killing themselves because they are being fed an amphetamine which not only increases their productivity , but also causes them to become psychotic . It's up to stalwart , morally sound and responsible Marshal William T . O'Niel ( a characteristically strong and personable performance by the always dependable Sean Connery ) to lay down the law and put a stop to things before they get any worse . Writer / director Peter Hyams creates a plausibly grim'n'grimy future where greed and profit take precedent over morality and human lives , expertly generates plenty of tension from the absorbing premise , maintains a steady quick pace throughout , and deftly stages one cracking corker of a rousing last third with two assassins arriving at Io with the specific intent of killing O'Niel . Connery effortlessly carries the picture with his considerable charismatic presence , receiving terrific support from Frances Sternhagen as a cranky , sarcastic doctor , Kila Markham as his fed-up , long-suffering wife , Peter Boyle as the blithely corrupt general manager , James B . Sikking as a cynical , wisecracking on the take deputy , and Steven Berkoff as a crazed miner who flips out . Jerry Goldsmith's beautifully moody and stirring score , the first-rate special effects ( the miniatures in particular are amazing ) , Stephen Goldblatt's rough , grainy cinematography , and the grungy set design are all likewise uniformly fantastic . Moreover , the film earns bonus accolades for neatly avoiding certain tiresome clichés . For example , the villains never threaten to either kidnap or murder Connery's wife and son . In addition , Sternhagen comes to Connery's aid instead of the other way around . Intelligent , engrossing and above all exciting , " Outland " sizes up as one of the best and most shamefully underrated adult science fiction movies made in the early 80's .
519403	8239592	75261	9.0	An excellent & imaginatively grotesque 70's killer animal winner	This exceptional killer worm flick marked the auspicious and impressive debut of great , shamefully unsung B-horror picture writer / director Jeff Lieberman , who followed up this slimy winner with the outstanding homicidal hippie acidhead landmark " Blue Sunshine " and the wickedly subversive , gender role reversal wackos-in-the-woods " Deliverance " variant " Just Before Dawn , " plus also blessed us with the nifty 80's direct-to-video item " Remote Control " and the recent funky hoot " Satan's Little Helper . " This skin-crawling delight rates highly as the best , creepiest and most deftly executed of the many revolt-of-nature fright films that were hugely popular and fashionable throughout the 70's . A whole lot of wriggling worms , juiced into a lethal , carnivorous , mankind-devouring frenzied mass by an electric cable downed in a fierce rain storm , nosh on the sleazy , boorish , hideously unfriendly local yokels which populate a drab little Georgia backwoods armpit hamlet . The premise sounds pretty awful , but Lieberman's hardy , adroit direction , wittily well-observed script , occasional dollops of wry black humor that sardonically poke fun at the plot's inherent absurdity ( skeptical good-for-nothing sheriff Peter MacLean first hears about the vicious invertebrates while ravenously eating a teeming plate of spaghetti , a truly inspired spoof of the famous " Psycho " shower sequence has worms instead of water seeping out of the shower head ) , and a welcome dearth of pompous , heavy-handed moralizing which tends to mar several similar nature-runs-amuck eco-scare tales ( e . g . , the horrendously portentous " Frogs " ) make a world of difference , thereby converting the unpromising plot into a most pleasant surprise indeed . Moreover , the worm attack set pieces are disgustingly convincing and thus quite jolting ( the horrific highlight occurs when vile redneck degenerate R . A . Dow has his face feasted on by the grody flesh-eating buggers ) , the refreshingly unmacho , but still resourceful Don ( " He Knows You're Alone " ) Scardino as the bright , bookish , hopelessly out-of-his-element college educated New York city boy hero and ravishing redhead Patricia ( " Cockfighter " ) Pearcy as Scardino's sweet , smart , fetching Southern belle girlfriend give nicely appealing performances , Joseph Mangine's crisp , evocative cinematography vividly captures a tangibly grungy and uninviting shabby small stickville town gone to seed atmosphere , Rick Baker's stand-out , often startling special make-up effects are typically first-rate ( a post chewed-up Dow , dubbed " Wormface , " makes for a notably ghastly sight to behold ) , there's a beautifully eerie opening credits sequence ( the odd , austere children's song played during the credits is positively haunting ) , and the all-around sound acting is up to snuff . All in all , this honey really makes the grade as a genuinely frightening and very satisfying terror treat .
518202	8239592	330950	9.0	A very fine and informative retrospective documentary	This fascinating and illuminating 52 minute retrospective documentary offers a wealth of tasty trivia about the making of Dario Argento's terrific horror cult classic " Suspiria . " The people interviewed in the doc are Argento , co-writer Daria Nicolodi , cinematographer Luciano Tovoli , Goblin band members Claudio Simonetti ( he sings all the creepy verses in the incredible score ) , Massimo Morante , Fabio Pignatelli , and Agostino Marangolo , and cast members Jessica Harper , Stefania Casini ( who readily acknowledges that she was thrilled to work with Argento ) , and the ever-quirky Udo Kier . Topics discussed herein are the origins of the story ( Nicolodi based the dance academy on an actual prestigious school that teaches the black arts ! ) , the elegant star presence of Joan Bennett , Goblin's fantastic freaky score , Argento's highly distinctive style , Tovoli's use of the soon-to-be obsolete Technicolor process to obtain the incredibly bold and vibrant color scheme that's featured in the film , Harper and Casini hitting it off on the set , that the movie is basically a dark fairy tale ( Argento cites the Walt Disney animated picture " Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs " as a major influence on " Suspiria " ) , and the ongoing legacy of the film . Moreover , Casini admits that her unforgettably brutal death scene was a nightmare to shoot and Kier confesses that someone read all his dialogue to him off screen for his sole scene in the movie . Essential viewing for fans of the film .
518035	8239592	82334	9.0	An excellent and supremely unnerving 80's feminist horror knockout	Barbara Hershey gives a fiery , outstanding and wholly sympathetic performance as Carla Moran , a willful and fiercely self-sufficient young single California mother of three kids who's brutally and relentlessly raped by an evil amorous apparition . Carla seeks the aid of earnest , but incredulous psychiatrist Phil Schneidermann ( nicely played by Ron Silver ) and several of his fellow disbelieving shrinks , who all try to convince Carla that the whole Stygian ordeal is self-inflicted . Carla balks at their supercilious , coldly pragmatic theories and enlists the help of a group of eager , open-minded parapsychologists in order to rid herself of the maleficent lascivious spirit's unwanted attention . Most film critics tend to gleefully trash " The Entity " as a particularly absurd piece of crudely sensationalistic fright flick foolishness , but I personally think it's a fine , engrossing , refreshingly off-beat and often genuinely frightening ( the frequent phantasmagoric sexual assaults are quite violent and upsetting , realistically capturing the true horror and demeaning nature of rape itself ) supernatural horror thriller . Sidney J . Furie's tight , proficient direction effectively creates and sustains a tense , menacing , claustrophobic mood ( Furie's constant use of taut close-ups which usually center on Hershey do a bang-up job of forcefully rendering Carla's profound sense of dread and alienation ) . Insanely prolific unsung B-movie composer Charles ( " Invasion of the Bee Girls , " " Cujo " ) Bernstein's wired , driving score ( I absolutely love the wickedly wailin ' guitar ! ) , Stephen H . ( " Something Wicked This Way Comes , " " Body Double " ) Burum's fluid , mobile cinematography , and Stan ( " Aliens , " " Pumpkinhead " ) Winston's typically stand-out make-up f / x contribute greatly to the picture's deeply unsettling potency . The themes of skeptics vs . true believers , science vs . psychology , and especially how difficult it is for a woman to be assertive and independent in a male-dominated society are keenly observed and neatly integrated into the compact , absorbing narrative ( " The Entity " at its extremely confrontational and provocative core is essentially a true feminist horror film about the many ways society tries to keep women in their place , with the ghost representing misogyny and male oppression at its most savage and unmerciful ) . Although not without its flaws ( at a rather bloated 125 minutes it's much too long and hence drags in spots ) , " The Entity " nonetheless overall makes the grade as a superior spectral spookshow .
518573	8239592	105810	9.0	A poignant and powerful portrait of the gritty plight of homeless urban street kids	Dermott Mulroney gives a very commanding and outstanding performance as King , a tough , street smart , ask-for-no-favors recent parolee who lives on the mean streets in and around Hollywood Boulevard ; he relates his arduous everyday experiences to prison psychologist Lara San Giacomo and basically acts as a wise , protective father figure to a ragtag bunch of hapless , homeless , penniless runaway youths trying to eke out a meager existence in the City of Angels . An incisive , absorbing , down and dirty look at the unceasingly grim , tense , often distressfully uncertain day-to-day lifestyle of destitute , on their own abandoned derelict kids and the bleak drug and violence-infested hellhole they exist in , " Where the Day Takes You " manages for the most part to be appropriately harsh and hard-hitting , rarely pleasant or overly cloying . In fact , this occasionally potent and always enthralling film has a raw , squalid , rough-edged semi-verite feel to it , thanks to Mark Rocco's firm , keen , tough-minded direction and King Baggot's crisp , fluid , starkly lit cinematography ( a cruelly eagle-eyed Steadicam is put to sporadic and quite effective use ) . While Mulroney clearly dominates the picture with his sterling , supremely charismatic portrayal of King , the other cast members who play equally on the skids adolescents are just as fine : Lara Flynn Boyle as a guileless new runaway who bolted away from home because her brother was sexually abusing her , Sean Astin as a pathetic , doomed heroin addict ( the scene where Astin vomits all over himself is very powerful and his ultimate fate is unforgettably chilling and disturbing ) , Balthazar Getty as a sullen male hustler , Will Smith as a brash crippled smartaleck , James LeGros as King's loyal best friend , Peter Dobson as a brutal punk hood , and , yes , even tacky , tubby tabloid TV show host Rikki Lake as a peevish , abrasive fat chick are all superb . Other strong thespic contributions are turned in by Adam Baldwin and Rachel Ticotin as cops , a disgustingly on-target Kyle MacLachen as an odious , deceitfully " sympathetic " drug dealer , Leo Rossi as Astin's ineffectual father , Stephen Tobolowsky as a wimpy , shyly courteous gay client who uses Getty for titillation , Alyssa Milano as an underaged prostitute , Robert Knepper as a conceited rock singer , and an unbilled Christian Slater as an interviewer at a drug rehabilitation clinic . Downbeat and depressing for sure , but still a real poignant powerhouse movie just the same .
518470	8239592	90915	9.0	A splendidly sparky & provocative futuristic Aussie sci-fi winner	1990 : Following a second catastrophic Wall Street stock market crash and a horrendous bloodbath called " The Great White Massacre , " as well as a sudden drastic food shortage , inflation skyrocketing and unemployment hitting an all-time high , society has gone completely down the stinky toilet . The cops are ineffectual , savage hordes of uninhibited youths in souped-up hot rods ( " car boys " ) run amuck on the devastated streets , and the ratings hungry media ghoulishly document the general blood-spilling chaos for every last morbid thrill they can milk from all the anarchy ( gee , this bleak future sure seems a lot like the early 21st century , now doesn't it ? ) . Jimmy " Crabs " Rossinni ( winningly played by scrawny runt Roger Manning , who makes for a refreshingly unmacho brains over brawn hero ) , a cocky , blustery , but basically decent and resourceful bloke , and his newfound airhead gal pal Carmen ( brunette cutie Natalie McCurry ) go to the local outdoor passion pit Star Drive-In in Jimmy's gorgeous ' 56 Chevy to catch a flick . While Jimmy and Carmen are preoccupied doing just what you think , the cops steal two of Jimmy's wheels , therefor stranding him and Carmen at the drive-in . Jimmy finds out that the authoritarian police are rounding up wild-assed punk kids and dumping them into sprawling concentration camp-like drive-ins which pacify its inhabitants with a mentally stultifying diet of greasy diner food , cheap beer , raucous rock music , and cheesy low-grade exploitation movies ( any similarity between this plot synopsis and my real lifestyle is purely coincidental ) . Jimmy , not one for being submissive to any uptight restrictive establishment , plots to escape from the drive-in's repressive confines so he can live his life the way he wants to again . Smoothly directed by Aussie B-pic specialist Brian Trenchard-Smith ( who also did the grim futuristic " The Most Dangerous Game " variant " Turkey Shoot , " a clip of which can be glimpsed playing on a drive-in screen ) , this bang-up little beaut bubbles , burns and blazes brilliantly with a brash , cheeky , waggishly irreverent tone , handsome , dexterous , sun-bleached , neon-hazed cinematography by Paul Murphy , a fantastically catchy and thrashin ' New Wave rock'n'roll soundtrack , fresh , dynamic acting from an exuberant no-name cast , a top-drawer lowdown bluesy score by Frank Strangio , a very cool funky-punky look and feel , and several extremely visceral , muscular , gut-rippingly thrilling knock-you-flat-on-your-bum dazzling action sequences ( an appropriately brutal hand-to-hand fight scene , a few incendiary shoot-outs , and a couple of explosively frenzied sparks a flyin ' and autos going ' BOOM ! car chases which are topped off with a rousing do-or-die final victory jump ) . All that above cited stuff certainly smokes , but what really makes " Dead End Drive-In " such an absolute dilly is the surprisingly meaty and provocative thematic substance found in Peter Smalley's wittily right-on script , which ingenuously uses the familiar central premise of a lone stubborn individualist tenaciously refusing to kowtow to an oppressive square system to thoughtfully explore the stimulating topics of independence vs . conformity , assertiveness vs . passivity , racism ( when the cops discharge a gaggle of Asian immigrants into the drive-in the white majority immediately takes offense and feels threatened ) , fascism , and how the strongly felt need to act and think for yourself creates an indomitable iron will that won't buckle regardless of all the fearsome obstacles one has to surmount in order to achieve true freedom in life . The excellent Anchor Bay DVD offers a fine widescreen presentation along with a very enjoyable and informative Brian Trenchard-Smith commentary , the theatrical trailer , and a rather paltry still and poster gallery .
519195	8239592	89869	9.0	A splendidly singular & often stimulating sci-fi end-of-the-world sleeper	Fiercely self-reliant ordinary chap scientist Zac Hobson ( a marvelously vivid and vibrant performance by Bruno Lawrence ) wakes one one fateful morning to discover that a top secret experiment he's been working on called Operation Flashlight has created a lethal tear in the universe that in turn has caused every living creature except Zac to completely disappear . The opening third of this smart , witty , wholly absorbing and wonderfully idiosyncratic science fiction end-of-the-world thriller ingeniously mines a fresh and inspired line in surprising off-center humor . At first the resourceful Zac makes the best of a bad situation by residing in a swanky palatial abode , eating exquisite expensive cuisine and joyfully pillaging an abandoned shopping mall of its choicest material products . Eventually the hopelessness of Zac's wretchedly lonely plight makes him go gloriously off the wall bonkers . Zac talks to himself while playing a solitary game of pool , resorts to wearing a woman's half-slip as his sole article of clothing , declares himself ruler of the planet , blows up a gas station , and , in the film's single most sublimely audacious scene , storms into a derelict church toting a shotgun and threatens to blast a statue of Christ to pieces unless God manifests himself in the flesh for a face-to-face confrontation ( " Come out or I'll shoot the kid ! " ) . Alas , this divinely fruitcake nuttiness dissipates when Zac discovers plucky redhead Joanne ( radiantly played by the lovely Allison Rutledge ) and intimidating mystical Maori native Abi ( the commanding Peter Smith ) . Zac and Abi engage in a predictable mano-a-mano competition to be the sole recipient of Joanne's affections and have an immediate distrust of each other due to racial differences . Fortunately , the plot gets back on suspenseful track when a second possibly more disastrous catastrophe looms on the gloomy horizon , thus forcing our beleaguered trio to take action to prevent this holocaust from wiping out the human race altogether . Geoff Murphy's bang-up direction skillfully creates a potently troubled sense of compelling mystery , places marked emphasis on the engaging characters , makes wisely judicious use of special effects , shifts the tone from playfully funny to grimly serious with remarkable adroitness , and concludes the feature with an unforgettably haunting final image . The bright , wryly preceptive script by Lawrence , Sam Pillsbury and Bill Baer thoughtfully explores man's poignant need for the company of other people in order to retain both sanity and humanity , the human race's deep-seated will to survive no matter what , and the dire consequences beget by mankind's arrogant tampering in delicate areas where he quite frankly does not belong . A splendidly singular and oftentimes stimulating sleeper .
519066	8239592	68190	9.0	A truly delightful and magical musical fantasy treat	This delightfully off-beat , imaginative and hugely entertaining musical fantasy adaptation of Lewis Carroll's often told classic tale displays a sense of pure joy and unbridled creativity that's both quite infectious and tremendously enjoyable in comparable measure . First off , there are many marvelously manic moments of divinely demented and inspired off-the-wall lunacy . The sequence with Robert Helpmann as the hysterically bonkers Mad Hatter , a perfectly cast Peter Sellers as the equally insane March Hare and Dudley Moore as the sleepy Doormouse in particular hits a note of total comic pandemonium that's a riot to watch . The sequence with Spike Milligan as the Gryphon and Michael Hordern as the marvelously melancholy Mock Turtle likewise takes off with a wacky vigor that's just a hoot to see . And the deliciously delirious courtroom climax builds to a sidesplitting crescendo of beautifully bent , batty and berserk bedlam as well . The remarkable cast of first-rate British thespians couldn't be better : Fred and Frank Cox are flat-out hilarious as Tweedledum and Tweedledee , the ever droll'n'dotty Sir Ralph Richardson makes for a splendid Caterpillar , Peter Bull in drag is a fabulously grotesque Duchess , Flora Robson an extremely fearsome Queen of Hearts , Dennis Price a suitably ineffectual King of Hearts , and Michael Crawford is simply outstanding as the White Rabbit . Geoffrey Unsworth's sumptuous cinematography , shot in dewy soft focus , effectively depicts a dreamy atmosphere that's genuinely otherworldly and entrancing . John Barry's spirited score and the surrealistic sets and costumes further enhance the flaky merriment . Best of all is the extraordinary Fiona Fullerton as Alice ; she's so cute , sweet and utterly endearing , with a nice singing voice and a winningly sincere presence , plus she's an undeniably adorable and engaging brunette beauty , that she effortlessly keeps the viewer enchanted and enthralled with Alice's colorful and eventful experiences in Wonderland .
518073	8239592	116442	9.0	A truly terrific & delightful slice of rock history drama gem	The chronically under-appreciated Illeana Douglas gives a characteristically glowing , winsome , totally spot-on performance as aspiring singer / songwriter Denise Waverly , who during a very turbulent and wildly eventful fifteen year time span goes from being a frustrated , creatively stifled behind-the-scenes magic maker to eventually acquiring the clout and courage to branch out on her own to sing her own material in a strong , assertive , independent female voice . Learning under the expert tutelage of cranky , eccentric , misanthropic Brill Building impresario Joel Millner ( a fabulously freaky John Turturro ) and enduring a steady succession of unsuccessful romantic relationships with footloose , insecure , insensitive bohemian songwriter Howard Castatt ( a perfectly jerky Eric Stoltz ) , conventional married disc jockey John Murray ( a typically fine Bruce Davison ) , and brilliantly innovative , but paranoid and temperamental surf-rock composer Jay Phillips ( a splendidly spaced-out Matt Dillon ) , the extremely intelligent and resilient Denise uses her bittersweet life experiences as prime fodder for her ever evolving and emotionally charged songs . Flavorfully documenting rock music's growth from effervescent girl group pop to trippy psychedelic experimentation to intensely personal singer / songwriter confessional tunes , Allison Anders ' simply sensational feature , loosely based on the real-life exploits of Carole King ( besides the obviously King-influenced Denise , most of the other characters are clearly composites of various actual rock people as well ) and executive produced by Martin Scorsesse , crackles with all the joyous vibrancy and infectious exuberance of the marvelously dynamic and exciting music scene its set in . Anders ' deft , assured direction and sharply perceptive script , both keenly tuned in to the mercurial zeitgeist of the 60's and the then burgeoning women's right movement , works as both invigorating rock music history and inspirational pro-feminist tract alike . The splendidly catchy and melodious Larry Klein-produced soundtrack , Jean Yves Escoffier's smooth , agile , gliding cinematography , a story which manages to be genuinely touching without ever lapsing into mawkishly contrived sentiment , an absorbing , minutely detailed backstage glimpse at the pop music songwriting and recording process , and the uniformly superlative acting - - Patsy Kensit as Denise's longtime songwriting partner and loyal gal pal Cheryl Steed , Bridget Fonda as awkward closeted lesbian pop singer Kelly Porter , and David Clennon as a flaky hippie shrink are especially terrific - - round out this positively radiant and utterly delightful gem .
519099	8239592	72236	9.0	Jack Hill's slyly subversive 70's cheerleader comedy treat	Special credit must go to the ever-surprising and enterprising Jack Hill for making the single most wickedly subversive film in the popular 70's cheerleader sub-genre . Sure , it certainly delivers the prerequisite ample doses of silly slapstick humor and tasty sex and gratuitous nudity , but along with that sleazy stuff we also have a remarkably astute critique of gender roles and sexual stereotypes as well as a deliciously sly and playful sense of anarchic humor . Sassy Mesa University underground newspaper reporter Kate ( winningly played by lovely brunette sprite Jo Johnston ) decides to pose as a cheerleader in order to get the straight dope for an article on " female exploitation in contemporary society . " Kate soon discovers that there's much more to being a cheerleader than just sexy short skirts and fluffy pom-poms . They're actually troubled individuals with serious issues : Sweet Rainbeaux Smith is a frustrated virgin who's eager to learn more about sex , Colleeen Camp is a snotty , stuck-up rich bitch who always gets what she wants , and Rosanne Katon ( " Playboy " ' s September ' 78 Playmate of the Month ) is having an affair with a married college professor . The seemingly cocky and sexist star football player turns out to be a nice , sensitive guy and the allegedly radical hippie college newspaper editor ultimately gets exposed as a hypocritical misogynistic phony . Moreover , both the shady campus dean and the duplicitous football coach are involved in a numbers racket . Wow , talk about campus unrest ! Besides the unusually sound plot and provocative political subtext ( both very rare and welcome qualities in the often schlocky and strictly superficial cheerleader sub-genre ) , " The Swinging Cheerleaders " further boasts a wonderfully lush'n'plush look , uniformly solid acting , nifty policeman bits by crusty character actor John Quade and veteran Hollywood stuntman Bob Minor ( who also popped up in " Coffy , " " Foxy Brown " and " Switchblade Sistors " for Jack Hill ) , and a hilariously wild'n'wacky slapstick finale . Clips from this gem are featured in the acclaimed Errol Morris documentary " The Thin Blue Line . "
518241	8239592	483607	9.0	A wonderfully wild and wired futuristic sci-fi / action blast	2035 . A lethal virus has decimated most of Glasgow , Scotland . The city has been closed off to protect London , England from the plague . When a new deadly strain of the virus threatens to infect Great Britain , the government officials send an elite team of top officers led by the extremely hard-nosed and resourceful Major Eden Sinclair ( a splendidly steely portrayal by Rhona Mitra ) into Glasgow to find a cure within 48 hours . The team runs afoul of both dangerous cannibal renegades and a bizarre retro Middle Ages medieval society . Writer / director Neil Marshall relates the lively and engrossing story at a constant brisk pace , maintains a properly bleak and violent tone throughout , stages the action set pieces with considerable rip-snorting gusto ( the savage swordfights , bloody gunplay , and go-for-broke frenzied vehicular carnage all seriously smoke in no uncertain terms ) , doesn't skimp on the grisly gore ( make sure to watch the unrated version ) , and further spices things up with a deliciously dry'n'droll sense of very British pitch-black humor . Of course , Marshall pays affectionate homage to such choice post-apocalyptic classics as " Escape from New York " ( Sinclair has a funky mechanical eye ) , " Damnation Alley , " and the " Mad Max " pictures . Better still , the narrative becomes more gleefully absurd and over the top as it unfolds , with the gloriously wacky zenith reached with a decidedly sick and unwholesome arena diner party held by a rowdy urban gang of deranged flesh-eating punk lunatics led by the unhinged Sol ( marvelously essayed with lip-smacking hammy aplomb by Craig Conway ) . The excellent cast qualifies as another substantial asset : Mitra excels as one exceptionally tough and formidable heroine , Conway lets it all hang out as Sol , Lee-Anne Liebenberg impresses as Sol's fierce warrior woman main squeeze Viper , plus there are sturdy supporting turns by Bob Hoskins as Sinclair's wise , no-nonsense superior Bill Nelson , Adrian Lester as rugged Sergeant Norton , David O'Hara as ruthless , slippery diplomat Michael Canaris , Malcom McDowell as crazed scientist Dr . Marcus Kane , MyAnna Buring as Kane's feisty wayward daughter Cally , and Alexander Siddig as pompous prime minister John Hatcher . Kudos are also in order for Sam McCurdy's slick , stunning cinematography , the first-rate special effects , Tyler Bates ' ominous , pulsating score , and the lavish production design . A real exciting , energetic , and above all hugely entertaining pip .
518395	8239592	184993	9.0	A hilarious horror black comedy short	An evil and possessive little girl ( delightfully played with wicked aplomb by the adorable Elyse Plantico ) uses voodoo on a hapless guy ( the excellent Cory Rouse ) in order to ruin the man's date with her beautiful single mother ( ravishing brunette J . B . ) . Writer / director Gregg Bishop made this six minute horror comedy short in six days for under a $1 , 000 dollars as his student project for USC ; he expertly mines a fine line in playfully twisted dark humor and brings an energy and ingenuity to the simple , yet funny and effective premise that's a complete treat to watch . The cast tackle their roles with equally commendable gusto , with special kudos in order for Rouse's extraordinary physical prowess at pulling off an uproarious series of crazy pratfalls with remarkable skill and agility . Jonathan Ke Quan's stark and lively black and white cinematography offers some great atmospheric lighting and keeps the hand-held camera constantly moving . Mark Justin's alternately bouncy and shivery score also hits the spot . An absolute hoot .
518282	8239592	73896	10.0	A truly terrific 70's drive-in trucker classic	One of the earliest - - and hence best - - of a handful of 70's trucker movies , a once quite hot , but now hopelessly passé sub-genre which beget a mixed bag of films which includes the stellar Claudia Jennings vehicle " Truck Stop Women , " the not half bad Peter Fonda pic " High Ballin ' , " the great'n'gritty overlooked sleeper " Road Movie , " Sam Peckinpah's excruciatingly stupid " Convoy , " the alarmingly atrocious Chuck Norris chopsocky turkey " Breaker ! Breaker ! , " and the sturdy made-for-TV item " Steel Cowboy . " Jan-Michael Vincent , whose career in the Me Decade was all over the map , peaking with " The Mechanic " and " Big Wednesday " and hitting a wonderfully wretched all-time low with the gloriously godawful post-nuke sci-fi atrocity " Damnation Alley , " here gives one of his strongest , most convincing and engaging performances to date as Carrol Jo Hummer , an earnest , moral , youthful independent Diesel driver who finds out that his employers are crooked bastards who sell illegal contraband on the side . Greatly appalled by this discovery , Hummer decides to blow the whistle on the entire unlawful business , becoming a modern-day folk hero in the process and subsequently putting both himself and his plucky wife Jerri ( a stand-out portrayal by the always fine and assertive Kay Lenz ) in considerable jeopardy . Director Jonathan Kaplan , who was then on a real B-movie roll churning out such kick-ass exploitation flicks as " Night Call Nurses , " " The Student Teachers , " and " Truck Turner " on a regular basis , hits a brisk , solid groove at the very start of the film and masterfully sustains it to the thrilling end , expertly milking the forever effective and appealing " one lone little man against the big , bad system " populist hero subtext in Ken Friedman's tightly efficient script for maximum socko entertainment . Kudos also to the exceptional supporting cast ridden with familiar film faces : the late , great , ever-delightful Slim Pickens as corrupt truck stop manager Duane Haller , L . Q . Jones at his most sublimely slimy and serpentine as head heavy Buck Westle , Martin Kove as one of Westle's thuggish goons , R . G . Armstrong as a shifty , manipulative prosecuting attorney , veteran character actor Don Porter as the smug CEO who's running the whole no-count operation , frequent Kaplan pic co-star Johnny Ray McGhee as an angry black trucker , Sam Laws as McGhee's rascally lovable ol ' coot pop , and the irreplaceable Dick Miller as fidgety , peppery gear-jammer R . " Birdie " Corman . Further enhanced by Fred Koenekamp's crisp , inventive cinematography , David Nichtern's stirring score , and Valerie Carter tearfully warbling the marvelously mawkish country-and-western weeper " Drifting and Dreaming of You " all of three times on the soundtrack , " White Line Fever " gets a hearty ten-four from your good buddy film critic as quintessential 70's drive-in cinema at its most bluntly exciting and unpretentious best .
519265	8239592	74356	10.0	My all-time favorite 70's Bigfoot fright flick	" Creature from Black Lake " gets my vote as the single most amiable and entertaining Bigfoot fright film to ever amble onto the big screen . John David Carson and the ever-daffy Dennis ( " Truck Stop Women , " " House of 1 , 000 Corpses " ) Fimple display a breezy , relaxed , wholly personable chemistry as two eager beaver college anthropology students who visit a Louisiana stick burg to find out if stories concerning Mr . Size 25 Shoes have any basis in fact . Zestfully directed by Do-It-Yourself regional indie filmmaker Joy Houck , Jr . and cleverly written by Jim McCollough , Jr . ( who co-stars as a wily country boy who befriends our heroes ) , this fine feature boasts an endearingly playful sense of good-natured humor , likable characters , a strong spooky atmosphere , and a tasty , picturesque evocation of the Creole State's lush , marshy bayou . Furthermore , the stellar , spot-on , spirited tearin'-apart-the-scenery performances by dependable seasoned hambones Jack Elam and Dub Taylor add a substantial energy boost to the proceedings . Taylor essays his standard role of a crusty , hot-tempered hillbilly grandpappy with his trademark testy aplomb ( " Dadgum it ! " ) , but Elam steals the the entire show with his growly , eye-rolling portrayal of ornery ol ' swamp cuss trapper Joe Canton ( Elam's " nothin ' " story in particular is an absolute corker ) . Stocky , stony-faced cracker character actor Bill Thurman brings his usual low-key charm and unaffected acting style to the role of a sheriff named after then First Brother Billy Carter . Morgan Fairchild's comely sister Catherine McClenny has a sassy small part as a feisty greasy spoon waitress . In a nifty homage to " The Legend of Boggy Creek " Fimple has the holy living hell scared out of him when a guy catches him off guard while he's urinating behind a bush . The unusually adroit and sporadically expansive widescreen cinematography was done by a fledging Dean Cundey , who eventually established himself as a top director of photography with his groundbreaking gliding camera-work for " Halloween . " Jamie Mendoza-Nava's score deftly alternates between moody , menacing scareshow music and sprightly , st-kickin ' country bluegrass . The film concludes with a genuinely harrowing sequence in which Sasquatch ( Roy Tatum in an up-to-snuff excess body hair outfit ) stalks and attacks our protagonists . All in all , this dandy's a complete winner .
517960	8239592	466264	10.0	An absolute riot !	Damon Packard , the mad maverick independent cinematic genius who blessed us with the alarmingly odd and original " Reflections of Evil , " strikes again with this uproariously irreverent and no-holds-barred brutal parody of the making of the atrocious " Attack of the Clones . " This 45 minute comedy short starts on a fiercely funny note with a redubbed Tony Curtis giving us a gut-busting snappy mock bio on Packard . The savage hilarity continues with a simply sidesplitting fake trailer for " Attack of the Clones " which comes complete with foul profane dialogue and choice clips from such superior low-budget sci-fi fare as " Inseminoid " and " Battle Beyond the Stars . " Packard stars as a hapless special effects artist who's forced to do CGI digital work for George Lucas on a tight budget and even tighter schedule . Throughout the course of this movie Packard paints a scathing portrait of Lucas as a pompous clueless artist who's lost touch with reality and thus makes only bland , sexless , antiseptic pictures devoid of any real merit or substance . Packard's barbed satiric potshots at the appallingly blatant artificiality of CGI ( " CGI rules ! Go , digital , go ! " ) are likewise quite vicious and hence totally on the money as well ( the special effects guys use footage of homeless psychotic black folks as templates for CGI characters ! ) . The humor is appropriately vicious , biting and politically incorrect , reaching a simply stupendous apex at the incredible conclusion in which a theater full of geeky toy lightsaber-brandishing " Star Wars " fans are made to seem like they are cheering for the infamous nude male wrestling sequence in Ken Russell's " Women in Love " ! An absolute take-no-prisoners ferociously amusing hoot .
519300	8239592	83281	10.0	A delightfully idiosyncratic documentary gem	Acclaimed documentary filmmaker Errol Morris follows his remarkable debut feature " Gates of Heaven " with this equally astonishing little doozy about the eccentric residents of the remote backwater hamlet of Vernon , Florida . Among the folks interviewed are an endearingly zealous turkey hunter , an elderly fellow with an unusual collection of unlikely pets , another old dude who believes we all have multiple brains , a friendly worm farmer , and a couple with a jar of white sand that they claim grows on a daily basis . These colorful individuals discuss such weighty subjects as religion , the existence of God , and the meaning of life . Through these startling and compelling interviews Morris captures with bracing acuity and unflinching honesty a wholly charming and captivating sense of all-American strangeness that's both amusing and affecting in equal measure . Few movies reveal the basic absurdity of the human condition with the same stark power and poignancy as this film . Morris ' deliberately static and leisurely paced no-frills approach keeps cheap condescending humor and sordid sensationalism at bay throughout ; instead Morris in his own deliciously dry and deadpan way shows a genuine affection for these lovably loopy oddballs . Moreover , there's a vivid evocation of the sleepy small town region and the people that populate it which coupled along with the often breathtaking bucolic scenery and picturesque photography adds up to create one of the greatest portraits of everyday authentic downhome American surrealism ever committed to celluloid . A total offbeat treat which offers proof positive that ordinary life can be every bit as weird and outrageous as the best wildly imaginative fiction .
519049	8239592	67169	10.0	A hilariously horrible hoot	1480 : Cruel , evil , haughty schizophrenic holy man Guru ( a deliciously over the top performance by Neil Flanagan ) resides on the remote island of Mortavia . Guru gets his sadistic jollies out of killing and maiming thieves , voyeurs , witches and various other sinners . Crazed lesbian vampire lady Olga ( the seriously strange Jaqueline Webb ) and meek , whimpering one-eyed hunchback Igor ( an uproariously geeky turn by Jack Spencer ) assist Guru with his heinous misdeeds . Meanwhile , kindly jailer Carl ( the extremely fey Paul Lieber ) tries to save condemned fair maiden Nadja ( pretty blonde Judith Israel ) from Guru's foul clutches . Legendary Do-It-Yourself dimestore indie Staten Island schlockmeister Andy Milligan really outdoes himself with this astonishingly awful , yet often amusing and oddly entertaining period Gothic horror atrocity . The drippy'n'droning stock film library score , ratty , ugly , scratched-up cinematography ( Andy gleefully indulges in his ghastly penchant for drab static master shots to an appalling degree ) , the outrageously tasteless plot , ripely hammy eye-rolling histrionic acting from a game no-name cast ( many of whom talk with heavy New York accents ) , cynical misanthropic sensibility , cheesy gore , the hysterical bloodbath conclusion , and the gut-busting abundant anachronisms ( one villager is clearly wearing corduroy pants ! ) all ensure that this spectacularly shoddy swill is absolutely sidesplitting from stinky start to fumbled finish . A positively jaw-dropping celluloid abomination .
517893	8239592	64349	10.0	A truly timeless and terrific TV yuletide holiday special treat	I've seen this truly timeless and terrific late 60's TV yuletide holiday special classic more times than I can count and it never fails to make me feel totally elated . Jolly , lovable snowman Frosty ( exuberantly voiced with marvelously plummy gusto by Jackie Vernon ) miraculously comes to life when a discarded magic silk top hat falls atop his head . But Frosty can't stick around for long or he'll melt due to the rising temperature . Meanwhile , evil , yet inept magician Professor Hinkle ( voiced with winningly rascally snake oil élan by Billy De Wolfe ) chases after Frosty in order to get his hat back . The wonderfully catchy and merry theme song , the engagingly folksy Christmas postcard-style animation , Jimmy Durante's delightful narration ( Durante also heartily belts out the theme song ) , the endearing characters ( I love Hocus-Pocus the rabbit ! ) , and an irresistibly sweet-natured sensibility that's utterly bereft of any smug irony or sour cynicism make this lovely and radiant gem a complete joy to behold . Legendary voice actor Paul Frees lends his gloriously melodious golden pipes to the juicy supporting roles of both Santa Claus and a testy traffic cop . Essential annual seasonal viewing for kids of all ages , including crusty old adults like this humble reviewer .
519145	8239592	355032	10.0	A very thorough and fascinating behind-the-scenes making of documentary	This highly engrossing and informative documentary covers many different bases concerning the making of the fantastic fantasy adventure cult favorite " The Dark Crystal . " Among the people interviewed are Jim Henson , Frank Oz , conceptual designer Brian Froud , Froud's wife Wendy Widener , producer Gary Kurtz , Garthim supervisor Fred Nihda , Kira performer Kathryn Mullen , and choreographer Jean-Pierre Amiel . The topics covered herein include the evolution of the creatures from drawings to sculptures , the building of the puppets , how the vile reptilian villains the Skeksis are based on the seven deadly sins , the use of a large and diverse array of technicians for the demanding and ambitious project , casting mimes , dancers and acrobats as performers in the picture , the meticulous creation of a whole elaborate alternate world from the ground up , the occasional artful use of matte paintings , the building of the sets , the great stroke of having ace cinematographer Oswald Morris shoot the movie , the unique decision of having both Oz and Henson collaborate on directing the feature , and the filming of the destruction of the Skeksis castle for the thrilling climax . Everyone involved talks about all the hard work and effort that went into making " The Dark Crystal ; " any sense of smug self-congratulation is thankfully absent . Essential viewing for fans of the film .
519365	8239592	89741	10.0	Crispin Glover at his wonderfully wacky best	The gloriously gaga opening scene expertly sets the tone for the incredible , jaw-dropping , incessant and often excruciatingly riotous eccentricity to come : A silhouetted nighttime profile shot of chronically kooky and uncompromising consummate flake thesp Crispin Glover , wearing a flowing blonde wig , wind whipping his hair about in undulating waves , stands astride a mountaintop lip-syncing to Olivia Newton-John's forlorn pop ballad " Please Don't Leave Me Waiting " ! You see , Crispin's an awkward , ungainly , socially maladjusted jerkwater burg misfit with a secret hardcore infatuation with Olivia and her music , a closet fetish that's so extreme that Crispin actually dresses , acts , and - - oh gaa-wd ! - - even sings just like Olivia . Worse yet , Glover even has a " Xanadu " poster on his bedroom wall ! Crispin , after much fretting , decides to come out about his Olivia hang-up to the burg's stuffy , conservative , stubbornly set in their ways square citizens by impersonating Olivia - - he's got the wig on , plus bright red lipstick and black eyeliner ! - - and belting out one of her tunes in a shrill , scratchy , piercing soprano wail at a local talent show that's going to be broadcast on television . A very barbed and caustically funny 35 minute American Film Institute student movie project , " The Orkly Kid " doesn't pull any punches with its revealing exposure and mordant ridicule of the hidebound , close-minded , oppressively staid toe-the-line conformist mindset that's a rigid cornerstone of small town America ( " This town's enough to drive a man nuts , " Glover moans at one point ) , an uptight sensibility which leads to xenophobia and a gross inability to either tolerate or appreciate anyone courageous enough to break away from the restrictive conventional mold . Moreover , the film has the admirable guts to equate conformity with repressiveness , depicting Glover's amiable nonconformist oddball as the only person in the picture who's easygoing and enjoys life while the straight townies are sour , cranky and often down in the dumps unhappy frumps . Glover delivers a perfectly manic performance as the endearingly gonzo main character , with solid support from Stefan ( " Fear No Evil " ) Arngrim as his sole friend ( Crispin tries unsuccessfully to have Arngrim put on a gorilla suit and carry him off stage after he's done with his number ! ) , the ever-adorable Elizabeth ( " Valley Girl " ) Daily as a tarty diner waitress , and Courtney ( " Children of the Corn " ) Gains as a local bullying hick . Glover and fellow marvelously idiosyncratic celluloid quirkmeister writer / director Trent Harris reteamed for the equally amusing and abrasive " Rubin and Ed . "
517907	8239592	319185	10.0	One of the sickest and hence funniest cartoon shorts ever made !	Director John Goras earns every last ounce of my respect and admiration for making this sublimely perverse and depraved porno cartoon marvel . Jolly and adorable little yellow bird Chirpy gets seriously stoned after eating some smiling psychedelic mushrooms . Chirpy walks through the woods while tripping out of her tiny skull . Chirpy has a horrifying hallucination of a scary Satanic cow . She then encounters a huge horse and does just what you think with the enormous equine animal . Yep , what we've got here is a truly choice demented and debauched depiction of interspecies copulation that's presented all raw , raunchy and graphic . Watching Chirpy get freaky with the horse makes for often hilarious viewing . The dialogue in particular is frequently sidesplitting ( " Tastes like chicken ! " ) . Better still , we've even got a catchy'n'funky theme song and groovy 60's style acid rock music plays throughout the whole jaw-dropping 12 minutes of this gloriously gonzo gut-buster . The animation is every bit as crude and garish as it ought to be . Plus there's a poignant central message about how the power of love can overcome all boundaries . Absolutely essential viewing for fans of hardcore underground cinematic degeneracy .
