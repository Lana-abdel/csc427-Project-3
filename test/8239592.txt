518359	8239592	65470	1.0	Big bore is more like it	This so-dumb-it's-numbing Sasquatch cinema stinker holds the dubious honor of being possibly the first-ever American movie made about the legendary Bigfoot . Alas , it's also one of the worst-ever movies ever made about Bigfoot . A small tribe of Sasquatchs - - one giant bad male , three babbling females , and a homely , noisy " whattheheckisit ? " - type hybrid baby critter - - abduct luscious young human babes for unsavory procreative purposes . Everybody involved with this putrid turkey comes out stinking worse than filthy old socks . Bouncy , buxom blonde bombshell Joi Lansing , clad only in a skimpy pink nightie , runs shrieking through the woods with a grunting , lecherous Bigfoot in hot pursuit . Robert Mitchum's no-talent son Chris , trying to look tough with his scruffy beard and bandanna , makes for a pitifully unconvincing biker hero . John Carradine , sporting a hideously overdone Southern drawl and a juicy hamminess that could be made into a dozen cans of Spam , gives an unbearably unrestrained performance as traveling salesman Jasper B . Hawke , who wants to nab himself a Bigfoot so he can make a bundle exploiting the beast to the ninth degree . Robert Mitchum's no-talent brother John grates on the nerves with his insufferably whiny turn as Carradine's sniveling partner . Former cowboy movie star Ken Maynard came out of retirement to do a useless bit as an elderly shopkeeper . Comic actor Doodles Weaver briefly appears as a forest ranger . Such familiar B-picture faces as William Bonner , Jennifer Bishop and Russ Meyer starlet Haji ( the latter having a very bad overbleached bouffant ' do day ) pop up as members of a sickeningly wimpy chopper gang . The Bigfoot creatures are stupendously sorry-looking : With their tatty , you-can-see-the-seams brown gorilla costumes , buggy eyes and rubbery , puffed-out monkey faces , they resemble rejects from a fifth-rate carnival freakshow . There's little action , nudity , violence or excitement to speak of ( at one point Bigfoot wrestles a portly , out-of-it bear , but even this scene is so maladroitly staged that it fails to alleviate the incessant tedium ) . But there's plenty of dreadful dialogue ( " As a former student of archeology I recognize these markings as having a peculiar significance " ) . Among the other malevolent cinematic blunders to be found within this beyond bad Bigfoot bogusity are stubbornly stationary cinematography , a hopelessly dated " groovy " semi-psychedelic rock score , a draggy pace , a meandering narrative and , last and definitely least , Robert F . Slatzer's horribly ham-fisted so-called " direction . " The absolute pits .
518345	8239592	89745	1.0	The world ends with a whimper instead of a bang in this cruddy post-nuke sci-fi clinker	After her striking performance as Matt Dillon's unrepentant junkie nympho wife in the outstanding " Drugstore Cowboy " Kelly Lynch seemed to have one hell of a career ahead of her . Then along came the hilariously horrendous " Roadhouse " and Kelly's credibility as a serious actress went straight down the toilet . Well , it's a good thing that this deservedly obscure pot-holocaust sci-fi stinker never received much attention or otherwise Kelly would probably have never had a career to begin with . Lynch makes her unpromising and unprepossessing acting debut as Osa , who struggles to survive in your typically bleak , rotten and exacting desolate wasteland environment in which hope , jobs and especially water have become exceedingly scarce . Osa's family gets slaughtered by a bunch of mean , sneering , sadistic thugs ( Bill Moseley , Chop Top in " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2 , " pops up as one of the evil leering goons ) . After being trained to be proficient with a crossbow by obnoxiously hearty old coot Trooper , Osa proceeds to enact a harsh revenge on the thugs . Man , is this one beat flick : the leaden pace , dreadful dialogue ( " What are we going to do with you ? You ugly bag of sick st ! " ) , wooden acting , drab , plain cinematography which gives the film a bland , homely look ( the fact that the picture was shot on cheap , grainy film stock doesn't help matters any ) , curious lack of any hard , rough elements which could have supplied some desperately needed gritty conviction , an obvious climax that's telegraphed well in advance ( so much for tension ) , the meandering narrative , very colorless one-note characters ( the head nasty , snarling homosexual villain is actually named Mr . Big ! ) , poorly staged action scenes , bad guys who are too clean-cut and generic to be genuinely menacing , and , most damagingly , writer / director Oleg Egorov's pitiful inability to blend a hackneyed vengeance premise with a comparably threadbare post-nuke scenario with any flair , style , momentum or innovation all add up to one astoundingly crummy and unrewarding waste of time bomb . To sum up , this hideously lousy loser proves to be every bit as flat , arid and dreary as the barren , godforsaken desert landscape it takes place in .
519103	8239592	47507	2.0	The first and worst of the 50's yeti horror films	This rock-bottom ' 54 cheapie clinker is the first and worst fright feature made in the 50's about the legendary Abominable Snowman . This paltry carbon copy of " King Kong " ( natch ) , " The Werewolf of London , " and even the exemplary giant ant humdinger " Them ! " constitutes as a most unfortunate and inauspicious cinematic debut for the yeti . A stuffed-shirt botanist , his comparably blah assistant , and a bunch of anonymous oriental extras embark on a perilous pilgrimage into the Himalayas to discover a rare plant species . The expedition stumbles across a predatory yeti ( a very tall , gangly guy in a threadbare poorly stitched together mangy fur costume ) who in tried'n'true B-movie monster fashion makes off with the first available female he can get his grubby paws on . The team members manage to get the fair damsel back and capture the humanoid beast . They bring it to Los Angeles , only to have the ratty hairball escape and seek refuge in the City of Angel's grimy sewers . An air of total creative and budgetary impoverishment permeates every aspect of this sour lemon . There's lackluster direction by Billy Wilder's no-talent brother W . Lyle Wilder , lethargic pacing , primitive fade-outs , dry acting from a just - hitting - all - the - usual - preprogrammed - marks robotic cast , tedious running-off-at-the-mouth verbose narration ( " The first few days were uneventful , monotonous and routine , " the botanist comments early in the nonaction , a remark which serves as an apt concise critique of the film itself ) , a few stomach-knotting moments of goopy sentiment , and a pitifully unimpressive star monster . But what really deflates this celluloid lead balloon is its complete lack of any trashy vitality - - this excruciatingly sorry and static yeti stinker is so inert and lifeless that it just lies motionless on your TV screen for 71 painfully draggy and dreary minutes of sheer unbearable boredom .
518115	8239592	235245	2.0	A hideously lame'n'tame college-set horror slasher wash-out	Driven Dr . Philip Rothman ( a hopelessly insipid and less than sinister performance by Terry Lenderee ) conducts mind control experiments on students which in turn causes them to become crazy and murderous . Sound good ? Well , it sure ain't . For starters , writer / director Jerry Sangiuliano relates the meandering story at an excruciatingly sluggish pace and fails to build even a modicum of tension . Worse yet , the characters are all blah cardboard stereotypes : we've got the shameless slut ( Donna Bostany , who at least looks hot ) who sleeps with all her professors so she can earn passing grades , the no-nonsense police detective ( flatly played by Joe Lombardo ) who's determined to solve the case no matter what , and even the obligatory weirdo janitor ( Charles Lopresto , who at least looks creepy ) who's always lurking around every corner . Adding additional abject insult to already appalling injury are Larry Gelb's annoyingly shrill and redundant shivery synthesizer score , a numbing surplus of tedious talk , infrequent kill scenes , no nudity to speak of , extremely mild and largely bloodless violence , tacky 80's video game-style ( far from ) special effects , and a dissatisfying limp ending . This movie crucially lacks the necessary energy and sense of misguided enthusiasm to qualify as an enjoyably awful piece of schlock . Instead this flick is about as fun and exciting as watching two elderly turtles copulate . An immensely cruddy and unrewarding stiff .
519404	8239592	106666	2.0	A cinematic black hole from which there is no escape	You know a film is basically destined to stink worse than dirty old socks when the eternally quality-impaired Fred Olen Ray and the comparably talent-barren Jim Wynorski are listed as executive producers ( worse yet , Ray also co-wrote the " original " story ! ) , longtime hack actor Steve Barkett receives special guest star billing for his quick pre-credits appearance as a doomed astronaut and Martin Sheen's terminally drab , anything but a chip off the ol ' block brother Joe Estevez is the closet thing to a name actor in the entire cast . The horrendously derivative rag-bag premise writes a paltry check that the feeble film itself doesn't even come close to cashing : A huge , fanged , drooling dinosaurian beastie stows away on a spaceship which crash-lands in the dense , verdant , real ferny and swampy Florida bayou . Said bulky ugly creature proceeds to munch on lots of folks , causes several local animals to transform into murderous mutants ( the ferocious killer puppet armadillo is pretty laughable ) and even makes similarly infected humans metamorphosize into your standard blank-eyed , pasty-faced lethal zomboid ghouls . Steve Latshaw's flaccid direction fails to inject any sense of style or vigor into Pat Moran's threadbare script , which in turn serves as a horrible catalog of every last error one could possibly find in The Bad Movie Book of Serious Cinematic Sins . Said sins include a numbing surplus of dreary chitchat , painfully stilted dialogue ( among the choice clunky lines are " I like to watch the news sometimes , but Tom he calls it propaganda " and " This boy scout isn't going to help us find anything " ) , too much meandering around the woods in circles filler nonsense , a grave lack of any inspired or interesting individual flourishes , a poky stab at narrative thrust and , perhaps the picture's grossest , most unforgivable mistake of all , an insipid assortment of tiresomely one-note stereotypical characters ( feisty go-getter female reporter , pompous fat jerk scientist , arrogant macho dude trial guide , meek , skinny nerdy brainiac , shady , double-tongued corporate head and so on ) . The uniformly flat acting , Maxwell J . Beck's primitive cinematography ( the laborious fade-outs and clumsy creature on the prowl POV shots are especially shoddy ) , cheesy computer morphing f / x , the hokey-looking , pitifully unconvincing monster and Jeffrey Walton's droning , insufferably overwrought score definitely don't help matters any as well . Only some welcome gratuitous nudity ( ravishing brunette Blake Pickett in particular makes for a pleasingly ample eyeful sans shirt ) and a clever Hitchcock-style cameo by Sunshine State B-movie institution William Grefe as a photo on a dresser effectively detract from the otherwise overwhelmingly substantial tedium and ineptitude that's in alarming abundance in this truly wretched dreck .
518721	8239592	429573	2.0	Crude , unsubtle and terribly overwrought	I must confess that I had pretty high hopes for this horror movie considering its novel 19th century period setting , the claim that the story has some basis in documented historical fact , and a high pedigree cast which includes Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek . The plot about a wealthy family whose heretofore peaceful and opulent abode is suddenly beset by violent and frightening poltergeist activity in which the toothsome teenage daughter ( lovely Rosanna Arquette lookalike Rachel Hurd-Wood ) is the primary target of an angry and potent unrestful evil spirit certainly sounds promising , but alas said plot is severely undermined by director / co-screenwriter Courtney Solomon's dreadfully crude , hyperactive and increasingly tiresome shoot-the-fireworks style . The hyper-kinetic style with its clumsy emphasis on cheap scare tactics , over-amplified sound effects , irritatingly blaring music and a constantly darting here and there restless prowling camera wear the viewer down rather than work the viewer over like it should . Moreover , the needlessly hopped-up and histrionic hitting - you - over - the - head - with - a - frying - pan unsubtle style is jarringly at odds with the period setting , thereby negating any credibility the story might have had . Solomon makes another major narrative blunder by relating the story in flashback ; this particular story structure gives away from the very start that certain characters will survive the punishing ordeal alive and unscathed , which crucially robs the film of all of its tension . The final explanation for why the poltergeist activity is happening strives for poignancy , but Solomon's overwrought approach undermines the pathos substantially . Both Sutherland and Spacek struggle gamely to give the film a bit of class and dignity , only to have their noble efforts lost amidst the grating array of loud noises and tacky jump-out-at-you jolts . The fact that Solomon shamelessly lifts whole bits and pieces from such superior fright features as " The Entity " and " The Exorcist " adds additional appalling insult to already abject injury . If only the story had been done in a more low-key , thoughtful and understated manner this movie could have been a real solid and spooky little scarefest . As it is , very hysterical and ham-fisted , it's a crushing disappointment .
518124	8239592	88896	2.0	Horrible crud	WARNING This review features major SPOILERS Don't read this particular comment unless you've seen this film first . Shot in chintzy , unwieldy hand-held camera fashion from 1979 to 1981 on cheap , grainy , extremely unsightly all scratched-up Super 8mm film stock with the sound and dialogue poorly looped in post-production , this simply horrendous artsy fartsy college short film school project finally crept onto video in 1985 . Of course , none of this would mean jack if it wasn't for the fact that this hour long abomination stars a gawky , pudgy , insufferably whiny and unappealing Madonna as bisexual bad girl Bruna , a totally obnoxious and unsympathetic skank with a loyal cult of male and female lovers who falls for a moody , sullen , intensely unlikable hipster philosophy student college drop-out slacker jerk ( a highly annoying Jeremy Pattnosh , who also co-wrote the pompous , abysmal script and sings a majority of the atrocious tunes featured on the grating soundtrack ) . Bruna winds up being raped by her overly possessive lovers , which means that the viewer gets to see Madonna's normal-sized breasts prior to her obscenely overdone boob job she got for the pathetic documentary " Truth or Dare . " Worse yet , Bruna suffers further indignities when she's assaulted and molested in a ratty diner bathroom by loutish , grossly overbearing , motor-mouthed , wholly repugnant and irredeemable middle-aged creep Raymond Hall ( a hilariously seedy and degenerate Charles Kurtz , who's the sole actor in this misbegotten bomb who brings any vigor and conviction to his part ) . Bruna , assisted by Pattnosh and her lovers , abduct Hall and ritualistically carve the bastard up at a crazed Satanic party which concludes with the deranged participants drinking Hall's blood and consuming his flesh . Attempting to explore modern-day urban angst , despair and paranoia , with a marked emphasis on sexual deviancy and seething amorality run hideously amok , this stinker hits an infuriatingly steady succession of sour off-key notes throughout : a loud , shrill , abrasively confrontational tone which quickly wares out its welcome , a crummy visual texture that's sheer murder on the eyes , several protracted sub-MTV musical montage sequences ( the film hits its nadir when Pattnosh serenades Bruna in a grimy , graffiti-littered tunnel with an awful impromptu rap song called " Demon Lover " ) , uniformly foul and disgusting characters ( Kurtz's memorably vile sicko is actually the only remotely endearing person in the whole movie ! ) , a murky , half-hearted script which goes tediously overboard on pretentious blather , an irritating Hispanic narrator who makes asinine rambling comments at acerbating regular intervals ( " I mean , he even had an attitude , like a cat who had eaten a canary or a pigeon or something " ) , shoddy production values , and occasional horribly affected fancy-pants cinematic flourishes ( freeze frames , slow motion , archly elaborate wipes and dissolves ) . It comes as no surprise that Madonna , who was allegedly paid a whopping $100 bucks for her troubles , tried unsuccessfully to sue the filmmakers in order to prevent this dreck from being released . It's a genuine pity that she failed .
519363	8239592	211328	2.0	A dismally dull & dreary dud	Filipino horror films don't come much worse than this unbearably dull , drawn-out stiff which boasts a decent enough plot , but precious little energy in the telling of said story . In short , what we have here is a classic case of cruddy schlock movie-making that crucially lacks the necessary trashy vitality to pass muster as a fun , worthy fright flick . Jock Gaynor , who was also one of the co-producers ( " A Taste of Hell " ' s John Garwood was another one ) and designed the many boring underwater sequences featured herein , listlessly plays a treasure-seeking deep sea diver who discovers a fabled 1850 sunken galleon which contains the corpse of a legendary Moro tribe virgin princess . When Gaynor steals a priceless amulet from the princess ' skeletal remains , the skull-faced sea siren ( the gorgeous Iraida Arambulo , who's naked throughout the entire film except for a hokey monster mask that covers her cadaverous face ) comes back to life and forces Gaynor to kill seven virgins in order to appease the god that the princess was sacrificed to a century earlier . Despite a goodly serving of both gratuitous nudity and bloody violence , plus the enticing sight of sexy female leads Diane McBain and Kim Ramos walking about in skimpy bikinis , " The Deathhead Virgin " proves to be a static , lifeless , sleep-inducing waste of time thanks to Norman Foster's drab direction ( Foster , who started out as an actor prior to becoming a director , had a very uneven career which includes several episodes of Disney's " Davy Crockett " series ) , Fredy Conde's clunky , grainy cinematography , Ward Gaynor's arid , dead obvious , gab-ridden script , such excessive padding as tacky night club scenes , a horrible comic sequence in which Gaynor and his fellow diver buddy Larry Ward get drunk together on the beach , and a cock fight , the pitiful wasting of the great Vic Diaz in the nothing role of an investigating police chief who tries to piece together the whole fantastic story in a logical manner ( Vic does what he can with a thankless part , but even he's let down by lousy dubbing - - some drip with a flat , hollow tenor substitutes for Diaz's wonderfully ripe and oily baritone ! ) , cheesy solarization effects , uniformly indifferent performances from an understandably out of it cast , and Richard La Salle's slushy , overbearing score . So bad that it doesn't even qualify as enjoyable junk , this terribly lame loser of a flick should be avoided at all costs .
518317	8239592	924498	3.0	A disappointingly wimpy Hong Kong women-in-prison wash-out	In my ceaseless obsessive quest to watch the most obscure down'n'dirty exploitation features from all over the world I naturally had to have the rotten luck to stumble across this brain-numbing atrocity . Three ladies escape from a hellish women's penitentiary and go on the lam . They decide to get revenge on the various folks who are responsible for sending them to jail . Sound good ? Well , it definitely ain't . For starters , director Roy Rosenberg and writer Gary Capra , Jr . both fail to deliver the lowdown trashy goods : The girls don't show any skin during the obligatory group shower scene ( we see plenty of bare backs and legs , but no bare breasts or buttocks ! ) , plus there's not even a hint of lesbianism and the standard sexually abusive rapist degenerate guard is notably absent . In addition , the flick abruptly switches gears after the ladies break out and turns into a heavy-handed revenge thriller . Moreover , what little violence we get is depressingly tame stuff ( even the expected catfights are nothing to get excited about ) . Jimmy Yu's surprisingly glossy and impressive cinematography manages to rise above the general ineptitude . Ricky Chan's neatly varied score - - it's a groovy mix of pounding rock , lush orchestral mush , and funky soul - - likewise is quite cool . The film also deserves some faint praise for having the audacity to cast an obvious Asian girl sporting shoe polish on her face and an Afro wig atop her head as the token brassy black babe . But overall this clunker still sizes up as a totally blah and dissatisfying lemon .
519134	8239592	28174	3.0	A real snorefest	Wimpy stuffed shirt Armand Louque ( blandly played by veteran character actor Dean Jagger in a rare lead role ) joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies . Armand falls for the lovely Claire Duval ( fetching blonde Dorothy Stone ) , who uses the meek sap to get Armand's colleague Clifford Grayson ( the hopelessly wooden Robert Noland ) to marry her . Furious over being used and spurned by Claire , Armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to get revenge . Sound exciting ? Well , it sure ain't . For starters , Victor Halperin's static ( non ) direction lets the meandering and uneventful talk-ridden story plod along at an excruciatingly slow pace . Worse yet , Halperin crucially fails to bring any tension , atmosphere and momentum to the hideously tedious proceedings . The mostly blah acting from a largely insipid cast doesn't help matters any ; only George Cleveland as the hearty General Duval and E . Alyn Warren as the irascible Dr . Trevissant manage to enliven things a bit with their welcome and refreshing hammy histrionics . The drippy stock film library score , the painfully obvious stagebound sets , and the crude cinematography are pretty lousy and unimpressive as well . In fact , this feeble excuse for a fright feature is so crummy that not even the uncredited starkly staring eyes of the great Bela Lugosi can alleviate the brain-numbing boredom . A dismally dull dud .
519223	8239592	244807	7.0	A pretty good , but flawed and occasionally tedious 70's R & B concert documentary	A cluttered , splintered and technically shabby 96 minute music documentary ragbag depicting a 15-hour special concert held in Ghana to celebrate that African country's 14th anniversary of independence . Many popular jazz and rhythm and blues artists are prominently featured herein , all of whom come through with 100 % on the money performances which are sloppily sandwiched between drably shot , sometimes interesting , but more often pretty tedious footage of tribal dances , resident talent acts which vary from authentically earthy ( the medicine man with the musical ball is simply amazing ) to slick and touristy shallow , star singers sampling Ghanaian cuisine , extensive background historical detail on the South African slave trade , a walk through dilapidated ruins , and pit stops at villages complete with excess shopping and amiable chats with locals . Luckily , the concert footage seriously cooks with high octane unleaded gas . The Staple Singers cut to the heart of the matter with the stirring workers ' rights anthem " When Will I Get Paid ? " and the rousing gospel rock number " Are You Sure ? , " while Roberta Flack wrenches the emotions with the poignant mid-tempo break-up tune " Trying Times . " The Voices of East Harlem engage in a fantastic impromptu a capella street jam and cut loose on the thrilling " Run Shaker Life . " Santana , assisted by excellent guest percussionist Willie Bobo , lay down the blistering instrumental " Jingo " before ripping away into a sensationally sensual , smoldering and spirited rendition of the great " Black Magic Woman . " Rumpled old bluesmen Les McCann and Eddie Harris do a wonderfully spontaneous beat box duet on the plane en route to the concert and team up on stage for the fine raspy-throated blues scorcher " Heyjorler . " Ike and Tina Turner deliver a positively smoking set which includes the cracked New Orleans R & B novelty gem " Ooh Poo Pah Doo , " the classic " River Deep , Mountain High , " and the especially awesome lowdown gritty blues wailer " I Smell Trouble " - - the latter highlighted by Ike's incredibly fiery protracted guitar solo . Lastly , Wilson Pickett closes the concert on an exciting note with a spectacularly incendiary version of " Land of A 1 , 000 Dances , " much to the enjoyment of a totally with-it audience . Although marred by uneven direction by Denis Sanders ( who also helmed the Big E concert picture " Elvis : That's the Way It Is " and the immortal 70's drive-in cult hoot " Invasion of the Bee Girls " ) , occasionally slack pacing , a crucial lack of narrative cohesion , Erik Daarstad's shaky cinematography ( Vilmos Zsigmund was one of the cameramen ) , and Sidney Levin's limp editing , the documentary's overall sincere tone , strong sense of time and history , the flavorsome evocation of an exotic foreign milieu , and , of course , the powerhouse strength of the concert performances make this flawed , yet still solid film well worth seeing .
519158	8239592	260221	8.0	Just say nope to dope , kids	Here's a choice cheesy chunk of laughably overwrought anti-drug scare propaganda that was actually shown to high school kids in the 60s and 70s in order to dissuade them from getting hooked on the hard stuff . Clean-cut young John ( played by future mainstream movie character actor Kevin Tighe ) begins his downward spiral into dope and despair by doing bennies and beer . Evil , shifty drug dealer Pete ( the sleazy-looking Gerald LeRoy ) gets John to start smoking pot and then next thing you know poor John is strung out on smack ! Director Mel Marshall and screenwriter Edward Brennan lay on the anti-drug message something thick in this hilariously clumsy and unsubtle unintentional laugh riot . Patrick Miller's gloomy , heavy-handed narration is especially sidesplitting with its frequent use of then hip , now hopelessly dated " groovy " slang words . The ragged editing and raw , scratchy cinematography by Jay Lovins both add immensely to the overall campy amusement of this vintage 60's class room kitsch hoot .
518696	8239592	52602	8.0	A fun little mystery thriller quickie	Feisty mystery writer Cornelia van Gorder ( superbly played by Agnes Moorehead ) rents a country house called the Oaks for the summer . A lethal criminal called the Bat terrorizes the area . Meanwhile , bank president John Fleming ( a nicely weaselly Harvey Stephens ) has embezzled a million dollars . And suave Dr . Malcom Wells ( the always terrific Vincent Price ) knows more than he's telling about what's going on . Writer / director Crane Wilber relates the compellingly twisty story at a brisk pace and effectively creates a sizable amount of tension . Joseph Biroc's sharp black and white cinematography makes artful use of dissolves and vertical wipes . Louis Forbes ' shuddery score likewise does the trick . Moorehead and Price are both wonderful in their juicy lead roles ; they receive fine support from Lenita Lane as chatty , excitable maid Lizzie Allen , Gavin Gordon as the hard-nosed Lt . Andy Anderson , John Sutton as reliable , but suspicious chauffeur Warner , and Darla Hood of the Little Rascals fame as the adorable Judy Hollander . Moreover , the masked , clawed , black-clad the Bat makes for a nifty villain ; his true identity turns out to be a genuine surprise . Witty and concise , this movie overall rates as a hugely entertaining feature .
519024	8239592	191244	8.0	An amusingly goofy Bigfoot romp	This refreshingly playful and tongue-in-cheek romp is part fact , part fiction and all enjoyable in its pleasingly facetious telling of a legendary backwoods Bigfoot who periodically pops up in the Georgia forest around an equally mythical mountain to scare the hell out of the local yokels . Klutzy middle-aged newspaper copy boy Bestoink Dooley ( winningly played by George Ellis ) , eager to nail a hot scoop , goes venturing up into the hills to find out if the stories about Mr . Out of Control Excess Body Hair have any basis in truth . Director Massey Cramer displays a light , frothy touch throughout ( Cramer co-wrote and produced the merely okay dope deal opus " The Florida Connection " ) . Joseph Shelton's sometimes sharp cinematography offers some eye-catching visuals of the eerily calm lakes and woods , plus several creepy shots of the creature prowling around the dense , fog-shrouded forest . A spooky atmosphere is effectively developed and the monster attack scenes are executed with a goodly amount of punch . Former yo-yo champion , spookshow performer , soft-core writer / director / producer and all-around extraordinary cinematic jack-of-all-trades exploitation huckster par excellence Donn Davison ( who's billed here as a " world traveler , lecturer , and psychic investigator " ) clearly shot inserts for this little killer-diller ; they were probably done for a belated 70's release in order to cash in on the then scorching hot Sasquatch craze . Davison makes for a wryly entertaining host as he cites facts about Bigfoot which include the famous Teddy Roosevelt incident and conducts droll interviews with wide-eyed folks who've had scary run-ins with the beast ( " Is this gonna be on television ? , " one awestruck gal asks Davison at the end of her interview ) . Tim York's tuneful'n'twangy country theme song " The Ballad of McCullough's Mountain " smokes in no uncertain terms ( " Some say he breathed fire like a dragon / Some say a giant ape with a human soul " ) . Okay , this silly picture sure ain't no celluloid masterpiece , but as far as Sasquatch cinema movies go it's well above average .
518113	8239592	73736	8.0	An enjoyably dippy serving of melodramatic 70's drive-in junk	Smooth hotshot lawyer Jerry Bounds ( a solid performance by Adam West of TV's " Batman " fame ) clashes with huffy and powerful rival veteran attorney Pike Smith ( a pleasingly crusty and lively portrayal by John Anderson ) over a big case involving a water company . Smith hires the sultry and enticing Londa Wyeth ( perfectly embodied by the gorgeously voluptuous Ahna Capri ) to pose as a jury member and befriend Bounds so he can be disbarred from the profession . Director / co-writer Hikmet Avedis , who also appears in the film as sleazy low-rent private eye Ace Sharkey , relates the engrossingly lurid story at a steady pace , maintains a lighthearted tone throughout , and sprinkles in a handy helping of tasty female nudity ( lovely blonde Christianne Schmidtmer has a small , yet memorable role as a nude model while Capri looks positively smashing sans clothes ) . The sturdy cast of familiar faces helps out a whole lot : Alvy Moore as the lecherous Bailiff Humbolt , Marlene Schmidt as Bounds ' concerned , supportive wife Elizabeth , Harvey Jason as Pike's laid-back swinging artist son Hardin Smith , Charles Knopp as hard-nosed Judge Davis , and Chuck Boyd as wimpy law firm head Arthur Farley . Massoud Joseph's crisp cinematography and Shorty Rogers ' get-down funky score are both up to speed . Moreover , the insanely groovy theme song sung by Lou Rawls , some amusingly dated slang ( " far out " ) , a hysterically overwrought disbarment trial , and a simply sidesplitting surprise downbeat ending all greatly add to this picture's considerable kitschy appeal . In fact , this movie often plays like an R-rated feature length 70's exploitation version of an episode of " Perry Mason . " A fun little diversion .
517983	8239592	78089	8.0	A nifty little indie sci-fi winner	I first saw and fell in love with this immensely enjoyable low-budget science fiction treat on some Saturday afternoon creature feature show . It tells the story of a motley spaceship crew who find themselves stranded on a strange and unknown planet populated by hostile and hungry dinosaurs . The intrepid bunch soon learn that they must fight back against the dinosaurs or else they will all perish . Director James K . Shea brings a winning blend of flair and energy to the fun premise ; he maintains a snappy pace throughout and stages the dinosaur attack scenes with considerable vigor . The acting is pretty hit or miss , with top thespic honors going to the hulking James Whitworth ( Papa Jupitor in the original " The Hills Have Eyes " ) as the tough take-charge Jim . Henning Schellerup's cinematography gives the picture a fairly polished look . The wonky synthesizer score by Kelly Lammers and John O'Verlin likewise does the trick . The characters are nicely drawn and engaging . But it's the impressively ambitious special effects that really add a great deal to the movie's funky charm and effectiveness : The stop-motion animation dinosaurs are totally cool , plus Jim Danforth supplies a few neat matte paintings . Although admittedly modest and rough around the edges , this film overall still makes the grade as a very lively and entertaining romp .
518494	8239592	65206	8.0	A fun late 60's evil hag horror outing	Shrewd , resourceful and formidable old battleaxe Claire Marrable ( superbly played to the icy hilt by Geraldine Page ) loses both her husband and her affluent lifestyle . Ms . Marrable moves to Arizona , starts a pine tree garden , and begins bumping off her elderly housekeepers for their life savings so she can continue living high on the hog . Ms . Marrable meets her match in her new housekeeper Alice Dimmock ( a terrific performance by the wondrous Ruth Gordon ) , a cheery , smart and resilient little firecracker who suspects that something is amiss . Director Lee H . Katzin and screenwriter Theodore Apstein expertly create a deliciously sinister atmosphere , relate the engrossing story at a steady pace , and top everything off with a wickedly funny sense of pitch-black humor . This movie further benefits from fine acting from an excellent cast : Page really sinks her teeth into her juicy evil old bat role , Gordon projects her usual winningly spunky charm as the endearingly feisty Ms . Dimmock , plus there are sturdy supporting contributions from Rosemary Forsyth as sweet young widow neighbor Harriet Vaughn , Robert Fuller as the dashing Mike Darrah , Mildred Dunnock as the timid Edna Tinsley , Joan Huntington as Ms . Marrable's bitchy niece Julia Lawson , and Peter Brandon as Julia's conniving stockbroker husband George . The very ending offers one doozy of a marvelously ironic surprise plot twist while the arid desert setting adds to the overall creepy tone . Joseph Biroc's lush , vibrant cinematography makes neat occasional elegant use of fades and dissolves . Gerald Fried's moody , shivery , string-laden score likewise hits the spooky spot . Best of all , it's a total treat to watch Page and Gordon bounce off each other as they engage in a deadly game of wit and wills . A hugely enjoyable fright feature .
519296	8239592	56510	8.0	A hugely entertaining period action romp	Brave and noble El Kabir ( a solid and engaging performance by Mark Damon ) fights for his oppressed people in Egypt against evil and pompous Roman governor Petronio ( zestfully played to the hateful hilt by Livio Lorenzon ) . Director Ferdinando Baldi , who also co-wrote the engrossing script with Franco Airaldi and Anacleto Fontini , relates the absorbing story at a steady pace , maintains a serious tone throughout , and stages both the fierce gladiatorial bouts and rough'n'ready swordfights with considerable skill and flair . This film further benefits from fine acting by a sturdy cast : Damon makes for a very charming and appealing protagonist , Lorenzon has an absolute ball as the eminently despicable Petronio , plus there are praiseworthy contributions from the lovely Scilla Gabel as brash and beautiful princess Livia , Paolo Gozlino as Petronio's wicked partner Furio , Alberto Lupo as hard-nosed Roman general Octavian , Corrado Annicelli as wise adviser Longino , and the fetching Samira Ahmed as sweet fair maiden Meroe . Bitto Albertini's crisp and lively cinematography boasts plenty of impressive sweeping panoramic shots of the vast desert landscape . Carlo Rustichelli's robust , thrilling , flavorsome score likewise hits the stirring spot . A very good and satisfying film .
519204	8239592	77895	8.0	An enjoyably lightweight piece of 70's drive-in fluff	Shy , but sweet and enticing Dina ( winningly played with infectiously perky charm by the lovely Kim Lankford ) starts her new job as a lifeguard at Malibu beach and immediately turns a lot of guys ' heads . Cool dude Bobby ( likable James Daughton ) and his funky buddy Paul ( the equally engaging Michael Luther ) befriend Dina and her spunky gal pal Sally ( the luscious Susan Player-Jarreau ) . Moreover , Bobby gets involved in a bitter rivalry with sneering brawny greaser Dugan Hicks ( essayed with mucho macho muscle by beefy biker flick regular Stephen Oliver ) . Director Robert J . Rosenthal , who also co-wrote the slight script with Celia Susan Cotelo , lets the loose and rambling narrative amble along at a leisurely pace , but does a solid job of capturing a certain amiably breezy'n'easy mellow tone . In addition , Rosenthal crams this baby with a generous smattering of tasty gratuitous female nudity , plus there's skinny-dipping , pot smoking , groovy disco dancing , hot babes in skimpy bikinis , and a bouncy soundtrack made up of roughly three catchy tunes . Better still , we even have an adorable dog with a pleasing penchant for stealing girls ' bikini tops . Popping up in neat supporting roles are the ever-yummy Tara Strohmeier as the foxy Glorianna , Flora Plumb as attractive teacher Mrs . Pickett , Roger Lawrence Pierce as the hopelessly geeky Claude , Rory Stevens as gawky hot dog stand vendor Charlie , Bruce Kimball as laid-back cop Lyle , and Bill Adler as an obnoxious vanner . Jamie Anderson's bright cinematography gives this picture a sparkling polished look . Michael Lloyd's gnarly-grinding score hits the soulful spot . All in all , this admittedly inane and immaterial nonsense makes for a pleasantly silly diversion .
518883	8239592	105242	8.0	A strong , absorbing and effectively creepy horror winner	Classy , worried Claire Ward ( the lovely Jane Sibbett ) hires smooth private detective John March ( the likable John Terry ) to find out what her secretive , obsessive husband Charles Dexter Ward ( a typically fine , intense and gripping portrayal by the always reliable Chris Sarandon ) has been doing in a remote woodland farmhouse he's secluded himself in . The pair discover much to their horror and dismay that Ward has found the key to immortality , which naturally comes at a truly terrible price . Director Dan ( " The Return of the Living Dead " ) O'Bannon , working from an intricate and intelligent script by Brent V . Friedman ( said script is based on a H . P . Lovecraft short story ) , deftly creates and sustains an arrestingly eerie and mysterious mood , keeps the pace plugging along at a steady clip , and coaxes solid performances from a sturdy cast ( Robert Romanus in particular is very engaging as March's wiseguy partner Lonnie ) . Moreover , Irv Goodnoff's glossy , graceful cinematography , Richard ( " Re-Animator " ) Band's soaring , supremely spooky score , and Todd Masters ' wonderfully grotesque creature f / x are all up to par as well . The film reaches its marvelously clammy , creepy and claustrophobic nerve-wracking zenith when March , Claire and Lonnie venture into the farmhouse basement and encounter the ghastly mistakes of Ward's previous failed experiments . Best of all , the grimly serious tone , judicious use of gore and monster effects , and gradual build-up towards a startling climax ensure that this feature works remarkably well as one hell of a fiercely unsettling scarefest . An excellent and unjustly overlooked sleeper .
518807	8239592	485774	8.0	A good'n'gory little straight-to-video horror shocker	Vicious serial killer Chambers ( a genuinely scary and intense portrayal of pure demonic evil by actor / stuntman James Binkley ) gets executed on the electric chair , but ain't down for the count just yet . Chambers comes back to ferocious and murderous life in a rundown hospital that's on the verge of closing . He naturally embarks on the expected gruesome killing spree , joyfully slaughtering both staff and patients alike while gaining additional strength by ripping the hearts out of his victims . Chambers specifically goes after Sara Wexler ( a strong and sympathetic performance by the very attractive and appealing brunette Meredith Henderson ) , a spunky , but troubled and depressed suicidal young lass he shares a special psychic bound with . Pretty soon only Sara , smartaleck teen Walter ( the likable Nathaniel Stephenson ) and feisty Nurse Grafton ( the solid Laura De Carteret ) are left to fend off the seemingly unstoppable supernatural maniac . Capably directed by make-up effects maestro Bob Keen , with slick , shadowy photography by David Mitchell , a constant snappy pace , an effectively spooky'n'shuddery score by Eric Cadesky and Nick Dyer , several grisly shock set pieces ( the sequence where Chambers blithely butchers an emergency room full of screaming and terrified folks is especially potent and unnerving ) , a suitably creepy claustrophobic atmosphere , and sound acting from a sturdy cast ( beloved genre icon Robert Englund in particular does well in a refreshing change-of-pace good guy part as a friendly , folksy sheriff ) , " Heartstopper " delivers a reasonable amount of thrills and tension as its grim and gripping story unfolds . With his big , bald head , deep , growly voice , powerful muscular build , and calmly malevolent demeanor , Chambers makes for a genuinely fearsome and imposing homicidal fiend . A good'n'gory little horror item that doesn't break any new or original ground , but still does the trick in a perfectly enjoyable and straightforward manner just the same .
518201	8239592	478188	8.0	A fun fantasy adventure flick	A commercial airliner crashes in a remote Amazon jungle . The motley group of survivors find themselves in a strange and dangerous world populated by big deadly spiders , giant scorpions , winged reptiles , killer sentient vines , a lethal native tribe , and a fearsome towering ape . Director / co-writer Leigh Scott relates the absorbing premise at a steady , snappy pace , maintains an admirably serious tone throughout , and stages the thrilling action scenes with a reasonable amount of flair . Moreover , the sturdy cast all deliver solid and spirited performances : Bruce Boxleitner as the huffy , enigmatic Lt . Challenger , Rhett Giles as the stalwart , resourceful John Roxton , Jeff Denton as the likable , sensible Ed Malone , Sarah Lieving as plucky photographer Rita Summerlee , Christina Rosenberg as fidgety , foxy California babe Dana , Chriss Anglin as nasty native tribe leader Olo , Amanda Ward as pretty stewardess Natalie , Boni Yamagisawa as feisty native girl Tianka , and Thomas Downey as the jerky Reggie . Steve Railsback contributes an especially lively turn as the deranged Larry . Steve Parker's crisp cinematography and Ralph Rieckermann's robust , rousing score are both up to speed . Plus there's a decent smidgen of gore , a dab of tasty female nudity , and a welcome absence of both pretense and cheesy oneliners . Granted , the CGI creatures are really tacky and unconvincing , but that criticism aside this flick overall sizes up as one hell of an enjoyable romp .
517980	8239592	95354	8.0	A compellingly stark and harsh allegory on human cruelty	Character actor Everett McGill gives an excellent performance in a rare substantial starring role as Oberlus , a bitter and misanthropic outcast harpooner with a grotesquely disfigured face which gives him a hideous lizard-like appearance . Oberlus is severely mistreated by his fellow sailors , so one night he escapes to a small remote island . Oberlus makes himself ruler of the island and declares war on the rest of mankind . Anyone luckless enough to wash up on the shore of this island becomes subject to Oberlus ' cruel tyranny . Cult director Monte Hellman offers an intriguing and provocative allegory on the darkest and most bestial aspects of human nature , specifically addressing how a man can be transformed into a foul and vicious monster by the inhumanity of others . McGill excels as the angry and venomous Oberlus ; he receives fine support from Fabio Testi as his mean chief tormentor Gamboa , the lovely Maru Valdivielso as the fiery , free-spirited Carmen , Joseph Culp as whiny intellectual Dominic , Michael Madsen as the cowed Sebastian , and Jack Taylor as a stern ship captain . Josep M . Civit's bright , crisp cinematography , Franco Campanino's haunting score ( the ending credits theme song sung by Joni Mitchell is truly beautiful ) , and the poignant ending further add to the overall hypnotic power of this offbeat and interesting item .
519073	8239592	260492	8.0	A compellingly stark and sordid depiction of the 60's New York gay bath house scene	Awkward young gay man Thomas ( an engagingly gawky performance by Gerard Jacuzzo ) goes to a bath house and encounters a diverse array of homosexual guys . Thomas strikes up a rapport with the friendly , but frustrated and unhappily married Mr . Jaffee ( superbly played with riveting gravitas by Robert Dahdah ) . Andy Milligan , working from a sharp , bold , incisive script by Hope Stansbury , does an expert job of creating and sustaining an arrestingly gritty and seedy atmosphere while delivering a rough-around-the-edges , yet touching and compassionate cinematic meditation on loneliness and the basic human need for direct emotional contact . This movie boasts several poignant and powerful moments , with Mr . Jaffee's sad monologue about the tragic untimely drowning death of his son rating as a positively gut-wrenching highlight . The first-rate naturalistic acting from a uniformly tip-top cast qualifies as another significant asset : Jacuzzo and Dahdah are outstanding in the leads , with fine support from Hal Borske as the bitter , spiteful Mavis , Hal Sherwood as the effeminate Miss Parrish , Richard Goldberger as the catty Thumbelina , and Ron Keith as an aggressive seducer . Milligan's raw and grainy 16mm black and white hand-held cinematography further adds to the jolting impact and immediacy of this intriguing short feature . Proof positive that Andy Milligan could make a genuinely good picture when given the right material to work with .
518975	8239592	96152	8.0	An excellent and underrated late 80's witchcraft horror sleeper	One of my all-time favorite late 80's horror mystery thriller sleepers , this nifty little flick plays like a modestly budgeted " Fatal Attraction " crossed with " Rosemary's Baby . " Handsome nice guy Los Angeles lawyer Jeff Mills ( appealingly essayed by Timothy Daly ) saves the beautiful and enigmatic Miranda ( a strikingly sexy and mesmerizing Kelly Preston ) from a knife-wielding creep ( the astonishingly ugly and unnerving Anthony Crivello ) in a gymnasium parking lot . Jeff and Miranda immediately fall in love , finding happiness with each other . Unfortunately for them , Miranda turns out to be an honest-to-goodness witch who defected from a sinister coven that's keen on getting her back so she can be used as a sacrifice for the spring solstice . Director Janet Greek wisely allows the story to initially unfold at a leisurely pace , firmly grounding said plot in a nicely delineated everyday world which makes the supernatural aspects of the story seem plausible and thus all the more effectively scary . The performances are uniformly excellent , with especially solid turns by Rick Rossovich ( who got tossed through a wall by future California governor Arnold Schwarzeneggar in " The Terminator " ) as Jeff's best friend , Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as a hard-nosed police detective , the always delightful Diana Bellamy as Jeff's motherly , concerned secretary , M . C . Gainey as a paranoid wacko survivalist loner , and veteran thespians Audra Lindley and Stefan Gierasch as elderly members of the creepy coven . Moreover , Basil Poledouris supplies a splendidly spooky'n'shuddery score , the suspense steadily mounts as the movie progresses towards its harrowing conclusion , the slick cinematography gives the picture a glitteringly smooth and polished visual sheen , and Tracy Torme's clever script comes complete with a genuinely jolting socko surprise climactic twist .
518428	8239592	289858	8.0	An amusingly silly hoot	Sweet , but fat , shy and homely teenager Phyllis Loden ( an endearingly gawky performance by Rhona Brody ) gets entered into a high school beauty pageant by a quartet of nasty girls . Phyllis not only loses the pageant , but also gets ruthlessly picked on and publicly humiliated by the other more pretty and popular participants . Worse yet , her cruel competitors even kill Loden's beloved cat by sticking the cute little kitty in a microwave oven ! Phyllis exacts a harsh revenge by killing the evil and venomous bitches . Director / co-writer Jill Zurborg concocts an entertaining black farce that's greatly enlivened by an appealingly giddy sense of dark humor , a reasonable smidgen of gore , outrageously broad characters , and a catchy soundtrack . Moreover , the enthusiastic acting from a game no-name cast qualifies as a major plus , with especially stand-out turns by Kathryn A . Mensik as the vicious , stuck-up Muffy Fairlane , Steve Kollin as Loden's nerdy bespectacled sole friend Cameron , Tammy Pescatelli as the snarky Elizabeth McKay , Jim Boggess as snooty pageant chairwoman Betty Prunish , Kimberly Ann Kurtenbach as the vacuous Alison Murphy , Laura Schutter as the antsy Shelley Styles , Matthew Speak as jerky jock Paul Whitewater , and Peter Soderberg as dogged private detective Dick Richards . Jeff Carney's competent cinematography and Dana P . Rowe's bouncy score are both up to speed . Granted , at almost two hours this movie does drag quite a bit here and there , but overall it's a funny and enjoyable romp .
518126	8239592	83168	8.0	An unusual and interesting oddity	A then unknown pre-Prince Vanity stars in this outrageously campy , sexy and compelling " Beauty and the Beast " - type allegorical oddity as Tanya , a naive , but gorgeous and hence quite desirable aspiring young actress who has a nightmare that both she and her possessive , overbearing , sadistic older painter boyfriend Lobo ( excellently played to vile perfection by Richard Sargent ) are living together on a peaceful and tropical isolated island . Tanya befriends a gentle , turquoise-eyed huge gorilla whom she names Blue ( persuasively portrayed by Don McCloud in an amazingly credible costume ) . The ensuing platonic relationship raises the bitter and jealous ire of Lobo , who degenerates into complete base savagery as he competes with Blue to be the sole object of Tanya's affection . Well directed by Alfred Sole ( who also gave us the terrific , vehemently anti-Catholic horror knockout " Alice , Sweet Alice " ) , with exquisitely lush cinematography by Mark Irwin , a lovely , lulling and melodic score by Jean Musy , a provocative subtext which incisively explores the fine line distinguishing man from beast , a strikingly authentic ape suit that was designed by Rick Baker and Rob Bottin , and ample shots of the delectable Vanity prancing about in her birthday suit , this offbeat low-budget outing overall rates as an intriguing curio .
518711	8239592	65692	8.0	A strikingly original and compelling experimental oddity	In the late 60's up until the late 70's Stacy Keach appeared with pleasing regularity in a sizable volume of seriously offbeat try-and-do-whatever defiantly unconventional and noncommercial oddball indie movies . These pictures include John Huston's beautifully downbeat " Fat City , " the gloomy dope addict feature " Watched , " the wonderfully outré " The Ninth Configuration , " Jack Starrett's delightfully giddy'n'quirky crime romp " The Dion Brothers , " and this truly idiosyncratic cinematic marvel of deeply depressed late 60's anarchy , disillusionment and spiritual malaise , which is arguably the strangest of the whole kooky bunch . Keach delivers a typically all-out loopy performance that's all fried nerves , eroding mental stability and spaced-out behavior as Jack Horner , a recent dejected college graduate who seeks psychological help from wacko unorthodox maverick shrink Doctor D ( an extraordinarily nutty turn by a bearded , slender James Earl Jones ) . Doctor D encourages Jack to " do his own thing , " a treatment which prompts Jack to get a job at a college as an English professor . Pretty soon Jack is having an adulteress fling with the neglected unhappy wife ( superbly played by Dorothy Tristan ) of a crazed , pompous colleague ( marvelously essayed to smug , callous perfection by Harris Yulin in his film debut ) , a precarious situation which begets tragic consequences for all concerned . Addressing such pertinent topics as loss of identity , commonplace violence in contemporary society , abortion , drug use , infidelity , insanity and the sheer lunacy and bleak emptiness of middle class American existence with a bracing and fiercely pointed sense of sardonic humor , this grim social satire that was co-written by Terry Southern and garishly shot by Gordon Willis never lets up on its nihilistic , everything's-going-to-hell acid-soaked tone , thus making for a properly harsh , often funny and frequently provocative ridicule of trippy uninhibited 60's excess and messed-upness .
519180	8239592	53219	8.0	An entertaining sequel to the classic original	Late scientist Andre Delambre's ambitious son Philippe ( a solid and sympathetic performance by the handsome Brett Halsey ) decides to continue his father's experiments with teleportation . His worried uncle Francois ( the always superb Vincent Price ) disapproves . Philippe gets betrayed by his treacherous assistant Ronald Holmes ( a pleasingly slimy turn by David Frankham ) , who turns poor Philippe into a grotesque half-man , half-fly hybrid creature . Writer / director Edward Bernds eschews the heart-wrenching pathos of the first picture in favor of a less subtle , but still enjoyably lurid crime noir sensibility . The good acting from an able cast helps a lot : Halsey does impressive work in the lead , Price makes a welcome return , plus there are praiseworthy contributions by Dan Seymour as sleazy fat hoodlum Max Berthold , John Sutton as the helpful Inspector Beechum , the luscious Danielle De Metz as Philippe's charming and comely fiancé Cecile Bonnard , and Janine Grandel as loyal housekeeper Madame Bonnard . Brydon Baker's crisp black and white widescreen cinematography gives the movie an effectively gritty look . The moody , rousing score by Paul Sawtell and Bert Shefter likewise does the trick . The mutated fly-man is genuinely creepy . One definite skin-crawling highlight occurs when Holmes crosses a luckless police officer with a guinea pig ( Holmes actually crushes said squealing guinea pig with shockingly sadistic relish ! ) . Nice , pulpy fun .
517916	8239592	83017	8.0	Oh those naughty Nazis !	Loyal , fanatical and ambitious SS officer Hans Schellenberg ( a perfectly slimy and over-the-top crazed portrayal by Gabriele Carrara ) is assigned by General Berger ( a fine Ivano Stacioli ) to find traitors who exist amidst the top echelon of the Third Reich . Hans gathers together ten beautiful whores to accomplish this particular daunting task . The lovely ladies are taught all the tricks of the trade by the classy Madame Eva ( the luscious Macha Magall ) , the cruel Frau Inge ( a marvelously venomous Marina Daunia ) , and the equally vicious Professor Jurgen ( a pleasingly wicked performance by Luciano Pigozzi ) . The harlots learn everything from ballet to fencing to weight lifting to the proper way to brandish a machine gun . Then they are sent out to seduce various lecherous high-ranking Nazi officers and get them to confess about any plans they may be plotting against Hitler . Director / co-writer Bruno Mattei loads this gloriously raunchy and ridiculous Nazisploitation junk with lots of tasty distaff nudity , sizzling soft-core sex , a rousing bloodbath conclusion , more nudity , several stirring action scenes , a cheerfully sordid tone , and still more nudity . Better still , we've got all kinds of blithely kinky and depraved carnal activity on display : lesbianism , bondage , one lass does just what you think with a grotesquely malformed hunchbacked freak , voyeurism , sadomasochism , and even bestiality ( a prostitute engages in coitus with a German Shepherd ! ) . Emilio Giannini's glossy cinematography , Gianni Marchetti's bubbly , jaunty score , and a positively infectious sense of joyfully unbridled decadence further add to the overall sleazy fun of this deliciously trashy Italian grindhouse treat .
519160	8239592	91680	8.0	A total gut-busting riot	Affable aspiring cartoonist Hoops McCann ( a wonderfully engaging performance by John Cusack ) and his best buddy George ( the deliciously deadpan Joel Murray ) go to Nantucket for the summer following graduation from high school . Hoops , George , and several newfound pals come to the aid of Cassandra ( Demi Moore at her most charming ) , a singer who's family house is being threatened with demolition by the greedy Beckersted clan . Writer / director Savage Steve Holland offers an often hilariously wacky and zesty nonstop barrage of admittedly broad and dumb , but still very funny jokes . The constant madcap lunacy has a real giddy , good-natured and infectiously inane vitality to it that's impossible to either dislike or resist . Moreover , the lively and enthusiastic acting from a fine game cast adds immensely to the zany merriment : Bobcat Goldthwait as the spastic Egg Stork , Tom Villard as his goofy brother Clay , Curtis Armstrong as the sweet Ack Ack Raymond , Mark Metcalf as evil rich jerk Aquilla Beckersted , Matt Mulhern as the mean Teddy , Kimberly Foster as the fetching Cookie , Joe Flaherty as the gung-ho General Raymond , William Hickey as cranky Old Man Beckersted , Jeremy Piven as smug preppy bully Ty , and John Matuszak as hulking biker Stan . Isidore Mankofsky's slick cinematography , the hip thrashy soundtrack , Cory Lerios ' cool rockin ' score , and the funky animation are all uniformly excellent . Single funniest scene : Egg in a Godzilla suit terrorizing a posh dinner party . An absolute hoot .
518762	8239592	47559	8.0	A nifty 50's low-budget sci-fi alien invasion flick	A major American city gets evacuated because of an impending alien invasion . A motley assortment of six desperate people - - shrewd , dashing Richard Denning , feisty , but lonely and depressed Kathleen Crowley , raucous drunk Richard Reeves , Reeves ' brassy dame main flame Virginia Grey , antsy , panicky paranoid Mort Marshall and dangerous , volatile wanted fugitive criminal Robert Rourk - - are accidentally left behind and have to fend off the aliens by themselves . Sherman A . Rose's tight , sturdy , no-frills direction , working from a clever and arresting script by Bill Raynor , James Nicholson and Wyott Ordung , starts the movie out on a strong note , with a beautifully eerie and enigmatic atmosphere and exquisitely desolate shots of unnervingly empty and abandoned city streets . Alas , the feature falls a bit flat when the aliens materialize , mainly because said aliens are clunky-looking box-like waddling robots which prove to be more laughable than menacing . However , the uniformly solid acting ( longtime favorite 50's sci-fi picture perennial Whit Bissell in particular acquits himself well in a sizable supporting role as a helpful scientist ) , Guy Roe's gorgeously crisp black and white cinematography , the compelling characters , the commendably serious , no-kidding tone , Paul Dunlap's booming , robust , spooky score , the intriguing premise and the pleasingly trim 75 minute running time all keep this film on a steady and satisfying course throughout . A really fun and neat little B item .
517906	8239592	95924	8.0	Nifty little late 80's sci-fi / horror sleeper	Young boy David ( a winning performance by Joey Lawrence of the TV show " Blossom " ) is spending the week with his estranged , hard-working father Bill ( the always solid Cliff De Young ) and new stepmother Ellen ( a fine Roxanne Hart ) . David notices that the electricity in the house has taken on a lethal and malevolent life of its own , but can't convince either his dad or stepmom that something's amiss . Writer / director Paul Golding makes this fantastic premise seem fairly credible and extremely chilling by carefully evoking a thoroughly plausible everyday mundane world that's ripped violently asunder by a bizarre and inexplicable phenomenon ( Golding's stubborn refusal to provide some kind of valid explanation for why the electricity is acting up adds a truly eerie and unnerving ambiguity to the picture ) . Moreover , Golding successfully creates believable and sympathetic characters and offers a gradual build-up of skin-crawling tension which culminates in a positively harrowing and nerve-wracking climax with all the electricity going dangerously haywire . Peter Lyons Collister's exceptional macro photography , Jay Ferguson's shuddery score , and the first-rate special effects further contribute to the film's sterling quality . Kudos are also in order for the uniformly ace acting ; veteran character actor Charles Tyner has a colorfully quirky supporting part as a nutty old paranoid electrician and Robert Romanus ( Mike Damone in " Fast Times at Ridgemont High " ) pops up in a cool cameo as a smooth-talking TV repairman . Spooky and intense , " Pulse " rates as a real nifty little sci-fi / horror sleeper .
518319	8239592	74729	8.0	A nice'n'slimy serving of nasty Italian Nazisploitation sleaze	Compassionate Maria Black ( well played by the lovely Lorraine De Salle ) is forced to work as a medical assistant at a Nazi concentration camp and witnesses firsthand the various brutal and inhumane scientific experiments being conducted by the Third Reich at the place . Director / co-writer Bruno Mattei delivers the lowdown harsh , grimy and appalling goods in an unflinchingly graphic and upsetting manner : Among the foul stuff to relish herein are naked women being severely whipped , a lady have her uterus surgically removed so it can be transplanted in a sterile woman , ladies being put to death in a gas chamber , a frozen guy getting revived by the sexual body heat of a hot nude prostitute ( he of course then makes love to said hooker ! ) , an unsuccessful attempt at curing gay men of their homosexuality , one poor gal slowly dying after being shot with a poisoned bullet , and several vile rapes . Moreover , we also get some lesbianism , a catfight , and plenty of full frontal female nudity . The despicable Nazi swine villains make for a memorably hateful rogues ' gallery : Ivano Staccioli as the cruel , unhinged Commander Wieker , Ria De Simone as the predatory chief capo Marta , Giovanni Attanasio as the bald , cackling , depraved cretin Kurt , and Gabriele Carrara as the sadistic Oberleutnant Otto Ohlendorff . Sonia Viviani contributes a solid supporting performance as fetching and fragile female prisoner Cristina . Alessandro Alessandroni's moody , shivery score , the grim , humorless tone , Luigi Ciccarese's slick , yet grotty and washed-out cinematography , and the uncompromisingly downbeat bummer ending all further enhance the unsparingly bleak and depressing atmosphere of this perfectly ugly and offensive piece of deplorable trash .
517984	8239592	299988	8.0	A surprisingly solid and enjoyable belated sequel	Still severely traumatized by his near fatal run-in with deranged roving serial killer John Ryder , Jim Halsey ( ably reprised by C . Thomas Howell ) decides to surmount his demons by returning back to the lonely stretch of West Texas backroads where the initial agonizing ordeal occurred . Jim's gutsy and loving girlfriend Maggie ( an engagingly feisty Kari Wuhrer ) tags along for moral support . The pair encounter another shrewd psychotic hitchhiker named Jack ( essayed with marvelously maniacal relish by Jake Busey ) , who naturally proceeds to put Jim and Maggie through absolute nerve-shredding bloody hell . This belated straight-to-video follow-up turns out to be a surprisingly solid , suspenseful and satisfying sequel : It's directed with style and gusto to burn by Louis Morneau ( who previously scored with the superlative " Retroactive " ) , acted with comparable aplomb by the entire cast , with sumptuously adept , gliding , sinuous cinematography by George Mooradian , a bracingly swift rat-a-tat-tat pace that never drags for a second , a shivery , pile-driving score by Joe Kraemer , a considerable amount of gut-ripping tension , a sharply sardonic sense of humor , and a hair-raising lump-in-your-throat shoot-the-fireworks bravura action finale . A surefire winner that almost matches the sterling quality of the simply astonishing original , this honey's a whole lot better than expected and definitely worth checking out .
519245	8239592	83296	8.0	Michael Ironside makes for a memorably nasty and scary psycho in this underrated early 80's Canadian woman-in-jeopardy thriller	Vicious misogynistic psycho par excellence Colt Hawker ( a truly chilling and convincing portrayal of seething brutality by the always intense and effective Michael Ironside , who's positively terrifying in a substantial full-blown villain role ) assaults feisty and outspoken feminist TV reporter Deborah Ballin ( a fine Lee Grant ) in her home after she delivers a scathing put-down of male chauvinism on live television . The badly wounded Ballin barely survives the attack and gets taken to a nearby hospital to be treated for her injuries . Hawker follows Ballin there so he can continue his relentless campaign of terror against her . Director Jean-Claude ( " The Vindicator " ) Lord keeps the film mostly tight and suspenseful throughout , delivering one jolting shock after another until the movie culminates in a harrowing showdown between the two bitter adversaries . Lord strives for gritty realism and generally succeeds with this goal , adeptly creating a hard , rough and above all pretty plausible edge which in turn makes the unflinchingly ugly and sadistic violence that much more potent and disturbing . Moreover , Linda Purl offers strong support as a sympathetic nurse ( the sequence where Ironside assaults Purl in her house is genuinely bloodcurdling ) while both Harvey ( " Meatballs " ) Atkin and Helen ( " Incubus , " " Blue Monkey " ) Hughes pop up as two of Hawker's unfortunate victims . On the debit side the rather drawn-out 105 minute running time causes the picture to drag in spots and the usually more manic William Shatner is strangely subdued and soporific as Ballin's insufferably insipid stuffed shirt of a boss . Unjustly ridiculed by a majority of critics when it was first released and often erroneously tagged as just another mindless hack ' em up slasher item ( which it most certainly isn't ) , " Visiting Hours " rates highly as a smart , gripping and overall superior thriller that's much better than its unfairly lousy reputation would suggest .
518679	8239592	57242	8.0	An excellent and unjustly overlooked early 60's Cold War era drama sleeper	This extremely chilling and quietly powerful early 60's doomsday drama benefits substantially from Frank Perry's intelligent , understated direction , Eleanor Perry's equally smart and perceptive script , and the uniformly outstanding acting from an exceptional mostly kid cast . An alarm signifying an imminent nuclear bombing sounds off at a remote rural school . The school's principal ( future " St . Elsewhere " TV series regular William Daniels in his fine film debut ) has the teachers walk all the students home so they can seek shelter from the fall-out in the cellars of their parents ' homes . One obnoxiously bratty and overbearing girl allows five other kids to reside in her parents ' shelter , but refuses to let another girl she doesn't like in . This selfish action begets tragic consequences . The serious and starkly realistic tone vividly evokes the pervasive unease and paranoia of early 60's Cold War era America , the gradually mounting tension thankfully eschews hysterics in favor of a more organic and restrained feeling of encroaching dread , the assorted kids ' reactions are totally plausible and astutely observed ( the older ones instantly become aware of how awful the impending blast is while the younger tykes are blissfully ignorant of the whole crushing ordeal ) , and the ingenious ploy of having children face up to a situation of overwhelming gravity on their own gives the overall movie an intimate and very gut-wrenching emotional immediacy that's believable , engrossing , and ultimately quite devastating ( the downbeat ending in particular packs a strong and lingering punch ) . Inspired by actual events , this unjustly neglected sleeper deserves to be a lot better known .
519153	8239592	69850	8.0	An enjoyable slice of giallo Eurotrash fun	A vicious killer brutally bumps off prostitutes at a swanky Paris bordello run by the stern Madame Colette ( the lovely Anita Ekberg ) . The hard-boiled Inspector Pontaine ( an amusing performance by Humphrey Bogart impersonator Robert Sacchi ) investigates the murders . Propable suspects include the hot-headed Antoine Gottvalles ( moody Peter Martell ) , smarmy nightclub owner Pepi ( slimy Rolf Eden ) , and sinister Professor Waldemar ( Jess Franco film regular Howard Vernon ) . Director Ferdinando Merighi maintains a snappy pace throughout as well as delivers a smattering of sleazy soft-core sex , a sprinkling of tasty gratuitous female nudity , and a few dollops of tacky gore ( a couple of cheesy decapitations rate as the definite splatter highlights ) . Moreover , Merighi stages the grisly murder set pieces with deliciously garish psychedelic stylistic aplomb . The always welcome and enticing presences of beautiful cult Eurobabe starlets Barbara ( " Don't Torture A Duckling " ) Bouchet , Rosalba ( " The Arena " ) Neri , and Evelyn ( " The Mighty Peking Man " ) Kraft qualifies as another substantial asset . The polished cinematography by Mario Mancini and Gunter Otto makes nifty occasional use of a hand-held camera . Bruno Nicolai's pretty and melodic , yet groovy and jazzy score really hits the funky spot . Italian peblum muscleman star Gordon Mitchell pops up in a bit part as a nightclub patron . Good , trashy fun .
517912	8239592	86967	8.0	An enjoyably crummy earthbound " Alien " rip-off by the ever-reliable Fred Olen Ray	An entertaining , incredibly idiotic , and basically all-thumbs mid-80's earthbound " Alien " clone from the forever fumble-fingered Grade D dreckmonger Fred Olen Ray , who once again shows off his characteristic consummate ineptitude and flagrant disregard for anything remotely resembling professional film-making . Besides an obviously inebriated Aldo Ray delivering one of his single most horrendous performances as an irascible , constantly tongue-tied army general , Fred's then five-year-old son Christopher shambling about in a pitifully unconvincing rubber monster suit , a hilarious rockabilly ending credits theme song called " Rockabilly Rumble " performed by Johnny Legend and the Skullcaps , and plenty of Fred's patented crappy touches ( dreadful acting , some bloody , but phony gore , excruciatingly labored attempts at no-brainer lowbrow humor , a little gratuitous bare female skin , a smug smartaleck attitude which suggests that Ray might be churning out these cheapie clunkers strictly for the money , and dimly lit nighttime cinematography that's guaranteed to make you blurry-eyed ) , the key reason to give this supremely shoddy stinker a look-see is to watch remarkably buxom erstwhile porn actress Angelique Pettyjohn show off her amazingly ample breasts in a couple of almost literally eye-popping scenes . Now , what more could you possibly ask for in an admittedly el zilcho two-cent " Alien " rip-off ? Well , how about Fred in a quick cameo along with fellow partner - in - schlocky - celluloid - crime Donald G . Jackson ( he who blessed us with " Hell Comes to Frogtown " ) as a medic . Best and funniest moment : When the irate dwarf creature shreds an " E . T . " poster and stomps all over it in an angry jealous rage ! A deliciously cheesy hoot and a half .
518800	8239592	833098	8.0	A very bleak and disturbing little shocker	A strange and lethal virus causes men to go insane and savagely murder women in a psychotic fit of religious fervor whenever they are sexually aroused . Scientists Alan ( an engaging performance by Jason Priestley ) and Barney ( the always excellent Elliott Gould ) try to find a cure while Alan's feisty wife Anne ( well played by the lovely Kerry Norton ) and spunky daughter Amy ( the solid Brenna O'Brien ) flee to the woods of Canada where it's still safe . Director Joe Dante , working from a bold and biting by Sam Hamm , delivers a chilling mix of stinging social commentary and unsettling doomsday end-of-the-world thriller that offers plenty of spot-on incisive stuff about religious fanaticism run dangerously amok , misogynistic male violence against women , and how mankind's own self-destructive nature will eventually turn on him . Moreover , Dante relates the gripping story at a snappy pace , maintains a grimly serious tone throughout , stages the jolting moments of brutal violence with unflinching explicitness ( an alarming psychotic outburst in a strip club is especially potent and upsetting ) , and adds a wickedly amusing line in pitch-black humor to further spice up the already tasty brew . Hummie Mann's spooky'n'shivery score and Attila Szalay's glossy , intimate cinematography are both top-notch . The acting is uniformly sound as well , with Linda Darlow a stand-out as sarcastic epidemiologist Bella . The surprise twist ending packs quite a punch . A praiseworthy sci-fi / horror winner .
518329	8239592	385218	8.0	A hilariously ridiculous cheesy hoot	A bunch of sadistic college frat jerks tie fragile diabetic Sam ( scrawny Caleb Roehrig ) to a cross in a corn field . Sam nearly dies and subsequently resurrects a lethal evil scarecrow ( hulking Steve Worley ) who proceeds to brutally butcher a handful of party hearty kids frolicking on the beach during spring break . It's up to token nice guy Jack ( affable Matthew Linhart ) and his sweet girlfriend Beth ( luscious Samantha Aisling ) to stop the scarecrow before it's too late . Writer / director Brian Katlin concocts one uproariously ludicrous excuse for a horror flick : we've got crummy acting from a lame no-name cast ( Ken Shamrock is especially terrible as ramrod Coach Ramsey ) , a roaring soundtrack of silly rock songs , a few dumb false scares , largely obnoxious and unlikable characters , glaring day-for-night continuity errors aplenty , one dude belts out a horrendous acoustic ballad around a campfire , a protracted volleyball game , a handy helping of tasty gore ( an impalement on a bamboo pole rates as the definite gruesome highlight ) , and a ham-fisted ending that tries for tragic pathos ( ! ) . The scarecrow makes for a truly laughable monster : he lumbers about in broad daylight , whistles off-key , and even runs over a hapless lass with a pick-up truck . Zoran Popovic's bright , sunny , shaky cinematography , Collin Simon's generic ooga-booga spooky score , and several hot chicks in skimpy bikinis further enhance the campy fun . As an added bonus , both busty blonde Lisa Robert and cute brunette Tara Platt bare their breasts . An enjoyably tacky kitsch hoot .
519172	8239592	78924	8.0	The Bionic Benji , or , the Six Million Dollar Mutt	Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster ( a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV's " Land of the Lost " ) creates a computerized watchdog called C . H . O . M . P . S . ( an acronym for Canine Home Protection System ) for his boss Mr . Ralph Norton ( nicely played by Conrad Baain ) , whose home security business is floundering . A rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their grubby hands on C . H . O . M . P . S . ; said task proves to be easier said than done . Director Don Chaffey relates the endearingly dopey story at a constant brisk pace , maintains an amiably silly and lighthearted tone throughout , and stages the goofy slapstick gags with considerable flair . Moreover , the game cast mug it up with infectious aplomb : the adorable Valerie Bertinelli as Brian's sweet fiancé Casey Norton , Chuck McCann as klutzy crook Brooks , Red Buttons as McCann's equally bumbling partner Bracken , Jim Backus as evil CEO Mr . Gibbs , Hermoine Baddeley as nice old biddy Ms . Foster , and 60's AIP exploitation feature regular Larry Bishop as smarmy , duplicitous suit Ken Sharp . Best of all , the titular pooch is a cuddly delight : C . H . O . M . P . S . jumps through fences , walls and windows with amazing agility , performs acts of exceptional strength , runs faster than a deer , and even does a few nifty martial arts moves . A subplot about a hulking neighborhood hound named Monster supplies a few extra belly laughs ( Monster is voiced by some uncredited guy with an appropriately deep , growly voice ) . The groovy animated opening credits sequence , Charles F . Wheeler's glossy cinematography , and Hoyt Curtin's funky , pulsating disco score are all solid as well . A cute little kiddie flick .
517947	8239592	281048	8.0	An eerie and interesting Indonesian supernatural horror shocker	Poor teenager Tommy isn't having a good time of it . His mother just passed away at a tragically young age . Tommy starts seeing a ghostly white apparition of her unrestful spirit . He also experiences scary nightmares of an evil devil cult . Plus a couple of close friends of the family meet brutal untimely ends . Could it be mysterious new housekeeper Darminah who's behind the freaky and troubling events that have befallen Tommy and his family ? Director Sisworo Gautama Putra does an expert job of ably creating and sustaining a powerfully eerie and unnerving otherworldly atmosphere . Moreover , Putra does a totally convincing job of evoking a thoroughly believable mundane everyday reality that's ripped asunder by bizarre and inexplicable supernatural phenomenon . Better still , Putra keeps the pace slow , yet steady throughout , uses violence in a shocking , but restrained manner and gradually builds up a tremendous amount of harrowing tension before pulling out all the stops with a genuinely terrifying conclusion in which all hell quite literally breaks lose . This film even offers a rich , colorful and illuminating depiction of a fascinatingly different culture and its strongly held religious beliefs . An extremely solid and satisfying foreign fright feature .
518467	8239592	71318	8.0	A very creepy and effective little 70's B sci-fi / horror flick	How's this for a really inspired and effective handy-dandy sci-fi / horror combo premise : Let's take your basic randomly selected motley assortment of everyday folks gathered together in a deep , isolated , self-contained underground nuclear fall-out shelter so they can survive an impending end-of-the-world holocaust tale and embellish on this standard situation with a borrowing from the then hip killer-animals-run-amuck trend by having a horde of vicious , relentless , chattering vampire bats with a taste for human blood attack the understandably terrified bunch at regular bloodcurdling intervals . Sounds like a pretty desperately reaching " high concept " effort , right ? Well , that brusque blow-off assumption is wrong . Dead wrong . Under episodic TV show vet Sutton Roley's taut , capable direction the admittedly threadbare story works surprisingly well , resulting in a genuinely scary , creepy and suspenseful nail-biter . The neatly varied cast helps a lot ; they fill out their stock roles with commendable conviction . Former child actor Jackie Cooper portrays a cross , feet-of-clay rich jerk grumbler with stand-out sliminess . Constantly reliable B-pic perennials Richard Jaeckel ( who later had a fatal run-in with a killer bear in " Grizzly " and got offed by a pack of wild dogs in " Day of the Animals " ) and Alex Cord ( the latter bears a passing resemblance to tough guy thesp extraordinaire William Smith here ) make for properly stalwart heroes . The always composed and elegant Diana Muldaur brings a welcome touch of class to the tense , grisly proceedings . Future " Hill Street Blues " regular Barbara Babcock is a lovely damsel in distress . A bespectacled Bradford Dillman ( who went on to get stung to death by killer bees in " The Swarm " and had his face nibbled on by carnivorous fish in " Piranha " ) nerds it up nicely as a duplicitous dweeby scientist . Chronically unsung character actors Pedro Armendariz , Jr . and Lincoln Kilpatrick contribute solid performances as an eminently expendable decent dude and a gallant , rugged Olympic athlete , respectively . The sequence where Kilpatrick tries to climb out of the subterranean shelter on a rope is both gripping and nerve-wracking . The bat attacks are almost unbearably frightening and ferocious . The claustrophobic set design , Gabriel Torres ' cramped , closed-in cinematography , Fred Karlin's jazzy , spooky score , the unremittingly eerie tone , and the bleakly ironic ending all add considerably to the gut-wrenching tension . And those nasty screeching bats are truly horrifying little suckers !
518024	8239592	140174	8.0	Beware the deadly dweeb in the delivery van !	I absolutely love this delectably cheap'n'cheesy late 60's exploitation trash psycho howler . Hopelessly geeky bespectacled dweeb Howard ( a hilariously histrionic performance by Robert Gribbin , who overemotes to the point where you swear he's going to give himself a nosebleed ) drives a delivery van for the local laundromat service . Howard has gone murderously around the bend ever since his beloved sister ran away from home six years ago . While making his daily rounds Howard picks up stray runaway teenage lady hitch-hikers and brutally butchers them . Among Howard's victims are a token gay guy , a little girl whose bloodied corpse Howard leaves in a dumpster , and one luckless lass Howard strangles in the back of his van with a wire coat hanger ( I'm sure Joan Crawford would have approved of this last one ) . Earnest , but ineffectual police captain Shaw ( well essayed by Russell Johnson ; the Professor on " Gilligan's Island " ! ) tries to catch Howard , but thanks to indifferent and negligent parents finds this to be a most difficult task to accomplish ( nice pointed social commentary here ) . Not released for ten years until it was picked up by legendary soft-core flick king Harry Novak's Box Office International Pictures for theatrical distribution in the 70's , sporting suitably shoddy production values , largely atrocious acting ( the scenes where Howard either experiences painful seizures or erupts into a wildly raving psychotic frenzy while killing folks are especially sidesplitting ) , and a gloriously ghastly country-and-western theme song ( " Danger on the road / Danger on the road / There's no way you can tell / When you hitch-hike to hell / Danger on the road tonight " ) , this grubby grindhouse gem is well worth picking up if you're a fan of deliciously down'n'dirty drive-in dreck .
519280	8239592	51434	8.0	An enjoyably odd picture	Rugged big game hunter Dan Fuller ( a solid and likable performance by Lance Fuller ) discovers much to his dismay that his lovely new bride Laura ( a nicely sexy portrayal by fetching brunette Charlotte Austin ) has a most troubling and peculiar affinity for gorillas . Dan is forced to shoot his pet ape Spanky ( Steve Calvert in a funky suit ) dead after the big brute breaks free from his basement cage and goes after Laura . Dan takes Laura with him on a safari to Africa . The expedition not only runs afoul of two lethal tigers , but also a couple of hulking gorillas who abduct Laura . Director Adrian Weiss milks plenty of compellingly aberrant thrills from the typically outlandish script by the notorious Ed Wood , Jr . : Weiss treats the weird and perverse premise with admirable seriousness , relates the gloriously wacky story at a steady pace , and concludes things on a bravely downbeat note . Naturally , Wood's script features the inevitable reference to angora sweaters and incorporates a pretty far-fetched reincarnation theme into the already heady mix ( Laura was a gorilla in a previous life ! ) . Kudos are in order for the surprisingly sound and sincere acting by sterling leads Fuller and Austin ; they receive sturdy support from Johnny Roth as loyal native houseboy Taro and William Justine as helpful psychiatrist Dr . Carl Reiner . The scenes with the savage tigers attacking people are staged with rousing aplomb . Roland Price's sharp black and white cinematography and Les Baxter's sweeping orchestral score are both up to par . A pleasingly offbeat and unusual little oddity .
518143	8239592	105690	8.0	An infectiously absurd escapist action hoot	A vicious band of terrorist hijackers lead by bitter and vengeful covert operative William Stranix ( the always fine Tommy Lee Jones in peak wicked form ) take over a Navy battleship in order to get their evil hands on an arsenal of nuclear missiles . It's up to cynical and disgraced former Navy Seal turned measly cook Casey Ryback ( remarkably stiff'n'stolid stoneface supreme Steven Seagal sans his trademark ponytail ) and several others to stop them . Director Andrew Davis , working from a gloriously preposterous script by J . F . Lawton , relates the gripping " Die Hard " on a boat story at a nonstop breakneck pace , creates a reasonable amount of tension , and stages the copious action set pieces with considerable rip-roaring aplomb . Seagal is his usual dry and cardboard self . Fortunately , the strong supporting cast compensates for his flatness . Jones in particular makes for a great hateful and ruthless heavy . However , Gary Busey almost steals the whole show with his deliciously deranged portrayal of the treacherous Commander Krill , a man so heinous that he not only tries to drown his own men , but also has the gall to spit in Ryback's bouillabaisse sauce as well ( Gary even does a hysterically funny drag scene to boot ! ) . Plus there are sound turns by Patrick O'Neal as the sage Captain Adams , Andy Romano as the ramrod Admiral Bates , Colm Meaney as the coldblooded Doumer , Nick Mancuso as shady chain-smoking jerk Tom Breaker , and Troy Evans as the gung-ho Granger . Delectable " Baywatch " blonde babe Erika Eleniak isn't given much to do in the thankless role of the token hot chick , but at least bares her beautifully bountiful breasts in one of the single most laughably gratuitous topless scenes ever committed to celluloid . The brutal hand-to-hand fisticuffs and heated firefights are every bit as taut and exciting as they ought to be . Frank Tidy's slick cinematography , Gary Chang's rousing , throbbing score and a cool trashy rock soundtrack are all likewise up to par . Sure , this movie is wildly implausible and ridiculous to the extreme , but it's this very sense of gleeful absurdity which makes it so much tremendously entertaining dumb fun .
519243	8239592	71150	8.0	The devil made her do it	A bitter and sexually frustrated crippled young woman ( superbly played with absolutely fearless abandon by Carla Gravina ) renounces her faith in God . Since said lovely young lady was in a previous life a witch who got burned at the stake as a heretic 400 years ago , this makes it doubly easy for Satan to take possession of her body . ( The scene where Gravina gives herself to Lucifer is a total doozy : a blue-painted man wearing a ram's head mask forces her to eat a severed toad's head and Gravina gleefully copulates with a goat . ) Pretty soon Gravina is making unseemly incestuous advances on her brother , cruising the streets for young men to seduce , using foul language at the diner table , frothing at the mouth , and levitating around the house . Father Mel ( " Nightmare City " ) Ferror and stepmother Alida ( " Suspiria " ) Valli are understandably perturbed . It's up to bishop Arthur ( " Let Sleeping Corpses Lie " ) Kennedy and priest George ( " Tower of Evil " ) Coulouris to save Gravina's soul before it's too late . Capably directed by Alberto De Martino ( who also co-wrote the bold script ) , with sharp photography by notorious celluloid sleazemeister Joe D'Amato , a typically fine , haunting and stirring score by Ennio Morricone and Bruno Nicolai , a creepy , uneasy atmosphere , plenty of hilariously excessive profanity ( " You stinking pots of st ! " ) , some lovably chintzy optical effects , solid acting from a uniformly excellent cast , and a rousing climactic exorcism , this enjoyably trashy Italian exploitation horror outing really delivers the satisfyingly junky demonic possession goods .
518384	8239592	90735	8.0	A fun 80's action thriller	Master thief Sam Quint ( Tommy Lee Jones in peak rough'n'tumble craggy form ) is hired by the government to steal data from a shady organization . Quint hides the data in an experimental supercar called the Black Moon . The Black Moon gets ripped off by sassy ace automobile booster Nina ( a winning performance by the insanely foxy Linda Hamilton ) , who works for a stolen car ring run by the ruthless Ed Ryland ( a nicely slimy Robert Vaughn ) . Quint has to break into Ryland's impregnable office building so he can steal back the Black Moon . Director Harvey Cokeless maintains a constant brisk pace and stages the action scenes with real rip-snorting brio . Lalo Schifrin's robust , rousing , jazzy score pumps up the tension . Misha Suslov's slick cinematography gives the film an attractive polished look . The bang-up supporting cast rates as another major plus : Richard Jaeckel as nerdy scientist Earl Windom , Bubba Smith as intimidating government agent Johnson , Lee Ving as vicious thug Marvin Ringer , Dan Shor as Windom's amiable assistant Billy Lyons , William Sanderson as sweet deaf guy Tyke Thayden , and Keenan Wynn as the ailing Iron John . Jones makes for a refreshingly human and vulnerable protagonist . The climactic break-in sequence is especially tense and gripping . Moreover , there's an amusingly sly sense of humor evident throughout . This tight , trim and witty B action thriller gets right down to brass tacks and hits the stirring spot in a satisfying straightforward and unpretentious manner .
519053	8239592	59878	8.0	A good deal of dopey fun	This completely ridiculous tongue-in-cheek adolescent sci-fi comedy romp represents 60's kitsch at its most delightfully dumb and inoffensive . The plot alone is pure silliness : A precocious little squirt scientific genius named - - what else ? - - Genius ( none other than future " Happy Days " TV show star and mainstream feature director Ron Howard ! ) creates a special formula called goo that causes both people and animals to growth substantially in size . Of course , a no-count band of rowdy rebellious teenagers led by the suave Fred ( an embarrassingly bad turn by Beau Bridges ) eat the goo and become evil tyrant towering behemoths who take over the town . It's up to nice guy Mike ( former Disney movie star Tommy Kirk ) to stop them . Boy , does this hilariously ludicrous honey deliver the campy goods with a gut-busting vengeance : we've got fumbling ( mis ) direction by the ever-inept Bert I . Gordon , uproariously poor and unconvincing ( not so ) special effects ( the huge wooden legs are especially laughable ) , extremely variable acting , a pair of giant dancing ducks , hopelessly dated " hip " slang ( favorite line : " Dig that nitty gritty " ) , a cheerfully silly tone , blithely lewd and idiotic humor ( one dude hangs off the breasts of a busty lady giant ! ) , an excellent rock soundtrack , and more insanely groovy dancing than you can shake a tail feather at ( the lengthy sequence with the over-sized teens dancing up a storm is positively sidesplitting ! ) . Better still , Jack Nizsche supplies a terrific catchy score ( the rumbling instrumental tune " The Last Race " is simply fantastic ) , both Freddy Cannon and the Beau Brummels make special guest musical appearances , and such hot babes as Joy Harmon ( the buxom blonde car wash girl in " Cool Hand Luke " ) , Tisha Sterling , and Toni Basil provide a plethora of delicious distaff eye candy . Stanley Kubrick film regular Joe Turkel plays the no-nonsense sheriff and Rance Howard even briefly pops up as a deputy . All in all , this infectiously inane stupidity sizes up as a total goofy hoot .
519254	8239592	86340	8.0	An enjoyably inane piece of early 80's sword and sorcery trash	Busty'n'lusty medieval twins Mira ( Leigh Harris ) and Mara ( Lynette Harris ) vow to seek revenge on the evil sorcerer Traigon ( a constantly snarling Roberto Ballestros ) for both murdering their mother and attempting to kill them when they were little girls . Assisting the lovely ladies are horny barbarian Erlick ( hunky Bob Nelson ) and portly warrior Baldar ( chubby wonder Bruno Key ) . Said mission is naturally easier said than done because Traigon has many tricks up his sleeve and is obsessed with sacrificing one of the beautiful'n'bountiful babes so he can become powerful enough to rule the world . Director Jack Hill , working from a blithely dopey script co-written by Jim Wynorski , loads this laughably tacky sword and sorcery fantasy romp with all the necessary ingredients to make it a so-dumb-it's-fun high camp howler : a constant fast pace , gut-bustingly bad dialogue ( favorite line : " Death is only death , swine ! " ) , hokey ( far from ) special effects , terrible acting from a lame no-name cast , an outrageously overwrought conclusion , a few nifty monsters ( I especially dug the satyr which nays like a goat and the winged lion ) , and , of course , a decent smattering of gratuitous distaff nudity courtesy of the absolutely delectable Harris sisters . As an added bonus , we even get a thrilling score from future Oscar-winning A-list composer James ( " Titanic " ) Horner and a last reel appearance by an army of zombie swordsmen . Sure , this flick is goofy junk , but it's still quite entertainingly silly schlock just the same .
519162	8239592	114568	8.0	An effectively tense and sleazy thriller	Cunning and lethal blind maniac vagrant Neil ( a wired , intense , bravura performance by the late , great Rick Dean in one of his patented insane villain parts ) terrorizes a handful of folks in a strip club at gunpoint . Neil cruelly uses everyone's individual weaknesses against them . The main target of Neil's twisted obsession is lovely stripper Christina Martin ( well played by the stunningly gorgeous Maria Ford ) . Director Dan Golden , working from a clever and compact script by Duane Whitaker , wrings plenty of gut-wrenching tension from the simple , yet gripping premise and certainly doesn't skimp on the tasty bare distaff skin . Dean and Ford both turn in stand-out work in their juicy lead roles ; they receive excellent support from Lance August as stuttering shy guy Carey , George Tovar as corrupt cop Roland , Nikki Fritz as mannish , domineering lesbian Sandra , the adorable Ann-Marie Holman as Sandra's mousy , passive lover Kitten , and R . A . Mihailoff ( Leatherface in " Leatherface : Texas Chainsaw Massacre III " ) as tough bartender Little . Both Timothy Wynn's funky score and Andrea Rosotto's slick cinematography are up to par . Popping up in nice cameos are John Lazar ( Z-Man in " Beyond the Valley of the Dolls " ) as a bar patron and Linnea Quigley as a waitress . The DVD boasts a few nifty extras : several trailers , a funny outtake reel , and a lively , informative and highly entertaining commentary by Rick Dean and Dan Golden . Good , nasty fun .
519309	8239592	91121	8.0	A surprisingly solid mid-80's made-for-TV vehicular " Death Wish " variant	When one thinks of the singularly raw , gritty and hard-hitting cinema of Abel Ferrara ( who's rough'n'tumble films include " Driller Killer , " " Ms . 45 , " and " Bad Lieutenant " ) , several scattered idiot box credits aren't the first thing to spring to mind . But back in the mid-80's the often fiercely indie and underground Ferrara briefly went mainstream and somehow wormed his way onto the boob tube , where he directed the " Crime Story " pilot , a few episodes of " Miami Vice , " and this fairly generic , yet miraculously rough-edged and compelling made-for-TV feature . Ken Wahl of " Wiseguy " TV show fame gives a somewhat stolid , but overall acceptable and engaging performance as an amiably zhlubby blue collar ordinary shmoe ace automobile mechanic whose younger brother gets killed by a drunk driver in a sinister black muscle car . Haunted by his bro's untimely death and angry as all hell , Wahl builds himself a lethal souped-up tow truck , hits the dark , hazy , perilous Los Angeles nocturnal streets looking for that spooky muscle car , and winds up becoming a self-appointed vigilante who takes out all those leering , unruly , bellicose , recklessly inebriated killers on wheels who pose a general threat to decent , law-abiding folks on the road with them . Naturally the cops want to nail Wahl real quick and the media turns him into a folk hero . Okay , so the plot is little more than a vehicular " Death Wish " variant crossed with " Duel " and the picture does suffer somewhat from unavoidable mild'n'middlebrow TV movie sanitizing ( the sporadic sappy pop-slop tunes mewling away on the soundtrack are especially irritating ) , but Ferrara's strong , sturdy and stylish direction certainly compensates for these minor flaws . As usual with Ferrara , he takes a provocative questioning stance with the obsessive , tormented protagonist , vigilantism is properly addressed as the knotty , nothing remotely simple or easy about it issue that it really is , James Lemmo's slick , polished , glittering neon-hued cinematography vividly depicts a luridly gleaming nighttime atmosphere , and the palpable evocation of the scary , forbidding and dangerous urban hellhole jungle setting positively seethes with a frightfully omnipresent menace . Moreover , there are fine supporting turns by Nancy Allen as a sweet radio talk show host , the always reliable Robert Culp as a hard-nosed detective , and Stan Shaw as Wahl's nice dude best buddy , David Frank supplies an effectively spare , shivery , jazz-flavored score , and the final showdown between Wahl and the muscle car delivers the pulse-pounding , heart-stopping , metal-mangling auto-to-auto stand-off goods . Sure , it's not exactly one of Ferrara's best-ever offerings , but this generally solid and satisfying item sure ain't no lemon , either .
519012	8239592	200753	8.0	A rather clunky , but overall sincere and touching social drama	Mischievous Johnny Banes ( scrappy Dion Gossett ) has an unfortunate knack for getting into all kinds of trouble : he smokes , lies , steals , rudely disrupts class , doesn't do his schoolwork , and even mugs an old guy for his money ! Worse yet , Johnny's vain struggling actress mother Denise ( nicely played by Sandy Reed ) and hard-working insurance salesman stepfather Phil ( a strong and likable performance by Renny Roker ) spend more time squabbling with each other than they do with Johnny . Writer / director Horace Jackson concocts a somewhat clumsy , but well-meaning and insightful social drama that pertinently addresses how severe parental neglect contributes substantially to juvenile delinquency . Moreover , Jackson tosses in occasional " what the hell ? " unexpected oddball moments : Denise gives Johnny a rubdown in a scene that's simmering with incestuous undertones and in one especially startling sequence a creepy pedophile assaults a little girl in a bathroom . The jolting downbeat ending packs a pretty potent punch , too . The kid actors are all appealingly natural ( Gossett in particular impresses as the moody and unhappy Johnny ) . Rich Holmes is memorably hateful as stern history teacher Mr . Bishop . Dennis Coffey's funky , syncopated score and Mark Rasmussen's plain , no-frills cinematography further enhance the gritty realism of this moving and effective picture .
519357	8239592	114608	8.0	A real wild and gory blast of a horror flick	Mysterious drifter Brayker ( superbly played by William Sadler ) possesses the last of seven ancient keys that the demonic , yet charismatic Collector ( deliciously essayed with lip-smacking sardonic panache by Billy Zane ) needs to acquire in order to destroy humanity . Brayker seeks refuge in a rundown motel . The Collector and his army of lethal , grotesquely ugly ghouls lay siege to the joint . Ably directed with considerable rip-snorting flair by Ernest Dickerson , with slick cinematography by Rick Bota , a handy helping of graphic gore ( gruesome highlights include a fist punched through a head and an arm being ripped off ) , unusually well-drawn and engaging characters , a rousing score by Ed Shearmur , an admirably straight tone , and inspired touches of pitch-black gallows humor , this movie delivers a fast-paced package of fun and frights . Sadler and Zane are terrific in the leads ; they receive excellent support from Jada Pinkett-Smith as spunky ex-con Jerryline , CCH Pounder as tough , cynical motel proprietor Irene , Brenda Bakke as forlorn prostitute Cordelia , Thomas Haden Church as sleazy abject coward Roach , Dick Miller as lovable old drunk Uncle Willie , John Schuck as ramrod Sheriff Tupper , Charles Fleischer as the meek Wally , and Gary Farmer as bumbling Deputy Bob Martel . A very solid and satisfying horror picture .
518000	8239592	760186	8.0	A really fun horror / action hybrid romp	An elite commando squad led by the rugged Hawk ( an engaging performance by Casper Van Dien ) and his equally tough longtime buddy Grieves ( the hulking , deep-voiced Kevin Grevioux , who's excellent ) run afoul of lethal and powerful vampires in a South American rain forest . Grieves gets turned into a vampire and becomes the leader of a savage roving herd . Moreover , Hawk has to rescue his spunky scientist ex-wife Dr . Laurie Williams ( winningly played by luscious blonde looker Jennifer O'Dell ) from the bloodsuckers ' evil clutches . Writer / director Kevin VanHook concocts a fresh , lively and inspired horror / action genre hybrid that delivers likable characters , a handy helping of graphic gore , a constant snappy pace , and plentiful rousing and well-staged action scenes . In addition , VanHook puts a novel spin on standard vampire lore : these vampires are extremely smart , hunt in packs , and can walk around in broad daylight . Van Dien and Grevioux are fine in the leads ; they receive able support from Tony Plana as amiable local innkeeper Javier , Ray Park as a pair of vicious martial arts acrobatic twins , Joyce Giraud as fierce , yet sexy vampire vixen Estrella , Lynda Carter as the hard-nosed Colonel Jessica Weaver , and Danny Trejo as jolly , wily fisherman Montegna . Matt Steinauer's slick cinematography and Ludek Drizhal's stirring score are both up to speed . Spirited and exciting , this nifty little feature makes for hugely enjoyable viewing .
518960	8239592	94886	8.0	Victor Salva's supremely creepy and effective debut horror feature	A trio of dangerous psychopaths escape from a nearby asylum and murder three circus clowns . The deranged fruitcakes dress up in the clowns ' garish costumes and make-up . They proceed to besiege a large mansion where three brothers - - jittery Casey ( the solid Nathan Forrest Winters ) , friendly Geoffrey ( winningly played by Brian McHugh ) and mean overbearing bully Randy ( a marvelously hateful turn by a then unknown Sam Rockwell ) - - live . Tautly directed by Victor Salva ( who later gave us the excellent road thriller pip " The Nature of the Beast " and the deliciously perverse " Jeepers Creepers " pictures ) , with surprisingly strong performances by the three capable youthful leads , plenty of creepy atmosphere , a pleasingly concise 81 minute running time , and a respectable corpse count of eight , " Clownhouse " makes the grade as a gripping and well-made edge-of-your-seat nail-biter . The clever subversion of the naturally unsettling aura about clowns ( what's actually behind the cheery smiling facade ? ) is an especially smart and inspired touch . Moreover , Salva wisely downplays graphic gore and excessive violence in favor of deftly creating and sustaining a supremely eerie and unnerving tone . It's the film's potently spooky and nightmarish mood which really clinches its sterling status as an extremely scary and harrowing horror sleeper .
519436	8239592	1414345	8.0	An amusing horror comedy short	A miserable henpecked sci-fi movie fan ( a solid performance by writer / director Jason Knuth ) wishes that his shrewish and nagging wife ( a perfectly bitchy Beth Knuth ) was dead . The wife gets killed in an automobile accident , but comes back to life as a pesky rot-faced zombie . This short'n'sweet little horror comedy romp maintains a nicely deadpan tone throughout , pokes affectionate fun at both cheesy fright fare and hardcore film nerds , and culminates in a nifty , if rather predictable conclusion . Moreover , the zombie make-up is really gnarly , the cinematography is likewise pretty crisp , the generic shivery synthesizer score does the trick , and the soundtrack boasts a few lively rock songs . Plus the outtakes are absolutely sidesplitting . A real hoot .
518091	8239592	50610	8.0	A cool 50's sci-fi alien invasion flick	A horde of evil invading aliens unleash a giant robot named Kronos on our planet . Kronos goes on a rampage . It's up to stalwart scientist Dr . Leslie Gaskell ( well played by Jeff Morrow ) to figure out a way to stop Kronos before it's too late . Director Kurt Neuman , working from a clever script by Louis Goldman , relates the story at a steady pace and maintains a serious tone throughout . The picture begins a little slow , but kicks into gear and starts cooking once Kronos arrives and runs amok ( the sequences with Kronos causing all kinds of mass destruction are both exciting and impressive ) . This film further benefits from the commendably sincere acting by a solid cast , with especially praiseworthy work by Morrow , Barbara Lawrence as fetching , spunky lab assistant Vera Hunter , John Emery as the detached , possessed Dr . Hubbell Eliot , George O'Hanlon ( the voice of George Jetson on " The Jetsons " ) as the affable Dr . Arnold Culver , and the ever-reliable Morris Ankrum as the concerned Dr . Albert Stern . Karl Struss's crisp widescreen black and white cinematography , the nifty special effects ( Kronos looks pretty gnarly ) , and the spirited shuddery score by Paul Sawtell and Bert Shefter are all on the money as well . A fun film .
518204	8239592	154013	8.0	A hilariously horrendous tongue-in-cheek porno comedy hoot	Picture an episode of " Happy Days " gone incredibly seedy , with lots of foxy naked women and scuzzy hardcore sex scenes , with the added attraction of a fantastic rockabilly score and plenty of amusingly leering humor , and you'll have a good idea of what this enjoyably mindless 50's nostalgia-tinged mess is like . Writer / director / producer / star Johnny Legend , a show biz jack of all trades whose many job titles include wrestling manager , filmmaker , rockabilly singer / songwriter ( Legend's potent double whammy of the truly cool " Are You Hep to It ? " and the especially smokin ' " Hot Rocks " are featured on the movie's stand-out soundtrack , which boasts such appropriately salacious tunes as the deliriously bawdy " Slip , Slip , Slippin ' In " by Mac Curtis , Ray Campi's feverishly cooking " Eager Boy , " and Alvis Wayne's tart'n'tasty " I Wanna Eat Your Puddin ' " ) , cameo actor , and general all-around self-stylized California eccentric , juggles several balls here with largely disastrous results , creating a delightfully obnoxious tongue-in-cheek fiasco with an endearingly rank and witless sense of breezy'n'cheesy high school locker room humor . Legend even acts in this gloriously ghastly and off-the-wall period oddity ; he hammily portrays manic , fast-talking , foul-mouthed second-rate Wolfman Jack wannabe disc jockey Mambo Remus . The plot is messy , sprawling , and virtually nonexistent , the editing , sound quality , and cinematography are all strictly home movie level amateurish , the characters by and large extremely unappealing numbskulls ( Tony Conn in particular is seriously creepy and unlikable as lonely , tormented , pathetic middle-aged voyeur loser Willy ) , and the dialogue is pretty terrible , but that really doesn't matter much . This film is still awful funny in a so-crass-it's-killer sort of way . The loosely knit , often crudely humorous and usually quite sexually graphic vignettes rigidly adhere to an " American Graffiti " - like multi-storied format ; my favorite subplot focuses on the randy escapades of a sex-crazed madwoman called Babs the nuthouse nympho . Better still , the hardcore sex scenes are every bit as rough and raunchy as they ought to be ( among the highlights are the gorgeous Serena masturbating with an automobile cigarette lighter and legendary Me Decade porn stud John Holmes doing just what you think with two lovely ladies both inside and beside a pool ) . Plus there's lots of uproariously tasteless bad jokes about such trashy topics as smoking weed , cunnilingus , fellatio , rape , and even bestiality . A real sleazy hoot .
518690	8239592	54744	8.0	A fun & enjoyable low-budget early 60's JD hoot	Five delinquent adolescents known collectively as " the Choppers " terrorize the countryside by stripping cars left by the side of the road with ruthless efficiency . The laughably clueless local yokel cops bumble , fumble and stumble around in fruitless circles until the discovery of a lone chicken feather at a crime site ( ! ) steers them in the right direction . Tautly directed by Leigh Jason , crisply shot in gorgeous black and white , further graced by hip slangy lingo ( " square johns " for decent law-abiding citizens , " bandits " for the fuzz ) , groovy music ( highly unlikely and sublimely geeky flash-in-the-pan wannabe teen scream idol Arch Hall , Jr . belts out a couple of endearingly goofy songs ) , solid acting , continuity errors aplenty , and snappy pacing , this funky little item sizes up as a good deal of trim , no-frills , mean'n'lean early 60's JD crime movie fun . Yummy blonde " Playboy " Playmate Marianne Gaba ( Miss September ' 59 ) looks quite delectable in her tight sweater and form-fitting skirt . Rotund veteran sleaze film character actor Bruno Ve Sota has one of his best-ever roles as Moose , a greedy , grubby , no-count , cigar-chewing junkyard owner who fences stolen automobile parts on the side . Scrawny chopper Rex Holman also portrayed a member of the lethal highway gang in " Panic in Year Zero . " Arch Hall , Sr . , who both wrote and produced this picture , pops up in a sizable supporting part as a smooth-voiced radio reporter and does marvelously mellifluous vocal work on the film's nifty trailer . Moreover , this flick scores bonus points for depicting the choppers as toxic products of messed-up families : Musclehead Torch has a pathetic drunk for a dad , Holman was raised by an aunt and uncle after his original parents dumped him when he was just a baby , and cocky ringleader Hall , Jr . is a spoiled rotten rich brat who's hungry for kicks . Those fine folks at Something Weird Video offer this baby on a terrific DVD double bill with the equally excellent and entertaining Arch Hall , Jr . rock'n'roll star vehicle " Wild Guitar . " Can you dig it , daddy-o ? I sure can - - and certainly did .
518566	8239592	68599	8.0	A super serving of 70's drive-in schlock	A trio of sexy young stewardesses have all sorts of misadventures as they travel all over the world : klutzy eager beaver rookie Toby ( an endearingly daffy performance by busty blonde babe Pat Anderson ) romances handsome doctor David ( likable Richard Young ) while being forced to contend with her meddlesome overbearing shrew of a mother ( a hilariously histrionic Naomi Stevens ) , perky expert martial artist Andrea ( the lovely Lenore Kasdorf ) searches for her missing boyfriend , and poor Sherry ( the cute Lyllah Torena ) gets abducted by a nasty narcotics and prostitution ring run by the nefarious Donald ( a perfectly slimy Ken Metcalfe ) . Prolific Filipino exploitation feature director Cirio Santiago , working from a blithely trashy script by Miller Drake , crams the wildly colorful and eventful 71 minute running time with abundant delicious female nudity ( the first topless scenes occurs barely a minute into the movie ! ) , seedy subplots , a funky-groovin ' prog-rock score , amusingly dumb lowbrow humor , several uproariously inept chopsocky fight scenes ( the blind assassin with the cane that fires deadly poison darts is a total riot ! ) , and a rousing all-out action-loaded conclusion . Moreover , Santiago maintains a nonstop zippy pace and a light , bouncy tone from start to finish . The three female leads are all quite attractive and appealing , with Anderson the stand-out of the bunch . Popping up in nifty minor roles are Vic Diaz as crooked cop Enriquez and Dick Miller as a friendly cab driver . Of course , this flick is completely silly and ridiculous , but that's exactly why it ultimately sizes up as an absolute sleazy hoot .
518592	8239592	116393	8.0	An excellent and underrated crime thriller	Honest black cop Michael Rhoades ( a fine performance by Mario Van Peebles ) takes a stand against a racist group of white vigilante police officers called the Phantoms and does his best to acquire the necessary evidence to bust these guys . Of course , Rhoades immediately finds himself in considerable jeopardy . Directed with real style and assurance by Mario and Melvin Van Peebles , with a strong script by Rick Natkin and David Fuller , a credible sense of pervasive moral baseness and corruption , a tough , gritty tone , slick cinematography by Rhett Morita , an engrossing plot , a moody score by Larry Brown , a provocative subtext about the abuse of power , a snappy pace , and several exciting action scenes , this movie makes the grade as a tense and compelling cop flick . The picture further benefits from sound acting from a top-rate cast : Josh Brolin as sadistic former marine Keith DeBruler , Cynda Williams as helpful FBI agent Anita Boyard , the always great J . T . Walsh as smarmy Lieutenant William Eyler , Stephen Lang as the slimy , venomous Moose Tavola , Sean McCann as venerable old-timer Clute Mirkovich , Melvin Van Peebles as wise , amiable veteran Andre Speier , and Bruce Smolanoff as hateful jerk Theo Jensen . A solid and satisfying film .
519080	8239592	200515	8.0	An enjoyably cruddy piece of slasher schlock	This deliciously cheesy howler gets off to a rip-roaring start with busty blonde babe Sally ( luscious Meredith O'Brien ) doing just what you think with her nerdy boyfriend Vic ( the extremely dorky Vinnie Bilancio ) . Of course , right after they're finished both of them are brutally butchered by maniacal machete-brandishing psycho the Clown ( the pitifully unscary Shemp Moseley ) . Sensitive Tricia ( Jennifer Ritchkoff ) , nice , considerate Steve ( Michael Taylor ) , jerky , irritable , foul-mouthed Jay ( the supremely annoying Tim Young ) , and stuck-up Nicole ( foxy blonde Betheny Zolt ) all go camping in the same sylvan area where a rash of gruesome murders have occurred throughout the years . They find themselves stranded and on their own in the woods after their tough tomboy guide Harris ( Courtney Taylor ) gets offed . Writer / director Brad Sykes shamelessly trots out all the tried'n'true slice'n'dice clichés ala " Friday the 13th " : we've got the nutty old guy ( wildly overplayed by Joseph Haggerty ) warning the young adults to stay away from Camp Blood ( naturally said warning is ignored or else there wouldn't be a movie ) , shaky hand-held camera-work for the killer's point of view stalking shots , the scary urban legend-type story told around a campfire , and even the ever-popular " have sex and die " routine . The tacky , unconvincing gore , Jeff Leroy's crude , fuzzy , static , washed-out cinematography ( the ugly color in this picture looks dingy and dismal throughout ) , the laughably amateurish acting from the lame no-name cast , a generic ooga-booga spooky'n'shivery synthesizer score by Ghost , the dreadful excessively profane dialogue , the draggy pace , a talky script , the nonexistent tension , and the incredibly obnoxious characters all further enhance the lovably lousy charm of this endearingly crummy hoot .
518332	8239592	173807	8.0	A hilariously horrendous hoot	Obviously made to cash-on on the popularity of such vigilante action pictures as " Death Wish " and " The Exterminator , " this uproariously awful crud looks like it was shot on a paltry budget of roughly fifty bucks . After beginning with some badly staged Vietnam war combat footage , the story proper kicks in : Crazed traumatized ' Nam vet automobile mechanic Mike ( a simply terrible performance by Antoine John Mottet ) can't stand all the rampant crime in his strife-ridden urban neighborhood , so he starts violently rubbing out assorted low-life scum like rapists , drug pushers , pimps , street gang members , and mobsters . Mike's fellow ' Nam vet best buddy Lt . Roger O'Malley ( a sleepwalking Christopher Mitchum , who sports a bushy mustache ) naturally turns out to be the cop determined to nab Mike . Boy , does this gloriously ghastly garbage possess all the right wrong stuff to qualify as a real four-star stinkeroonie ; we've got slapdash ( mis ) direction by James Bryan ( who also blessed us with the similarly shabby splatter slasher schlockfest " Don't Go in the Woods " ) , uneven stop'n'go pacing , ragged editing , laughable tin-eared dialogue ( " I'm the king , " a nasty would-be rapist sneers to a whimpering female victim ) , ratty cinematography , lots of clunky Vietnam flashbacks , pathetic acting ( Aldo Ray hams it up to a dreadful extreme as a corrupt police commissioner while Renee Harmon as a pesky journalist renders all her dialogue borderline incomprehensible with her heavy foreign accent ) , a cheesy generic synthesizer score , ineptly handled action scenes , and an annoyingly abrupt ending . Moreover , this marvelously maladroit mess offers several sidesplitting moments of inspired camp : Mike likes to stuff live grenades down people's pants and two teenage junkie babes get a serious case of the pot giggles while smoking grass together . A total gut-busting riot .
519381	8239592	279919	8.0	A very enjoyable Bigfoot documentary	The meteoric success of " The Legend of Boggy Creek " not only led to two sequels , but also beget a flood of like-minded documentaries all striving to both provide photographic evidence of the ever-evasive creature's existence and bilk bucks from the wallets of innumerable drive-in theater patrons . " The Legend of Bigfoot " is such a cash-in , right down to its title which suspiciously echoes " Boggy Creek " ' s moniker . Actually , this appealingly earnest and engrossing effort manages to be highly enjoyable thanks mostly to the delightfully rough , tough and oh-so-gruff rugged outdoorsman presence of Ivan Marx . Marx , a hunter , trapper , tracker and all-around man's man in excelsis , embarks on a vigorous , determined , unflagging cross country pilgrimage to track down and confirm the veracity of that much beloved sylvan beastman of longstanding myth . Marx travels all over America from the Oregon coast to the Colorado Rocky Mountains to Sasquatch's mating grounds in the Artic Circle . It's Marx's clearly honest and unfeigned commitment to finding Bigfoot which gives this feature a significant lift out of the rut . It's especially a pleasure to hear Marx's crusty say-it-like-you-see it musings on mankind's intrusion on nature , his disdain towards shyster businessmen's crass commercial exploiting of Bigfoot , occasional self-deprecating remarks ( " Here I am a grown man runnin ' around the woods chasin ' after some fairytale " ) , cynicism concerning the so-called experts ' offensive arrogance , and brilliant deductive observations about Bigfoot's migratory nature based on the behavior of other animals . Moreover , Marx's delving into Native American folklore concerning Mr . Over-sized Pawprints is interesting and informative ( other Indian names for ol ' big'n'hairy include the Oh-Man , Bushman and Stickman ) . The excellent cinematography captures the breathtaking beauty of the North American wilderness with stunning clarity and precision . Harry Stuart Winer's brisk direction , a script which supplies a winningly sincere blend of skepticism and speculation , and Don Peake's liltingly melodic country score round off the goodies to be relished in this infectiously full-blooded cinematic ode to a faded , rapidly disappearing , adventurous all-American frontier spirit .
519131	8239592	228196	8.0	A very neat and enjoyable sci-fi / action / Western hybrid winner	The time : The bleak near future . The place : The desolate town of Hartford City . Noble lawman Jack Holt ( the solid Frank Stewart ) gets killed by several goons who work for Hawk ( a perfectly sinister Loren Blackwell ) , an evil insurance company mogul who governs over the burg with an iron fist . Jack's easygoing musician brother Wade ( excellently played by the amiable Daniel Chapman ) tries to avenge his death , but gets arrested and spends five years in jail . After he gets sprung from prison , Wade returns to Hardford City to settle the score with Hawk . He's assisted by gutsy gal pal Annie Northbride ( a nice'n'sexy turn by fetching blonde looker Ruth Collins ) and loyal former cellmate Bunky ( a wonderfully engaging portrayal by John Scott ) . Director Tom Garrett , working from a clever and inspired script by John McLaughlin ( said script mixes elements from the action , Western , and science fiction genres into a pretty tasty and imaginative synthesis ) , makes the most out of a limited budget : he stages the thrilling action set pieces with considerable flair , maintains a steady pace throughout , and , most of all , does an expert job of crafting a funky , hazy , impressively hip style which oozes 50's type rockabilly cool from every snazzy frame . This film further benefits from fine acting by an appealing cast : Chapman does well as the supremely likable reluctant hero , British novelist and former " Fangoria " magazine film journalist Philip Nutman almost steals the whole show with his spot-on performance as Hawk's mean , gum-chewing right-hand man Tough , and Karen Rizzo makes a favorable impression as friendly bar owner Star . Adam Goldfine's crisp cinematography gives the picture an attractively polished look . Chapman's twangy , harmonic countryish score also hits the tuneful spot ( Chapman even wrote and sings a few tuneful songs that are featured on the soundtrack ) . 80's splatterpunk horror writers John Skipp and Craig Spector briefly pop up as a couple of - - what else ? - - splatterpunks . Offbeat and original , this quirky little number sizes up as a highly worthwhile and unjustly neglected sleeper .
518383	8239592	58753	8.0	A nifty 60's witchcraft horror feature	Vengeful witch Vanessa Whitlock ( strikingly played by the slim , sharp-featured Yvette Rees , who looks like Barbara Steele ) gets resurrected in the present day after her grave is desecrated by land developers . Vanessa , assisted by angry warlock Morgan Whitlock ( a fine , forceful performance by Lon Chaney , Jr . ) , exacts a harsh revenge on the Lanier family , whose ancestors buried her alive 300 years ago . Director Don Sharp , working from a compact script by Harry Spalding , relates the absorbing story at a steady pace . Moreover , Sharp does an expert job of creating an eerie , misty , midnight-in-the-cemetery gloom-doom atmosphere , stages the shock scenes with commendable gusto , and delivers a few nice murder set pieces . The sturdy acting from a solid cast qualifies as another significant asset : Jack Hadley as the smart , rationale Bill Lanier , Jill Dixon as Bill's charming wife Tracy , David Weston as Bill's likable son Todd , Diane Clare as the fetching Amy Whitlock , Marie Ney as the fragile , elderly Malvina Lanier , Viola Keats as the scared , superstitious Helen Lanier , and Victor Brooks as the puzzled Inspector Baldwin . Arthur Lewis ' crisp , agile black and white cinematography , the grimly serious tone , Carlo Martelli's spooky'n'shuddery score and the thrilling fiery conclusion are all likewise up to speed . A worthy and rewarding fright flick .
518658	8239592	78240	9.0	The greatest horror-Western ever made	Arkansas , circa 1865 : After losing the final battle of the Civil War , sexist , sadistic Conferate commander Wishbone Cutter ( a gruff , intimidating , but fairly restrained turn by the often overly hammy Joe Don Baker , here giving one of his better , less blustery and bombastic performances ) , faithful half-Irish , half-Native American companion Moon ( beautifully essayed by Joy Houck , Jr . , a good , engaging actor who usually toiled away in forgettable junk unworthy of his talent ) , and laid-back geologist Amos " Teach " Raymond ( affable Ted Neeley , who played God's only son in " Jesus Christ , Superstar " ) venture into the dense , remote , uninviting Arkansas wilderness to unearth a diamond stash located on a sacred Indian mountain that's rumored to be guarded by territorial demons . Along the way the motley threesome pick up the comely , beguiling Drucilla Wilcox ( the mesmerizingly winsome'n'willowy Sondra Locke , whose pale , haunted , crystal-clear blue eyes are vaguely redolent of Meg Foster's otherworldly orbs ) , the lone shell-shocked survivor of a brutal Indian attack . Pretty soon the quartet is being terrorized by some mysterious assailant ( s ) . Could they be a strange tribe of inhospitable Apaches ? Or is it the lethal woodland spirit Chikara , who rules over hawks and doesn't take kindly to interlopers trespassing on its terrain ? Writer / director Earl E . Smith , who wrote both " The Legend of Boggy Creek " and " The Town That Dreaded Sundown " for Charles B . Pierce , does a superlative job of keeping the viewer on edge , adeptly creating a spooky , yet somehow oddly plausible and flavorful period tone which slowly , but surely grows on the viewer as the film gradually , carefully , and skillfully reaches its genuinely chilling and startling conclusion . The top-notch acting greatly contributes to the film's overall gritty credibility , with particularly nifty bits by the ever-scummy and unnerving unsung Western supporting villain John Davis Chandler as a repulsive backwoods psycho , Dennis Fimple as a grizzled , cloddish fur trapper who refers to the forest spirits as " haints , " and the magnificent Slim Pickens in a lovely , touching cameo as Virgil Cane , a sweet old-timer who's fatally wounded early in the picture and tells Cutter about the cache of diamonds right before he dies . The rousing , ferociously rough and pulverizing opening battle sequence starts the film on a stirring and striking note , with excellent , poignant use being made of the Band's terrific , tearful ballad " The Night They Drove Ol ' Dixie Down . " There's also some surprisingly vicious violence that one doesn't always see in a PG rated flick ( e . g . , the scene where Cutter removes an arrow from Raymond's arm is especially painful ) and plenty of supremely creepy skin-crawling enigmatic " what's really going on here ? " atmosphere . Quirky , low-key , and above all refreshingly different and original , " The Shadow of Chikara " is undoubtedly the finest , scariest and most exceptionally well-crafted horror-Western to ever grace celluloid . It's an unjustly forgotten little jewel of a sleeper that's well worth the extra effort to dig up and check out .
519359	8239592	91209	9.0	An edgy and intense 80's " danger on the road " nail-biter	Sweet , naive , wet behind the ears young guy Jim Halsey ( an unexpectedly strong C . Thomas Howell , whose callow boyishness and soft passivity for once work in his favor ) is driving a friend's car from Chicago , Illinois to San Diego , California through a lonely stretch of dusty and desolate Texas backroads . Jim makes the grave mistake of giving a ride to mysterious psychotic hitchhiker John Ryder ( an impeccably icy performance by a frightfully remote and intense Rutger Hauer , who's never been more serenely chilling than he is here ) , a calmly malevolent itinerant serial killer whose attempt at adding Halsey to his ever-growing number of victims gets foiled when Halsey forcefully ejects him from his speeding car . But Ryder hasn't finished with the hapless , cowering lad . Pretty soon poor Jim has been incriminated in a series of gruesome murders that were committed by Ryder , who obviously wants the boy to overcome his wimpiness and work up the necessary guts to take him out for reasons which are hinted at , but never completely explained ( subconcious guilt ? seething repressed homosexual lust ? a desire to call it quits and have someone else assume the role you played in life ? The possibilities are endless ) . Naturally , the cops are useless and only token nice gal waitress Jennifer Jason Leigh tries to help out , but winds up meeting an especially nasty end . Director Robert Harmon milks the harsh , upsetting and nihilistic implications of Eric Red's slyly open-ended and allegorical script for all they're worth , creating a potently tense , brooding , oddly surreal nightmarish atmosphere that's both engrossingly twisted and deliciously oblique , staging several breathtaking car chases with consummate skill ( extra props are in order here for John Seale's stunning cinematography and Mark Isham's moody , low-key score ) , never holding back on the unsparingly gruesome violence ( watch out for the infamous severed-fingers-in - - the-French-fries scene ! ) , and slowly , but surely erasing the fine line between good and evil , right and wrong , decency and indecency , even purity and wickedness as the film races towards its shatteringly vague conclusion which refuses to firmly state whether Halsey has either been irredeemably corrupted or considerably strengthened by his hair-raising , soul-crushing , will-testing brush with death . An absolute powerhouse .
518351	8239592	95583	9.0	You have the right to enjoy this excellent and hugely entertaining 80's B-horror gem	Bitter , hulking , vengeful cop Matt Cordell ( the enormous Robert Z'Dar in his best-ever role ) embarks on a brutal and frightening killing spree in New York City , viciously slaughtering folks left and right . Rugged detective Lieutenant McCrae ( the always fine and personable Tom Atkins ) , honest framed patrolman Jack Forrest ( a marvelously engaging Bruce Campbell ) , and his feisty fellow flatfoot Theresa Malloy ( a delightfully spunky and sassy Laurene Landon ) investigate the case and discover a major league conspiracy pertaining to Cordell that goes straight to the top of city hall government . Ably directed with tremendous rip-snorting style and gusto by William Lustig , with a very clever and witty script by the great Larry Cohen , slick cinematography by Vincent J . Rabe , several nifty murder set pieces , a nicely gritty and seedy Big Apple atmosphere , amusingly macabre dollops of pitch-black humor , a spooky , stirring score by Jay Chattaway ( the eerie main whistled theme is especially haunting and effective ) , a constant snappy pace , and a rousing last reel car chase , " Maniac Cop " delivers a great deal of lively , exciting and straightforward rough'n'ready low-budget horror / action thriller exploitation fun . The stand-out supporting cast of wonderfully familiar and dependable B-flick faces in particular is a substantial asset : Richard Roundtree as a corrupt commissioner , William Smith as an equally crooked police chief , Sheree North as Cordell's weary , crippled , protective police lady girlfriend , boxer Jake " Raging Bull " LeMotta as a detective , John Goff as a sleazy lawyer , " Evil Dead " director Sam Raimi as a TV reporter , George " Buck " Flower as a guy on television talking about how nowadays cops have to kill people in order to get respect , and Patrick Wright as a prison guard . Better still , the characters are exceptionally well-drawn with surprising depth and substance . For example , Cordell was originally a good , but overzealous police officer who got betrayed by the very system he believed in and has thus become a lethal ball of homicidal rage who will kill anyone luckless enough to cross his deadly path . Moreover , Forrest isn't your standard true blue pure streak of white heroic protagonist as well ; he's a decent , but flawed guy who's unfaithful to his wife and is forced to go into action to clear his unfairly besmirched name . It's this welcome and commendable element of refreshing complexity which in turn makes " Maniac Cop " a superior fright feature that's wholly worthy of its cult status .
519040	8239592	175536	9.0	An absolutely astonishing piece of gleefully demented & degenerate filth	Any film which toplines a teenage bulimic drug addict prostitute criminal sociopath who when she isn't indulging in scarf'n'barf eating binges habitually robs her johns so she can eke out a sordidly meager existence as its anti-heroine is unarguably pushing the limits of good taste and restraint to the breaking point . Well , this shockingly base and savage exploitation stunner not only graphically depicts various acts of all-out depravity in unsparingly explicit detail , but also wallows in a festering sinkhole of unremittingly foul no-holds-barred cinematic scuzziness with a certain lip-smacking fiendish glee . When underage hooker White Girl ( the luscious Natasha Lyonne ) meets deranged lesbian sexual psychopath serial killer Cyclona ( galvanizing spitfire Maria Celedonio ) in a brutal juvenile detention center , it's clear right from the start that they are a match made in bad girl hell . Pretty soon the dangerously nutso twosome escape and go on the lam , embarking on a mondo berserko crime spree as they travel cross country to Tijuana , Mexico , where they believe both sanctuary and possible redemption awaits them in the form of demented pedophile cannibal transvestite kiddie-porn making nun ( ! ) Sister Gomez ( an amazingly wacked portrayal by " Buffalo ' 66 " auteur Vincent Gallo ) . Powered along by a pair of laudably fearless , anything-goes , let-it-all-hang-out dynamic and uninhibited performances by Lyonne and Celedonio , loaded to the grimy gills with nonstop seedy thrills , strikingly ferocious violence , and carnal perversions of every conceivable stripe , and rounding things off with a gruesomely over-the-top nasty conclusion that's sure to knock the air out of your lungs , this thoroughly warped and electrifying crime / chase / chicks-in-chains sleaze film take on the classic Grimm Brothers fairytale " Hansel and Gretel " will either delight you with its impressively shameless and aggressive assault-on-your-senses agenda or offend you to the ninth degree for the very same reason . Before you ask precisely which side of the fence I'm on with this particular flick , let me state for the record that any picture which features nifty cameos by John Landis as a hard-nosed judge , David Alan Grier as a scummy sex-crazed shyster lawyer , and " Drugstore Cowboy " ' s Max Perlich as a slacker drunk , numerous acts of vicious murder , masturbation , full-frontal shower room nudity , projectile puking by the literal gallon , necrophilia , spray paint-huffing , and a funky , rollicking trashy score that's in equal parts digging rap and ripping surf-rock will always get my vote .
518097	8239592	74739	9.0	A sweet little seriocomic indie sleeper	12-year-old Kenny ( an engaging portrayal by Dan McCann ) hangs out with mischievous best buddy Doug ( the very likable Michael Baldwin ) , tries to figure out girls , musters up the courage to face mean , fearsome bully Johnny Hoffman ( an effectively hateful Willy Masterson ) , learns about death and mortality ( Doug's sickly dog has to be put to sleep ) , and prepares for Halloween night . Writer / director Don Coscarelli delivers a charming and warm-hearted little gem about 70's suburbanite adolescence that's remarkably bereft of both sour cynicism and cloying sentimentality ; instead the rambling episodic narrative ambles along in a most delightfully breezy'n'easy manner and offers plenty of spot-on moving and / or amusing moments . Better still , the cute cast of personable kid thespians all come through with appealingly naturalistic performances : McCann and Baldwin positively shine in the leads , receiving fine support from Jeff Roth as pesky , yet lovable little squirt Sherman , Terrie Kalbus as fetching blonde babe Marcy , and Eswin Cajas as foreign exchange student Paco . Plus there are nice turns by Reggie Bannister as friendly , understanding teacher Mr . Donovan , Ralph Richmond as Doug's jolly government agent father Big Doug , Kenneth J . Jones as hot-tempered football coach Mr . Soupy , and Clay Foster as amiable old timer Mr . Brink . Fred Myrow's mellow and melodic score totally hits the groovy spot . Coscarelli's sunny cinematography gives the picture an attractive bright look . A lovely and poignant treat .
518930	8239592	734739	9.0	Tim Thomerson is outstanding as a shameless hack stand-up comedian	I've been a huge fan of Tim Thomerson every since he portrayed tough-as-nails detective Jack Deth in " Trancers . " He's one of my all-time favorite character actors who's appeared in such excellent movies as " Uncommon Valor , " " Near Dark , " " Nemesis , " and " Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas . " He usually plays laconic rough'n'tumble macho guys or goofy tongue-in-cheek parts , but Tim really shows his substantial dramatic range here as shameless hack stand-up comedian Billy Diamond , who steals whole bits and pieces of his act from other comics ' routines . One fateful day Diamond gets fatally shot by a struggling comic he stole a gag from . He winds up in a particularly ironic kind of hell in which he's forced to talk about the worst things that happened in his life while an audience laughs uproariously at his abject pain and misery . Thomerson was a stand-up comedian prior to embarking on his acting career . He brings a real pathos and conviction to the role of the smarmy Diamond that's both surprising and impressive . His acting in this terrific episode rates highly as some of the best he's ever done and offers proof positive that Tim Thomerson is one tremendously talented and versatile actor who doesn't get the attention and accolades he deserves as often as he should .
518239	8239592	78492	9.0	An excellent and exciting action adventure treat	Hard-nosed mercenary Colonel Allen Faulker ( a superbly steely Richard Burton ) gets an assignment to rescue African president Julius Limbani ( well played Winston Ntshona ) from a prison camp . Faulker rounds up his best men for the tough and demanding job : flippant dandy Lieutenant Shawn Flynn ( the ever-suave Roger Moore ) , crusty Captain Rafer Janders ( a splendid Richard Harris ) , and cynical racist Lieutenant Pieter Coetze ( a fine performance by Hardy Kruger ) . Faulkner and his troops manage to spring Limbani without a hitch , but are double-crossed by their employers and subsequently find themselves stuck in Africa with a vicious army of angry Simbas after them . Expertly directed with utmost brisk and tight efficiency by Andrew V . McLagen , with a sharp , witty script by Reginald Rose , a hard , gritty , no-nonsense tone ( Flynn makes a snotty young drug dealer eat a whole bag of bad smack ! ) , several stirring and well-mounted action sequences , a rousing score by Roy Budd , a wickedly sardonic sense of dry humor , handsome , polished cinematography by Jack Hilyard , and shocking outbursts of raw'n'bloody violence , this rip-roaring affair makes for hugely enjoyable all-star epic entertainment . The uniformly stellar acting from a tip-top cast rates as another major asset : Burton , Moore , Harris , and Kruger are all outstanding in the leads ; they receive sterling support from Stewart Granger as smarmy , stuffy banker Sir Edward Matherson , Jack Watson as hearty , but ruthless drill instructor Sandy Young , Kenneth Griffith as fey medical officer Arthur Witty , Frank Finlay as the feisty Father Geoghagen , Ronald Fraser as the scrappy Jack McTaggart , and Barry Foster as diplomatic liaison Thomas Balfour . Moreover , the characters are very complex and engaging ; you really learn to care about this rough'n'ready misfit band of professional soldiers for hire , which in turn makes all the combat and carnage that much more potent and gripping . An absolute corker .
518330	8239592	95863	9.0	An excellent sequel to the terrific original	Mike ( likable James LeGros ) and Reggie ( the equally affable Reggie Bannister ) hit the road in search of the Tall Man ( superbly essayed with sinister aplomb by Angus Scrimm ) . During their travels they pick up sassy hitchhiker Alchemy ( sultry brunette knockout Samantha Phillips ) and rescue sweet Liz ( gorgeous blonde babe Paula Irvine ) from the Tall Man's evil clutches . Writer / director Don Coscarelli maintains a constant brisk pace throughout , stages the action scenes with lipsmacking gusto , and expertly creates a potently brooding macabre gloom-doom atmosphere . Moreover , Coscarelli gives this picture a dreamy , funky , surreal free-form flowing vibe that's both hypnotic and compelling . In addition , there's a wealth of stunning visuals : a cemetery full of empty graves and the desolate abandoned streets of a dead ghost town are especially eerie and striking . LeGros and Bannister make for hugely appealing and convincing everyday guy heroes , Scrimm scores as a marvelously creepy villain , Irvine and Phillips are both absolutely lovely , and Kenneth Tiger lends fine support as weak alcoholic priest Father Meyers . Daryn Okado's glossy cinematography , the rousing spooky full-bore orchestral score by Fred Myrow and Christopher L . Stone , and Mark Shostrom's splendidly gruesome make-up f / x are all on the money strong and effective . Notable highlights include a hilarious rodeo sex scene between Reggie and Alchemy , Reggie engaging in a wild to-the-death chainsaw duel with one of the Tall Man's minions , and Reggie blowing away four of those nasty little dwarfs with a quadruple-barreled shotgun . A superior sequel .
518498	8239592	963194	9.0	A gloriously offbeat and inventive one-of-a-kind futuristic sci-fi musical marvel	In the bleak and hopeless near future a worldwide epidemic causes an alarming array of organ failures . The mighty and amoral biotech company GENECO rises to power by offering the desperate masses new organs . Folks who fail to keep up on their payments for their organs are targeted by the dreaded Repo Man . Bitter and ruthless GENECO founder Rotti Largo ( an excellent portrayal by Paul Sorvino ) is dying of a terminal disease . His grotesque kids - - vain , plastic surgery-obsessed daughter Amber Sweet ( a shockingly good Paris Hilton ) , deranged , bad-tempered son Luigi ( the always creepy Bill Moseley in his freaky element ) , and Luigi's infantile disfigured sibling Pavi ( the fine Ogre Nivek ) - - squabble amongst each other over who's going to inherent the family business . Meanwhile , frail and sickly teenage innocent Shilo Wallace ( an appealing turn by Alexa Vega ) is locked away in her house by her protective and overbearing doctor father Nathan ( a remarkable performance by Anthony Stewart Head ) . Unbeknownst to Shilo , Nathan works for Rotti as the Repo Man . Everything eventually comes to a full head at the incredible grandiose operatic conclusion . Director Darren Lynn Bousman , working from Darren Smith and Terrance Zdunich , expertly crafts a bold , wildly stylized and insanely imaginative brooding Gothic vision of a bleak and decaying future while relating a captivating story of love , betrayal , loyalty and dark family secrets . The cast sink their teeth into their juicy roles with tremendous go-for-it gusto and belt out the songs with comparable rip-snorting relish : Sorvino and Head shine as the two main adversaries , Hilton acquits herself well with her sizable supporting part , Zdunich has a total ball as the ghoulishly charming Graverobber , and Sarah Brightman is terrific as forlorn , yet glamorous GENECO spokeslady Blind Mag . Joseph White's dazzling cinematography gives the picture a stunning garish look ; the use of comic book panels for the flashbacks is an especially inspired touch . The songs are uniformly tasty and rousing , with the fiercely ripping " Testify " rating as the definite stirring stand-out tune . Moreover , we also get a handy helping of grisly gore to further spice up the already deliciously outrageous celluloid stew . A truly unique and impressive oddball cinematic achievement .
518500	8239592	75005	9.0	Worthy of its classic status	Ambitious American ambassador Robert Thorn ( an outstanding and dignified performance by the inestimable Gregory Peck ) begins to suspect that something is amiss with his adopted son Damien ( well played by gifted child thespian Harvey Stephens ) following a troubling series of odd and fatal " accidents . " Thorn and cynical photographer Keith Jennings ( the always excellent David Warner ) embark on an investigation which takes them all over Europe in order to uncover the truth about Damien's possibly satanic origins . Director Robert Donner and screenwriter David Seltzer give the fantastic supernatural premise a semblance of plausibility by firmly grounding said story in a believable everyday world . Moreover , Donner maintains a steady pace throughout , keeps the tone resolutely creepy and serious ( there's a welcome absence of any dumb and obtrusive humor ) , and stages a few elaborate murder set pieces with breathtaking go-for-it verve ( an impalement on a huge spike and a stunning decapitation by a large runaway pane of glass are especially effective while a cheery young nanny happily hanging herself at a birthday party proves to be genuinely shocking and disturbing ) . Better still , the special effects are used in an admirably judicious manner and the picture overall primarily relies on developing and sustaining a potently unsettling gloom-doom mood to get under the viewer's skin . The tension gradually builds to a nerve-wracking fever pitch and culminates in a truly harrowing last third . The uniformly sterling acting by a first-rate cast qualifies as another major asset : Peck and Lee Remick as Torn's sweet , yet frail wife Katherine bring a tremendous amount of class to the film , Billie Whitelaw gives a positively chilling portrayal of sinister governess Ms . Baylock , Patrick Troughton excels as intense priest Father Brennan , and Leo McKern contributes a neat cameo as occult expert Carl Bugenhagen . Kudos are also in order for Gilbert Taylor's glossy cinematography and Jerry Goldsmith's supremely shivery'n'spooky Oscar-winning score . A superior mainstream horror hit .
518911	8239592	71269	9.0	George Segal and Elliott Gould are both superb in Robert Altman's engrossing portrait of two compulsive gamblers	Bored divorced sadsack Bill Denny ( splendidly played by George Segal ) and brash , free-spirited wild card Charlie Waters ( the equally outstanding Elliott Gould ) are a couple of compulsive gamblers cursed with bad luck . The two join forces to turn fortune in their favor and follow an incredible steady winning streak all the way to Reno , Nevada for a high stakes poker game with reigning champion " Amarillo Slim " Preston where they put it all on the line for the largest jackpot score of their lives . Director Robert Altman , working from a bright , vivid and episodic script by Joseph Walsh , wisely opts not to glibly explain why both Denny and Waters are addicted to gambling ; instead Altman merely observes with bracing and unblinking acuity these two guys doing what they do and allows the viewers to come up with their own explanation for what motivates these fellows to constantly risk it all and live life on the edge . All the aspects of compulsive gambling are excitingly present and accounted for : The agony and despair of losing , the stirring fly-by-the-seat of your pants sense of recklessness when you place a major bet , the nerve-wracking stress of owing people piles of money , and the fleeting , albeit electric glory of hitting it big , plus an underlying feeling of blankness and fatalism bubbling just beneath the frantic surface . Segal and Gould display a marvelously breezy'n'easy natural and unforced chemistry that's a true joy to behold . Gwen Welles and Ann Prentiss are likewise extremely charming and attractive as a pair of cheery hookers . Popping up in standout supporting roles are Edward Walsh as a bullish , hot-tempered sore loser of a poker player , Bert Remsen as a frumpy transvestite , Jeff Goldblum as Denny's nerdy boss , Jay Fletcher as a jumpy parking lot robber , and screenwriter Walsh as Denny's sleazy , vicious loan shark . Paul Lohmann's grainy , hazy , yet polished cinematography , the vibrant , profane overlapping dialogue , the authentically seedy locations ( funky poker parlors , noisy horse racetracks , raucous boxing rings , a glitzy Reno casino ) , and Phyllis Shotwell's spare , bluesy score add substantially to the fascinatingly scroungy , but lively , funny and always compelling proceedings . A real treat .
517894	8239592	86610	9.0	A splendidly sick and surreal early 80's sci-fi / horror stunner	One of the more arrestingly off-beat " ALIEN " sci-fi / horror variants to materialize in the early to mid 80's , this compellingly uneasy combination of drearily conventional domestic drama and totally off-the-wall sci-fi / horror weirdness starts out fairly mundane , but eventually erupts into all-out credibility-be-damned jaw-dropping surrealism as its oddball plot unfolds . A man who was abducted by aliens returns home after a long absence and makes a faltering attempt at regaining his previous ordinary life with horrifically disastrous consequences for both himself and his family . Acting , direction and narrative coherence take a back seat to an alarming succession of increasingly daft , shocking and gloriously grotesque graphic set pieces : a luckless lady who's been brutally raped by a hideous extraterrestrial crab-like beast gives painful , life-taking birth to a fully grown man ( nasty ! ) in a truly gag-inducing scene , a half-human , half-alien guy causes a pay phone to melt after he touches it , comely French au pair girl and future James Bond movie starlet Maryam ( " The Living Daylights " ) d'Abo gets wrapped up in a cocoon that's located directly above the bathroom shower so she can be used as an incubator for alien eggs ( luckily the luscious Maryam gets to do two eye-popping and much-appreciated gratuitous nude scenes prior to meeting this ghastly fate ) , d'Abo's libidinous boyfriend winds up being mauled by a panther after being chased around the house by a dangerous animated toy tank ( yes , you read that correctly ) , and , in perhaps the film's single most stupendously strange sequence , a GI Joe doll gets blown up to normal man size so it can come to life and take out a snoopy old lady neighbor ( I'm honestly not making this crazy stuff up ) . Amid all this magnificently messed-up lunacy the movie's " you can't go back home " subtext somehow manages to acquire a certain cock-eyed poignancy that's in equal degrees oddly affecting and genuinely unnerving . Alas , this terrifically twisted and authentically outré treat was followed by a couple of dire , scarcely related by-the-numbers sequels which sadly lack the original's startlingly unpredictable free-form approach to telling a story .
518057	8239592	404325	9.0	A hysterically funny , quirky and original oddball sci-fi comedy riot	Homesick , alcoholic , shape-shifting , telekinetic nervous humanoid alien Phil just wants to go back to his own planet after crashlanding his spaceship on our strange and hostile world . While stranded on Earth Phil has many bizarre adventures which include befriending an astute , sympathetic talking beaver ( delightfully voiced by " SCTV " series vet Joe Flaherty ) , forming a Christian rock band ( Phil levitates while singing on stage ) , and eluding several nefarious government agents wearing plush fur coats who want to use Phil for evil means . As the above plot synopsis implies , what we got here is one marvelously funny , eccentric and wholly original one-of-a-kind sci-fi comic oddity . Writer / director / star Rob Stefaniuk displays a singularly engaging and idiosyncratic tongue-in-cheek sensibility that's a true wacky treat to behold . The humor is extremely flaky and off-center , but totally inspired and often sidesplitting . Moreover , Phil makes for a peculiarly endearing fish-out-of-water protagonist who has a certain sweet innocence and clumsiness to him that's impossible to dislike . The uniformly excellent performances from the terrific cast qualifies as another substantial plus , with especially winning turns by Boyd Banks as a macho redneck hunter , Nicole de Boer as an icy , but alluring freelance hit lady , Graham Greene as a gruff , unfriendly bartender , and Bruce Hunter as a boozy , burnt-out bumbling special agent . The nifty special effects , John Kastner's funky score , D . Gregor Hagey's bright , crisp cinematography , and the groovy jammin ' rock soundtrack further enhance the infectiously zany merriment of this fabulously flipped-out gem .
519403	8239592	75261	9.0	An excellent & imaginatively grotesque 70's killer animal winner	This exceptional killer worm flick marked the auspicious and impressive debut of great , shamefully unsung B-horror picture writer / director Jeff Lieberman , who followed up this slimy winner with the outstanding homicidal hippie acidhead landmark " Blue Sunshine " and the wickedly subversive , gender role reversal wackos-in-the-woods " Deliverance " variant " Just Before Dawn , " plus also blessed us with the nifty 80's direct-to-video item " Remote Control " and the recent funky hoot " Satan's Little Helper . " This skin-crawling delight rates highly as the best , creepiest and most deftly executed of the many revolt-of-nature fright films that were hugely popular and fashionable throughout the 70's . A whole lot of wriggling worms , juiced into a lethal , carnivorous , mankind-devouring frenzied mass by an electric cable downed in a fierce rain storm , nosh on the sleazy , boorish , hideously unfriendly local yokels which populate a drab little Georgia backwoods armpit hamlet . The premise sounds pretty awful , but Lieberman's hardy , adroit direction , wittily well-observed script , occasional dollops of wry black humor that sardonically poke fun at the plot's inherent absurdity ( skeptical good-for-nothing sheriff Peter MacLean first hears about the vicious invertebrates while ravenously eating a teeming plate of spaghetti , a truly inspired spoof of the famous " Psycho " shower sequence has worms instead of water seeping out of the shower head ) , and a welcome dearth of pompous , heavy-handed moralizing which tends to mar several similar nature-runs-amuck eco-scare tales ( e . g . , the horrendously portentous " Frogs " ) make a world of difference , thereby converting the unpromising plot into a most pleasant surprise indeed . Moreover , the worm attack set pieces are disgustingly convincing and thus quite jolting ( the horrific highlight occurs when vile redneck degenerate R . A . Dow has his face feasted on by the grody flesh-eating buggers ) , the refreshingly unmacho , but still resourceful Don ( " He Knows You're Alone " ) Scardino as the bright , bookish , hopelessly out-of-his-element college educated New York city boy hero and ravishing redhead Patricia ( " Cockfighter " ) Pearcy as Scardino's sweet , smart , fetching Southern belle girlfriend give nicely appealing performances , Joseph Mangine's crisp , evocative cinematography vividly captures a tangibly grungy and uninviting shabby small stickville town gone to seed atmosphere , Rick Baker's stand-out , often startling special make-up effects are typically first-rate ( a post chewed-up Dow , dubbed " Wormface , " makes for a notably ghastly sight to behold ) , there's a beautifully eerie opening credits sequence ( the odd , austere children's song played during the credits is positively haunting ) , and the all-around sound acting is up to snuff . All in all , this honey really makes the grade as a genuinely frightening and very satisfying terror treat .
518929	8239592	79668	9.0	An intense , excellent and absorbing crime drama	March 9th , 1963 : Cheery Detective Karl Hettinger ( marvelously played by John Savage ) and his amiable laid-back partner Ian Campbell ( an engaging Ted Danson in his film debut ) run afoul of two dangerous criminals - - shrewd , vicious , domineering Gregory Powell ( a remarkably reptilian James Woods in his breakthrough role ) and meek , passive , insecure Jimmy Smith ( a terrific portrayal by Franklyn Seales ) - - while making their usual rounds one fateful night . The hoodlums kidnap the two police officers and take them out into a remote onion field . Ian gets killed while Karl manages to get away . Karl suffers guilt over surviving the terrible incident while both Gregory and Jimmy use the legal system to their cruel advantage to avoid the death penalty . Firmly directed with laudable tact and assurance by Harold Becker , with a gritty script by Joseph Wambaugh , meticulously detailed period atmosphere , slick , vivid cinematography by Charles Rosher , rough , profane dialogue , a chilling , moody score by Emuir Deodato , and a raw , edgy and grimly plausible sense of compellingly sordid realism , this potent and poignant knockout packs a very strong and lingering emotional gut punch . The whole sequence in the onion field is positively nerve-rattling ( the scene where Jimmy starts screaming hysterically after Greg shoots Ian right in the mouth is especially harrowing ) . Savage , Danson , Woods and Seales are all outstanding in the lead parts ; they receive top-notch support from Ronny Cox as hard-nosed Sargent Pierce Brooks , Diane Hull as Karl's loyal wife Helen , Priscilla Pointer as Ian's caring mother Chrissie , David Huffman as fed-up , disillusioned District Attorney Phil Halpin , Christopher Lloyd as a cunning jailhouse lawyer , and Richard Herd as a cynical veteran beat cop . An absolute powerhouse .
518202	8239592	330950	9.0	A very fine and informative retrospective documentary	This fascinating and illuminating 52 minute retrospective documentary offers a wealth of tasty trivia about the making of Dario Argento's terrific horror cult classic " Suspiria . " The people interviewed in the doc are Argento , co-writer Daria Nicolodi , cinematographer Luciano Tovoli , Goblin band members Claudio Simonetti ( he sings all the creepy verses in the incredible score ) , Massimo Morante , Fabio Pignatelli , and Agostino Marangolo , and cast members Jessica Harper , Stefania Casini ( who readily acknowledges that she was thrilled to work with Argento ) , and the ever-quirky Udo Kier . Topics discussed herein are the origins of the story ( Nicolodi based the dance academy on an actual prestigious school that teaches the black arts ! ) , the elegant star presence of Joan Bennett , Goblin's fantastic freaky score , Argento's highly distinctive style , Tovoli's use of the soon-to-be obsolete Technicolor process to obtain the incredibly bold and vibrant color scheme that's featured in the film , Harper and Casini hitting it off on the set , that the movie is basically a dark fairy tale ( Argento cites the Walt Disney animated picture " Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs " as a major influence on " Suspiria " ) , and the ongoing legacy of the film . Moreover , Casini admits that her unforgettably brutal death scene was a nightmare to shoot and Kier confesses that someone read all his dialogue to him off screen for his sole scene in the movie . Essential viewing for fans of the film .
518607	8239592	149151	9.0	A very funny , delightful and affectionate treat	The funky , yet strictly second-tier British glam-rock band Strange Fruit breaks up at the end of the wild'n'wacky excess-ridden 70's . The individual band members go their separate ways and uncomfortably settle into lackluster middle age in the dull and uneventful 90's : morose keyboardist Stephen Rea winds up penniless and down on his luck , vain , neurotic , pretentious lead singer Bill Nighy tries ( and fails ) to pursue a floundering solo career , paranoid drummer Timothy Spall resides in obscurity on a remote farm so he can avoid paying a hefty back taxes debt , and surly bass player Jimmy Nail installs roofs for a living . Former loving groupie turned patient , understanding , long-suffering manager Juliet Aubrey gets the group back together for an ill-advised , largely ineffectual and hilariously disastrous twenty years later nostalgic reunion tour of Europe . Our lovably ragged bunch try gamely , but fumblingly to reignite a flame that once burned quite brightly back in the day . Scraggly zonked-out roadie Billy Connelly and cocky eager beaver young guitarist Hans Matheson tag along for the delightfully bumpy , trouble-plagued , but still ultimately rewarding and enjoyable ride . Director Brian Gibson shows tremendously infectious respect and adoration for both his amiably screwy characters in particular and loud , ringing , flamboyantly overblown preening 70's rock in general , this imbuing this affectionate little pip with an utterly engaging sense of big-hearted charm and tireless verve . The astute , sharply written script by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais likewise bristles with spot-on dry wit and finely observed moments of joyous on the road inanity , capturing a certain bittersweetly affecting and frequently uproarious vibe that gives the picture itself an irresistibly luminescent glow . Ashley Rowe's lovely , elegant cinematography ensures that the movie always looks quite visually sumptuous while the perfectly catchy and groovy music does the trick with right-on rockin ' flair and aplomb . Kudos also to the across-the-board terrific performances that vividly nail the burnt-out soul and tattered , but still fiercely beating heart of a past its prime has-been ragtag rock outfit desperate to regain its erstwhile evanescent glory in one final bid for big time success . All in all , this radiant and touching gem rates highly as one of the true seriocomic sleeper treats from the 90's .
518670	8239592	71110	9.0	My all-time favorite " Airport " film	I saw this delightfully hokey disaster treat after enduring a hellishly awful day at work and it sure as hell perked up my previously sagging spirits . I felt pretty damn secure and contented by the time the ending credits rolled , because by then I came to the realization that as bad as my cruddy job is ( and trust me it can be nightmarishly horrid at times ) , I've never , ever been subjected to a nerve-wracking ordeal half as harrowing as the grueling fix poor Karen Black finds herself in in this movie . I mean , Karen has got a really rough road to hoe : the co-pilot and radarman of the plane she's a stewardess on get creamed when a small private plane smacks into the cockpit , the captain gets blinded , the plane's leaking gasoline , and Black herself has to fly the bulky , creaking , floundering thing through hazardous mountainous terrain with only Mr . Steely Stalwart Iron Jaw himself Chuck Heston and lovably gruff " Airport " series perennial George Kennedy talking her through the trying endeavor over a faulty CB radio . Alright , so the whole story sounds hopelessly ridiculous - - and it is hopelessly ridiculous , to be brutally honest . Yet , it's the dead seriousness of the script , acting and direction , all done with that right-on clunky sincerity that gives 70's disaster features their cheesy greatness , which makes this endearingly earnest foolishness such top-rate tacky trash . Better still , the usual boring subplots that often clutter these pictures are pleasingly curtailed here ; the characters are neatly established with utmost briskness and the basic plot kicks in by the 30 minute mark , thereby keeping tedium at bay . Naturally , this darling boasts one hell of an all-star line-up : Efrem Zimbalist , Jr . , Roy Thinnes and Erik Estrada as the doomed flight crew , Sid Caeser , Norman Fell , Conrad Janis and Jerry Stiller as obnoxiously dorky middle-aged swingers , Nancy Olsen as a cute blonde stewardess , Dana Andrews , Linda Blair ( fresh from her smashing success in " The Exorcist " ) as a sickly , yet perky little girl who needs a new kidney or its Stiff City buddy , Larry Storch as a jerky scoop-chasing TV reporter , 50's AIP creature feature regulars Ed Nelson and Beverly Garland , Guy Stockwell , terminally insufferable pop singer Helen Reddy as an unbearably sweet nun , Gloria Swanson as herself , Myrna Loy , a pre - " Cagney and Lacey " Sharon Gless in a quick bit , Susan Clark , Martha Scott , and even " Assault on Precinct 13 " survivor Austin Stoker as an Air Force sergeant . All are tremendous fun to watch , but Karen Black clearly cops the top acting honors : permanently crossed saucer eyes wide with fright , a look of grim determination firmly fixed on her lovely face , and jaws tightly clenched , the extraordinary Ms . Black gives the kind of remarkably committed performance which inadvertently exposes this howler as the idiotic junk that it truly is . Swanson likewise maintains her composure throughout , displaying a poise and classiness that's jarringly at odds with everyone else's sweaty , gritty , panic-stricken histrionics . Veteran bungler Jack Smight , the same all-thumbs dude responsible for the incredibly atrocious post-nuke sci-fi dud " Damnation Alley , " directed this sucker with his customary artless rent-a-hack craftsmanship . Smight's totally straight-faced dimestore workmanlike efficiency works like gangbusters for this entertainingly dopey nonsense , thus clinching this honey's sterling status as a super schlocky slice of airborne 70's thrills'n'spills absurdity .
519159	8239592	430950	9.0	An excellent retrospective documentary	This strong and engrossing retrospective documentary on the making of " Conan the Barbarian " covers the film from its genesis to its theatrical release , with a lot of especially interesting information about the rigorous shooting of the picture in Spain . Among the people interviewed are intelligent and articulate co-writer / director John Milius , charismatic star Arnold Schwarzenegger , lovely and athletic female lead Sandahl Bergman , the ever-affable James Earl Jones , champion surfer Gerry Lopez , Max von Sydow ( who agreed to do the role of King Osric because it gave him a chance to have fun and ham it up ! ) , genial production designer Ron Cobb , outspoken co-writer Oliver Stone , producer Dino de Laurentiis and his daughter Raffaella , stunt coordinator Terry Leonard , executive producer Edward R . Pressman , and ace composer Basil Poledouris ( whose amazing score is smartly retained for the doc ) . Among the anecdotes related are the casting of Arnold as Conan , the extensive training the leads had to do prior to making the film , the giant animatronic snake , Bergman almost having her index finger cut off during a sword fight scene , Milius striving to make the violence as brutal and realistic as possible ( the movie actually had to be resubmitted to the MPAA three times before it got an " R " rating ! ) , the tremendous box office success of the film , and how the picture was supposed to be the first in an ongoing series of movies . This fine and illuminating documentary is absolutely essential viewing for fans of the film .
518941	8239592	343563	9.0	An impressive and effective little indie drama gem	I recently caught this nice little 27 minute indie college student thesis movie drama at a short film festival held in my hometown of Metuchen , New Jersey . It tells in a very stark and absorbing manner the simple story of an aging cutman ( exceptionally well played by Jack McCormack ) who gets fired from his job of tending to boxers who get severely roughed up in the ring . The cutman tries to reassert himself back into his estranged successful doctor son's life and attempts to get his old job back . Writer / director Yon Motskin uses a very strikingly polished and assured visual style in relating this poignant anecdote , offering a touching , arresting and admirably unsentimental portrait of a proud , stubborn and weary old man who's life and profession are coming to a close . Motskin's greatly assisted by the lovely and stunning cinematography by Andrij Parekh , the haunting music score , a tightly plotted narrative , gritty New York City locations , and uniformly fine naturalistic acting from a solid cast ( McCormack in particular is terrific , displaying a whole lifetime of pain , regret and anguish in a marvelously subtle and understated performance ) . An impressive debut effort .
519410	8239592	59311	9.0	An arrestingly off-beat & atmospheric mid 60's horror oddity	Do you speak Esperanto ? Well , I sure don't . But fortunately this intriguingly quirky and moody horror oddity - - the only motion picture ever made using the still active experimental universal language of Esperanto - - comes complete with subtitles . On a remote and mysterious magical island populated by dangerous demons and seductive spirits the beautiful and ambitious young sea siren Kia ( the lovely and enchanting Allyson Ames ) gets bored with sending wayward souls to hell , so she decides to go after bigger and more demanding game by leading the good and virtuous Marc ( the one and only William Shatner in a surprisingly sturdy and subdued performance ) astray with lust . When Marc instead corrupts Kia with the purity of his love , the enraged Kia summons a lethal demonic being ( effectively embodied by the handsome and muscular Milos Milos ) to rape Marc's equally upstanding younger sister Arndis ( the cute and appealing Ann Atmar ) and thus provoke Marc to kill the incubus out of revenge , thereby tainting his soul through violence . Deftly written and directed by " The Outer Limits " TV series creator Leslie Stevens , strikingly photographed in exquisitely sharp and stark black and white by the great Conrad Hall , rich in eerie otherworldly atmosphere and further graced by gorgeous misty forest locations , this compelling , intelligent and provocative fright film parable about faith , corruption , redemption and temptation makes for extremely fascinating and stimulating viewing . Fresh , original and highly recommended .
518879	8239592	72403	9.0	An excellent , exciting and provocative period action / adventure winner	1896 : A motley trio of whalers - - gruff , hostile , alcoholic third-mate Billy ( a wonderfully crotchety Warren Oates ) , gentle , humane cabin boy Daggett ( a lovely , moving performance by Timothy Bottoms ) , and fidgety harpooner Portagee ( the always fine Lou Gossett ) - - get stranded in the Artic after their boat crashes against some ice . The threesome are rescued by and subsequently adopted into a tribe of friendly , helpful , religious Eskimos . Everything goes well for a while . However , the whalers ' assimilation into the tribe and its customs proves to be quite rocky : they assist the Eskimos in hunting seals , sleep with numerous Eskimo women , engage in wrestling matches and knife throwing contests , are marked as bearers of bad tidings by a powerful Eskimo medicine man after a series of misfortunes befall the tribe , and make a fruitless attempt at getting back to civilization by stealing an Eskimo boat ( they also swipe some fish as well ) . Eventually the whalers ' opposing cultural backgrounds and differing ethical beliefs cause them to have a fierce , bitter dispute with the tribe , which in turn begets violent , tragic consequences for the unsuspecting trio . " The White Dawn " works superbly on two levels : 1 ) a rousing , rugged , totally plausible and absorbing braving the elements action / adventure feature which gives the viewer a tasteful , thoughtful , utterly fascinating look at a unique , intriguing culture that's for the most part grossly ignored and under-explored in cinema and 2 ) a trenchant , ultimately ironic examination of the fear , ignorance and ridiculous superstitions which are key components of racism and , more revealingly , significant reasons for why distinct cultures can and do clash . Assuredly directed with a clear , sharp eye for minute details by Phillip Kaufman , astutely written by James Houston and Tom Rickman , gorgeously photographed in stunning panoramic scope by Michael Chapman and scored with appropriate elegance and majestic orchestral sweep by Henry Mancini , this cracking good yarn sizes up as a colorful , enthralling and very provocative little knockout .
518938	8239592	45877	9.0	A superb , gripping and suspenseful 50's film noir thriller gem	Gilbert Bowen ( finely played by Frank Lovejoy ) and Roy Collins ( the equally excellent Edmund O'Brien ) are a couple of pleasant , personable working class family men who are out on a fishing trip driving across Mexico in a Plymouth Fury . The two good lifelong friends make the fatal mistake of picking up Emmett Myers ( a chillingly flinty and implacable performance by rangy , gaunt-faced character actor William Talman ; the DA who inevitably lost every case to Raymond Burr on " Perry Mason " ) , a mean , sadistic , cold-hearted on the lam psychopathic criminal who takes the pair hostage and makes them transport him across the border with the specific intent of killing both men after they prove to be no longer useful . Gilbert and Ray's friendship gets put to the ultimate test by Myers : they either will pull together to defeat him or both wind up dead . A truly tense and gripping low-budget vintage 50's stripped down to the scrappy bare essentials film noir thriller which delivers 71 minutes worth of sweat-inducing white-knuckle tension , this " danger on the road " classic greatly benefits from Ida Lupino's trim , focused , unflashy direction ( Lupino also co-wrote the compact script ) , the nervy interplay between the three outstanding leads , the lean , but richly textured characters , Leith Stevens ' marvelously booming'n'bombastic all urgent horns and fraught strings score , a starkly plotted narrative which stays on a steady , unwavering course throughout , Nicholas Musuraca's gorgeously crisp black and white cinematography , no needless pretense or sentiment to speak of , and a hard , grim , steely tone that's firmly rooted in a quietly unsettling evocation of a fragile , all too easily ripped asunder everyday tranquility and banality . The film's marrow-freezing plausibility no doubt derives from the fact that the story was inspired by a horrific real life incident : In the early 50's a hoodlum fugitive named William Cook posed as a hitch-hiker and killed several people who gave him a lift before the police caught him .
518668	8239592	87799	10.0	It's the end of the world as we know it - - and it's like so totally rad , y'know ? !	Tough , smart Los Angeles resident Regina ( smoking hot brunette Catherine Mary Stewart of " The Last Starfighter " ) and her flighty younger sister Samantha ( adorably bubbly blonde sprite Kelli Maroney of " Fast Times at Ridgemont High " ) are amongst a small handful of folks left alive after the bulk of the planet's population are turned into red dust by a passing comet . Other survivors include " Eating Raoul " ' s Robert Beltran as a hunky nice guy truck driver , your standard assortment of hostile rot-faced , sunken-eyed zombies , a vicious gang of nihilistic punk psycho stock boys , and a team of evil mad scientists who include the ever-twitchy Geoffrey Lewis and ravishing femme fatale supreme Mary Woronov . Writer / director Thom Eberhardt takes an unpromisingly generic sci-fi / horror end-of-the-world premise and gives it a marvelously clever , witty and inspired tongue-in-cheek hip'n'flip 80's makeover : the characters are refreshingly humane and engaging , the witty dialogue frequently hits the sidesplitting snappy spot ( " Hey , I'm sorry if the end of the world makes me nervous " ) , the New Wave rock soundtrack seriously smokes , and in the film's single most delightful sequence Regina and Samantha joyfully ransack a swank department store for all the gnarly fashionable clothes they can get their eager little adolescent hands on ( appropriately enough , " Girls Just Wanna Have Fun " plays on the soundtrack during this simply spectacular sequence which speaks volumes about the shallow materialistic culture of the 80's . Instead of stockpiling essential things like food and water these girls amass a large array of trendy apparel ) . Better still , there's a wonderfully natural and appealing breezy'n'easy chemistry between Stewart and Maroney ; their sweet , lively and often amusing rapport keeps the picture fun and bouncy throughout . Furthermore , the eerie shots of the empty and abandoned desolate city streets are quite striking and the ferocious zombies deliver several truly creepy and startling moments . Popping up in cool cameos are Michael ( " Forbidden World , " " Valley Girl " ) Bowen as an early victim , Ivan E . Roth as the terrifying leader of the psycho stock boys , and Sharon Farrell as the girls ' bitchy stepmom . Arthur Albert's crisp , handsome cinematography ( the use of funky dusky red filters is especially impressive and effective ) , David Richard Campbell's nifty spacey synthesizer score , and David Miller's neat make-up f / x are all on the money excellent . A total blast .
518732	8239592	210070	10.0	One of the best , most moving and inspired horror films of the early 21st century	Brash hottie redhead Ginger ( a fabulously tart and ferocious performance by the stunningly gorgeous Katharine Isabelle ) and her more plain mousy brunette sister Brigitte ( superbly played by Emily Perkins ) are a couple of weird withdrawn death-infatuated misfit Goth outsider girls living in a stuffy suburban town . A mysterious wild animal has been killing dogs in the neighborhood . One fateful night Ginger gets attacked and bitten by the vicious animal . The animal turns out to be a genuine werewolf . Pretty soon Ginger begins to radically transform , becoming increasingly outgoing , aggressive and even dangerous . It's up to Brigitte and nice guy pot dealer Sam ( a winning portrayal by Kris Lemche ) to figure out a way to cure Ginger's curse before it's too late . Ably directed by John Fawcett , with a strikingly original , intelligent and insightful script by Karen Walton , a supremely eerie and melancholy tone , bright , sparkling , polished cinematography by Thom Best , plenty of truly jolting shocks ( the sequence where Ginger gets mauled is positively harrowing ; another bitterly ironic moment involving an unexpected accidental death in a kitchen is likewise quite jarring ) , a heart-breakingly tragic conclusion , a refreshingly honest and gritty depiction of how messed-up teenagers can be ( the kids in this flick swear a lot , have sex and do drugs , all of which are crucial components of adolescence ) , and a beautifully brooding and moody score by Michael Shields , " Ginger Snaps " turns the werewolf premise right on its ear , using the concept of the lycanthrope as an extremely potent , penetrating and provocative metaphor for the onset of puberty and the painful awkwardness of adolescent growing pains ( Ginger's metamorphosis into a werewolf corresponds with the beginning of her menstrual cycle and subsequent budding of her newfound empowering sexuality ) . Better still , there are even pointed references to such classic fairy tales as " Goldie Locks and the Three Bears , " " The Three Little Pigs , " and especially " Little Red Riding Hood . " The fact that Ginger is both scared and excited by her sudden abnormal dramatic changes qualifies as another smart and effective touch . But what really gives this picture its greatness is the wonderfully astute , moving and above all credible relationship between Ginger and Brigitte . Perkins and Isabelle are both outstanding in the leads , with equally excellent support from Lemche ( who not only serves as Brigitte's love interest , but also ultimately comes through as an engagingly unlikely hero ) , Mimi Rogers as the girls ' blithely clueless mother Pamela , Jesse Moss as thuggish jock Jason , and Danielle Hampton as stuck-up popular girl Trini . An absolute corker .
519200	8239592	71266	10.0	A simply spectacular 70's women-in-prison drive-in gem	Jonathan Demme's directorial debut for Roger Corman's legendary exploitation outfit New World Pictures rates highly as one of the finest chicks-in-chains 70's grindhouse classics to ever grace celluloid . Beauteous Russ Meyer starlet Eric ( " Vixen , " " Beyond the Valley of the Dolls " ) Gavin gives a robust , winning performance as a brassy , resilient new fish who does her best to persevere in a grimy , hellish penitentiary . The always fabulous Barbara Steele offers a deliciously wicked portrayal as the mean , crippled , sexually frustrated warden ( her erotic dream about doing a slow , steamy striptease in front of the lady inmates is a real dilly ) . Longtime favorite 70's B-movie actress Roberta ( " The Arousers , " " Unholy Rollers " ) Collins delivers a hilariously raunchy and endearing turn as a cheerfully forward , foul-mouthed kleptomaniac felon who tells a gut-busting dirty joke about Pinnochio . Lynda Gold ( a . k . a . Crystin Sinclaire of Tobe Hooper's " Eaten Alive " and Curtis Harrington's " Ruby " ) makes her lively film debut as uninhibited wildcat Crazy Alice . And the ever-cuddly Cheryl " Rainbeaux " Smith does a lovely , touching reprise of her fragile frightened innocent role from " Lemora : A Child's Tale of the Supernatural . " Although this picture does deliver the expected ample amount of coarse language , nudity , rape and violence , it's still by no means a typically crass and sexist piece of lurid mindless filth ; the movie very effectively explores the many ways in which men cruelly exploit women and strongly asserts the pro-feminist notion that women can overcome any obstacles if they band together into a group so they can bravely face their misogynistic oppressors as one mighty fighting force . Demme's zesty , confidant direction comes through with a glorious abundance of astutely observed incidental details and delightful moments of engagingly quirky human behavior . Furthermore , both Tak Fujimoto's vibrant cinematography and John Cale's marvelously dolorous oddball blues score are 100 % on the money excellent . Patrick Wright ( Sheriff Mack in the uproariously awful cheap-rubber-monster-suit creature feature howler " Track of the Moonbeast " ) has a sidesplitting bit as a jerky cop who has his car stolen by a trio of prison escapees when he stops at a gas station to use the bathroom . Lively , rousing and immensely enjoyable , " Caged Heat " qualifies as absolutely essential viewing for 70's drive-in movie fans .
518132	8239592	121694	10.0	An absolutely astonishing camp riot	This astoundingly abysmal piece of unmitigated schlock rates highly as one of the single most sublimely stupid and sidesplitting kitsch hoots I've had the pleasure to watch in quite a while . An evil drug lord uses a bunch of rot-faced hopping vampires to retain his power . Narcotics agent Tom Wilde gets shot and killed in the line of duty . He's brought back to life as a lethal and unstoppable cyborg who looks like he's been wrapped from head to toe in bright shiny tin foil . Meanwhile a macho meathead mercenary guy battles dope dealers in the jungle who have abducted a beautiful blonde babe agent . Boy , does this jaw-dropping dreadful doozy possess all the correct so - utterly - wrong - that - they're - paradoxically - right stuff to qualify as a real four-star stinkeroonie : fumbling ( mis ) direction , priceless dopey dialogue ( favorite line : " Kill the priest , quick ! " ) , ineptly staged shoot-outs , hilariously horrible dubbing , plentiful gut-busting over-the-top chopysocky fight scenes , broadly drawn characters , horrendously hammy acting , a silly romantic subplot involving the head vampire guy who can fire sparks from his fingertips and a sexy ghost girl wearing a semi-transparent gown ( said sexy ghost girl is obviously doubled by a man during her more strenuous fight scenes ! ) , a generic hum'n'shiver synthesizer score , outrageously gruesome , yet tacky gore , a rambling and barely coherent narrative ( this flick is clearly two separate movies which have been sloppily edited together ) , a nonstop frantic pace , and a seriously messed-up story that clumsily combines elements of horror , action , martial arts , crime thriller and even comedy into a spectacularly ungodly brew . An undeniably awful , but often uproarious and always immensely entertaining serving of infectiously inane celluloid lunacy .
518348	8239592	67525	10.0	It's the end of the world with Chuck Heston - - and it's a total groove , baby !	Richard Matheson's terrific novel " I Am Legend " has been twice adapted for the big screen . The first adaptation was " The Last Man on Earth , " an unsparingly grim'n'gloomy Italian mid 60's Gothic horror outing starring Vincent Price . " The Omega Man " on the other hand is a lively undead corpse of an altogether separate hue - - and it's one rip-roaringly loud , gaudy , tripped-out funky-a blinding Day-Glow color at that . Yep , this American made sci-fi / action baby only retains the central premise of Matheson's book , embellishing greatly on the story so it can snazzily cater to all the hip'n'happening trends of the early 70's . The film serves as a wildly distorted and hugely entertaining funhouse mirror reflection of the heady early 70's and nowadays naturally represents a hopelessly dated , yet still oddly charming time capsule of a bygone era . A terrible plague has wiped out most of mankind and turned the bulk of folks who are still alive into crazed albino mutants . Famed NRA spokesman and archetypal post-nuke sci-fi / action survivalist icon par excellence Charlton Heston portrays with his customary steely resolve and firm granite jaw one Robert Neville , an unattached , sardonically wisecracking , rough'n'tumble machine gun-toting bachelor scientist who lives in an eerily empty and desolate Los Angeles along with a lethal bunch of the evil albino mutants . Led by former TV newscaster turned Charles Manson-style cult leader Matthias ( deliciously essayed with lip-smacking hammy relish by veteran villainous character actor Anthony Zerbe ) , the smart , calculating , shades-wearing nocturnal albino mutants call themselves " brother " and " sister , " wear cowled black robes which make them resemble deranged monks , use bows and arrows as weapons , and wish to destroy all remnants of modern society so they can create a new technology-free medieval world . These gloriously gaga freaks come across like a marvelously malign cross between the Manson Family and the Black Panthers . Meanwhile our carefree and nonchalant human hero Heston tools around the barren ruins of LA in a fancy convertible while blasting the sappy theme of " A Summer Place " on his 8-track stereo ( ! ) , treats himself to countless free showings of " Woodstock , " blithely blows away lots of mutants with his trusty machine gun , sips fine wine and plays chess with himself , and has a steamy interracial affair with a spunky black lady survivor ( the delightful Rosalind Cash , sporting a jumbo Afro that would make Pam Grier blush ) . Heston runs across a handful of mellow hippie kids led by motorcycle-riding longhair Paul Koslo who have all somehow managed to avoid being infected by the disease . It gets better . WARNING : Big old nasty SPOILER ahead . The film ends on a ridiculous optimistic note with Heston being done in by a spear-tossing Matthias ; a serum made from his blood is left behind to cure the survivors . Best of all , Heston croaks with his arms outstretched in a cheesy Jesus Christ on the cross posture , a self-deifying image that's further hammered home by a tacky solarized final freeze frame . The closing visual reveals the entire picture to be nothing more than a silly , thinly veiled Christ allegory . Yep , the basic tone strongly adheres to an extremely conventional and conservative Christian mentality , a giddy upbeat mindset which in turn makes this amazing item an absolute four-star camp hoot of the highest order . The scenes of Heston roaming through the bleak and abandoned city streets are wonderfully bizarre and haunting , highlighted by Heston's extraordinary " the phone isn't ringing " crack-up scene . It's this pervasive straight-faced sense of total inside-out strangeness which gives this fabulously flipped-out film its peculiarly irresistible oddball appeal .
518625	8239592	67490	10.0	One of the all-time great 70's made-for-TV horror movies	Darren McGavin gives a wonderfully robust and engaging performance as Carl Kolchak , an abrasive , impetuous , impulsive , and excitable down-on-his-luck newspaper reporter who uncovers the scoop of a lifetime after he finds out that Janos Skorzeny ( a genuinely frightening portrayal by Barry Atwater ) , the man responsible for a vicious series of baffling murders in Las Vegas , is an actual vampire . Expertly directed with topmost brisk efficiency by John Llewllyn Moxey ( who also gave us the well-regarded early 60's gem " Horror Hotel " ) , with a sharp and witty script by noted writer Richard Matheson , a constant frantic pace , plenty of tension ( the big confrontation between Kolchak and Skorzeny is especially harrowing ) , a wickedly amusing sense of cynical humor , several rousing rough'n'tumble action set pieces , and a realistic downbeat ending , this bang-up little winner makes for an incredibly gripping , scary , and flat-out entertaining treat . The first-rate acting from a stellar cast of seasoned pros constitutes as another significant asset : Carol Lynley as Kolchak's loyal , concerned gal pal Gail Foster , Simon Oakland as Kolchak's irascible , long-suffering superior Tony Vincenzo , Ralph Meeker as affable FBI agent Bernie Jenks , Claude Akins as the huffy Sheriff Warren A . Butcher , Charles McGraw as the crusty Police Chief Ed Masterson , Elisha Cook , Jr . as wormy informant Mickey Crawford , Kent Smith as the severe District Attorney Tom Paine , Larry Linville as puzzled coroner Dr . Robert Makurji , and Stanley Adams as fast-talking used car salesman Fred Hurley . Michael Hugo's crisp , polished cinematography accurately nails the blinding gaudiness of the Las Vegas setting ( said Vegas setting is a truly inspired stroke of genius , with the city's notorious reputation for sucking tourists ' wallets dry serving as an ideal counterpart to Skorzeny's literal bloodsucking rampage ) . Bob Cobert's groovy-spooky score likewise hits the funky spot . Moreover , the violence is really brutal and intense for an early 70's made-for-TV picture ( Skorzeny calmly breaks a large dog's neck in one particularly chilling scene ! ) . With his battered straw hat , rumpled suit , and aggressively opportunistic go-getter sensibility , McGavin's Carl Kolchak qualifies as a highly likable , if unlikely and pretty scrappy everyman hero . Totally worthy of its cult classic status .
518722	8239592	183884	10.0	A simply stupendous early 60's end-of-the-world sci-fi scream	This endearingly earnest , but hopelessly ham-fisted early 60's $1 . 98 poverty row sci-fi end-of-the-world doomsday thriller plays today like a four-star funny laugh-a-minute high camp exercise in hilariously hysterical Cold War era paranoia . The minimalistic setting is the side of a desolate desert backroad . The time is 4 : 00 a . m . in the morning a few days before Christmas . Stalwart , upright , fiercely by-the-book Deputy Sheriff Dan Colter ( a ridiculously rigid and stolid performance by stocky , poker-faced Seaman Glass , who later had small roles in " Deliverance , " " Damnation Alley , " and " The Rose " ) hears about an impending nuclear war over his police radio . Colter pulls over a motley group of folks to prepare them for the forthcoming holocaust . This colorfully varied bunch represent a cross section of white middle class America : a crotchety old man and his equally feisty cutie pie grand daughter , a bickering middle-aged couple , a hot-headed truck driver , a couple of jive-talking hipsters , a speed crazy teenybopper , and , in a desperate attempt to milk a few extra dollops of suspense from this already tense scenario , a murderous young fugitive criminal guy . These pleasantly insipid one-note ciphers argue , fret , drink booze , fight , make out , get all histrionic , become unglued at the seams , commit suicide , gather food and water rations , convert a truck trailer into a makeshift bomb shelter ( ! ) , and sweat out the inevitable . Moreover , Colter kills an adorable puppy dog in order to conserve air ( ! ) and fends off a gang of hostile looters . Brick Marquard's grainy , gritty , starkly plain and unadorned cinematography brings a semblance of naturalistic conviction to this otherwise delightfully overwrought affair , a quality not apparent in Frederic Gadete's ponderous direction , the stiffly sincere acting from a game no-name cast , Greig McRitchie's uproariously inappropriate swinging beatnik jazz score , the tin-eared dialogue ( " Don't let this badge happy cat bug ya " ) , and the silly , pulpy , well-meaning script ( Gadete also co-wrote this howler with Peter Abenheim and Betty Lasky ) . A marvelously clumsy hoot with an appealingly naive mentality about mankind and Armageddon which in turn gives this lovably off-beat period artifact a certain irresistibly quaint charm .
518356	8239592	75923	10.0	A very powerful and poignant 70's made-for-TV drama classic	Troubled , confused , insecure teenager Richie ( a stunningly fine and moving performance by Robbie Benson ) feels unloved , unwanted and alienated , so he becomes dangerously involved with drugs . His stern , abusive , overbearing father ( superbly played by Ben Gazzara ) and overprotective mother ( the equally excellent Eileen Brennan ) try to help Richie , but when conventional methods of aid prove ineffectual poor Richie's drug habit spirals out of control , thereby leading to a shocking and tragic conclusion . Splendidly directed with great care and restraint by Paul Wendkos , with a smart , thoughtful and commendably unsentimental script by John McGreevey , slick photography by Robert B . Hauser , and a spare , melancholy score by Fred Karlin , this strong and gripping cautionary tale about the perils of drug addiction and the severe damage it can inflict on a family packs quite a devastating emotional punch . Besides addressing drug addiction with admirable acuity and matter-of-factness , this film further illustrates the damage wrought by the lack of intimacy and communication between kids and their parents . If Richie's father especially hadn't been so strict and spent more time with his son , then maybe he would have never turned to drugs to alleviate his pain and frustration . Benson and Gazzara are exceptional in their demanding parts . They receive terrific support from Lance Kerwin as Richie's concerned younger brother , Cindy Eibacher as Richie's sweet girlfriend , and Charles Fleischer and Clint Howard as two of Richie's druggie pals ( peer pressure also clearly plays a substantial part in Richie's descent into substance abuse ) . Heartbreaking and unforgettable , " The Death of Richie " rates highly as an extremely poignant and hauntingly sad 70's made-for-TV movie classic which has lost none of its considerable potency throughout the years .
518603	8239592	89912	10.0	The true reason cinema was invented . An absolute celluloid masterpiece of exceptional subtlety and profound artistic significance	As the extremely subtle , tasteful and artistic title alone suggests , this here is one of those unsung cinematic masterpieces , a monumentally important and incisive cinematic landmark of tremendous cultural significance , a profound and provocative rumination on the complex multi-faceted tenets of the human condition , sheer celluloid poetry . . . hey , who the hell am I fooling ? Scratch that high-faluting nonsense . As the extraordinarily asinine title truly suggests , this steaming hunk of utterly worthless and artless cinematic offal is a sublimely shoddy , silly and downright stupid slice of slapdash spoofy sci-fi piffle any avid connoisseur of sheer celluloid detritus should relish every last dopey , dunced-out dreckoid minute of . The so-called " plot " plumbs startling new depths in the history of " you gotta be kidding me ! " celluloid idiocy : A luscious quartet of predatory and temperamental outer space babes land in the sleepy hamlet of Mayfield to find hunky attractive teenage fellows to mate with . Any person who ticks off the hot'n'horny extraterrestrial honeys gets transformed into gigantic humanoid vegetables such as carrots , pickles , tomatoes , zucchinis , and even squash ! It's up to the boys ' insanely jealous and possessive girlfriends to thwart the perniciously seductive distaff alien menace . Okay , witty and sophisticated the story sure ain't , but frankly who cares about that highbrow artsy crap ? In place of that stuff we got a meandering narrative , mostly decent acting from a game no-name cast , a bevy of nice-looking chicks in skimpy outfits , a goofy synthesizer score set to a thumpin ' disco beat , a touching subplot concerning one alien mother getting to know the psychic half-human son she had 16 years ago ( oh the pathos ! ) , lots of dumb dialogue ( sample line : " Wait a minute - - this is ridiculous ! " ) , chintzy ( far from ) special effects , and cheapo production values that are just a step or two above a homemade stag movie . Granted , this doozy never matches the sidesplitting lunacy of the brilliantly berserk " Invasion of the Girl Snatchers , " but it's still an amiably brainless and hugely enjoyable piece of inconsequential fluff all the same .
