518367	8239592	90582	1.0	A most appropriately titled poverty row horror atrocity	Man , oh man , does the title for this horrendous hunk of low-budget gore-drenched horror junk aptly sum up the appalling dearth of quality to be found herein . A huge , toothy , tentacled carnivorous beast forces a dorky , peevish , totally unlikeable and unappealing wimpy teenage boy with dark sunglasses and a terribly unattractive shaggy hair cut ( the obnoxious Scott Davis ) to viciously kill a plethora of poor innocent folks so the foul thingie can ravenously devour their crunchy , scrumptious bodies . Yummy , yummy , yummy ! Everything about this shot-in-Super 8 atrocity wallows in the gutter-dwelling Amateur City dumps : we've got profoundly putrid acting , ugly , grainy , static cinematography by Richard Strait , awful ( non ) direction by Bret McCormick ( hiding behind the pseudonym Max Raven ) , a gruelingly draggy pace , Davis ' exceptionally lame stream-of-consciousness voice over commentary ( for your intense viewing displeasure Davis ' trebly mewling tenor affects a piercing nasal whine that could shatter immense sets of fine china if it was cranked up a few decibels higher ) , an excruciatingly high-pitched , melodramatic , extremely tough-on-the-ears score by Kim and Richard Davis and John Hudek , a phony-looking monster that's a really sad sight to behold , an inane opening nightmare montage which tersely sums up the entire plot and thus robs the rest of the picture of any suspense or surprises ( ! ) , and the messy , disjointed narrative is not only hard to stomach , but also difficult to follow as well . Granted , the outrageously moist and juicy make-up effects by Dark FX LTD . are suitably gruesome - - sliced open throats emit a copious jet stream of blood , a guy gets fatally whacked upside the head with a shovel , some old bat has her hand bitten off by the monster , the sniveling limp dishrag kid uses a pitchfork to feed the beast a handy helping of gleaming guts , that sort of sweet , charming , harmless stuff - - but alas are too hokey to be remotely convincing or upsetting . Early in the flick our utterly unsympathetic passive protagonist remarks , " I thought I was gonna vomit . " Yeah , I felt like puking too , buddy , primarily because this flick is so dishearteningly shoddy and ridiculous that not even a hardened bad film buff like yours truly can discern anything faintly enjoyable or entertaining about it . It's a complete , indefensible loser .
519164	8239592	129358	1.0	A total stinker	Sasquatch spent most of the 90s toiling away in such horrendously lame'n'tame children's movie bilge as " Little Bigfoot , " " Bigfoot : The Unforgettable Encounter , " and " Big and Hairy , " which makes this regional redneck horror / action hybrid a definite anomaly , but still nothing to get all excited about . In the misty backwoods of the Okaloosa Wilderness in Annistan , Alabama , a local Bigfoot creature murders the son of all-powerful rich jerk Milton St . John ( an embarrassingly poor turn by bona-fide exploitation legend David F . Friedman ) . St . John bankrolls an expedition led by insipid nice guy Dr . David Stone ( semi-sentient walking spam chunk Rick Montana in a stupendously lousy non-performance ) to find the foul fiend . Unbeknownst to Stone , the other members of the team are a stereotypically gung-ho , trigger-happy bunch of hillbilly yahoos specifically hired by St . John to bag the beast . R . G . Arledge's lax , ham-fisted direction strikes out in every conceivable department , thereby sinking this leaden bomb to an unforgivably schlocky sub-level of rank amateurishness : the sluggish pacing , putrid acting , wafer-thin cardboard characters , ill-judged stabs at lowbrow humor , the huge letdown creature ( it's some heavy-stepping zhlub in a rubber ghoul mask and black gorilla costume ) , weak off-screen killings , and dissatisfying sudden'n'senseless ending all leave a great deal to be desired . Those looking for a fun , worthwhile Bigfoot flick are strongly advised to search elsewhere .
518466	8239592	80346	1.0	Brain-numbingly atrocious no-budget zombie abomination	I must admit that I have this strange grudging respect for the ridiculously prolific and chronically ham-fisted schlock movie master Fred Olen Ray . Sure , a majority of Fred's flicks are total crap , but I still admire the tireless , albeit hopeless Mr . Ray for trying again and again and again to produce a halfway decent picture . I honestly think Fred gives his proverbial all to any given Grade Z dreckfest that he labors on ; the key problem is Fred's so-called " all " doesn't amount to diddly squat quality wise . Still , like I said before , at least the guy tries . " The Alien Dead " was Fred's second disastrously woebegone foray into pure cinematic sludge right after the still unreleased " The Brain Leeches " and it's probably one of the all-time worst pieces of witless'n'worthless celluloid swill Fred has ever regurgitated upon a hapless , unsuspecting public . the banal , no big freakin ' deal plot copiously rips off both " Night of the Living Dead " and " Shock Waves " : A fallen meteorite causes a bunch of bayou bumpkins to plumb mutate into ferocious , rot-faced , amphibious cannibalistic zombies who attack and devour lots of totally deserving hillbilly dorks and dorkettes in a heretofore sleepy and uneventful Florida swamp hamlet . Useless backwater sheriff Buster Crabbe ( who looks amazingly trim and fit in his unfortunate final filmic fling ) basically just takes up space and acts dumber than a tree stump . It's up to both snoopy newspaper reporter Ray Roberts and earnest game warden Mike Bonavia to save the day . Spectacularly shoddy and ramshackle , this agonizingly abysmal clinker represents an ungodly apotheosis of incredibly pitiful cinematic crumminess . We've got fumbling , clueless direction from the always dependably dreadful Mr . Ray ( who also cameos as a doomed hick hunter ) . Then there's a sorry cast of washed-up has-beens and understandably obscure never-wheres who couldn't act their way out of a moldy wet paper bag . The choppy editing , lousy cinematography ( the frequent excruciatingly slow fade-outs are especially crude while the strenuously drawn out slow-motion zombie attack is downright sad to behold ) , poor , scratchy , badly synced sound , lame , phony minimalistic make-up f / x , and comparably dismal ( extremely less than ) special f / x ( the crashing meteorite resembles a large orange flair ) are uniformly pathetic . Several cornball , intensely unlistenable country-and-western songs whine away on the soundtrack and a watery , off-key , annoyingly droning score likewise inflicts a massive headache on the luckless viewer . The really horrible campy dialogue , equally terrible and faltering attempts at deliberately dumb humor , and a wholly insufferable bunch of obnoxiously stupid redneck characters further diminish any entertainment value this turkey might have possessed . Keep your eyes peeled for an astonishingly obvious continuity gaffe involving a three-pronged pitchfork which magically sprouts an extra fourth prong after an old lady zombie gets impaled on it . Of course , there's plentiful , but weak gore ( a dog snacks on a bisected corpse , zoms graphically nosh on limbs and entrails , victims spit up mouthfuls of blood as they're being snacked on , that sort of lame , humdrum nonsense ) and even a little sprinkling of gratuitous female nudity courtesy of a skinny-dipping chick who gets assaulted by a zombie while swimming topless in a lake . In short , Fred Olen Ray's singularly screwy , cheerfully slipshod , and blatantly cruddy film-making anti-style is richly apparent in this early masterwork . In fact , if hideously maladroit cinematic offal was indeed a kind of warped , deviant and degenerate quasi-art form , then this smokin ' stinkeroonie would be its proudly putrid platonic essence .
518059	8239592	437353	1.0	Horrendous junk	If you ever wanted to see a gratingly overwrought Howard Stern all jacked up on speed horribly overplay a demented , cross-dressing , masturbating , mother-hating , whore-slaughtering , high decibel profanity-spewing , corpse-fornicating ( " I love beepin ' ' em when they're dead " ) , smack-shooting , brain-eating , gay-bashing , spastic fit-throwing , hallucinating , totally whacked out of his mind with a toxically murderous mixture of misogynistic rage and psychopathic fury racist lunatic serial killer who went around the bloodthirsty bend because his nasty abusive slut of a mommy liked to shove a beer bottle up his butt as a little boy and now gleefully butchers folks as a crazed nutjob adult when he isn't running around stark naked screaming unprintable vile epithets at the top of his lungs in a hideously redundant , tiresomely strident , completely uninsightful and so aggressively base that it's merely annoying instead of remotely amusing or offensive downright lousy gore opus , then this fetid , obnoxious , sex , rape , nudity and violence-laden worthless chunk of dreadfully puerile splatter porn schlock is just the movie for you . Me ? I'd rather rewatch the outstanding " Henry : Portrait of A Serial Killer " again than sit through this godawful interminable bilge a second time .
518526	8239592	78113	2.0	A really lame'n'tame Indonesian clone of your standard Italian cannibal jungle adventure romp	Rugged Robert ( hunky Barry Prima ) , snippy Rita ( homely eyesore Enny Haryono ) , and nerdy Tommy ( bespectacled beanpole dweeb Johann Mardjono ) are a trio of eager young college students who along with their macho guide Bisma ( chunky bearded wonder Rukman Herman ) find themselves in deep trouble when they encounter a lethal tribe of primitive cannibals deep in the jungle . Man , does this extremely cheap and crummy clunker strike out something rotten in every conceivable department : Sisworo Guatama Putra's flat , fumbling ( mis ) direction , the poky pace , Imam Tantowi's by-the-numbers hackneyed and predictable cookie cutter script , the slipshod editing , the bland acting , Lee Fioole's sub-par cinematography , the dreadful dubbing , precious little nudity , several poorly staged action scenes ( in one especially unimpressive scene a native feebly wrestles with a python ) , the mild gore , Gatot Sudarto's mostly insipid , only sporadically lively score , a pitifully dumb and nonexplicit attempted rape that's followed by an equally lousy off-screen castration , and the colorless , unappealing main characters ( Rita in particular is insufferably whiny ) all leave a great deal to be desired . The fact that the DVD source print is clearly taken a beat-up VHS tape complete with drop-outs and occasional faulty tracking doesn't help matters in the least . This stinker quite simply lacks the essential sleaze and vigor that it needs in order to qualify as an entertaining piece of trash . Only the beautiful jungle scenery and the inspired use of Kraftwork's insanely funky " We Are the Robots " as the opening credits theme song offer some relief from the overall stupefying tedium . A dismally dull and dissatisfying dud .
519103	8239592	47507	2.0	The first and worst of the 50's yeti horror films	This rock-bottom ' 54 cheapie clinker is the first and worst fright feature made in the 50's about the legendary Abominable Snowman . This paltry carbon copy of " King Kong " ( natch ) , " The Werewolf of London , " and even the exemplary giant ant humdinger " Them ! " constitutes as a most unfortunate and inauspicious cinematic debut for the yeti . A stuffed-shirt botanist , his comparably blah assistant , and a bunch of anonymous oriental extras embark on a perilous pilgrimage into the Himalayas to discover a rare plant species . The expedition stumbles across a predatory yeti ( a very tall , gangly guy in a threadbare poorly stitched together mangy fur costume ) who in tried'n'true B-movie monster fashion makes off with the first available female he can get his grubby paws on . The team members manage to get the fair damsel back and capture the humanoid beast . They bring it to Los Angeles , only to have the ratty hairball escape and seek refuge in the City of Angel's grimy sewers . An air of total creative and budgetary impoverishment permeates every aspect of this sour lemon . There's lackluster direction by Billy Wilder's no-talent brother W . Lyle Wilder , lethargic pacing , primitive fade-outs , dry acting from a just - hitting - all - the - usual - preprogrammed - marks robotic cast , tedious running-off-at-the-mouth verbose narration ( " The first few days were uneventful , monotonous and routine , " the botanist comments early in the nonaction , a remark which serves as an apt concise critique of the film itself ) , a few stomach-knotting moments of goopy sentiment , and a pitifully unimpressive star monster . But what really deflates this celluloid lead balloon is its complete lack of any trashy vitality - - this excruciatingly sorry and static yeti stinker is so inert and lifeless that it just lies motionless on your TV screen for 71 painfully draggy and dreary minutes of sheer unbearable boredom .
519134	8239592	28174	3.0	A real snorefest	Wimpy stuffed shirt Armand Louque ( blandly played by veteran character actor Dean Jagger in a rare lead role ) joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies . Armand falls for the lovely Claire Duval ( fetching blonde Dorothy Stone ) , who uses the meek sap to get Armand's colleague Clifford Grayson ( the hopelessly wooden Robert Noland ) to marry her . Furious over being used and spurned by Claire , Armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to get revenge . Sound exciting ? Well , it sure ain't . For starters , Victor Halperin's static ( non ) direction lets the meandering and uneventful talk-ridden story plod along at an excruciatingly slow pace . Worse yet , Halperin crucially fails to bring any tension , atmosphere and momentum to the hideously tedious proceedings . The mostly blah acting from a largely insipid cast doesn't help matters any ; only George Cleveland as the hearty General Duval and E . Alyn Warren as the irascible Dr . Trevissant manage to enliven things a bit with their welcome and refreshing hammy histrionics . The drippy stock film library score , the painfully obvious stagebound sets , and the crude cinematography are pretty lousy and unimpressive as well . In fact , this feeble excuse for a fright feature is so crummy that not even the uncredited starkly staring eyes of the great Bela Lugosi can alleviate the brain-numbing boredom . A dismally dull dud .
518056	8239592	78159	8.0	A charming and enjoyable Bigfoot children's movie	This charmingly pleasant and tenderhearted sequel to the hugely successful " The Legend of Boggy Creek " is a follow-up in name only . Stories abound in a sleepy , self-contained fishing community of a supposedly vicious Bigfoot creature called " Big Bay Ty " that resides deep in the uninviting swamplands of Boggy Creek . Two bratty brothers and their older , more sensible tomboy sister ( a sweetly feisty performance by cute , pigtailed future " Different Strokes " sitcom star Dana Plato ) go venturing into the treacherous marsh to check out if the creature of local legend may be in fact a real live being . The trio get hopelessly lost in a fierce storm and the furry , bear-like , humongous , but very gentle and benevolent Sasquatch comes to the kids ' rescue . Tom Moore's casual , no-frills direction relates this simple story at a leisurely pace , astutely capturing the workaday minutiae of the rural town in compellingly exact detail , drawing the assorted country characters with great warmth and affection , and thankfully developing the sentiment in an organic , restrained , unforced manner that never degenerates into sticky-sappy mush . The adorable Dawn Wells ( Mary Ann on " Gilligan's Island " ) gives an engagingly plucky portrayal of the kids ' loving working class single mom while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer enjoyably irascible support as a couple of squabbling ol ' hayseed curmudgeonly coots . Robert Bethard's capable , sunny cinematography displays the woodsy setting in all its sumptuously tranquil , achingly pure and fragile untouched by civilization splendor . Darrell Deck's score adeptly blends flesh-crawling synthesizer shudders and jubilant banjo-pluckin ' country bluegrass into a tuneful sonic brew . In addition , this picture warrants special praise for the way it uncannily predicts the 90's kiddie feature Bigfoot vogue by a good 15-odd years in advance .
518555	8239592	105169	8.0	An excellent , involving and unfairly overlooked early 90's female psycho thriller sleeper	Female psycho movies - - " The Witch Who Came from the Sea , " " Silent Scream , " " The Babysitter , " et al . - - tend to possess an uncommon and therefor refreshing sensitivity , going out of their way to depict their troubled , murderous protagonists as people who were cruelly victimized early in life and hence themselves have become spiteful , vengeful victimizers . This eerie , unfairly overlooked sleeper , one of the few distaff serial killer entries in the largely male dominated 90's psycho movie genre , rates highly as a sterling addition to this unusual and intriguing cycle . Daphne Zuniga , who began her film career with appearances in the college-set 80's slasher items " The Dorm That Dripped Blood " and " The Intitiation , " delivers a striking , fantastic , scarily believable performance as an extremely pliant and puzzled , but still quite cunning and dangerous asylum escapee who assumes the personality of everyone she kills . James Wilder is solid and engaging as the feckless , irresponsible , swaggering cowboy loner who becomes Zuniga's latest victim . Willful , no-nonsense small country town deputy Alexandra Paul ( who's also Wilder's understandably bitter former girlfriend and jilted would-be wife ) and helpful nice guy FBI agent Don Harvey track Zuniga down , desperately trying to catch her before she racks up a hefty corpse tally . Fleming B . Fuller's direction completely hits the bull's eye : a goodly amount of tension is deftly created and maintained , the steady pace never slackens , the characters are credibly drawn ( the strained , regretful relationship between Wilder and Paul rings especially true ) , the lean , strong and compelling narrative doesn't overstay its welcome , the acting is uniformly top-notch ( Harvey , who's usually cast as hateful sadistic villains , does a rare pleasant and appealing turn in an atypical decent dude part ) , the bleak , parched desert locations are nicely taken advantage of , and the occasional outbursts of violence are properly brutal and genuinely startling ( the opening sequence in which Zuniga throttles a nurse with a wire coat hanger is particularly jolting ) . Zuniga's amazing , complicated , even pitiable and unexpectedly moving portrayal of the emotionally unstable and mercurial killer clinches the whole deal : she's alternately demure and sexy , fearsome and lethal , vulnerable and impenetrable , lucid and confused , a dizzying array of contrasting moods which makes her character in equal degrees frightfully unpredictable and wholly fascinating . More importantly , like the classic truly memorable and oddly affecting horror movie monsters of yore , Zuniga at heart is almost as much of a victim as the people she preys on , a tragic person who has to take on other people's identities because she can't live with the shame and the guilt she feels as herself after having killed her own abusive mother at a young , tender age . This latter element adds a stunningly effective dash of deeply poignant pathos which elevates this chillingly dead-on picture to the status of a surefire winner .
517905	8239592	66154	8.0	A very brutal , chilling & potent end-of-the-world film	Cornel Wilde , widely regarded as one of the truest and purest of cinematic primitives due to his blunt , sinewy , straightforward and nonjudgmental presentation of " civilized " man and his disturbingly easy capacity for violence given the correct stimulus , here depicts a very chilling vision of societal collapse in this ecology-minded sci-fi end-of-the-world movie . Mankind's gross polluting of the environment begets a lethal virus which kills off the earth's crops , resulting in famine , mass panic and hysteria , rioting in the streets , and the violent breakdown of society itself . Rugged , resilient and resourceful former military man survivalist Nigel Davenport , his equally strong and durable wife Jean Wallace ( Wilde's real life spouse and frequent lead in his pictures ) , Davenport's fragile , virginal daughter ( " Vampire Circus " ' s adorable Lynn Frederick ) and son , the daughter's nice guy fiancé , a loutish brute and the brute's slutty wife leave London and make a perilous pilgrimage across the desolate , dangerous countryside . Many wayward travelers join the group and form a ragtag army which fends off a savage gang of murderous rapist bikers . Wilde relates this grim premise with his usual stark , spare and no-frills muscular style ( although the occasionally clumsy use of flash-forwards badly dates this film ) , keeping sentiment to a bare minimum , tautly maintaining a properly bleak tone , offering up an upsetting array of jarring visuals ( i . e . , a dry , barren landscape littered with animal corpses ) , and refusing to resort to cheap moralizing , but still clearly spelling out the harsh , albeit absolute necessity for killing in order to remain alive and persevere in a barbarous world . A bit crude and rough around the edges , but overall an extremely powerful and unsettling film .
518547	8239592	78295	8.0	A gripping and suspenseful made-for-TV thriller	Sassy TV director Leigh Michaels ( an engagingly spunky and spirited performance by the lovely Lauren Hutton ) arrives in Los Angeles and moves into a swanky high-rise apartment . Some peeping tom creep starts stalking her from afar , taunting her with crank phone calls and sinister letters in the mail . But Leigh refuses to play victim and becomes determined to uncover the nut's true identity . Writer / director John Carpenter ably builds plenty of tension , maintains a brisk pace throughout , and stages one doozy of a harrowing climax . Moreover , there's a pertinent and provocative central message about how advances in technology make it easier for someone to invade another person's privacy . Hutton positively shines in the lead ; she gets fine support from David Birney as affable college professor Paul Winkless , Adrienne Barbeau as friendly lesbian coworker Sophie , Carpenter movie regular Charles Cyphers as unhelpful police detective Paul Hunt , Grainger Hines as smarmy technician Steve , and Len Lesser as a menacing burly man . Rober Hauser's sharp , polished cinematography and Harry Sukman's classy , rousing , shivery score are both up to par . Well worth a look .
518726	8239592	74080	8.0	An above average 70's hick revenge picture starring the ever-beauteous Claudia Jennings	The irrepressible Claudia Jennings is her usual affable , fiery , smolderingly sensual self as Desiree , a spunky Cajun alligator poacher who's falsely accused of murder by a cretinous clan of vile sexist hillbilly male scuzzbuckets . Worse yet , these detestable rednecks rape and kill Desiree's little sister as well . Naturally , Desiree fights back , using her raw cunning and feminine wiles to exact a harsh revenge on her hateful tormentors . Claudia's perky , pulchritudinous presence always enlivened any given 70's drive-in exploitation feature she appeared in , which is definitely the case here . However , Claudia ain't the whole show : the formidable Bill Thurman plays a corrupt , treacherous sheriff with his usual enthralling solemnity , Janet ( " Ruby , " " Humongous " ) Baldwin is cute and endearing as Claudia's adorable younger sister , Sam Gilman hams it up deliciously as the nasty father of the no-account hayseed family , the marshy bayou backwoods setting is vividly rendered , and the mush-mouthed Lee Darwin energetically belts out a bunch of dippy , banjo-plucking country and western songs on the oddly infectious soundtrack . Cheap , dumb and tawdry , but done with a certain breezy'n'cheesy élan , " ' Gatorbait " rates as perfectly enjoyable low-budget down-home trash .
518085	8239592	171444	8.0	A prime piece of rousing Sonny Chiba martial arts trash	A tough rogue mercenary ( the almighty Sonny Chiba ) arrives in a town where two rival gangs are engaged in a harsh turf war over who's got exclusive dibs on an expensive stash of heroin . Chiba pits both gangs against each other for his own personal gain . Director Kazuhiko Yamaguchi maintains a fast , unflagging pace throughout , stages the copious fight scenes with excitingly bloody'n'brutal gusto , and even sprinkles a generous amount of gratuitous female nudity . The snazzy cinematography makes inspired use of split screen , freeze frames , and strikingly stylized strenuous slow motion . Moreover , the use of a shaky hand-held camera during the savage fight scenes adds an extra thrilling raw energy to the already lively proceedings . The groovy fuzztone guitar-burning score likewise hits the funky spot . With his hard-boiled charisma and surly screen presence , Chiba makes for a perfect blithely amoral and cynical anti-hero . He gets to show a more soft and sensitive side when his character befriends a little boy ; this surprisingly touching subplot has an especially sweet and moving payoff . Of course , Chiba truly shines with his ever vicious and unbridled displays of poke-your-eyes-out nasty and ferocious martial arts . A solid and satisfying chopsocky outing that's well worth checking out .
518883	8239592	105242	8.0	A strong , absorbing and effectively creepy horror winner	Classy , worried Claire Ward ( the lovely Jane Sibbett ) hires smooth private detective John March ( the likable John Terry ) to find out what her secretive , obsessive husband Charles Dexter Ward ( a typically fine , intense and gripping portrayal by the always reliable Chris Sarandon ) has been doing in a remote woodland farmhouse he's secluded himself in . The pair discover much to their horror and dismay that Ward has found the key to immortality , which naturally comes at a truly terrible price . Director Dan ( " The Return of the Living Dead " ) O'Bannon , working from an intricate and intelligent script by Brent V . Friedman ( said script is based on a H . P . Lovecraft short story ) , deftly creates and sustains an arrestingly eerie and mysterious mood , keeps the pace plugging along at a steady clip , and coaxes solid performances from a sturdy cast ( Robert Romanus in particular is very engaging as March's wiseguy partner Lonnie ) . Moreover , Irv Goodnoff's glossy , graceful cinematography , Richard ( " Re-Animator " ) Band's soaring , supremely spooky score , and Todd Masters ' wonderfully grotesque creature f / x are all up to par as well . The film reaches its marvelously clammy , creepy and claustrophobic nerve-wracking zenith when March , Claire and Lonnie venture into the farmhouse basement and encounter the ghastly mistakes of Ward's previous failed experiments . Best of all , the grimly serious tone , judicious use of gore and monster effects , and gradual build-up towards a startling climax ensure that this feature works remarkably well as one hell of a fiercely unsettling scarefest . An excellent and unjustly overlooked sleeper .
518201	8239592	478188	8.0	A fun fantasy adventure flick	A commercial airliner crashes in a remote Amazon jungle . The motley group of survivors find themselves in a strange and dangerous world populated by big deadly spiders , giant scorpions , winged reptiles , killer sentient vines , a lethal native tribe , and a fearsome towering ape . Director / co-writer Leigh Scott relates the absorbing premise at a steady , snappy pace , maintains an admirably serious tone throughout , and stages the thrilling action scenes with a reasonable amount of flair . Moreover , the sturdy cast all deliver solid and spirited performances : Bruce Boxleitner as the huffy , enigmatic Lt . Challenger , Rhett Giles as the stalwart , resourceful John Roxton , Jeff Denton as the likable , sensible Ed Malone , Sarah Lieving as plucky photographer Rita Summerlee , Christina Rosenberg as fidgety , foxy California babe Dana , Chriss Anglin as nasty native tribe leader Olo , Amanda Ward as pretty stewardess Natalie , Boni Yamagisawa as feisty native girl Tianka , and Thomas Downey as the jerky Reggie . Steve Railsback contributes an especially lively turn as the deranged Larry . Steve Parker's crisp cinematography and Ralph Rieckermann's robust , rousing score are both up to speed . Plus there's a decent smidgen of gore , a dab of tasty female nudity , and a welcome absence of both pretense and cheesy oneliners . Granted , the CGI creatures are really tacky and unconvincing , but that criticism aside this flick overall sizes up as one hell of an enjoyable romp .
519058	8239592	493231	8.0	A hilariously horrendous low-budget action hoot	A bunch of nasty thugs who work for vicious crime kingpin Hawthorne ( a deliciously hammy portrayal by Tom Story ) kill both the father and fiancé of ace martial artist Alex Hunter ( a hopelessly wooden performance by real-life kickboxing champion Curtis Bush ) . The thugs severely beat Alex up , but don't finish him off . Big mistake . After being nursed back to health and extensively trained in the fine art of down'n'dirty streetfighting by tough , yet friendly crippled black Vietnam veteran Joshua ( amiable Rod Suiter ) , Alex decks himself out in black ninja garb , assumes the gnarly name the Dark Angel , and declares open season on no-count criminal scum who terrorize the streets of the city . Naturally , everything eventually culminates in the inevitable showdown between Alex and Hawthorne and his army of mean flunkies . Man , does this often uproariously atrocious honey possess all the right wrong stuff to qualify as a real four-star stinkeroonie : we've got totally all-thumbs ( mis ) direction by Mardy Smith , laughably lousy acting by a game , but lame no-name cast , tin-eared dialogue , a funky , syncopated synthesizer score by Danny Dennison , a by-the-numbers hackneyed and predictable script by Kathy Varner , clunky action set pieces , a gut-busting godawful ending credits theme song , and an " it ain't over yet " sequel set-up conclusion ( alas , said sequel has so far not been made ) . Moreover , this flick offers an inspired sense of the absurd . For example , every back alley , parking lot and street corner in the city just happens to have nefarious hoodlums on it . Plus Alex magically pops up out of nowhere to save the day time and time again . Bonus points are in order for Kim Reynolds as feisty meddlesome tabloid newspaper reporter Cassie : Although the lovely lass probably couldn't act her way out of a soggy cardboard box , Miss Reynolds still gets my respect because she apparently never bothers to wear underwear and takes a wholly gratuitous , but still much-appreciated bath so male viewers can drool over her luscious naked body . In addition , this movie really pours on the marvelously excessive brutal and gory over-the-top violence : throats are sliced open , heads are blown up , hands are cut off , and , in the undeniable sidesplitting splatter highlight , an irate female motorist runs over the head of a would-be carjacker . While by no means a genuinely good picture , this baby nonetheless does possess a certain clumsy sincerity which in turn greatly enhances its considerable campy charm . A complete cruddy riot .
519072	8239592	493260	8.0	A touching documentary about the more human side of Sam Peckinpah	Legendary tough guy director Sam Peckinpah's sister Fern Lea Peter reminisces about growing up with Sam . She talks about an incident when Sam fell off a horse and broke his back , how in the Peckinpah family you hunted always for food instead of sport , how her father was a judge and died at a fairly young age ( had her father lived Fern claims Sam would have turned out differently ) , a split between her and Sam that was later fixed when they both attended a Golden Boot Awards Show for him ( Peckinpah sadly died a few months after the show ) , how Sam got his artistic side from his mother , and how in his hometown Sam is not as revered as he should be . In addition , Fern points out how her father was a major influence on the Joel McCrea character in Sam's terrific Western gem " Ride the High Country . " This lovely and moving documentary gives the viewer some invaluable insight into how Sam's childhood days played a key role in shaping him into the troubled man and insanely brilliant artist that he grew up to become . This poignant documentary is absolutely essential viewing for Sam Peckinpah fans .
519073	8239592	260492	8.0	A compellingly stark and sordid depiction of the 60's New York gay bath house scene	Awkward young gay man Thomas ( an engagingly gawky performance by Gerard Jacuzzo ) goes to a bath house and encounters a diverse array of homosexual guys . Thomas strikes up a rapport with the friendly , but frustrated and unhappily married Mr . Jaffee ( superbly played with riveting gravitas by Robert Dahdah ) . Andy Milligan , working from a sharp , bold , incisive script by Hope Stansbury , does an expert job of creating and sustaining an arrestingly gritty and seedy atmosphere while delivering a rough-around-the-edges , yet touching and compassionate cinematic meditation on loneliness and the basic human need for direct emotional contact . This movie boasts several poignant and powerful moments , with Mr . Jaffee's sad monologue about the tragic untimely drowning death of his son rating as a positively gut-wrenching highlight . The first-rate naturalistic acting from a uniformly tip-top cast qualifies as another significant asset : Jacuzzo and Dahdah are outstanding in the leads , with fine support from Hal Borske as the bitter , spiteful Mavis , Hal Sherwood as the effeminate Miss Parrish , Richard Goldberger as the catty Thumbelina , and Ron Keith as an aggressive seducer . Milligan's raw and grainy 16mm black and white hand-held cinematography further adds to the jolting impact and immediacy of this intriguing short feature . Proof positive that Andy Milligan could make a genuinely good picture when given the right material to work with .
518145	8239592	70393	8.0	A splendidly hard-edged Italian crime thriller knockout	After his beloved mentor and superior gets killed , rough'n'tumble loose cannon police lieutenant Giorgio Caneparo ( well played by the handsome and charismatic Luc Merenda ) goes undercover as a vicious criminal in order to infiltrate the bank robbing gang responsible for the hit . Director Sergio Martino , working from a tough , complex script by Ernesto Gastaldi and taking a break from his usual giallo murder mystery thrillers , takes a welcome stab at the Italian crime thriller genre and comes up with an impressively tight , gripping and hard-hitting winner : the constant quick pace rarely flags , the tone is appropriately harsh and no-nonsense ( several innocent bystanders get killed which include a little girl and a pregnant woman ! ) , there are occasional startling outbursts of brutal'n'bloody violence , the intricate narrative offers plenty of neat twists and turns , and the action set pieces ate deftly staged with rip-roaring élan ( a couple of protracted car chases are especially exciting ) . This film further benefits from excellent acting by a tip-top cast : Merenda makes for a perfectly rugged and amoral anti-hero , Richard Conte lends able support as smooth capo Padulo , and the lovely Martine Brochard acquits herself nicely as brassy junkie prostitute Maria . Kudos are also in order for Giancarlo Ferrando's fluid , polished cinematography , the moody , groovy score by Guido and Maurizio De Angelis , and the bitterly cynical bummer ending which concludes everything on a satisfyingly downbeat note . Highly recommended viewing for Italian crime cinema fans .
519279	8239592	69914	8.0	Four is fine , but five's a crowd !	Composed , elegant Carol ( marvelously played by the beautiful Rebecca Brooke ) , her nice husband Eddie ( likable David Houseman ) , Carol's wacky , constantly eating best gal pal Anna ( delightfully essayed with infectious comic zeal by the adorable Chris Jordan ) , and Anna's hunky , amorous husband Pete ( a typically fine Eric Edwards ) are a quartet of liberated swingers who enjoy having frequent group sex with each other . Their usual routine gets disrupted when Carol's lonely , repressed , but still alluring widow mother Jennifer ( a superbly moving performance by the lovely Jennifer Welles ) drops by for a visit . Pretty soon Jennifer loosens up and becomes a willing participant in the swingers ' blithely pleasurable and uninhibited carnal lifestyle , with everyone except Carol eager to seduce her . Writer / director Joe Sarno concocts a sharp , engrossing and perceptive examination of suburban angst and the limitations of the whole wild'n'easy 70's sexual revolution ; Sarno turns traditional middle class mores on their heads and further spices things up with a bold and provocative mother / daughter incest subplot . Moreover , Sarno elicits uniformly first-rate acting from the bang-up cast : Welles and Brooke are both exceptional , with excellent support from Edwards , Jordan , Houseman , Arlana Blue as flaky New Age sex therapist Shandara , and Erica Eaton as saucy neighbor Mrs . Fields . Better still , all the women are extremely hot and enticing ; Welles in particular seriously steams up the screen with her exquisitely voluptuous figure and smoldering erotic presence . The sex scenes are really sizzling and fairly explicit , but never raunchy or tedious . Stephen Colwell's bright , polished cinematography and Jack Justis ' bouncy , melodic acoustic folk score are both on the money solid and effective . Recommended viewing for Sarno fans .
518069	8239592	83133	8.0	A gut-busting spoof of early 80's slasher flicks	A depraved killer known as the Breather ( voiced with hysterically lecherous aplomb by stand-up comedian Richard Belzer ) bumps off the libidinous students of Lamab High School in assorted highly imaginative ways ( the psycho's unlikely and inventive implements of death include paper clips , an eggplant , and even an eraser ! ) . Writer / director Mickey Rose offers broad parodies of such popular fright fare as " Halloween , " " Friday the 13th , " " When a Stranger Calls , " " Carrie , " and " Prom Night ; " the humor found herein is crude , raunchy , unsubtle , tasteless , offensive , inspired ( I loved the on-screen tally which keeps track of the ever-mounting corpse count ) , and hence flat-out hilarious . This is the type of no-holds-barred open season on everyone and everything raucous humor that was prevalent in the pre-politically correct 80's and that's exactly why this picture is often so incredibly funny . For example , there's a black foreign exchange student who nobody misses after he gets killed . Plus there are jokes about handicapped people as well . However , the tone is thankfully silly and amiable enough to prevent this film from seeming nasty and mean-spirited . The lively and enthusiastic acting from a game no-name cast rates as another significant plus : Kristen Riter makes for a most charming and fetching virginal innocent heroine , Joe Flood is an absolute hoot as deranged workshop teacher Mr . Dumpkin , and spindly comedian the Stick steals the whole show as dim-witted double-jointed janitor Malvert . A total riot . And remember folks , sex kills .
518901	8239592	118075	8.0	Another worthy entry in this delightful series	Blithely naughty virtual reality hooker Heidi Ho ( deliciously essayed to campy'n'vampy perfection by buxom blonde babe J . J . North ) gets unleashed from a computer by the commissioner's geeky son Irwin ( a nice'n'nerdy turn by Chad Gabbert ) and goes on a libidinous rampage . It's up to scatterbrained ditz Candy ( the adorably daffy Elizabeth Kaitan ) and her snarky new partner Traci ( sassy brunette spitfire Raelyn Saalman ) to stop Heidi Ho . Meanwhile , starchy repressed spinster supreme Miss Devonshire ( the terrific Jayne Hamil ) tries to salvage her floundering marriage with the cocky , yet clueless commissioner ( Jay Richardson in fine pompous form ) . Once again writer / director Rick Sloane hits the crudely amusing bull's eye with plenty of spot-on lowbrow japes about such certifiably gut-busting subjects as undercover lady cops being beaten up by prostitutes , sexual harassment , catfights , bad practical jokes , and nasty sexually transmitted computer virus diseases . This flick further benefits from spirited acting by a sturdy cast : Kaitan and Saalman make for a suitably sexy mismatched team , Tane McClure has a neat supporting role as bitchy , meddlesome councilwoman Jean Capri , Michael Kayem is a total hoot as stuck-up sexist pig stud muffin patrolman Petrolino , and Honey Lauren adds a little extra sauciness as brash sex therapist Dr . Tiffany Berkowitz . Stephen Crawford's cinematography is merely adequate while both the insanely crankin ' theme song " Pistol Whipped " and Alan DerMarderisian's funky score do the gnarly trick . Plus this picture doesn't skimp on the yummy distaff eye candy : North , Saalman and Kaitan all have much-appreciated topless scenes . Essential viewing for fans of this always enjoyable series .
519178	8239592	69979	8.0	An immensely enjoyable Italian male buddy Mafia crime opus	Steely , powerful gangster supreme Frankie Diomede ( the always terrific Lee Van Cleef in fine rugged form ) has himself arrested and sent to prison so he can rub out a traitorous partner sans detection . Fawning goofball small-time hood and wiseguy wannabe Tony Breda ( an amiable portrayal by Tony Lo Bianco ) gets busted as well . Frank and Tony form an unlikely friendship behind bars . Tony helps Frank break out of the joint and assists him on his quest to exact revenge on a rival group of mobsters lead by the ruthless Louis Annunziata ( smoothly played by Jean Rochefort ) . Director Michele Lupo , working from an absorbing script by Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni , relates the neat story at a constant brisk pace , sustains a suitably gritty , but occasionally lighthearted tone throughout , and stages the rousing action set pieces with considerable rip-snorting brio ( a rough'n'tumble jailhouse shower brawl and a protracted mondo destructo car chase rate as the definite thrilling highlights ) . Van Cleef and Lo Bianco display a nice , loose and engaging on-screen chemistry ; the relationship between their characters is alternately funny and touching . The ravishing Edwige Fenech alas isn't given much to do as Tony's whiny girlfriend Orchidea , but at least gets to bare her insanely gorgeous and voluptuous body in a much-appreciated gratuitous nude shower scene . Riz Ortolani's groovy , pulsating , syncopated funk / jazz score certainly hits the soulfully swingin ' spot . The polished cinematography by Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti is likewise impressive . A really nifty and entertaining little winner .
518711	8239592	65692	8.0	A strikingly original and compelling experimental oddity	In the late 60's up until the late 70's Stacy Keach appeared with pleasing regularity in a sizable volume of seriously offbeat try-and-do-whatever defiantly unconventional and noncommercial oddball indie movies . These pictures include John Huston's beautifully downbeat " Fat City , " the gloomy dope addict feature " Watched , " the wonderfully outré " The Ninth Configuration , " Jack Starrett's delightfully giddy'n'quirky crime romp " The Dion Brothers , " and this truly idiosyncratic cinematic marvel of deeply depressed late 60's anarchy , disillusionment and spiritual malaise , which is arguably the strangest of the whole kooky bunch . Keach delivers a typically all-out loopy performance that's all fried nerves , eroding mental stability and spaced-out behavior as Jack Horner , a recent dejected college graduate who seeks psychological help from wacko unorthodox maverick shrink Doctor D ( an extraordinarily nutty turn by a bearded , slender James Earl Jones ) . Doctor D encourages Jack to " do his own thing , " a treatment which prompts Jack to get a job at a college as an English professor . Pretty soon Jack is having an adulteress fling with the neglected unhappy wife ( superbly played by Dorothy Tristan ) of a crazed , pompous colleague ( marvelously essayed to smug , callous perfection by Harris Yulin in his film debut ) , a precarious situation which begets tragic consequences for all concerned . Addressing such pertinent topics as loss of identity , commonplace violence in contemporary society , abortion , drug use , infidelity , insanity and the sheer lunacy and bleak emptiness of middle class American existence with a bracing and fiercely pointed sense of sardonic humor , this grim social satire that was co-written by Terry Southern and garishly shot by Gordon Willis never lets up on its nihilistic , everything's-going-to-hell acid-soaked tone , thus making for a properly harsh , often funny and frequently provocative ridicule of trippy uninhibited 60's excess and messed-upness .
518015	8239592	435653	8.0	A pleasingly spooky and unsettling supernatural horror chiller	Three old college friends - - mature Harris ( Dominic Purcell ) , happy-go-lucky Sid ( Marcus Thomas ) and sultry Kira ( the lovely Josie Maran ) - - are reunited at the funeral of a fellow college chum . After the funeral they all sneak into a cemetery at night , get drunk , read a sinister incantation poem , and dance on several graves . The trio unwittingly resurrect the deadly spirits of a lethal axe murderess , a deranged child pyromaniac and a vicious , depraved rapist who proceed to haunt them for an entire month . If the ghosts aren't laid back to rest right away , they will grow increasingly stronger and more dangerous as the month progresses . Director Mike Mendez gradually develops a truly creepy and unnerving atmosphere with great skill and conviction prior to pulling out all the stirring stops in the rousing and hair-raising final third . The three leads all give fine and appealing performances ; they receive bang-up support from Clare Kramer as Harris ' sweet wife Allison , Tcheky Karyo as eccentric paranormal investigator Vincent and Megahn Perry as Vincent's cute spunky assistant Culpepper . The cadaverous skull-faced ghouls are genuinely freaky and frightening . David A . Armstrong's smooth , gloomy cinematography , the admirably serious and sincere tone , Joseph Bishara's eerie score , the well-drawn and engaging main characters , and the excellent special effects further enhance the overall sound quality of this very solid and satisfying supernatural horror shocker .
518311	8239592	100705	8.0	A really fun and enjoyable low-budget futuristic sci-fi hoot	In the bleak near future Los Angeles has become a dangerous war zone with cops pitted against assorted law-breaking lowlifes . Sergeant Arliss Ryder ( well played with customary wired intensity by the always great Wings Hauser ) has an electronic device put into his back that turns him into an out-of-control psychotic killer and put on the Strike S . Q . U . A . D . ( an acronym for Scum Quelling Assault Urban Devision ) , which is a unit of crazed cops assigned by Captain Bill Quinton ( a typically gruff Alex Cord ) to rid the City of Angels of criminals by using any means necessary . The only problem is that Arliss discovers what's going down and decides to put a stop to all this madness . Director Gregory Dark's second futuristic sci-fi / action outing is a considerable improvement over the flawed , but still pretty decent " Dead Man Walking " : the action is more plentiful and nicely staged , the plot's much tighter and more thrilling , the pace moves at a snappier rate , and the budget appears to be a little bigger . This picture further benefits from amusing supporting performances by notorious Watergate crook G . Gordon Liddy as mayor candidate Jim Miller , an absolute deranged lunatic who gets his sick kicks by having prostitutes whip him while wearing leather dominatrix outfits ( ! ) ; Sy Richardson as unhinged homosexual policeman Joker , and an especially hilarious Brion James as demented fire'n'brimstone street preacher J . J . Mony , who in the film's definite sidesplitting wacko highlight douses a slimy pimp with gasoline and sets the man ablaze . A cool and unjustly overlooked end-of-the-world science fiction sleeper .
518053	8239592	100528	8.0	A hugely enjoyable monster-on-the-loose horror romp	One part end-of-the-world thriller , two parts werewolf-like nocturnal beast on the rampage horror picture , and all parts quick-moving , animated , get right down to business butt-stomping fun , this hugely enjoyable romp makes for a most pleasant surprise . An ancient rhunestone that's the prison for a centuries old clawed , fanged , highly lethal lupine humanoid monster gets unearthed in a Pennsylvannia coal mine . When the gigantic rock is sent to New York City so it can be displayed in an art gallery , naturally our hairy , hulking , none too friendly or sociable whatchamathingie wakes up from its lengthy slumber and boy is he one grumpy SOB ! Pretty soon it's racking up a hefty corpse tally as a gruesome preliminary to a possible apocalypse said beast is a harbinger of . Of course , your usual colorfully mixed bag of courageous protagonists - - skeptical artist Joan Severance , her hunky boyfriend Tim Ryan , plucky teen Chris Young , and eccentric clockmaker Alexander Godunov - - have to stop this vicious critter or it's curtains for us all , baby ! Besides the inspired and imaginative handy dandy multi-genre combo narrative which scores bonus novelty points for making Armageddon part of a Nordic prophecy rather than the standard hackneyed Christian religious hooey , this surprisingly well-produced and energetically executed little number further benefits from William Carroll's brisk , capable direction , a steady , unflagging forward-ho pace , David Newman's rousing score , some nice witty touches , a cool monster , handsome photography , several lively kill scenes , and a properly spooky atmosphere that positively reeks with ominous portent . The performances are uniformly stellar as well , with Peter Riegert giving a wonderfully rough-edged portrayal of a coarse , irascible , candy-noshing homicide detective and delightfully crusty cameos by Lawrence Tierney as a gruff police chief , William Hickey as a flaky elderly mythology expert , and Arthur Malet as an amiably yappy fuddy dud museum curator . Dynamic , thrilling and refreshingly bereft of any needless pretense or condescending campy humor , this vastly entertaining and charmingly old-fashioned fright film overall rates as one completely worthwhile and satisfying bloodthirsty behemoth on the loose in the Big Apple horror blast .
518601	8239592	74540	8.0	A delightfully dreadful 70's killer mutant animals running amok horror howler	Notorious Grade D fright flick schlockmeister extraordinaire Bert I . Gordon really outdoes himself with this deliciously cheesy cinematic bastardization of a classic H . G . Wells short story . Some mysterious gloop which bubbles forth from out of the ground causes all the animals such as rats , wasps and even chickens ( ! ) on an isolated island to mutate into deadly , grotesque and gigantic rampaging monsters which attack and chow down on a handful of hapless humans who include former child evangelist turned hack 70's drive-in picture perennial Marjoe Gortner ( sporting a very mod Mr . Brady-style white guy Afro ) , an extremely obnoxious Ralph Meeker , the ever-adorable Pamela ( " And Soon the Darkness " ) Franklin , future " Hill Street Blues " TV show regular Jon Cypher , and Ida Lupino ( the latter gives a hilariously over-the-top histrionic performance complete with an uproariously ripe Quaker Oats-type accent ) . Man , does this baby boast all the right so - totally - tacky - its - downright - tremendous crummy junk film stuff : embarrassingly hysterical acting from a choice exploitation feature cast ( Marjoe in particular is his usual reliably wretched self while Franklin let's it all hang out as a coarse lady scientist who curses worse than a truck driver ) , seriously stinky ( not remotely ) special effects , a few genuinely gross and creepy moments ( the sequence where Lupino is assaulted in her kitchen by these disgusting big worms is truly unsettling ) , and plenty of unintentionally funny scenes ( the giant crazed rooster which Gortner fights in a barn and kills with a pitchfork is absolutely sidesplitting ) . Among the other highlights to be witnessed in this splendidly shoddy swill are Lupino exclaiming " Oh Laa-wd , please don't let me be eaten by the raaa-hhts , " a pregnant Belinda Balaski going into labor as the rats besiege a farmhouse she's trapped in , and a meat cleaver-brandishing Lupino's incredible confrontation with one of the ferocious over-sized rodents . A topflight trashy treat .
519001	8239592	87127	8.0	A deliciously cheesy chunk of early 80's low-budget sword and sorcery sleaze	Muscular blond-maned wannabe heroic scruffy barbarian Deathstalker ( the hunky Rick Hill ) gets assigned by the all powerful King Tulak to rescue his lovely fair maiden daughter Princess Codille ( stunningly beautiful'n'bountiful Playboy Playmate Barbi Benton ) from the vile clutches of evil sorcerer Oghris ( a delectably hammy performance by Richard Brooker ; Jason in " Friday the 13th Part III " ) . Aiding Deathstalker on his dangerous mission are lecherous wizard Munkar ( the funny Bernard Erhard ) , brawny mercenary Kang ( dorky Victor Bo ) , and feisty warrior babe Kaira ( the luscious Lana Clarkson ) . Director James Sbardellatti , working from a blithely low-brow script by Howard R . Cohen ( who also wrote " Unholy Rollers " and " Space Raiders " ) , loads this delightfully cheap'n'cheesy sleaze exploitation sword and sorcery fantasy romp with a tasty plenitude of gratuitous nudity ( both Barbi and Lana bare their hot bods ) , ineptly staged swordfights , mudwrestling half-naked slave girls , a reasonable amount of bloody violence , a kung-fu fight , and even a huge hulking humanoid pigman freak . Sure , this hilariously dopey dreck definitely ain't no work of sophisticated cinematic art , but it still does the trick just the same as a pleasingly trashy little hoot .
519153	8239592	69850	8.0	An enjoyable slice of giallo Eurotrash fun	A vicious killer brutally bumps off prostitutes at a swanky Paris bordello run by the stern Madame Colette ( the lovely Anita Ekberg ) . The hard-boiled Inspector Pontaine ( an amusing performance by Humphrey Bogart impersonator Robert Sacchi ) investigates the murders . Propable suspects include the hot-headed Antoine Gottvalles ( moody Peter Martell ) , smarmy nightclub owner Pepi ( slimy Rolf Eden ) , and sinister Professor Waldemar ( Jess Franco film regular Howard Vernon ) . Director Ferdinando Merighi maintains a snappy pace throughout as well as delivers a smattering of sleazy soft-core sex , a sprinkling of tasty gratuitous female nudity , and a few dollops of tacky gore ( a couple of cheesy decapitations rate as the definite splatter highlights ) . Moreover , Merighi stages the grisly murder set pieces with deliciously garish psychedelic stylistic aplomb . The always welcome and enticing presences of beautiful cult Eurobabe starlets Barbara ( " Don't Torture A Duckling " ) Bouchet , Rosalba ( " The Arena " ) Neri , and Evelyn ( " The Mighty Peking Man " ) Kraft qualifies as another substantial asset . The polished cinematography by Mario Mancini and Gunter Otto makes nifty occasional use of a hand-held camera . Bruno Nicolai's pretty and melodic , yet groovy and jazzy score really hits the funky spot . Italian peblum muscleman star Gordon Mitchell pops up in a bit part as a nightclub patron . Good , trashy fun .
517912	8239592	86967	8.0	An enjoyably crummy earthbound " Alien " rip-off by the ever-reliable Fred Olen Ray	An entertaining , incredibly idiotic , and basically all-thumbs mid-80's earthbound " Alien " clone from the forever fumble-fingered Grade D dreckmonger Fred Olen Ray , who once again shows off his characteristic consummate ineptitude and flagrant disregard for anything remotely resembling professional film-making . Besides an obviously inebriated Aldo Ray delivering one of his single most horrendous performances as an irascible , constantly tongue-tied army general , Fred's then five-year-old son Christopher shambling about in a pitifully unconvincing rubber monster suit , a hilarious rockabilly ending credits theme song called " Rockabilly Rumble " performed by Johnny Legend and the Skullcaps , and plenty of Fred's patented crappy touches ( dreadful acting , some bloody , but phony gore , excruciatingly labored attempts at no-brainer lowbrow humor , a little gratuitous bare female skin , a smug smartaleck attitude which suggests that Ray might be churning out these cheapie clunkers strictly for the money , and dimly lit nighttime cinematography that's guaranteed to make you blurry-eyed ) , the key reason to give this supremely shoddy stinker a look-see is to watch remarkably buxom erstwhile porn actress Angelique Pettyjohn show off her amazingly ample breasts in a couple of almost literally eye-popping scenes . Now , what more could you possibly ask for in an admittedly el zilcho two-cent " Alien " rip-off ? Well , how about Fred in a quick cameo along with fellow partner - in - schlocky - celluloid - crime Donald G . Jackson ( he who blessed us with " Hell Comes to Frogtown " ) as a medic . Best and funniest moment : When the irate dwarf creature shreds an " E . T . " poster and stomps all over it in an angry jealous rage ! A deliciously cheesy hoot and a half .
519076	8239592	469227	8.0	The best of the " Camp Blood " slasher flicks	Ambitious Jessica ( foxy brunette Stephanie Mathis ) , rugged Russ ( hunky Phil Lander ) , sweet , kooky aspiring singer Kat ( adorable blonde sprite Erin Holt ) , scrappy tomboy Mel ( solid Denise Lorraine ) , and laid-back thrill-seeking rich guy Nolan ( amiable Adam Van Conant ) all volunteer for a reality TV show in which they have to spend a day at the notorious Camp Blood in order to win the $1 million dollar prize money . Sleazeball producer Tony ( a perfectly smarmy David Sobel ) hires slobby stuntman Griff ( an amusingly coarse Jeff Swarthout ) to scare the contestants . But the murderous the Clown ( creepy Alex Gordon ) shows up to do his nasty lethal thing once again . Writer / director Brad Sykes comes up with a surprisingly good and worthwhile third entry in the " Camp Blood " trilogy which proves to be a marked improvement on the previous enjoyably cruddy films : Andrew Gianetta's sharp , polished cinematography , the convincing make-up f / x , the steady pace , Terry M . Huud's eerie'n'funky syncopated score , the bleakly ironic surprise twist ending , a decent smattering of gratuitous female nudity ( Athena Demos as a hot brunette model bares her lovely breasts ) , the genuinely likable main characters ( Kat in particular is an absolute doll ! ) , a reasonable amount of grisly bloodshed , and the acceptable acting from an attractive bunch of unknowns are all uniformly up to speed . Sykes alas fails to generate any real tension , but that minor criticism aside this movie overall sizes up as a fun and satisfying slice'n'dice body count horror romp .
518276	8239592	82639	8.0	A very cool early 80's rock'n'roll cult favorite	Fiery and insolent rebellious teenager Corinne " Third Degree " Burns ( a wonderfully raw and dynamic portrayal by Diane Lane ) is angry about the untimely death of her mother . So she convinces her reluctant sister Tracy ( the cute Marin Kanter ) and her equally surly cousin Jessica ( Laura Dern at her most adorable ) to form a rowdy all-female punk group called the Stains ( who look and sound like an unholy cross between the Shaggs and the Runaways ) . Despite having no real musical talent , the Stains still manage to get a gig as part of a tour along with the past their prime metal band the Metal Corpses ( they stink ) and the snarly punk outfit the Looters ( who seriously smoke ! ) . The Stains become huge stars because of their skimpy stage outfits , outrageous two-tone skunk hairstyles , defiant attitude ( their motto is " We don't put out " ) , and , most of all , extensive media coverage by opportunistic TV news anchorwoman Alicia Meeker ( delightfully played with lip-smacking relish by Cynthia Sikes ) . However , their moment in the spotlight proves to be fleeting when their loyal audience of adolescent girl admirers known as Skunks realize they've been had and turn on the band at a disastrous concert . Director and noted music producer Lou Adler , working from a sharp and abrasive script by Nancy Dowd ( who also wrote " Slap Shot " ) , offers a fiercely cynical and illuminating depiction of the more sordid aspects of the rock music business which include drug use ( one member of the Metal Corpses dies of an overdose ) , performing in seedy dives , mindless consumerism , and especially how the media can either make or break a band . This film further benefits from excellent acting from a fine cast . Lane delivers a positively electrifying performance full of rage and passion that holds the whole picture together . Ray Winstone likewise shines as bitter and cranky , yet wise and knowing punk singer Billy , who tries to be a mentor for Corinne without much success . Christine Lahti only pops up in two scenes as Corinne's neurotic and regretful Aunt Linda , but makes a strong and lasting impression just the same . Special kudos are also in order for Barry Ford , who gives a marvelously engaging turn as laid-back and philosophical Jamaican bus driver Lawnboy . Plus there's nice support from David Clennon as sleazy agent Dave Robell , Fee Waybill as washed-up rocker Lou Corpse , John Lehne as smarmy newscaster Stu McGrath , and E . G . Daily as a perky hotel maid . Appearing as members of the Looters are erstwhile Sex Pistols Paul Cook and Steve Jones and Paul Simonon of the Clash . Horror scream queen Debbie Rochon makes her feature film debut an uncredited bit part as a Skunk . The gritty , yet polished cinematography by Bruce Surtees comes through with plenty of striking visuals and spot-on evocative shots of often dreary and grungy locations . A tad rough around the edges , but overall a really fun and rollicking blast of a movie .
518141	8239592	51622	8.0	A nifty 50's sci-fi / horror classic	Brilliant , hearty , but obsessive scientist Andre Delambre ( an excellent performance by David Hedison ) creates a teleportation device . Things go awry when his genes are crossed with those of a common fly , thereby resulting in a grotesque humanoid insect monster . Andre's loyal and loving wife Helene ( superbly played by the lovely Patricia Owens ) desperately tries to help him out , but his humanity starts to fade as the days wear on . Director Kurt Neumann , working from an absorbing and intelligent script by James Clavell , relates the arresting , if wildly implausible story at a steady pace , maintains an admirably serious and sincere tone throughout , and elicits uniformly fine acting from a first-rate cast . Hedison and Owens are outstanding in the leads ; they receive sound support from the ever-suave Vincent Price as Andre's concerned brother Francois , Herbert Marshall as the smooth Inspector Charas , comic actress Kathleen Freeman in a nifty change-of-pace straight part as housekeeper Emma , and Charles Herbert as Andre's sweet son Philippe . The vibrant color cinematography by Karl Struss makes exquisite use of the widescreen format . Paul Sawtell's lush , rousing orchestral score really hits the shuddery spot . The special effects are quite good and convincing . The revelation of the fly head atop Andre's body still packs a punch today ; ditto the now legendary ending scene with Andre's head on a fly's body pathetically screaming " Help me ! " while trapped in a spider's web . Moreover , this film gains considerable dramatic power from the fact that at the plot's core is a genuinely tragic and poignant love story . Although a bit slow and talky by modern standards , this picture overall is still worthy of its classic status .
518340	8239592	491005	8.0	A nifty killer animal horror flick	A flock of ravens contract mad cow's disease and turn into vicious carnivorous beasts who attack the populace of a sleepy small town . A handful of folks who include the stalwart Police Chief Wayne Merkle ( a solid Sean Patrick Flanery ) , amiable physician Doc ( winningly played by Rod Taylor ) , and recovering alcoholic school bus driver Clyde ( the excellent Stephen McHattie ) do their best to survive this harrowing ordeal . Director Sheldon Wilson , working from a smart , tight script by Benjamin Sztajnkrycer , relates the absorbing story at a steady pace , maintains a serious tone throughout ( there's a refreshing absence of any silly humor ) , and effectively builds a considerable amount of suspense . The tense gradual build-up of the opening act eventually culminates in an especially harrowing and exciting last third . Moreover , the ravens are genuinely creepy , the explanation for the birds ' violent behavior is both plausible and topical , the CGI effects are surprisingly decent and acceptable , and there's a handy helping of grisly gore ( the mangled victims of the bird attacks look pretty nasty ) . Nice supporting performances by Kristin Booth as Wayne's caring wife Cynthia , John Ralston as superstitious Mennonite farmer Oskar , Michelle Duquet as friendly diner owner Betty , Ashley Newbrough as mean teen Doris , Gray Powell as eager deputy Stan , Vladimir Bondarenko as strict farmer Jacob , Megan Park as Oskar's sweet daughter Gretchen , and Wendy Lyon as perky police dispatcher Luanne . Both John Tarver's polished cinematography and Steven London's shuddery score are up to speed . An enjoyable fright feature .
518680	8239592	86873	8.0	An excellent and enjoyable comic vehicle for both Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin	The spirit of uptight dying rich spinster Edwina Cutwaters ( superbly played by Lily Tomlin ) gets accidentally transferred into the body of swinging bachelor lawyer Roger Cobb ( Steve Martin in fine and inspired form ) . The two radically opposite personalities are forced to share the same body until they can get wacky swami Prahka Lasa ( a delightfully kooky Richard Libertini ) to put Edwina's soul into the body of shameless and conniving slut Terry Hoskins ( a deliciously naughty portrayal by the lovely Victoria Tennant ) . Director Rob Reiner and screenwriter Phil Alden Robinson devise an ideal showcase for the major comic talents of both Martin and Tomlin : The original wild and crazy Steve performs plenty of frantic physical humor with amazing skill and agility while Tomlin brings a genuinely moving pathos to the initially unappealing character of the sad and repressed Edwina . Better still , there's a good deal of genuine heart and warmth amid all the zany slapstick , with the two main characters becoming more endearing and sympathetic as the story unfolds . Roger Cobb in particular is a likable eccentric who talks to his beloved dog and aspires to be a jazz musician . Martin and Tomlin do sterling work in the lead roles ; they receive sound support from Tennant , Libertini , Jason Bernard as Roger's loyal , laid-back blind saxophone player pal Tyrone Wattell , Dana Elcar as amorous law firm head Burton Schuyler , Michael Ensign as prissy lawyer Mr . Mifflin , Madolyn Smith as Roger's fiery fiancé Peggy , Eric Christmas as Terry's cranky stableman dad Fred , and Selma Diamond as Roger's sunny secretary Margo . It's a real treat watching Martin and Tomlin bounce off each other ; sidesplitting highlights include Roger getting Edwina to help him go to the bathroom ( priceless line : " How dare you say penis to a dead person " ) , Edwina spoiling Roger's attempt at making love to Terry , and the wonderfully exuberant final scene . A total hoot .
518990	8239592	90169	8.0	An enjoyably silly car chase action romp	Few studios could rival Cannon back in the 80's when it came to cranking out slickly mounted give the audience what they've paid to see action / adventure potboilers . Sure , their films were usually pretty empty-headed and utterly lacking in originality , but they delivered the goods just the same in an admirably precise and economical manner . " Thunder Run " is a solid example of Cannon's winning formula : it's simple , basic and to the point . Forrest Tucker in his final film role affably portrays Charlie Morrison , a crusty crackerjack gear-gammer and Korean war veteran who's hired by crafty government agent John Ireland to haul a load of plutonium freight across a long , lonely stretch of Nevada desert backroads . Naturally , there's one immense hitch : a lethal band of nuclear terrorists led by a sensationally slimy Alan Rachins want to steal the plutonium , so Morrison , assisted by his loving grandson Chris ( likable John Shepherd ) , stacks the odds more in his favor by building himself an almighty , heavily armored , tank-like 65-foot 18-wheeler supertruck called " Big Thunder . " Gary Hudson's vigorous direction ensures that this tightly efficient B-picture chase thriller storms along in a pleasingly straightforward and single-minded manner akin to Morrison's truck : we've got a ceaseless rapid-fire pace , gritty , here's-dirt-in-your-eye ground level camera-work by Harvey Genkins , amusingly dopey adolescent sex hi-jinks ( a klutzy stringbean electronics whiz kid dweeb does just what you think with a gorgeously slinky blonde babe ) , an incessantly pounding score by Jay Levy , frequent bright yellow explosions , a terrifically trashy hard rock soundtrack , engaging characters ( Jill Whitlow of " Night of the Creeps " fame is especially endearing as Chris ' sweet girlfriend ) , a few lovably cheesy gimmicks ( would you believe outrageously garish , camouflage-painted Volkswagons equipped with rocker launchers ? ) , and , most importantly , more wild , careening , knock-you-out-of-your-seat frantic and exciting piston-pumping car chase action than you can shake a tire iron at . Okay , as far as creativity is concerned this puppy's admittedly low on gas , but it still rattles along with a certain rousing streamlined momentum nonetheless .
518968	8239592	82509	8.0	A real funky blast from the 80's past	Made right before the buzz-crushing ultra-conservative religious right backlash against the gloriously loose'n'libertine permissiveness of the 70's took hold , this wonderfully wild'n'raucous animated sci-fi / horror / fantasy anthology film gleefully wallows in excessive graphic violence , crass leering objectification of the amply proportioned female form ( buxom ladies only , please ) , and a wickedly funny line in cheery low-brow humor . This movie sure ain't politically correct - - and that's exactly why it's such a hugely enjoyable blast from the funky early 80's past . An evil glowing orb called the Loknar ( the supremely sinister and velvet smooth voice of Percy Rodriguez ) spreads its malign influence throughout the decades and galaxies . First tale , " Harry Canyon " - Cynical cabbie Harry ( marvelously voiced to weary perfection by veteran character actor Richard Romanus of " Mean Streets " ) gets involved with a sexy young lass in a bleak and rundown futuristic New York . Second yarn , " Den " - A nerdy teenager ( affably voiced by the late , great John Candy ) winds up on another planet where he's transformed into a bald and brawny behemoth . Third romp , " Captain Sternn " - Sleazy scoundrel Captain Sternn stands on trail for his many heinous indiscretions . John Vernon scores strongly as the angry voice of the prosecuting attorney . Fourth opus , " B-17 " - A very creepy and gruesome World War II zombie outing . Fifth vignette , " So Beautiful and So Dangerous " - A couple of wacky aliens and their goofy robot buddy abduct a sassy hot Jewish chick . Harold Ramis and Eugene Levy are hilarious as the Cheech and Chong-style stoner pilots of a giant smiley face spaceship . Candy once again is a delight as the voice of the charming and amorous robot . Sixth outing , " Taarna " - A lethal and lovely mute warrior woman mixes it up with a vicious horde of nasty marauders . Boy , does this picture rate highly as the ideal guy flick : we've got a fantastic roaring rock soundtrack ( Cheap Trick , Black Sabbath , Devo , Grand Funk Railroad , Nazareth , Blue Oyster Cult , Journey , Stevie Nicks and much more ) , plenty of sidesplitting sophomoric humor , stunningly voluptuous and often naked women , a handy helping of gore , a nice smattering of soft-core sex , a blithely breezy'n'carefree tone , and no pretense whatsoever to get in the way of the infectiously trashy fun . The strikingly stylized and varied animation is suitably vivid and garish throughout . Elmer Bernstein's lush majestic orchestral score likewise hits the spot . A real cool treat that's wholly deserving of its cult status .
518649	8239592	82816	8.0	A solid and seriously underrated sleeper	Loosely based on Vicki Lawrence's notoriously trashy country story song , this unexpectedly amiable and engrossing dramatic feature about ordinary small-time dreamers who aspire to greater things in life makes for a perfectly nice and affecting character-oriented slice-of-everyday-life affair , specifically centering on how going for the gold in life takes a lot of courage and determination . Dennis Quaid portrays his part with a winningly scruffy , roguish charm ; he's a reckless ne'er-do-well womanizing hellion striving to make it big in Nashville as a country singer . Kristy McNichol is likewise on the money , radiating her usual spunky appeal as Quaid's headstrong , ambitious and highly precocious 16-year-old sister who acts as Quaid's manager and does her best to keep her wayward brother in line . The duo's major league plans go astray when Quaid runs afoul of belligerent sticksville town sheriff Don Stroud . Quaid , Stroud and McNicol all give fine performances , but it's Mark Hamill who takes the acting honors with his shockingly good turn as the decent , sympathetic state trooper who befriends McNicol and falls in love with her . Director Ronald F . Maxwell shows a lovely , uplifting sure feel for these hugely endearing commonplace individuals , depicting their mundane lives and go-for-the-glory aspirations without the slightest whiff of cheap sentiment or condescension . Moreover , the country music score totally cooks , with both Quaid and McNicol contributing a few surprisingly up-to-par tunes ( yes , they both sing - - and extremely well , too ! ) . Granted , this flick ain't without its flaws : the meandering opening third starts off pretty shaky and the tragic ending is abrupt and dissatisfying . But overall this unjustly overlooked picture rates as a real sleeper .
518955	8239592	71413	8.0	A nicely twisted 70's killer kid horror gem	A bus bound for a mental institution containing a quintet of psychologically unbalanced and murderous children runs off the road and goes tumbling down a cliff , killing the driver in the process ( this opening scene is quite jarring and splendidly staged ) . The deadly brats survive the accident and take refuge at a swanky winter resort run by the mean , irascible , browbeating Papa Doc ( a deliciously dour Gene Evans , a longtime favorite of Samuel Fuller who was in Sam Peckinpah's last two Westerns " The Ballad of Cable Hogue " and " Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid " ) . Pretty soon the killer kids go on a rampage : they junk the guests ' cars , cut the power lines , and begin to violently off Papa Doc's arrogant , decadent , back-stabbing clientèle ( a lady gets set ablaze after being drenched with gasoline , another hapless lass has piranha dumped in her bathtub , that sort of ghastly stuff ) . This thoroughly sick and therefor most compelling psycho thriller marked the impressive debut of promising horror movie one shot wonder Sean MacGregor , who proved with this creepy , unique and wickedly warped humdinger that he could make one hell of a fright flick ( MacGregor's sole other horror picture credit was writing the story for the eerily offbeat rural Devil worship chiller " The Brotherhood of Satan " ) . The astonishingly brutal scene where the terrible tykes beat their psychiatrist to death with chains , hammers , knives and even a pitchfork attests to this claim ; this excruciatingly elongated sequence makes artful and unforgettably potent use of both grainy black and white still photographs and painfully amplified sound effects . The other murder set pieces aren't nearly as ferocious , but since they're perpetuated by smiling , seemingly harmless and innocent kids they still pack a serious wallop just the same - - and all are punctuated with strangely startling freeze frames . John Durren's barbed , deeply judgmental script possesses a conspicuously angry and borderline hostile sense of moral outrage . There's a deep-seated disgust for the pervasive amorality , hedonism and narcissism that was a true hallmark of the 70's which in turn gives this feature an additional biting resonance . ( Durren also acts in the movie as Ralph , a sweet , guileless , retarded handyman who the other adults mercilessly mock and push around . ) The cast deserve appraisal as well , with especially solid work from Sorrell Booke ( Boss Hog on " The Dukes of Hazzard " ) as a meek , peevish physician and Joan ( " Act of Veangeance , " " Grizzly " ) McCall as the only decent grown-up . 70's teen idol Leif Garrett is surprisingly good as one of the nefarious little rugrats . Odd , often jolting and extremely twisted , this funky little sleeper stands out as one of the best entries in the always worthwhile and enjoyable killer kid horror sub-genre .
518358	8239592	78990	8.0	An amiably silly redneck comedy romp	Tom Selleck and Jerry Reed are utterly engaging as rascally , penniless , down-on-their-luck cowboy drifters Will and J . D . , who find themselves stuck in Nashville , Tennesse . A lovely young woman ( the gorgeous Morgan Fairchild ) mistakes the pair for private detectives and hires the affable duo to find her missing sister . Pretty soon both Will and J . D . are neck deep in all kinds of trouble . Briskly directed by Burt Kennedy , with a slight , inane cookie cutter script by Jimmy Sangster , crude cinematography by Victor Salzis and Alan Stensvold , a jaunty hillbilly bluegrass country score by Reed ( who also sings the rousing theme song " Breakin ' Loose " ) and the expected copious slapstick fist fights and wacky car chases , this totally inconsequential piece of made-for-TV piffle makes for a perfectly enjoyable diversion . The loose'n'wiggy chemistry between Selleck and Reed is a treat to watch . Solid supporting turns by Claude Akins as a famous country singer / songwriter , Gene Evans as a gruff police lieutenant , Lucille Benson as a stern , but friendly whorehouse madam , and Grace Zabriskie as a wax museum worker are likewise delightful . Special guest appearances by country stars Roy Acuff , Ray Stevens and Barbara Mandrell as themselves further add to the goofy fun . A likably silly timewaster .
518246	8239592	71323	8.0	Nifty martial arts mortality tale	Decent , honest , simple Chinese country farmhand and ace martial artist Tai-Lin ( a fine and likable performance by Jason Pai Piao ) goes to a big city in the Phillippines to seek his fortune . Tai-Lin befriends scruffy petty street hoodlum Siao-Mao ( amusingly played to the wormy hilt by Ruel Vernal ) and gets a job as a dock worker . When Tai-Lin discovers that the people he works for are part of a crime syndicate that specializes in smuggling opium , he quits his job and joins forces with both fierce black boxer Ron Van Clief and equally formidable Filipino boxer Jorge Estraga against the evil organization . Director Chin-Ku Lu tells the serious and compelling story about morality , integrity and corruption in an effectively plain and straightforward manner while maintaining a snappy pace throughout and staging the plentiful rock ' em , rock ' em chopsocky fisticuffs with considerable aplomb . Moreover , Lu manages to add a few poignant moments amid all the expected stirring kung-fu carnage ; the relationship between Tai-Lin and Siao-Mao is quite warm and touching . Piao makes for a very strong and appealing protagonist as the naive and innocent Tai-Lin ; he receives sound support from Nancy Veronica as the sweet Ching Kwei , Thompson Kao Kong as Tai-Lin's smug , slick , arrogant hotshot successful brother Chi-Fu-Shi , and Subas Herrero as a smarmy flunky for the bad guys . The neatly varied score alternates between sappy orchestral mush and jaunty hillbilly bluegrass ( complete with fiddle and banjo ! ) . The big showdown between our heroes and the villains is very lively and exciting . A cool little movie .
519175	8239592	79803	8.0	An immensely enjoyable piece of chopsocky action junk	Shrewd , suave Chang Wong ( a solid and amiable performance by the handsome and charismatic Bruce Li ) and his redoubtable female partner ( superbly essayed with delicious vigor by the foxy Angela Mao ) devise an elaborate scheme to take out a heroin drug ring led by the nefarious Paul ( nicely played by the enormous Paul Smith of " Popeye " and " Dune " fame ) . Moreover , Chang also works for a rival dope-dealing organization in order to further stir things up . Director Jimmy Shaw crams this baby with a handy helping of hugely entertaining good stuff : wall-to-wall fierce and crazy martial arts fights , several groovy nightclub scenes ( the funky-chillin ' house band is simply amazing ! ) , a couple of brutal garrotings , inspired occasional use of strenuous slow motion , a nonstop speedy pace , a wild free-for-all confrontation between the two criminal factions , and a fantastic rousing climactic showdown between Li and Smith in which Li's graceful physical agility is pitted against Smith's fearsome brute strength . Chou Fu Liang's awesomely gnarly throbbing disco score hits the soulful spot . Chiou Yao-Hwu's reasonably polished cinematography likewise makes the grade . Best of all , the lovely Ms . Mao looks smoking hot in a sparkling silver jumpsuit and beats the living tar out of a teeming volume of guys . What's not to like about this totally fun vintage 70's grindhouse flick ?
519357	8239592	114608	8.0	A real wild and gory blast of a horror flick	Mysterious drifter Brayker ( superbly played by William Sadler ) possesses the last of seven ancient keys that the demonic , yet charismatic Collector ( deliciously essayed with lip-smacking sardonic panache by Billy Zane ) needs to acquire in order to destroy humanity . Brayker seeks refuge in a rundown motel . The Collector and his army of lethal , grotesquely ugly ghouls lay siege to the joint . Ably directed with considerable rip-snorting flair by Ernest Dickerson , with slick cinematography by Rick Bota , a handy helping of graphic gore ( gruesome highlights include a fist punched through a head and an arm being ripped off ) , unusually well-drawn and engaging characters , a rousing score by Ed Shearmur , an admirably straight tone , and inspired touches of pitch-black gallows humor , this movie delivers a fast-paced package of fun and frights . Sadler and Zane are terrific in the leads ; they receive excellent support from Jada Pinkett-Smith as spunky ex-con Jerryline , CCH Pounder as tough , cynical motel proprietor Irene , Brenda Bakke as forlorn prostitute Cordelia , Thomas Haden Church as sleazy abject coward Roach , Dick Miller as lovable old drunk Uncle Willie , John Schuck as ramrod Sheriff Tupper , Charles Fleischer as the meek Wally , and Gary Farmer as bumbling Deputy Bob Martel . A very solid and satisfying horror picture .
518316	8239592	66940	8.0	A neat little Italian crime drama	Honest , dedicated Commissioner Bonavia ( superbly played by Martin Balsam ) risks both his life and career in order to arrest wily , powerful and evasive mobster Ferdinando D'Ambrosio ( a marvelously slimy portrayal by Luciano Catenacci ) . Bonavia clashes with shrewd , smooth and by-the-book young district attorney Traini ( the always fine Franco Nero ) over the questionable methods he uses to nab D'Ambrosio . Director Damiano Damiani , who also co-wrote the sharp , complex and intriguing script with Salvatore Laurani , relates the absorbing story at a steady pace and does an expert job of maintaining a serious and gritty tone throughout . The uniformly sound acting from a tip-top cast rates as another substantial plus : Balsam and Nero both excel in their meaty roles , with fine support from Marilu Tolo as D'Ambrosio's frightened old flame Serena LiPuma , Giancarlo Prete as gutsy union organizer Rizzo , Claudio Gora as crooked attorney general Judge Malta , Arturo Dominici as shifty mafia shyster lawyer Canistraro , and Adolfo Lastretti as dangerous , unhinged hoodlum LiPuma . Both Riz Ortolani's moody , melodic score and Claudio Ragona's polished cinematography are up to speed . The potent central message about pervasive corruption and travesties of justice packs one hell of a strong punch . Moreover , the film's tough , no-nonsense sensibility stays grimly true to itself to the literal bitter end . Those expecting your usual nasty and sleazy shoot ' em up action picture will be disappointed , but fans of more demanding and complicated fare should appreciate this admirably ambitious and intelligent character study of two radically contrasting law enforcers . Well worth a look .
517918	8239592	63980	8.0	A deliciously sordid 60s soft-core sleazefest	A psychiatrist treats a bevy of lovely , but deviant female patients . Said patients are a pretty messed-up bunch . Sadist Vickie derives sick kicks from beating up guys and then tying them up . Unhappily married Sherry is addicted to engaging in dirty sex with total strangers . Insatiable teenage nympho Kathy just can't get enough . Married couple Fred and Janet enjoy having a threesome with lesbian Barbara . Director George Rodgers , working from a trashy script by Martin Lathrop , delivers plenty of in-your-face explicit nudity and really raunchy soft-core sex . A heavy-handed narrator babbles incessantly about the girls ' severe sexual hang-ups . H . M . Schultz's rough , grainy black and white photography greatly adds to the pervasive seediness . Arthur Lindsey's wild free-form jazz score likewise does the groovy trick . The wonderfully wretched theme song is downright hilarious . Best of all , the women look quite attractive and aren't the least bit bashful about showing off their nice natural naked bodies at pleasingly regular intervals . Moreover , there's all kinds of seamy carnal activity on display throughout . A satisfyingly scuzzy slice of pure unadulterated junk .
518599	8239592	56233	8.0	A nifty nudie fantasy romp	Young marine biologist Dr . Samuel Jamison ( a likable performance by director George Rowe in his only acting gig ) discovers a bunch of lovely and enticing lady mermaids while searching for buried treasure located deep in the ocean nearby an isolated Mexican island . Writer / director John Lamb gives this simple tale a certain sweet and strangely innocent charm . Moreover , Lamb also maintains a steady pace throughout and brings a sense of genuine awe to the fantastic subject matter . The actresses who portray the titular topless sea sirens are quite attractive and well-endowed ; Diane Webber and Gaby Martone in particular are totally ravishing . Popping up in cool supporting roles are the singular Timothy Carey as nasty no-count criminal creep Milo Sangster , Jose Gonzales-Gonzales as excitable Mexican fisherman Pepe Gallardo , and John Mylong as weird old gent Ernst Steinhauer . Lamb's beautiful bright color cinematography offers a wondrous wealth of stunning visuals ( the underwater photography is often very striking ) . Richard La Selle's lush , stirring orchestral likewise hits the melodic spot . An enjoyable little flick .
519419	8239592	66950	8.0	An entertaining comedic pirate romp	Wily and suave buccaneer Blackie ( a smooth and charming portrayal by the always solid Terence Hill ) clashes with several fellow pirate captains while trying to get exclusive dibs on both a fortune in gold and enticing fair damsel Isabel ( the ravishing Silvia Monti ) . Director Lorenzo Gicca Palli and screenwriter George Martin ( who also appears in the movie as Blackie's bumbling destitute partner Don Predro ) concoct an amiably silly tongue-in-cheek swashbuckler that unfolds at a steady pace while offering a winning blend of colorful characters , a flavorsome period setting ( the sets and costumes are both impressively lavish ) , and plenty of lively action which includes the expected rousing sword fights and no-holds-barred rough'n'tumble fisticuffs . This jolly affair further benefits from spirited acting from an engaging cast : Hill displays his usual affable charisma as Blackie , Monti is simply luscious as Isabel , Bud Spencer is suitably redoubtable as Blackie's gruff rival Skull , plus there are neat supporting contributions by Diana Lorys as feisty barmaid Manuela , Edmund Purdom as the irritable viceroy , Monica Randall as the fetching Carmen , Sal Borgese as the kindly Martin , Pasquale Basile as primitive brute Stiller , and Fernando Bilbao as hulking strongman Moko . Jaime Deu Casas ' polished cinematography gives the picture a nice sense of scope . Gino Peguri's jaunty score likewise hits the cheery spot . An enjoyable flick .
518525	8239592	165230	8.0	A hilariously horrendous high camp hoot	Virtuous white ninja Gordon ( the ever suave Richard Harrison ) vows revenge on the evil Kogan ( outrageously overplayed with eye-rolling hammy brio by Tao Chiang ) and his no-count squad of nasty black ninjas after they murder his sweet girlfriend Lori ( the lovely Maria Francesca in a too brief cameo ) . Meanwhile , Kogan enlists the aid of a wicked witch to conjure up spirits in order to get a family out of a house on a patch of land with a secret treasure hidden on it . Writer / director Godfrey Ho delivers an undeniably clumsy , incoherent and nonsensical , yet often sidesplitting and hence hugely entertaining blend of martial arts and supernatural elements into a gloriously ludicrous cinematic hodgepodge that comes complete with lousy dubbing , plain cinematography by Raymond Chang , a frantic nonstop pace , hysterically inept fight scenes , some tasty gratuitous female nudity , a smidgen of soft-core sex ( a hot amorous ghost lady seduces a guy while he's sleeping in bed with his wife ! ) , campy bad guys , cheesy ( not so ) special effects , a funky , syncopated discoid score , and an annoying little boy named Bobo . Moreover , we also get such choice gut-busting moments as a severed head in a basket and the ghost girl masturbating as she watches the guy make love to his wife . Yeah , this flick is by no means a refined work of subtle and sophisticated celluloid art , but it does possess a certain loopy charm and wiggy energy which makes it a lot of fun to watch . A deliciously crummy schlock riot .
518181	8239592	68230	8.0	A hugely enjoyable all-star British Amicus horror anthology romp	Young psychiatrist Dr . Martin ( the always fine Robert Powell ) goes to a sanitarium for the incurably insane for a job interview . He expects to talk to one Dr . Starr , but winds up conversing with the wheelchair-bound Dr . Rutherford ( a marvelous Patrick Magee ) instead . Rutherford challenges Martin to find out who among the four patients is Dr . Starr . If Martin chooses the right one he gets the job . First and most gruesome tale , " Frozen Fear " - The disembodied body parts of the snippy murdered Ruth ( the perfectly bitchy Sylvia Simms ) come back to lethal life to exact a grisly revenge on both her weak faithless husband Walter ( a superbly sniveling Richard Todd ) and his sexy mistress Bonnie ( the solid Barbara Parkins ) . Second and most poignant anecdote , " The Weird Tailor " - Poor kindly tailor Bruno ( the excellent Barry Morse ) is hired by the mysterious Mr . Smith ( beautifully played by the great Peter Cushing ) to sew together a suit out of a strange white fabric which has the ability to resurrect the dead . Third and weakest story , " Lucy Comes to Stay " - Troubled schizophrenic Barbara ( the gorgeous Charlotte Rampling ) blames her naughty alter ego Lucy ( the equally ravishing Britt Ekland ) for killing her brother . This particular episode is way too slight and obvious to really work , but fortunately the delectable distaff eye candy provided by striking beauties Rampling and Ekland ensure that it remains watchable enough throughout . Fourth and most outrageous yarn , " Mannikins of Horror " - Mad Dr . Byron ( a delightfully deranged Herbert Lom ) transfers his spirit into a diminutive , but dangerous mechanical doll facsimile of himself so it can embark on a deadly spree . Director Roy Ward Baker makes the most out of the macabre merriment that's richly abundant in revered " Psycho " novelist Robert Bloch's wickedly witty script . Baker ably creates a properly creepy atmosphere and elicits sterling performances from a top-drawer all-star cast . Denys Coop's crisp , handsome cinematography and Douglas Gamley's robustly booming'n'bombastic score are likewise on the money effective . The wraparound segment's conclusion is truly shocking and unexpected as well . An immensely entertaining omnibus outing .
518642	8239592	89963	8.0	An enjoyably trashy piece of biker exploitation schlock	Rough'n'tumble , laconic , no-nonsense former Green Beret Vietnam veteran Stryker ( a typically fine performance by Lance Henrikson ) goes to visit his old soldier buddy Tick Rand ( the always affable George Kennedy ) in a small Arizona desert town . Unfortunately , a gang of ferocious bikers led by the vicious Pigiron ( William Forsythe snarling it up with his customary rip-snorting brio ) are terrorizing the community . It's up to Stryker and Rand to put a permanent stop to these nasty no-count hooligans . Competently directed by Simon Nuchtern , with polished cinematography by Gerald Freil , a decent smattering of gratuitous nudity , a funky , syncopated score by Pino Donaggio , well-developed main characters ( there's a nice chemistry between Kennedy and Henrikson ) , and a handy helping of raw violence , this grungy biker version of the classic Western " Shane " makes for an entertainingly scrappy affair . The cool cast of familiar B-feature faces helps matters a whole lot : Karen Black as two-bit floozy barmaid Rachel , Richard Lynch as lecherous weakling priest Reverand Romano , Claudia Udy as Tick's tough hottie daughter Katie , Leo Gordon as the gruff , but ineffectual sheriff , Mickey Jones as evil Harley hound Zero , and wildman stand-up comedian Sam Kinison in a funny bit part as an obnoxious born again Christian barber . Good , low-brow fun .
519423	8239592	72695	8.0	An offbeat and interesting 70's road movie curio	Mature , stable Jesse ( a solid performance by Richard Hatch ; Apollo on " Battlestar Galactica " ) , his more nutty and impulsive immature best friend Pat ( an effectively loopy and intense portrayal by Doug Chapin ) , Jesse's caring fiancé Kathy ( nicely played by the lovely Susanne Benton of " A Boy and His Dog " fame " ) , and Pat's fragile gal pal Jo Ella ( essayed with sweet charm by the cute Ann Noland ) all decide to embark on a cross country road trip in a Winnebago prior to facing the challenges of encroaching adulthood . Relationships between everyone become increasingly strained by this journey : Jesse has a fling with Jo Ella , Pat attempts to rape Kathy , and the whole thing culminates with the now deranged Pat terrorizing the other three on a beach while riding around on a motorcycle . As the above plot synopsis alone suggests , this film sure ain't your standard crude'n'sleazy Crown International Pictures drive-in exploitation fare . Granted , this feature does deliver the expected soft-core sex and tasty female nudity ( Jo Ella does a wild impromptu tabletop striptease at a funky bar ) , but director Noel Nosseck and screenwriter Arnold Somkin focus more on low-key and incisive introspection rather than the usual seedy thrills . The gradual pace and character-driven plot take a little getting use to , but thankfully this movie hits an appealingly mellow and laid-back distinctly 70's groove early on and offers some poignant insights into the difficulty of growing up and facing responsibility . Moreover , there are quite a few bitter truths to be found in the tense and homoerotic friendship between Jesse and Pat . The acting from the attractive and personable young cast is uniformly strong , with Hatch in particular the stand-out among the bunch . Stephen M . Katz's bright , sunny , sparkling cinematography makes exquisite occasional use of fades and dissolves . Rick Cunha's catchy country-rock score likewise does the trick . An intriguing and ultimately pretty touching oddity .
519091	8239592	250390	8.0	A very lively and enjoyably over-the-top direct-to-video " Duel " variant	Boy , am I in the minority about this particular film . You see , I thought this movie was a lot of good , silly , rousing fun . Sure , it's a cheesy B-picture , but it does the trick and delivers the stirring goods , which makes it a solid film in my book . Okay , with that obligatory explanation stuff out of the way let's get on with this here review . After they accidentally cut off an ominous giant black pick-up truck on the highway , both dashing limousine driver Jim Travis ( firmly played by perennial straight-to-cable TV feature topliner Casper Van Dien ) and his fetching female passenger Sonia Walker ( the very cute Danielle Brett ) end up being relentlessly terrorized on an isolated patch of sticksville mountainside backroads by the pick-up's dangerously unbalanced and irritable wombat driver . Veteran director Sidney J . Furie tackles the admittedly trite " Duel " rehash material with commendable flair and aptitude , keeping the pace sprightly and unwavering throughout , creating a reasonable amount of tension , and staging several truly spectacular bash ' em , crash ' em and smash ' em up car chases and automobile stunts with smack dead on-target exciting results . Moreover , both leads turn in personable performances , the dialogue possesses real snap and wit , there are a few genuinely startling plot twists , the blaring rock score totally smokes , and , most importantly , we've got no pretense whatsoever to be found in a single fleet frame of this amazingly vigorous and galvanizing little beaut .
518994	8239592	90006	8.0	A lively and hugely enjoyable car chase romp	Cliff Robertson contributes one of his sturdy , pleasant , reassuring reliable old pro portrayals as Judd Pierson , a crusty , disillusioned crackerjack race car driver whose career has hit the skids . Despite the efforts of loyal , adoring , wide-eyed mechanic Casey ( a likably relaxed performance by boyish , fluffy-haired 70's teen heartthrob Leif Garrett ) , Judd's feeling pretty lousy because he's stuck doing death-defying stunts for a third-rate crash and burn thrill show traveling across New Zealand . So when gutsy , dedicated germ warfare disease researcher Christine Ruben ( lovely Lisa Harrow ) promises to pay Judd $3 , 000 to drive her through some treacherous winding backroads , Casey persuades Judd to accept her offer . But unbeknownst to either Judd or Casey , Ruben takes along a sample of a deadly virus she's been working on ; it's a top secret bug that the company she works for wants back by any means necessary . Naturally , a lethal team of assassins lead by the sublimely snooty slimeball Shane Briant give chase . Director Bruce Morrison , abetted by a briskly efficient screenplay ( said script Morrison co-wrote with James Kouf , Jr . and henry Fownes ) , Stephen McCurdy's jazzy , hard-blasting score , spirited acting by a fine cast , a sharp sense of dry , biting humor ( " There's nothing in our contract about leading us into the valley of death and getting out butts shot off " ) , beauteous New Zealand countryside scenery , and Kevin Hayward's handsome , gleaming cinematography , pumps up the pace and maintains a neck-snappingly fast sense of constant momentum . The awesomely well-mounted chase sequences are staged with lip-smacking verve and a camera gets affixed to the side of the wildly careening automobiles , thereby infusing the rousing proceedings with a jangly , punchy , invigorating vitality . Sure , this honey doesn't cover any fresh chase / action thriller ground , but it certainly goes through the familiar motions in a most satisfyingly dynamic and straightforward manner . In fact , this solid , neatly executed number would make a swell double bill with the somewhat similar and equally kickin ' " The Chain Reaction . "
518965	8239592	120380	8.0	A very solid and enjoyable killer automobile offering	Stephen King's sole directorial effort " Maximum Overdrive " still qualifies as one of the single most horrible cinematic adaptations of his work to date . It's a total mess that's fatally undone by intolerably obnoxious nincompoop characters , sloppy plotting , and a simply dreadful sense of rancidly unamusing toilet bowl humor . Granted , the central premise - - a comet which brushes perilously close to the Earth's atmosphere somehow causes all the trucks to take on a murderously intelligent and malevolent sentient life of their own , with a bunch of demonic semis holding a motley assortment of people hostage in a besieged diner - - was promising , but King's messy , clumsy and horrendously diffuse ( mis ) direction and a narrative ridden with enough gaping plot holes to drive a Diesel through ' em failed to due said premise any justice . Fortunately , this second celluloid take on the short yarn " Trucks " rates as a markedly better and more effective picture : It's smart , absorbing and suspenseful , with sure , low-key direction , a tight , sharply focused script , a few nifty violent episodes ( a mailman getting gruesomely snuffed by a vicious tiny toy dump truck provides a blackly funny highlight ) , a refreshing paucity of both needless pretense and equally unnecessary razzle-dazzle , a commendably straightforward , matter-of-fact , down-to-earth sober tone , realistic sounding dialogue , a genuinely eerie atmosphere of total desolation ( the dry , dusty desert locations help immensely here ) , spare , unflashy cinematography , appealingly plain everyday country folks main characters , and a splendidly bleak surprise ending punching up the quality level to a finely high and well-sustained standard indeed . Timothy Busfield as an affable nice guy gas station proprietor and the fetching Brenda Bakke as the quick-thinking , level-headed heroine lead the uniformly solid no-name cast ( Jay Brazzeau is especially engaging as gentle , philosophical old hippie Jack ) . Moreover , this film mean business throughout and doesn't play fair , actually going as far as to bump off some of the more likable characters . It's this latter element of grim seriousness that makes all the difference , thus enabling a fantastic premise to acquire a reasonable semblance of plausibility which in turn puts this feature over as a good little fright flick .
519050	8239592	63097	8.0	An entertainingly tacky piece of Mexploitation horror schlock	The legendary Boris Karloff ended his illustrious career by making four cheapie fright flick clunkers in Mexico . This is the token moody period Gothic horror entry from the bunch . Karloff gives a typically spry and dignified performance as Matthias Morteval , an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites several of his petty , greedy and backbiting no-count relatives to his creepy rundown castle for the reading of a will . Pretty soon the hateful guests are getting bumped off by lethal life-sized toy people who populate the place . Onetime Mexican sex symbol Andres Garcia of " Tintorera " infamy portrays the dashing police officer hero and Julissa looks absolutely ravishing as the sole likable female character . The clunky , plodding ( non ) direction , trite by-the-numbers script , ugly , washed-out cinematography , ridiculous murder set pieces ( a gross fat slob gets blasted right in the face by a miniature cannon ! ) , overwrought string score , morbid gloom-doom atmosphere , largely lousy acting ( Karloff notably excepted ) , cheesy mild gore , poor dubbing and rousing fiery conclusion all lend this enjoyably awful lemon a certain endearingly cruddy and hence oddly amusing ratty charm . A real campy hoot .
518238	8239592	59045	8.0	A nifty period action drama	Noble Viking warrior Rurik ( a strong and credible portrayal by Cameron Mitchell ) vows to protect the fiery Karin ( well played by the lovely Lisa Wagner ) and her spunky son Moki ( the charming Louis Polletin ) from the vile clutches of the savage Hagen ( a perfectly hateful Frank Ross ) and his army of nasty brutes . Director / co-writer Mario Bava takes a welcome break from his usual horror fare to deliver a surprisingly complex and low-key , but still occasionally exciting period action drama that's essentially a thoughtful and inspired variant on the classic Western " Shane . " Bava relates the absorbing story about revenge , betrayal and loyalty at a steady pace and stages the down'n'dirty fight scenes with considerable brio ( a protracted confrontation between Rurik and Hagen in a tavern rates as a definite thrilling highlight ) . Antonio Rinaldi's breathtaking widescreen cinematography takes full advantage of the beautiful seaside scenery . Marcello Giombini's robust , rousing score likewise does the trick . The cast all give sound performances : Mitchell excels in one of his best roles , with sturdy support from Wagner , Ross , and Jack Stuart as Karin's gallant husband Harald . Best of all , the main characters are refreshingly complicated and genuinely engaging . A fun film .
518242	8239592	68515	8.0	Likable tongue-in-cheek comedy Western	Charming , blithely amoral devil-may-care rogue Jesse Smith ( nicely played to the suavely cool hilt by Richard Harrison , who also co-directed this film ) and peaceful , devout straight-arrow Mormon Lester O'Hara ( a lively and credible performance by Donald O'Brien ) are estranged half brothers who reunite after receiving a sizable inheritance from their deceased mother . The wildly contrasting mismatched duo get into all kinds of trouble while trying to claim said inheritance . Directors Harrison and Renzo Genta relate the story at a constant quick pace , maintain a lighthearted tone throughout , and pitch the amusing lowbrow humor at a very broad , yet still enjoyable level . Moreover , the plentiful outbursts of gunplay and fisticuffs are staged with considerable aplomb , with a fierce rough'n'tumble barroom boxing match between Jesse and a hulking brute rating as a definite thrilling highlight . Harrison and O'Brien display an engagingly spiky chemistry in the leads , with sound support from Gino Maturano as ruthless one-eyed bandit gang leader Poker , Anna Zinnemann as brassy prostitute Elena Von Schaffer , George Wang as an irritable Chinese restaurant owner , and Federico Boido as wily outlaw Blondie . Carlo Savina's bouncy , jaunty score further enhances the infectiously bubbly merriment . A perfectly amiable diversion .
518080	8239592	76191	8.0	Good , cheesy , retro 50's monster-on-the-loose sci-fi / horror fun	Astronaut Steven West ( stolidly played by Alex Rebar , who subsequently quit acting to write and / or produce such dreadful , eminently disposable fright film tripe as " Demented , " " Home , Sweet Home , " " Terror on Tour , " and " To All A Good Night " ) returns from a successful Saturn mission with a mysterious degenerative skin disease which causes his skin to melt at an alarmingly accelerated rate . Steven escapes from a military hospital , ventures off into the quiet sylvan countryside , and goes on a grisly murderous spree , chowing down on an obese nurse's pudgy pus , ripping a fisherman's head off , disrupting a game of hide and seek being played by three obnoxious pot-puffing stoner kids , attacking a bickering elderly couple picking lemons late at night , assaulting a young married couple ( one of them is former " The Hills Have Eyes " cannibal clan member Janus Blythe ) in their cabin , and generally behaving like a big , nasty , butt-ugly liquefying nuisance . Hot on Steven's goopy , blood-drenched , severed limb-littered trail are true blue best buddy Dr . Ted Nelson ( the colorless Burr DeBenning ) , rigid ramrod General Michael Perry ( gruffly essayed by burly , rugged 50's B Western fixture Myron Healey ) , and earnest small-town lawman Sheriff Neil Blake ( amiable lug Michael Aldredge ) . Basically a chintzy , dopey and hokey retro 50's creature feature all sleazed and slimed up for the cheap thrill happy 70's drive-in crowd , this American International Pictures production delivers plenty of good , dumb , two-cent trashy low-budget fun . Director / writer William Sachs , who also gave us the racy teen sex comedy " Van Nuys Boulevard " and the goofy sci-fi spoof " Galaxina , " alternates between straight-faced scares and witty tongue-in-cheek buffoonery , sardonically parodying hackneyed monster movie conventions in a disarmingly affectionate manner that's gently mocking rather than smugly condescending in its flip , mordant tone . Despite Rebar's insipid performance , Steven West still makes for a strangely touching and sympathetic rampaging ghoul ; the oddly poetic shots of Steve lurching across the bright , sunny forest landscape and the remarkable sequence where he quietly contemplates his wretched , hopeless plight in an abandoned cemetery are unusually haunting and poignant , bringing a welcome dash of pathos to the titular beast that's both admirable and affecting . Rick Baker's gory , graphic , exceedingly hideous and ultra-gooey make-up f / x are every bit as gross and disgusting as they ought to be . Willy Curtis ' nifty cinematography makes especially adroit use of such always effective visual flourishes as slow motion , split screen and slow , stately fades . Arlon Ober's suitably melodramatic score , liberally laced with stinging staccato fuzz-tone guitar riffs , ain't nothing to complain about , either . Acclaimed director Jonathan Demme has a riotous bit as a leering , voyeuristic scuzzbag photographer who tries to force headstrong , strikingly gorgeous model Cheryl " Rainbeaux " Smith to take her top off . An admittedly inane , but still most enjoyable sci-fi / horror winner all around .
518442	8239592	89630	8.0	A nicely spooky and effective supernatural horror murder mystery thriller sleeper	Sensible , independent , down-to-earth young single woman Meg ( the reasonably pretty , but rather plain and refreshingly unglamorous redhead Heather Bolton ) purchases a used Jaguar Mark IV automobile that's haunted by the unrestful spirit ( expressively played to eerily mute perfection by the lovely Perry Piercy ) of the previous owner who was murdered in it . A mysterious man ( handsome , quietly menacing David Letch ) who might be the killer begins to stalk Meg . Capably directed in an effectively clean , spare , very low-key and no-frills style by Gaylene Preston , carefully scripted by Preston , Geoff Murphy and Graeme Tetley , nicely shot by Thom Burstyn and further graced with a beautifully classy and elegant orchestral score by Jonathan Crayford , this pleasingly subtle and understated supernatural horror mystery thriller weaves a highly spooky and unnerving spell on the viewer , slowly unraveling its tricky story at an admirably stately and unhurried pace while also neatly managing to avoid a standard cut'n'dried narrative trajectory . Furthermore , Preston gives the fantastic premise a semblance of believability by grounding said far-fetched tale in a plausibly banal and unremarkable evocation of grindingly drab and mundane day-to-day reality . With her spunky persona and attractively dumpy looks , Bolton makes for an extremely credible and appealing everywoman in distress . The conclusion is a genuinely harrowing white-knuckle nail-biter . A real sleeper .
517932	8239592	128451	8.0	A nicely sick and sleazy piece of low-budget Southern-fried Satanic trash	Unhappy and discontent suburban teen Bobby ( expertly played to the obnoxious hilt by Stephen White ) lives in abject misery in the Florida suburbs . He's relentlessly browbeaten by his overbearing stepfather ( a marvelously hateful Eldon Macham ) and equally nasty shamelessly flirtatious tease of an older step sister ( a perfectly bitchy Joyce Molloy ) . Fed up with all this abuse , Bobby runs away from home and winds up being savagely sodomized by a gang of greasy gay guys . The evil homosexuals leave Bobby clad solely in his underwear on the side of the road . Luckily for Bobby he's saved by a nearby Satanic cult . Attractive lady cult member Sherry ( the luscious Kathleen Archer ) gets the hots for Bobby , but cult leader Simon ( superbly essayed with mucho suavely slimy aplomb by Robert C . Ray II ) thinks Bobby is too much of a weak , passive wimp to cut it as a worthy member of the cult . So Bobby escapes from the cult's dangerous clutches ( killing four guards in the process ) and exacts a harsh revenge on his stepfather , step sister and the foul gay goons who brutally raped him in order to prove he's got the right tough stuff to qualify as a soldier in Lucifer's army . " Satan's Children " is a sensationally sick , twisted and depraved doozy of a low-budget 70's drive-in horror flick . Writer / director Joe Wiezycki relates the deranged story in a tight , snappy , straightforward manner that ensures that there's never any dreary lulls to speak of . The stark , no-frills style of the picture , best epitomized by John " Mak " Makinen's plain , grainy photography and Ray Fletcher's odd , spare , droning score , adds an immediacy to the warped proceedings that's both skin-crawlingly creepy and strangely compelling in comparable measure . The final image in this film is very scary and disturbing , concluding things on a shockingly nihilistic note that the Devil himself would approve of . Those fine freaky folks at Something Weird Video offer this hardcore ferocious piece of deviant Southern-fried sleaze on an ideal DVD double bill with William Girdler's laughably lousy debut feature " Asylum of Satan . "
518094	8239592	54668	8.0	An enjoyably bizarre Mexican sci-fi / horror oddity	1661 : Evil and unrepentant sorcerer Baron Vitelius d'Estera ( well played with suitably dour relish by Abel Salazar ) gets burned at the stake for practicing witchcraft . Before he dies the Baron vows to return 300 years later to kill the descendants of his executioners . In 1961 a passing comet resurrects the Baron as a grotesquely malformed brain-eating humanoid beast with pointy ears , a swollen face , fangs , and a long forked tongue who embarks on a brutal rampage . Capably directed by Chano Urueta , with a gloomy tone , a novel and inspired script by Federico Curiel and Adolfo Lopez Portillo , a steady pace , a lively ooga-booga shivery score by Gustavo Cesar Carrion , a gloriously hideous monster , several nifty quirky touches ( the Baron keeps the cerebrums of his victims in an urn so he can snack on them ! ) , stark , fairly polished black and white cinematography by Jose Ortiz Ramos , and solid acting from a cast that includes familiar south-of-the-border fright feature stalwarts German Robles , Luis Aragon and Ariadna Welter , this truly peculiar item makes for hugely entertaining viewing . The laughably hokey English dubbing and endearingly chintzy ( not so ) special effects only add to this picture's considerable loopy charm . A pleasingly offbeat one-of-a-kind weirdie .
518272	8239592	86014	8.0	A nifty 80's horror anthology outing	This omnibus affair offers four scary tales altogether . First and most tense story , " Terror in Topanga " - Chainsmoking housewife Lisa ( well played by the lovely Christina Raines ) finds herself being stalked by a vicious escaped psychopath when she goes out late at night for a pack of cigarettes . This vignette culminates in a positively harrowing conclusion , plus boasts neat cameos by familiar character actors Anthony James as a store clerk and William Sanderson as a gas station attendant . Second and coolest yarn , " Bishop of Battle " - Cocky whiz kid arcade rat J . J . Cooney ( a likable portrayal by Emilio Estevez ) reaches the thirteenth level of the tough video game the Bishop of Battle ( voiced with sinister aplomb by James Tolkan ) and finds himself in considerable jeopardy when the game becomes dangerously real . Several gnarly punk songs by Fear on the soundtrack and the funky special effects make this one a total blast to watch . Third and most exciting segment , " The Benediction " - The always excellent Lance Henrikson gives a typically fine and intense performance as MacLeod , a Catholic priest who loses his faith and subsequently has a frightening encounter with an evil satanic black pick-up on a lonely stretch of desert road . This absorbing " Duel " variant makes effectively eerie use of its desolate isolated setting and is highlighted by the startling sequence in which the pick-up bursts forth from the ground . Fourth and most freaky anecdote , " Night of the Rat " - A suburban family are terrorized by a huge demonic rodent that invades their home . Richard Masur and Veronica Cartwright excel as the unhappy bickering married couple , child actress Bridgette Anderson is remarkable as their sweet little girl Brooke , and Albert Hague contributes an engaging turn as folksy exterminator Mel Keefer . This story builds plenty of tension and offers a truly creepy and unsettling atmosphere that's slightly marred by some unfortunately shoddy ( not so ) special effects towards the end . Director Joseph Sargent maintains a brisk pace throughout and stages the shock scenes with commendable efficiency . Craig Safan supplies an appropriately spooky'n'shuddery score . The slick cinematography by Mario DiLeo and Gerald Perry Finnerman gives the picture a smooth glossy look . A fun fright feature .
519330	8239592	50251	8.0	An excellent and enjoyable Japanese science fiction alien invasion winner	A rural town gets completely destroyed . The military investigates and discovers a giant bird-like robot that levels everything in its lethal path . The robot belongs to the Mysterians , an alien race who want a piece of land and human women to mate with . The military refuses to comply with the aliens ' requests and declares all-out war on the Mysterians . Director Ishiro Honda , working from a compelling script by Takeshi Kimura , relates the engrossing story in a pleasingly straightforward and unpretentious manner . Moreover , Honda does a fine job of maintaining a steady pace and effectively creates a serious tone . The thrilling action set pieces and impressively prodigious sequences of mass destruction really hit the stirring spot . Akira Ifakube's robust , rousing , full-bore orchestral score , Hajime Koizuma's vibrant , expansive cinematography , and the nifty special effects are all likewise solid . The cast all contribute sound and credible performances , with especially praiseworthy work by Akihiko Hirata as diligent tragic hero Ryoichi Shiraishi and Takashi Shimura as the wise scientist Dr . Tanjiro Adachi . Essential viewing for fans of Japanese science fiction .
518135	8239592	89826	8.0	A satisfying conclusion to this hilariously raunchy series	Those rowdy sex-obsessed lads at Angel Beach High are about to graduate . They lock horns once again with their old nemesis Porky ( a perfectly nasty Chuck Mitchell ) , who wants our gang to throw a big championship basketball game and force Meat ( amiable Tony Ganios ) to marry his homely daughter Blossom ( the amusingly gawky Wendy Feign ) . Director James Tomack nicely recaptures the often uproarious sense of hysterically raucous'n'raunchy humor which made the first film such a gut-busting hoot . Better still , this movie doesn't skimp on either the riotously ribald comic set pieces or tasty female nudity : the lovely Rose McVeigh as sultry biology teacher Miss Webster engages in kinky roleplaying with a fellow teacher and gorgeous blonde babe Kim Evenson ( Playboy's September 1984 Playmate of the Month ) bares her beautiful breasts as yummy Swedish foreign exchange student Inga . Plus a bunch of guys expose their butts for the ladies . Moreover , there's a surprisingly warm and touching sweetness to be found amid all the blithely lowbrow tomfoolery . The cast all essay their parts with tremendous aplomb : Dan Monahan as the giddy Pee Wee , Kaki Hunter as the cheerfully naughty Wendy , Nancy Parsons as strict authoritarian gym teacher Ms . Balbricker , and Eric Christmas as meek principal Mr . Carter are all especially delightful . Robert C . Jessup's polished cinematography , a terrific golden oldies soundtrack , and Dave Edmunds ' catchy , vibrant score further enhance the overall solid quality of this enjoyable closing chapter in this hugely entertaining series .
518099	8239592	68425	8.0	An enjoyably dreadful piece of sci-fi schlock	An evil lethal bright orange yellow fireball comes to earth and goes on a rampage in a remote lakeside area ; the flaming thing rolls over various hapless folks and reduces them to ashes . It's up to nerdy scientist Dr . Iane Thorne ( blandly played by Marvin Howard ) to figure out a way to stop it before it's too late . Writer / director Harry Essex , who also wrote the scripts for the classic 50's fright features " It Came from Outer Space " and " The Creature from the Black Lagoon , " pukes forth a 50's style micro-budget clunker that boasts all the necessary bad movie vices to qualify as a real four-star stinker : the flat acting from a lame no-name cast ( flash-in-the-pan 70's drive-in flick starlet Maria De Aragon in particular just takes up space as fetching love interest heroine Jeanne ) , sluggish pacing , ragged editing , rough , grainy cinematography by Robert Caramico , meandering narrative , a roaring , overwrought score by Robert Freeman , several ludicrous touches ( the fireball stalks people before it kills them ! ) , and a hackneyed " it ain't over yet ! " ending all combine together to create one laughably lousy and leaden lump of a total stiff . Only Doug Deswick's surprisingly nifty special effects manage to impress . A shamefully unsung crud anti-classic .
518984	8239592	83511	9.0	Lives up to its classic reputation and then some	Scruffy maverick police detective Jack Cates ( a marvelously gritty portrayal by Nick Nolte ) springs smartaleck convict Reggie Hammond ( a bravura star-making performance by Eddie Murphy ) from jail so he can catch dangerous criminal Ganz ( a frightfully intense James Remar ) and his equally lethal partner Billy Bear ( the always imposing Sonny Landham ) within a single frantic 48 hour time period . Walter Hill's masterfully lean , mean , tautly streamlined and economical direction keeps the pace roaring along at a nonstop breakneck clip and stages the frequent stirring shoot-outs with electrifying brio . The raw , nervy , rat-a-tat-tat volatile and explosive chemistry between the gruff Nolte and the smooth Murphy delivers plenty of incendiary fireworks which are often peppered with harsh full-bore profanity and culminate in one hell of a knock-down , drag-out back alley fist fight . The now legendary sequence with Murphy terrorizing the hick patrons of a rowdy redneck honkytonk bar with his fiercely cocky and aggressive in-your-face attitude rates as another undeniable highlight . The excellent supporting cast includes Annette O'Toole as Nolte's fed-up bar maid girlfriend , David Patrick Kelly as a sniveling weasel , Denise Crosby and Greta Blackburn as hookers , Jonathan Banks as a doomed cop , Frank McRae as Nolte's huffy disapproving superior , Brion James as a fellow flatfoot , Peter Jason as a racist bartender , and Luis Contreras as a gang member . Both Ric Waite's sharp , slick , glittery cinematography and James Horner's robust , rousing score hit the spot . The great , thrilling song " The Boys Are Back in Town " by the Busboys likewise scores a bull's eye . Essential viewing .
519359	8239592	91209	9.0	An edgy and intense 80's " danger on the road " nail-biter	Sweet , naive , wet behind the ears young guy Jim Halsey ( an unexpectedly strong C . Thomas Howell , whose callow boyishness and soft passivity for once work in his favor ) is driving a friend's car from Chicago , Illinois to San Diego , California through a lonely stretch of dusty and desolate Texas backroads . Jim makes the grave mistake of giving a ride to mysterious psychotic hitchhiker John Ryder ( an impeccably icy performance by a frightfully remote and intense Rutger Hauer , who's never been more serenely chilling than he is here ) , a calmly malevolent itinerant serial killer whose attempt at adding Halsey to his ever-growing number of victims gets foiled when Halsey forcefully ejects him from his speeding car . But Ryder hasn't finished with the hapless , cowering lad . Pretty soon poor Jim has been incriminated in a series of gruesome murders that were committed by Ryder , who obviously wants the boy to overcome his wimpiness and work up the necessary guts to take him out for reasons which are hinted at , but never completely explained ( subconcious guilt ? seething repressed homosexual lust ? a desire to call it quits and have someone else assume the role you played in life ? The possibilities are endless ) . Naturally , the cops are useless and only token nice gal waitress Jennifer Jason Leigh tries to help out , but winds up meeting an especially nasty end . Director Robert Harmon milks the harsh , upsetting and nihilistic implications of Eric Red's slyly open-ended and allegorical script for all they're worth , creating a potently tense , brooding , oddly surreal nightmarish atmosphere that's both engrossingly twisted and deliciously oblique , staging several breathtaking car chases with consummate skill ( extra props are in order here for John Seale's stunning cinematography and Mark Isham's moody , low-key score ) , never holding back on the unsparingly gruesome violence ( watch out for the infamous severed-fingers-in - - the-French-fries scene ! ) , and slowly , but surely erasing the fine line between good and evil , right and wrong , decency and indecency , even purity and wickedness as the film races towards its shatteringly vague conclusion which refuses to firmly state whether Halsey has either been irredeemably corrupted or considerably strengthened by his hair-raising , soul-crushing , will-testing brush with death . An absolute powerhouse .
517982	8239592	141105	9.0	A really hip , charming and flat-out hilarious riot	Feckless , laid-back and amiable Robert ( the very likable Rafer Weigel ) and his sarcastic , more grouchy and irritable best buddy Mark ( the equally engaging Eric McCormack ) are a couple of hardcore " Star Trek " fans who are both facing their 30th birthdays and the subsequent sense of maturity and responsibility turning 30 entails . Robert and Mark meet their longtime idol William Shatner , who turns out to be a complete flaky and pompous windbag . Moreover , Robert encounters and falls in love with spunky and luscious fellow science fiction buff Claire ( the adorable Audie England ) . Director Robert Meyer Burnett , working from a bright , witty and inspired script he co-wrote with Mark A . Altman , whips up a highly charming , amusing and utterly delightful treat that's rife with knowing pop culture references ( the " Logan's Run " gag is especially funny ) , snappy dialogue , and a lively , carefree , uplifting tone . Weigel and McCormack share a loose and appealing chemistry which makes the friendship between Robert and Mark both touching and credible . Shatner is an absolute hoot as he sends himself up with lip-smacking aplomb : Bill is first seen in a book store checking out a dirty magazine , gets slabbed in the face when he drunkenly attempts to pick up the fetching Marlena ( Deborah Van Valkenburgh of " The Warriors " ) in a bar , and heartily belts out the funky rap tune " No Tears for Caesar " at Mark's gala 30th birthday bash . Nice supporting performances by Patrick Van Horn as the smooth , yet smarmy ladies ' man Sean , Phil LaMarr as the moody Eric , Jonathan Slavin as the hopelessly geeky Dan , and Lori Lively as ravishing redhead Leila . Scott Spock's bubbly , frothy , catchy lounge score hits the spot . Charles L . Barbee's polished , sparkling cinematography likewise does the trick . Some of the picture's best and most gut-busting jokes appear in the sidesplitting ending credits . A total blast .
518564	8239592	66418	9.0	The first and best of the 70's nurse movies	Four lovely young nurses in their last year of nursing school experience all kinds of turmoil and excitement in their lives : sweet Susan ( winsome brunette Elaine Giftos ) tries to comfort the bitter , terminally ill Greg ( a moving performance by Darrell Larson ) , eager , but neurotic Phred ( lovely blonde Karen Carlson ) romances handsome gynecologist Jim Caspar ( affable Lawrence Casey ) , free-spirited hippie Priscilla ( the stunningly gorgeous Barbara Leigh ) gets impregnated by laid-back drug dealer Les ( the solid Richard Rust ) , and compassionate Lynn ( nicely played by Brioni Farrell ) helps out angry Mexican revolutionary Victor Charlie ( the excellent Reni Santoni ) . Despite the fact that this film was made for Roger Corman's legendary exploitation outfit New World Pictures , it's anything but your standard mindless piece of leering soft-core schlock . Instead , it's a very pleasant , charming and even often thoughtful time capsule of the social and political upheavals of the groovy early 70's ( the subplot involving Lynn and the revolutionaries is especially potent and provocative ) . Special kudos are in order for director Stephanie Rothman , who brings a welcome and refreshing intelligence and sensitivity to the material . Moreover , the four attractive and appealing female leads all turn in sound and praiseworthy work . Scottie MacGregor likewise impresses as wise supervisor Ms . Boswell and ubiquitous 70's trailer voice guy Ronald Gans supplies the off-screen voice of a psychiatrist . Stevan Larner's polished cinematography , the fantastic rock soundtrack , and the flavorsome folksy'n'funky score by Clancy B . Grass III are all up to speed . A real sleeper .
518563	8239592	105275	9.0	A potent and startling depiction of angry disaffected youth	A gang of savage skinheads led by the ruthless and charismatic Hando ( a mesmerizing portrayal by Russell Crowe in his star-making role ) battle Korean immigrants who are moving into their suburban Melbourne neighborhood . Things go sour when the Koreans outnumber the skinheads and kill off most of their number . Further complications are caused by troubled , spacey epileptic junkie Gabe ( superbly played by the fetching Jacqueline McKenzie ) , who comes between Hando and his loyal best mate Davey ( the excellent Daniel Pollock ) . Writer / director Geoffrey Wright's dazzling debut feature seethes with a ferocious and unrelenting ultra-kinetic buzz that works over the viewer like a severe jackboot beat-down : the frantic pace , in-your-face brutal and unflinching outbursts of hideous violence , stark nihilism , and uncompromisingly downbeat conclusion all add up to one profoundly unsettling , yet undeniably gripping and sometimes occasionally poignant viewing experience . Wright wisely doesn't preach ; instead he allows the grim story and no-hoper characters to make the pertinent point that hatred and violence are an end to themselves rather than a means to an end . Moreover , Wright exposes the fear , rage , paranoia , and stupidity that fuels racism with a hard , unblinking clarity that's disturbing and provocative in equal measure . In addition , the performances are uniformly outstanding : While Crowe clearly dominates the picture with his forceful turn as Hando , Pollock , McKenzie , Alex Scott as Gabe's incestuous rich father Martin , Leigh Russell as the bitter Sonny Jim , and James McKenna as scrappy little boy Bubs are all just as strong and impressive . Ron Hagen's striking , dynamic cinematography , the terrific thrashy punk soundtrack , and John Clifford White's jangly , rattling score are all fine and effective . An absolute powerhouse .
519040	8239592	175536	9.0	An absolutely astonishing piece of gleefully demented & degenerate filth	Any film which toplines a teenage bulimic drug addict prostitute criminal sociopath who when she isn't indulging in scarf'n'barf eating binges habitually robs her johns so she can eke out a sordidly meager existence as its anti-heroine is unarguably pushing the limits of good taste and restraint to the breaking point . Well , this shockingly base and savage exploitation stunner not only graphically depicts various acts of all-out depravity in unsparingly explicit detail , but also wallows in a festering sinkhole of unremittingly foul no-holds-barred cinematic scuzziness with a certain lip-smacking fiendish glee . When underage hooker White Girl ( the luscious Natasha Lyonne ) meets deranged lesbian sexual psychopath serial killer Cyclona ( galvanizing spitfire Maria Celedonio ) in a brutal juvenile detention center , it's clear right from the start that they are a match made in bad girl hell . Pretty soon the dangerously nutso twosome escape and go on the lam , embarking on a mondo berserko crime spree as they travel cross country to Tijuana , Mexico , where they believe both sanctuary and possible redemption awaits them in the form of demented pedophile cannibal transvestite kiddie-porn making nun ( ! ) Sister Gomez ( an amazingly wacked portrayal by " Buffalo ' 66 " auteur Vincent Gallo ) . Powered along by a pair of laudably fearless , anything-goes , let-it-all-hang-out dynamic and uninhibited performances by Lyonne and Celedonio , loaded to the grimy gills with nonstop seedy thrills , strikingly ferocious violence , and carnal perversions of every conceivable stripe , and rounding things off with a gruesomely over-the-top nasty conclusion that's sure to knock the air out of your lungs , this thoroughly warped and electrifying crime / chase / chicks-in-chains sleaze film take on the classic Grimm Brothers fairytale " Hansel and Gretel " will either delight you with its impressively shameless and aggressive assault-on-your-senses agenda or offend you to the ninth degree for the very same reason . Before you ask precisely which side of the fence I'm on with this particular flick , let me state for the record that any picture which features nifty cameos by John Landis as a hard-nosed judge , David Alan Grier as a scummy sex-crazed shyster lawyer , and " Drugstore Cowboy " ' s Max Perlich as a slacker drunk , numerous acts of vicious murder , masturbation , full-frontal shower room nudity , projectile puking by the literal gallon , necrophilia , spray paint-huffing , and a funky , rollicking trashy score that's in equal parts digging rap and ripping surf-rock will always get my vote .
518778	8239592	56983	9.0	Francis Ford Coppola's superbly creepy & atmospheric horror gem	After helming a few thoroughly fluffy and disposable nudie cuties in the early 60's Francis Ford Coppola made his legitimate commercial feature debut by writing and directing this moodily Gothic horror mystery thriller under the sage aegis of irrefutable legendary exploitation movie ace Roger Corman , with Jack Hill handling second unit production chores . After her husband suddenly dies of a heart attack , greedy , scheming , venomous femme fatale Luana Anders goes to hubby's moldy old isolated lakeside castle family estate in Ireland to convince her batty , domineering mother-in-law to give her a huge chunk of the inheritance . Unfortunately , a murderous member of the wacko dysfunctional and superstitious clan starts to bump folks off with an axe . Late , great , arrestingly off-beat and unconventionally beautiful cult actress Anders shines in a rare substantial lead role while the always excellent Patrick Magee contributes a lively performance as an astute , sharp-tongued doctor . Handsomely photographed in crisp black and white by Charles Hanawalt , scored to exquisitely lush and brooding orchestral perfection by prolific AIP in-house composer Ronald Stein , further graced by a genuinely flesh-crawling spooky atmosphere and highlighted by several deftly executed murder set pieces ( the scene where an underwear-clad Anders gets her brutal just desserts after taking a midnight swim is both truly sexy and shockingly nasty ) , this marvelously eerie and effective little low-budget beaut stands tall as a sterling early testament to Coppola's significant cinematic prowess .
518874	8239592	44789	9.0	A terrifically tense , tough & thrilling 50's crime noir classic	Bitter ex-cop Tim Foster ( expertly played with consummate steely resolve by Preston Foster ) is still fuming about his forced early retirement , so he decides to get his revenge by devising a fiendishly clever perfect caper . Foster forces three despicable low-life hoodlums - - jittery compulsive gambler Pete Harris ( lanky Jack Elam ) , sleazy womanizing heel Tony Romano ( snaky Lee Van Cleef ) and surly gum-chewing brute Boyd Kane ( burly Neville Brand ) - - to pull off a bold $1 , 200 , 000 bank heist . Foster cruelly sets up rugged , resourceful and resilient innocent ex-con Joe Rolfe ( a strong and sympathetic performance by John Payne ) as a fall guy in a wicked ploy to buy time to successfully escape the country with the hot loot . After he gets sprung from jail due to lack of evidence , Joe puts himself in considerable jeopardy by obsessively tracking down Foster and his pernicious flunkies in order to clear his name . Phil Karlson's sharp , assured and stylish direction , working from a smart , complex and absorbing script by George Bruce and Harry Essex , further aided by George E . Diskant's stark , shadowy black and white photography and Paul Santell's brooding , moody , rousing score , skillfully crafts a diabolically arresting and hard-boiled little nugget of a gritty crime noir thriller : the brisk pace never lets up for a minute , the nerve-wracking suspense is well-maintained from start to finish , the tone is suitably grim and serious , and the tense , bleak , seedy and sinister atmosphere seethes with danger and corruption . The film's principal winning hand is the truly inspired and on the money casting of resolutely scrappy and unglamorous character actors Elam , Brand and Van Cleef as three of the foulest , meanest , ugliest and most menacing no-account criminal scum to ever scowl , growl and glower their way across the screen ; Brand and Van Cleef in particular make for a fabulously nasty and odious pair of scary customers . Colleen Gray adds substantial spunky charm and vigor as a feisty aspiring lady lawyer who befriends Joe . Slightly marred by a rather sappy conclusion , " Kansas City Confidential " overall still rates highly as the authentic gnarly noir article .
518729	8239592	71222	9.0	A splendidly scary & spooky 70's seasonal slasher landmark	Made a good four years prior to John Carpenter's phenomenally hair-raising terror movie watershed " Halloween , " this superbly scary and suspenseful ahead-of-its-time seasonal slasher trailblazer laid the basic groundwork for the countless similarly plotted holiday-themed horror entries which followed in its influential wake throughout the late 70's and up until the mid 80's . The then fresh and novel , now stale and generic premise centers on a frightfully maniacal cackling lunatic who escapes from an asylum and holes up in the dusty attic of a nearby college sorority house on December 24th . At first the babbling , profanity-screaming nutjob taunts the sorority girls with disturbing obscene phone calls before proceeding to pick off the hapless lasses one at a time . Eventually a token lovely coed ( sympathetically played by the astonishingly gorgeous Olivia Hussey ) has to face the murderous kook on her own ( said only lady left heroine is called in slasher movie parlance " the final girl , " which later became a huge cliché in subsequent slice'n'dice features ) . Director Benjamin " Bob " Clark , who had previously helmed the superior zombie pictures " Deathdream " and " Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things " ( Clark's latter efforts include the first two uproariously raunchy " Porky's " films and , amazingly enough , the disarmingly sweet yuletide treat " A Christmas Story " ! ) masterfully creates and sustains a genuinely eerie and nerve-jangling atmosphere while establishing such standard body count movie components as hand-held subjective camera shots of the killer on the prowl , bravura murder set pieces ( suffocation with plastic bag , impalement on hook , and , in the single most stunning kill scene , a comely honey being stabbed to death with a crystal unicorn ornament that's brilliantly inter-cut with an angelic children's choir singing " Sleep in Heavenly Peace " with positively haunting and harrowing results ) , a creepy mystery wacko whose true identity is never revealed , a few red herring secondary characters ( notably Keir Dullea as Hussey's neurotic , violently temperamental pianist boyfriend ) , a riveting last reel showdown with a brave and resourceful heroine asserting her proto-feminist strength and independence by doing in the killer all by her lonesome , and a socko surprise ending . Cleverly written by Ray Moore , the neatly twisty script further adds several riotous dollops of bawdy humor to leaven the unnerving tension and an intelligent reason why the initial murder victims aren't immediately missed ( they left early for the holidays ) . Reginald Morris ' strikingly crisp and agile cinematography vividly captures the stark bleakness of the severely cold wintry landscape , thereby greatly enhancing the overall literally and figuratively chilling mood . The cast all turn in bang-up performances : Margot Kidder vamps it up hilariously as a hysterically brash and slutty tramp , Marion Waldman likewise amuses as the outrageously vulgar den mother , John Saxon is properly stalwart in the first of many concerned police chief parts ( a role he reprised to perfection in " A Nightmare on Elm Street " ) , " The Brood " ' s Art Hindle lurks around the edges as a hunky frat boy , David Cronenberg regular Art ( " Videodrome , " " The Fly " ) Hindle pops up as a helpful cop , Doug McGrath supplies side-splitting comic relief as a geeky desk sergeant , and a pre - " SCTV " Andrea Martin is engaging as a mousy sorority sister . Smart , absorbing and above all profoundly frightening , " Black Christmas " will most assuredly give you the willies any old time of the year .
517961	8239592	300451	9.0	A very charming , funny and refreshingly offbeat Bigfoot documentary hoot	Without a doubt one of the best refreshingly atypical Bigfoot documentaries to ever grace celluloid , this winningly whimsical , but still respectful and illuminating made-for-Canadian TV 70 minute feature breaks from the standard mold by not focusing solely on Sasquatch . Instead , director / co-screenwriter Peter von Puttkamer offers a wryly amusing and highly entertaining profile on four fellows who've dedicated their lives to the study , capture and documentation of the legendary apeman's existence . Affectionately dubbed " The Four Horsemen of Sasquatchery , " the motley quartet of elderly gents are : Studiously academic physical anthropologist Grover Krantz , suave Irish adventurer Peter Byrne , shy , soft-spoken outdoorsman Peter Green , and crotchety Swiss writer Rene Dahinden . Puttkamer's colorful portraits of these reigning Sasquatch experts offers a telling and enjoyable glimpse at the uniquely obsessive mindset of the dyed-in-the-wool Bigfoot fanatic . Krantz , who was initially a skeptic when he first became seriously involved with investigating Sasquatch and has been fiercely ridiculed for his firm belief in Bigfoot and deemed a pariah within the snobby scientific community which in turn has made him extremely hidebound , hardened and tenacious with the passage of time , qualifies as the most scholarly and professorial of Bigfoot buffs thanks to his strong theories concerning Mr . Over-sized Pawprint's prehistoric origins . The immaculately cultured , composed and extroverted bon vivant Byrne rates as the Errol Flynn of the bunch , while the quiet and reserved Green comes across as the average garden variety everyman who somehow got tangled up in some incredibly nutty business-type of affable guy of the group . And then there's the lovably cantankerous Dahinden , whose salty tongue , easily set off temper , and zero tolerance for snot-nosed amateurs and stuffy bookworm facts single him out as the king crabby curmudgeon of Sasquatch trackers ( Dahinden is further blessed with an impish sense of humor , as proved by a TV commercial he did for Kokanee beer featuring Bigfoot . Kokanee did several other ads with Bigfoot in ' em . And , yes Virginia , there's indeed a brew called Bigfoot Beer ! ) . Of course , these geriatric men are all former close friends turned bitter adversaries who constantly argue over such pressing issues as whether Bigfoot is a man or an ape , Bigfoot's debatable status as the possible missing link , and whether it's preferable to capture a Sasquatch dead or alive . Graced with the terrific country-and-western novelty theme song " Bigfoot Lives " and choice clips from trashy two-bit Sasquatch exploitation pictures ( which include Bill Rebane's delectably cheesy " The Capture of Bigfoot " ! ) , this wonderful picture rates as a pleasingly quirky and frivolous addition to the usually gravely sober Bigfoot documentary branch of the Sasquatch cinema tree .
518299	8239592	56142	9.0	The Big G and the Great Ape really mix it up in this immensely enjoyable beastbash	A submarine bumps into the iceberg Godzilla was sleeping in and wakes the ferocious behemoth up . Naturally , Godzilla is mighty cranky and makes an immediate beeline to Japan so he can level the countryside . Meanwhile , King Kong gets discovered on a remote tropical island by two goofy adventurers and likewise gets transported back to Japan as well . Our towering monster duo hook up in Tokyo for a wild , savage , no-holds-barred paw-to-claw thingo-a-thingo duel of the titans smackdown showdown where they proceed to really dance a brutal boogie . They throw boulders at each other . Godzilla burns King Kong with his lethal radioactive breath . They grapple and tumble like a pair of gigantic deranged wrestlers all hopped up on steroids . The undeniable highlight occurs when King Kong picks Godzilla up by his tail and whips him around the air like a huge ragdoll . Better still , King Kong also fights a big slimy octopus and both beasts trash trains . This immensely enjoyable creature feature item possesses all the delectably cheesy ingredients that I absolutely adore in these kinds of sublimely silly monster movies : hilariously horrible dubbing , lovably shoddy rinky-dink ( far from ) special effects , a booming , bombastic score , dopey dialogue ( " King Kong can't make a monkey out of us " ) , exquisitely expansive widescreen cinematography , engagingly dumb human characters , and our two colossal creatures are obviously played by a couple of guys in endearingly crummy and unconvincing rubber suits . The excitable and hyperactive five year old boy inside of me thoroughly digs this delightfully dunced-out doozy - - and always will no matter how old I get .
518553	8239592	72594	9.0	A wonderfully wacky and idiosyncratic one-of-a-kind seriocomic hoot	Brash , eager young turk Peter Fonda , the wayward scion of a wealthy family , comes back to his sleepy Key West , Florida home town and decides to become a river boat fishing guide , which ignites a bitter feud between Fonda and two fiercely independent , self-made working class fellow guides - - cantankerous , ferocious near crazy Warren Oates and his laid-back , but fretful buddy Harry Dean Stanton - - over some choice section of fish-infected water . An authentically wiggy , amiable , frothy , if somewhat erratic character-based study of the classic rivalry between the bratty , lazy new generation and the crusty , hidebound old guard who automatically feel threatened by any hotshot young competition with an incisive grounding in the rigid parameters separating the hoity-toity , overconfident upper class from scruffy , fidgety blue collar folks , " 92 in the Shade " makes for a disarmingly quirky seriocomic delight . Acclaimed novelist Tom McGuane's presentation of the nutty , enrapturing , intriguingly off-beat narrative tends to be pretty clumsy and unsteady , but there's a catchy , idiosyncratic , nicely relaxed rhythm to the eccentric proceedings which neatly ingratiates itself upon the viewer . Moreover , the sharply observed characters are an amusing , enjoyable , entertaining bunch of cranky , obstinate kooks , the dialogue is often riotous ( " Take your hat off , will ya ? Let your brains cool off - - you're thinking too hard ! " ) , Michael C . Butler's bright , eye-catching cinematography gives the movie an attractive sparkling look , Michael J . Lewis supplies a pleasingly bluesy'n'woozy score , and there are plenty of hilariously wacky moments featured throughout . The terrific cast includes Margot Kidder as Fonda's flaky , flighty school teacher girlfriend , Burgess Meredith as Fonda's crotchety , foul-mouthed rich grandfather , Elizabeth Ashley as Stanton's pregnant , terminally out to lunch wife ( she has this annoying tendency to dress up as a cheerleader and do baton twirls in front of total strangers ) , William Hickey as Fonda's sickly , gloomy failure of a dad , Sylvia Miles as Meredith's loopy , sardonic secretary , Louise Lathom as Fonda's bored mother , and , in an uncharacteristically goofy role , a surprisingly uproarious Joe Spinell as Ollie Slatt , an insufferably smug and seriously obtuse businessman who professes to be a devout sportsman , but knows positively nothing about fishing . Fonda , Stanton and especially Oates in particular give funny , engaging , top-drawer performances . Although a bit rough around the edges , " 92 in the Shade " generally succeeds with its keen depiction of everyday oddballs who are constantly at loggerheads with each other and overall rates as a leisurely paced , wryly humorous one-of-a-kind charmer .
518655	8239592	85846	9.0	An excellent & unjustly neglected Hitchcockian thriller gem	Forever under-acclaimed slender , green-eyed , button cute blonde actress Annn Dusenberry , who got terrorized by Bruce the mechanical shark in " Jaws 2 , " gives a typically animated , engaging and on the money performance as Robyn Wallace , a sweet , struggling , down on her luck actress who's having a tremendously hard time snagging that frustratingly elusive big breakthrough part . Robyn's heretofore rotten luck changes for the better when independent film producer Gail Strickland hires her to play an insane , institutionalized wealthy heiress in a movie . The flick abruptly folds after one day's worth of shooting . Robyn finds out from the wealthy heiress ' faithful , despondent husband ( marvelously portrayed by the always super Bruce Davison ) that the woman she played in the film is still alive ( Robyn was told she was dead ) and that she has inadvertently become seriously involved in an intricate and diabolical plot to acquire the heiress ' considerable inheritance . Cleverly written and sharply directed by the constantly up to snuff Jim and Ken Wheat ( the same brotherly film-making duo who later gave us the bang-up horror anthology winner " After Midnight , " plus co-wrote the scripts for both the superior slasher item " Silent Scream " and the terrific sci-fi / horror dilly " Pitch-Black " ) , further enhanced by Robert Erbinger's crisply proficient cinematography , Marc Donahue's effectively spooky'n'shuddery synthesizer score , and a bracingly bravura hanging an in elevator shaft murder set piece , this deliciously convoluted and thoroughly absorbing nerve-rattling corker really makes the grade as a smartly crafted and adroitly executed Hitchcockian suspense thriller . Dusenberry simply shines in an all-too-rare substantial lead , receiving excellent support from Clu Gulager as a sinister , manipulative psychiatrist , Terence Knox as Robyn's earnest , supportive screenwriter boyfriend , Bert Remsen as Robyn's nice , gregarious agent , and the ubiquitous Dick Miller as a sleazeball B-pic producer who fires Robyn on the set of his latest crassly exploitative schlocky zombie fright feature when she refuses to show some skin ( " Money honey , " Miller growls to Robyn after she asks him why she should disrobe on screen , " Ts sell tickets ! " ) . Compelling , exciting and briskly paced , this enormously entertaining and underrated overlooked little sleeper is well worth seeing and hugely worthy of rediscovery .
518822	8239592	80025	9.0	A delightfully clever and inspired time travel science fiction thriller pip	1893 . Victorian era London , England . Brilliant , but idealistic writer and scientist H . G . Wells ( a wonderfully warm and engaging performance by Malcolm McDowell ) invents a time machine . Notorious psychopath Jack the Ripper ( superbly played with subdued menace by David Warner ) uses the time machine to travel to San Francisco , California in 1979 . Wells follows after him . While searching for the Ripper Wells meets and falls in love with sunny and liberated bank worker Amy Robbins ( a fabulously sweet and endearing portrayal by Mary Steenburgen ) . Writer / director Nicholas Meyer deftly blends elements of comedy , romance , thriller , and science fiction into a fresh , witty and entertaining mix that moves along at a brisk pace , delivers a substantial amount of suspense and excitement , and radiates an utterly beguiling whimsical charm throughout . Moreover , Meyer offers plenty of pointed social commentary on the harsh violence and pervasive decadence of the modern age and milks the fish out of water premise for all its worth as Wells figures out how to order fast food at McDonald's and learns how to drive a car and operate an electric toothbrush . This movie further benefits from uniformly excellent acting from a top-drawer cast : McDowell and Steenburgen display a truly enchanting screen chemistry ( not surprisingly , they were married for a short spell after appearing together in this film ) , Warner makes for a positively chilling Jack the Ripper , Charles Cioffi acquits himself well in a sizable supporting role as the disbelieving Police Lieutenant Mitchell , and Patti D'Arbanville contributes a wonderfully lively bit as perky Jack the Ripper victim Shirley . Miklos Rozsa supplies a perfectly lush , robust and stirring score . Paul Lohmann's crisp cinematography likewise hits the bull's eye . A total treat .
519288	8239592	78326	10.0	Superbly gritty 70's crime drama with a first-rate Dustin Hoffman performance	Dustin Hoffman gives one of his finest , scrappiest and least sappy performances as Max Dembo , a cagey , scuzzy , ferociously self-reliant sociopathic ex-con who gets sprung from the joint and makes a game , albeit futile attempt at going legit , only to wind up resorting to his old criminal ways after his browbeating , grossly unfair and overzealous parole officer ( a superbly slimy M . Emmet Walsh ) fouls up his chances at becoming a decent , law-abiding citizen with some trumped-up bullst drug charge . Under Ulu Grosbard's tight , no-frills , naturalistic direction , this marvelously gritty and hard-hitting semi-verite crime drama makes for a terrifically tough-minded adaptation of real-life reformed hoodlum Edward Bunker's exceptional semi-autobiographical novel " No Beast So Fierce " ( Bunker co-wrote the rough , resolutely unromantic no-nonsense script and has a funny bit part as one of Max's connected underworld pals ) as well as a savagely trenchant indictment of our society's cruelly ineffectual prison reformation system and a provocative meditation on the struggle for redemption . The supporting cast makes the grade with flying colors : the gorgeous Theresa Russell as a guileless , but headstrong welfare worker who gets more than she bargained for when she hooks up with Max ; Gary Busey as a deplorably craven , heroin-addicted wheelman with a backbone of jello , a then unknown Kathy Bates as Busey's loving wife , and , best of all , the ever-awesome Harry Dean Stanton as an uncomfortably mellowed-out erstwhile jailbird who gladly chucks away his hideously banal suburbanite existence in order to embark on an exciting robbing spree with Max . Further strengthened by David Shire's sprightly blues score , Owen Roizman's agile , but scruffy cinematography , a suitably harsh and unglamorous depiction of brutish low-life crooks and the grimy , seedy , and dangerous down'n'dirty milieu they inhibit , a lively , adrenaline-pumping jewelry store heist sequence , and a rigorously grim , downbeat , unsentimental tone that stays bleakly true to itself to the literal bitter end , this extremely powerful knock-out undeservedly tanked at the box office , but has rightfully amassed a sizable cult following which correctly proclaims it as one of the single most remarkable and shamefully underrated sleepers from the 70's .
517976	8239592	95560	10.0	A hilariously horrible blatant " ET " rip-off	A family of hideously homely aliens find themselves stuck on Earth . The family gets separated . One little boy alien named Mac ( an acronym for Mysterious Alien Creature ) befriends plucky crippled kid Eric ( winningly played by real-life disabled kid Jade Calegory ) . Eric helps Mac get reunited with his family . Co-written and directed with staggering ineptitude by Stewart Raffill , with a syrupy , swelling ersatz John Williams orchestral mush score by Alan Silvestri , plenty of shameless product plugs for the fast food chain McDonald's ( Ronald McDonald even makes a highly unwelcome cameo appearance ! ) , a soundtrack full of dreadful power pop ballads , cruddy ( far from ) special effects , and loads of unintentional belly laughs , this awesomely atrocious abomination rates as a total four-star so - stinky - it's - strangely - sublime schlocky hoot . The cast turn in astoundingly awful performances : Jonathan Ward as Eric's jerky , obnoxious tool of an older brother Michael , Christine Ebersole as Eric's harried mother Janet , Katrina Caspary as hot teenage brunette Courtney , Lauren Stanley as spunky little girl Debbie , and George " Buck " Flower as a bumbling supermarket security guard . The aliens are truly freaky-looking buggers : With their shriveled-up prune faces , big , wide , googly saucer eyes , spindly limbs , bony builds , pot bellies , and wobbly walks , they are more creepy and ugly than cute and cuddly . Gut-busting highlights include Mac being fried by an electric fence , Eric rolling down a cliff and crashing into a lake , Debbie getting strapped to the back of an out of control vacuum cleaner , Eric racing through a street and a shopping center with Mac on his lap , and the jaw-dropping protracted dance party sequence at a McDonald's restaurant with Mac in a teddy bear outfit cutting loose with these pathetic herky-jerky rug-tearin ' moves . A gloriously ghastly camp marvel of charmingly horrendous 80's kitsch .
518804	8239592	56703	10.0	A simply spectacular motion picture	Late , great crazy creepo character actor extraordinaire Timothy Carey really outdoes himself with this wonderfully warped crackpot classic . Carey wrote , produced , directed , distributed , plays the lead , and even sings and dances in this positively insane knockout about Clarence Hilliard , a fortyish insurance salesman who up and quits his dreary dead end job so he can start life afresh by denouncing God and preaching a blasphemous alternate religion where every person can not only have eternal life , but also become a god in their own right and live life however they please . Assisted by loyal Mexicon gardener Alonzo ( ripely played by Ray Dennis Steckler movie regular Titus Moode ) , Clarance , now calling himself God Hilliard , sporting a fake pasted on goatee , and clad in a gleaming gold lame suit , first wins over the masses by singing his unholy word while backed up by a hideously sludgy , tuneless and off-key band and doing these hilariously arrhythmic herky-jerky Elvis-style gyrating pelvis moves while performing on stage . Then Clarence goes an extra step further off the deep end by creating the Eternal Man's Party and running for president . Clarence incites riots ( " We are all gods ! , " the crowd exclaims as they demolish cars , buildings and park benches ) , beds countless female followers ( who include an elderly woman and a 14-year-old girl ! ) , advises weak , doubting nonbelievers to commit suicide , neglects his loving wife and kids , gets condemned in the press as an atheist , and dares the Supreme Being to produce some tangible , irrefutable evidence that confirms his very existence . Carey's raving , impassioned , amazingly manic'n'frantic fruitbag performance , ably supported by the frenetic whirlwind pace , crude , disjointed narrative , grainy , washed-out black and white photography , Frank Zappa's overwrought full orchestral score , nutty dialogue , hip opening credits rockabilly theme song set to a socking diddy bop beat , choppy editing , the plummy , dulcet baritone of Paul Frees as the voice of Satan ( personified here as a snake ) , and general air of gloriously gonzo abandon , sets this stupendously sordid and sacrilegious stunner right over the edge , boldly ( and gleefully ) defying any remote semblance of either good taste or proper social restraint . A simply astonishing picture .
518932	8239592	70222	10.0	A truly terrific , nicely naughty and often uproarious 70's sci-fi / horror sexploitation hoot	This gloriously gaga piece of prime drive-in sci-fi / horror sexploitation junk could have only been made in the 70's . It's a wonderfully raunchy and raucous romp about a deadly strain of sexually insatiable and incredibly desirable mutant young woman who cause men to have fatal massive heart attacks while engaging in strenuous coitus with them ! It's up to stalwart FBI agent Neil Agar ( the almighty William Smith in peak rugged and charming form ) to thwart the luscious ladies . He's assisted by the prim , yet still attractive Julie Zorn ( delectable blonde bombshell and " Playboy " Playmate Victoria Vetri of " When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth " fame ) . Director Dennis Sanders has a ball with Nicholas Meyer's wicked witty and wacky tongue-in-cheek script ; he expertly maintains a constant snappy pace , elicits lively and appealing performances from a game cast , and keeps the humor suitably naughty and lowbrow throughout . Both Gary Graver's snazzy photography and Charles Bernstein's groovy score further add to the immensely outrageous fun . But it's the downright delicious cast of gorgeous gals who portray the titular lethal lovelies who make this film such a terrifically trashy treat : Sultry brunette knockout and original " The Price Is Right " game show model Anitra Ford seriously sizzles as the scientist who's behind the whole nutty nefarious plot while such similarly smoking hot soft-core starlets as Rene Bond , Sharon Kelly and Beverly Powers strut their scorching stuff as fellow beautiful bee babes . Plus there's fun supporting performances by Cliff Osmond as the puzzled police captain , Ben Hammer as a bored research scientist who's eager to cheat on his wife ( Ford's fireside seduction of Hammer is genuinely steamy ) , " The Worm Eaters " writer / director Herb Robbins as a local trouble-making redneck , and Cliff Emmich as a sarcastic coroner . Moreover , the gratuitous nudity is quite plentiful , the sex scenes are very arousing , and the blithely silly tone proves to be positively infectious . A fabulously flaky 70's cult classic that's essential viewing for devout aficionados of terminally offbeat low-budget schlock cinema .
518236	8239592	96149	10.0	A hilariously horrendous hunk of clunky low-budget sci-fi junk	The peace and serenity of the spaceship Southern Sun gets rudely disrupted by a nasty gang of mutineers led by the evil Flight Commander Elijah Kalgan ( an outrageously hammy portrayal by a constantly scowling John Phillip Law ) . It's up to mighty macho man supreme Dave Ryder ( beefy hunk Reb Brown , who displays all the charisma of a can of spoiled Spam ) to stop Kalgan before it's too late . Poorly directed with jaw-dropping ineptitude by David Winters , further blessed with dreadful acting , rusty tin-eared dialogue ( sample line : " Surrender or be blown into astro dust ! " ) , copious special effects footage lifted from " Battlestar Galactica , " badly staged action scenes ( a protracted chase sequence involving a couple of souped-up futuristic golf carts is especially sidesplitting ) , laughable costumes , tacky opening titles , cheesy ( markedly less than ) special effects , crummy sets ( the spaceship cargo bay looks just like a rundown old oil refinery - - and probably was exactly that ! ) , and the insanely cool-rockin ' ending credits theme song " The Edge of A Dream , " this gloriously ghastly marvel of all-out celluloid awfulness is an uproariously atrocious riot from stinky start to fumbling finish . The uniformly abysmal performances from the Hall of Shame Faded ( Semi ) Name cast provides a lion's share of the unintentional hilarity : Brown projects all the appeal of a smelly plastic bag full of fresh cow excrement , Law cuts loose with the same irritating psycho cackle with appalling regularity , Cameron Mitchell sports a ridiculously fake-looking Santa Claus-style snowy white beard as the wise , gentle Commander Alex Jansen , martial arts movie star James Ryan terribly overacts as the hateful and traitorous cripple MacPhearson , and Graham Clarke sleepwalks through his part as the stolid Captain Scott Devers . Moreover , Cisse Cameron as the spunky Dr . Lea Jansen sure looks cute and steams up the screen with her remarkably sexy hula hoop disco dance . Plus a bunch of yummy psychic alien babes help our heroes out . An absolute cruddy hoot .
519303	8239592	303361	10.0	The insanity of loneliness	" May " is the kind of film which quietly sneaks up on you , lulls you into a lazy trance and then knocks you flat on your butt when you least expect it , pulling the rug out from under you with a deceptive ease and subtlety that's a true breath-taking wonder to behold . It's the extremely sad , funny and ultimately terrifying in-depth you-are-there intimate and observant portrait of one May ( a simply spectacular performance of exceptional nuance and ability by the remarkable Angela Bettis ) , a painfully shy and awkward social misfit who works as a veterinarian's assistant at a local animal hospital and lives by herself in a tidy little apartment with only a creepy china doll that's kept locked up in a box as her sole friend . Things perk up for the heretofore miserable May when she meets and befriends Adam ( winningly played by the handsome and charming Jeremy Sisto ) , a nice young man with beautiful hands who loves horror movies . Moreover , May's hot , sensuous , predatory lesbian co-worker Polly ( perfectly essayed with deliciously sassy'n'saucy aplomb by Anna Faris ) has developed a lascivious interest in her as well . Alas , both Adam and Polly alike inevitably break May's poor little heart , thus causing May's already fragile hold on sanity to crumble altogether to the point where she goes murderously around the bend . May decides that the only way she will ever have an ideal companion is to make one out of the various body parts of people she kills . Writer / director Lucky McKee has created an astonishingly rich , complex and compelling character study of a fascinatingly messed-up oddball individual which wholly succeeds in making said person a completely tragic and pitiable , although scary and dangerous human being . May isn't some charmless one-dimensional grotesque ; she's an excruciatingly lonely , unloved and pathetic human being whose deep-seated ( and dissatisfied ) need for intimacy and basic human connection causes her to become lethally insane . By allowing a window of understanding and sympathy into May's damaged psyche we the viewer in turn are able to feel sorry for her even though her horrible actions sicken and disturb us . This is the astounding triumph of McKee's outstanding debut feature ; he's created a new anguished and tormented human monster that's the striking modern-day equivalent to such touching fright film monsters of yore as Dracula and Frankenstein's monster . Moreover , the fact that the whole story is totally credible makes it that much more horrifying and unnerving . And it's absolutely heart-wrenching as well in its stupendous poignancy , thanks to Angela Bettis ' profoundly moving and utterly convincing portrayal . A total powerhouse that's a definite four star must-see movie .
519367	8239592	56869	10.0	Alfred Hitchcock's undeniably outstanding killer animal horror masterpiece	I finally bought a copy of Alfred Hitchcock's undeniably outstanding killer animal fright film masterpiece on DVD and rewatched it . Although I've viewed it many times , " The Birds " still managed to creep me out and make my hair stand on end as I saw it yet again . I think this alone serves a sterling testament to just what a remarkably strong and scary movie " The Birds " truly is . Hitchcock's extremely meticulous and thus thoroughly believable evocation of a pedestrian everyday mundane world populated by ordinary , yet engaging and interesting true-to-life characters going about their usual business that's violently disrupted by the savage , shocking and inexplicable hostile attacks by every kind of bird qualifies as his major artistic triumph here . There's a conviction and plausibility evident in this film which makes it quite powerful and frightening in comparable measure . Moreover , the performances by the top-rate cast are uniformly outstanding ( Tippi Hedren in her delightful film debut , the ever-rugged and appealing Rod Taylor , Jessica Tandy and a very young Veronica Cartwright are all splendid ) , the inspired use of natural sound and conspicuous absence of a standard score is brilliantly effective , the bird attack sequences are stunningly harrowing and horrifying ( the climactic night long siege on the house is an absolute tour-de-force of nerve-wracking terror and tension ) , and the amazingly convincing special effects remain impressive to this very day ( Albert Whitlock's extraordinary matte paintings are simply spectacular ) . Fantastic chillingly ambiguous ending , too . If you haven't seen this one in some time I strongly advise that you watch it again . I'm absolutely certain it will still get under your skin as well .
518503	8239592	70030	10.0	A terrific allegorical Depression-era period action yarn doozy	Nothing gets my blood a boilin ' somethin ' hot more than watching a rugged , brutal , mighty manly man adventure yarn done with plenty of grit , style , and insight . This truly terrific allegorical Depression-era period action doozy concerning the legendary , almost mythical rivalry between train-jumping hobos and the railwaymen who went out of their way to keep these lowly bums in their bottom - rung - of - the - socioeconomic - ladder - place most definitely fits that particular bill with astonishing deftness . Lee Marvin rules the day with his customary effortless virile charm and cool , dry humor as A # 1 , the greatest of all train-hopping hobos who's rightfully revered as a god by his fellow dingy derelicts . Keith Carradine likewise holds his own as Cigarette , the brash punk tyro kid who Marvin teaches the basic hobo ropes to . Ernest Borgnine delivers a fierce , growly , volcanically hostile and quite intimidating portrayal of cruel , callous , " screw with me buster and I'll wipe the floor with your face " stomp-ass villainy as the Shack , an exceptionally mean and ferocious train conductor who would just love to clean A # 1's clock but good . A # 1 vows to do the seemingly impossible by riding the Shack's train all the way to Portland and living to tell the tale . The always on-target , sorely missed Robert Aldrich directs this engrossing story with his trademark tautly wound , very blunt and forceful sinewy élan . Christopher Knopf's meaty , deep-diggin ' script offers a fascinating examination of man's desire to amount to something in life regardless of the station he holds , how status has to be earned ( here given a compelling old guard vs . the new generation spin thanks to the teacher and student relationship between Marvin and Carradine ) , the need for achievement , and the harsh victimization of the poor by the working class . Joseph Biroc's sharp cinematography gives the lush , verdant Oregon wilderness a lovely autumnal look . The fabulous supporting cast reads like a veritable who's who of 70's character actors : Charles Tyner , Matt Clark , Harry Caesar , Elisha Cook , Jr . , Simon Oakland , Vic Tayback , Sid Haig , and even Lance Henrikson in a " blink and you'll miss him " uncredited bit part as a railroad worker . Marty Robbins heartily belts out the stupendously rousing theme song . And the final literal duel of the titans fight between Marvin and Borgnine - - these two really get down and dance a bloody boogie , tearing pieces out of each other's hides with chains , hammers , their own feet and bare hands , and even an enormous ax - - rates as the authentic gnarly article . It's without a doubt the greatest two ugly actors making themselves uglier in a very ugly knock-down , drag-out savage smack-down every filmed - - and an immensely satisfying conclusion to this simply sensational movie .
518875	8239592	74706	10.0	A superb 70's " don't go down to Dixie " Southern-fried drive-in exploitation gem	Eternally entrancing firebrand actress Yvette Mimieux scores her best , strongest , most commanding and effective role to date as a smart , classy , fiercely self-sufficient no bullst Los Angeles businesswoman who runs afoul of psycho hicks and rapist redneck cops when she goes down South during her cross country trek from California to New York . Poor Yvette has one of those days which justifies the age-old cliché " sometimes it's better to stay home in bed " : her car is stolen by a creepy backwoods hick nutjob ( an intense , jittery Robert Carradine , who's genuinely frightening in a rare full-blooded sicko fruitcake part ) , she's wrongly put in the hoosegow by the local yokel cops after loutish bartender Britt Leach tries to sexually assault her , kills one particularly unpleasant hillbilly fuzzball after he brutally rapes her ( the rape scene itself is quite graphic and upsetting ) , breaks out of jail and subsequently goes on the lam with tough , but tender-hearted career criminal Tommy Lee Jones . " Jackson County Jail " qualifies as one of those great legendary rarities : it's a 70's redneck drive-in exploitation movie that not only delivers the goods and then some , but also the kind of gritty , top-notch , fairly plausible flick that both wholly earns and completely lives up to its killer cult status . Mark Miller's remarkably artful and assured direction plays a key role in making the film the grind-house classic that it is : the quick , unrelenting pace never let's up for a minute , the action scenes are rousing and marvelously choreographed , and the solid , pretty complicated and arresting narrative hooks the viewer from the get-go . Moreover , the film's astute depiction of the relative differences and similarities between cops and criminals is wickedly subversive : The crooks for the most part are loyal , honorable and compassionate folks while a majority of the police are total aholes . This deliciously amoral masterstroke , a typically twisted piece of 70's B-movie nihilism which boldly bucks convention , lifts " Jackson County Jail " well above the rut of your standard-issue by-the-numbers formula drive-in fare . However , that's not to say that " Jackson County Jail " fails to hit the bull's eye in other departments ; it's an across-the-board winner in every conceivable way . The uniformly excellent cast alone testifies to this : Severn Darden as a prissy , kindly , quirky sheriff , Howard Hesseman as Yvette's faithless smarmy husband , Mary Woronov as a butch lesbian outlaw gal , " Revenge of the Cheerleaders " ' s adorable lead bimbo Patrice Rohmer as Jones ' jealous ex-girlfriend , Cliff Emmich as a loathsome male chauvinist CEO Yvette tells off at the start of the movie , and future " Hill Street Blues " TV series regular Betty Thomas as a saucy , outspoken greasy spoon waitress who tries to fleece bucks . Loren Newkirk's melancholy , harmonica-heavy , nicely down-home country score , the often razor-sharp dialogue ( when Yvette tells Jones to be careful when he faces off with the pigs at the film's thrilling conclusion , Jones responds with this choice fatalistic retort : " I was born dead anyway " ) , the unsparingly bleak and harsh downbeat nightmarish tone , and especially Bruce Logan's agile , polished cinematography ( the use of hand-held camera for Jones ' climactic face-off with the law really does the stirring trick ) are all also highly impressive . Gripping , suspenseful and exciting in comparable measure , " Jackson County Jail " stands tall as a sterling example of 70's hayseed exploitation cinema at its tense , tantalizing zenith .
518645	8239592	60345	10.0	A simply delightful yuletide TV special gem	Bitter , hateful , grouchy hermit the Grinch has no love or respect for the Christmas holiday season . The Grinch decides to rain on everybody's parade by dressing up like Santa Claus and stealing all the food , presents and decorations from the town of Whoville . Directed by the legendary Chuck Jones and Bob Washam , this truly magnificent Noel holiday TV special classic has a touching and wonderfully uplifting central message about the real meaning of Christmas . Boris Karloff's marvelously sonorous and whimsical narration rates as another substantial plus and his soothing velvet smooth voice is perfect as the Grinch . June Foray is absolutely adorable as the voice of Cindy Lou Who . Moreover , the lovely , jaunty score by Albert Hague ( the music teacher on the TV series " Fame " ) is a joy to listen to , with the rousing polka-inspired " Trim Up the Tree " making for an especially charming tune . Of course , the incredibly catchy and groovy number " You're A Mean One , Mr . Grinch , " with its witty oddball lyrics ( " You're brain is full of spiders / You've got garlic in your soul " ) and terrific deep growly booming vocal by Thurl Ravenscroft ( the voice of Tony the Tiger in countless Kellog's Frosted Frakes TV commercials ) , smokes in no uncertain terms . The quirky and imaginative animation boasts plenty of gorgeously vibrant colors and makes occasional nifty use of montage . But ultimately what qualifies this show as so special and endearing is that , unlike the nasty old Grinch , it has a very big and warm heart .
518132	8239592	121694	10.0	An absolutely astonishing camp riot	This astoundingly abysmal piece of unmitigated schlock rates highly as one of the single most sublimely stupid and sidesplitting kitsch hoots I've had the pleasure to watch in quite a while . An evil drug lord uses a bunch of rot-faced hopping vampires to retain his power . Narcotics agent Tom Wilde gets shot and killed in the line of duty . He's brought back to life as a lethal and unstoppable cyborg who looks like he's been wrapped from head to toe in bright shiny tin foil . Meanwhile a macho meathead mercenary guy battles dope dealers in the jungle who have abducted a beautiful blonde babe agent . Boy , does this jaw-dropping dreadful doozy possess all the correct so - utterly - wrong - that - they're - paradoxically - right stuff to qualify as a real four-star stinkeroonie : fumbling ( mis ) direction , priceless dopey dialogue ( favorite line : " Kill the priest , quick ! " ) , ineptly staged shoot-outs , hilariously horrible dubbing , plentiful gut-busting over-the-top chopysocky fight scenes , broadly drawn characters , horrendously hammy acting , a silly romantic subplot involving the head vampire guy who can fire sparks from his fingertips and a sexy ghost girl wearing a semi-transparent gown ( said sexy ghost girl is obviously doubled by a man during her more strenuous fight scenes ! ) , a generic hum'n'shiver synthesizer score , outrageously gruesome , yet tacky gore , a rambling and barely coherent narrative ( this flick is clearly two separate movies which have been sloppily edited together ) , a nonstop frantic pace , and a seriously messed-up story that clumsily combines elements of horror , action , martial arts , crime thriller and even comedy into a spectacularly ungodly brew . An undeniably awful , but often uproarious and always immensely entertaining serving of infectiously inane celluloid lunacy .
518348	8239592	67525	10.0	It's the end of the world with Chuck Heston - - and it's a total groove , baby !	Richard Matheson's terrific novel " I Am Legend " has been twice adapted for the big screen . The first adaptation was " The Last Man on Earth , " an unsparingly grim'n'gloomy Italian mid 60's Gothic horror outing starring Vincent Price . " The Omega Man " on the other hand is a lively undead corpse of an altogether separate hue - - and it's one rip-roaringly loud , gaudy , tripped-out funky-a blinding Day-Glow color at that . Yep , this American made sci-fi / action baby only retains the central premise of Matheson's book , embellishing greatly on the story so it can snazzily cater to all the hip'n'happening trends of the early 70's . The film serves as a wildly distorted and hugely entertaining funhouse mirror reflection of the heady early 70's and nowadays naturally represents a hopelessly dated , yet still oddly charming time capsule of a bygone era . A terrible plague has wiped out most of mankind and turned the bulk of folks who are still alive into crazed albino mutants . Famed NRA spokesman and archetypal post-nuke sci-fi / action survivalist icon par excellence Charlton Heston portrays with his customary steely resolve and firm granite jaw one Robert Neville , an unattached , sardonically wisecracking , rough'n'tumble machine gun-toting bachelor scientist who lives in an eerily empty and desolate Los Angeles along with a lethal bunch of the evil albino mutants . Led by former TV newscaster turned Charles Manson-style cult leader Matthias ( deliciously essayed with lip-smacking hammy relish by veteran villainous character actor Anthony Zerbe ) , the smart , calculating , shades-wearing nocturnal albino mutants call themselves " brother " and " sister , " wear cowled black robes which make them resemble deranged monks , use bows and arrows as weapons , and wish to destroy all remnants of modern society so they can create a new technology-free medieval world . These gloriously gaga freaks come across like a marvelously malign cross between the Manson Family and the Black Panthers . Meanwhile our carefree and nonchalant human hero Heston tools around the barren ruins of LA in a fancy convertible while blasting the sappy theme of " A Summer Place " on his 8-track stereo ( ! ) , treats himself to countless free showings of " Woodstock , " blithely blows away lots of mutants with his trusty machine gun , sips fine wine and plays chess with himself , and has a steamy interracial affair with a spunky black lady survivor ( the delightful Rosalind Cash , sporting a jumbo Afro that would make Pam Grier blush ) . Heston runs across a handful of mellow hippie kids led by motorcycle-riding longhair Paul Koslo who have all somehow managed to avoid being infected by the disease . It gets better . WARNING : Big old nasty SPOILER ahead . The film ends on a ridiculous optimistic note with Heston being done in by a spear-tossing Matthias ; a serum made from his blood is left behind to cure the survivors . Best of all , Heston croaks with his arms outstretched in a cheesy Jesus Christ on the cross posture , a self-deifying image that's further hammered home by a tacky solarized final freeze frame . The closing visual reveals the entire picture to be nothing more than a silly , thinly veiled Christ allegory . Yep , the basic tone strongly adheres to an extremely conventional and conservative Christian mentality , a giddy upbeat mindset which in turn makes this amazing item an absolute four-star camp hoot of the highest order . The scenes of Heston roaming through the bleak and abandoned city streets are wonderfully bizarre and haunting , highlighted by Heston's extraordinary " the phone isn't ringing " crack-up scene . It's this pervasive straight-faced sense of total inside-out strangeness which gives this fabulously flipped-out film its peculiarly irresistible oddball appeal .
519191	8239592	90771	10.0	An awesomely awful 80's direct-to-video sci-fi / horror atrocity	They're bad movies and then there's exceptionally atrocious , brain-numbing , please God make it stop jaw-stopping spectacles of sheer mind-rotting awfulness that are so utterly abominable that they defy belief and soar off into a stratosphere of extraordinary stinkiness that's a ghastly wonder to behold . " Breeders " qualifies as one of those special kind of schlocky treats . The gloriously sordid premise centers on an ugly , scaly , oversexed humanoid reptile lizard alien ( actually , it's some poor schmoe in a laughably obvious and unconvincing rubber suit ) who kidnaps and rapes a lovely assortment of Big Apple virgins so it can reproduce its species for an impending invasion . Colorless cop Lance Lewman and dull doctor Teresa Farley try to stop the evil extraterrestrial menace , but since they're both incredibly insipid and can't act their way out of a soggy cardboard box one quite frankly doesn't give a st if they succeed or not . Boy , does this beautifully botched baby contain all the right wrong stuff to rate highly as one four-star clinker : flat , uninspired ( mis ) direction by the chronically inept Tim Kincaid ( who also makes gay porno under the name of Joe Gage ) , a grating synthesizer score , pathetic make-up f / x by Ed French ( in one particularly pitiful scene the viewer can clearly see that the actor playing the hormonal alien is wearing sneakers ! ) , plodding pacing , relentlessly cheap'n'chintzy production values , dire dialogue , and staggeringly putrid acting from the entire cast . Fortunately , there's a tasty plenitude of gratuitous distaff nudity from a smoking hot bunch of luscious young women ; almost every luckless lass who gets attacked is either disrobing or in the shower when they get jumped . Special credit must be given here to the beauteous brunette hottie supreme Frances Raines , who performs a lengthy Jane Fonda-style aerobic workout clad only in her birthday suit that's leeringly lingered on by the filmmakers . A truly choice chunk of deliciously dreadful celluloid cheese .
519098	8239592	75343	10.0	This so - awful - it's - downright - awesome 70's Grade Z creature feature schlocker quite simply rocks ( pun intended )	Loner mineralogist Paul Carlson ( drably played by the singularly dry and uncharismatic Chase Cordell , who alas never acted in another film ) gets a piece of moon rock lodged in his skull during a meteorite shower . The decidedly lethal chunk of green cheese has a severely bad effect on Paul come nightfall : He transforms into a hilariously cruddy-looking humanoid lunar lizard that ravages the dark , desolate New Mexico countryside , leaving a trail of bloody , mutilated corpses in its deadly wake . It's up to Paul's wise old Native American buddy Johnny Longbow ( poker-faced , more-wooden-than-a-giant-oak stiff Gregorio Sala , who gets to say all this funky mystical prophecy mumbo jumbo about how the murderous reptilian creature is really an ancient Indian god come to life so it can bring about the end of the world ) , aided by Paul's leggy bimbo photographer squeeze Cathy Noland and clueless , stolid local yokel Sheriff Mack ( glumly essayed by Patrick Wright , a beefy , curly-haired perennial co-star in numerous 70's exploitation films who played similar dippy cop roles in " Caged Heat , " " Revenge of the Cheerleaders , " and " Roller Boogie " ) , to stop the scaly , sanguinary , nefarious nocturnal were-lizard beast . Thanks to such tried'n'true so - bad - that - they're - perversely - beautiful ingredients as rank community theater level acting ( although Donna Leigh Drake as Cathy almost compensates for her woeful lack of thespic prowess by wearing these drastically cut blue denim hot pants which show off a lot of her long , shapely , well-tanned stems throughout the entire picture ) , Joe ( " Ilsa " ) Blasco's horrendously chintzy and unconvincing make-up f / x ( Joe also plays the titular butt-ugly critter ) , Bob ( " Ginger " ) Orpin's corny score , a memorably ridiculous creature that was designed by a young , unknown , just starting out up-and-coming Rick Baker ( I'm sure he still lists this baby on his resume ) , a horrifically bad aspiring folkie singer / songwriter who briefly appears on-screen to bleat out the unforgettably insipid folk-pop ditty " California Lady " in a dreadfully slight , nasal , off-key tenor voice , uproariously godawful dialogue ( favorite line : " If I'm gonna die , I wanna die looking like a man - - NOT like a monster ! " ) , painfully gradual molasses going uphill in the wintertime sluggish pacing , several very amusing , dimly lit nighttime attack scenes ( the best-ever assault occurs when Moonie rips open a tent so he can make grisly hash out of a bunch of redneck card players ; one poor guy has his arm torn clean out of its socket and not a single drop of blood gushes forth from the gaping wound ! ) , and poor ( mis ) direction by Dick Ashe ( who oddly enough never helmed another feature ) , " Track of the Moonbeast " makes for an unsparingly ludicrous , often risible and hence quite entertaining so - shoddy - it's - strangely - sublime low-budget horror flick howler .
519214	8239592	54443	10.0	A superbly eerie , intelligent and ambiguous 60's British sci-fi / horror gem	Quite simply one of the all-time great spooky and atmospheric British sci-fi / horror winners from the 60's , this supremely chilling and engrossing knockout still packs a potent , lingering punch even today . All the young women in the quiet remote English hamlet of Midwich mysteriously become pregnant after the whole populace goes into a bizarre and abrupt 24-hour trance . The ladies give birth to a bunch of odd , emotionless , tow-headed kids with extraordinary kinetic and telepathic abilities . They also have glowing bright eyes , unusual fingernails , and acute advanced intellects . Moreover , the murderous moppets casually kill anyone they perceive as a threat in strange and startling " accidents . " Some of the frightened townspeople stand up to the freaky tykes to no avail . It's ultimately up to brave and perceptive military scientist George Sanders ( who gives a truly outstanding performance ) to put a stop to ' em before it's too late . Tautly directed with commendable understatement by Wolf Rilla , with a smart and compact script co-written by future Oscar-winning screenwriter Stirling Stilliphant , gorgeous black-and-white cinematography , a nicely spare and shivery score , an eerily ambiguous tone , a pleasingly concise 78 minute running time , uniformly aces acting from a top-drawer cast ( the child thespians are extremely unsettling while Hammer horror queen Barbara Shelley makes for a very charming and pretty damsel in distress ) , and a genuinely nerve-wracking conclusion , " Village of the Damned " never falters for a minute . The film's smashing success derives partly from Rilla's wisely stark and straightforward execution , partly from the sheer vague creepiness of the intriguing plot ( no explanation is ever given for how or why the children were born in the first place ) , and primarily from downplaying needless flashy special effects razzle-dazzle to emphasize instead the strong and absorbing adults vs . children conflict at the heart of the narrative ( this movie could be read as a weird and imaginative fantastic allegory on the generation gap that was a key hallmark of the 60's ) . A terrific terror tale that's wholly deserving of its substantial classic status .
518603	8239592	89912	10.0	The true reason cinema was invented . An absolute celluloid masterpiece of exceptional subtlety and profound artistic significance	As the extremely subtle , tasteful and artistic title alone suggests , this here is one of those unsung cinematic masterpieces , a monumentally important and incisive cinematic landmark of tremendous cultural significance , a profound and provocative rumination on the complex multi-faceted tenets of the human condition , sheer celluloid poetry . . . hey , who the hell am I fooling ? Scratch that high-faluting nonsense . As the extraordinarily asinine title truly suggests , this steaming hunk of utterly worthless and artless cinematic offal is a sublimely shoddy , silly and downright stupid slice of slapdash spoofy sci-fi piffle any avid connoisseur of sheer celluloid detritus should relish every last dopey , dunced-out dreckoid minute of . The so-called " plot " plumbs startling new depths in the history of " you gotta be kidding me ! " celluloid idiocy : A luscious quartet of predatory and temperamental outer space babes land in the sleepy hamlet of Mayfield to find hunky attractive teenage fellows to mate with . Any person who ticks off the hot'n'horny extraterrestrial honeys gets transformed into gigantic humanoid vegetables such as carrots , pickles , tomatoes , zucchinis , and even squash ! It's up to the boys ' insanely jealous and possessive girlfriends to thwart the perniciously seductive distaff alien menace . Okay , witty and sophisticated the story sure ain't , but frankly who cares about that highbrow artsy crap ? In place of that stuff we got a meandering narrative , mostly decent acting from a game no-name cast , a bevy of nice-looking chicks in skimpy outfits , a goofy synthesizer score set to a thumpin ' disco beat , a touching subplot concerning one alien mother getting to know the psychic half-human son she had 16 years ago ( oh the pathos ! ) , lots of dumb dialogue ( sample line : " Wait a minute - - this is ridiculous ! " ) , chintzy ( far from ) special effects , and cheapo production values that are just a step or two above a homemade stag movie . Granted , this doozy never matches the sidesplitting lunacy of the brilliantly berserk " Invasion of the Girl Snatchers , " but it's still an amiably brainless and hugely enjoyable piece of inconsequential fluff all the same .
518415	8239592	59026	10.0	Still holds up after over 40 years	Yeah , this particular enduring ( and endearing ) classic TV special was indeed made over forty years ago , but still retains its magical ability to cast an enchanting spell just the same . It's partly because of the appealing topicality of the central story ( mopey Charlie Brown can't get into the Noel spirit because of the current crass commercialism of the yuletide season ) , partly because the key message makes a significant point about Christmas without ever becoming too preachy or sappy , and mainly because the show itself astutely captures the joy , warmth and humanity of Christmas in a most lovely and moving way . Director Bill Melendez and writer Charles M . Schultz keep things beautifully simple and unpretentious throughout . Moreover , the cast of lovably awkward kid voice actors add a certain clumsy charm to their characters . And what a likable and colorful bunch of characters we have here , starting with the hapless , yet persistent Charlie Brown , highlighted by the marvelously irrepressible buoyancy of the ever-chipper Snoopy , and given an extra lift by Lucy's delicious meanness , the wise-beyond-his-years sagacity of Linus , and the giddy slovenliness of the hysterically filthy Pigpen . The bright and vibrant animation might seem a tad crude by today's more advanced standards , but gets the job done nonetheless . Vince Guaraldi's delightfully jaunty'n'jazzy score hits the rousing spot . The snappy tempo and merry tone are likewise totally on the money excellent . A real treat that should be watched at least once a year around Christmastime .
518098	8239592	54673	10.0	A positively gut-busting no-budget camp classic !	Widely hailed as one of the single most spectacularly shoddy pictures to ever disgrace the big screen , Coleman Francis ' notorious Grade Z cheapie clinker makes for an admittedly painful , but still oddly hypnotic and hence unforgettable viewing experience . The massive Tor Johnson of " Plan 9 from Outer Space " infamy stars as Joseph Javorsky , a noted Russian scientist who becomes a dangerous murderous mutant after being exposed to radiation . Writer / director Francis shows an appalling lack of both skill and finesse as a filmmaker : the plodding pace crawls along at an agonizingly sluggish clip , the continuity is dreadful ( the opening pre-credits sequence with some phantom psycho strangling a woman has nothing whatsoever to do with the rest of the movie ! ) , the screaming , four-sheets-to-the-wind overblown score roars away to an irritatingly incessant degree , tubby old Tor isn't remotely frightening or menacing ( plus he appears to have dried egg smeared all over his face ! ) , the infrequent action scenes are poorly staged and unexciting , the scratchy cinematography boasts plenty of clumsy pans and primitive fade-outs , and , worst of all , the ridiculously solemn stream-of-consciousness nonsensical narration by Francis himself blathers away throughout the entire flick about such unrelated foolishness as flying saucers and little kids feeding soda pop to thirsty pigs . However , the final moment between a dying Tor and a cute little bunny rabbit rates highly as a sterling example of sheer celluloid poetry at its most achingly pure and poignant . For all its undeniable crumminess , this slow and static stinker still casts a strangely mesmerizing spell on the dumbfounded viewer . Truly astounding in its jaw-dropping awfulness .
518559	8239592	89348	10.0	The Commies are coming ! The Commies are coming ! Save us Chuck Norris !	Our country is in big trouble : a ragtag multi-ethnic guerrilla army of nefarious Communist terrorists led by no-account Russian psycho Rostov ( veteran screen villain Richard Lynch in peak nasty'n'snarly form ) have washed up on the Florida coast . These horrible scumbuckets first slaughter a boat full of helpless Cuban refugees . Next they butcher a libidinous teen couple making out on the beach . Then they blow up six suburban houses populated by folks merrily celebrating the yuletide holiday with a single rocket launcher . They even gun down nice Latino youths . Worse yet , they have the appalling gall to attack a mall at the height of the Christmas shopping season . Why , these foul scum not only attempt to blow up a church holding a mass , but also a school bus loaded with little children happily singing " Row , Row , Row Your Boat . " But have no fear , good Americans . Thankfully we got Matt Hunter ( legendary martial arts champion and hopelessly wooden thespian Chuck Norris , who co-wrote the senseless script ) to save the day . Who's Matt Hunter ? Well , apparently he's some kind of former government agent , although we never are told any specific details about his background . Does it matter ? Not in the least . Moreover , Hunter has the magical ability to materialize seemingly out of thin air in his souped-up pick-up truck whenever he's needed to stomp some evil commie butt . Nonstop wall-to-wall mondo destructo ultra-violent carnage is the order of the day here . And boy does director Joseph Zito really pour it on thick , blowing up lots of stuff real good , staging insanely go-for-broke vehicular action sequences with rip-snorting aplomb , and racking up an astonishingly hefty body count . Better still , both Joao Fernandes's slick photography and Jay Chattaway's robust , rousing score are up to snuff , Melissa Prophet gives a spectacularly terrible performance as a spunky , yet troublesome lady reporter , Eddie Jones just takes up space as a useless FBI agent , Billy Drago briefly pops up as a slimy drug dealer , the basic overwrought tone represents Reagan era Red Scare paranoia at its most ludicrously hysterical , and Norris cuts loose with a steady series of truly groan-inducing cheesy quips every time he commits a heroic feat . Now , is this film any good ? No , it most certainly ain't . In fact , it's exceptionally bad , stupid and utterly mindless . But there's no denying that it's a great deal of so - totally - dreadful - it's - oddly - delectable Grade Z schlocky fun . A real four star high camp 80's trash movie hoot and a half .
519409	8239592	58631	10.0	A simply sensational 60's rock concert winner	That's the " Teenage Awards Music International " to you and me - - and without a doubt one of the best , grooviest , most utterly enjoyable and righteously raucous , hell , even historically relevant , mid-60's rock concert films to ever romp its way onto celluloid , a dazzling and eclectic mix of rowdy rock'n'roll bands and class act rhythm and blues groups that was performed live at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium and recorded on videotape and subsequently transferred to film for posterity's sake by American International Pictures . Puckish surf-rock jokers Jan and Dean , who do " The Little Old Lady from Pasadena " and " Sidewalk Surfin ' , " are the goof-ball hosts of this non-stop musical extravaganza . Chuck Berry gets things off to a rip-roaring start , working his spindly wibble-wobble legs overtime as he tears the place up with roll-over-deadly renditions of " Johnny B . Goode , " " Sweet Little Sixteen , " and " Nadine . " British Invasion band Gerry and the Peacemakers keep everything a hopping by first joining Chuck on " Maybellene , ' then holding their own with such winners as the gentle , lulling " Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying " and the life-affirming " It's Gonna Be Alright . " Lovely feminist-rock pioneer Lesley Gore mesmerizes the audience with strong , commanding performances of the " sisters stand up to your man and don't take any guff " anthems " You Don't Own Me , " " It's My Party , " and " Judy's Turn to Cry . " Smokey Robinson and the Miracles deliver a tasty , tuneful truckload of spot-on keening tenor harmonies , highlighted by the gorgeous " You Really Got a Hold on Me " and a crazed , chest-thumping , abdomen-itching cover of the wiggy novelty dance number " Mickey's Monkey . " Marvin Gaye , looking mighty spiffy in an immaculate white tux , cuts a suave figure as he belts out " Hitchhike , " " Pride and Joy , " and " Can I Get a Witness . " Representing flavor-of-the-month generic pop slop , the hopelessly dweeby Billy J . Kramer and the Dakotas nerd it up something hysterical with several remarkably doofy songs . Diana Ross and the Supremes , sexy as all hell in clinging dresses and enormous heavily lacquered hairdos , strut their sultry stuff with a scorching medley which includes the luscious " Baby Love . " Token grunged-up garage rock outfit the Barbarians do the sinewy caveman stomper " Hey Little Bird , " with their famous one-armed drummer Moulty ( he's got a hook hand ! ) gleefully trashing his kit during a gloriously protracted solo . James Brown rides the " Night Train " straight to Funkytown and back with his bring the house down manic antics , complete with wild dancing feet , hips and pelvis a swinging rotation action , the groin pulling splits , crashing onto the floor and getting up for more - - we're talking some seriously smoking theatrics , people . The Rolling Stones , surly , scruffy , arrogant and punk as all get out , burn up the place with lots of sizzling lowdown dirty blues covers , with their blazing rendition of Irma Thomas ' " Time Is On My Side " rating as the definite stand-out . The Beach Boys , clad in white striped shirts , end things on a suitably stirring note , doing 100 % on the money honey performances of the timeless classics " Surfin ' U . S . A . , " " Surfer Girl " and " I Get Around . " Steve Binder's razor-sharp direction captures the concert's merry , upbeat , bubbly atmosphere with consummate unwavering acuity and expertise . The really into it audience never cease to shriek their approval . A sense of both wide-eyed innocence and carefree , frivolous , oftentimes even downright explosive gaiety pervades throughout . The excellent black and white cinematography makes terrific use of stately crane shots , slow , graceful dissolves and snazzy super-impositions . Phil Spector music arranger Jack Nitzsche served as music director . Terri Garr and Toni Basil are among the nice-looking go-go gals who energetically frug their way across the stage . A marvelously vibrant , joyous and jubilant time capsule of the swell 60's rock scene .
