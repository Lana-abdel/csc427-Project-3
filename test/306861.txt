438192	306861	21780	7.0	A Little William Haines Romantic Comedy	The American nephew of an English nobleman is appalled at the prospect of an arranged marriage . To prove to his uncle that all girls are not sweet & innocent , he disguises himself as his intended's paid dancing companion , to see if she'll have an affair with him . To his surprise , he falls in love with her . When she catches on to the trick , will she acknowledge her hidden love for him , or will she continue to treat him as JUST A GIGOLO ? William Haines , always enjoyable to watch , sparks this little pre-Production Code comedy , in which his silly-billy antics are toned down a bit . He's particularly fun in the climaxing scenes at the San Sebastian Inn , when he thinks Irene Purcell has surrendered a wee bit too far to his charms . Miss Purcell gives a pert performance as a spoiled young noblewoman in need of firm handling . Wonderful old Sir C . Aubrey Smith is excellent as a crusty lord who has much to learn about modern youth , circa 1931 . Haines was one of the art directors on this picture . The following year , with his dismissal from MGM , he would start a new & very successful career as a Hollywood interior decorator .
438194	306861	28353	7.0	Jeeves & Wooster - Sir P . G . Wodehouse's Classic Creations	When muddleheaded Bertie Wooster - London playboy & man about town - gets himself into trouble , he can always rely on the inimitable Jeeves , his gentleman's gentleman , to extricate him from the plight . When Bertie becomes involved with a beautiful mystery woman , Jeeves must utilize brawn , not brain , to rescue him from a dangerous gang of international thieves . Hopefully , Wooster will once again be able to say , ' THANK YOU , JEEVES ! ' Very loosely based on one of his novels , Sir P . G . Wodehouse's immortal characters come alive in this , the first of two Jeeves films produced by 20th Century Fox . At only 57 minutes long , the film wastes no time in getting into its funny business . Fans of the short stories & novels will notice that liberties were taken with the characters . Jeeves is less of the all-knowing automaton ; in fact , he uses not his cerebral matter but a knowledge of fisticuffs to catch the villains . Bertie is still rather zany , but his ( eventual ) success with the fair sex has noticeably improved . Having played butlers so often , Arthur Treacher here has the plum role of his career . He is perfect as Jeeves : tall , with forbidding intellect - but not afraid to unbend and sing a rousing hunting song or swing a mean battle-ax . David Niven is a lot of fun as Wooster , vague & a bit befuddled , but loyal & brave in defending his lady love . She is played nicely by Virginia Field . Willie Best has some very funny moments as a stranded saxophonist who adds to the hilarity .
438341	306861	38978	7.0	Pluto's Pests	A Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE Cartoon . A couple of chipmunks believe they have SQUATTER'S RIGHTS in Mickey's mountain cabin . This enjoyable , albeit unremarkable , cartoon was the second to feature the Chipmunks - although they had yet to completely metamorphose into Chip ' n ' Dale . Their dialogue is almost completely unintelligible . Pluto gets most of the screen time - Mickey is left with just the bits & pieces . The last gag is strangely cruel . Nominated for an Academy Award . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Bambi , Peter Pan and Mr . Toad . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .

437945	306861	34886	7.0	Sonja Skates - Script Sinks	A pretty miss in ICELAND falls for an American Marine corporal stationed there temporarily during World War Two . Sonja Henie was Norway's ice queen when she won Olympic gold medals for skating in 1928 , 1932 & 1936 . After going professional , she began a celebrated movie career at 20th Century Fox in 1936 with her American film debut , ONE IN A MILLION . Beautiful & talented , as well as being a natural in front of the cameras , she carved out her own special niche during Hollywood's Golden Age . Although Miss Henie's ice routines may look antiquated by comparison to modern champions , there was nothing antique about her dazzling smile or sparkling personality . In this regard , some of today's snowflake princesses could still learn a great deal from her . As her career progressed , it became increasingly difficult for 20th Century Fox to find decent stories for Miss Henie and the excuses for the lavish ice dancing numbers were often implausible . No matter . Audiences did not flock to her films to watch Sonja recite Shakespeare . The movies were meant to be pure escapist fantasy , plain & simple . ICELAND is no exception and its story is often quite ludicrous . However , the skating episodes are pleasing and there is a generous amount of band music supplied by the Sammy Kaye Orchestra , which introduces ' There Will Never Be Another You , ' by Mack Gordon & Harry Warren . Thanks to the script , John Payne's romance with Sonja is kept a rather dull affair . As Payne's sidekick , Jack Oakie comes across as loud & annoying . Felix Bressart , a fine actor when given something decent to work with , plays Sonja's silly Papa . Fritz Feld makes the most of his few minutes as an inquisitive Icelandic functionary . Movie mavens will recognize an oddly uncredited Sterling Holloway , who is very funny as Sonja's erstwhile suitor . Ultimately , though , this is Sonja's show . She glides effortlessly into the viewer's heart , while balancing on a thin edge of silver , suspended over frozen water .
437052	306861	21534	7.0	One Of The Dreadful Films John Gilbert Made For MGM To Fulfill His Contract	Here comes the Merchant Marine , the toughest seamen afloat . Sailing into every sea , a job in every port , a girl in every bar . Out of the way there ! Here they come , up from the docks , looking for some shore leave . Look out ! Make WAY FOR A SAILOR ! According to cinematic legend , all the talkie MGM films starring John Gilbert were dreadful - the result of a bitter hatred between Gilbert ( the highest paid star in Hollywood , with a $1 . 5 million contract ) & studio boss Louis B . Mayer . A determination on Gilbert's part to fulfill the contract , and a campaign instituted by Mayer to destroy Gilbert's career - including spreading the rumor that Gilbert's voice was ' high & feminine ' , culminated in several unwatchable movies . Not entirely true . The Studio had a huge financial investment in Jack Gilbert and was not going to completely cut its own throat by showcasing him in nothing but dreck . Of the 8 talkies in which he appeared as solo star ( 1929 - HIS GLORIOUS NIGHT ; 1930 - REDEMPTION ; WAY FOR A SAILOR ; 1931 - GENTLEMAN'S FATE ; THE PHANTOM OF PARIS ; WEST OF BROADWAY ; 1932 - DOWNSTAIRS ; 1933 - FAST WORKERS ) most were certainly rather ghastly . WAY FOR A SAILOR falls into that unfortunate category . Gilbert tries hard throughout the film , but it never comes together . Atmospherics are of the ' B Movie ' variety , and while the rescue at sea sequence is exciting , it's not enough to save the film . Even wonderful Wallace Beery , bluff & hearty , can't pull it off , though he certainly is entertaining & manages to steal every scene he's in . And lovely Leila Hyams is boring , thanks mostly to a lackluster script . Look fast and you'll spot Doris Lloyd & the inimitable Polly Moran , both enjoyable as dockside floozies ( Polly wields a mean mallet ) . Movie mavens will recognize Sojin as the Oriental procurer ; quick-eyed viewers may spot an uncredited Ray Milland as a ship's officer . Finally , about The Voice . There was nothing at all strange or unnaturally high about Gilbert's voice . As a matter of fact , it was of medium range & rather cultured & refined . Which was the crux of the problem , of course . While it is possible that no voice could have ever matched the perfect one viewers heard in their minds while watching his strong , virile silent roles , the reality was very different from what they wanted to hear ( imagine Robert Montgomery's voice coming out of Clark Gable's mouth . ) Gilbert was doomed from his first scene in his debut talkie ; his war with Mayer only intensified the agony . He would die in 1936 , forgotten by most of his former fans , at the age of only 36 .

The two tiny CORN CHIPS ( Chip ' n ' Dale ) turn Donald's snowy front yard into a battlefield as they fight him for control of his popcorn . Here is another routine Duck versus Chipmunks film , but the antagonists are always a pleasure to watch . Clarence " Ducky " Nash supplies Donald's voice ; the Chipmunks are often unintelligible .

Challenging the verbose twerp to a boat race , Alfalfa skippers a floating contraption of his own , crewed by Buckwheat & Porky . Are these THREE MEN IN A TUB really up to the contest ? Not a lot of laughs in this little film . Waldo's persiflage & Darla's histrionics become rather annoying . Highlight : the three-duck power engine .
437348	306861	25263	7.0	An Invitation From Mr . Jimmy Durante	That romantic & devilishly handsome movie star , Jimmy Durante , decides to throw the HOLLYWOOD PARTY every celebrity in town will want to attend . And he does , with somewhat mixed results . This nonsense film ( no directors are credited , but several important ones were involved ) was an excuse for MGM to show off , somewhat ostentatiously , its comedy talent . Enough talent , indeed , to waste . Laurel & Hardy show up for a scene with Lupe Velez and it is hilarious . The ubiquitous Polly Moran , Charles Butterworth & Arthur Treacher are generally worth watching . Ted Healey & The 3 Stooges , Jack Pearl & Eddie Quillan are hampered by inadequate material . Even Robert Young appears for a few moments , playing himself and looking a wee bit silly . Apparently having wandered over from another studio , Mickey Mouse shows up unexpectedly , in animated form & voiced by Walt Disney . He proves he can hold his own in trading wisecracks with Durante and then introduces a fairly good Disney Technicolor cartoon , ' Hot Chocolate Soldiers ' and it's enjoyable . If you get invited to this party , try hanging out with Stan & Ollie , or The Mouse . They're where all the fun is .

Not to mention a couple of fake psychics who are as crazy as THE CUCKOOS in any clock . This ancient musical was Wheeler & Woolsey's 2nd film ( Bert Wheeler is the little curly-haired guy ; Robert Woolsey is the skinny bespectacled one ) . The Boys are always fun to watch , and they've got some good songs , but when they're off screen the film groans badly . However , it must be said that the massive Jobyna Howland is a great Dumont-esque foil for them & more than holds her own . The Boys ' frequent kewpie-doll co-star , Dorothy Lee , is on hand - and in Wheeler's arms . Ivan Lebedeff is OK as the villain . The romance between June Clyde & Hugh Trevor is dull stuff . Three early Technicolor scenes are included and they are easy on the eyes . Some of the musical numbers seem to exist solely for the purpose of exhibiting the RKO chorus girls in various stages of undress . Wondering what a band of Eastern European gypsies are doing in Northern Mexico ? In films like this you don't ask questions like that . . .
438204	306861	28286	10.0	Over There With Joe E . Brown	A mild-mannered stage comedian is most unhappily swept up into the World War One Army and shipped off to France . Fast-moving & fun , SONS O ' GUNS is another example of the comedy picture that Warner Bros . was so expert at producing during the 1930's . Casts & plots could be shuffled endlessly , with very predictable results . While this assembly line approach created few classics , audience enjoyment could usually be assured . Putty-faced comic Joe E . Brown dominates the film with his special brand of wacky humor . Given a good script , Brown could be a very funny fellow indeed and he lives up to his reputation here , his tremendous mouth and mischievous eyes always on the move , waiting to signal the next wisecrack . Many of his jokes vigorously push the boundaries of the Production Code , which only adds to their amusement . Pretty Joan Blondell , playing an innocent French miss ( with a strangely Russian-sounding accent ) , very much takes second fiddle to Brown , letting him dominate nearly all of their scenes . And even her limited screen time has to be shared with Beverly Roberts as Brown's disaffected fiancée & Wini Shaw as one of the women out of his past . Still , Blondell is always lovely to look at and the film is fortunate to have her . Brown's true costar in the movie is Eric Blore , very droll as the respectful British valet who becomes his employer's tough-talking sergeant in the war's front lines . The very different acting styles of these two gentlemen mesh quite well on screen , and , particularly in their first scenes , provide the viewer with some very enjoyable moments . Movie mavens will recognize Mischa Auer in a small role as a jovial German spy .
438239	306861	23814	10.0	A Tour de Force For Mr . Asther	A young missionary finds herself swept into a world of Oriental intrigue & power , after being ? rescued ' by a Chinese warlord . With THE BITTER TEA OF GENERAL YEN , Columbia Pictures & director Frank Capra created a small cinematic gem . Not only does the film boast of superb production values , a first-class script & excellent performances , but it enwraps its audience in a sensual romance which rewards intelligent viewing , while offering a liberal dash of pre-Code sensibilities . Miscegenation , so soon to become absolutely taboo in Hollywood , here is made palatable & attractive , indeed , reasonable , the natural outcome of passions molded by tumultuous times . Although billed second , Nils Asther takes acting honors in the title role . A matinee idol during silent days , Asther found it difficult to find good roles in talking pictures , hampered by his exotic looks which made him hard to cast to his advantage . But with BITTER TEA he found the role of a lifetime . Although tall & Swedish , he completely inhabits the skin of his Asian character , making the General at once believable & sympathetic . His every movement , shift of the eyes , even the way he chews his food are all part of his persona . Nearly forgotten now , Asther shows with this one performance what he was capable of achieving . As the missionary captive , Barbara Stanwyck gives the kind of competent , skillful & engaging interpretation which she would bring to all of her roles over the course of several decades . Capra's favorite actress , the dramatic flames she lights are an intriguing counterpoint to the repressed emotions of Asther's Yen . Loud , brash Walter Connolly , as the General's financial advisor , makes a good contrast to Asther ; his plainspoken character often gives voice to what the others are thinking . Lovely Toshi Mori graces the role of the General's unfaithful concubine . A young Richard Loo is her secret lover . Movie mavens will recognize Clara Blandick in the role of the feisty missionary hostess at the beginning of the film & Willie Fung as the rebel train engineer , both uncredited . While meant to be funny and introduce the plot , the opening scenes are a bit unfair to Western missionaries in China , portraying them as rather fatuous , repressed & gossipy . By in large , missionaries lived lives full of self-sacrifice & devotion . In return , not a few were rewarded with penury and an early grave . That today the ? Underground Church ' in China numbers many millions of Christian believers stands as a witness to the faithfulness of these good people . The era of the Chinese warlord - such as General Yen in the film - was brief but colorful and extremely violent . The Qing dynasty , China's last , was overthrown in 1911 and the Republic of China was formed . Its despotic president , Yüan Shih-kai , relied more on military force than democratic principles to maintain his authority over China's vast stretches & huge population . Upon his death in 1916 , the country was thrown into confusion & chaos , with numerous military officers & powerful bandit kings all using their armies to control districts and even whole provinces , constantly warring with each other amid a swirling sea of ever-changing alliances and bitter feuds . Foreign powers ( Soviet Russia , Imperial Japan & Great Britain ) only made matters worse by supporting various factions . It was the ordinary Chinese citizen who suffered most , with the depredations of war's brutality & the inevitable famines rained upon them . It was not until 1928 , with the capture of Peking by Republican General Chiang Kai-shek , and the reunification of China , that the power of the warlords was finally broken .
437388	306861	288414	10.0	Jazz Pizzazz	A Walt Disney Cartoon . The Benny Goodman Quartet and the Disney animators give a wildly syncopated swing to the popular tune AFTER YOU'VE GONE . Originally , along with ALL THE CATS JOIN IN , part of TWO FOR THE RECORD , which was Goodman's contribution to Disney's MAKE MINE MUSIC ( 1946 ) , this exuberantly improvisational three-minute film is a feast for the ears & eyes . The Quartet's clarinet , bass , piano & drums come to life and embark on a jaunt through their own animated universe , with constant variations in color & shape which perfectly matches the music . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings .

438005	306861	13099	10.0	Mr . Keaton's Electrifying Experience	A BUSTER KEATON Silent Short . THE ELECTRIC HOUSE Buster has just retrofitted with modern appliances is about to have a chaotic debut when some wires get crossed . . . One sight gag after another keeps this wonderful little film humming along . All of Buster's gadgets are funny when they operate correctly - they slip over the line into hilarity when things go wrong . Highlight : Buster trying to beat an obstinate escalator . Born into a family of Vaudevillian acrobats , Buster Keaton ( 1895-1966 ) mastered physical comedy at a very early age . An association with Fatty Arbuckle led to a series of highly imaginative short subjects and classic , silent feature-length films - all from 1920 to 1928 . Writer , director , star & stuntman - Buster could do it all and his intuitive genius gave him almost miraculous knowledge as to the intricacies of film making and of what it took to please an audience . More akin to Fairbanks than Chaplin , Buster's films were full of splendid adventure , exciting derring-do and the most dangerous physical stunts imaginable . His theme of a little man against the world , who triumphs through bravery & ingenuity , dominates his films . Through every calamity & disaster , Buster remained the Great Stone Face , a stoic survivor in a universe gone mad . In the late 1920's Buster was betrayed by his manager / brother-in-law and his contract was sold to MGM , which proceeded to nearly destroy his career . Teamed initially with Jimmy Durante and eventually allowed small roles in mediocre comedies , Buster was for 35 years consistently given work far beneath his talent . Finally , before lung cancer took him at age 70 , he had the satisfaction of knowing that his classic films were being rediscovered . Now , well past his centenary , Buster Keaton is routinely recognized & appreciated as one of cinema's true authentic geniuses . And he knew how to make people laugh . . .

It should be understood immediately that this movie only borrows the title and a few incidents from Jack London's classic novel . And at that point the comparison between the two should end . This film , rousing & adventurous , is able to stand on its own merits . An excellent cast , fine production values ( notice particularly the care with which Skagway & Dawson are depicted ) and location shooting in Washington State are the film's strongest assets . The plot , meant solely for entertainment , is pure hokum . . . Clark Gable brings his trademark masculinity to a role that didn't require a lot of stretching of his thespian muscles . But in essentially playing himself he is perfectly cast . One cannot overcome the suspicion that London's original story was reworked for the star . Gable had been through this before - remote setting , forces of nature , beautiful woman , adultery . Think RED DUST in the snow . Loretta Young is the beautiful woman . From scene to scene , no matter what the hardship , she remains living proof that a first class Hollywood makeup job can withstand the worst ravages of the Klondike . This is perhaps too harsh . Like Gable , little more is required of her than to exude physicality . She is indeed a treat to the eyes , even if her inclusion in the plot is patently ludicrous . ( The on screen attraction between Gable & Young wasn't faked . A daughter , ostensibly ' adopted ' by Young in France , would be the result . ) As Gable's sidekick , comic Jack Oakie has one of his best screen roles . Getting to play most of his scenes strictly for laughs , he adds chuckles to the story which , one assumes , would have outraged London . Twisting his usual pomposity to a sinister bent , English character actor Reginald Owen is memorable as the film's villain . Dangerously wicked , he makes us want to know more about this man called Smith , with money to burn and a raging temper . The screenplay , wisely , leaves his biography up to the imagination of the viewer . Sidney Toler & Herman Bing are very good in small roles . Movie mavens will recognize Arthur Housman , veteran of many Laurel & Hardy comedy shorts , as a Skagway drunk with a surprisingly mean punch . The affection between Gable and Buck , the great St . Bernard with whom he shares so many scenes , is obvious .
437594	306861	24028	10.0	Cagney Struts His Stuff In Busby Berkley Spectacular	The energetic young producer of theatrical prologues ( those staged performances , usually musical , that often proceeded the movie in the larger cinemas in bygone days ) must deal with crooked competition , fraudulent partners , unfaithful lovers & amateur talent to realize his dream of making his mark on the FOOTLIGHT PARADE . While closely resembling other Warner's musical spectaculars , notably the GOLDDIGGER films , this movie had a special attraction none of the others had : Jimmy Cagney . He is a wonder , loose-jointed and lithe , as agile as any tomcat - a creature he actually mimics a few times during the movie . Cagney grabs the viewers attention & never lets go , powering the rapid-fire dialogue and corny plot with his charisma & buoyant charm . The rest of the cast gives their best , as well . Joan Blondell is perfect as the smart-mouthed , big-hearted blonde secretary , infatuated with Cagney ( major quibble - why wasn't she given a musical number ? ) . Dick Powell & Ruby Keeler once again play lovers onstage & off ; the fact that her singing & acting abilities are a bit on the lean side are compensated for by her dancing ; Powell still exudes boyish enthusiasm in his unaccustomed position as second male lead . Guy Kibbee & Hugh Herbert are lots of fun as brothers-in-law , both scheming to cheat Cagney in different ways . Ruth Donnelly scores as Kibbee's wealthy wife , a woman devoted to her handsome protégés . Frank McHugh's harried choreographer is an apt foil for Cagney's wit . Herman Bing is hilarious in his one tiny scene as a music arranger . Mavens will spot little Billy Barty , Jimmy Conlin & maybe even John Garfield during the musical numbers . Finally , there's Busby Berkeley , choreographer nonpareil . His terpsichorean confections , sprinkled throughout the decade of the 1930's , were a supreme example of the cinematic escapism that Depression audiences wanted to enjoy . The big joke about Berkeley's creations , of course , was that they were meant , as part of the plot , to be stage productions . But no theater could ever hold these products of the master's imagination . They are perfect illustrations of the type of entertainment only made possible by the movie camera . Berkeley's musical offerings generally took one of two different approaches , either a story ( often rather bizarre ) told with song & dance ; or else stunning geometrically designed numbers , eye candy , featuring plentiful chorus girls , overhead camerawork & a romantic tune . In a spasm of outré extravagance , FOOTLIGHT PARADE climaxes with three Berkeley masterworks : ' Honeymoon Hotel ' and its pre-Production Code telling of a couple's wedding night ; ' By A Waterfall ' - dozens of unclad females , splashing , floating & diving in perfect patterns & designs ( peer closely & you'll see how the synchronous effects were achieved ) ; and finally , ' Shanghai Lil ' - a fitting tribute to the talents of both Cagney & Berkeley .
437903	306861	28401	10.0	Excellent Golden Era Film	' In the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia , on THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE , ' a young woman discovers love , but no respite from the violent feud which has torn apart two families . Full of good performances & boasting excellent production values courtesy of Paramount Studios , this fine drama brings to its viewers a not-so-subtle message of peace & tolerance . The vividly depicted consequences of mindless , violent behavior give the film a real punch . The film's romantic triangle consists of barefoot mountain lass Sylvia Sidney , her decent , uncomplicated cousin Henry Fonda , and mining executive Fred MacMurray , who , as a newcomer to the backwoods , rebels against the traditions of violence & revenge he finds there . All three deliver compelling performances , with a slight advantage going to the gentlemen , as their roles do not require as much shrill , fickle behavior as does Miss Sidney's . The marvelous character actress Beulah Bondi appears as Miss Sidney's mother , one of the first in a decades-long line of stubborn , proud old women she would play ; her eyes tell of the world of trouble her character has seen on the mountain . Cuddly Nigel Bruce is MacMurray's associate - gruff & grumbly , but with a heart of gold . Special mention should be made of seven-year-old Spanky McFarland , who plays Miss Sidney's little brother . Already the star of numerous OUR GANG comedies , the tiny tyke here displays the talent that placed him in the front rank of child movie stars . Precocious & poignant , Spanky's character is quite unforgettable . Fred Stone & Robert Barrat play the heads of the two feuding clans , one gentle - the other fierce . Movie mavens will recognize Clara Blandick as a frightened landlady and Samuel S . Hinds as the Gaptown sheriff . The film is stitched together by the evocative , nostalgic singing of Fuzzy Knight , who introduces ? Twilight On The Trail ' & ? A Melody From The Sky , ' ( both by Louis Alter and Sidney D . Mitchell ) . The tune for the chorus of ? The Trail Of The Lonesome Pine , ' by Ballard MacDonald & Harry Carroll , can be briefly heard during the opening credits ; viewers will need to watch Laurel & Hardy's WAY OUT WEST ( 1937 ) to hear this fine old song actually sung . Famous as the first outdoor film produced in full Technicolor , THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE benefits greatly from its location filming near Cedar Lake , in California's San Bernardino Mountains .
438183	306861	39025	10.0	A Fond Look Back	A Warner Bros . Short Subject . An elderly gentleman tells his granddaughter about THOSE GOOD OLD DAYS of vaudeville . William T . Orr energetically performs his way through three sprightly musical numbers which illustrate a typical song-and-dance man's routine in the glory days of vaudeville . This pleasant little film was helmed by Jean Negulesco , later a celebrated director . Notice the mention of television in the script . It greatly threatened the popularity of movies & radio , which had themselves been the cause of the demise of vaudeville . The reference is also ironic in that Mr . Orr would eventually become an important & talented executive producer in the new medium , responsible for many successful TV shows . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios ' feature films .
437806	306861	17437	10.0	Mr . Langdon Brings Down The House	A shy young Belgian immigrate searches for the American girl who wrote of her love to him during the Great War . Director Frank Capra and clown Harry Langdon together fashioned THE STRONG MAN , one of the finest comedies of the Silent Era . Moving the action from No Man's Land in Western Europe , to Ellis Island and the hectic streets of New York , and finally to the temporarily corrupted village of Cloverdale , Capra & Langdon expertly mix belly laughs with scenes of great emotional tenderness . If either of them had never made another film , this one would have been enough to have ensured each a footnote in movie history . Langdon's minimalist style is highlighted in a series of vignettes which perfectly captures his unique adult baby persona : Harry's hilarious encounter with Broadway Lily , which includes his classic up-the-stairs-backward routine ; Harry's finding of blind Mary Brown and the incredibly poignant way in which he immediately falls in love with her ; Langdon's hapless impersonation of The Strong Man and his single-handed battle against a saloon full of bad guys . A sturdy cast gives able support : Gertrude Astor as dangerous Lily ; saintly William V . Mong as Holy Joe , the Cloverdale minister ; Priscilla Bonner as sweet Mary ; beefy Arthur Thalasso as The Great Zandow ; Robert McKim as Cloverdale's wicked criminal boss ; and Brooks Benedict as a tough passenger encountered by Harry on a bus . A quick caricature of Harry , dressed in his policeman's uniform from the end of the movie , appears courtesy of Walt Disney at the beginning of the animated MICKEY'S GALA PREMIER ( 1933 ) .
438047	306861	21806	10.0	Tears & Laughter With The Little Rascals	An OUR GANG Comedy Short . Living with their wicked stepmother , Wheezer & Dorothy discover that DOGS IS DOGS when the evil woman threatens Pete , but protects nasty Sherwood's pedigreed Nero . Things start to move fast , however , when Sherwood falls down a well & Pete is accused of killing the neighbor's chickens . A very good little film , with equal measures of comedy & tears . It's difficult to watch Wheezer being beaten . Standout performance from the inimitable Stymie . Highlight : Stymie's ham & eggs story . That's Billy Gilbert as the crazed neighbor with the gun .
437078	306861	23990	10.0	Frozen North Comes Alive In Forgotten Documentary	The arrival of White Men in Arctic Canada challenges the freedom of a fearless ESKIMO hunter . W . S . Van Dyke , MGM's peripatetic director , was responsible for this fascinating look at life in the Arctic among the Inuit . His production was on location filming from April 1932 until November 1933 ( although some annoying rear projection effects show that some of the shooting took place back at the Studio ) . While considered a documentary at the time , we would likely term it a ' docudrama ' as it is scripted with an intriguing plot & storyline . The film shows the daily life of the Eskimo , both Winter & Summer , and in fact starts in the warmer time of the year without any snow or ice in sight . The constant striving for food is depicted , and the viewer gets to watch the exciting hunts for walrus , polar bear , whale & caribou . The native language is used throughout , with the use of title cards ; the only English is spoken by the fishermen & Mounties encountered by the Eskimo . In fact , it is the arrival of White Men , both good & bad , and the change they make on Eskimo society , which is a major element in the narrative . This Pre-Code film deals in a refreshingly frank manner with the Eskimo moral code , particularly with their practice of wife-sharing , which was an important and completely innocent part of their culture . In fact , the entire film can be appreciated as a valuable look at a way of life which was rapidly disappearing even in the early 1930's . None of the cast receives screen credit , which is a shame as there are some notable performances . Foremost among them is that of Ray Wise , playing the leading role of Mala the Eskimo . Wise ( 1906-1952 ) was an Alaskan Native of Inuit ancestry and is absolutely splendid and perfectly believable in what was a very demanding part . As handsome as any Hollywood star , he would continue acting , using the name of Ray Mala , in a sporadic film career , often in tiny unbilled roles . Lovely Japanese-Hawaiian actress Lotus Long plays Mala's loyal second wife ; the names of the fine actresses playing his other two wives are now obscure . Director Woody Van Dyke steps in front of the cameras as a strict North West Mounted Police inspector . The two decent-hearted Mounties who must deliver Mala to Canadian justice are played by Joe Sawyer & Edgar Dearing , both longtime movie character actors . Danish author Peter Freuchen , upon whose books the film was based , has a short vivid role of an evil wooden-legged sea captain who unwisely rouses Mala's icy wrath .
437021	306861	28390	10.0	Disney's Tortoise Versus Hare , Round Two	A Walt Disney SILLY SYMPHONY Cartoon Short . TOBY TORTOISE RETURNS to compete once more with Max Hare , this time in the boxing ring . What's needed now is some fancy footwork , but all Toby has to offer is ' slow and steady ' . . . This little film , a follow-up to THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE ( 1935 ) , is enjoyable & entertaining , but not on the same stylistic level as its Oscar-winning predecessor . Several characters from other SILLY SYMPHONIES make cameo appearances , including the Three Little Pigs and Jenny Wren . The SILLY SYMPHONIES , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most fascinating of all animated series . Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount , with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music . There was little plot in the early Symphonies , which featured lively inanimate objects and anthropomorphic plants & animals , all moving frantically to the soundtrack . Gradually , however , the Symphonies became the school where Walt's animators learned to work with color and began to experiment with plot , characterization & photographic special effects . The pages of Fable & Fairy Tale , Myth & Mother Goose were all mined to provide story lines and even Hollywood's musicals & celebrities were effectively spoofed . It was from this rich soil that Disney's feature-length animation was to spring . In 1939 , with SNOW WHITE successfully behind him and PINOCCHIO & FANTASIA on the near horizon , Walt phased out the SILLY SYMPHONIES ; they had run their course & served their purpose .
438313	306861	213622	10.0	Do We Hear Wedding Bells ?	An MGM PETE SMITH SPECIALITY Short Subject . While THE DOMINEERING MALE may think the romantic initiative is all his , it's often the female who's doing the real conniving . This bit of typical Pete Smith zaniness takes a humorously cynical look at a wily woman's for-profit relationship with the man she intends to marry . The poor sap probably doesn't stand a chance . . . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera .

Peter Ravitch , a gentle soul from a small Yugoslav town , writes a poignant letter TO MY UNBORN SON as he lies dying from a Nazi bullet . This true-life story of courage against the Nazi oppressor features a reading of Peter's remarkable letter , in which he hopes for a peaceful world full of boundless opportunity & joy for his son . The film is a good example of MGM's mastery of the short subject format . After Pearl Harbor , Hollywood went to war totally against the Axis . Not only did many of the stars join up or do home front service , but the output of the Studios was largely turned to the war effort . The newsreels , of course , brought the latest war news into the neighborhood theater every week . The features showcased battle stories or war related themes . Even the short subjects & cartoons were used as a quick means of spreading Allied propaganda , the boosting of morale or information dissemination . Together , Uncle Sam , the American People & Hollywood proved to be an unbeatable combination . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel .

437461	306861	21746	10.0	Epic Frontier Film	A charismatic Kansas lawyer takes his bride to the Oklahoma Territory's CIMARRON Country to start a newspaper in the violent , rawboned town of Osage . Edna Ferber's sprawling novel of frontier life comes to the big screen in a film deemed fine enough to win a few Oscars , including Best Picture . It was one of the first great epics of the Sound Era and is still very entertaining to watch . Occasionally there is a bit of overacting , perhaps , and technical difficulties with the microphones can be discerned while trying to hear the stars ' voices clearly during some crowd scenes , but this in no way detracts from the enjoyment of viewing the film . The performance of Richard Dix as pioneer & dreamer Yancey Cravat has been criticized as being too florid and overripe , but this is unfair . The popular actor had his roots in silent films when acting techniques were somewhat different , but this robust style perfectly suits the energetic wanderlust of his character . Anything less than abundant enthusiasm would look silly in a fellow called upon to deliver a sermon and shoot an outlaw almost simultaneously , vigorously champion the rights of fallen women and racial minorities and yet still blithely abandon his family for long years as he follows his own star of destiny . Call it what you may , Dix's performance can certainly never be tagged as being dull . Irene Dunne , as Yancey's wife Sabra - his ? Sugar ' - provides the calm emotional center for the film . She is the one who holds the family and newspaper together while her husband is off bringing civilization to other frontiers . She is even able to achieve substantial business and political importance . What saves Dunne's performance from becoming too sweet is the story giving her a few personality wrinkles to deal with , most notably her determination to destroy the town's bawdy house madam ( well played by Estelle Taylor ) and her intense bigotry towards the local Indians . Her growth as a human being is juxtaposed with that of Oklahoma's expansion as a state . Some fine character actors provide prime entertainment value : stuttering Roscoe Ates as the Cravats ' faithful printer ; George E . Stone as a gentle Jewish peddler who becomes a firm family friend ; Stanley Fields as a town tough who tangles with the wrong hombre ; William Collier Jr in a brief , vibrant outlaw role as The Kid ; and Eugene Jackson as the young Black servant who gives the ultimate sacrifice of loyalty to the Cravats . Marvelous gossipy Edna May Oliver , replete with snooty sniffs & piercing glances , neatly tucks all her scenes as a society matron into her handbag and stalks off with them . With production costs of 1 . 5 million dollars , RKO could give CIMARRON excellent production values , featuring crowds of extras and very realistic sets . A few of the scenes are classics and remain in the mind for a long time : the 1889 Land Rush sequence which opens the film ; the church service in the saloon ; the gun battle in the dusty street . It is very interesting to watch how the town of Osage changes during the movie , from a dangerous dirty settlement to an Oklahoma metropolis in 1930 , all achieved most convincingly for the screen . The Cimarron is a wild & unruly river that arises in New Mexico and runs for about 600 miles before becoming a tributary of the Arkansas River near Tulsa , Oklahoma . The word is Old Spanish and refers to the thickets along the River and the bighorn sheep which inhabited them
437732	306861	21752	10.0	Disney Takes A Tick Tock Tour	A Walt Disney SILLY SYMPHONY Cartoon Short . With the coming on night , the denizens of THE CLOCK STORE all awake to dance & sway & pirouette to their rhythmical music . There is virtually no plot in this little black & white film , until the boxing alarm clocks start their fisticuffs at the climax . The cartoon boasts a lovely opening scene , however , with the old lamplighter moving along the block , dispelling shadows . This one sequence hints at the quality Disney would display in later years .

437252	306861	19811	10.0	The End Of The Beginning For John Gilbert	Kidnapped by jewel thieves , the manager of a British diamond mining operation in Africa spends long DESERT NIGHTS plotting his escape . . . John Gilbert is most enjoyable in this lively yarn , his last starring performance in a silent film ( he would appear in the William Haines ' picture A MAN'S MAN , which was released a few months after DESERT NIGHTS , but that was in a cameo role as himself ) . His verve & vitality propel the ( sometimes silly ) plot and make the movie into a very enjoyable action picture . Ernest Torrence - in a fine portrayal - makes a florid , hammy villain . Beautiful Mary Nolan enacts the sort of woman any red-blooded male viewer would gladly walk the Kalahari to gain . By 1929 silent films were truly an art form in their own right . ( Witness the piano sequence early in the picture , with Gilbert & Nolan waltzing on the porch , to see the kind of nuance possible in this not-so-silent medium . ) MGM was at the apex of the industry & Jack Gilbert was the Studio's greatest male star . Which is what makes DESERT NIGHTS so poignant . Before the year ended silent cinema , that most emotionally penetrating of all the photo dramas , would be dead & Gilbert's career would be dying . A new crop of stars would be on the rise & Noise would be king .
437040	306861	19815	10.0	Early Talkie A Triumph For Mr . Ramon Novarro	Fleeing for his life , a young Bonapartist with a DEVIL-MAY-CARE attitude discovers romantic complications after hiding in the boudoir of a lovely young lady . Ramon Novarro made his all-talking picture debut in this romantic comedy , one of Hollywood's very first musicals . MGM's Mexican star adds another role to his long list of ethnic portrayals , this time as a Frenchman . Knowing he had made the successful transition from silents to talkies , he seems to be having a great time with the swashbuckling antics of his character . Exhibiting a considerable amount of mischievous charm , he completely dominates the entire picture . It is important to remember that this was an extremely early talkie , yet director Sidney Franklin and sound artist Douglas Shearer prove more than capable of tackling the difficulties with the microphone . Indeed , there are times , particularly during the musical scenes , when one is beguiled into believing that sound production provided no impediments whatsoever , so smoothly do the scenes flow . Surely this was an indication of considerable talent behind the camera . Kudos should also go to cinematographer Merriitt B . Gerstad , who makes beautiful use of shadows , showing the power of black & white photography . This is even further highlighted by the inclusion of one scene filmed in early Technicolor , near the end of the picture . Novarro's singing voice had been a significant success earlier in 1929 in THE PAGAN . In DEVIL-MAY-CARE he seems to be crooning most of the time , doing full justice to a series of songs by Herbert Stothart & Clifford Grey . Dorothy Jordan & Marion Harris play the cousins who figure so prominently in Novarro's life . Both are comely and their non-Gaelic accents only occasionally intrude upon their performances . John Miljan is enjoyable as the comic Royalist who pursues Novarro . Movie mavens will recognize an uncredited Lionel Belmore as an inebriated Innkeeper . Historically speaking , our young hero's elation at the return of the Emperor Napoleon in March of 1815 , from 10-month's exile on the island of Elba , was doomed to be short-lived . Although thousands flocked to join him during his triumphal march to Paris , Napoleon's Hundred Days of glory came to an end on the battlefield of Waterloo , on June 18 , 1815 , with utter and irreversible defeat at the hands of the British & Prussians . On July 15 , 1815 , Napoleon's second exile began , this time on the tiny South Atlantic isle of St . Helena . There would be no further escape . Abandoned & alone , Napoleon Bonaparte died on May 5 , 1821 , very possibly as a result of arsenic poisoning .
438278	306861	23612	10.0	Mickey Mouse - Gridiron Hero	A Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE Cartoon . It's up to TOUCHDOWN MICKEY to win the important football game played against the brutish Alley Cats . Although virtually without plot ( and spoofing the silent pigskin films of Harold Lloyd , Buster Keaton & William Haines ) this is a very fine example of the sort of cartoon Mickey made in his early black & white days . Minnie , Goofy & Pluto all make prominent appearances , but the attentive viewer should also spot Horace Horsecollar & Clarabelle Cow among the enthusiastic supporters for Mickey's Manglers . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Bambi , Peter Pan and Mr . Toad . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
437046	306861	26605	10.0	Pompeii , Pageantry & Pontius Pilate	Conscious stricken after abandoning Christ on the way to Golgotha , a jaded slave trader witnesses THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII , and the city's horrific destruction . Although burdened with occasional wooden acting , this is generally a fine historical drama . RKO spent quite a bit of money on its production and it shows in the large crowd scenes and still noteworthy special effects . The film boasted a very fine team behind the camera , working together as they had on KING KONG ( 1933 ) . Directorial duties were shared by Ernest B . Schoedsack & Meriam C . Cooper . Special effects wizard Willis O'Brien worked his magic , while composer Max Steiner contributed a pounding score . Preston Foster had one of his finest roles as the stalwart blacksmith turned gladiator and slaver . His performance during the prolonged climax , while desperately trying to save the life of his doomed son , is especially effective . David Holt & John Wood , playing the youth at different ages , are also very good . Additional fine support is offered by Alan Hale as the rough mercenary who teams with Foster ; and by villainous Louis Calhern as Pompeii's last prefect . Acting honors , however , go to marvelous Basil Rathbone , who gives a most sophisticated performance as Pontius Pilate , by turns rogue , fate's victim & moral philosopher . Movie mavens should recognize Ward Bond as a boastful gladiator , elderly Zeffie Tilbury as a soothsayer , Edward Van Sloan as Pilate's clerk & Edwin Maxwell as a Pompeii official , all uncredited . The film makes rather a mishmash of historical chronology . Young Flavius appears to be about ten years old at the time of Christ's crucifixion , which occurred around AD 29 . It would be another fifty years - August 24 , AD 79 , to be precise - until Vesuvius ' eruption destroyed Pompeii , yet Flavius is still depicted as a youthful fellow , just reaching maturity . Early Christian tradition also holds that Pilate committed suicide in AD 39 - four decades before Pompeii's rendezvous with destiny . While using the same title & location , this film tells quite a different story from that of the classic 1834 novel by Baron Bulwer-Lytton .

This is an enjoyable little film , despite the fact that Disney used the same basic plot - Donald versus a tiny creature - many times . Buzz-Buzz appeared in seven Disney cartoons - much to Donald's intense discomfiture - from 1948 until 1952 . Clarence " Ducky " Nash supplies Donald's voice .

Comic Joe E . Brown has a wonderful time , striding about Manhattan in a ten-gallon hat & boots , packing a pair of six-shooters and carrying a lasso . No hick he , shysters of both sexes find he's not an easy mark - - until he's taken in by a couple of desperate play producers who want to unload 49 % of their latest flop . Brown is a constant wide-mouthed delight , whether roping his luggage at Grand Central Terminal , trying to be neighborly to a bunch of chorus boy cowboys , or galloping after a group of taxi-driven gangsters on a busy New York street , he makes this rather naughty Pre-Code comedy boil . Perky Ginger Rogers scores as a secretary honest enough to want to protect Joe and his money . Lew Cody & Robert Greig ooze false charm as the producers ( Greig even looks a little like the great Mostel ) and brassy Vivien Oakland stirs things up a bit as the play's spoiled star . Movie mavens will recognize Herman Bing as an opinionated chef , Nat Pendleton as a jealous husband and Richard Cramer as a gangster , all three uncredited . The last few seconds of the film , involving some very peculiar triplets , is hilarious .
437984	306861	23778	10.0	Up The Nile & Across The Desert With Novarro & Loy	Kidnapped in the Egyptian desert , a beautiful American finds herself alternately loving & loathing THE BARBARIAN who abducted her . Taken solely as romantic adventure , this lavish little MGM film has much to offer , including good acting & fine production values . Considered only from the standpoint of the plot , the story is ludicrous , what with a heroine suffering histrionics among the sand dunes & a hero who is a completely unprincipled cad . Ramon Novarro does well in the title role , a reprise of his silent film THE ARAB ( 1924 ) . MGM's Mexican star adds yet another ethnic stripe to his thespian escutcheon , this time portraying an Egyptian prince . Looking a little like a Valentino clone , he gets to sing & act in a variety of languages . Myrna Loy , who only gets billing below the title , is excellent as the Englishwoman caught-up in the allures & entrapments of the Nile Desert . After paying her dues in roles like this , she would very soon become a major Hollywood movie star . In the very able supporting cast Reginald Denny plays Loy's stuffy fiancé ; Edward Arnold is an unctuous pasha ; Hedda Hopper appears briefly as an American tourist very pleased with Novarro's attentions . Wonderful old Sir C . Aubrey Smith is well cast as Loy's eccentric uncle and elderly , tart-tongued Louise Closser Hale steals every scene she's in as Loy's peppery companion . This film is definitely pre-Production Code vintage , a fact made plainly obvious by Loy's lounge-in-the-tub scene . Considered rationally , many of THE BARBARIAN's implications are rather disturbing . That Loy could only be happy with the man who has humiliated , beaten , abused & raped her are decidedly unwholesome ideas to come from the pen of screenwriter - and liberated woman - Anita Loos . Novarro sings ' Love Songs of the Nile ' quite well , but interminably . If it sounds suspiciously like his previous ' Pagan Love Song ' hit , it may be because the two songs share the same composers , Nacio Herb Brown & Arthur Freed .
437385	306861	128314	10.0	Scenes & Views In Old London Town	An MGM TRAVELTALK Short Subject . While LOOKING AT LONDON in this little film we are shown some of the major sights of this mighty capital : Buckingham Palace , the Bank of England , Trafalgar Square , Piccadilly Circus . After gazing at bomb damage left from the Blitz , we are left to contemplate majestic St . Paul's Cathedral . This is one of a large series of succinct travelogues turned out by MGM , beginning in the 1930's . They featured Technicolor views of beautiful & unusual sights around the globe , as well as vivid , concise commentary . These films were produced & narrated by James A . FitzPatrick .
437224	306861	14972	10.0	Another Master Class From Mr . Lon Chaney	A celebrated circus clown , HE Who Gets Slapped , plots the punishment of two evil aristocrats . Lon Chaney , the Silent Screen's master chameleon , adds another portrait to his gallery of pathetic grotesques . This time he plays a scientist who becomes a clown after his former life is destroyed by his adulterous wife and a faithless friend . A young woman provides him with someone to secretly adore , until her wicked father threatens to ruin her happiness . Chaney's face is an absolute wonder to watch as it registers pain , anguish , distress and unrequited passion , underlining the modern reassessment of him as one of cinema's greatest actors . Uninhibited in his circus costume & makeup , he provides no doubt but that he , under different circumstances , could have become a marvelous big top clown . This was the first release of the new film company merger Metro-Goldwyn , thus making Chaney their first star , and was an important rung up the ladder for the two performers playing the young lovers . Norma Shearer & John Gilbert would soon be major movie celebrities - - here they give good account of themselves as the circus ' daredevil & bareback riders , and as Chaney's truest friends ( both unaware of his love for Miss Shearer ) . In a film full of circus excitement , the director has given the young couple a moment of unexpected beauty : whilst on a picnic their innocent affections are noticed by a passing peasant , who gives the call of the cuckoo as the perfect grace note to their bucolic joy . Marc McDermott as a brutal Baron and Tully Marshall as a dissolute Count make villains well worthy of the harshest retribution . Comic Ford Sterling plays one of Chaney's fellow clowns . The Studio gave this silent film fine production values , while director Victor Sjöström added little embellishments of cinematic flair , dealing with scenes of mysterious clown figures representing fate , which enhance the film .
437815	306861	23744	10.0	Forgotten Pre-Code Gem	A brawling roughneck and a timid wimp are both whipped into shape by AGGIE APPLEBY MAKER OF MEN . This refreshingly forthright & honest look at a Depression-era New York City female and her two problem men is a delight from start to finish . Elements both comic and tender are blended together into a very satisfying package which , whatever the situation , rings true every time . Wynne Gibson gives a remarkably unaffected performance - - bold , brassy , bossy , but also unfailingly decent & loving . She doesn't waste time with either regrets or excuses , but gets on with her tough life , helping others whenever she can . Charles Farrell , a major box office star in the early 1930's , is excellent as the diffident young fellow who changes his entire persona , thanks to Miss Gibson's efforts . Farrell lets us see how vulnerable his character still is , even after assuming his new attitude . The short scene in which he is attacked by a bully is actually painful to watch . William Gargan epitomizes the kind of loudmouthed bruiser who's actually a softy when it comes to his girl . Wispy & almost ethereal , the enormously talented ZaSu Pitts plays the cleaning lady friend of Miss Gibson . Future consumer advocate Betty Furness portrays Farrell's surprisingly liberated hometown girlfriend , while Blanche Frederici appears as his rather frightful aunt . Movie mavens will recognize an unbilled Jane Darwell as Miss Gibson's practical landlady .
438060	306861	21556	10.0	Disney's Salute To The Seasons , Opus Four	A Walt Disney SILLY SYMPHONY Cartoon Short . It is WINTER , and when not braving the icy winds the forest animals are gliding on the ice . They don't neglect their trip to Mr . Groundhog , though , to get a forecast of the coming weather . . . More action / reaction animation in this black & white cartoon . Also more posterior gags , in dubious taste , from the Disney animators . The bear cub having a face almost identical to Mickey Mouse was probably no accident . The SILLY SYMPHONIES , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most interesting of series in the field of animation . Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount , with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music . There was little plot in the early Symphonies , which featured lively inanimate objects and anthropomorphic plants & animals , all moving frantically to the soundtrack . Gradually , however , the Symphonies became the school where Walt's animators learned to work with color and began to experiment with plot , characterization & photographic special effects . The pages of Fable & Fairy Tale , Myth & Mother Goose were all mined to provide story lines and even Hollywood's musicals & celebrities were effectively spoofed . It was from this rich soil that Disney's feature-length animation was to spring . In 1939 , with SNOW WHITE successfully behind him and PINOCCHIO & FANTASIA on the near horizon , Walt phased out the SILLY SYMPHONIES ; they had run their course & served their purpose .

But McMorehouse the customer , a parsimonious old Scot , refuses to pay the extra four cents and abandons the animals to Flannery's care . And then the guinea piglets start to arrive . . . The Disney version of Ellias Parker Butler's humorous little story makes for an enjoyable cartoon . It is presented in the limited-animation style so popular in the 1950's .

The wonderful old poem by Clement C . Moore comes to life in this little silent film . Looking like a Victorian Christmas card , it has all the charm of a bygone era . The special effects , especially the scenic diorama used for St . Nicholas ' ride , are quite effective . Al Kryszak provided the score for the video compilation A Christmas Past , in which this film appears .

And through all the trials & tribulations about to beset him , he remains true to his duty & to his love . From the splendid Rabbit Ears series of videos , this is a very lovely adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen classic which is sure to charm any thoughtful or romantic viewer . The story , which like all truly great children's literature is best understood by adults , can be enjoyed on more than one level . David Jorgensen's misty drawings & Mark Isham's martial music complement the narrative exactly . Jeremy Irons is the perfect choice for narrator . His calm , rich voice tells the tale in all its beautiful simplicity , from beginning to heartbreaking end .

Another tale from the Just So Stories , Rudyard Kipling's sly spoof of evolutionary theory , is brought to vibrant life by the folks at Rabbit Ears .

437395	306861	24440	10.0	Beasts Run Wild	A Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE Cartoon . It only takes a few moments for THE PET STORE to be turned into a complete shambles by its new employee - Mickey Mouse . This funny little black & white film has a plot that's largely driven by its music : Mickey , Minnie and the entire menagerie dance around frantically to the soundtrack until the climax , which has a nice spoof of that year's KING KONG ( 1933 ) . Tony , the store owner , seems a very decent fellow , but apparently one encounter with the Mouse was enough - he never appeared in another Disney cartoon . Walt Disney supplied Mickey with his squeaky voice . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a storm of naysayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that childlike simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
438274	306861	53080	10.0	Animated Charmer	Two little boys go for a secret nighttime adventure and have an encounter with a MOONBIRD . This absolutely charming little film is based on the ( apparently ) unscripted dialogue between two young brothers , Mark & Hampy Hubley . Created & designed by their parents , John & Faith Hubley , the effervescent quality of the conversation is matched by the limited-animation format which takes the simple story into flights of fancy . Winner of the 1959 Oscar for Best Animated Short .
437344	306861	27726	10.0	Some Sweet Romance	With their HEARTS DIVIDED by international politics , can a pretty American girl and the brother of the great Napoleon ever find true happiness ? This good-natured romance film has been rather harshly criticized as being bad history , which it is , instead of being appreciated for its simple aim to provide some escapist amusement in the form of a lavish movie starring Marion Davies . In this it succeeds . William Randolph Hearst , Davies ' powerful lover , saw to that , and what Hearst wanted he generally got . Although the plot is exceedingly silly at times , the film is still a pleasant entertainment . At 39 , Davies was too old for the part ( and older than her costar by seven years ) , but Hearst liked seeing her in the crinoline & lace roles , and she had little control of the matter . However , as was her custom , Marion charms the viewer with her buoyant spirits , willingness to please and genuine acting skills . She's more than able to hold her own with a talented supporting cast and appears quite happy to be in the arms of young Dick Powell . For his part , Powell needs do little more than exude boyish charm and sing a few times to cover his acting requirements quite nicely . As Napoleon , the great Claude Rains steals every scene he's in by very quietly underplaying his acting and only hinting at the tremendous power his character wields . Fascinating to watch even under heavy makeup , Rains makes a quality contribution to the film . The movie's humor is largely handled by a trio of excellent character actors . Droll Arthur Treacher , suspicious Edward Everett Horton & grumpy Charles Ruggles play Marion's erstwhile suitors . Constantly trying to upstage each other , their dialogue provides plenty of chuckles . Even in minor casting the film excels . Dignified Henry Stephenson and sharp-tongued Clara Blandick play Marion's father and aunt . Walter Kingsford & diminutive Etienne Girardot play the French officials assigned to keep an eye on Mr . Powell . Halliwell Hobbes lends gravity to his small role as Napoleon's Second Consul . Beulah Bondi brightens her single scene as the Bonaparte boys ' kindhearted mother . And the magnificent Hall Johnson Choir appears to lift its voice in song for a few moments . Time has not dealt kindly with Marion Davies . Almost forgotten today , when remembered at all it is usually as a sort of footnote to history or object of scandal . Her life certainly was colorful , and as chatelaine of America's most amazing private estate she did circulate amidst powerful circles . But to remember her as the bimbo blonde mistress of the country's mightiest media baron is patently unfair . While much of the blame can go to Orson Welles ' spoof of Davies in CITIZEN KANE ( which he was to admit he regretted towards the end of his life ) it must be stated emphatically that Marion was not a no-talent actress with few friends & even fewer brains , whose career was destroyed by her stammer leaving her to spend lonely years in great , hulking empty castles . In reality , Davies was a bright , vivacious lady who charmed & captivated such diverse guests as George Bernard Shaw & Winston Churchill throughout her 33-year liaison with Hearst . Adored by her friends and a fierce cadre of fans , Davies was renowned for her tireless generosity and charitable good works . Her speech impediment never affected her screen acting and her undeniable talent was evident to any who were willing to assess her performances honesty and look past the scandal . Davies had to have been embarrassed by the Hearst empire's relentless pushing of her career . She knew this left her open to ridicule & mockery , doubtless contributing to her scarcely concealed alcoholism . But she eventually relinquished her film pursuits in order to care for the aging Hearst , and after his death in 1951 she showed herself to be an astute businesswoman during the remaining ten years of her life . It is only now , with the passage of much time & the restoration of her old movies , that it is becoming easier to acknowledge the contributions & cinematic expertise of Marion Davies . Jérôme Bonaparte ( 1784-1860 ) was only 16 when he entered the service of Napoleon as a member of the Consular Guard . After being wounded in a duel he transferred to the French Navy . Leaving his ship in the West Indies , he entered the United States , ( Jérôme was not involved in the sale of the Louisiana Purchase to America ) where he fell in love with Elizabeth Patterson of Baltimore , Maryland . They were married on Christmas Eve , 1803 . After returning to Europe with his wife in 1805 , it was discovered that Napoleon had annulled the marriage and forbade Elizabeth to enter any of his domains . This decision was absolutely determinate . Elizabeth was returned to America and Jérôme was married to Princess Catherine of Württemberg and subsequently proclaimed King of Westphalia in 1807 , which included a wide territory east of the Rhine in addition to the former province of Westphalia . He abdicated in 1813 when Napoleon's powers began to decline , but he continued to serve as a loyal officer fighting for his brother until the Battle of Waterloo brought total defeat in 1815 . Jérôme then retired into self-exile and did not return to France until 1847 , when he entered the service of his nephew Napoleon III , the son of his brother Louis . Jérôme would eventually serve as Governor of the Invalides , Marshal of France & President of the Senate .
438127	306861	43421	10.0	Drumsticks For Two	A Walt Disney PLUTO Cartoon . All Pluto & Milton the cat can think about is the COLD TURKEY sitting unguarded in the refrigerator . Milton and Pluto make a fine partnership in this funny little film , rather like a silent movie comedy team . However , Milton only appeared in a tiny handful of Disney cartoons before disappearing from the screen . The spoof of old-time TV wrestling and food commercials is especially humorous . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle .

437536	306861	19993	10.0	We Speak ! We Sing ! And We Sometimes Act Badly !	THE Hollywood REVUE OF 1929 allows some important Silent stars to exercise their vocal chords . Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , Hollywood's mightiest film studio , bowed to the inevitability of sound with this cinematic variety show which highlighted performances from most of their top talent . ( Conspicuous by their absence are Garbo , Chaney & Novarro , each of whom would make their talkie debut elsewhere . ) Like all the other studios , it was vitally important for box-office reasons that MGM establish the viability of their top performers in the new medium , even though some of those appearing here would find their film careers swept away almost immediately . This should be looked on as a representative of its time . Much of the humor is now flat and a few of the performances sag badly , but it should be remembered that this is a cinematic collection of scared individuals , desperate to make good in the frightening new world of talk . Naturally , MGM's own in-house composers are heavily relied upon in the film , with the tunes of Nacio Herb Brown & Arthur Freed and Joe Goodwin & Gus Edwards much in evidence . Highlights include songs by Marie Dressler , a dance by Buster Keaton and Cliff Edwards ' " Singing in the Rain . "
437094	306861	33626	10.0	The Legacy Of Bob Mitchell	A Warner Bros . Short Subject . The Robert Mitchell Choir School of Hollywood , California , provides a solid education for talented boys from ages 8 to 14 , giving them the chance to perform and excel academically & musically . Nominated for an Academy Award , FORTY BOYS AND A SONG is an informative & highly entertaining little film which spotlights a premiere American musical institution from years past . We watch the young fellows in the classroom , at play and at church . Always , music is being taught , performed & enjoyed and we get to hear the boys ' renditions of " Home On the Range , " " My Bonnie Lies Over The Ocean " & " Shortenin ' Bread . " Born October 12 , 1912 , Bob Mitchell showed an acute aptitude & appreciation of music at a very early age . In 1924 , when still only 12 , Bob started playing organ accompaniment to silent films , beginning a passion for silent cinema music that would last a lifetime . In the 1930's he started his Boys Choir , which gained much success ; the Mitchell Singing Boys would appear in scores of films , most notably GOING MY WAY ( 1944 ) with Bing Crosby . On his 90th birthday in 2002 , Bob Mitchell was still keeping very busy playing the organ for church and weddings , personal appearances and silent films - delighting new audiences with his gift of music . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios ' feature films .

We begin our cinematic tour IN THE VALLEY OF THE RHINE with a stop in Cologne for a look at the mighty Cathedral . Then it is on to Bonn , where we are shown the birthplace of Beethoven . In Koblenz we are taken to a lively wine garden to watch the dancing & hear the orchestra . Finally , we arrive at the most famous & romantic stretch of the river - where the steep hills crowd in close to the water .

After seeing several castles , we end our short tour near the rock of the Lorelei , where Teutonic legend & the music of Richard Wagner hold sway . This is one of a large series of succinct travelogues turned out by MGM , beginning in the 1930's . They featured Technicolor views of beautiful & unusual sights around the globe , as well as vivid , concise commentary . These films were produced & narrated by James A . FitzPatrick .
437532	306861	32080	10.0	Westward With Mr . DeMille & The Railroad	Moving across the American wilderness , east to west , the mighty UNION PACIFIC Railroad stretches to meet its rival - the Central Pacific - taming a continent with steel rails . Overcoming Nature's disasters , hostile natives & corrupt politicians , the engines bring with them the people whose hopes are inextricably tied into the railroad's success or failure . In 1939 , Hollywood's Golden Year , kingpin director Cecil B . DeMille presented his biggest , flashiest film yet . It was to be nothing less than the story of how the American West was conquered by the great railroads & her indomitable builders . To realize DeMille's vision on the screen , Paramount allocated hundreds of extras & large coffers of money to the project . Authentic rolling stock was acquired . The president of the contemporary Union Pacific enthusiastically sent his finest track layers to work in the film . The movie would boost train wrecks ( two of ? em ) , Indian attacks , assorted villainies & a compelling love triangle . DeMille demanded scrupulous attention to detail and his crowd scenes are very well conceived & produced . His early reels tend to be a bit preachy in touting the virtues of the railroad , but action scenes quickly follow which amply compensate for this . DeMille's subject matter & obvious patriotism help him to avoid the lapses of taste & vulgarities in which he tended to stray in many of his other film forays . Even with a fake Irish brogue , Barbara Stanwyck charms in her role as a railroad postmistress & engineer's daughter . Feisty & volatile , always great fun to watch , it's easy to see why she's loved by both Joel McCrea ( the hero ) & Robert Preston ( the antihero ) . Both gentlemen give good rousing performances in roles that might have strayed into the stereotypical , but never do . Brian Donlevy , as the villain , gives another vivid portrait in what is rather a small role , but very much like the one he would play that same year in DESTRY RIDES AGAIN . Akim Tamiroff & Lynne Overman are especially enjoyable as McCrea's scruffy , rather repulsive security enforcers ; with whip & guns , these are two hombres you wouldn't want to tangle with . Robert Barrat as a murdering bully & Regis Toomey as a sweet-natured Irish worker , give impressive cameos . Anthony Quinn appears for a couple of scenes as a gambler who unwisely pulls a gun on McCrea , and lovely Evelyn Keyes has a scant few screen moments as a telegrapher's wife . Sharp-eyed movie mavens may ( or may not ) be able to spot among the uncredited players Monte Blue , Ward Bond , Iron Eyes Cody , Will Geer , Noble Johnson , Elmo Lincoln & Mala playing various Indians , gamblers or railwaymen . It would be most intriguing to run UNION PACIFIC in a double bill with John Ford's 1924 epic THE IRON HORSE , which tells the same historical story , but with a different artistic tack & fictional characters .

The editor of the Cole County Clarion must decide what is the real IMPORTANT NEWS for his readers : an impending frost which may spell disaster to their crops , or the sensational shooting-down of a notorious gangster on their small town main street . This is an enjoyable little one-reeler , featuring a good performance by comic Charles ' Chic ' Sale . Today's viewers will perhaps be more interested in the appearance of uncredited James Stewart , as Sale's nephew / assistant . Slow talking & somewhat goofy , Stewart shows many of the attributes which would make him a huge star in a very short time . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera .

437265	306861	25641	10.0	Disney Visits Penguin Island	A Walt Disney SILLY SYMPHONY Cartoon Short . Peter & Polly , a couple of PECULIAR PENGUINS , share a romance of frigid delights on Antarctica's Penguin Island . Their happiness is soon threatened , however , by the arrival of a ferocious shark . . . A pleasant cartoon with cute characters , but no great significance . This was the type of animation which , by this time , the Disney artists could do in their sleep . The SILLY SYMPHONIES , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most fascinating of all animated series . Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount , with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music .

437746	306861	47187	10.0	How Rodents Won The West	A Walt Disney CHIP ' N ' DALE Cartoon . When Western bank robber Pete escapes with his loot , it is up to THE LONE CHIPMUNKS to capture and bring him to justice . This is a funny little film , with the tiny rodents almost meeting their match in the burly Pete - an enemy much more dangerous than their usual antagonists Donald Duck or Pluto ; casting them together was an inspired idea . Both the title and the film's conclusion are spoofs of the very popular media hero , The Lone Ranger . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle .

437564	306861	25657	10.0	A Dog's Life	A Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE Cartoon . The antics of PLAYFUL PLUTO causes trouble for Mickey in the yard , down in the cellar and around the house . This excellent black & white cartoon provides lots of sturdy laughs at the Pup's expense , who runs afoul of a whirlwind , a water hose , a flashlight , flypaper & a window shade . Walt Disney provides Mickey with his squeaky voice . It is excerpts from PLAYFUL PLUTO that Joel McCrea and the Hall Johnson Choir are watching during the emotional climax to Preston Sturges ' classic film , SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS ( 1941 ) . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle .

437630	306861	22251	10.0	Comedy On The Lam	In & out of prison , Stan & Ollie just can't seem to stay out of trouble . " PARDON US " was the Boys ' first starring feature film . Rather disjointed and poorly edited , it plays more like a few of their short subjects strung together . However , the Boys never falter and they deliver a film whose parts are greater than its whole . The film was meant to be a spoof of MGM's popular THE BIG HOUSE ( 1930 ) and it helps to have seen that earlier movie to fully appreciate this one . Many of the standard conventions of the typical prison film are mocked here : the ? understanding ' warden , the dangerous convict cell mate , the confinement in Solitary , the escape chased by bloodhounds , the prison riot . A few comedy pieces in particular stand out : Stan's loose tooth ; Ollie in the dentist's chair ; the Boys trying to settle into the constricted confines of an upper bunk . James Finlayson , Stan & Ollie's old nemesis , makes the most of his one scene as the prison schoolteacher driven to despair by the Boys ' good-natured idiocy . Walter Long is lots of fun as the Tiger , the meanest convict in the prison ( Boris Karloff played the part for the French language version ) . Movie mavens will spot an uncredited Charlie Hall as the dental assistant . An added delight is Babe Hardy's rendition of ? Lazy Moon , ' one of the decade's finest film songs . Ollie had a warm , evocative voice , full of feeling and emotion . Here , backed by the magnificent Hall Johnson Choir , his song reaches out of the screen and down the decades to touch the hearts of the audience .
437434	306861	26017	10.0	Another Triumph For W . C .	An eccentric family man is beset by seemingly insurmountable personal problems until he has a fortuitous encounter with a royal lady aboard a train . YOU'RE TELLING ME ! features the inimitable W . C . Fields in a hilarious fairy tale disguised as a domestic comedy . While there is neither magic or fantasy , there is a beautiful princess who arrives on the scene in good time to solve all of the poor hero's problems . Never mind the outlandishness of the plot , this unjustifiably obscure film gives Fields an excellent opportunity to show off some of his best routines . Whether shooting the tires on a police car , trying to control an obstreperous ostrich , or getting conked on the skull by his own wacky invention , he is never anything less than brilliant . During his initial conversation with the princess Fields portrays a surprisingly tender side to his nature completely at variance with his usual misogynistic self . These moments with a kinder , gentler W . C . are rare & very special . The romance between Joan Marsh & Buster Crabbe is mercifully brief and does not intrude too much on the story . Adrienne Ames makes a lovely princess and plays her scenes with Fields quite nicely . Fields ' films were often populated with she-dragons , formidable females against whom he could bounce off his humor . Here he has a small gaggle to contend with : Louise Carter as his domineering wife , Kathleen Howard as an insufferably snooty society doyen and Nora Cecil & Elise Cavanna as the town gossips . The film climaxes with Fields ' wonderful golf routine , in which he must deal with manmade hazards of all sorts . Tammany Young plays his infuriatingly inept caddie .
437221	306861	22197	10.0	East Is East And West Is West	A young San Francisco shipping magnate learns that NEVER THE TWAIN SHALL MEET when he falls in love with a passionate South Seas maiden . Celebrated MGM director W . S . Van Dyke took his love of foreign locales , mixed it with some stock footage of the Pacific Islands and created this obscure little pre-Code film which features fine performances embedded into a somewhat silly plot . There is more than a faint whiff of snobbish racism in the story which may interest modern viewers . British actor Leslie Howard gets an emotional workout as the man jarringly confronted with his lover's unfamiliar culture ; his slow dissipation is convincingly portrayed . Spanish teenager Conchita Montenegro gives an energetic & lively performance as the uninhibited child of nature who entices him to leave his wealth & position behind . Together they make a most interesting movie couple . Marvelous old Sir C . Aubrey Smith steals his scenes as Howard's concerned father . Lovely Karen Morley plays Howard's emotionally aloof girlfriend ; hearty Hale Hamilton is their arch reporter friend . Bearded Mitchell Lewis is most memorable in his one scene as a leprous sea captain ; Clyde Cook adds some color as an English derelict on Miss Montenegro's island . The phonograph which Miss Montenegro plays in her bamboo shack is a recording of ' Pagan Love Song ' ( by Nacio Herb Brown & Arthur Freed ) which became a big hit when sung by Ramon Novarro a couple of years earlier in another film directed by Van Dyke , MGM's THE PAGAN ( 1929 ) . Freed also composed the melody ' Islands of Love ' which is heard throughout NEVER THE TWAIN SHALL MEET .

438150	306861	22085	10.0	Not Many Laughs For Joe	A LOCAL BOY MAKES GOOD when a shy botany student joins the University of Ohio's track team to impress the beauty queen he idolizes . Comic Joe E . Brown does the best he can in this not-very-funny collegiate comedy , going over the same ground Harold Lloyd plowed to greater effect during silent days . It is not Brown's fault , the script is almost unrelenting in denying him any significant laughs . Not until the final sequence , when Brown must prove himself at the big track meet or forever live in ignominy , does he come into his element - with the help of a pretty girl's kiss and a strong shot of alcohol . Even the intensely annoying rear screen projection cannot destroy the fun of watching Joe ham it up . Dorothy Lee , temporarily escaped from Wheeler & Woolsey , plays the girl of Joe's dreams . As ever , she is kewpie-doll cute and it is great to see her , but her role as a psychology student desperate to engage with Joe's emerging libido is rather bizarre and a bit risqué . Easier to swallow is lovely Ruth Hall , the coed who admires Brown in silence . Edward Woods is Miss Lee's bullying boyfriend who can't wait to dig his spikes into Brown's flesh . Edward J . Nugent plays the team captain who befriends Joe after witnessing his remarkable sprinting ability . Movie mavens will recognize Maude Eburne as a sympathetic maid .
437404	306861	14429	10.0	Hanging Around With Harold Lloyd	The " human fly " antics which ends this movie is undoubtly the most famous sequence in all of silent cinema . It is also the most hilarious . Breathtaking , heart-stopping & very funny , it is the element that you remember the longest . While THE KID BROTHER was Harold Lloyd's masterpiece , SAFETY LAST was & is his most famous movie . But don't overlook the rest of the film in which he plays a lowly store clerk ( dealing with frantic female shoppers and an imperious floorwalker ) who tries to convince his rather gullible girlfriend - played by real-life wife Mildred Davis - that he's actually the store manager . Throughout , Harold Lloyd is beyond praise . His comic genius makes it all look so easy . And his athletic daredeviltry is even more amazing when you realize that 2 of the fingers on his right hand are fake - he lost the real digits in a freak studio accident .
438061	306861	20445	10.0	Disney's Salute To The Seasons , Opus One	A Walt Disney SILLY SYMPHONY Cartoon Short . It is SPRINGTIME at the marsh , and the joy of the season is causing the various birds & bugs to dance about rapturously and eat each other up . . . This black & white cartoon is basically an exercise in action / reaction animation . The Disney artists seem to have an unending supply of posterior gags , often rather vulgar . The tuneful soundtrack with its familiar themes pushes the action along - most notably Ponchielli's ' Dance of the Hours , ' which would be showcased to great effect eleven years later in the Studio's FANTASIA . The SILLY SYMPHONIES , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most interesting of series in the field of animation . Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount , with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music . There was little plot in the early Symphonies , which featured lively inanimate objects and anthropomorphic plants & animals , all moving frantically to the soundtrack . Gradually , however , the Symphonies became the school where Walt's animators learned to work with color and began to experiment with plot , characterization & photographic special effects . The pages of Fable & Fairy Tale , Myth & Mother Goose were all mined to provide story lines and even Hollywood's musicals & celebrities were effectively spoofed . It was from this rich soil that Disney's feature-length animation was to spring . In 1939 , with SNOW WHITE successfully behind him and PINOCCHIO & FANTASIA on the near horizon , Walt phased out the SILLY SYMPHONIES ; they had run their course & served their purpose .

Trouble is , mutts aren't allowed on the premises and what the Boys go through to keep theirs hidden shouldn't happen to a dog . . . A hilarious little film , one of the best , although ending with a suicide is a bit much . Highlight : Stan & Ollie on the roof . That's Charlie Hall as the ferocious landlord .

It's all pretty routine , until Gigantic , the huge & terrifying ape , escapes and spreads TERROR ON THE MIDWAY . With the enraged simian menacing Lois , it looks like a job for Superman . . . This was another in the series of excellent cartoons Max Fleischer produced for Paramount Studio . They feature great animation and taut , fast-moving plots . Meant to be shown in movie theaters , they are miles ahead of their Saturday Morning counterparts . Bud Collyer is the voice of Superman ; Joan Alexander does the honors for Lois Lane . And isn't that the voice of Jack ? Popeye ' Mercer as the first sideshow barker ?
437825	306861	45464	10.0	Happy Fingers	A small boy plots to upset the grand performance by THE 5 , 000 FINGERS OF DR . T . to be held in the sinister Terwilliker Institute . The whimsical world of Dr . Seuss first saw expression in a Hollywood feature film in this fast-paced fantasy which examines a child's musical nightmare . Although it was a financial & critical disappointment when initially released , it has established itself comfortably as a nostalgic favorite for Baby Boomers who first discovered it decades ago . Dr . Seuss ( Theodor Seuss Geisel , 1904-1991 ) wrote the original story , co-authored the script and penned the lyrics in his own inimitable style . The action plays itself out over vast , curvaceous sets which will immediately seem familiar to readers of his books , while the brightly colored costumes make the players look like characters from the good Doctor's stories come to life . Completely dominating the movie in the title role is the marvelous character actor Hans Conried ( 1917-1982 ) , gleefully breathing life into the part of the mad piano teacher who schemes to force 500 little lads into performing his compositions at a gigantic keyboard . Conried is wonderfully funny , striding about , leering , snorting & chortling as he plots his nefarious plans . He attacks the role with relish , nasally enunciating every syllable with his unique diction , softening his villainy with a thin veneer of unctuous civility . This was Conried's finest on-camera performance , but 1953 would also present him in the part for which he is perhaps best remembered , voicing Captain Hook in Disney's animated PETER PAN . The other three performers in the movie : Tommy Rettig as the much beleaguered boy attempting to thwart the evil Terwilliker ; Mary Healy as his lovely , albeit mesmerized , Mom ; and Peter Lind Hayes as a friendly , deadpanned plumber , all do very well with their roles , but their ordinariness , like that of Dorothy in Oz , make them pale in comparison beside Conried . The film , which delivers perhaps an unnecessarily nasty knock to piano teachers , does come across with some fine songs , ranging from Rettig's plaintive ' Because We're Kids ' to Conried's hilarious ' Dressing Song . ' Also on view is the bizarre Dungeon Dance , in which kidnapped male orchestra members present one of the most unusual terpsichorean displays ever seen in a kiddie film .

The title WASHEE IRONEE refers to the kid from the Chinese Laundry Spanky enlists to deal with Waldo's soiled ( and shrunken ) clothes . That's Tiny Sandford as the hapless traffic cop ; Billy Gilbert dubbed the Butler's sneeze .
437989	306861	22844	10.0	Hunting Up Trouble	A Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE Cartoon . Mickey finds THE DUCK HUNT he's taken Pluto on will become a most surprising experience . With a sparse plot and action driven almost completely by the soundtrack , this is an amusing black & white cartoon . Once again , the Disney animators indulge themselves with numerous underwear / posterior gags . Walt Disney supplies Mickey's voice . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle .

When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Bambi , Peter Pan and Mr . Toad . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
437693	306861	20902	10.0	Buster Keaton's Talkie Debut	A FREE AND EASY , hapless young man escorts Miss Gopher City , Kansas & her unspeakable mother out west to Hollywood , where they hope to make her a big time movie star . Fate , however , in the shape of a handsome movie actor , intervenes . . . With the end of the Silent Era , and Keaton no longer in control of his own career , FREE AND EASY was to be his first talking picture . While certainly not a classic , it has a certain small charm of its own and Keaton does a valiant job to provide both laughs & pathos . It is really not fair to compare Keaton's sound films with his silent masterpieces . They were two very different art forms . It is great fun to watch Buster stumble about the MGM lot , leaving chaos in his wake wherever he goes . Although there are awkward moments of staging , due largely to the restrictions of the microphone , Keaton's genius still shines through . He is given wonderful support from mammoth vaudeville veteran Trixie Friganza , as the ghastly stage mother . With her booming voice & facile face , she is able to steal scenes even from Keaton . They are hilarious together in their ' Oh King ! Oh Queen ! ' musical number . Lovely Anita Page , as Miss Gopher City , gets small chance to do anything here besides look lovely . But Robert Montgomery , as the movie actor , gets to show-off some of the charm that would very soon make him a major star . Verisimilitude is added to Keaton's chaotic adventures in Hollywood by peppering the scenes with real celebrities from the era appearing as themselves . Movie mavens should have fun spotting them : directors Cecil B . DeMille , Fred Niblo & Lionel Barrymore , as well as Jackie Coogan , Karl Dane , Dorothy Sebastian , John Miljan , Gwen Lee and 1930's top box office male , William Haines . That's Edward Brophy as the Stage Manager .
437227	306861	29682	10.0	Ghostly Encounters - - Act One	Cosmo TOPPER has his stuffy , henpecked life turned upside down by the interference of two recently deceased friends . The folks at Hal Roach Studios fashioned this popular supernatural comedy . Intended to be at the opposite extreme from the typical ghost thriller , there are no sudden chills or eerie ectoplasms here - - just lots of good humor and a few ( well done ) special effects . Owlish Roland Young plays the bemused recipient of his dead friends ' good deeds . No matter how drastically the intentions backfire , leading to arrest & scandal , Young remains a decent chap bent on regaining some equanimity in his life . ( What is most impressive about his performance are his hilarious physical contortions when under the invisible influence of the ghosts . ) Dear Billie Burke is wonderful , as usual , as Young's slightly bewildered wife , who has relinquished the role of lover to be mother hen to her husband - - hoping her control over him assures their acceptance by high society . As the Kerbys - - living and dead - - Constance Bennett & Cary Grant have plenty of star power & charm to spare and their spirits are certainly blithe , but a frank examination of their characters reveals some flaws . There is nothing funny about alcoholism or reckless driving , both of which contribute to their demise , and they are fortunate they kill only their own silly selves and not anyone else . That being said , they certainly do make a pair of great-looking spooks . The rest of the cast adds to the fun : Alan Mowbray once again plays a butler with an attitude ; young Arthur Lake appears as a hapless hotel employee ; elegant Hedda Hopper does well with her single scene as an unstuffy society doyenne ; J . Farrell MacDonald plays a no-nonsense cop ; and corpulent Eugene Pallette has fun with his role as a suspicious hotel detective . Composer Hoagy Carmichael appears as himself and Ward Bond plays a taxi driver , both uncredited . This was the first of a 3-film series and was followed by TOPPER TAKES A TRIP ( 1939 ) and TOPPER RETURNS ( 1941 ) .
438312	306861	194282	10.0	On The Green With Mr . Jones	A Warner Bros . Vitaphone Short SubjectBobby Jones , the world's greatest amateur golfer , gives valuable advice on how to improve one's putting skills . This was the first in a series of short films in which Warner Bros . lured this all-American athletic hero in front of the cameras to reveal his playing secrets in an entertaining manner . Celebrities from the Studio's roster would be trotted out to interact with Jones ; in this initial endeavor we see silent screen star Richard Barthelmess , comic actor Joe E . Brown , and character actor / playwright Frank Craven ( best remembered as the Stage Manager in OUR TOWN , 1940 ) . The poor sound quality is an annoyance in this early talkie , but not an insurmountable one . Robert Tyre Jones , Jr ( 1902-1971 ) began playing golf at the age of six and was entering competitions at the age of fourteen . He triumphed in many of these during his short amateur career and became the only person in history to win golf's Grand Slam ( British & American open and amateur tournaments ) in one year , 1930 . Shortly afterwards he retired at the age of twenty-nine . He never went pro and played only a few championships thereafter , but worked as a lawyer in Atlanta , Georgia . Jones helped organize the first Masters Tournament in 1934 in Augusta , Georgia . In 1958 , Bobby Jones was created an honorary burgess and guild brother in Scotland's St . Andrews , the traditional birthplace of golf . Sadly , ill health and paralysis caused this remarkable sportsman to spend his last years confined to a wheelchair . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios ' feature films .

The building of the contraption , especially Spanky helping Stymie put on the wheels , is hilarious . Highlight : the race down the very steep hill .

Two young trees , swept away by leafy bliss , carry on an arboreal romance which is threatened by the arrival of an evil-hearted old stump . . . This cartoon has a cute little story , but its significance lies in the fact that it was the first cartoon produced in Technicolor . Walt had cannily entered into an exclusive contract for the use of the procedure , only the latest of a string of risky innovations he would brave . Technicolor proved to be a sensation , and FLOWERS AND TREES pointed the way to the future . It would be three more years before Mickey Mouse took the Technicolor plunge - his films were so profitable he didn't need to abandon black & white just yet - but eventually virtually all cartoons would appear in one of a handful of competing color processes . The SILLY SYMPHONIES , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most fascinating of all animated series . Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount , with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music .

It's easy to prove that I'M NO FOOL AS A PEDESTRIAN if I pay close attention to Jiminy Cricket's admonitions . This is one of a short series of little television films in which Disney helped to inform viewers about basic safety concerns and the foolish ways in which lackadaisical folks can hurt themselves . The story of man's locomotion since caveman days is discussed - did you know Paris had the first sidewalks built for walkers in 1781 ? Jiminy Cricket , as voiced by the inimitable Cliff Edwards , is the perfect pedagogue . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle .

The Footlights Club is a theatrical boarding house where young women wait for the chance to make it big on Broadway . To deal with the disappointment & bitterness that can set in , they engage in wisecracks & gossip . Fiercely loyal to their friends , they can be wickedly spiteful to those that cross them . Always before them is their dream - to capture elusive success at the STAGE DOOR . A wonderful film , fresh & sparkling , with great dialogue infusing its wit & drama . The rapid-fire cross talk is still a real treat for viewers - as is the chance to see several fine young actresses early in their careers . The entire cast is excellent . Brash Katharine Hepburn is the new girl who quickly meets the ' regulars ' : feisty Ginger Rogers , cynical Lucille Ball , wisecracker Eve Arden , lively Ann Miller , snobbish Gail Patrick & sweet Andrea Leeds . While the young ladies certainly get most of the attention , be sure not to overlook Constance Collier , terrific as Miss Luther the has-been actress . Growing old on bittersweet memories , she is a constant reminder to the others what , even with success , they still might become . Adolphe Menjou gives his usual vivid performance as an immoral producer , while Samuel S . Hinds is good as Hepburn's father . Film mavens will enjoy spotting several familiar faces in uncredited roles : Jack Carson as a Seattle lumberman ; Grady Sutton as a butcher's helper ; Frank Reicher as a stage director ; Franklin Pangborn , hilarious as a butler ; and Ralph Forbes in the role of Hepburn's stage spouse .

Rupert was created by artist Mary Tourtel in 1920 and he has won generations of fans who eagerly follow his continuing adventures in the Daily Express newspaper . Since his inception , Rupert has personified the gentle joys & sweet innocence of childhood . It is precisely these qualities which this film so perfectly grasps . Sir Paul McCartney took on the project of creating RUPERT AND THE FROG SONG as a true labor of love . Not only did he co-author the storyline and executive co-produce ( sharing both duties with wife Linda ) , Sir Paul also wrote & composed the very cheerful song ' We All Stand Together , ' performed several of the speaking voices and arranged the music with Sir George Martin . The result for this small gem was a much deserved British Academy Award . Singing voices for the frog chorus were supplied by The St . Paul's Choir & The King Singers .
437937	306861	25161	10.0	Stanwyck Shines In Slick Soap	A high-minded GAMBLING LADY runs into trouble when she becomes connected with a society family . Breezy & entertaining , this was the sort of film which Warner Brothers created with such ease . Blessed with good acting & fine production values , these pictures were generally guaranteed to be crowd pleasers . As always , Barbara Stanwyck is utterly fascinating to watch . Not only talented & lovely , Stanwyck's great forte was her utter believability in any role she undertook . Here , she looks perfectly natural with a deck of cards in her hand , playing & dealing . Her authenticity is matched by the passion which she displayed with every performance . Her leading men are two of the best : rich boy Joel McCrea & genial crook Pat O'Brien - both do well by their roles . Given equal billing , the viewer is left guessing for quite a while which one will finish the film in Stanwyck's arms . Excellent support is given by marvelous old Sir C . Aubrey Smith as a kindly gentleman who befriends Stanwyck , Arthur Vinton as the head of a notorious Gambling Syndicate & eccentric little Ferdinand Gottschalk as Sir Aubrey's lawyer . Movie mavens will recognize Willie Fung as a member of the Syndicate , and Arthur Treacher & Louise Beavers as Sir Aubrey's butler & cook - all uncredited .
437737	306861	113692	10.0	A Cinema Pioneer Remembered	Neglected for a century , the aged woman's cinema treasures , like THE LOST GARDEN in a fairy tale , await rediscovery by a new generation . This poignant & thoughtful documentary introduces the viewer to Alice Guy-Blaché ( 1873-1968 ) , finally being acknowledged as the world's first - and for many years , only - female film director . Through the narration of her granddaughter , Adrienne Blaché-Channing , the viewer is introduced to a charming old lady with a remarkable past . Present at the very birth of the cinema in Europe , Guy-Blaché , through a series of fortunate circumstances , went on to direct hundreds of two-reelers in France & America from 1896 to 1920 . Long before talkies arrived in 1927 , she was pioneering the synchronization of motion pictures & sound . Today , tragically , she is virtually forgotten . Artistic flair is used in seemingly integrating interviewees directly into the ancient films . Using tantalizing selections from her surviving films - and a TV interview she granted before her death - the documentary gives a very good summary of Guy-Blaché's importance to the history of the moving picture .
437664	306861	27311	10.0	Come Dally In Arden's Forest	Dressed as a boy , a banished noblewoman meets her equally unfortunate suitor in a forest and teases with his affections . In AS YOU LIKE IT , a young , virile Sir Laurence Olivier leaps & cavorts his way through his first appearance in a Shakespearean feature film , his magnificent voice cajoling every line . To those viewers only aware of his late career before his 1989 death , an elderly lion enfeebled by terrible long-standing diseases , his athletic performance here will be a wonderful revelation . Although the plot requires him to behave blindly inane at times , fancifully wooing the boy who is actually his disguised ladylove , the future Lord Olivier is never anything less than compelling . Still nearly a decade away from the first of his own filmed Shakespearean productions - HENRY V ( 1945 ) - Sir Laurence here shows he is already a complete master of the Bard's verse . As Rosalind , and earning top billing , Austrian actress Elisabeth Bergner more than holds her own against Olivier . Her strong Teutonic accent is at variance with everyone else in the cast and she probably would not have received the role had she not been married to the director / producer , but this in no way should disparage her skills as an actress . Fetching & lovely and with a thorough grasp of her lines , Miss Bergner is a constant delight to watch . The comedy keeps her in male costume most of the time and it is important to remember that she is not really supposed to be a convincing boy . Bowing to the plot's absurdities , she is to provide some laughs and moments of reflection at the expense of the other characters and this Miss Bergner accomplishes most handily . A very fine collection of British character actors supply their ample talents to the proceedings . Sir Felix Aylmer is wonderfully wicked as the usurping Duke . John Laurie oozes evil as Olivier's murderous elder brother . Lovely Sophie Stewart provides playful fun as Miss Bergner's faithful cousin . Beefy Lionel Braham scores as a braggadocio wrestler . Mackenzie Ward is properly impertinent as Touchstone the Fool . Peter Bull is hilarious in his only scene as an idiotic youth . As in the play , the sardonic Jacques ( well played by Leon Quartermaine ) is given one of Shakespeare's loveliest soliloquies , the famous Seven Ages of Man speech . The entire film is given a sumptuous production which is most pleasing to the eye . A glance down its credits reveals something of its fine pedigree : Sir James M . Barrie , author of Peter Pan , suggested the treatment - which meant he helped in the adaptation of Shakespeare's play to the screen ; Sir David Lean , later to be a director of great importance , was responsible for the film's editing .
437013	306861	25101	10.0	Crooks & Feathers	A genial racketeer and his assorted companions hope to become very rich by stealing the FASHIONS OF 1934 . Here is another example of the Pre-Code comedy crime caper film which Warner Bros . seemed to produce so effortlessly in the early 1930's . Featuring good production values , witty dialogue , slick acting & utterly inconsequential in actual value , these movies were sure to be crowd pleasers and theater fillers . Affably sophisticated , William Powell is a fine crook , a rogue the movie audience can feel comfortable rooting for . He makes his life of larceny seem almost casual . Playing his artistic associate , Bette Davis not only scores in the acting department ( admittedly not very demanding ) , but she also looks fabulous , an instant refutation to anyone who ever thought she never looked glamorous on the screen . Through all the fluff & feathers she drops a few hints to the talent she would eventually unleash . The supporting cast is very commendable . Whimsical Hugh Herbert , as the California Ostrich King , gets to showcase his quirky humor . Frank McHugh scores as Powell's haplessly lecherous gofer . Lovely Verree Teasdale stirs up the plot as a Russian noblewoman who is not all she seems . Blustery Reginald Owen is a French couturier who runs afoul of Powell ; Henry O'Neill and chittering little Etienne Girardot are New York fashion designers who also are confronted by the gang's duplicitous dealings . Handsome Philip Reed is the talented musician who is Powell's romantic rival for Bette's affections . Movie mavens will spot Arthur Treacher as Miss Teasdale's butler , Jane Darwell as an enthusiastic Parisian customer & Hobart Cavanaugh , hilarious in the film's final moments as a desperate worm breeder ; all appear uncredited . One of the film's greatest assets is a musical production number created by the legendary Busby Berkeley . Meant to showcase ostrich feathers , ' Spin A Little Web Of Dreams ' is a dazzler with Busby's trademark identical blonde showgirls whirling through complicated circular movements & patterns . It is one of his most charming successes . Mention should be made of Orry-Kelly's fashions , which really are quite special .
437254	306861	84701	10.0	Come Walking In The Air With This Christmas Fantasy	THE SNOWMAN built by a lonely young boy comes to life at Midnight on Christmas Eve , propelling them both on a fanciful , unforgettable adventure . . . Raymond Briggs ' charming picture book comes to life in this delightful British cartoon . Here is a perfect excursion into realms of Imagination & Wonder . The Snowman's guided tour of the human child's home is a comic treat . Their flight over the frozen North Country & Polar Seas is exhilarating and full of white mystery . The serious themes of friendship's responsibility , and the inevitability of ultimate loss , are also hinted at . The ending is both beautiful & heartbreaking .
437673	306861	10040	10.0	Classic Mary Pickford Heart Warmer	An irrepressible orphan girl , living in the appalling conditions of a large asylum , is rescued by a mysterious benefactor and sent to college . Affectionately referring to him as DADDY-LONG-LEGS , she strives to make him proud of her . But when unexpected love comes her way , will she follow her heart or the wishes of her patron ? Mary Pickford was the greatest movie star of the 20th Century . No one else even came close to inspiring the love & devotion of the millions of fans who flocked to see her silent films . In our jaded age it is difficult to understand why a diminutive little lady could engender such ardor right around the world . For answers , one need look no further than DADDY-LONG-LEGS . Expertly blending joy & pathos , Mary makes us instantly feel the emotions her character is living through . Whether it's stealing a doll for a dying child , dunking a bully in a well , listening to her dead mother being insulted in the worst way , or feeling the pangs & delights of a first love , Pickford tugs at our heart strings , our tear ducts , our funny bones . To watch this film is to get a glimpse as to why America's Sweetheart stands absolutely unique in her legendary status . Although this is Mary's show all the way , in the supporting cast Milla Davenport should be noted for her vivid portrayal of the vile asylum warden . The film's director , Marshall A . Neilan , appears as a hapless young Lothario . It was the success of this film at the box office which inspired Pickford to form a studio & become her own distributor . So it was that United Artists was born , with partners Douglas Fairbanks , Charlie Chaplin & D . W . Griffith . The film has been beautifully restored , with a fine musical score . Notice the original ' art titles , ' the evocative paintings which enrich the captions .
437039	306861	33866	10.0	A Little Film Of Great Significance	Roused from somnambulistic lethargy to defend herself against unspeakable evil , a mighty nation would make foreign tyrants fear the sound of MAIN STREET ON THE MARCH ! Here is a tremendous example of the power of film when expertly crafted . It is also an invaluable video document of the situation in America at one of the supremely pivotal moments of her history . Blending documentary footage with Studio shots , the film quickly paints a snapshot portrait of the country and its moods in the months leading up to active participation in World War Two . Conceived by MGM as a stern warning against American neutrality in response to the threats of Axis aggression , the film was virtually ready for release when the Japanese Empire made its sneak attack against Hawaii on December 7 , 1941 . Producer John Nesbitt hastily rewrote & recorded the new narration , without altering the existing music or sound effects . The emotionally stirring result was considered so forceful that MAIN STREET ON THE MARCH ! was awarded the Academy Award for best two-reel short subject of 1941 . A sequel , MAIN STREET TODAY , was produced in 1944 . After Pearl Harbor , Hollywood went to war totally against the Axis . Not only did many of the stars join up or do home front service , but the output of the Studios was largely turned to the war effort . The newsreels , of course , brought the latest war news into the neighborhood theater every week . The features showcased battle stories or war related themes . Even the short subjects & cartoons were used as a quick means of spreading Allied propaganda , the boosting of morale or information dissemination . Together , Uncle Sam , the American People & Hollywood proved to be an unbeatable combination .
437510	306861	20667	10.0	At The Podium With Maestro Mouse	A Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE Cartoon . Mickey attempts to lead THE BARNYARD CONCERT of the ever popular ' Poet & Peasant Overture . ' The musical soundtrack drives nearly all the action in this virtually plotless little black & white film . Clarabelle Cow & Horace Horsecollar get to showoff their instrumental virtuosity : she plays the flute while he attacks a drum . Mickey rather cruelly extracts music from almost anything , including a litter of nursing piglets . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .

438266	306861	131409	10.0	Pixar Does It Again	Old GERI'S GAME of chess is played with great flair and passion , against a most worthy opponent and for a very special prize . Full of small surprises & great imagination , this is a wonderful little film from the folks at Pixar . Besides the basic entertainment factor - watching the old geezer play chess is a joy - the boundaries have been pushed again in computer animation's ability to depict the human body & the natural world . Fascinating on every level . Geri would return in a cameo in Disney / Pixar's TOY STORY 2 ( 1999 ) as The Cleaner , voiced by Jonathan Harris . Winner of the 1997 Oscar for Best Animated Short .
438257	306861	16123	10.0	Things Go Bump In The Night With Lon Chaney	A belittled clerk uses his ingenuity as an amateur detective to track down THE MONSTER responsible for some rather eerie recent disappearances . This is a wonderfully creepy silent film . With very good acting & excellent production values courtesy of MGM , it is too bad this movie is not better known . The large amounts of humor help to lighten the load considerably and are very welcome . The Master , Lon Chaney , adds another portrait to his gallery of grotesques . Slyly underplaying his character and letting his marvelous face act for him , Chaney more than makes up for the fact that his role is rather small . It is certainly ironic that this gentle man & terrific actor should be remembered principally for his bizarre & monstrous creations . Comic Johnny Arthur receives co-star billing with Chaney and he deserves it , since he carries the bulk of the action . He does a fine job with his character , giving him backbone & spunk rather than allowing any milquetoast tendencies to ever predominate . With the coming of sound , Arthur would perfect a nervous , whiny persona . He made his last screen appearance in 1951 , the year of his death at the age of 68 . Special kudos should be given to Walter James , Knute Erickson & George Austin for their strong support as a trio of very odd lunatics , all quite different & memorable . THE MONSTER is considered by many to be the first in a long line of Mad Doctor films . It is also a prime example of the Old Dark House genre of spook stories . It certainly has many of the elements : a crumbling edifice , a distressed young lady , escaped madmen , bony hands appearing from hidden panels , secret passageways and sudden death . The Old Dark House has for long years been a respected avenue in literature & movies to maximize suspense & tension . Indeed , it's only a short walk from the Edwards Sanitarium in this film to Wuthering Heights , Baskerville Hall , Manderley & the Bates House . . .
437764	306861	16104	10.0	They Had Faces Then	A romantic Prince from tiny Monteblanco attempts to woo THE MERRY WIDOW who once loved him when she was a poor dancer . Erich von Stroheim , the Teutonic genius who marched through Hollywood's Silent Days like a conquering general , had his final directorial stint at MGM Studios producing this lavish & brilliant film based on the operetta by Franz Lehár . The visuals are striking , with sets that look like actual locations - - a mountaintop village ; the Castellano Cathedral ; Maxim's in Paris - - and the occasional bizarre touch - - the blindfolded musicians sharing the Prince's seduction bed , for example - - which von Stroheim relished . The acting is flawless , with no need for dialogue . The actors ' faces speak all that need be said . Mae Murray & John Gilbert portray the passionate lovers whom Fate ( and the plot ) contrives to keep apart so successfully . Miss Murray ( she and the director loathed each other ) powerfully portrays a street-wise performer who , through a series of heartbreaks , becomes a vastly wealthy woman . Gilbert expertly plays a prince whose charm has always gotten him his way . Their scenes together , most particularly the waltz sequences , fairly blaze with unrequited sensual longing and desire . While it is entertaining to wonder what von Stroheim would have done with the role , it is difficult to imagine anyone better than Roy D'Arcy as the simpering , lusting , sneering Crown Prince ; he is pure villainy personified and his eventual fate is absolutely justified . Josephine Crowell gives a fine performance as the Queen . Tully Marshall , one of von Stroheim's favorite character actors , adds another portrait to his gallery of grotesques , this time playing a crippled baron with a foot fetish . The wonderful organ score which accompanies the film was arranged & performed by Dennis James . MGM would tackle THE MERRY WIDOW again nine years later and produce a vastly different film , this time directed by Ernst Lubitsch and starring Maurice Chevalier & Jeanette MacDonald .
437140	306861	38399	10.0	A Baseball Tall Tale	A Walt Disney Cartoon . The prospects were grim for the Mudville Nine that day , but all might change with CASEY AT THE BAT . . . The famous poem by Ernest Lawrence Thayer is given a lively spoof by the Disney folks in this little film which was originally a segment of MAKE MINE MUSIC ( 1946 ) . The animation is colorful and full of good humor and the boisterous musical recitation by radio comic Jerry Colonna is a tremendous asset . Our baseball hero would return in the cartoon short CASEY BATS AGAIN ( 1954 ) . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings .

There are a lot of laughs in this little film , especially as Donald frantically tries to retrieve the last of his pills . The Duck's splendid new voice is an obvious spoof of velvety-toned English actor Ronald Colman . The story was written by Roy Williams , later to be an important adult member of television's MICKEY MOUSE CLUB in the 1950's . Clarence Nash provides Donald with his ordinary voice .

438294	306861	25409	10.0	A Charming Keek At Auld Scotland	A mysterious & headstrong gypsy girl falls in love with THE LITTLE MINISTER called to pastor in a small Scots village . Soon her influence has him behaving in a most unclerical manner , with repercussions for the entire community . Although sadly neglected & overlooked , this fine , sentimental film , based on a 1891 novel by Sir James M . Barrie , features excellent performances and superior production values . RKO lavished care & money to get the details just right ; it is a fine example of how Hollywood films of the period could evocatively portray other times , other places . Katharine Hepburn has one of her most fetching roles in the exuberant Babbie . Full of boundless energy & good humor , yet fiercely protective of those weaker & less fortunate than she , Hepburn turns in a beguiling , always entertaining , performance . While there is really no mystery as to the true identity of her character , this in no way hinders Hepburn from continually delighting her expectant audience . In the title role , John Beal ( born James Alexander Bliedung in 1909 ) had doubtless the best role of his career in this , his second , film . By underplaying his scenes , he holds his own with the vivacious Hepburn . Exhibiting real star quality , it is unfortunate that the good movie roles failed to materialize . Beal did quite a bit of work through the years on the stage and had a triumph in television's THE ADAMS CHRONICLES in 1976 . John Beal died in 1997 at the age of 87 . A very fine supporting cast lends depth to the smaller roles : Andy Clyde as the lonely village policeman ; Donald Crisp as the local doctor ; Reginald Denny as a pompous army captain ; Mary Gordon as an elderly indigent ; Alan Hale as the community's repentant drunk ; Lumsden Hare as a strict & powerful church deacon ; Eily Malyon as a member of the aristocracy ; Beryl Mercer as Beal's devout mother ; and Dorothy Stickney as a fluttery maid . Mention should be made of Max Steiner's lovely score , which incorporates old & familiar tunes . A couple of historical notes : the Auld Licht ( Scottish for ' Old Light ' ) is mentioned many times in the film . This was the very conservative Church of Scotland , or Presbyterian Church in America , which had the allegiance of a majority of the Scots people . Barrie's original novel was of the Kailyard ( Scottish for a small cabbage patch near a cottage ) School of writing which had great favor in Scotland in the late 19th Century . This style featured highly idealized & sentimental representations of Scottish village life . Thrums in THE LITTLE MINISTER would certainly be a prime example .
437851	306861	48980	10.0	Wonderful Cinematic Gem	THE RED BALLOON rescued by a small Parisian lad will transform his life in unbelievable ways . This is a marvelous film , full of love & hope , searing sorrow & overwhelming joy . It is also a classic example of what can be done in a very limited time frame , with a compelling story and genius behind the camera . The special effects are still entrancing , with wonderful editing & camerawork which turns the byways & alleys of old Paris into the canvas on which this fantasy is painted . Director Albert Lamorisse's young son , Pascal , is the very fortunate star of this urban fairy tale . If the tribulations & persecutions of the Red Balloon appear to be a type of Epiphany , that is probably no coincidence .
437748	306861	47043	10.0	A Duck Tale With Mountain Lion	A Walt Disney DONALD DUCK Cartoon . The Little Ranger enjoys his job as guide at the Grand Canyon , until tourist Donald and a ferocious Mountain Lion give him a really bad day . . . This enjoyable little comedy doubtless got its name as it was one of Disney's first releases in Cinemascope . It also marked the final appearance in a Disney cartoon of the Mountain Lion , who retired to a cave in California's Hollywood Hills . Clarence " Ducky " Nash provided the voice for Donald ; Bill Thompson did the honors for Ranger J . Audubon Woodlore . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
