This enjoyable , albeit unremarkable , cartoon was the second to feature the Chipmunks - although they had yet to completely metamorphose into Chip ' n ' Dale . Their dialogue is almost completely unintelligible . Pluto gets most of the screen time - Mickey is left with just the bits & pieces . The last gag is strangely cruel . Nominated for an Academy Award . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Bambi , Peter Pan and Mr . Toad .

437945	306861	34886	7.0	Sonja Skates - Script Sinks	A pretty miss in ICELAND falls for an American Marine corporal stationed there temporarily during World War Two . Sonja Henie was Norway's ice queen when she won Olympic gold medals for skating in 1928 , 1932 & 1936 . After going professional , she began a celebrated movie career at 20th Century Fox in 1936 with her American film debut , ONE IN A MILLION . Beautiful & talented , as well as being a natural in front of the cameras , she carved out her own special niche during Hollywood's Golden Age . Although Miss Henie's ice routines may look antiquated by comparison to modern champions , there was nothing antique about her dazzling smile or sparkling personality . In this regard , some of today's snowflake princesses could still learn a great deal from her . As her career progressed , it became increasingly difficult for 20th Century Fox to find decent stories for Miss Henie and the excuses for the lavish ice dancing numbers were often implausible . No matter . Audiences did not flock to her films to watch Sonja recite Shakespeare . The movies were meant to be pure escapist fantasy , plain & simple . ICELAND is no exception and its story is often quite ludicrous . However , the skating episodes are pleasing and there is a generous amount of band music supplied by the Sammy Kaye Orchestra , which introduces ' There Will Never Be Another You , ' by Mack Gordon & Harry Warren . Thanks to the script , John Payne's romance with Sonja is kept a rather dull affair . As Payne's sidekick , Jack Oakie comes across as loud & annoying . Felix Bressart , a fine actor when given something decent to work with , plays Sonja's silly Papa . Fritz Feld makes the most of his few minutes as an inquisitive Icelandic functionary . Movie mavens will recognize an oddly uncredited Sterling Holloway , who is very funny as Sonja's erstwhile suitor . Ultimately , though , this is Sonja's show . She glides effortlessly into the viewer's heart , while balancing on a thin edge of silver , suspended over frozen water .
436997	306861	21533	7.0	Way Out West With William Haines	Although he's all but forgotten now , in 1930 , Hollywood's first full year of talkie films , William Haines was king of the box office . His movies - he starred in three of them - made more money than those of any other male star . WAY OUT WEST is one of those films . Haines plays a carnival shyster who cheats some cowboys out of their money with a crooked roulette wheel . They retaliate by kidnapping him , taking him back to their ranch and forcing him to work off the debt . There are some of the usual silly-billy antics you expect from a Bill Haines film . But there are also lapses into very serious areas as well . The look on Haines ' bleeding face after he's been roughed-up by a big cowboy , without a word spoken , speaks volumes . Also appearing are Leila Hyams , one of MGM's pretty starlets of the early 1930's ; Francis X . Bushman , Jr . ; the ubiquitous Polly Moran ; and little Cliff Edwards , who gets to play his ukulele & sing .

With the help of his dad , Alfalfa imagines what it would be like in college , when , as a football hero , he is ineligible to play in the big game because he neglected his TIME OUT FOR LESSONS . This little movie with a moral , made when the Rascals were a bit older , is thoroughly unfunny . Only the jitterbugging scene - with Darla belting out ' Swinging The Jinx Away ' - has any pep to it .

This little film has a few good moments , mostly dealing with the Rascals . Johnny Arthur , as Papa ( a champion whiner ) , actually turned 55 the year this was filmed . Wilma Cox is levelheaded Mama . Alfalfa warbles ' Many Happy Returns Of The Day ' .

But when he struggles to keep the love of a beautiful young American , he is reminded that he is still but a SON OF INDIA . This is a decent little film , with good production values and MGM lavished a lot of care in making it look exotic . As regards the plot , Ramon Novarro is practically the whole story . Here he adds another portrait to his long series of ethnic interpretations . Silent screen star Conrad Nagel appears as Novarro's American friend & a lovely Madge Evans plays his sister , Novarro's love interest . Marjorie Rambeau is given little do to as their unsympathetic aunt , while old Sir C . Aubrey Smith has a tiny role as a wise old English doctor .

At THE BIG PREMIERE , with the neighbor kids in attendance , cinematic chaos ensues . . . Few real laughs in this otherwise innocuous little film . Made after MGM got direct control of the Gang , and with the kids themselves noticeably growing up , it bears scant resemblance to the Rascals ' classics of yesteryear .
437669	306861	20647	7.0	Disney Journeys Across The Ice	A Walt Disney SILLY SYMPHONY Cartoon Short . The denizens of the North Pole are engaged in ARCTIC ANTICS . The penguins , seals , polar bear , and even a large walrus are marching about , jumping & dancing & slapping their bottoms an amazing number of times . . . This black & white cartoon has an invisible plot and is basically an exercise in action / reaction animation . The Disney animators seem to know a curiously large number of posterior gags . Notice that the face of the polar bear cub enjoys a remarkable resemblance to that of Mickey Mouse . The SILLY SYMPHONIES , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most interesting of series in the field of animation . Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount , with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music . There was little plot in the early Symphonies , which featured lively inanimate objects and anthropomorphic plants & animals , all moving frantically to the soundtrack . Gradually , however , the Symphonies became the school where Walt's animators learned to work with color and began to experiment with plot , characterization & photographic special effects . The pages of Fable & Fairy Tale , Myth & Mother Goose were all mined to provide story lines and even Hollywood's musicals & celebrities were effectively spoofed . It was from this rich soil that Disney's feature-length animation was to spring . In 1939 , with SNOW WHITE successfully behind him and PINOCCHIO & FANTASIA on the near horizon , Walt phased out the SILLY SYMPHONIES ; they had run their course & served their purpose .
437719	306861	28190	10.0	Taut , Tight Little Film Packs A Punch	Framed for crimes they did not commit , two young men are sentenced to five years at hard labor on a Southern prison's brutal ROAD GANG . Here is a fine example of the type of crime film which Warner Bros . produced so well . Although there are no big stars in the film , the acting is generally good , the stifling atmosphere is well maintained and the production values - especially in the prison camp / mine sequences - are of a high standard . Donald Woods makes a sturdy , stalwart hero ; made to endure various humiliations & punishments , he never wavers in his fight for justice . This is quite typical of the fine performances Woods gave during his career . Kay Linaker is enjoyable as his courageous fiancée . The film is sparked by a handful of noteworthy performances among the large cast : Carlyle Moore Jr . as Woods faithful , tragic buddy ; Henry O'Neill as a slick , utterly corrupt politician ; Edward Van Sloan as a shyster lawyer ; Olin Howlin as the lethargic prison doctor ; and Charles Middleton as the Blackfoot Mine's vile warden . ROAD GANG was a partial re-make of Warner's ' hit film from four years earlier , I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG ( 1932 ) , starring Paul Muni . In the days of the studio factory system , when churning out one picture after another in an almost endless supply was vitally important , it was not at all unusual to recycle the plots of successful A movies . The B pictures department would change elements here & there ( ROAD GANG has a much happier ending than the Muni film ) , and release an entirely new picture , hoping for another winner . This was the first film scripted by the young Dalton Trumbo , destined to be famous for more than just his celebrated screenwriting abilities .

437051	306861	26252	10.0	Little Shirley Invites You To Join Her For A Snack Of Animal Crackers	A spunky little orphan , who brings happiness into the rather bleak institution where she lives , shakes her CURLY TOP and wins the heart of a young bachelor millionaire . Her beautiful older sister doesn't do so badly , either . . . Shirley Temple is in her prime in this delightful family film . Her infectious smile & sparkling personality are ample indications as to why she was Hollywood's box office champ for years . Replete with talent & abundant charm , Little Miss Temple is a constant joy to watch & a source of never-failing amusement . Up against a champion scene stealer , the romantic leads in Shirley's films never got a great deal of attention and it is no different here . Although both are attractive and more than competent , John Boles & Rochelle Hudson are the latest duo to sacrifice themselves on Temple's altar . Each are even given pleasant songs to sing , but the viewer squirms impatiently , wishing the story to return to The Real Star . Shirley always found much stiffer competition from the wonderful character actors who populated her films . Here she's up against some heavy hitters . Sweet Jane Darwell & peppery Rafaela Ottiano appear as the matrons of the orphanage . Etienne Girardot plays a nasty-tempered trustee . Most especially there's the inimitable Arthur Treacher , adding another comic butler to his resume . This tall , imperious Englishman with the properly stiff upper lip was always a memorable cinematic companion to Miss Temple and he was more than capable of holding his own against the little moppet in the four films they shared . Movie mavens will recognize the great Billy Gilbert as Boles ' comic cook . Shirley gets to sing ' When I Grow Up ' & her classic ' Animal Crackers . '

He will also be showered with tenderness and affection from hearts good & true . He will grow to be a man made strong by adversity , but still wondering if he'll turn out to be the hero of his own life . He is DAVID COPPERFIELD . Charles Dickens ' masterpiece comes to marvelous life in this triumphant translation from literary classic into film . Enormous care was taken by MGM to get the look & feel just right - to make the viewer believe they were seeing the novel spread out before them , without a false moment from start to finish . ( The Studio even went so far as to use special on-location exterior filming at Canterbury Cathedral , a segment that only runs for a few seconds . ) The all-star cast is remarkable : Freddie Bartholomew , newly brought from England by his aunt , is perfect in the role of Young David ; his anguish at the death of his mother is almost palpable . Replacing a reluctant Charles Laughton , W . C . Fields proved a triumph in the comic role of the penniless Mr . Micawber , always confident of something ' turning up . ' ( You might think Fields ' American accent & mannerisms would tend to be grating , but he turns in what is arguably his finest performance . Fields had loved Dickens ' novels for years and always kept a few in his vaudeville trunk . He knew the role and how to play it . Here he takes the character of Micawber , tweaks it slightly , and delights us . ) Lionel Barrymore , as the old fisherman Dan'l Peggoty , adding yet another exceptional portrait to his gallery of character parts . Edna May Oliver is unforgettable as the stern , yet loving , Aunt Betsey , forever chasing donkeys off her property - fiercely defensive of those she cares for . Basil Rathbone as Mr . Murdstone , dark & dangerous , full of passions & fury . Maureen O'Sullivan as darling Dora , sweet & doomed . Roland Young as an oily Uriah Heep , sniveling & devious . Lewis Stone , Elizabeth Allan , Una O'Connor , Lennox Pawle , Elsa Lanchester , Violet Kemble Cooper , Madge Evans , Frank Lawton - all perfectly cast . ( Look for E . E . Clive , Lionel Belmore & Arthur Treacher in tiny uncredited roles . Sir Hugh Walpole , the celebrated English novelist who adapted the novel for the screen , appears as the Vicar . ) Savor this wonderful film again & again .
438020	306861	13075	10.0	Much Medical Merriment With Mr . Lloyd	Young DR . JACK tries to save a pretty invalid from the machinations of an unscrupulous medical quack . Silent comedian Harold Lloyd had another success in this wildly funny movie . Healthy servings of sentimental nostalgia mixed into the plot only add to the fun . Playing a doctor whose good humor & common sense make him the most popular fellow in rural Magnolia Meadows , Harold makes full use of his tremendous athletic abilities to propel the storyline , piling one gag on top of another . Whether exiting his moving jalopy to shoo cows from his path , saving a naughty tyke from a spanking or breaking up a poker game in a most unique fashion , Harold is never less than hilarious . Finally , he leads one of his wild trademark chases , this time through a spooky house , a sequence that includes both a wonderful Lon Chaney spoof and one of the funniest enraged dogs to ever appear on film . Mildred Davis has an unusually good role , showing off her acting skills as the spunky invalid . Eric Mayne is appropriately hissable as the bearded villain . Movie mavens will recognize OUR GANG's mischievous Mickey Daniels as Harold's freckle-faced patient and darling old Anna Townsend as the lonely mother of Harold's lawyer friend - both uncredited . Robert Israel has composed an excellent film score which perfectly complements Harold's antics on the screen .

The biggest liar in the Marine Corps claims to be a musical genius , but his buddies get mighty sore when a piano is delivered to their South Seas island base and the fellow says ' I WON'T PLAY . ' Propelled by the wise guy personality of Dane Clark and the loveliness of Janice Paige ( who gets to sing ' Body and Soul ' ) , here is an enjoyable , lighthearted little film which still should entertain viewers today . This is the type of fast-moving escapist fare that was so valued by weary movie audiences as World War Two dragged into its sixth year . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something like writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . This particular film was the winner of the Academy Award for the Best 2-Reel Live Action Short for 1944 .

438174	306861	38975	10.0	A Well-Crafted Thriller	It is a dark & stormy night . The old mansion stands alone in the driving rain . Inside wait eight people , driven apart by their animosities & fears . For they have much to be frightened about . Somewhere out in the storm there lurks a maniacal killer of young handicapped women - a murderer who has slain before & is ready to strike again . The pretty mute maid knows this . But does she know what is watching - and waiting - in the shadows of THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE ? This is a very fine chiller , most effective in the mood of mounting terror which it builds . A Gothic thriller of this sort is rather rare in the second half of the 1940's when , after the War , a new realism had settled on Hollywood . The performers do very nicely with their roles : Dorothy McGuire , young & vulnerable as the girl who hasn't spoken since witnessing her parents ' horrific deaths ; Kent Smith as the gallant doctor who wants to protect her ; George Brent & Gordon Oliver as the two half-brothers of the household , mistrustful & envious of each other's position ; wonderful old Ethel Barrymore , the dying matriarch , acid-tongued & suspicious of nearly everyone ; Sara Allgood as her nurse , resentful of her mistreatment ; Rhonda Fleming , the beautiful secretary , who may arouse passions once too often ; Elsa Lanchester & Rhys Williams as the domestics , she an alcoholic and he bitter and withdrawn . ( Film mavens will spot Ellen Corby as the woman at the boarding house murder scene . ) Special mention should be made of the mansion itself . In many ways it becomes a character in its own right . From top floor to cellar , we get to know its rooms & spaces well - with that twisting staircase tying all the nooks & crannies together .

437087	306861	21861	10.0	Antique Western Worth Remembering	During the Civil War , FIGHTING CARAVANS of freight wagons make their way West , crossing hostile Indian country . This sturdy Zane Grey Western , largely forgotten over the decades , offers some fine entertainment with its good performances and vivid location filming . The number of wagons , livestock and extras used show that Paramount Studios paid out a fair few pennies for decent production values . The dramatic struggles across the wilderness and a rousing Indian attack help punch up the action considerably . Laconic Gary Cooper stars as the trail guide helping to lead the teamsters and settlers through dangerous territory . Hot-tempered Lili Damita plays a solitary French maiden driving her wagon West . Their intermittent romance is completely predictable , but the two young performers make it all very watchable . Stealing their every scene are a pair of old pros from the Silent days : Ernest Torrence & Tully Marshall . Playing a couple of grizzled , drunken , women-hating trail guides - - as well as Coop's best buddies - - they are very amusing in their attempts to break-up the budding romance between their protégé and the troubling Miss Damita . Rotund Eugene Palette is on hand as a lovelorn member of the wagon train . Charles Winninger enlivens the film's opening minutes as the blustery Marshal of Independence , Missouri . Movie mavens will recognize sweet Jane Darwell as a pioneer and Iron Eyes Cody as a Fort Indian in search of firewater , both uncredited .

Each of the eight humans , and all of the animals , have specific chores to do . The immense task is no sooner finished than the storm clouds start rolling in . . . A lively retelling of the Biblical story . The large menagerie of animals are fun to look at and must have kept the animators very busy . Most Sunday School lessons would not include the rabbit & dog gags with which Disney ends the cartoon . The SILLY SYMPHONIES , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most fascinating of all animated series . Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount , with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music . There was little plot in the early Symphonies , which featured lively inanimate objects and anthropomorphic plants & animals , all moving frantically to the soundtrack . Gradually , however , the Symphonies became the school where Walt's animators learned to work with color and began to experiment with plot , characterization & photographic special effects . The pages of Fable & Fairy Tale , Myth & Mother Goose were all mined to provide story lines and even Hollywood's musicals & celebrities were effectively spoofed . It was from this rich soil that Disney's feature-length animation was to spring . In 1939 , with SNOW WHITE successfully behind him and PINOCCHIO & FANTASIA on the near horizon , Walt phased out the SILLY SYMPHONIES ; they had run their course & served their purpose .

He latches onto fickle Prunella Pullet , who acquiesces completely to his charms - much to the chagrin of her skinny boyfriend , Hick Rooster . . . This is a very colorful & entertaining cartoon . Its highlight is a wild spoof of Hollywood dance musicals , from Rogers / Astaire ( complete with " The Carioca " ) to a terpsichorean extravaganza even Busby Berkeley would be proud of .

437556	306861	23982	10.0	All Runners Batted In	ELMER , THE GREAT home run hitter doesn't want to leave his pretty boss in Gentryville , Indiana , to play ball for the Chicago Cubs . Rubber-limbed comic Joe E . Brown scores big in this fine little comedy . Without even trying , the fellow could be funny - his huge grin and mischievous eyes a sure catalyst for laughter . In his first scenes , the mere act of his putting on his socks or eating his breakfast is a riot . The film also gives him a chance to suffer from unrequited love and face the abuse heaped on him for his yokel ways as he tries to deal with professional ballplayers and dangerous gamblers . Brown carries it all off with natural aplomb . A sturdy cast lends fine support : pretty Patricia Ellis as Brown's conflicted boss ; sweet Emma Dunn as his loving mother ; goofy Sterling Holloway , perfectly cast , as Brown's baseball-mad younger brother ( notice that Holloway's name is spelled incorrectly in the credits ) . Blustery Berton Churchill plays the owner of the Cubs , Preston Foster is the manager . Genial Frank McHugh plays the Cubs catcher . Claire Dodd has a mysterious role ; she seems to be a chum of the ballplayers and little else - but at least she's easy on the eyes and the plot doesn't try to set up a silly romance between her and Brown . Casino hoodlum J . Carrol Naish plays the film's villain . Movie mavens will recognize an uncredited Jessie Ralph as Brown's plain speaking , softhearted housekeeper . The early scenes in Gentryville have a delightfully homespun , nostalgic charm which the later Chicago sequences can't match . Notice the fine use the minimal soundtrack makes of just two songs : ? Take Me Out To The Ball Game ' & ? On The Banks Of The Wabash . ' Brown's use of a four-letter word near the film's climax underscores the film's pre-Code status . Also of interest , in the last inning of the final World Series game , the plot has the catcher & pitcher of the New York Yankees deliberately and maliciously cheat in an attempt to win . One wonders what Babe Ruth & Lou Gehrig must have thought of that . . . ELMER , THE GREAT was the second of Brown's ? baseball trilogy , ' the other films being FIREMAN , SAVE MY CHILD ( 1932 ) & ALIBI IKE ( 1935 ) .
437841	306861	33243	10.0	To Heal The Sick	With almost Biblical intensity , a courageous doctor searches for the cure for a disease which ravaged the South in the years before 1920 . This short film memorably profiles Dr . Joseph Goldberger ( 1874-1929 ) and his conquest of the scourge pellagra . Shepperd Strudwick plays the good doctor . The extracts from newsreel footage woven into the narrative give the story historical authenticity . ( To be technically specific , the missing protein substance which caused the dietary deficiency was niacin , and was identified after Goldberger's death . ) Directed by Fred Zinnemann , this was part of the MGM series John Nesbitt's Passing Parade , and was narrated by Mr . Nesbitt . Movie mavens will recognize an unbilled Bill Wolfe , W . C . Fields ' buddy , appearing for a few moments as a hungry , destitute man . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios ' feature films .
437056	306861	23949	10.0	Wheeler & Woolsey Journey Into A State Of Confusion	A pacifistic Indian tribe sends two zany barbers to be its envoys at the Peace Conference in Geneva . The DIPLOMANIACS soon find themselves up against the machinations of spies working for a powerful munitions company who have a vested interest in seeing that war continues the demand for their explosive bullets . Wheeler & Woolsey take a plot ridiculous even by their standards and manage to get some solid laughs out of it . The Boys ( Bert Wheeler is the little fellow with the curly hair ; Robert Woolsey is the skinny guy with the cigar & glasses ) are always tremendous fun to watch , but the viewer who tries to find anything meaningful or coherent in this film would be wasting their time . However , in its own goofy way , DIPLOMANIACS holds its own against DUCK SOUP & MILLION DOLLAR LEGS , two contemporary films with which it shares an hysterical point of view . The Boys are given a fine supporting cast , each of whom get to shine for a few moments , as they are given no chance for any real character development : Louis Calhern as the suave master spy ; Edgar Kennedy as the harried head of the Peace Conference ; elderly Richard Carle as an inebriated ship's captain ; spunky little Marjorie White as Wheeler's violent love interest , choking him into submission ( a very funny comedienne nearly forgotten today , a tragic car wreck would claim her life two years after the release of this film ) ; and Hugh Herbert as an inscrutable proverb-spouting Oriental . Movie mavens will spot Charlie Hall as an eager beaver valet . Wheeler & White fight their way through ' Sing To Me ' - while the Boys vocalize with ' On The Boulevard ' and ' No More War . '
437883	306861	134155	10.0	War's Cost , Love's Hope	An MGM PASSING PARADE Short Subject . Peter Ravitch , a gentle soul from a small Yugoslav town , writes a poignant letter TO MY UNBORN SON as he lies dying from a Nazi bullet . This true-life story of courage against the Nazi oppressor features a reading of Peter's remarkable letter , in which he hopes for a peaceful world full of boundless opportunity & joy for his son . The film is a good example of MGM's mastery of the short subject format . After Pearl Harbor , Hollywood went to war totally against the Axis . Not only did many of the stars join up or do home front service , but the output of the Studios was largely turned to the war effort . The newsreels , of course , brought the latest war news into the neighborhood theater every week . The features showcased battle stories or war related themes . Even the short subjects & cartoons were used as a quick means of spreading Allied propaganda , the boosting of morale or information dissemination . Together , Uncle Sam , the American People & Hollywood proved to be an unbeatable combination . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel .

437097	306861	35196	10.0	A Pup Tale With Beasties	A Walt Disney PLUTO Cartoon . You can be sure there will be plenty of action with PLUTO AT THE ZOO attempting to steal a huge bone from the lion . This standard Disney film is enlivened by Pluto's encounters with the lion , kangaroo , ape & crocodile . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality .

437337	306861	28367	10.0	Superior Western	A trio of desperadoes , fleeing from a violent Christmastime bank robbery , become THREE GODFATHERS after rescuing a dead mother's baby in the desert . Here is a very fine little film , ( largely forgotten due to its color remake years later starring John Wayne ) which rewards the fortunate viewer with very good acting , excellent production values , some taut drama and a fair amount of humor . Lewis Stone dominates the film as the thief with a conscience . Quietly intellectual & patrician , his tenderness for the infant is immediate and absolute . Stone's acting cannot be faulted ; watching him painfully choose which of his beloved books to leave behind in the burning desert is to see a true artist at work . Chester Morris does a dandy job of making the viewer both like and despise his character . Quick-tempered & revengeful , his attack upon the New Jerusalem bank is his opportunity to wreck havoc on both the town which rejected him and the decent young banker in love with his former sweetheart . Morris wants nothing to slow down his escape - - not poisoned water holes or dead horses , and especially not a helpless baby . Walter Brennan practically steals the entire movie with his portrayal of an old , illiterate outlaw whose childlike innocence and decency compels him to protect the infant . He also has some droll comedy sequences , especially at the Church Social , where he has a memorable encounter with a plate of asparagus . His scenes in the desert , with desperate thirst stalking his footsteps , show the consummate skill he would exhibit the rest of his life as one of America's favorite character actors . In smaller roles , Sidney Toler is wonderfully droll as an itinerate dentist with a deadly aim ; bucktoothed Victor Potel is his unfortunate customer . Rotund Roger Imhof plays the friendly sheriff of New Jerusalem ; Dorothy Tree is the saloon hostess with a hankering for Morris . Pretty Irene Hervey does well as Morris ' former love ; her fiancé is nicely played by Robert Livingston , who finds the padding in his Santa suit to be most fortuitous .
437977	306861	32842	10.0	Excellent Early World War II Thriller	An intrepid British spy boards the NIGHT TRAIN TO MUNICH in a desperate attempt to rescue a scientist & his beautiful daughter from the Nazis . Here is an excellent wartime thriller , with just the right amount of puckish humor to keep the film from becoming too heavy . Very fine acting & excellent production values add tremendously to the success of the film , with director Sir Carol Reed showing hints of the style which would distinguish his postwar crime classic , THE THIRD MAN , a decade hence . Margaret Lockwood is lovely , but she is given remarkably little to do outside of looking anxious or scared . Not to worry , the action is carried admirably by the male side of the cast , most notably Sir Rex Harrison as the British agent . Whether glibly singing silly songs or engaged in deadly gun battles in the Bavarian Alps , he carries off his role with his characteristic aplomb . Paul Henreid completes the quasi-romantic triangle . Menacing & sophisticated , he is an excellent example of Nazi determination & evil . Sir Felix Aylmer , very effectively playing against type , wraps his unique voice around the small part of a German spy master . Roland Culver , Torin Thatcher & Ian Fleming - the character actor , not the author - might be glimpsed in cameo roles . Fans of Sir Alfred Hitchcock's splendid THE LADY VANISHES ( 1938 ) will be heartened at seeing the return of the characters Charters & Caldicott , those criquet-mad twits , played by the original actors , Basil Radford & Naughton Wayne . Their initial performances had proved so successful that they were given the opportunity to reprise the roles several times , this being the most successful of their reappearances . Their inclusion here , about two-thirds into the story , gives the film a decided lift , making the whole procedure jolly good entertainment .

It is a beautiful day , and the BIRDS OF A FEATHER of the forest & farmyard are romancing their mates and tending to their young . That is , until a rapacious raptor comes on the scene & carries off a baby chick . . . This black & white cartoon is another example of how important music ( often classical ) was to the Symphonies . The SILLY SYMPHONIES , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most interesting of series in the field of animation . Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount , with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music .

437763	306861	32871	10.0	Caveman Canon	Prehistoric man strives to elevate himself above the bestial in ONE MILLION B . C . Hal Roach Studios produced this vivid and exciting film which ambitiously takes on nothing less than presenting the Birth of Civilization and the Beginning of Civility . That it does so without seeming pedantic or foolish is due in large measure to fine performances and special effects which still look good many decades later . The viewer knows the exploding volcano is a fraud and the dinosaurs are actually magnified lizards , but somehow it does not matter . The entertainment value is real and the sentiments presented by the actors still ring true . Victor Mature & Carole Landis do quite well in roles which demanded speaking little more than nonsense words and grunts and using a significant amount of pantomime . They have no difficulty in conveying their thoughts and emotions to the audience . Their characters ' efforts just to survive in an exceedingly harsh environment elicit the viewer's interest and respect . Lon Chaney Jr , in a role his father would have relished , plays the brutal chief of the Rock People . Silent film actor Nigel De Brulier portrays the Shell People's gentle patriarch . Another star from silent days , Conrad Nagel , appears in the movie's opening sequence as the slightly obsessed scientist who interprets the cave paintings which tell the film's tale .

The BEAU HUNKS are soon sent to relieve an isolated fort , but arrive just in time to endure a fierce Arab attack . . . A bit longer & more elaborate than most of the Boys ' short subjects . Stan & Ollie were excellent at this kind of farce ; they provide lots of laughs as they try to act like competent Legionaries . As an added treat , Ollie gets to sing ' I Love You ' in that wonderfully nostalgic high tenor voice of his .
437248	306861	15016	10.0	John Ford's First Epic Look At American West	A young boy grows to fulfill his murdered father's vision of seeing THE IRON HORSE , the mighty transcontinental railway , stitch the country together , binding East to West . Bursting with excitement & patriotic fervor , THE IRON HORSE is the film which put young director John Ford on the cinematic map . He brought together all he had learned from years of making shorter , smaller films and he produced a product which heralded his enormous contributions to sound films in the years to come . This is a ' director's picture ' in that the stars , as good as they are , are almost negligible ; what was important here was Ford's vision & his ability to place it before the audience . Indeed , he does not even bring his leading man ( George O'Brien ) on screen until 45 minutes into the story - a shortcut to disaster almost anywhere else . ( In all fairness it should be noted that O'Brien , handsome & strong-limbed , does very well as the gentle hero . He would find similar roles in other epic films of the decade . J . Farrell MacDonald , as Irish Corporal Casey , is the prototype for many comically eccentric fellows who would appear in other Ford westerns . ) The film often takes on the aspects of an ancient newsreel . Cattle drives , Indian attacks & endless track laying all look utterly real . Particularly fascinating is the depiction of the dismantlement of the end-of-the-track town , so that not even a dog is left , as it is moved many miles further on to the west . This type of arcane information is what makes watching very old films so enjoyable . THE IRON HORSE represented the largest migration out of Hollywood for location shooting up to that time . Nothing like this had been attempted before , so Ford & his lieutenants were forced to make up the rules as they went along . Hiring a circus train , the small army of extras arrived at the subzero Nevada location in January of 1924 . The conditions which greeted them were authentically primitive . It was so cold , the extras quickly began sleeping in their costumes . Finding the train to be flea ridden , they moved into the sets and began living exactly as the characters they were portraying . The female extras especially suffered from the rugged conditions . A frontier mindset seemed to take over many of the cast & crew ; the circus tent , which doubled as both the movie saloon and the crew's commissary , eventually had to have the catsup bottles removed from the tables to discourage the many fights which kept breaking out . Authenticity found its way into the movie in other , more positive , ways . Several of the elderly Chinese extras , representing laborers on the Central Pacific , had actually worked on the real McCoy sixty years previous . They came out of retirement to appear in the film & enjoyed themselves immensely . Ford also managed to locate the two original locomotives which met at Promontory Point , Utah , in 1869 and reunited them for the film's climax . Composer John Lanchbery has contributed a splendid soundtrack to the restored video version , incorporating several contemporaneous tunes of the period . It would be intriguing to double bill THE IRON HORSE with Cecil B . DeMille's UNION PACIFIC ( 1939 ) , which tells the same historical story , but with a completely different tack & set of fictional characters .

This is a very enjoyable little film , with first-rate animation . The opening sequence , with Donald canoeing along the river , dodging waterfalls & making music with his guitar , is especially fine . Clarence " Ducky " Nash shows what an integral component he was in Donald's cinematic success - his vocalizations here are excellent . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings .

437974	306861	30265	10.0	Literate & Intelligent Entertainment	A cunning king of France allows a rapscallion poet to become Lord High Chancellor - for the space of only one week . . . IF I WERE KING is a fascinating film based on the fictionalized lives of two very real personages , Louis XI and François Villon . The performances are impeccable , Preston Sturges ' script is literate and Paramount Studios provided excellent production values . As Villon , Ronald Colman makes full use of his most magnificent talent - his beautiful speaking voice . Like honey flowing over velvet , it caresses the dialogue & adds emotional heft to the lines of Villon's poetry used in the film . While perhaps a bit mature to swashbuckle altogether convincingly , he plays the lover very creditably in the romantic scenes . Obviously determined not to acquiesce the entire film to Colman , Basil Rathbone is hilarious as King Louis . Gaunt , wizened & cackling like a crone , he effortlessly steals his every scene . Eschewing the use of his own superb speaking voice , Rathbone plays a character that will remind some viewers of the disguises the actor would use shortly as Sherlock Holmes . The sequences between Rathbone & Colman are very enjoyable , especially since in their only other joint appearance , A TALE OF TWO CITIES ( 1935 ) , they had no scenes together . The two women involved in Villon's life are portrayed by Frances Dee & Ellen Drew , one an aristocrat , the other a wench - lovely ladies both . Smaller roles are filled by fine character actors Henry Wilcoxon , Walter Kingsford , Sidney Toler , John Miljan & Montague Love . Way down the cast list is the always reliable Ralph Forbes , playing the king's toady . Movie mavens will spot an uncredited Lionel Belmore playing the Chief Steward of the royal palace . Fat & ugly , Louis XI ( 1423-1483 ) was nicknamed ' the Spider ' as a grudging tribute to his remarkable skills at plotting & scheming . Although he showed talent in administration from an early age , he also was quite adept at angering his father , Charles VII , and ultimately had to take refuge at the Burgundian court until the time of his succession to the throne . Almost universally unpopular , he set up an elaborate spy network which kept him informed as to nearly all that went on in his kingdom . His overriding mission was to crush the power of the great nobles , especially Burgundy - now ruled by the successor to Louis ' former protector - and this he was largely able to do , thanks to his policy of encouraging the minor nobles and the middle class . The might of the French crown was significantly strengthened during his despotic reign . François Villon ( 1431-1463 ? ) was both France's greatest lyric poet and a complete scoundrel & ruffian . Raised by a chaplain , Villon absorbed none of the virtues of the Church , consorting with the basest of companions and involving himself in numerous scrapes , misdeeds & robberies . His murder of a priest during a street brawl was but one of several outrages . Imprisoned many times both in Paris and other French municipalities , Villon was almost preternaturally fortunate in being able to take advantage of various pardons & amnesties - all undeserved . After one final clemency , he was banished from Paris for life - whereupon he completely disappears from the historical record . Although stained by a most unsavory reputation , critics have long admired Villon's poetry and have extolled both the exquisite imagery of his tender verses and the unremitting detail in the poems describing his coarser experiences . The bulk of the tale told in IF I WERE KING is a complete fantasy . There is no indication that Louis XI & Villon ever even met .

The SILLY SYMPHONIES , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most interesting of series in the field of animation . Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount , with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music . There was little plot in the early Symphonies , which featured lively inanimate objects and anthropomorphic plants & animals , all moving frantically to the soundtrack . Gradually , however , the Symphonies became the school where Walt's animators learned to work with color and began to experiment with plot , characterization & photographic special effects . The pages of Fable & Fairy Tale , Myth & Mother Goose were all mined to provide story lines and even Hollywood's musicals & celebrities were effectively spoofed . It was from this rich soil that Disney's feature-length animation was to spring . In 1939 , with SNOW WHITE successfully behind him and PINOCCHIO & FANTASIA on the near horizon , Walt phased out the SILLY SYMPHONIES ; they had run their course & served their purpose .
437530	306861	32049	10.0	Vivid Acting Brings Royal Drama To Life	From the confines of the gloomy TOWER OF London , Richard , the treacherous Duke of Gloucester , murders his way to the throne of England . This lively & enjoyable pseudo-historical drama presents some surprisingly good performances which do much to elevate the film and make it quite enjoyable . Basil Rathbone is excellent as Richard , leering & smirking , dangerous as a poisonous serpent , he takes what could be a rather hammy part and gives it a certain malevolent stature . Here was a villain able to charm , coddle or kill his own brothers with equal skill . Rathbone makes him quite believable . ( Oddly , while carrying Richard's humpback , Rathbone ignores the King's withered left arm . ) Although this is not a horror film , Boris Karloff's Mord the Executioner is a very horrific character . Bald headed & club-footed , he stalks about the Tower carrying out Richard's foul orders . Karloff makes an indelible mark in his very first scene , inflicting more torments on the denizens of the torture chamber . With such a striking performance , as well as his status as one of Universal's most celebrated actors , it is strange that Karloff doesn't receive equal billing with Rathbone here . Vincent Price does very well in the role of the nervous , jealous , doomed Duke of Clarence , holding up nicely to the over-the-top performances of Rathbone & Karloff . ( It is fascinating to see this early teaming of the three frightmeisters ; the next time they would all appear in the same film would be in 1963's THE COMEDY OF TERRORS . ) Special mention should be made of Ian Hunter as Edward IV . While acquiescing to all of Rathbone's bloody schemes , Hunter nonetheless injects an element of sardonic humor into the role , making it very entertaining . Barbara O'Neil as stately Queen Elizabeth , Nan Grey as spunky Lady Alice & Rose Hobart as lovely Anne Neville each do good work in roles which demand little from any of the actresses . The supporting cast is sprinkled with familiar faces - Leo G . Carroll , Miles Mander , Lionel Belmore , Ernest Cossart - each excellent in small roles . Far down the cast list is Ralph Forbes as Henry Tudor . This splendid actor was on the very cusp of becoming a major star at the end of the silent era ; although gifted with a fine speaking voice , he was never able to achieve his full potential in talking films . Movie mavens will recognize uncredited appearances by both Robert Greig as a friendly priest & Nigel de Brulier as the archbishop who marries little Edward V . Universal gives the film a fine gloss , with good atmospherics . The exterior London scenes look impressive on the screen . The film presupposes a certain amount of intelligent knowledge to already be in the hands of the audience . Indeed , a working acquaintance with the facts surrounding the Wars of the Roses & the English Line of Succession could only be of help to the viewer in unraveling the intricate plot . TOWER OF London should be enjoyed as entertainment , not accepted as historical fact . Modern research is slowly overturning many of the old beliefs concerning Richard of Gloucester . As a result , he is emerging as a far less bloody individual and one who may have been pilloried for centuries by an unfriendly press . Shakespeare , it should be remembered , was writing for the Tudors - who may have had their own dark ancestral deeds to hide . Indeed , there is much creditable speculation that it was actually Henry Tudor who had the young Tower Princes murdered .
438114	306861	20049	10.0	Mickey's Musical Menagerie	A Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE Cartoon . Mickey shows true JUNGLE RHYTHM in the wilds , making merry music using the bodies of various & sundry creatures . This early black & white Mouse film is almost completely plotless , its action entirely driven by the soundtrack . Music mavens will recognize ' The Blue Danube , ' ' Aloha Oe ' & ' Yankee Doodle ' among other tunes . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
438177	306861	27686	10.0	An Enjoyable Ride , But No Brass Ring	Warner Bros . trots out its Gold Diggers concept again in this amusing little musical which serves largely as a wistful reminder of the fun & vivacity of the original pre-Code feature . Perhaps Dick Powell's smarmy little mustache , seen immediately after the opening credits , should have been enough to signal that things were different now . The plot of every Gold Digger film is centered around its music . The songs here are pleasant , but unmemorable and the Busby Berkeley spectacle - - ' All's Fair In Love And War ' - - reveals the Master at his repose , his choreographed rocking chairs and banners not quite registering the requisite pizzazz one remembers from his earlier classics . Powell tries his hardest to ingratiate , but his preppy days appear to be passing and casting him as an insurance salesman is a bit of a ho-hum . Lots of fun , however , can be found with Warner's two sensational brassy blondes , Joan Blondell & Glenda Farrell , in their final film together . Still wisecracking & sassy , they grab the movie's best dialogue and run off with it , giving some laughter to their comedy duo swan song . Comic Victor Moore shines as a cranky impresario with a bad case of hypochondria . Sharp-eyed movie mavens will spot Fred ? Snowflake ' Toones as a shoe shine attendant ; Jane Wyman as an excited chorus girl at the station ; and Frank Faylen as a man shaving on the train , all unbilled .
438038	306861	30192	10.0	A Scientific Western	A mining engineer , caught between a mighty gold syndicate and a group of stubborn ranchers , learns that GOLD IS WHERE YOU FIND IT when he meets the beautiful daughter of a powerful landowner . Warner Brothers had great hopes for this lavish Western , and the money that was spent certainly shows up on the screen . Unfortunately , the romantic attraction between stars George Brent & Olivia de Havilland never catches fire . This is largely the fault of the script , which seems strangely aloof from their involvement and makes their love scenes rather pedestrian . Alas , real life can be much the same way . . . In this case it is important to look at what strengths the film possesses . Chief among these is master actor Claude Rains , in a suave performance as Olivia's determined , courageous father . With his rich , silken voice , he could have simply read the script directly into the camera and made it compelling . Always a treat to watch & listen to , the movie is fortunate to have him . Good support is given by young Tim Holt as Rains ' amiable , tragic son ; Harry Davenport as a friendly old doctor ; Gabby Hayes & Willie Best as employees of Rains ; and Sidney Toler & Barton MacLane as the murderous syndicate president and mine foreman . The Technicolor photography - still rare & wonderful in 1938 - is pleasant on the eyes . The massed attack on the mine is well handled & exciting . Viewers of the film are likely to hear more about hydraulic gold mining than they ever knew before . Indeed , the environmental problems which the film depicts , with the immense runoff fouling the downstream waters & farmlands , are quite accurately depicted . The Golden Moon Mine in the movie could have easily been based , in part , on the great Cherokee Mine in Northern California's Butte County . Located at the base of Table Mountain , between the towns of Chico & Oroville , the Cherokee Mine attracted Argonauts from around the world ( as its cemetery still attests ) and became the largest hydraulic mining enterprise on earth . Nearby Butte Creek was dammed to provide a 300 acre supply of water for the Mine ( three smaller reservoirs were also created ) . Over 100 miles of conveyance were constructed to move the water to the Mine , where each day forty million gallons were needed for the eighteen immense monitors which directed their gush at the side of the Mountain . Sluices nine miles in length were ready to catch the particles of gold washed down from the bluff . In its few years of operation - 1880 until 1887 - two and a half million dollars worth of gold was found , as well as small amounts of platinum , topaz and even diamonds . Eventually the gold played out and the Mine was no longer cost effective to remain open . To this day , the scars still remain on the side of Table Mountain as mute witness to one of the engineering marvels of the 19th Century .

Wild & wonderful , this little extract from MELODY TIME ( 1948 ) allowed the Disney animators free rein to go wherever their imaginations carried them . Very fast moving . The music is a swing version of " The Flight of the Bumblebee " by Nicolai Rimski-Korsakov . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle .

437869	306861	33634	10.0	Comedy With A Touch Of Class	A FREE AND EASY father and son are dependent upon the largess of rich ladies to continue living comfortable lives . Running less than an hour , this bit of inconsequential fluff is dignified by its fine cast . Nigel Bruce and Robert Cummings ( using a British accent ) are the father and son constantly on the prowl for wealthy women . Cummings provides an honest , appealing performance , as was his wont , while Bruce's usual cuddly persona is not tarnished a bit by his somewhat rakish behavior . Lovely Ruth Hussey is the penniless girl upon which Cummings sets his affections ; fusty , fuming Reginald Owen is her lover who wants no rivals . Marvelous old Sir C . Aubrey Smith appears as a horse-loving Duke who can't keep a secret . Best of all , Dame Judith Anderson plays Sir Aubrey's daughter , a plain-faced woman with an immense amount of money who dotes on Cummings . Portraying a female experiencing unexpected joy and terrible disappointment , Dame Judith gives the kind of beautiful performance one doesn't expect to find in a rather negligible comedy . Having displayed her formidable talent the year before in Hitchcock's REBECCA , and even though possessed of one of the Century's most remarkable speaking voices , it became quickly obvious that Hollywood really wasn't big enough to showcase her properly . Her greatest triumphs would be on the stage . This is a remake of MGM's BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK ( 1932 ) , which also starred Sir C . Aubrey Smith , along with Robert Montgomery , as the father / son duo . MGM had previously used the title FREE AND EASY in 1930 for a comedy starring Montgomery and Buster Keaton .

We begin our cinematic tour IN THE VALLEY OF THE RHINE with a stop in Cologne for a look at the mighty Cathedral . Then it is on to Bonn , where we are shown the birthplace of Beethoven . In Koblenz we are taken to a lively wine garden to watch the dancing & hear the orchestra .

We pass quaint villages & see the beautiful vineyards which extend right up the steep slopes . After seeing several castles , we end our short tour near the rock of the Lorelei , where Teutonic legend & the music of Richard Wagner hold sway . This is one of a large series of succinct travelogues turned out by MGM , beginning in the 1930's . They featured Technicolor views of beautiful & unusual sights around the globe , as well as vivid , concise commentary . These films were produced & narrated by James A . FitzPatrick .
438180	306861	24359	10.0	Ruggles & Merkel Spark Mystery Thriller	An amateur crime ? deflector ' finds his skills put to the test aboard a transcontinental train when there's MURDER IN THE PRIVATE CAR . All of the much-loved elements of the Old Dark House spook films can be found in this regrettably obscure little thriller - - damsels in distress , mysterious legacies , strange disappearances , hairy clutching hands , sudden death , terrible menace ( and , for a few delicious moments , a rampaging gorilla ) - - except here it all takes place in the fancy carriage car of a swiftly moving train . The plot moves just as quickly , catapulting the viewer along , with the climax especially fast & furious . The delightfully quixotic humor of comic actor Charles Ruggles is highlighted as his offbeat character relentlessly pursues the solution of the mystery . His bemused encounter with the denizens of a smashed circus train - - camel , kangaroo and MGM's Leo the Lion - - is especially funny . The teaming of Ruggles with pert & perky Una Merkel is inspired . Her sarcastic wisecracks , uttered in that wonderful Southern drawl , are the perfect counterpoint to Ruggles ' wry utterances . The rest of the cast offers good support : Mary Carlisle as a terribly endangered rich girl ; Russell Hardie as her stalwart boyfriend ; Berton Churchill as a slightly stuffy millionaire who's about to face enormous peril ; Porter Hall as a protective lawyer ; and Fred ? Snowflake ' Toones as a terrified train porter . Movie mavens will recognize Sterling Holloway as a gossipy office boy and Walter Brennan as a train yard switchman , both uncredited .
438334	306861	30150	10.0	Lively & Complicated	It will take FOUR MEN AND A PRAYER to save an old colonel's reputation from disgrace . Although its complicated plot is faintly ludicrous , this John Ford film offers plenty of action and some good acting to keep its viewers entertained . The production value is of a high order and there's a generous amount of heroics , which almost makes one forget that there's no really despicable villain to hiss . Barrister George Sanders , diplomat Richard Greene , military pilot David Niven , and Oxford student William Henry are the English brothers who unite to find their father's murderer and clear his good name . All do a fine job with what the script gives them , constantly dashing about and acting terribly energetic , with young Henry more than keeping up with his three better known costars . Greene actually has top billing , but Niven gets the best lines , getting to leaven a good deal of humor into his performance . Lovely Loretta Young does not fare so well . She's given the ridiculous role of a silly rich girl in love with Greene who follows him first from America to England , then on to Argentina and Egypt . Even witnessing a hideous massacre doesn't entirely sober her , as she begins to behave like a junior league Mata Hari to uncover information for the preternaturally patient Greene . One usually expects more than this from John Ford's heroines . The rest of the large cast offers able support , however . Wonderful old Sir C . Aubrey Smith graces his brief role as the men's tragic father . Stalwart Reginald Denny plays a captain with too much information for his own good . Affable Alan Hale has fun with his role as a millionaire arms dealer . J . Edward Bromberg is a squalid little South American general and , in a tiny role , John Carradine plays his suave & dangerous enemy . Blustery Berton Churchill plays the powerful tycoon father of Miss Young's character , while bantam Barry Fitzgerald steals his few moments of screen time as a boisterous little Irishman ready for a good fight .

Peter & Polly , a couple of PECULIAR PENGUINS , share a romance of frigid delights on Antarctica's Penguin Island . Their happiness is soon threatened , however , by the arrival of a ferocious shark . . . A pleasant cartoon with cute characters , but no great significance . This was the type of animation which , by this time , the Disney artists could do in their sleep .

437083	306861	37794	10.0	Another Spooky House For Holmes & Watson	Gathered in THE HOUSE OF FEAR , the members of a strange tontine begin to meet violent & mysterious deaths . Once again , Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's celebrated consulting detective , Sherlock Holmes , tackles the problems pervading an Old Dark House . This time it's the Good Comrades Club and their rapidly dwindling membership , and Universal Studios supplies all the proper atmospherics to provide plenty of chills & suspense . Basil Rathbone , as the cerebral sleuth , and Nigel Bruce , as his amiable sidekick , have already reached perfection in their roles . Rathbone , with his wonderful voice , always commands attention , and Bruce is especially good in the sequence where Watson finds himself alone in Drearcliff House , surrounded by unseen menace . Together , their film partnership has become screen legend . Dennis Hoey returns in the role of Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard , always several steps behind Holmes in his use of deductive reasoning . The seven Good Comrades are played by cherubic Aubrey Mather , gaunt Paul Cavanagh , Holmes Herbert , Harry Cording , and the unbilled Wilson Benge , Cyril Delevanti & Richard Alexander . Also appearing without credit is that most versatile of British character actresses , Doris Lloyd , playing a Scots innkeeper . This film , which was very loosely based on Conan Doyle's The Adventure of the Five Orange Pips , followed THE PEARL OF DEATH ( 1944 ) and preceded THE WOMAN IN GREEN ( 1945 ) .

437659	306861	28141	10.0	An American Travesty	Falsely imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit , THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND tries to maintain his dignity under vile circumstances . This is director John Ford's exciting and passionate tale of real-life Dr . Samuel Mudd , who , having set John Wilkes Booth's broken leg after Lincoln's assassination , was swept up in the hysteria following the President's death . Convicted of conspiracy , Dr . Mudd was sentenced to incarceration at Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas south of Florida , a hellish , mosquito-infested prison where savage brutality was commonplace and escape attempts futile . In one of his best roles , Warner Baxter gives a searing portrait as Dr . Mudd . While some of the plot situations are purely fanciful , Baxter never lets the viewer forget that this is the story of a real man unfolding before us . Whether vociferously proclaiming his innocence , vainly struggling to escape his hideous confinement or valiantly attempting to fight back an onslaught of yellow fever , Baxter is never anything less than completely compelling . Equally fascinating is John Carradine as the sadistic prison sergeant who torments Mudd ; with his gimlet eye and sadistic grin , Carradine sets the seal on the sinister persona he'd project for the rest of his career . The beloved silent Western cowboy star Harry Carey plays the warden of Fort Jefferson with realism & good grace . Gloria Stuart as Mudd's valiant wife and Claude Gillingwater as his fierce old father-in-law give firm support . Vivid character portrayals are given by O . P . Heggie as the prison's doomed doctor , Francis McDonald as Booth and Paul Fix as his accomplice David Herold . A cast standout is Ernest Whitman as Buck , Mudd's faithful field hand who attempts to rescue him . Movie mavens should recognize Jan Duggan & Dick Elliott as the performers on stage at Ford's Theatre and Our Gang's Matthew ? Stymie ' Beard as the lad come to fetch the Doctor to a birthing - all uncredited . Director Ford's love of American history is plainly manifest in this frequently factual film . His reconstructions of the death of Lincoln ( movingly played by Frank McGlynn Sr . ) and the execution of the conspirators all have the look of antique illustrations . The entire film has excellent production values , with the Fort Jefferson sets being particularly well conceived . The film depicts three of Booth's conspirators being executed for the murder . Actually , four individuals were hung on 7 July 1865 : Lewis Powell ( he stabbed & wounded an invalided Secretary of State Seward ) , George A . Atzerodt ( he was assigned to murder Vice President Johnson ) , David E . Herold ( who had accompanied Booth on his flight from Washington ) and Mrs . Mary Surratt ( she owned the boarding house where Booth met with his gang and may have been completely innocent ) . Two other men , along with Dr . Mudd , were given life sentences . The stagehand who held Booth's horse at the back of the theatre was given eight years . And what of the other three people in the presidential box at Ford's Theatre that fateful night ? Already emotionally fragile , Mrs . Mary Lincoln would eventually go mad and have to be placed in an asylum by her son . The Lincolns ' guests were Miss Clara Harris and her fiancé Major Henry R . Rathbone . They would marry , but Henry would also go insane and murder Clara in a fit of rage . Dr . Mudd's health was permanently affected by his time at Fort Jefferson , and , although released , he would die in 1883 , the year of his 50th birthday .

437187	306861	24238	10.0	Sinning Stanwyck Sizzles	The hard-boiled dames locked up at San Quentin State Penitentiary are some of the LADIES THEY TALK ABOUT . Barbara Stanwyck stars in this very enjoyable pre-Code crime drama which takes a Hollywood look at women's lives behind bars . The acting is strictly of the ham variety , with a few histrionics , some heart-string tugging and a surprisingly large dollop of comedy thrown in . Some of the plot developments are absolutely ludicrous , but the viewer should never get bored . Stanwyck is terrific as the female member of a small-time gang of crooks . Prison gives her a chance to get really tough in order to deal with her situation , but the audience always knows that just a few moments with the right man will have her ( rather unconvincingly ) melting like butter . Whether brawling with a vicious inmate , assisting in an escape attempt , or going gunning for the guy she thinks betrayed her , Stanwyck is always right on the money for entertainment value . Three female costars give Stanwyck some great support in the prison scenes . Lillian Roth , as the lighthearted inmate who befriends Barbara , nearly steals the show with her perky personality ; she gives the movie one of its brightest moments when she croons ' If I Could Be With You ' to a fan photo of comic Joe E . Brown . Frowzy Maude Eburne is a hoot as a bawdy former madam who likes to reminisce about her old ' beauty parlor ' from the comfort of her rocking chair . Good-natured Ruth Donnelly is a nice addition , in a small role , as an Irish matron with a big white parrot . Preston Foster , as a reform revivalist who remembers Stanwyck from their childhood together in Benicia , California , gives an earnest performance , stalwart & steady . Lyle Talbot and Harold Huber appear as members of Stanwyck's gang . Elderly Robert McWade makes the most of his performance as Los Angeles ' wily District Attorney . Movie mavens will spot some fine character actors appearing unbilled : rotund DeWitt Jennings as a cagey police detective ; Helen Ware as the no-nonsense prison head matron ; Madame Sul-Te-Wan as Mustard , the sassy prisoner who's terrified of parrots ; Robert Warwick as San Quentin's stern warden . And that's dear Mary Gordon who appears for only a few scant seconds as a laughing white-haired inmate in the Visiting Room .

437693	306861	20902	10.0	Buster Keaton's Talkie Debut	A FREE AND EASY , hapless young man escorts Miss Gopher City , Kansas & her unspeakable mother out west to Hollywood , where they hope to make her a big time movie star . Fate , however , in the shape of a handsome movie actor , intervenes . . . With the end of the Silent Era , and Keaton no longer in control of his own career , FREE AND EASY was to be his first talking picture . While certainly not a classic , it has a certain small charm of its own and Keaton does a valiant job to provide both laughs & pathos . It is really not fair to compare Keaton's sound films with his silent masterpieces . They were two very different art forms . It is great fun to watch Buster stumble about the MGM lot , leaving chaos in his wake wherever he goes . Although there are awkward moments of staging , due largely to the restrictions of the microphone , Keaton's genius still shines through . He is given wonderful support from mammoth vaudeville veteran Trixie Friganza , as the ghastly stage mother . With her booming voice & facile face , she is able to steal scenes even from Keaton . They are hilarious together in their ' Oh King ! Oh Queen ! ' musical number . Lovely Anita Page , as Miss Gopher City , gets small chance to do anything here besides look lovely . But Robert Montgomery , as the movie actor , gets to show-off some of the charm that would very soon make him a major star . Verisimilitude is added to Keaton's chaotic adventures in Hollywood by peppering the scenes with real celebrities from the era appearing as themselves . Movie mavens should have fun spotting them : directors Cecil B . DeMille , Fred Niblo & Lionel Barrymore , as well as Jackie Coogan , Karl Dane , Dorothy Sebastian , John Miljan , Gwen Lee and 1930's top box office male , William Haines . That's Edward Brophy as the Stage Manager .
438230	306861	14142	10.0	Medieval Menace	Deaf and half-blind , THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME , feared & rejected by the people of Paris , becomes the unlikely protector of a poor gypsy girl . Lon Chaney , master of disguise , solidified his celebrity with his portrayal of Quasimodo , the deformed bell-ringer , who is forever cut off from any semblance of a normal life . Although his makeup is certainly horrific , Chaney's role is not really monstrous : he is a lonely human desperately misused by Fate . Chaney's face speaks for him , communicating the tormenting anguish of his soul . While not quite as poignant as Charles Laughton's interpretation 16 years later , Chaney still makes of the role a Silent hallmark which has stood the test of time . There are fairly lengthy segments in which Chaney does not appear and plot elements not explored in the longer Laughton version . Here the story dwells on the gypsy dancer Esmeralda , played by Patsy Ruth Miller , and her burgeoning romance with the brave Phoebus , Captain of the Guard , played by Norman Kerry . Both performers do very well with their ' normal ' roles - - her innocence contrasting well with his initial lust - - even though the viewer is doubtless anxious for the return of the Hunchback . A handful of excellent character actors from the era add their assistance : gaunt Nigel de Brulier as the saintly Archdeacon , defender of the Hunchback ; beefy Ernest Torrence as Clopin , King of Thieves , ruling over the Court of Miracles ; prissy Raymond Hatton as the effete poet Gringoire ; and feeble Tully Marshall as a suspicious Louis XI . Special mention must be made of Universal's splendid attention to detail which they lavished on the film . Most especially commendable is the representation of Notre Dame's West Facade , the only real angle from which the Cathedral's exterior is depicted . To see Chaney clamber down , swinging from pinnacle to gargoyle to statue ; or , to watch Quasimodo defend Esmeralda from the crowd of beggars he thinks has come to kill her , dropping stones , beams and molten metal on their heads below from the Cathedral's ramparts , is to enjoy two of Silent Cinema's great visual moments .
437742	306861	27188	10.0	Blondell & Farrell Are At It Again	Two lady process servers will stop at nothing to do their job - but then one falls in love with the man they are stalking . . . WE'RE IN THE MONEY was the sort of ephemeral comic frippery which the studios produced almost effortlessly during the 1930's . Well made & highly enjoyable , Depression audiences couldn't seem to get enough of these popular , funny photo dramas . Joan Blondell & Glenda Farrell are perfectly cast as the fearless , fast-talking females who will try anything to serve their subpoenas . Although Joan gets both top billing and the romantic scenes , both gals are as talented & watchable as they are gorgeous . Ross Alexander plays Blondell's love interest and he does a very nice job . Remembered now chiefly for his appearance in the classic A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM ( 1935 ) , this talented young man from Brooklyn was gifted with the good looks & acting skills which should have made him a major Hollywood star . Instead , Alexander ended up in mostly forgettable parts in obscure films . Tragically , Ross Alexander died a suicide in 1937 , at the age of only 29 . Hugh Herbert , whimsical & wacky as ever , appears as the girls ' boss . Whether driving a stolen car or piloting a speeding motorboat , he is equally hilarious . Behind him comes a rank of character actors - Henry O'Neill , E . E . Clive , Lionel Stander , Hobart Cavanaugh - all equally adept at wringing every smile out of any situation . Sharp-eyed movie mavens should spot an unbilled Walter Brennan as a witness at the wedding . While never stars of the first rank , Joan Blondell ( 1906-1979 ) & Glenda Farrell ( 1904-1971 ) enlivened scores of films at Warner Bros . throughout the 1930's , especially the eight in which they appeared together . Whether playing gold diggers or working girls , reporters or secretaries , these blonde & brassy ladies were very nearly always a match for whatever leading man was lucky enough to share equal billing alongside them . With a wisecrack or a glance , their characters showed they were ready to take on the world - and any man in it . Never as wickedly brazen as Paramount's Mae West , you always had the feeling that , tough as they were , Blondell & Farrell used their toughness to defend vulnerable hearts ready to break over the right guy . While many performances from seven decades ago can look campy or contrived today , these two lovely ladies are still spirited & sassy .
437447	306861	25223	10.0	Slow Waltz For Two	A crippled dancer and a brash ice cream man show they HAVE A HEART when they become the answer to the other's romantic dreams . This unfortunately obscure little film starts off as a lively comedy , but quickly takes a turn into very serious drama before finally settling into its final shape as a gentle love story - - with a bit of crime action thrown into the mix . The movie will be more than acceptable to those viewers looking for a soap opera with a bit of a punch . Jean Parker is terrific as the valiant young lady whose life is changed forever as the result of a terrible fall . Love finds her in the unexpected form of James Dunn , very good as the quick tempered but good natured fellow who woos her without knowing of her disability . They make a fine on-screen team , each character filling the void in the other's life . Pretty Una Merkel , the Southern belle whose prickly presence perked up many a film project in the 1930's , shines as Parker's tart-tongued friend . Laid-back Stuart Erwin is funny as her card-cheating boyfriend . Samuel S . Hinds plays Miss Parker's kindly doctor . Movie mavens will recognize an uncredited Edward Brophy as Dunn's pal at the ice cream factory .

437756	306861	20950	10.0	A Sneak Peek At Spencer Tracy	A Warner Brothers VITAPHONE Short Subject . Hit by the Depression , THE HARD GUY has to find any means to get food for his wife and tiny daughter . This very brief film is notable only for its look at a young Spencer Tracy , who manages to make something of even this almost evanescent role . Katherine Alexander plays his beleaguered spouse . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios ' feature films .

437036	306861	36191	10.0	Fascist Fantasy	The fabulous exploits of Baron MÜNCHHAUSEN include several wars , numerous plots and beautiful women without number . At the height of World War Two , as the tide was beginning to turn against the Third Reich , Hitler's Minister of Propaganda , Joseph Goebbels commissioned this lavish motion picture as a commemoration of the 25th anniversary of Ufa , the government-run German film association . More importantly , it was also to be a rival of the great fantasy films which had come from the Allied nations , such as THE WIZARD OF OZ ( 1939 ) and THE THIEF OF BAGDAD ( 1940 ) . In that it succeeds brilliantly and needs no comparison to any other film . The film is a great , lighthearted romp as it follows the adventures of the Baron from Prussia to St . Petersburg , Constantinople , Venice and even the Moon . It is fascinating to see the high quality which the Germans were still able to lavish on the picture , even as their Empire was beginning to crumble around them . The production values are of a very high order and the Technicolor photography is sumptuous to the eye . Remarkably , there is no National Socialist propaganda in the film and the War is never mentioned . In the title role , Hans Albers gives a surprisingly sensitive performance for such a robust production . He takes the legendary character and gives the viewer a portrait of a dashing , reflective , amorous , compassionate , resourceful man . Whether riding on a cannonball , ingratiating himself with the Ottoman Sultan , or examining the fantastic flora of the lunar planet , Albers always makes Münchhausen totally believable . All the acting is of a high order , but especially worthy of mention are Ferdinand Marian as the mysterious Count Cagliostro , Brigitte Horney as a flirtatious Catherine the Great , and Gustav Waldau as an aging Casanova . It should be mentioned that this is not a movie for children . Given its European origins it should come as no surprise that MÜNCHHAUSEN is a good deal more libidinous than the standard Hollywood fare of the time . There was a real Baron Karl Friedrich Hieronymus von Münchhausen ( 1720-1797 ) , a German adventurer and teller of tall tales , but he had nothing to do with the book of fictional exploits which borrowed his name , written by Rudolf Erich Raspe ( 1737-1794 ) , upon which this film was based .
437546	306861	206919	10.0	Things That Go Bump In The Night	A Walt Disney Short Subject . Through the millennia mankind has always been interested in - and afraid of - the unknown . His imagination has allowed him to invent colorful explanations for natural phenomena , but still some intriguing questions linger . MAN , MONSTERS AND MYSTERIES is an entertaining little film which briefly looks at the history of man's belief in fantastic creatures and then spends the bulk of the remaining time exploring one of the greatest mysteries of all - the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland . A good deal of information is given , both legendary & factual , eyewitnesses are heard from , scientific evidence is reviewed and the viewers are allowed to form their own conclusions . The film is helped tremendously by the talents of Sebastian Cabot as the friendly narrator and Sterling Holloway as the voice of the animated Nessie .

Breezy & entertaining , this was the sort of film which Warner Brothers created with such ease . Blessed with good acting & fine production values , these pictures were generally guaranteed to be crowd pleasers . As always , Barbara Stanwyck is utterly fascinating to watch . Not only talented & lovely , Stanwyck's great forte was her utter believability in any role she undertook . Here , she looks perfectly natural with a deck of cards in her hand , playing & dealing . Her authenticity is matched by the passion which she displayed with every performance . Her leading men are two of the best : rich boy Joel McCrea & genial crook Pat O'Brien - both do well by their roles .

437737	306861	113692	10.0	A Cinema Pioneer Remembered	Neglected for a century , the aged woman's cinema treasures , like THE LOST GARDEN in a fairy tale , await rediscovery by a new generation . This poignant & thoughtful documentary introduces the viewer to Alice Guy-Blaché ( 1873-1968 ) , finally being acknowledged as the world's first - and for many years , only - female film director . Through the narration of her granddaughter , Adrienne Blaché-Channing , the viewer is introduced to a charming old lady with a remarkable past . Present at the very birth of the cinema in Europe , Guy-Blaché , through a series of fortunate circumstances , went on to direct hundreds of two-reelers in France & America from 1896 to 1920 . Long before talkies arrived in 1927 , she was pioneering the synchronization of motion pictures & sound . Today , tragically , she is virtually forgotten . Artistic flair is used in seemingly integrating interviewees directly into the ancient films . Using tantalizing selections from her surviving films - and a TV interview she granted before her death - the documentary gives a very good summary of Guy-Blaché's importance to the history of the moving picture .

The characters played by Charles King & Anita Page in the original film are given a doggie interpretation , as are two of Arthur Freed & Nacio Herb Brown's best tunes ( ? The Broadway Melody ' & ? ' You Were Meant For Me . ' ) Highlight : A Ziegfeld-style revue complete with tableau , leggy chorines and a Jolson impersonator .

437047	306861	16473	10.0	Another Chaney Chiller	Vowing revenge on the world of ? normal ' people , a sideshow ventriloquist , strong man & dwarf band together as THE UNHOLY THREE . Following Lon Chaney's great film successes at Universal Studios , Irving Thalberg managed to entice the actor to come to MGM . Anxious to repeat the box office bonanzas of Chaney's recent past , Thalberg signed a one-picture deal with Chaney's favorite director , Tod Browning . The resulting film , THE UNHOLY THREE , was such a hit that Thalberg quickly signed Browning for a long-term contract . Based on a story by Tod Robbins ( who would also pen the inspiration for FREAKS ) , Browning would give the film an appropriately menacing atmosphere , with flashes of comedic wit at just the right intervals . A crime caper rather than a horror film , the chills are saved for right near the end with the rampages of a ferocious ape ( actually a chimpanzee , photographed out of proportion ) which no one seems surprised to find in a bird store . While ventriloquism may seem an odd pastime to depict in a silent movie , Chaney made it all seem so sensible . A consummate artist who only now is starting to receive the proper accolades , Chaney did not need to contort limb or face to portray a little old lady . All he needed was a wig & a dress . So well was he received in this role that it was chosen to be remade five years later as Chaney's talking debut . Muscular Victor McLaglen ( a British Army champion athlete ) and tiny Harry Earles ( one of the few adult actors who could disguise himself as a baby ) give very solid support as Chaney's wicked cronies ; much of the favorable outcome of the film is due to them . Pensive Mae Busch scores as the waifish pickpocket allied with Chaney ; this very talented actress would get to shine a few years later in a series of appearances with Laurel & Hardy . In his one scene as a stern judge , Edward Connelly lends his saturnine presence to the proceedings .

437898	306861	27459	10.0	Topnotch Acting Enlivens Lumber Tale	An aging lumber tycoon tries to relive his youth after meeting the hauntingly beautiful daughter of an old friend . Based on the sprawling novel by Edna Ferber , COME AND GET IT is a fascinating love story , filled with action & tenderness and some very good acting . The production values are on a high order , with the authentic logging sequence especially exciting . Boisterous , brash & bold , Edward Arnold portrays the brawling two-fisted lumberjack who pushes himself to the top of the heap , trampling on his one great love in the process . Although completely unbelievable as a young man during the first three-quarters of an hour , this is not a problem as he is never anything less than enjoyable in the role . Miss Frances Farmer , playing a tenderhearted floozy and her own ambitious daughter , has the best film of her career . She is nothing less than radiant and her obvious talent makes her bizarre personal history all that much more tragic . Wonderful Walter Brennan plays Arnold's jovial Swedish pal , in a performance that would catapult him out of cinematic anonymity and earn him the first of his three Oscars for Best Supporting Actor . Seemingly able to play any kind of part - as long as the character was middle-aged or elderly - during his 46 years in movies & television Mr . Brennan would become one of America's most beloved character actors . He died in 1974 at the age of 80 . Almost obscured by the oversized talents around him , Joel McCrea wisely turns in an understated performance as Arnold's quiet , intelligent son ( he invents the disposable paper cup ! ) . His years of solid successes in front of the cameras were adding up and he would soon become a major Hollywood star . A quartet of fine actresses fill smaller roles : Mary Nash as Arnold's neglected wife ; Andrea Leeds as his adored daughter ; Mady Christians as Brennan's sturdy , sensible niece ; and Cecil Cunningham as Arnold's intuitive , sharp-tongued secretary . That's porcine Edwin Maxwell once again playing a bad guy , this time the crooked owner of a lumber camp saloon . The song which is used as the theme for Miss Farmer's characters is ? Aura Lee , ' ( written in 1861 by W . W . Fosdick & George R . Poulton ) a very popular strain on both sides during the War Between The States . Decades later , in the 1950's , Elvis Presley would use the tune for one of his biggest hits , ? Love Me Tender . '

Although a success , Pluto's young family was not to appear in any subsequent film ; at least they were spared the indignities heaped upon the real life Dionne Quintuplets of Ontario , Canada ( born in 1934 ) , who are being somewhat spoofed here . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings .

437904	306861	20724	10.0	Ramon Novarro Behaves Like A Cad	A brash cantina singer in Sevilla heeds the CALL OF THE FLESH when he romances a young postulant from a nearby convent . Sometimes movie studios make most unwise decisions , resulting in ramifications that can be quite detrimental to the careers of even their biggest stars . CALL OF THE FLESH is a case in point . Good production values & fine performances can not save this film from its one fatal flaw : it is difficult to like , or even tolerate , the hero . Ramon Novarro , usually quite the pleasant fellow , here is forced to play a repellent rogue who quickly irritates the audience with his cruel treatment of those who love him most . Oozing a smarmy charm , he alternately smirks & pouts his way through the plot , until his eventual - and much belated - regeneration . Novarro's undoubted acting abilities enable him to deliver a fine performance , but mischievousness mixed with too much meanness can result in viewer apathy . This did not help his career . The fad for the Latin Lover was wearing mighty thin already and would soon be completely eclipsed by the All American Hero , and Novarro's sexual ambiguity was always a bit of a problem for the MGM front office . The advent of Sound , while finally revealing his strong singing voice , also exhibited his Mexican accent , making it difficult to cast him in traditional roles . The Studio simply couldn't come up with a definitive screen persona for him , and so Novarro was made into their ethnic chameleon , playing everything from Chinese to Arab to Navajo . Novarro's costars come through very well . Dorothy Jordan is radiant as the innocent young woman who loves him with every fiber of her being ; she delivers a heart touching , memorable performance . Flamboyant & hammy , Scottish actor Ernest Torrence is terrific as Novarro's friend & mentor - although one has to wonder just why he was willing to put up with so much nonsense from the little squirt . Equally adept at drama or comedy , Torrence's theatrical mannerisms and the contortions of his great homely face make him both entertaining to the audience and an enjoyable contrast to handsome Novarro . French actress Renée Adorée , in her final film , stirs up the flames in her role as Novarro's musical partner & lover . ( Ill health would bring about the early deaths of both Torrence & Adorée in 1933 - he at 54 and she at 35 . Today , these two fine performers are virtually forgotten . ) Mention should be made of Mathilde Comont , hilarious as a rotund little diva turned landlady . Novarro is in good voice throughout , which is fortunate as the plot keeps him singing interminably .

437183	306861	22700	10.0	Art Imitates Life	Marion Davies stars in this poignant MGM drama , directed by Edmund Goulding , which features excellent performances but is relentlessly downbeat . Writers Frances Marion & Anita Loos , two of the very best , really drag their characters through the Slough of Despond , piling emotional outburst upon painful heartache almost without relief . The writers also give Miss Davies a most curious scenario : that of a lively , vivacious showgirl , not very good at holding her liquor , who , as the mistress of a wealthy , older tycoon , is settled into a life of luxury . Sound familiar ? As the girlfriend of William Randolph Hearst , the nation's most powerful media mogul , and the chatelaine of San Simeon , America's most lavish private estate , Davies must have noted , and been amused by , the script's odd similarities to her own life . Billie Dove gives a fine performance as Davies ' oldest friend and bitterest rival , an insecure woman consumed by jealousy . Suave Robert Montgomery plays the object of both ladies ' affections and he is both polished and sophisticated . James Gleason steals a few scenes as Davies ' loving , work-weakened father . The incomparable ZaSu Pitts shines in the small role of Davies ' no-nonsense older sister . Sidney Toler ( a future Charlie Chan ) is her affable , lazy husband . Sinister Douglass Dumbrille plays a lecherous tycoon who likes blondes . Jimmy Durante appears very late in the film and then only in one scene , essentially playing himself as a guest at a Davies party . His lowbrow humor is a wonderful tension reliever , especially during the few moments he and Davies spoof John Barrymore & Garbo in GRAND HOTEL , which Goulding had directed earlier that same year . It's a shame Durante doesn't get to interact with Miss Pitts , but just having him around for five minutes is a real spirit lifter . Movie mavens will recognize Charles Williams & Billy Gilbert , both uncredited , as the sleazy producers who entice Miss Dove in the film's opening scene .
438102	306861	42680	10.0	A Duck Tale With Danger	A Walt Disney DONALD DUCK Cartoon . Bad behavior from Donald's Nephews draws the unwanted attention of a hungry Mountain Lion . Huey , Dewey & Louie are up to their usual high jinks again in LION AROUND , a fairly routine , albeit humorous , little film . Coupled with the Mountain Lion ( making one of his infrequent Disney appearances ) they provide poor Donald with almost more antagonists than he can handle . Clarence " Ducky " supplies he voices for the entire Duck family . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
437543	306861	194340	10.0	Diving For Pearls	An MGM Short Subject . Braving great perils , Tahitian boatmen paddle their spindly SEA SPIDERS out to harvest valuable pearl oysters . This very brief documentary film takes the viewer to idyllic Tahiti and shows us a bit of the indigenous culture , with slightly ironic narration . The gathering of coconuts for copra is shown , but most of the footage deals with the pearl divers , who must fend with collapsed lungs and dangerous denizens of the deep to win their prize . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios ' feature films .
437376	306861	22696	10.0	Not The Nadir	A brash tabloid columnist turns his BLESSED EVENT style of gossip mongering into a sensation , but creates many enemies along the way . This is the film that made Lee Tracy an authentic movie star - the role and the actor were perfect for each other . For the next couple of years Tracy would specialize in fast talking shyster lawyers , agents , reporters & flimflam men . In the process , he became one of the most enjoyable performers of the era , always fresh & entertaining . However , after misbehaving in Mexico while under contract to MGM , he would be banished to the Poverty Row studios to continue acting in minor films . Today , regrettably , he is almost forgotten . But in pre-Code BLESSED EVENT Tracy is at the top of his form : exasperating , maddeningly irritating & wonderfully funny . Warner Brothers gives him an excellent supporting cast to bounce off of - acerbic Ned Sparks as a disgruntled tabloid reporter ; peppy Frank McHugh as an overeager publicity agent ; porcine Edwin Maxwell as a nasty gangster ; and Allen Jenkins as a softhearted criminal ( his ? electric chair ' scene with Tracy is a classic ) . Boyish Dick Powell , in his film debut , seems an odd choice to play Tracy's nemesis , but there's no doubt about his charm & fine singing style , both of which would soon make him a major movie star . Mary Brian is lovely as Tracy's girlfriend & Emma Dunn is sweet as his mother , but each tends to be a bit smothered by Tracy's oversized personality . His true co-star is tart-tongued Ruth Donnelly as his secretary . No slacker in slinging the dialogue around , she's able to match Tracy line for line . Movie mavens will recognize Charles Lane as a reporter ; Isabel Jewell , terrific as a much-abused showgirl ; and hilarious Herman Bing as a chef - all of them uncredited .
437569	306861	25410	10.0	Shirley's Star Maker	A tiny child , left as an IOU at a race track by her insolvent father , charms her way into the hearts of a group of hard-boiled gamblers . Shirley Temple - not quite six years old - became a full-fledged movie star with LITTLE MISS MARKER . Loaned out to Paramount for the one picture , she emerged as a top of the bill powerhouse prepared to return to Fox Studios and become the most popular performer in Hollywood for the next five years . With genuine talent & an infectious sparkle , she would carve out her unassailable niche in film history . To its credit , the fast moving script allows her to be a little less than saintly , with a normal dose of cranks & crotchets . Even so , her costars , as well as the audience , become her willing slaves in short order . Adolphe Menjou , as the cynical gambler who takes her in , and Charles Bickford as his tough boss , find themselves completely overwhelmed by the mighty moppet . Both of these gentlemen were abundantly experienced actors , used to controlling viewers ' attentions in their screen scenes ; it must have been somewhat odd for them to be reduced to so much stage dressing - but Shirley's ascendant flood swamped all other boats . The Damon Runyon story is well served by the rest of the colorful cast , but it is easy to regret every minute the Small One does not appear on screen . Shirley became quite close to pretty Dorothy Dell , playing a nightclub chanteuse involved with both Bickford & Menjou . The news of Miss Dell's tragic death in a car wreck soon after filming completed was kept from Shirley for some time . Movie mavens will recognize Willie Best as a friendly janitor & Tammany Young as a bettor , both uncredited .
438056	306861	64504	10.0	Let's All Sing Like The Birdies Sing - With Disney	Winging into action , our feathered host leads us on a short flight into the world of all things avian . After learning about the vital impact - yet sad history - of our little flying friends , we are left with the inescapable conclusion that IT'S TOUGH TO BE A BIRD . This delightful Disney cartoon , winner of the 1969 Oscar for Best Animated Short , is great fun . It is most enjoyable to see the antique film clips & to be reminded of the old birdie tunes . But beyond the laughs are some important elements dealing with bird biology & preservation . Ward Kimball , authentic genius , master animator & one of Walt's Nine Old Men , co-authored & directed this short , infusing it with his unique brand of quirky humor . Movie mavens will spot him as the bird watcher holding the tape recorder . Richard Bakalyan does a fine job as the narrator with attitude ; that's Ruth Buzzi hilariously warbling ' When The Buzzards Return To Hinckley Ridge . ' Give yourself a golden goose egg if you can spot Donald Duck .
437735	306861	22659	10.0	A Simple Little Cartoon From The Folks At Disney	A Walt Disney SILLY SYMPHONY Cartoon Short . THE BEARS AND THE BEES are enjoying the beautiful Spring day - the bees making honey & the bear cubs eating it - until the arrival of a fierce , cranky male bear threatens to ruin everyone's morning . . . This black & white cartoon is mostly filled with action / reaction animation and an amazing number of posterior gags . The SILLY SYMPHONIES , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most fascinating of all animated series . Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount , with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music . There was little plot in the early Symphonies , which featured lively inanimate objects and anthropomorphic plants & animals , all moving frantically to the soundtrack . Gradually , however , the Symphonies became the school where Walt's animators learned to work with color and began to experiment with plot , characterization & photographic special effects . The pages of Fable & Fairy Tale , Myth & Mother Goose were all mined to provide story lines and even Hollywood's musicals & celebrities were effectively spoofed . It was from this rich soil that Disney's feature-length animation was to spring . In 1939 , with SNOW WHITE successfully behind him and PINOCCHIO & FANTASIA on the near horizon , Walt phased out the SILLY SYMPHONIES ; they had run their course & served their purpose .
