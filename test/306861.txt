438195	306861	21786	7.0	Ramon Novarro Romance Film of Old Vienna	When a young Imperial Officer offhandedly insults the poor girl he's smitten with , it precipitates her into the arms of a bullying , rich old gambler . Trying to win her back , the Lieutenant becomes greatly in debt to her new lover . Will the young man retain his honor & his life , come next DAYBREAK ? The plot is a bit musty , but the performers do what they can with the material . Ramon Novarro , always a good actor , provides the latest in a series of ethnic impersonations - this time playing a highborn Austrian . Helen Chandler is a pretty love interest , especially good in the Grinzing wine garden scene . Jean Hersholt provides quiet menace as the heavy . As always , Sir C . Aubrey Smith is nothing less than excellent , this time playing a gruff old general - watch him imperiously send an impecunious young officer off to commit suicide . Morally , this is definitely a pre-Production Code movie . Casual sex is implied , much of the action takes place in a fancy brothel and just why is Novarro's manservant wearing Novarro's drawers ?
438192	306861	21780	7.0	A Little William Haines Romantic Comedy	The American nephew of an English nobleman is appalled at the prospect of an arranged marriage . To prove to his uncle that all girls are not sweet & innocent , he disguises himself as his intended's paid dancing companion , to see if she'll have an affair with him . To his surprise , he falls in love with her . When she catches on to the trick , will she acknowledge her hidden love for him , or will she continue to treat him as JUST A GIGOLO ? William Haines , always enjoyable to watch , sparks this little pre-Production Code comedy , in which his silly-billy antics are toned down a bit . He's particularly fun in the climaxing scenes at the San Sebastian Inn , when he thinks Irene Purcell has surrendered a wee bit too far to his charms . Miss Purcell gives a pert performance as a spoiled young noblewoman in need of firm handling . Wonderful old Sir C . Aubrey Smith is excellent as a crusty lord who has much to learn about modern youth , circa 1931 . Haines was one of the art directors on this picture . The following year , with his dismissal from MGM , he would start a new & very successful career as a Hollywood interior decorator .
437755	306861	41867	7.0	No Mutton Tonight	A Walt Disney PLUTO Cartoon . SHEEP DOG Pluto has enough difficulty guarding his flock without the unwanted interference of two hungry coyotes . This little film is fun , but quite unremarkable . The mangy coyotes , Bent-Tail and his none-too-brilliant son , Bent-Tail , Junior , were featured in a short series of Disney cartoons , only to vanish as quickly as they came . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Bambi , Peter Pan and Mr . Toad . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
437055	306861	21703	7.0	Early Disney Animation	A Walt Disney SILLY SYMPHONY Cartoon Short . Toiling together , THE BUSY BEAVERS have devised many ingenious ways to complete their dam . After retiring to their lodges , a mighty flood threatens to wipe out all their hard work . Only one lone beaver has the energy to save the day . . . This black & white entry in the series is an exercise in dealing with the movement of light & dark forms ; action & reaction . The SILLY SYMPHONIES , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most interesting of series in the field of animation . Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount , with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music . There was little plot in the early Symphonies , which featured lively inanimate objects and anthropomorphic plants & animals , all moving frantically to the soundtrack . Gradually , however , the Symphonies became the school where Walt's animators learned to work with color and began to experiment with plot , characterization & photographic special effects . The pages of Fable & Fairy Tale , Myth & Mother Goose were all mined to provide story lines and even Hollywood's musicals & celebrities were effectively spoofed . It was from this rich soil that Disney's feature-length animation was to spring . In 1939 , with SNOW WHITE successfully behind him and PINOCCHIO & FANTASIA on the near horizon , Walt phased out the SILLY SYMPHONIES ; they had run their course & served their purpose .

When his abdomen swells tremendously , Spanky and the Gang are certain he's swallowed some of Butch's ' liquid dynamite ' . Now if they can only get Alfalfa home without his exploding . . . Few real laughs in this otherwise innocuous little film . Made after MGM got direct control of the Gang , and with the kids themselves noticeably growing up , it bears scant resemblance to the Rascals ' classics of yesteryear .

In this " How To " entry , the National Pastime is subjected to much good natured ribbing . The jokes and animation are both fine , though unremarkable . John McLeish narrates in his best documentary style . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings .

At THE BIG PREMIERE , with the neighbor kids in attendance , cinematic chaos ensues . . . Few real laughs in this otherwise innocuous little film .

437309	306861	39080	10.0	Engrossing Tale Of Homicide	THE VERDICT in a vicious murder case impacts the lives of several London citizens . Massive Sydney Greenstreet & diminutive Peter Lorre team once again in another suspenseful crime film from Warner Brothers . This Laurel & Hardy of the Sinister could always be counted on for their good acting and enjoyable scene stealing antics . While two of the movies they made ( in conjunction with Humphrey Bogart ) are undisputed classics , their lesser forays into the shadows are no less welcome . Corpulent Greenstreet portrays a discredited former Scotland Yard superintendent , who , with the aid of eccentric artist Lorre , privately investigates the stabbing of a neighbor . Like a cello and violin duet , these two performers made a delightful team , their very different personas eliciting ominous music from their partnership . British character actress Rosalind Ivan gives a vivid performance as Lorre's hysterical landlady . Others in the supporting cast also acquit themselves well : George Coulouris as Greenstreet's befuddled successor ; Holmes Herbert as the stern head of Scotland Yard ; Arthur Shields as a distressed clergyman ; Morton Lowry as a playboy & Paul Cavanagh as a Member of Parliament , both with secrets to protect ; and little Clyde Cook as a helpful burglar . Movie mavens will recognize an unbilled Ian Wolfe appearing as a murder trial jury foreman .
438262	306861	19563	10.0	Another Triumph From Mr . Lon Chaney	Somewhere WEST OF ZANZIBAR , a crippled magician insanely plots revenge on the ivory hunter who ruined his life . . . Lon Chaney dominates this fascinatingly bizarre little silent movie . More than just a ? horror actor , ' Chaney was a consummate craftsman who , here using a minimum of makeup , could sway an audience with the slightest facial twinge or glance from his haunted eyes . Completely convincing as a cripple , dragging his dead legs behind him across the floor , he becomes more a monstrous aberration than a human being . Lionel Barrymore , Warner Baxter & lovely Mary Nolan all give excellent performances in supporting roles , but this is really Chaney's picture all the way . The fine production values , courtesy of MGM , only enhance its star's dominance of the medium . With Tod Browning , Chaney's frequent collaborator , as director , it is fascinating to speculate how much Chaney's physical performance here later influenced Browning's vision in his masterwork , FREAKS ( 1932 ) .
437028	306861	26262	10.0	A Glimpse Of Hades	An amusement pier attraction based on DANTE'S INFERNO helps change the life of an unscrupulous concessionaire . Spencer Tracy dominates this nifty little drama , which keeps its audience satisfied with good acting and special effects . Two disasters ( the first on the pier and the second aboard a luxury party liner ) add punch to the plot . Between them comes a remarkable 9-minute tour into the depths of the real Inferno , populated by scores of naked extras writhing in anguish . The Depression Era viewers which first saw this film certainly got their money's worth . Tracy , always entertaining as he schemes & plots his way to unsavory success , is well served by his supporting players : lovely Claire Trevor as his loyal wife ; gaunt Henry B . Walthall as Trevor's saintly father ; little Scotty Beckett ( one of the OUR GANG kids ) as Tracy's innocent son ; and Alan Dinehart as a faithful friend . That's Rita Hayworth as the featured dancer aboard the S . S . Paradise .
438239	306861	23814	10.0	A Tour de Force For Mr . Asther	A young missionary finds herself swept into a world of Oriental intrigue & power , after being ? rescued ' by a Chinese warlord . With THE BITTER TEA OF GENERAL YEN , Columbia Pictures & director Frank Capra created a small cinematic gem . Not only does the film boast of superb production values , a first-class script & excellent performances , but it enwraps its audience in a sensual romance which rewards intelligent viewing , while offering a liberal dash of pre-Code sensibilities . Miscegenation , so soon to become absolutely taboo in Hollywood , here is made palatable & attractive , indeed , reasonable , the natural outcome of passions molded by tumultuous times . Although billed second , Nils Asther takes acting honors in the title role . A matinee idol during silent days , Asther found it difficult to find good roles in talking pictures , hampered by his exotic looks which made him hard to cast to his advantage . But with BITTER TEA he found the role of a lifetime . Although tall & Swedish , he completely inhabits the skin of his Asian character , making the General at once believable & sympathetic . His every movement , shift of the eyes , even the way he chews his food are all part of his persona . Nearly forgotten now , Asther shows with this one performance what he was capable of achieving . As the missionary captive , Barbara Stanwyck gives the kind of competent , skillful & engaging interpretation which she would bring to all of her roles over the course of several decades . Capra's favorite actress , the dramatic flames she lights are an intriguing counterpoint to the repressed emotions of Asther's Yen . Loud , brash Walter Connolly , as the General's financial advisor , makes a good contrast to Asther ; his plainspoken character often gives voice to what the others are thinking . Lovely Toshi Mori graces the role of the General's unfaithful concubine . A young Richard Loo is her secret lover . Movie mavens will recognize Clara Blandick in the role of the feisty missionary hostess at the beginning of the film & Willie Fung as the rebel train engineer , both uncredited . While meant to be funny and introduce the plot , the opening scenes are a bit unfair to Western missionaries in China , portraying them as rather fatuous , repressed & gossipy . By in large , missionaries lived lives full of self-sacrifice & devotion . In return , not a few were rewarded with penury and an early grave . That today the ? Underground Church ' in China numbers many millions of Christian believers stands as a witness to the faithfulness of these good people . The era of the Chinese warlord - such as General Yen in the film - was brief but colorful and extremely violent . The Qing dynasty , China's last , was overthrown in 1911 and the Republic of China was formed . Its despotic president , Yüan Shih-kai , relied more on military force than democratic principles to maintain his authority over China's vast stretches & huge population . Upon his death in 1916 , the country was thrown into confusion & chaos , with numerous military officers & powerful bandit kings all using their armies to control districts and even whole provinces , constantly warring with each other amid a swirling sea of ever-changing alliances and bitter feuds . Foreign powers ( Soviet Russia , Imperial Japan & Great Britain ) only made matters worse by supporting various factions . It was the ordinary Chinese citizen who suffered most , with the depredations of war's brutality & the inevitable famines rained upon them . It was not until 1928 , with the capture of Peking by Republican General Chiang Kai-shek , and the reunification of China , that the power of the warlords was finally broken .
437617	306861	23825	10.0	Comic Riot With Miss Jean Harlow & Mr . Lee Tracy	Lola Burns is Hollywood's greatest Blonde BOMBSHELL - but her life is a chaotic wreck thanks to eccentric relatives , sassy staff and studio publicity director Space Hanlon . Jean Harlow & Lee Tracy are wonderfully matched in this pre-Code Comedy , one of the funniest films of the 1930's , and another proof - if one was needed - that Hollywood had an endless appetite for self-ridicule . With her platinum hair and couturier's parade of billowy fashions , Harlow is still essentially playing a parody of her own unhappy private life . Her constant high-decibel groans of complaint as to her celebrity's misuse at the hands of those closest to her have the ring of veracity . And no one gives her greater grief than Tracy , who is determined to wring every last drop of publicity out of her , even if his meddling in her personal life drives her insane . Immovable object meets irresistible force . Result : laughter . A most impressive gathering of character actors appear in the supporting cast : sturdy Pat O'Brien as Harlow's director pal ; delightful Frank Morgan as her dyspeptic father ; Ted Healy as her shiftless brother ; Una Merkel as her conniving secretary ; and Louise Beavers as Harlow's plain talking maid . Franchot Tone adds a touch of class to the proceedings as a sophisticated fellow who takes a shine to Harlow ; Mary Forbes & marvelous old Sir C . Aubrey Smith are his wealthy parents . Ivan Lebedeff gives some laughs as a penniless marquis who is happy to live off of Harlow's money . Movie mavens will recognize boxing champ Primo Carnera in the opening montage ; Greta Meyer as Harlow's masseuse ; Gus Arnheim as the Coconut Grove band leader ; Ethel Griffies as one of the orphanage representatives ; and Billy Dooley as the lunatic who claims Harlow is his wife - all uncredited . Although the action takes place in the imaginary Monarch Studios , all the real stars & films mentioned are pure MGM . This was one of five films Lee Tracy made for MGM in 1933 ( CLEAR ALL WIRES ! , THE NUISANCE , TURN BACK THE CLOCK , DINNER AT EIGHT , BOMBSHELL ) , and arguably the best role of his career . It was certainly the culmination of nearly all the other roles he'd had over the past couple of years in various studios , where he'd perfected the depiction of shyster lawyers , unscrupulous talent agents , snoopy reporters & disreputable gossip columnists . There is certainly no telling how far he might have gone with MGM , but his career literally went south in 1934 after a few moments of drunken indiscretion . While in Mexico for location shooting for VIVA VILLA ! , Tracy stepped out onto his hotel balcony and urinated on a passing military parade . He was immediately arrested and deported from the country . Embarrassed & furious , Louis B . Mayer fired him instantly from MGM . With only the smaller studios willing to hire him , Tracy's film career largely slipped into obscurity . Years later , no longer young , he did some television work . He had a short comeback , of sorts , in 1964 , when he was nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar for THE BEST MAN . This was to be his cinematic swan song ; old and tired , he no longer resembled the hot shot who delighted audiences in the early 1930's . Lee Tracy died in 1968 of cancer , at the age of 70 .

437243	306861	43890	10.0	Master Of All He Surveys	A Walt Disney DONALD DUCK Cartoon . Donald wants nothing OUT OF SCALE in his elaborate backyard model railroad and town - including Chip ' n ' Dale and their tree . Here is another typical Duck versus Chipmunks film - fun & fast-moving , but no classic . The cartoon is rare in that amity reigns over all at the conclusion . Clarence Nash provides Donald with his unique voice ; the Chipmunks are largely unintelligible . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle .

When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan .

437204	306861	35088	10.0	A Lighthearted Look At Serious Problem	An MGM Short Subject . Who's that boorish fellow , with his constant negative talk about our Allies and the War effort ? Why , it's MR . BLABBERMOUTH ! This little film uses a humorous approach to illustrate a problem nagging the country . It is not , as the title might suggest , a ' Loose Lips Sink Ships ' lecture , but rather how to deal with those Americans who constantly brought down the morale of others by their pessimistic attitudes about our fight against the Axis . It is just as pertinent now as it was then . After Pearl Harbor , Hollywood went to war totally against the Axis . Not only did many of the stars join up or do home front service , but the output of the Studios was largely turned to the war effort . The newsreels , of course , brought the latest war news into the neighborhood theater every week . The features showcased battle stories or war related themes . Even the short subjects & cartoons were used as a quick means of spreading Allied propaganda , the boosting of morale or information dissemination . Together , Uncle Sam , the American People & Hollywood proved to be an unbeatable combination .
437983	306861	26120	10.0	A Heavenly Performance From Edmund Gwenn	THE BISHOP MISBEHAVES , perhaps just a little , when he sets aside his ecclesiastical duties to attempt solving a puzzling robbery in a neighboring pub . This is a splendid little crime comedy from MGM , sadly neglected , which boasts fine production values and , most especially , delightful performances from a small constellation of first-rate character actors . Edmund Gwenn - in his American movie debut - is charming in the title role , a small , cherubic cleric who loves to read detective novels . Incisive & methodical , he misses very little and faces danger with bubbling enthusiasm . Watching him deal with an assortment of villains is great entertainment . Lucile Watson , as his elderly sister , also plays her part with a superb sense of fun . As the romantic interests , Maureen O ' Sullivan & Norman Foster add a fine comedic flair to their roles . Here's a pair of lovebirds who don't mind getting involved in theft & kidnapping - for a good cause . ( Mr . Foster would eventually become a director of fine repute , associating with Orson Welles & Walt Disney . ) Reginald Owen makes a marvelous , blustery bad guy . Robert Greig , instead of portraying one of his usual plumy butlers , surprises as a Limehouse lowlife who enjoys needlepoint while plotting crimes . Clicking , chittering Etienne Girardot is hilarious as Gwenn's nervous amanuensis . Lilian Bond , Dudley Digges & Melville Cooper round out the excellent cast . If only the Church of England could have more bishops like Edmund Gwenn . . .

A lively retelling of the Biblical story . The large menagerie of animals are fun to look at and must have kept the animators very busy . Most Sunday School lessons would not include the rabbit & dog gags with which Disney ends the cartoon . The SILLY SYMPHONIES , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most fascinating of all animated series .

437308	306861	26139	10.0	Brown's Peak	Dazzled by the BRIGHT LIGHTS of Broadway success , a burlesque actor is blinded as to what's really most important in life . The film career of Joe E . Brown , Warner's rubber-faced comedian , essentially reached its zenith in this very enjoyable little comedy / drama obviously tailored for Joe's considerable skills . All too soon a change of studios would sidetrack Brown into cheaply made movies which would inevitably dim his celebrity . But here , in this backstage show biz story , his talents may still be enjoyed at full throttle . Although the movie was directed by Busby Berkeley , it includes none of his celebrated dance extravaganzas , focusing instead on personality rather than pulchritude . The film is fortunate in that Brown , presented as a Broadway star , is genuinely funny when engaging in his slapstick humor . Whether dangerously balancing on a balcony rail as part of his stage act , using his tremendous mouth to great advantage while telling a party story about a ' little mousie , ' or engaging in impressive nightclub acrobatic stunts with The Maxellos , Joe is never less than hilarious . Although the focus is firmly on Brown , he is given able support from the rest of the cast : Ann Dvorak as his patient , long-suffering wife ; Joseph Cawthorn as a fatherly theatrical troupe manager ; William Gargan as an energetic press agent ; and lovely Patricia Ellis as a stage bound heiress . William Demarest appears for a few seconds as a determined detective . Best of all is Arthur Treacher , wonderful as Brown's impeccable new valet . Movie mavens will recognize sour faced Clarence Wilson as a train station clerk .

438313	306861	213622	10.0	Do We Hear Wedding Bells ?	An MGM PETE SMITH SPECIALITY Short Subject . While THE DOMINEERING MALE may think the romantic initiative is all his , it's often the female who's doing the real conniving . This bit of typical Pete Smith zaniness takes a humorously cynical look at a wily woman's for-profit relationship with the man she intends to marry . The poor sap probably doesn't stand a chance . . . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios ' feature films .
437775	306861	23948	10.0	An All-Star Classic	A flamboyant old actress with memories of lovers long dead . An alcoholic actor desperate for one more chance on the stage . An Oklahoma tycoon and his below-the-tracks , tough as nails wife . A philandering doctor and his faithful wife . They're all invited to meet tonight at the mansion home of a dying industrialist and his flighty , society-obsessed wife for DINNER AT EIGHT . Following the great success of GRAND HOTEL in 1932 , MGM & producer David O . Selznick embarked on producing an even greater all-star triumph . They succeeded . DINNER AT EIGHT takes a first class list of performers at the top of their form ( Marie Dressler , John Barrymore , Lionel Barrymore , Wallace Beery , Jean Harlow , Billie Burke ) and seamlessly , if a bit implausibly , weaves a plot full of comedy & tragedy which allows each star to strut their stuff . Dressler was Hollywood's top star at this time and she is wonderful , fingering her jewelry - each piece a remembrance of an ancient romance . She has only one scene with gorgeous Harlow and that comes at the very end of the film , but it's a classic . The rest of the cast is a wonderful grab bag of talent : peppery Lee Tracy , elderly Louise Closser Hale , gentle Jean Hersholt , as well as Phillips Holmes , Edmund Lowe , Karen Morley , Madge Evans , Grant Mitchell , Elizabeth Patterson , May Robson , Herman Bing . Take a moment to consider Edward Woods , playing Eddie the bell boy . The year before at Warner Brothers he had traded roles with James Cagney in a little picture called PUBLIC ENEMY . Cagney became an instant , huge celebrity . Woods continued to play bell boy roles . . .
437056	306861	23949	10.0	Wheeler & Woolsey Journey Into A State Of Confusion	A pacifistic Indian tribe sends two zany barbers to be its envoys at the Peace Conference in Geneva . The DIPLOMANIACS soon find themselves up against the machinations of spies working for a powerful munitions company who have a vested interest in seeing that war continues the demand for their explosive bullets . Wheeler & Woolsey take a plot ridiculous even by their standards and manage to get some solid laughs out of it . The Boys ( Bert Wheeler is the little fellow with the curly hair ; Robert Woolsey is the skinny guy with the cigar & glasses ) are always tremendous fun to watch , but the viewer who tries to find anything meaningful or coherent in this film would be wasting their time . However , in its own goofy way , DIPLOMANIACS holds its own against DUCK SOUP & MILLION DOLLAR LEGS , two contemporary films with which it shares an hysterical point of view . The Boys are given a fine supporting cast , each of whom get to shine for a few moments , as they are given no chance for any real character development : Louis Calhern as the suave master spy ; Edgar Kennedy as the harried head of the Peace Conference ; elderly Richard Carle as an inebriated ship's captain ; spunky little Marjorie White as Wheeler's violent love interest , choking him into submission ( a very funny comedienne nearly forgotten today , a tragic car wreck would claim her life two years after the release of this film ) ; and Hugh Herbert as an inscrutable proverb-spouting Oriental . Movie mavens will spot Charlie Hall as an eager beaver valet . Wheeler & White fight their way through ' Sing To Me ' - while the Boys vocalize with ' On The Boulevard ' and ' No More War . '
437667	306861	21742	10.0	Disney's Tale Told Under The Blue Willow Tree	A Walt Disney SILLY SYMPHONY Cartoon Short . THE CHINA PLATE on the shelf has much to tell , if you examine the picture on its face carefully . There you'll find the story of a dreadful old mandarin who forbids the love of his daughter for a simple fisherman . . . An interesting black & white cartoon , which alternates between action / reaction antics & the plot of the romantic story . The animation is stylized to look somewhat like a blue willow pattern plate . Quite a few racist elements in the story . The SILLY SYMPHONIES , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most interesting of series in the field of animation . Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount , with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music . There was little plot in the early Symphonies , which featured lively inanimate objects and anthropomorphic plants & animals , all moving frantically to the soundtrack . Gradually , however , the Symphonies became the school where Walt's animators learned to work with color and began to experiment with plot , characterization & photographic special effects . The pages of Fable & Fairy Tale , Myth & Mother Goose were all mined to provide story lines and even Hollywood's musicals & celebrities were effectively spoofed . It was from this rich soil that Disney's feature-length animation was to spring . In 1939 , with SNOW WHITE successfully behind him and PINOCCHIO & FANTASIA on the near horizon , Walt phased out the SILLY SYMPHONIES ; they had run their course & served their purpose .
438039	306861	122748	10.0	A Tiny Treasure	A much abused young man , driven to desperation & murder , hears his conscience rebel in the beating of THE TELL-TALE HEART . Edgar Allen Poe's story is turned into a short subject gem , with the magnificent performance of Joseph Schildkraut & the inspired direction of Jules Dassin . This is a prime example of what can be done in a very limited time frame - here , 20 minutes - when inspiration & bravado are used to interpret a great story . The original has been altered & expanded somewhat to explain more fully the reasons for the murder and to create sympathy for the killer . Schildkraut's depiction of growing guilt & Dassin's creation of an oppressive atmosphere do the story more than justice . Dassin would go on to become a celebrated features director . Schildkraut , already an Oscar winner , would enliven cinema & television roles with his talent for many years . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel .

When he succeeds in bringing a highly destructive comet upon Metropolis , and with intrepid reporter Lois Lane in harm's way , only Superman can stop the chaos caused by THE MAGNETIC TELESCOPE . This was another in the series of excellent cartoons Max Fleischer produced for Paramount Studio . They feature great animation and taut , fast-moving plots . Meant to be shown in movie theaters , they are miles ahead of their Saturday Morning counterparts . Bud Collyer is the voice of Superman ; Joan Alexander does the honors for Lois Lane .
437031	306861	156602	10.0	Heart Facts	A Frank Capra WONDERS OF LIFE film . Keeping the blood pumping through our veins is the responsibility of hardworking HEMO THE Magnificent . In the mid-1950's , AT & T and Bell Science teamed with famed Hollywood director Frank Capra to produce a series of CBS television science films to educate the public about the Universe around them . A far cry from the dreary black & white fodder so often foisted off on young scholars , the Capra films would both instruct and entertain with lively scripts and eye-catching visuals shown in Technicolor . The four films - OUR MR . SUN ( 1956 ) , THE STRANGE CASE OF THE COSMIC RAYS ( 1957 ) , HEMO THE MAGNIFICENT ( 1957 ) , THE UNCHAINED GODDESS ( 1958 ) - quickly became schoolhouse favorites , where they were endlessly shown in 16mm format . The star of the series was Dr . Frank C . Baxter ( 1896-1982 ) , an affable English professor at the University of Southern California . This avuncular pedagogue proved to be the perfect film instructor , genially imparting to his audience the sometimes complex facts in a manner which never made them seem dull or boring . Dr . Baxter , who won a Peabody Award for his achievements , continued making high quality instructional films after the Capra quartet were concluded . HEMO THE Magnificent , which was produced , written & directed by Capra , relates the story of the human heart and blood circulation system , using animation and gentle humor . Film star Richard Carlson appears as the Fiction Writer , energetically helping Dr . Baxter tell Hemo's tale . Movie mavens will recognize Sterling Holloway as part of the TV production crew , and the voices of Marvin Miller , Mel Blanc , June Foray & Pinto Colvig as various cartoon characters , all uncredited . The devotional Scripture which begins the film is completely in tune with the tenor & tone of the production .
437345	306861	23560	10.0	Mr . Brown Comes To Town	A Texas cowboy with funds to invest arrives in New York City . Just how long will it take for THE TENDERFOOT and his money to be parted ? Comic Joe E . Brown has a wonderful time , striding about Manhattan in a ten-gallon hat & boots , packing a pair of six-shooters and carrying a lasso . No hick he , shysters of both sexes find he's not an easy mark - - until he's taken in by a couple of desperate play producers who want to unload 49 % of their latest flop . Brown is a constant wide-mouthed delight , whether roping his luggage at Grand Central Terminal , trying to be neighborly to a bunch of chorus boy cowboys , or galloping after a group of taxi-driven gangsters on a busy New York street , he makes this rather naughty Pre-Code comedy boil . Perky Ginger Rogers scores as a secretary honest enough to want to protect Joe and his money . Lew Cody & Robert Greig ooze false charm as the producers ( Greig even looks a little like the great Mostel ) and brassy Vivien Oakland stirs things up a bit as the play's spoiled star . Movie mavens will recognize Herman Bing as an opinionated chef , Nat Pendleton as a jealous husband and Richard Cramer as a gangster , all three uncredited . The last few seconds of the film , involving some very peculiar triplets , is hilarious .
438164	306861	26423	10.0	Disney Ventures Into The Land of Greek Mythology	A Walt Disney SILLY SYMPHONY Cartoon Short . Jolly monarch King Midas is gold mad and nothing seems to satisfy his avarice . Then one day a strange little elf grants him THE GOLDEN TOUCH . . . An enjoyable retelling of the tale from Greek Mythology , competently animated . The SILLY SYMPHONIES , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most interesting of series in the field of animation . Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount , with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music .

437974	306861	30265	10.0	Literate & Intelligent Entertainment	A cunning king of France allows a rapscallion poet to become Lord High Chancellor - for the space of only one week . . . IF I WERE KING is a fascinating film based on the fictionalized lives of two very real personages , Louis XI and François Villon . The performances are impeccable , Preston Sturges ' script is literate and Paramount Studios provided excellent production values . As Villon , Ronald Colman makes full use of his most magnificent talent - his beautiful speaking voice . Like honey flowing over velvet , it caresses the dialogue & adds emotional heft to the lines of Villon's poetry used in the film . While perhaps a bit mature to swashbuckle altogether convincingly , he plays the lover very creditably in the romantic scenes . Obviously determined not to acquiesce the entire film to Colman , Basil Rathbone is hilarious as King Louis . Gaunt , wizened & cackling like a crone , he effortlessly steals his every scene . Eschewing the use of his own superb speaking voice , Rathbone plays a character that will remind some viewers of the disguises the actor would use shortly as Sherlock Holmes . The sequences between Rathbone & Colman are very enjoyable , especially since in their only other joint appearance , A TALE OF TWO CITIES ( 1935 ) , they had no scenes together . The two women involved in Villon's life are portrayed by Frances Dee & Ellen Drew , one an aristocrat , the other a wench - lovely ladies both . Smaller roles are filled by fine character actors Henry Wilcoxon , Walter Kingsford , Sidney Toler , John Miljan & Montague Love . Way down the cast list is the always reliable Ralph Forbes , playing the king's toady . Movie mavens will spot an uncredited Lionel Belmore playing the Chief Steward of the royal palace . Fat & ugly , Louis XI ( 1423-1483 ) was nicknamed ' the Spider ' as a grudging tribute to his remarkable skills at plotting & scheming . Although he showed talent in administration from an early age , he also was quite adept at angering his father , Charles VII , and ultimately had to take refuge at the Burgundian court until the time of his succession to the throne . Almost universally unpopular , he set up an elaborate spy network which kept him informed as to nearly all that went on in his kingdom . His overriding mission was to crush the power of the great nobles , especially Burgundy - now ruled by the successor to Louis ' former protector - and this he was largely able to do , thanks to his policy of encouraging the minor nobles and the middle class . The might of the French crown was significantly strengthened during his despotic reign . François Villon ( 1431-1463 ? ) was both France's greatest lyric poet and a complete scoundrel & ruffian . Raised by a chaplain , Villon absorbed none of the virtues of the Church , consorting with the basest of companions and involving himself in numerous scrapes , misdeeds & robberies . His murder of a priest during a street brawl was but one of several outrages . Imprisoned many times both in Paris and other French municipalities , Villon was almost preternaturally fortunate in being able to take advantage of various pardons & amnesties - all undeserved . After one final clemency , he was banished from Paris for life - whereupon he completely disappears from the historical record . Although stained by a most unsavory reputation , critics have long admired Villon's poetry and have extolled both the exquisite imagery of his tender verses and the unremitting detail in the poems describing his coarser experiences . The bulk of the tale told in IF I WERE KING is a complete fantasy . There is no indication that Louis XI & Villon ever even met .
437168	306861	91455	10.0	A Milestone For Computer Animation	An indulgent & bemused parent - who just happens to be a desk lamp - watches its child , LUXO JR . , romp with a plastic ball . This tiny film , produced in 1986 , showed the computer animation world what results were possible , even on a small scale , when imagination is unloosed at the keyboard . The personality given to the two character objects is remarkable , especially considering the extremely short running time . Little Luxo would go on to become the corporate symbol for Pixar , who are ranked near the top of the tree in their field of expertise .
437462	306861	32470	10.0	Playing With Fire	A Walt Disney DONALD DUCK Cartoon . Donald Duck , the FIRE CHIEF of Hook & Ladder Company 13 , manages to start a roaring conflagration in his own engine house . Donald gets himself into trouble yet again - with able assistance from Huey , Dewey & Louie - in this well-animated little film . There is a good chance that viewers who have suffered a devastating fire will not find this cartoon very amusing . The story was written by the legendary Carl Barks ; Clarence Nash provides the voices for the entire Duck clan . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that childlike simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
437206	306861	32449	10.0	A Look At The Navy's Wings	A MGM Short Subject . After relentless , rigorous training , young men from around the USA become the EYES OF THE NAVY as pilots of the air arm of the Navy & Marines . Produced well before the entry of America into World War Two , this Short serves as both a plea for preparedness by having a strong air defense , as well as a promotional pitch for the flying fleet . It is interesting in that Uncle Sam's potential enemies ( Germany , Italy , Japan ) are never mentioned by name . After Pearl Harbor , Hollywood went to war totally against the Axis . Not only did many of the stars join up or do home front service , but the output of the Studios was largely turned to the war effort . The newsreels , of course , brought the latest war news into the neighborhood theater every week . The features showcased battle stories or war related themes . Even the short subjects & cartoons were used as a quick means of spreading Allied propaganda , the boosting of morale or information dissemination . Together , Uncle Sam , the American People & Hollywood proved to be an unbeatable combination .
438060	306861	21556	10.0	Disney's Salute To The Seasons , Opus Four	A Walt Disney SILLY SYMPHONY Cartoon Short . It is WINTER , and when not braving the icy winds the forest animals are gliding on the ice . They don't neglect their trip to Mr . Groundhog , though , to get a forecast of the coming weather . . . More action / reaction animation in this black & white cartoon . Also more posterior gags , in dubious taste , from the Disney animators . The bear cub having a face almost identical to Mickey Mouse was probably no accident . The SILLY SYMPHONIES , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most interesting of series in the field of animation .

437961	306861	212084	10.0	A Curious Short Subject	A bemused & rather pixilated Robert Benchley offers up a screen valentine to DAVID O . SELZNICK : YOUR NEW PRODUCER , showing highlights from Selznick's years at Paramount , RKO & MGM . This enjoyable little short is actually a bit of interesting film history . Up until this point , movie producers were rather an anonymous lot , generally not receiving screen credit or much recognition for their contributions . ( Irving Thalberg , for instance , authentic genius & producing guru as No . 2 at MGM , did not receive screen credit until after his death . ) But Selznick was leaving MGM and becoming a very big Hollywood player on his own terms , with his private production company . Hence this little tribute . The recognition would not be misplaced - Selznick's company would eventually become powerful enough to pick the biggest apple on the tree - GONE WITH THE WIND . Benchley's dry wit is most amusing as he cuts the absent Selznick down a peg or two . While he mentions that Selznick was raised in the business - his father was a noted silent film director - he neglects to add that Selznick's marrying Louis B . Mayer's daughter didn't hurt his prospects any , either . Excerpts are shown from the following films : Forgotten Faces ( 1928 ) , The Four Feathers ( 1929 ) , Sarah and Son ( 1930 ) , Street of Chance ( 1930 ) , The Lost Squadron ( 1932 ) , A Bill of Divorcement ( 1932 ) , Bird of Paradise ( 1932 ) , The Animal Kingdom ( 1932 ) , Symphony of Six Million ( 1932 ) , What Price Hollywood ?

437981	306861	24446	10.0	W . C . Fields ' Short Subject Is Long On Laughs	A MACK SENNETT Short Subject . Caught between his frightful female relations on the second floor & the rather odd customers down in the shop , THE PHARMACIST in a small town reacts with predictably irascible behavior . Initially conceived as a skit in 1925 for the Ziegfeld Follies by the inimitable W . C . Fields , THE PHARMACIST become one of a quartet of short subjects produced by Mack Sennett in the early 1930's . Fortunately , Fields was given full rein to control the film as he saw fit . The success of the shorts gave a new glow to Sennett's reputation , as many in Hollywood thought the old comedy master was washed-up with the end of the Silents . For Fields , this was the opportunity to paint large on a small canvas , going straight for the laughs ( based on his unique personality ) without any time wasted on character development or plot complexities . Elise Cavanna plays Fields ' ghastly wife & Babe Kane is his canary-munching daughter . ( Looking enough alike to be sisters , these two actresses were actually only seven years apart in age . ) Grady Sutton has a small role as the much-maligned Cuthbert .
437538	306861	30082	10.0	Rousing Adventure From Another Era	A wicked Khan plans to use THE DRUM perched high up in his palace walls to signal the massacre of British soldiers invited to a banquet . Sir Alexander Korda's London Films was responsible for this lively Technicolor action film which boasted outdoor scenes shot near the North-West Frontier with the assistance of the Mehtar of Chitral . It blends excitement , humor & history - definitely from a British viewpoint - into an attractive package sure to entertain the viewer lucky enough to find it . Indian actor Sabu stars as the young Prince of Tokot who finds his life suddenly become very dangerous when he's forced to flee his usurping uncle and accept protection from the British Raj . Plummy-voiced Roger Livesey plays the Raj's stalwart envoy to Tokot who must find a way to stop the import of weapons to the evil new Khan , Raymond Massey , who is fomenting a rebellion . All three actors play their parts very well , with Massey especially attacking his villainous role with gusto . Also in the cast are Valerie Hobson as Livesey's courageous wife ; David Tree as a junior officer ; and corpulent Francis L . Sullivan as the local Governor in Peshawar . Alfred Goddard appears unbilled as the hapless private Kelly . Born Sabu Dastagir in 1924 , Sabu was employed in the Maharaja of Mysore's stables when he was discovered by Korda's company and set before the cameras . His first four films ( ELEPHANT BOY-1937 , THE DRUM-1938 , THE THIEF OF BAGDAD-1940 , JUNGLE BOOK-1942 ) were his best and he found himself working out of Hollywood when they were completed . After distinguished military service in World War II he resumed his film career , but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films , BLACK NARCISSUS ( 1947 ) being the one great exception . His final movie , Walt Disney's A TIGER WALKS ( 1964 ) was an improvement , but it was too late . Sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963 , only 39 years of age .

DeMille & The Railroad	Moving across the American wilderness , east to west , the mighty UNION PACIFIC Railroad stretches to meet its rival - the Central Pacific - taming a continent with steel rails . Overcoming Nature's disasters , hostile natives & corrupt politicians , the engines bring with them the people whose hopes are inextricably tied into the railroad's success or failure . In 1939 , Hollywood's Golden Year , kingpin director Cecil B . DeMille presented his biggest , flashiest film yet . It was to be nothing less than the story of how the American West was conquered by the great railroads & her indomitable builders . To realize DeMille's vision on the screen , Paramount allocated hundreds of extras & large coffers of money to the project . Authentic rolling stock was acquired . The president of the contemporary Union Pacific enthusiastically sent his finest track layers to work in the film . The movie would boost train wrecks ( two of ? em ) , Indian attacks , assorted villainies & a compelling love triangle . DeMille demanded scrupulous attention to detail and his crowd scenes are very well conceived & produced . His early reels tend to be a bit preachy in touting the virtues of the railroad , but action scenes quickly follow which amply compensate for this . DeMille's subject matter & obvious patriotism help him to avoid the lapses of taste & vulgarities in which he tended to stray in many of his other film forays . Even with a fake Irish brogue , Barbara Stanwyck charms in her role as a railroad postmistress & engineer's daughter . Feisty & volatile , always great fun to watch , it's easy to see why she's loved by both Joel McCrea ( the hero ) & Robert Preston ( the antihero ) . Both gentlemen give good rousing performances in roles that might have strayed into the stereotypical , but never do . Brian Donlevy , as the villain , gives another vivid portrait in what is rather a small role , but very much like the one he would play that same year in DESTRY RIDES AGAIN . Akim Tamiroff & Lynne Overman are especially enjoyable as McCrea's scruffy , rather repulsive security enforcers ; with whip & guns , these are two hombres you wouldn't want to tangle with . Robert Barrat as a murdering bully & Regis Toomey as a sweet-natured Irish worker , give impressive cameos . Anthony Quinn appears for a couple of scenes as a gambler who unwisely pulls a gun on McCrea , and lovely Evelyn Keyes has a scant few screen moments as a telegrapher's wife . Sharp-eyed movie mavens may ( or may not ) be able to spot among the uncredited players Monte Blue , Ward Bond , Iron Eyes Cody , Will Geer , Noble Johnson , Elmo Lincoln & Mala playing various Indians , gamblers or railwaymen . It would be most intriguing to run UNION PACIFIC in a double bill with John Ford's 1924 epic THE IRON HORSE , which tells the same historical story , but with a different artistic tack & fictional characters .
438331	306861	204043	10.0	For Auld Lang Syne	An MGM TRAVELTALK Short Subject . Our trip to the Scottish Highlands includes quick looks at Inverness & Loch Ness , but lingers longest at the ancient capital of Perth , the Culloden Battlefield and St . Andrews Golf Club . Sir Walter Scott , the skirl of bagpipes and a sentimental visit to a golfers ' cemetery are all part of the tour . This is one of a large series of succinct travelogues turned out by MGM , beginning in the 1930's . These films were produced & narrated by James A . FitzPatrick and featured Technicolor views of beautiful & unusual sights around the globe , as well as vivid , concise commentary .
437029	306861	32247	10.0	Undying Friendship	Even after passing BEYOND TOMORROW , three old gentlemen continue to guard their two young friends . Unfortunately rather obscure , this charming little film , bursting with the joy of life , brings a whimsicality as unexpected as finding a ten dollar bill on a snowy sidewalk . Texas rodeo cowboy Richard Carlson and children's clinic worker Jean Parker are the two lonely people brought together on a cold New York City Christmas Eve by their new benefactors . They make a perfect couple , young & eager to embrace love - and each other - with open arms . Their enthusiasm at finding relief from their loneliness is genuine and imparts a special glow to the viewer . The generous trio , who look after their new companions like benevolent uncles , are the very heart of the film . Cheery Irishman Charles Winninger , stalwart English major Sir C . Aubrey Smith , and melancholy Oklahoman Harry Carey , although dealing with their own secret sorrows , share their largess with complete strangers ( whom they meet by a most curious stratagem ) in order to share the Christmas Spirit . Elderly Maria Ouspenskaya gives a sweetly poignant performance as their beloved housekeeper ; this tiny , wizened actress positively radiates joy as she steals her every scene . Helen Vinson , as a singing temptress trying to corrupt Carlson , is the serpent in this garden . Silent Screen star Rod La Rocque , in one of his final films , gives support as Vinson's theatrical manager . This would make wonderful Holiday viewing . In fact , one of the most delightful scenes in the film features a spirited singing of Jingle Bells in English , Russian , German & Italian .

437887	306861	12408	10.0	Heartwarming Mary Pickford / Frances Marion Film	With her love off to war , a young woman operates the lighthouse near her home on the coast of Italy . One day , finding an American seaman washed up on the shore , she takes him home & nurses him . Romance blossoms and they marry . But little does she know that THE LOVE LIGHT she beams to him from atop her tower every midnight will have tragic consequences she cannot begin to imagine . . . While traveling in Italy with her husband , Frances Marion met a woman whose story during The Great War was so compelling that she knew at once it would make a great movie . Marion was a screenwriter on the ascendant and her best friend was motion picture star Mary Pickford . Little Mary , who liked the idea , not only had Frances write it , but direct the film as well . It turned out beautifully , with Pickford - in a daring departure from her little girl roles - giving one of her best performances . Her emotional display at the multitude of troubles thrown her way never wallows into histrionics . One need only look at this film to be assured , if there was ever any doubt , that America's Sweetheart was an excellent artist , as well as a huge celebrity . This movie is also testament to one of the industry's supremely talented women . The Silent Era was a time when women were given enormous freedom to display their gifts in Hollywood , not just as actresses , but also as directors & writers . Frances Marion would not direct many films , but she was the consummate screenwriter . For over two decades she was the world's highest paid individual in her profession , male or female . She was also the first person to receive two Academy Awards . She would eventually write the scenarios for over 150 motion pictures , a large number of which are still considered to be classics . This was the film debut for Fred Thomson , who plays the American seaman . A decathlon champion & Presbyterian minister , he had met Marion during the War . It was love at first sight for both of them & they double honeymooned in Europe with Pickford & Douglas Fairbanks . Not wanting to act , he'd eventually been persuaded to take the part in THE LOVE LIGHT by the two ladies . He proved to be a natural . A very moral man , he would find an outlet for expressing his ethics through Hollywood Westerns . With Thomson rapidly becoming one of the most popular cinema cowboys , he & Marion built a huge mansion in the Beverly Hills and began raising a family . Tragically , Fred Thomson would die on Christmas Day , 1928 , from tetanus caused by a scratch on his ankle from a rusty nail . He was only 38 years old . THE LOVE LIGHT enjoys excellent production values , sets & photography . It has been restored to a pristine condition and will be enjoyed & appreciated for many years to come .
437159	306861	27964	10.0	Grabbing The Bull By The Tail	A Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE Cartoon . A picnic with Minnie is destroyed by the arrival of MICKEY'S RIVAL , the thoroughly obnoxious Mortimer . This excellent little film features both terrific animation & lots of laughs . It is great fun to see the Mouse triumph over both his detested competition and the fierce bull which disrupts their outing . Mickey gets his squeaky voice from Walt Disney , who , it is interesting to remember , first planned on naming his wee buddy " Mortimer . " Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that childlike simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .

Featuring first rate animation & a very funny plot , this classic little film reunites the three buddies in another cartoon not dissimilar to CLOCK CLEANERS ( 1937 ) , their hit of the year before . Goofy & the Duck carry most of the show , with their voice artists - Pinto Colvig & Clarence Nash - giving topnotch performances . Voiced by Walt Disney , Mickey easily steps into the position of good guy & regular fellow . Miss Minnie has a quick cameo and sharp-eyed movie mavens will spot Horace Horsecollar & Clarabelle Cow among the crowd at the launching .

437781	306861	24078	10.0	Hearts Are Trumps	A brilliant Russian émigré devises the ? Stanislavsky ' system for winning at contract bridge - which makes him and his beautiful wife the GRAND SLAM Sweethearts of America . What could have been just another silly soap opera is elevated by fine production values & excellent acting to the status of a very enjoyable little comedy . A few unexpected touches are thrown in to keep the viewer's attention engaged - the way in which the principle cast is introduced as faces on a deck of cards ; the introduction of a zany acrobat into the plot for no other reason than to enjoy a bit of lunacy ; and the way in which a wide variety of different kinds of Americans are shown to be transfixed by listening to the broadcast of the concluding game . Paul Lukas & Loretta Young do very well as the Bridge Sweethearts - Lukas suave & sophisticated and Miss Young passionately loving and beautiful ( even if the script keeps her puffing on a cigarette a bit too much ) . They are fun to watch , even when their behavior is not always the most believable or compelling . Frank McHugh gives another good performance as a relentlessly cheerful ghost writer who adores Miss Young . The delightful Glenda Farrell eschews her customary wisecracking persona in a small role as McHugh's ditsy gal pal . Roscoe Karns handles the fast-talking dialogue as a brash radio announcer . Diminutive Ferdinand Gottschalk is wonderful as a snobbish bridge expert . Movie mavens will recognize Dewey Robinson as a belligerent nightclub patron ; Emma Dunn as a sob sister reporter ; Paul Porcasi as the owner of the Russian nightclub ; Charles Lane as a Russian waiter ; and Jimmy Conlin as a kibitzer at the final bridge game - all uncredited . The film takes advantage of the fad for contract bridge which had swept across the country since its development in the 1920's . It expects the viewer to have a basic knowledge of the intricacies of the game and makes no attempt to explain anything to the uninformed .
437041	306861	24067	10.0	Mr . Crosby Steals Film From Miss Davies	When she discovers that the crooner she adores is GOING HOLLYWOOD , a liberated school teacher dogs his steps all the way to the Studio sound stages . Marion Davies tries her hardest to entertain in this tinsel town spoof , but neither the script ( based on a story by the celebrated Frances Marion ) nor the direction give her much leeway . Raoul Walsh seems a curious choice to direct this kind of film , but he must have had William Randolph Hearst's approval or he never would have been given the assignment . The trouble is that Marion has little chance to be anything other than sweet & pleasant - when finally given the opportunity to do a wicked spoof of co-star Fifi D'Orsay , she's terrific . Unfortunately , moments like that come all too rarely . Leading man Bing Crosby comes off rather better , showing the casual charm that would make him a huge star . And he gets to sing some fine tunes by Nacio Herb Brown & Arthur Freed , including the classic ? Temptation ' and the fun ? We'll Make Hay While The Sun Shines . ' Although his character is a bit of a cad , Bing never fails to deliver the goods to the audience . A troika of character performers add sparkle to the proceedings : earnest Stuart Erwin as a film producer ; caustic Ned Sparks as a dictatorial director ; and tomboy Patsy Kelly as a plain-talking gal trying to break into the movies . Movie mavens will spot Clara Blandick & Nora Cecil as two of the ossified instructors at the girls ' school , and Sterling Holloway as a recording mike technician - all uncredited . Oddly , this film about the Hollywood movie business takes time out to poke fun at contemporary radio stars . Mimic singers & impressionists , The Radio Rogues will provide a smile to viewers with very long memories . Time has not dealt kindly with Marion Davies . Almost forgotten today , when remembered at all it is usually as a sort of footnote to history or object of scandal . Her life certainly was colorful , and as chatelaine of America's most amazing private estate she did circulate amidst powerful circles . But to remember her as only the bimbo blonde mistress of the country's mightiest media baron is patently unfair . While much of the blame can go to Orson Welles ' spoof of Davies in CITIZEN KANE ( which he was to admit he regretted towards the end of his life ) it must be stated emphatically that Marion was not a no-talent actress with few friends & even fewer brains , whose career was destroyed by her stammer , leaving her to spend lonely years in great , hulking empty castles . In reality , Davies was a bright , vivacious lady who charmed & captivated such diverse guests as George Bernard Shaw & Winston Churchill throughout her 33-year liaison with Hearst . Adored by her friends and a fierce cadre of fans , Davies was renowned for her tireless generosity and charitable good works . Her speech impediment never affected her screen acting and her undeniable talent was evident to any who were willing to assess her performances honesty and look past the scandal . Davies had to have been embarrassed by the Hearst empire's relentless pushing of her career . She knew this left her open to ridicule & mockery , doubtless contributing to her scarcely concealed alcoholism . But she eventually relinquished her film pursuits in order to care for the aging Hearst , and after his death in 1951 she showed herself to be an astute businesswoman during the remaining ten years of her life . It is only now , with the passage of much time & the restoration of her old movies , that it is becoming easier to acknowledge the contributions & cinematic expertise of Miss Marion Davies .
438154	306861	12303	10.0	Domestic Difficulties With Mr . Lloyd	A Hal Roach HAROLD LLOYD film . When he says ' I DO ' at his nuptials , a young man has no idea the travail his wife's family will put him through . Harold Lloyd had another winner with this domestic comedy in which he must deal with his wife's nephews , the elder a dreadful little brat and the younger a crying baby , during a long & frightful night . As so often happened , Harold's superb athletic abilities enhance his role , even with half of his mutilated right hand hidden by a special glove . Lloyd's hilarious HOT WATER , which came three years later , doubtless drew some of its inspiration from this film . I DO originally ran longer , but when the preview audience didn't respond with enough laughs to the opening scenes Harold removed the entire first reel , tightening the picture down to a tad under 25 minutes . The animated sequence depicting the wedding is a nice touch . Mildred Davis appropriately plays Harold's wife - they would soon be married in real life . Noah Young , who acted many a tough guy in Lloyd's films , lends his menacing presence to the end of the movie . Robert Israel has composed an excellent film score which perfectly complements Harold's antics on the screen .

Here is another little film in which Donald matches wits with Huey , Dewey & Louie - a plot line which Disney had been using for the better part of two decades at this point . Even so , it's fairly entertaining , largely due to Donald's never boring personality . Clarence Nash provides the voices for the entire Duck clan .

After Pearl Harbor , Hollywood went to war totally against the Axis .

The newsreels , of course , brought the latest war news into the neighborhood theater every week . The features showcased battle stories or war related themes . Even the short subjects & cartoons were used as a quick means of spreading Allied propaganda , the boosting of morale or information dissemination .

The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work will always pay off .
437242	306861	35445	10.0	A Triumph For Three Actresses	Letitia ? TISH ' Carberry enjoys nothing more than controlling the lives & romances of all around her , aided and abetted by her two dearest friends - Lizzie Wilkins and Aggie Pilkington . The popular characters from the stories by Mary Roberts Rinehart come alive in this funny , nostalgic ( and nearly forgotten ) film . Helping immeasurably in the movie's success is the casting of a trio of Hollywood's finest comedic character actresses . Bossy & down-to-earth , Marjorie Main tackles the title role and wrestles it into submission , her ever-present Swear Box ready to accept the coins she must deposit whenever she unlooses one of her colorful , G-rated oaths . As sensible Lizzie , Aline MacMahon brings a patrician respectability to her part , although that doesn't keep her from sitting on a rowboat's leak at a crucial moment . ZaSu Pitts becomes vague , fluttery Aggie , who still writes a hilarious memorial poem on the anniversary of her sweetheart's death . Guy Kibbee is very droll as the judge whose life is made a misery by the feminine triumvirate . Among the young persons in whose lives they interfere are pretty Susan Peters & Virginia Grey . Movie mavens will recognize an uncredited Nora Cecil as one of the old ladies at the boarding house . The film benefits from MGM's typically fine production values . The story becomes unexpectedly serious near the end , but by the closing moments hilarity reigns again as Tish once more starts to meddle .
437895	306861	134935	10.0	In The Shadow Of Sugar Loaf	An MGM TRAVELTALK Short Subject . Sailing in under striking Sugar Loaf Mountain , this film introduces us to RIO DE JANEIRO , CITY OF SPLENDOUR . We visit some of the beautiful parks & gorgeous beaches , as well as view the intriguingly intricate patterned sidewalks . Finally , we are shown examples of the butterfly industry , in which tiny bits of the luminescent wings are glued together on glass to form pictures - the perfect souvenir of Rio . This is one of a large series of succinct travelogues turned out by MGM , beginning in the 1930's . They featured Technicolor views of beautiful & unusual sights around the globe , as well as vivid , concise narration . These films were produced & narrated by James A . FitzPatrick .
437533	306861	25966	10.0	Misses Oliver & Burke Spark Forgotten Screwball Comedy	A once affluent Santa Barbara family , hounded by persistent creditors , hope to rejoice ' WE'RE RICH AGAIN ' if they can marry their oldest daughter off to a very wealthy twit . Then a pretty little country cousin shows up to complicate everything . . . This sadly neglected screwball comedy from the 1930's offers manifold delights arising from its farcical plot & wonderful cast . Only a decade of over-abundant cinematic riches could afford to forget a perfectly fine film such as this . While not a great classic of its genre , such as BRING UP BABY or NOTHING SACRED , it still has much amusement to offer the lucky viewer . Edna May Oliver & Billie Burke , both unforgettable & utterly irreplaceable , are delightful as the two stars of the film . Wisecracking , polo-playing granny Oliver , frequently found in the company of her gaggle of young men , utters sardonic comments on the plot & the behavior of the other characters . Vague , fluttery Burke , perpetually in a state of mental abstraction , adds her own brand of kookiness to the story line . Olympic medalist Buster Crabbe is hilarious , spoofing himself as a champion swimmer who wears nothing but swimming trunks the entire film , even while attending a fancy garden wedding . Edgar Kennedy , as a process server unable to proceed past the driveway , gets to display his famous ' slow burn ' to great advantage . The other supporting players ( Reginald Denny , Grant Mitchell , Marian Nixon & Joan Marsh ) all ably assist with the general pandemonium .
437896	306861	31580	10.0	One More Triumph For Our Shirley	A small child , affectionately known as THE LITTLE PRINCESS , must endure great hardship after her father is killed in the Boer War . Shirley Temple had her last great box-office triumph in this splendid Technicolor adaptation of the Frances Hodgson Burnett childhood classic . No longer a tiny tot - she turned eleven the year THE LITTLE PRINCESS was released - but still a little trooper , Shirley exhibits once again the tremendous charm & talent which made her Hollywood's top box office draw . With wrinkled brow & tremulous lip or bouncing curls & joyous smile , she adeptly displays just the right mood or mannerism to keep the focus of the audience's attention firmly grasped in her chubby fists . The supporting players ' roster is abundantly well cast : stalwart Ian Hunter appears as Shirley's soldier father - this very fine actor wisely uses his acting skills to keep from being completely upstaged by the mighty moppet ; handsome Richard Greene & lovely Anita Louise play the riding master & teacher who befriend Shirley - their roles aren't terribly significant , but they fill them quite well . Mary Nash is once again cast as Shirley's tormentor , this time playing the evil-spirited headmistress of an exclusive girls ' seminary . This accomplished actress did not appear in many films , but she could generally be counted on to provide a vivid performance - notice the relish with which she essays her small part in the medieval fantasy sequence ( ' I know my rights , I know the law and what I say I saw , I saw ! ' ) . Long-legged , adenoidal Arthur Treacher plays her henpecked brother ; he is a delight during his two romps with Shirley to the music hall ditty ? Knocked ? Em In The Old Kent Road . ' Cesar Romero quietly portrays an Indian servant in a small , but important , role ; Miles Mander & E . E . Clive both appear as hardhearted , crusty old gentlemen - only one is regenerated by film's end . Sweet Beryl Mercer makes the most of her few moments as a stately , kindhearted Queen Victoria - while Eily Malyon is a true fright as the school's slatternly cook . Marcia Mae Jones participates in one of the film's most memorable moments , when , as a particularly vile teenager , she receives a face full of fireplace ashes , courtesy of sweet Shirley . Special attention should be given to ten-year-old South African Sybil Jason , who plays the wistful waifish charmaid who idolizes Shirley . In her American film debut , Warner's LITTLE BIG SHOT ( 1935 ) , she proved wonderfully winsome & winning , but the storm of attention surrounding Miss Temple ( exactly 19 months older than Miss Jason ) tends , at this remove , to swamp the boats of the other female child stars of the period . However , delightful Sybil deserves to be remembered & appreciated for her own accomplishments . The Stolen Kiss , a lavish fantasy dream sequence , provides a welcome few minutes change of pace for Temple , Nash , Louise , Greene , Treacher & Romero .
437693	306861	20902	10.0	Buster Keaton's Talkie Debut	A FREE AND EASY , hapless young man escorts Miss Gopher City , Kansas & her unspeakable mother out west to Hollywood , where they hope to make her a big time movie star . Fate , however , in the shape of a handsome movie actor , intervenes . . . With the end of the Silent Era , and Keaton no longer in control of his own career , FREE AND EASY was to be his first talking picture . While certainly not a classic , it has a certain small charm of its own and Keaton does a valiant job to provide both laughs & pathos . It is really not fair to compare Keaton's sound films with his silent masterpieces . They were two very different art forms . It is great fun to watch Buster stumble about the MGM lot , leaving chaos in his wake wherever he goes . Although there are awkward moments of staging , due largely to the restrictions of the microphone , Keaton's genius still shines through . He is given wonderful support from mammoth vaudeville veteran Trixie Friganza , as the ghastly stage mother . With her booming voice & facile face , she is able to steal scenes even from Keaton . They are hilarious together in their ' Oh King ! Oh Queen ! ' musical number . Lovely Anita Page , as Miss Gopher City , gets small chance to do anything here besides look lovely . But Robert Montgomery , as the movie actor , gets to show-off some of the charm that would very soon make him a major star . Verisimilitude is added to Keaton's chaotic adventures in Hollywood by peppering the scenes with real celebrities from the era appearing as themselves . Movie mavens should have fun spotting them : directors Cecil B . DeMille , Fred Niblo & Lionel Barrymore , as well as Jackie Coogan , Karl Dane , Dorothy Sebastian , John Miljan , Gwen Lee and 1930's top box office male , William Haines . That's Edward Brophy as the Stage Manager .
437255	306861	20888	10.0	Quick Glimpse At Depression Era Domestic Life	A VITAPHONE VARIETIES Short Subject . Living only FIVE MINUTES FROM THE STATION , a lowly clerk takes the Big Boss home for dinner . His determined wife sees this as an opportunity to campaign for her husband's promotion . Realistic & sensible , this little 3-character drama deals forthrightly with some of the pressures & dreams of an average young married couple in the early months of the Great Depression . Celebrated actress Sylvia Sidney makes one of her first screen appearances . Lynne Overman plays her husband ; and Berton Churchill as the boss presents the sort of character he would portray many times in the next ten years .
437227	306861	29682	10.0	Ghostly Encounters - - Act One	Cosmo TOPPER has his stuffy , henpecked life turned upside down by the interference of two recently deceased friends . The folks at Hal Roach Studios fashioned this popular supernatural comedy . Intended to be at the opposite extreme from the typical ghost thriller , there are no sudden chills or eerie ectoplasms here - - just lots of good humor and a few ( well done ) special effects . Owlish Roland Young plays the bemused recipient of his dead friends ' good deeds . No matter how drastically the intentions backfire , leading to arrest & scandal , Young remains a decent chap bent on regaining some equanimity in his life . ( What is most impressive about his performance are his hilarious physical contortions when under the invisible influence of the ghosts . ) Dear Billie Burke is wonderful , as usual , as Young's slightly bewildered wife , who has relinquished the role of lover to be mother hen to her husband - - hoping her control over him assures their acceptance by high society . As the Kerbys - - living and dead - - Constance Bennett & Cary Grant have plenty of star power & charm to spare and their spirits are certainly blithe , but a frank examination of their characters reveals some flaws . There is nothing funny about alcoholism or reckless driving , both of which contribute to their demise , and they are fortunate they kill only their own silly selves and not anyone else . That being said , they certainly do make a pair of great-looking spooks . The rest of the cast adds to the fun : Alan Mowbray once again plays a butler with an attitude ; young Arthur Lake appears as a hapless hotel employee ; elegant Hedda Hopper does well with her single scene as an unstuffy society doyenne ; J . Farrell MacDonald plays a no-nonsense cop ; and corpulent Eugene Pallette has fun with his role as a suspicious hotel detective . Composer Hoagy Carmichael appears as himself and Ward Bond plays a taxi driver , both uncredited . This was the first of a 3-film series and was followed by TOPPER TAKES A TRIP ( 1939 ) and TOPPER RETURNS ( 1941 ) .
437389	306861	27215	10.0	A Little Larceny Goes A Long Way	A proper Englishman & an American crook help THE WIDOW FROM MONTE CARLO retrieve her stolen love letter . Fast-moving & fun , this is another example of the comedy crime picture that Warner Brothers was so expert at producing in the 1930's . Casts & plots could be shuffled endlessly , with very predictable results , and while this assembly line approach created few classics , audience enjoyment could usually be assured . This very amusing little film - only an hour long - fits the mold perfectly ; it's slick plot quickly transporting the viewer from Monaco to Cannes , London and Margate . With a fine cast and plenty of lively humor , it's a shame that it is almost completely forgotten . Lovely Dolores Del Rio , in the title role , plays a woman straining under the constraints of nearly a year's mourning for her noble husband . She is at her most vulnerable when she is swept up by sophisticated Warren William , who sees what he likes and goes after it . The two stars , with their very different personas , work well together and give a definite sparkle to the story . For such a short film there is an unusually rich supporting cast . Louise Fazenda stirs up lots of laughs as a fiercely aggressive social climber ; as her marmalade manufacturing spouse , Herbert Mundin gives her unassuming , affable support . Together , they enjoy the movie's most hilarious scene when they attempt to follow Del Rio & William through Margate's Dreamland fun house . A fastidious Colin Clive plays Del Rio's stuffy fiancé ; Warren Hymer is very amusing as the American tough guy who takes a shine to the two lovers ; E . E . Clive , Mary Forbes & Eily Malyon glow in their tiny roles as Del Rio's overly protective aristocratic in-laws ; Olin Howland sports a British accent as a gambling butler . Movie mavens will recognize an uncredited Billy Bevan as an English constable with a black eye .
437742	306861	27188	10.0	Blondell & Farrell Are At It Again	Two lady process servers will stop at nothing to do their job - but then one falls in love with the man they are stalking . . . WE'RE IN THE MONEY was the sort of ephemeral comic frippery which the studios produced almost effortlessly during the 1930's . Well made & highly enjoyable , Depression audiences couldn't seem to get enough of these popular , funny photo dramas . Joan Blondell & Glenda Farrell are perfectly cast as the fearless , fast-talking females who will try anything to serve their subpoenas . Although Joan gets both top billing and the romantic scenes , both gals are as talented & watchable as they are gorgeous . Ross Alexander plays Blondell's love interest and he does a very nice job . Remembered now chiefly for his appearance in the classic A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM ( 1935 ) , this talented young man from Brooklyn was gifted with the good looks & acting skills which should have made him a major Hollywood star . Instead , Alexander ended up in mostly forgettable parts in obscure films . Tragically , Ross Alexander died a suicide in 1937 , at the age of only 29 . Hugh Herbert , whimsical & wacky as ever , appears as the girls ' boss . Whether driving a stolen car or piloting a speeding motorboat , he is equally hilarious . Behind him comes a rank of character actors - Henry O'Neill , E . E . Clive , Lionel Stander , Hobart Cavanaugh - all equally adept at wringing every smile out of any situation . Sharp-eyed movie mavens should spot an unbilled Walter Brennan as a witness at the wedding . While never stars of the first rank , Joan Blondell ( 1906-1979 ) & Glenda Farrell ( 1904-1971 ) enlivened scores of films at Warner Bros . throughout the 1930's , especially the eight in which they appeared together . Whether playing gold diggers or working girls , reporters or secretaries , these blonde & brassy ladies were very nearly always a match for whatever leading man was lucky enough to share equal billing alongside them . With a wisecrack or a glance , their characters showed they were ready to take on the world - and any man in it . Never as wickedly brazen as Paramount's Mae West , you always had the feeling that , tough as they were , Blondell & Farrell used their toughness to defend vulnerable hearts ready to break over the right guy . While many performances from seven decades ago can look campy or contrived today , these two lovely ladies are still spirited & sassy .

A funny little film , with some good moments watching the Rascals at play . Willie Mae Taylor portrays the part of ' Buckwheat ' .
437222	306861	34303	10.0	Ghostly Encounters - - Act Three	Cosmo TOPPER RETURNS and this time he's involved with murder ! Hal Roach Studios presents one more look at the continued supernatural adventures of Cosmo Topper . The Old Dark House routine is trotted out as our hero finds himself in a spooky cliff-top mansion replete with strange disappearances , hidden passageways and a fiendish knife-wielding killer . Roland Young & Billie Burke are back one final time as the Toppers and they remain a delight - - Mr . Young owl-like & serious in the scariest of situations and Miss Burke forever sweetly vague and befuddled . They are joined by vivacious Joan Blondell ( who actually snags top billing ) as a ghostess intent on forcing poor Topper into discovering who's just murdered her . More new costars are on hand to help liven things up : lovely Carole Landis as a rich girl in much need of protection ; Dennis O'Keefe as a taxi driver willing to provide that protection ; gaunt H . B . Warner as Miss Landis ' invalid father ; menacing George Zucco as his sinister doctor ; Rafaela Ottiano as a frightened housekeeper ; Donald MacBride as a moronic cop ; and the delightful Patsy Kelly , underused as the Toppers ' tough maid . Best of all is Eddie ' Rochester ' Anderson , ' more or less playing himself ( he even makes a gag about returning to ' Mr . Benny ' ) who rivals Miss Burke in getting the best lines in the picture . Contemporary references to Orson Welles ' radio plays and the Alfred Hitchcock movie REBECCA ( 1940 ) should amuse cognoscenti . The serious viewer must not expect to have all the mysteries solved by film's end ; indeed , most of the loose ends remain resolutely untied . Just sit back and enjoy the comedic chills served-up by this group of very fine performers . This was the third of a 3-film series , coming after TOPPER ( 1937 ) and TOPPER TAKES A TRIP ( 1939 ) .
437835	306861	20754	10.0	Charlie Ruggles Shines In Comedic Caper	Romantic complications abound when a zany young nobleman at Oxford is persuaded to impersonate his friend CHARLEY'S AUNT from Brazil - - where the nuts come from . . . Although quite an antique - with its faded print & missing moments - this ancient talkie version of the Brandon Thomas chestnut looks like what it is : a filmed version of the play , full of slapstick & mistaken identities . However , it is remarkable for containing one of the first great comedy performances of the sound cinema - Charlie Ruggles in the title role . Although at 44 he's too old to be playing a college boy , and his American accent initially seems a bit out of place , Ruggles soon dominates the proceedings with his shameless acting . Flouncing about in a granny dress , shawl & curls , flirting outrageously with two silly old men , taking pratfalls , mugging the camera , he is absolutely hilarious . Off to a good start , for the next 40 years Ruggles would be considered one of Hollywood's ablest character actors . Supporting him are some fine British stalwarts - Halliwell Hobbes , Doris Lloyd , Hugh Williams . Together with Charlie Ruggles , they make this seldom-seen film an entertaining treat for modern viewers .
437513	306861	230319	10.0	Safety Tips From Disney	A Walt Disney I'M NO FOOL Cartoon . I'M NO FOOL WITH FIRE , this strange & wonderful thing which can be my best friend or my worst enemy . This is one of a short series of little television films in which Disney helped to inform viewers about basic safety concerns and the foolish ways in which lackadaisical folks can hurt themselves . The story of man's use of fire since caveman days is discussed - as well as the consequences for not respecting its dangerous power . Jiminy Cricket , as voiced by the inimitable Cliff Edwards , is the perfect pedagogue . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor .

438289	306861	71596	10.0	Excellent Adaptation Of Oscar Wilde Fairy Tale	Standing on his column high above the great city , the statue of THE HAPPY PRINCE can see the misery & despair of the people below him . He persuades a friendly Swallow to become his messenger in valiant efforts to alleviate the suffering of the poor . This is a very fine animated version of Oscar Wilde's classic tale . The drawing is often imaginative , but never gets in the way of the story . Much of the credit for the success of this film must go to Christopher Plummer , who both narrates & gives voice to the Happy Prince ; and to Glynis Johns , who supplies exuberant life to the Swallow . Both performers are excellent . The producers , thankfully , do not shy away from the religious sentiment at the end of the story . To have done so would have robbed the film of much of its charm & authenticity . Wilde himself never shied away from piety in his writings when it could be used to good effect . Indeed , he had a great respect for Christian virtues , as long as they did not affect his private life .

But when she falls into the clutches of the villains & JUNGLE DRUMS pound out the revelry attending her imminent immolation , it begins to look like a job for Superman . . . This was another in the series of excellent cartoons initially created by Max Fleischer for Paramount Studio . They feature great animation and taut , fast-moving plots . Meant to be shown in movie theaters , they are miles ahead of their Saturday Morning counterparts . Bud Collyer is the voice of Superman ; Joan Alexander does the honors for Lois Lane .
437378	306861	27518	10.0	Three Young Stars Make Film A Success	Three little tough guys learn the value of friendship & loyalty , during family crises and troubles with the law . While overlong & predictable , THE DEVIL IS A SISSY is the only chance to see all three of MGM's little 1930's princes in one film . Freddie Bartholomew , Jackie Cooper & Mickey Rooney ( 12 , 14 and 15 respectively when the film was released ) are a great deal of fun to watch & make a terrific cinematic trio . At this point , they were all at different stages in their careers . Jackie's heyday as a child star - including a stint with Hal Roach's celebrated OUR GANG - was in the past . Freddie was in the very midst of his intense , brief major stardom . And Mickey was exhibiting glimpses of the talent that in a few years would make him the biggest star in Hollywood . Although a ? youth picture ' in every way , there are several good performances from a small crowd of adults , most notably Englishman Ian Hunter , as Freddie's sincere , honest father . Also appearing to advantage in smaller parts are Kathleen Alexander as Freddie's emotional mother ; Gene & Kathleen Lockhart as Jackie's stern parents ; and Peggy Conklin as Mickey's free-spirited aunt . Little Etienne Girardot appears as a fierce school principal , as does Jonathan Hale playing a sympathetic judge and Grant Mitchell as a serious suitor to Mickey's mom . Harold Huber , Stanley Fields & Frank Puglia are a gang of brutal thugs who run afoul of the three youngsters , while Hattie McDaniel's older sister , Etta , makes the most of her one scene as Miss Conklin's maid . That's an unbilled Dorothy Peterson doing a fine job as Mickey's mother . Movie mavens should recognize Christian Rub as a funerary stone mason ; Ian Wolfe as a pawnbroker ; and George Davis as a French diner owner - all uncredited . The good production values bestowed by MGM are also a great asset to the film , particularly in the neighborhood scenes .
438000	306861	13858	10.0	Mr . Keaton Flies High	A BUSTER KEATON Silent Short . Intrepid Buster faces danger on land , on water & in the air - generally because of his disastrous attempts to impress lovely young women . THE BALLOONATIC - which actually gives very little screen time to the hot air balloon - is rather a jumble of disjointed ( but funny ) scenes which bare scant relation to each other . With any other star it would be easy to dismiss , but Keaton holds it all together ( barely ) by the sheer force of his undeniable talent and some very amusing moments . Highlight : the trajectory of a large lady sliding precipitately out of an amusement park's horror house causes some impact problems for Buster . Born into a family of Vaudevillian acrobats , Buster Keaton ( 1895-1966 ) mastered physical comedy at a very early age . An association with Fatty Arbuckle led to a series of highly imaginative short subjects and classic , silent feature-length films - all from 1920 to 1928 . Writer , director , star & stuntman - Buster could do it all and his intuitive genius gave him almost miraculous knowledge as to the intricacies of film making and of what it took to please an audience . More akin to Fairbanks than Chaplin , Buster's films were full of splendid adventure , exciting derring-do and the most dangerous physical stunts imaginable . His theme of a little man against the world , who triumphs through bravery & ingenuity , dominates his films . Through every calamity & disaster , Buster remained the Great Stone Face , a stoic survivor in a universe gone mad . In the late 1920's Buster was betrayed by his manager / brother-in-law and his contract was sold to MGM , which proceeded to nearly destroy his career . Teamed initially with Jimmy Durante and eventually allowed small roles in mediocre comedies , Buster was for 35 years consistently given work far beneath his talent . Finally , before lung cancer took him at age 70 , he had the satisfaction of knowing that his classic films were being rediscovered . Now , well past his centenary , Buster Keaton is routinely recognized & appreciated as one of cinema's true authentic geniuses . And he knew how to make people laugh . . .
437109	306861	22635	10.0	A Change of Pace for William Haines	Although this film starts off like a typical Billy Haines comedy , it quickly becomes deadly serious . Haines plays a very unhappily married man , who finds himself with a very dead body on his hands & few plausible explanations . This gives him a chance to play a role quite different from his usual silly billys . Haines ' character is a radioman and the scenes in and around the broadcasting studio are quite well done . An unusual number of lovely ladies can be found in support in this film : Anita Page , Madge Evans , Joan Marsh & Karen Morley . Jean Hersholt is also on hand to lend his grave presence to the proceedings . ARE YOU LISTENING ? was made only two years after Haines was king of the Hollywood box office . But his days at MGM were growing short . The following year , 1933 , would be his last at the studio . Today his movies are all but forgotten .

It's Friday the 13th and the package he is to deliver by midnight is ticking ominously . . . This is a very funny little film , with poor Donald right in the thick of trouble as usual . Some older viewers will find the bicycle radio and the happy radio jingle itself to be quite nostalgic . The story was written by the legendary Carl Barks ; Clarence Nash provides Donald with his unique voice . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music .

Daisy gives a terrific performance in what would prove to be her final significant role in a Disney cartoon . Huey , Dewey & Louie play her little brothers this time around , not Donald's nephews . Careful watching of the film shows that Donald & Daisy finally met in the Japanese Tea Garden of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park . Clarence Nash provides the voice for the male Ducks , but the entries to the Diary are read with a Ronald Colman-style sophistication , a nice touch .

437996	306861	12224	10.0	Mr . Keaton's Mistaken Identity	A BUSTER KEATON Silent Short . Poor Buster becomes THE GOAT ( " scapegoat " ) for a dangerous escaped murderer . This is a wonderful , hilarious little film with Keaton at his absolute best . In what is essentially a series of chases , Buster gets to exercise his endlessly inventive imagination . Big Joe Roberts appears as the highly suspicious police chief . Born into a family of Vaudevillian acrobats , Buster Keaton ( 1895-1966 ) mastered physical comedy at a very early age . An association with Fatty Arbuckle led to a series of highly imaginative short subjects and classic , silent feature-length films - all from 1920 to 1928 . Writer , director , star & stuntman - Buster could do it all and his intuitive genius gave him almost miraculous knowledge as to the intricacies of film making and of what it took to please an audience . More akin to Fairbanks than Chaplin , Buster's films were full of splendid adventure , exciting derring-do and the most dangerous physical stunts imaginable . His theme of a little man against the world , who triumphs through bravery & ingenuity , dominates his films . Through every calamity & disaster , Buster remained the Great Stone Face , a stoic survivor in a universe gone mad . In the late 1920's Buster was betrayed by his manager / brother-in-law and his contract was sold to MGM , which proceeded to nearly destroy his career . Teamed initially with Jimmy Durante and eventually allowed small roles in mediocre comedies , Buster was for 35 years consistently given work far beneath his talent . Finally , before lung cancer took him at age 70 , he had the satisfaction of knowing that his classic films were being rediscovered . Now , well past his centenary , Buster Keaton is routinely recognized & appreciated as one of cinema's true authentic geniuses . And he knew how to make people laugh . . .
438115	306861	42567	10.0	Goofy & Humphrey	A Walt Disney GOOFY Cartoon . Foolish photographer Goofy tries to get a sleepy zoo bear to HOLD THAT POSE . . . This cartoon , full of silly fun , is quite routine in terms of story & animation . A few useful facts about photography are actually included in the story before Goofy disturbs the ursine menace . This was the first appearance by Humphrey the Bear ; his ferocity was excised for the remaining six cartoons in which he would appear . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality .

437527	306861	20686	10.0	Jail House Classic Still Rocks	THE BIG HOUSE - prison of no hope - the last terminal for lost souls . Only the strong survive ; the weak crack or are corrupted . As the warden shrewdly tells a new arrival , the place won't make you go yellow , but it you already are yellow it'll bring it out . MGM was the only studio in Hollywood which would have let a female write the script for such a strong story . But in Frances Marion they not only had the most celebrated screenwriter in the industry , but also a person uniquely qualified to write about any situation . She headed off to California's notorious San Quentin Prison to observe the conditions & learn the lingo . Cheerfully deflecting the jibes & taunts of guards & prisoners alike , she reminded them that after being a frontline correspondent in the Great War there were few situations she couldn't handle . The result is a wonderful film , tough , hard-bitten & stark . MGM did itself proud by supplying a terrific cast and production values . The scene where belligerent Wallace Beery refuses to eat the commissary slop remains a classic . Chester Morris does a fine job as a resourceful crook who is actually helped by his time in prison , reformed against his will . This excellent actor is too often ignored when the histories of 1930's cinema are written . Wallace Beery , as murderous Butch , is absolutely unforgettable . Marion wrote the part with him in mind & it is difficult to imagine anyone else playing it . Lovable & dangerous in equal measure , he steals every scene he's in . THE BIG HOUSE would set Beery firmly on the road to major talkie stardom . Robert Montgomery , on the cusp of his own salad days as a sophisticated , romantic leading man , here plays quite a different role . As a weak , cowardly stool pigeon , he's cast very much against type . It would be 1937's NIGHT MUST FALL before he received another such finely-nuanced role . Lewis Stone is very effective in the small role as the tough-as-nails warden . Beautiful Leila Hyams is well-cast as Mongomery's spunky sister . George F . Marion & DeWitt Jennings are both memorable as elderly security guards . Champion stutterer Roscoe Ates provides a few moments of much needed comic relief . Karl Dane is easily spotted as a hulking convict in several scenes , but he is curiously mute . Doubtless , his thick Danish accent was already giving the Studio trouble . Even though he had been an important comic star in silent pictures , he was quickly relegated to talkie bit parts . He was eventually further reduced to selling hot dogs from a cart outside the MGM front gates . This was the final indignity . He committed suicide in 1934 . Preview audiences were curiously cool to THE BIG HOUSE , until MGM executive Irving Thalberg figured out that female viewers didn't like con Chester Morris romancing another prisoner's wife . Thalberg instructed Marion to rewrite a few scenes and refilming made it clear that Leila Hyams was Robert Montgomery's sister , not his spouse . This pleased the patrons and the movie was a big hit .
437786	306861	16895	10.0	An Utter Delight From Mr . Lloyd	Uptown millionaire J . Harold Manners leads a life insulated by his immense wealth until he meets a very pretty young lady working with her father in a Downtown skid row mission . Comic genius Harold Lloyd had another tremendous success with FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE , a silent film very simple of plot but wildly delirious in terms of hilarious detail & inspiration . Harold had the enviable knack of making an audience like him immediately and empathize with his tribulations . They entered into and became a part of his gags , watching them build and grow , until the final explosion of laughter and the immediate start of his next comedic onslaught . Here , Harold has two of his finest sequences , two very different extended chases which illustrate his visual wizardry and perfect timing . In the first , Harold infuriates a growing crowd of enraged hoodlums , crooks and ne'er-do-wells into chasing him into the mission , so as to please the sweet young lady . In the second , which climaxes the movie , Harold races to his own delayed wedding , through crowded New York streets ( actually filmed in Los Angeles ) , while shepherding five very friendly and extremely intoxicated bums , culminating in a wild ride atop a runaway double-decker bus . Through it all , Harold exhibits his magnificent athletic ability , putting himself in real danger , a self-imposed peril made even more remarkable by the fact that he was missing half of his right hand . The production values in the film are absolutely first rate , even down to casting the ? faces , ' wistful & careworn , seen in the mission scenes . The logistics involved in filming the action sequences on actual city streets , involving crowds of extras and split-second precision timing for the stunts , is beyond merely impressive . Lloyd , who fathered the idea , put the film through five previews until he was sure he had it perfect . Jobyna Ralston once again amply fills the role of the girl of Harold's dreams . Diminutive Paul Weigel exudes saintly goodness as her father . Noah Young brings bullish bluster to his role of a tough gangster tamed by Mr . Lloyd . Robert Israel has composed an excellent film score which perfectly complements Harold's antics on the screen .
437980	306861	20691	10.0	An Epic , Trailblazing Western	A heroic young trail scout leads a large party of pioneers along THE BIG TRAIL to the West , with Indian attacks , natural disasters & romantic complications all part of the adventure . As sweeping & magnificent as its story , Raoul Walsh's THE BIG TRAIL is a wonderful film , as entertaining as it was more than seven decades ago . With very good acting and excellent production values , it lives up to its reputation as the talkies ' first epic Western . John Wayne , pulled from obscurity for his first important movie role , looks impossibly young , but he immediately impresses with the natural charm & masculine authority he brings to the hero's role ; he quietly dominates the film with the attributes which would someday make him a huge star . Marguerite Churchill is fetching as a lovely Southern belle who slowly warms to the Duke's attentions . Dialect comic El Brendel is great fun as a Swedish immigrant beset with mule & mother-in-law woes ; his appearance in a scene signals laughs for the viewer . Looking & sounding like a human grizzly bear , Tyrone Power Sr . , vast & repulsive , makes a wonderful villain . Slick cardsharp Ian Keith is a sophisticated bad guy . ( His famous physical similarity to John Gilbert is very apparent here . ) Silent movie character actor Tully Marshall is impressive as a wily old mountain man who helps guide the wagon train . Corpulent Russ Powell , as a friendly fur trapper , puts his vocal talent for making nonsense noises to good use . Sharp-eyed movie mavens will spot Ward Bond as one of the Missouri settlers . What will surprise many modern viewers is that THE BIG TRAIL was filmed in an early wide screen process , called Grandeur . More than living up to its name , the picture looks marvelous , with Walsh showing a mastery of the new technology . He fills the screen , every portion of it , with action . Notice during the crowd scenes , how everyone is busy doing real work , which adds so much to the verisimilitude of these sequences . Walsh deserves great credit for being one of the first directors to use wide screen . In addition , the film is blessedly free of the rear projection photography which blights so many older films . It should also be stressed that it is only natural that the soundtrack sounds a little primitive ; talkies were still in their cradle . That Walsh was able to use a microphone at all , with most of the scenes shot out of doors , is more kudos for him . THE BIG TRAIL was not a box office success . In 1930 , William Haines ' comedies were the big money makers and the public was looking for fare other than intelligent Westerns . Most of the cast slipped into obscurity , including Wayne . It would not be until 1939 , when John Ford rescued him in STAGECOACH , that John Wayne's legend would begin in earnest . And despite its grand & sweeping vistas , it would be another 25 years before wide screen caught on with Hollywood , largely as an answer to the economic threat from television .

Here is a typical Goofy film - lots of physical comedy and few intellectual presumptions . This was one of a small handful of cartoons to feature the Mountain Lion and probably gave him his best role . After a few roles in the shorts , Junior would return years later in the Goofy animated features as ' Max . ' Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings .

437543	306861	194340	10.0	Diving For Pearls	An MGM Short Subject . Braving great perils , Tahitian boatmen paddle their spindly SEA SPIDERS out to harvest valuable pearl oysters . This very brief documentary film takes the viewer to idyllic Tahiti and shows us a bit of the indigenous culture , with slightly ironic narration . The gathering of coconuts for copra is shown , but most of the footage deals with the pearl divers , who must fend with collapsed lungs and dangerous denizens of the deep to win their prize . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios ' feature films .
437080	306861	22685	10.0	Barrymore , Hepburn & Burke , Oh My !	A BILL OF DIVORCEMENT is only one of the problems to confront a man returning to his family after fifteen years in an insane asylum . Although this George Cukor-directed soap opera is chiefly remembered now for Katharine Hepburn's film debut , its other strengths should not be overlooked . The film was primarily crafted to be a showcase for the histrionic talents of John Barrymore and he certainly does not disappoint his audience . Charging his way through the range of emotions from giddy elation to utter despair , Barrymore , left profile firmly planted towards the camera , gives a wonderful master class in ham acting . This is in no way to disparage his performance - - he makes leaping a bit beyond the bounds terrifically entertaining . Hepburn is a sensation , of course , very fresh & unspoilt , giving real urgency to the plight of a headstrong girl who must make a wretched decision during a domestic upheaval . The viewer cannot help but think of the many decades to come in which she would continue to delight moviegoers . The trouble is that Kate's excellence makes it somewhat easy to forget the film's real female lead . In a rare serious role , Miss Billie Burke gives a splendid portrayal of a good woman torn between duty to a man she no longer loves and the possibility of joy with the man she now adores . In the scene where Barrymore forces her to make a commitment to him , Burke's body language painfully communicates the agony of her breaking heart . A fine supporting cast adds to the film's enjoyment : sensitive David Manners , one of the ablest young actors of the era , as Hepburn's loyal boyfriend ; gentlemanly Paul Cavanagh as Burke's fiancé ; waspish Elizabeth Patterson as Barrymore's strict sister ; and elderly Henry Stephenson as the wise family doctor . Movie mavens will have to look fast to spot the excellent young English actor , Bramwell Fletcher , unbilled as the fellow at the Christmas party who opens the windows for the carolers .

The bullfighter then proceeds to proudly show-off his skills in the bullring . An interesting & somewhat violent little black & white cartoon , with a great many of Disney's obligatory posterior gags . Most of the music , appropriately , is from Bizet's Carmen . The surprisingly gynandrous bull could almost be seen as a precursor of the celebrated Ferdinand . The SILLY SYMPHONIES , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most fascinating of all animated series . Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount , with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music . There was little plot in the early Symphonies , which featured lively inanimate objects and anthropomorphic plants & animals , all moving frantically to the soundtrack . Gradually , however , the Symphonies became the school where Walt's animators learned to work with color and began to experiment with plot , characterization & photographic special effects . The pages of Fable & Fairy Tale , Myth & Mother Goose were all mined to provide story lines and even Hollywood's musicals & celebrities were effectively spoofed . It was from this rich soil that Disney's feature-length animation was to spring . In 1939 , with SNOW WHITE successfully behind him and PINOCCHIO & FANTASIA on the near horizon , Walt phased out the SILLY SYMPHONIES ; they had run their course & served their purpose .

This was one of a short series of cartoons that featured the little feline from PINOCCHIO ( 1940 ) . There's plenty of good humor here , with the mangy villain getting exactly what he deserves .

Trouble is , the pint-sized pachyderm is beset by bullies who ridicule his trunk and make his life miserable . Then a conflagration breaks out at Tillie's tree house . . . A very cute little film , very nicely drawn , with a sound moral message . It could have been the start of a series of Elmer Elephant shorts , but , alas , that was not to be and Elmer & his friends went into almost immediate cartoon oblivion . The pelicans , for those too young to know , are spoofs of Jimmy Durante . The SILLY SYMPHONIES , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most interesting of series in the field of animation . Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount , with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music . There was little plot in the early Symphonies , which featured lively inanimate objects and anthropomorphic plants & animals , all moving frantically to the soundtrack . Gradually , however , the Symphonies became the school where Walt's animators learned to work with color and began to experiment with plot , characterization & photographic special effects . The pages of Fable & Fairy Tale , Myth & Mother Goose were all mined to provide story lines and even Hollywood's musicals & celebrities were effectively spoofed . It was from this rich soil that Disney's feature-length animation was to spring . In 1939 , with SNOW WHITE successfully behind him and PINOCCHIO & FANTASIA on the near horizon , Walt phased out the SILLY SYMPHONIES ; they had run their course & served their purpose .
