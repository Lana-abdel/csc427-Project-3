417556	663392	295254	1.0	Thought It Was Going to Be Better than This	Thought this just might be a great picture concerning a mystery murder involved with the Internet and was sadly disappointed as the film progressed to go down hill . Stephen Dorff , ( Detective Mike Reilly ) , " Alone in the Park " , was finally convinced that what he thought was the death of many young girls was a illness spreading throughout New York City . However , Natascha McElhone , ( Terry Hudson ) , who played the role as Board of Health specialist told Mike Reilly that she believed all these young girls where killed because of a website they visited . This film goes into a complete spin out of control and never stops until the very end . Don't waste your time viewing this film , no matter how cheap it sells for in the stores .
417324	663392	56875	1.0	Great Halloween Film	This picture showed nice looking gals which did brighten up this so called story about Egyptian rituals and a caterer who enjoyed his meat prepared on the raw side of things . There is a serial killer on the loose who does horrible things to all the females he captures and you will have to see the film because the scenes are too graphic to describe , except that it is real gore and blood all over the place . The worst thing about this film is the poor acting by all the actors and the fake hair or powder to make a person look old . This is a film you will enjoy seeing on Halloween night and you are trying to get all spooked up about old Egyptian customs and what happens to poor young virgins . Sick film
416206	663392	102187	1.0	Entertaining Film	This was a great martial arts film starring John Travis , ( Ronald L . Marchini ) who finds himself living in the world as the last cop on earth . John has a hat that reads : " Special Cop " who runs into all kinds of horrible looking men and women who want to kill the last cop on earth . John Travis meets up with a woman named Rachel , ( Carrie Chambers ) who is badly beaten up , Rachel tries to protect all the children in the various surrounding cities and they call them Free-Bees and she offers them a nice shelter to live in . Rachel is also a scientist who has knowledge of Teleportation which can transport people from one area in the country to another , something like a time machine . However , Rachel has a broken crystal which enables her to transport human beings into other places . Rachel asks John Travis to assist her in obtaining this crystal which she tells John he should have no problems in trying to secure this new crystal , which turns out to be very false statement to John . There is plenty of action in the B film with horrible acting , but lots of fun to just watch and enjoy .
417129	663392	209020	1.0	Dying Production	Decided to tape a film from TV which was scheduled for around 1AM and soon found out why it was hidden away in the wee hours of the AM . Always liked John Heard as an actor and he did a great job trying to hold this film together along with actors who just did not measure up as supporting actors . Most of the film showed John Heard drinking beer . throwing a beer bottle against the wall of his apartment and blowing smoke rings . There was constant flash backs of his young daughter running into the street after a ball she was playing with and his wife who was pregnant . I must say this film was not worth watching , it actually put me to sleep , causing me to rewind the tape to find out what finally happened at the end . This is a real SLEEPER of a FILM .
418015	663392	289616	1.0	Worst Film I Have Ever Seen	This film kept my interest for a very brief period of my time and then I started to find myself becoming very detached from everything that was going on in this film . There was some drama and mostly comedy and my interest soon faded away and I could hardly wait until the film ended . I felt like I had been watching a pure messed up film with all kinds of messed up people creating a film that made very little sense . I applaud the poor actors who had to act in this film and keep it going , especially Patrick Muldoon , Paul Sampson and of course , the charming Carmen Electra who carried the entire picture on her back . Please don't waste your time like I did .
416180	663392	218619	1.0	People Alive & Dead	This film concerns a very young girl , Cassie , ( Melissa Sagemiller ) who leaves her family and heads off to become a college freshman . One night Cassie and her friends decide to go to a wild party with plenty of drinking and dancing and Cassie is riding with her boyfriend who she likes but never told him she loved him . As Cassie was driving , a car was stopped in the middle of the road and she was unable to avoid an accident and as a result there is a bloody loss of lives along with her boyfriend . Cassie becomes very emotionally upset and has nightmares which cause her to have hallucinations about her boyfriend coming back to life and encounters men trying to murder her and she is struggling to find out who her real friends are , who wants her dead and will she survive this entire horror ordeal . Cassie dreams she is being made love to by her boyfriend after he died and finds another guy in her bed and is told she was asking him to make love . This is a way out film , and not very good at all .
417569	663392	451998	1.0	NY Is the Tropics & Miami is the Arctic	If you have nothing else to do and want some quick stupid entertainment , this is the film to watch . All the actors gave an outstanding performance , however , the special effects was done on a very low budget and since it really was a TV program , you cannot expect very much from this production . The story is about a company called INTER SCI and a group of Climatologist , Jeff Fahey , ( David Koch ) , Erika Eleniak , ( Bryn ) and Jessica Amlee , ( Sophie ) who have reason to believe there is immediate danger from a shift in the Earth's polarity which triggered the last ICE AGE . In other words , Miami , Florida will be completely covered in ice and snow like Anartica and the first warning was a huge ICE BERG floating in the waters surrounding Miami . Erika Eleniak , ( Bryn ) was not a Climatologist , but a girl David Koch fell in love with years ago and then up and left her . Bryn lost her husband in this Arctic storm and it rekindled an old romance .
417896	663392	79758	1.0	HORRIBLE FILM about a HORRIBLE NOTHING ! !	It is not very often that I can actually say that a suppose to be Horror Film was HORRIBLE and the " Prophecy " hit the bottom on my scale ! I have to give the actors credit for trying to carry this film on their backs . Robert Foxworth ( Dr . Robert Verne ) , " Invisible Strangler " , ' 76 , who decided to leave Bronx , NY for a nice low key job in the woods of Maine ! Talia Shire ( Maggie Verne ) gave a good supporting role , taking care of a monster like baby and just blaming her husband for everything that went wrong ! Armand Assante ( John Hawks ) , " Hunt for the Devil " , ' 03 tried to make the film interesting , but his role in this film was just plain HORRIBLE . Skip this film , you are not missing anything !
416487	663392	66893	1.0	Lots of Laughs	Purchased a DVD with three ( 3 ) films and this film was one of them , so I decided to see just what this film was all about . Earle Edgerton , ( Tom ) , Judith Resnick ( Laura ) and Martin Barlorski ( Dan ) all made just this film or maybe two after this production . The star of the film was Burt Young , ( Gimpy ) , " Nicky's Game " , ' 05 who is a great character actor and is presently making great films . The background has scenes from Coney Island , Brookly , N . Y . and even Nathan's Hot Dog Stand is shown with Gloria Spivak , ( Dumpy Gal ) who made only this one picture and faded out from stardom . All I can really say it was a Big Joke to watch , horrible horror film and it made absolutely no sense at all . Oh , I forgot to say if you like lots of Teddy Bears to hug , there are plenty in this picture .
417403	663392	110178	1.0	Entertaining Film	This film is about a 17 year old named Kyle Bradley , ( Renee Humphrey ) who goes to the big city to find her half sister Merci who is a singer and she has the police after her for getting involved in a murder . Kyle being a very young girl runs into all kinds of creeps who want to rape her and turn her in on the sex slave market . However , Kyle meets up with Sergeant Lee Teffler , ( C Thomas Howell ) who befriends her and gives her a place to live at his own pad . Sgt . Lee finds out he is also looking for Merci and the plot thickens and Lee gets himself involved with a bunch of hoods who are cold blooded and love to kill and torture . Sgt . Lee begins to fall in love with 17 year old Kyle and her age stops him from wanting to make love to her which causes many problems between the two of them . Entertaining film . Enjoy .
417561	663392	152174	4.0	Molly Ringwald Helped This Film	Always enjoyed the acting of Molly Ringwald , so I decided to watch this film on TV and found it very mysterious with Molly Ringwald , ( Anne Winslow ) , " In The Weeds " playing the role of a Classical Music DJ . The film reminded me of the Clint Eastwood Film , " Play Misty " , however , this story had a different twist that involved young women who were being murdered by drinking a glass of wine . Christopher Heyerdahl , ( Detective Lou Heinz ) comes to the aid of Anne Winslow and begins to start falling in love with her and introduces her to his favorite music and night clubs . There are many creepy characters who work with Anne at her Radio Station and the station begins to get full of roses which the killer keeps sending to Anne . If it were not for Molly Ringwald playing in this film , I would never have watch it . Try to Enjoy
416351	663392	117894	5.0	Keep Your Eye on the Road	Enjoyed viewing this Stephen King tale from his State of Maine and the great scenery in Maine with its great Victorian homes and small towns . Robert John Burke , ( Billy Halleck ) is a man who loves to eat food constantly and hit the scale of 300 lbs . and his wife , Lucinda Jenney , ( Heidi Halleck ) is after Billy to cut down and go on a diet . Heidi is a very petite pretty woman who looks like an ant next to poor Billy . Bill Halleck defends a big mobster named Richie Ginelli , ( Joe Mantegna ) and Joe is very grateful to Billy and after the trial tells Billy he owns him a big favor . Billy and Heidi are driving home from a party and Heidi decides to go down on Billy while he is driving and he kills a gypsy woman and from that point on in the film everything gets quite interesting . There is plenty of blood and gore and even strawberry pie is brought into the picture and some kind of a gypsy curse is placed on Bill Halleck . Even Stephen King appears in this picture as a drug store pharmacist who has a great deal of trouble trying to see people with his very thick lenses .
417297	663392	331468	5.0	Old House / Old Story	Enjoy the great acting of Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone , and in this film , I just about figured out how this story would begin and end , just like most other films with an Old House and what generally happens to the people living in the rooms . Sharon plays ( Leah Tilson ) , who is very happy working in NYC and is flying in a airplane with her boss and she gets hit on , but something happens to her son and the entire scene changes to house hunting in a very remote area where they are looking for a home to purchase . Dennis Quiad , ( Cooper Stilson ) decided to purchase the home and their son and daughter simply love the place , there are all kinds of items left behind by the former owners in this old sort of haunted looking house . There is a bad dude that visits the home and fixes the Stilson's outdoor pool and his girl friend is a sexy number he likes to love and punch around the pool hall , mostly on Saturday nights . You can just about expect the usual thing that eventually happens in films that start off this way , so watch it if you want , it is really not that BAD !
417189	663392	90130	5.0	Much To Do About Nothing	Missed seeing this film over the years as I am a big fan of Gene Hackman , ( Walter Llyod / Duke Potter ) , " Absolute Power " , who plays the role as the average husband and wife with a son who is not very close to his father at all . Matt Dillon , ( Chris Llyod / Derek Potter ) , " Loverboy " , plays the son and Gayle Hunnicutt ( Donna Llyod ) " Dream Lover " , is the wife who tries her very best to get her Walter to become closer to their son Chris . Donna disappears while she is on a tour in a foreign country and then the story gets quite complicated with lots of guns going off and plenty of car chases and great photograph in Germany and France . This film builds you up as you start getting interested and sort of goes down hill real fast . I like Gene Hackman and that is the only reason I decided to finish seeing this film .
416677	663392	269376	5.0	Husband neglects Wife	This story is about a sort of attractive middle age wife with some middle age problems around the waist , who is being neglected by her husband in the sex department . This gal is Oliva Hussey , ( Catherine Gaits ) , " Headspace " , ' 05 , who is married to a very busy wealthy guy who just simply falls asleep as soon as he gets into bed . One day her husband decides to purchase a yacht and sends his wife off to settle the sale of the vessel . Catherine meets up with a young man , John Denison , ( Peter Thornton ) , " Karla " , ' 06 and Peter notices that she looks very much like his wife and he becomes very interested in her and they have a drink together . It is from this point on that things begin to go crazy and the picture speeds into action and the drama begins . Very good film for a TV Show , but sort of a copy-cat story we have seen many times before .
417819	663392	59694	5.0	Strange Film	This picture deals with three different women and one especially who has a husband who has always loved to study spiders and ants and this couple live in this very huge home with so many rooms you could really get lost inside and the basement is the same way . This woman kills a man and she calls in Scotland Yard and they investigate the crime and then one of the inspectors finds out that there are large spiders roaming around and actually running after them . These spiders are big as large dogs and their lives are threatened , the woman convinces the inspectors that her husband committed this murder and he is taken away to prison . The fact is that this woman actually kept these spiders and helped them grow into huge insects . Remember , there are really two more women in this picture who have another strange story to tell .
417724	663392	303933	6.0	Outstanding Marching Band Film	If you like College Marching Bands , the formations on the football field , all the band instruments from the Piccolo right up to the Bass Tuba , this is the film to enjoy . The film features some dudes who come from all walks of life and one dude enters this drum program with a scholarship and thinks he can do just as he darn pleases in this program . The dude is a good drummer , but he just can't seem to follow orders , because the band program is run like a Boot Camp , with Yes Sir and No Sir type of situations . There is drama , comedy and plenty of sexy wild music and very hot cheerleader chicks . This film gives you what the background is like with a drum team competing with other college bands . Enjoy .
417786	663392	382628	6.0	Roosevelt Island Nightmare Story	The location of this film is in Manhattan and also Roosevelt Island and the story revolves around a divorced couple , Dahlia Williams , ( Jennifer Connelly ) and her husband who lives in Jersey City , N . J . They have a daughter named Cecilia Williams , ( Ariel Gade ) and there is a custody dispute between this couple and most of their troubles start when Dahlia moves to Roosevelt Island which can only be reached by a tram cable car from Manhattan .

This is a very creepy film with horrible living conditions and lots of crazy spirits wandering all around . Enjoy .
416446	663392	39266	6.0	Great Christmas Film from 1947	Enjoyed seeing this film which has a Christmas theme and concerns three adopted men who have gone in different places in the world after being adopted by their Aunt Matilda Reed , ( Ann Harding ) . George Raft , ( Mario Torio ) had a background of serving time in prison and escaping into a foreign county . The second adopted son is George Brent , ( Michael Brooks ) who is a con-artist and the third son is Randolph Scott , ( Johnny ) who is an alcoholic and is a sort of burned out cowboy from the West . Their Aunt Matilda wants to locate these adopted sons and have them at her house on Christmas eve . The reason she wants to bring the family together is she is fearful her nephew is trying to cheat her out of her fortune , as she is very rich . This story goes into great detail about each of her sons which is very interesting with plenty of comedy , drama and even three babies get involved . Cute Film .
416945	663392	56940	6.0	Classic Film Comedy	If you like Frank Sinatra and remember some of these old time actors , and some very talented ones , this would be a good film for you to watch and enjoy . The story evolves around a New York Jewish Family who all try to create some nice Jewish accents , except Frank Sinatra , who does not even make the attempt . Lee J . Cobb , ( Harry Baker ) , is the father to Alan Baker , ( Sinatra ) and calls his son a BUM and a do nothing Playboy , ( which he really is in this film ) Molly Picon , ( Sophie ) , is the mother to the Baker family and gets upset with having to answer the many telephone calls she has to answer in her son's apartment . Barbara Rush ( Connie ) is very attractive and has a great romantic interest in Alan Baker along with many other hot chicks . Even Dan Blocker , ( Eckman ) " Gunsmoke " TV Series , finds time to give Alan Baker a right upper hook to the jaw . Nice 1963 film with even Frank Sinatra singing a few musical tunes I did not recognize .
417314	663392	74452	6.0	Cast of Great Actors	The German's had a plan in 1940 to fly in sixteen paratroopers into England in a remote little town and Liam Devlin , ( Donald Sutherland ) was sent in ahead to pretend he was the marsh inspector and he made sure things fit into place . Liam also set himself up with a very young pretty English gal who he falls in love with . Col . Kurt Steiner , ( Michael Caine ) plays the role as commander of the German army which is planning to capture a very well known English Prime Minister . This film shows very clear details on the German side and the British and many high German officials are portrayed by many great veteran actors . The photography is outstanding and old war planes give the film a great deal of realism . Enjoy .
416508	663392	435653	6.0	Don't Dance on Graves Ever	This is a very exciting Horror , Thriller film which deals with a group of friends named Harris McKay , ( Dominic Purcell ) and Allison Mitchell , ( Clare Kramer ) . These people attend the funeral of a very close friend and then return to the cemetery in the evening after they have all had plenty of drinks and then they all decided to dance on all the graves and think nothing about it . However , all these people never realized who was in these graves they danced on and their backgrounds . It is not too long before all the people who danced on graves find that their lives are being bothered by unexplainable happening in their lives and their homes are being haunted . There is an expert that investigates the spirit world and is able to tell them they are being attacked by people who are killers and even a woman who is an ax murder . Don't miss this film , it has lots of thrills and chills and will keep you spellbound . Enjoy .
417361	663392	299854	6.0	Great Story	This story deals with a very happy guy named Denis Hopkins , ( Jonny Lee Miller ) who is a pilot and he has a wife he loves very much and she is pregnant and they are both looking forward to their son or daughter . Denis likes to bring his airplane to great heights and then turn the engine off and lets the plane descend and at the last minute he would turn the plane back on and scare his wife and sister-in-law in order to show he had great skill as a pilot . There is a terrible crime committed in the home of Denis and his wife which changes the direction of this film and Denis goes from one prison to another in order to get justice and revenge for a great harm which came to him and caused him to have a mental breakdown . Andy Serkis , ( Ricky Barnes ) gave an outstanding acting performance which created a great resentment towards his horrible character . Enjoy .
416020	663392	117777	6.0	Turturro Gave a Great Performance	Remember when the McGuire Sisters were at the top of their careers and everyone was dreamy eyed at the fact they had wonderful voices on the Ed Sullivan TV Show and also their father was a Preacher . When the facts finally came out about Phyllis McGuire getting involved with a top notch gangster from Las Vegas , WOW it was the Shock of the Century in those days . John Turturro , ( Sam Giancana ) , " She Hate Me " , ' 04 , played the role of Sam to perfection and when he met Phyllis McGuire's parents , he made a complete Ass of himself and it was quite funny . Mary-Louise Parker , ( Phyllis McGuire ) , " Romance & Cigarettes " , ' 05 , gave a great supporting role and had some real funny scenes in a motel room with their sleeping arrangements and final love making . It sure is a nice entertaining film if you happened to miss seeing it .
416953	663392	94602	6.0	Stone behaved in this Film	Enjoyed viewing this film as a great many of the scenes were shot on location in the City of Chicago and I recognized some of the neighborhoods . Steven Seagal , ( Nico Toscani ) , shows off his great talents in this film and of course he was slim and trim and full of action through out the entire picture . There was lots of action scenes with a car in a high rise parking lot almost falling into the street below . Subway rides around the loop and South Side car chases and plenty of beatings and needles being stuck in arms . Pam Grier ( Delores Jackson ) , gave a great supporting role as Nico's partner on the police force . Sharon Stone , ( Sara Toscani ) , Nico's wife and mother of his child , played a sweet and loving mother and wife and you would hardly recognize her this picture . Seagal did an outstanding performance and is truly a great actor .
417200	663392	44828	6.0	Great Broderick Crawford Film	If you like Broderick Crawford , you will enjoy this film from beginning to end . Broderick plays the role of Sgt . Matt Trainor who leads a group of people from Arizona with all kinds of backgrounds , one man was a gun smuggler for the Indians , Black Cloud and a young woman , named Julia Lanning , ( Barbara Hale ) who is among many men but no one tries to hit on her , mainly because they are too busy fighting off Indians constantly . There is plenty of action with arrows flying through the air and people running out of water and Sgt . Matt playing all kinds of games with the Native American Indians who do not fool around and drive a hard bargain . Lloyd Bridges , " Sea Hunt TV Series " ( Jim Starbuck ) looks very young and gives a great supporting role . Enjoyable 1953 film classic which was filmed in Buttercup Dunes , California and not the Sahara Desert .
417559	663392	86859	6.0	The Musical Score was Fantastic	Missed this movie over the years , however , I did like the popular song from this film and so I decided to watch this film after all these years . Richard Widmark , ( Ben Caxton ) , " Coma " plays the role of a business man who has many dark secrets that no one knows and pulls the strings on crime and corruption . Rachel Ward , ( Jessie Wyler ) , " The Ascent " gives an outstanding performance along with some torrid sex scenes . Jeff Bridges , ( Terry Brogan ) , " The Moguls " , is an athlete who was injured and still desires to build himself back up again , however he is down on his luck . Terry meets up with James Woods , ( Jake Wise ) " Be Cool " , who runs a Nite Club and has connections and offers Terry an opportunity to repay a debt which is rather risky . There are encounters with some very rough characters and even dogs who are both out for blood . Like I said before , the music was great .
416148	663392	110516	6.0	Lots of Comedy & Fun	Melanie Griffith , ( V ) played a woman of the streets who meets up with three boys who want to see what a girl looks like in the nude . Of course , if they really wanted to do it the correct way , they could ask their dad's and possibly their mothers . However , this is a Hollywood film and it made the entire story quite funny , especially when they have a sex education class and decided to use a rather non-kosher way of presenting the facts . Ed Harris , ( Tom Wheeler ) plays the father to Michael Patrick Carter , ( Frank Wheeler ) who gets to be good friends with Melanie Griffith and introduces her to his father . This is a very entertaining film and you can find fault with this film whether you are on the left or right side in life , but comedy and laughs are good for everyone and I recommend this film for great viewing .
417143	663392	59678	6.0	Mass Destruction	This is a good Sci-Fi Thriller about a secret laboratory that is studying Biochemical Weapons Research out in a remote desert area of Arizona . This secret plant is invaded by people who want to obtain this certain chemical which is called the " Satan Bug " in order to have complete control over the entire world which can cause complete destruction of the entire world . George Maharis , ( Lee Barrett ) sets out to find out who has been able to break into their labs along with Dana Andrews , ( General Williams ) who also has a daughter Ann Williams , ( Anne Francis ) who gets into the middle of this story about germ warfare . Edward Asner , ( Veretti ) plays one of the bad guys in this film and gives a great supporting role . This film was a head of its times and it fits in greatly with the year 2007 and all the talk about Weapons of Mass Destruction .
416631	663392	24727	6.0	Enjoyable 1933 Classic Film	These old time films in black and white hold my interest and especially great actors like Lionel Atwell , ( Dr . Otto Von Niemann ) along with Fay Wray , ( Ruth Bertin ) and Melvyn Douglas , ( Karl Brellschneider ) . The local town people are experiences strange deaths in their town where the people all have their blood drained from their bodies and there are two small puncture wounds on their necks . Rumors's start to spread that they are caused by bats and some people think it is a vampire which is attacking all the people . Karl is the local policeman in the area and he sets out to try and solve just what is going on and he seeks the help from a local town doctor named Dr . Otto Von Niemann who thinks it could possibly be a local man who seems to love bats and keeps them as pets and he also keeps them in his home and in his coat . This is a great classic film with some comedy mixed in with all this blood sucking .
417862	663392	36653	6.0	John Carradine was Outstanding	Always enjoyed the films of John Carradine and in this film you will see his great acting abilities as a painter who loves to paint beautiful women and gets a thrill out of killing them . John playing the role of Bluebeard is a natural to him with all his expressions and eyes that seem to glow like moons . The law is constantly trying to find this killer and they keep going around in circles . Bluebead meets up with a very attractive girl named Lucille , ( Jean Parker ) who seems to make him change his ways and he actually falls in love with her and she has no idea just what type of man he is , except that he paints a good picture . This is a great John Carradine Classic which is worth watching after his many horror films over the years of his career .
417789	663392	52655	7.0	Roger Corman B Film	Enjoyed this black & white comedy , horror thriller about a busboy who works in a café where artists and hippies frequent . Walter Paisley , ( Dick Miller ) is the busboy who is really untalented in every way who listens to all the artist talking about their talents and poetry is recited all the time . One night Walter goes home and hears a cat howling behind the walls of his apartment and decides to cut a hole in the wall and free the cat . However , he kills the cat with a knife and realizes this is the landlord's cat and decides to make the cat into a clay figure with a knife in the side of it . Waltere gets all excited when a girl named Carla , ( Barboura Morris ) kisses him for his great work on a nude model and he falls in love . This is a funny film and would be okay for a Halloween Night viewing .
417778	663392	61385	7.0	Enjoyable Comedy	Enjoyed the great acting by the entire cast in this very enjoyable comedy about two newly weds who are living in New York City and the film starts with this couple riding in a horse and carriage through Central Park where they are staying at the Plaza Hotel . Paul Pratter , ( Robert Redford ) plays the husband who is a lawyer and his bride is Corie Pratter , ( Jane Fonda ) who stay six days at the hotel and then they both go to their apartment which is on the fifth floor and there is no elevator in this rather old brownstone building . Charles Boyer , ( Victor Velasco ) gives a great supporting role as an older man who has been married four times and becomes friends with Corie Pratter . Mildred Natwick , ( Ethel Banks ) who plays the role as the mother to Cori and she gets involved with Victor Velasco in a romantic relationship . Neil Simon produced a great film and I could watch it over and over again .
418006	663392	17739	7.0	Very Entertaining Silent Film	Enjoyed this film from the very beginning to the very end and loved the great acting of all the actors along with plenty of laughs . This was a rather spooky film with secret panels , hands with long pointed fingers grasping at your neck and people running around in an old mansion . In this film various people have been summoned to this haunted house by a lawyer who is going to read the Last Will & Testament of a rich Cyrus West who wanted his will read twenty years after his death . Cyrus West knew that his relatives were like Cats and a Canary looking for him to die in order to obtain his great wealth . Laura La Plante , ( Annabelle West ) and Creighton Hale , ( Paul Jones ) gave great performances , don't miss this great film Classic from 1927 .
417732	663392	43625	7.0	Star's SWAN SONG	Always enjoyed the great acting of John Garfield , ( Nick Robey ) and for some reason , I did not see this picture until just recently on TCM . The film is hard to locate nowadays and was great to see the very last picture that John Garfield ever made . As usual , Nick Robey is a down on his luck guy in this picture and even his own mother hates his guts and gives him a very hard slap in the face . Nick gets involved with a robbery and decides at the same time to go for a swim in the local indoor swimming pool and meets up with Shelly Winters , ( Peggy Dobbs ) . These two get pretty close to each other and Peggy sort of invites Nick into her parents apartment and it is from that point in the film when everything starts to get interesting . John Garfield's career was beginning to slow down for him in Hollywood and he did have heart problems and was found dead making love , which was probably exactly the way Garfield would have want it to happen in real life . Great Classic film with a very sad ending .
417187	663392	264472	7.0	A Simple Accident on the FDR	Enjoyed the great acting of Ben Affleck , ( Gavin Banek ) along with an outstanding performance by Samuel L . Jackson , ( Doyle Gipson ) who are total strangers until they both have an accident on the FDR in New York City . Gavin Banek is a financial lawyer who works for his father-in-law who owns the firm and is being groomed for bigger and better things in this law firm . Doyle Gipson is recovering from substance abuse and is very happy about being able to purchase a new home and also the fact he will be able to go before a judge and show how great his rehabilitation is working out for him , so he can have the custody of his two children . This accident causes problems for both of these men and the entire story deals with how these two men are able to face some very difficult lessons to be learned by both of them .

Taped this film years ago and thought it was just a great film about three ( 3 ) young gals striving to make a career in the dance field . It showed the hard work behind the scenes of the dancing world and gives encouragement for all those trying to follow in their footsteps . The location in Canada is depressing and the abandoned warehouse they decided to rent was unbelievable . There is lots of love and HOT romance along with a cute scene with a little boy asking a question about " Orgie's " and a very cute reply from his mother .

416099	663392	315733	8.0	Great Masterpiece of Work	Enjoyed viewing this film from the very beginning of the film to the end . Many of the actors gave outstanding performances in their roles and Sean Penn , ( Paul Rivers ) and Naomi Watts , ( Christina Peck ) were super stars in this story . There are many quick flashbacks , from one person to another and the director leaves the audience to solve the problems each man and woman is facing and some of the characters have deep dark secrets , with heart transplants and an ex-con who tries to find a more spiritual way of life and convert the towns he visits .

417047	663392	48393	8.0	Great Classic Film with Great Veteran Actors	Always enjoy Orson Welles screen writing and film direction and all the great films he produced in black and white , I remember one film he did in color and it was a flop . In this film , Orson Welles , ( Gregory Arkadin ) , " Butterfly " , ' 82 , plays a very rich mysterious man who has problems trying to remember the past and is extremely devoted to his daughter . Akim Tamiroff , ( Jakob Zouk ) , " The Great Bank RObbery , " , ' 69 plays a very comical role and has a very great desire to have GOOSE LIVER with gravy and all the trimmings and somehow manages to get his request . Patricia Medina , ( Mily ) , " Count Your Blessings " , ' 59 , is a very hot sexy gal who gets deeply involved with Gregory Arkadin and gets a very hard time of the affair .

If you like Orson Welles and missed this film , you will greatly enjoy this very mysterious film .
417098	663392	56406	10.0	GREAT CLASSIC BOXING CHAMPS IN THIS FILM !	Anthony Quinn , Jackie Gleason and Mickey Rooney made this film a great black and white film classic for all future generations . However , as a young boy living in Richmond Hill , Queens during the 1940's , I had Abe Simon ( great prize fighter , who fought Joe Lewis ) a neighbor who lived down the street . Abe Simon was an adviser for this film along with Willie Pep ( World Featherweight boxing Champion 1942-48 / 1949-50 ) Abe Simon looked like a giant and had huge hands , but was a very kind and down to earth person and well liked . Willie was also an adviser in this film for Anthony Quinn and later became a bouncer in NYC . These great boxer's gave this film the great realism that it has and it was great to see them along with another great boxer , Jack Dempsey , who owned a food establishment on Broadway NYC . This film clearly shows the horrible results of boxing in the ring for a profession , however , all boxers and future boxers should be praised for their great gifts in that field of endeavor .
416075	663392	13085	10.0	CLARA BOW CAPTURED THIS ENTIRE SILENT FILM ! !	Clara Bow , the " IT " GIRL of Hollywood , who was exploited by her directors and under-paid for all her roles , showed her great talent in this film . Clara Bow played " Dot " Morgan , daughter to Patience Morgan ( Marguerite Courtat ) " Silas Marner " ' 22 and Raymond McKee ( Thomas Allan Dexter ) " Uncle Tom " 1929 . If you have never seen a silent screen film with a great actress of all time , view this film and enjoy the great talents of Clara Bow who was given low budget films and never complained , she just wanted to perform from her very heart ( Even her own mother tried to Kill Her ) and soul and that is all that matter to this great Classic Film Star , who will be remembered forever and ever !
417729	663392	35157	10.0	Jitterbug / Swing Dancing	This film will bring you way back to the Big Band era and the entire picture is filled with outstanding actors , great musicians and dancers . Glenn Miller , ( Gene Morrison ) played the role of Gene and had to put up with all the band wives and their secret affairs between each other . One of the real trouble makers was Carole Landis , ( Natalie Mercer ) , " I Wake Up Screaming " , who was a big gossip and acted like a big Cat with large claws . Natalie wore outrageous hats with all kinds of flowers on top and did her very best to break up some newly weds who just got married . There was plenty of old time tunes and plenty of jitterbug , or what we call today , SWING DANCING . There are two African American dancers who gave an outstanding performance almost towards the end of film that was very entertaining . Jackie Gleason was a string bass player in the Gene Morrison ( Glen Miller Band ) and said quite a few lines . This is a great Classic Musical Film with all time great jazz players . Enjoy
416473	663392	167146	10.0	Your MOM & DAD are Your Best Friends In The Entire World !	It is very easy to pick this film a part , and it is probably very easy to say that I would never get trapped like Jordan Ladd , ( Martha Hoagland ) , " Puzzled " , 01 , into an Internet Chat room or my daughter or son would never be that stupid to be lead away from our home by total strangers . If the mom in this picture , Cheryl Ladd , ( Connie Hoagland ) , " Lisa " , ' 90 , had noticed the signs of withdrawal by her daughter when she practically lived in the bedroom and gave complete devotion to the Computer , Jordan would never have faced the problems she faced . She was seeking Love in all the wrong places and the break up with her boyfriend sent her over the edge . This film is reminding us there is always someone in the Internet Chat Rooms who are playing very horrible games and pretending to be someone they really are not . This film pointed out the fact that Mom & Dad's are our best friends , and should be trusted enough to tell our most deepest SECRETS ! Remember , our parents were all very young ONCE , and can really help you with your deepest , darkest PROBLEMS ! Let Them HELP !
417890	663392	290673	10.0	Excellent Film	This film is everything I had hoped it would be and even more so in many ways . If you want to see a film that portrays men's and women's feelings about life and sex , both straight and gay , this is a film that will enlighten you to what goes on in the minds of men and woman . You will experience titles of the film backwards , gay men enjoying themselves and also hookers having a wonderful time as well as a poor young gal getting raped in horrible graphic details , also a man's face being busted into pieces of blood and gore . There is also a scene about a he / she gal who shows her / his private parts . If all these things interest you or you are curious about what this film is all about and want to view these scenes , by all means try to view it without getting sick .
416398	663392	39204	10.0	A Great John Garfield Film !	Every one of John Garfield's ( Charlie Davis ) , " He Ran all the Way " , ' 51 , films was outstanding and in this picture he did a fantastic job as a boxer struggling to make a living in very poor surroundings in New York City along with his mother , Anne Revere ( Anna Davis ) , " Birch Interval " , ' 77 , who tired to go on welfare but her son Charlie would not hear of it and decided to reach to the top of the boxing field . His girlfriend , Lilli Palmer , ( Peg Born ) , " The Other Side of the Wind " , ' 72 , played a great supporting role . However , Lilli Palmer was not exactly the greatest person to play this character . Greatly admired John Garfield and all his films , unfortunately he died making love and his career came to a sudden END !
417298	663392	56732	10.0	Actors all Had B O !	This certainly was a very unusual film where people are invited to dinner and as they no sooner reach the front door and enter , quite a few of the servants decide all of a sudden to just up and leave the entire dinner affair and their jobs . You can only find this film more like a comedy , with people complaining because they just can't seem to leave the darn dinning room . All the characters in the film also seem to complain about each other having a bad Body Odor . There was some sexual fooling around and a few sheep wandering all around the place and a big bad bear who was as frustrated as the people who came for a dinner . One lady had a roaster claws in her purse and somebody was using an electric razor on a lady's legs . If you really want to watch actors doing a fantastic job of acting and a film that repeats itself over and over again . Watch This ONE !
418174	663392	43469	10.0	A GREAT FILM CLASSIC OF GARY COOPER !	Besides being a great fan of Gary Cooper ( Capt . Quincy Wyatt ) " Love In The Afternoon " , ' 57 ; my family wanted to visit Florida and the Castillo de San Marcos Fort in 1951 where a great scene in the film depicts a fight in this famous fort , now a National Monument . My family visited the fort the day after Gary Cooper was at this fort . As many have said , there is great under water photography , actual scenes of Florida during the 1950's which made it more realistic . Gary Cooper carried this entire film on his back and it is truly a great film classic .
417042	663392	167906	10.0	Wal-Mart Special for a Dollar	This is a very interesting film for only $1 . 00 at Wal-Mart and Franco Columbu , ( Enrico Cosata ) gave a great performance with some very sexy ladies , namely : Barbara Nevink ( Veronica ) . Enrico Cosata has a ball in Sardina , Italy and Costa Smeralda trying to help a U S . Senator and at the same time being a tour guide for a very sexy looking blonde . For six years of being a secret agent , Cosata grows tired of his job hunting down multi-national arms dealers in Los Angles and decides to enjoy a nice retirement in Sardina , Italy . However , he meets up with old friends and very bad enemies . There is plenty of action with cars going over cliff's and Enrico finding weapons under every bush in order to fend off his attackers . Great entertaining film and lots of nice looking actresses . Enjoy
416986	663392	60736	10.0	Little Brown Jug How I Love Thee	This is a very unusual film which I had never seen starring Cornel Wilde as THE MAN . The man leads a group of people on a safari in Africa and everything goes quite smoothly and they are able to kill wild elephants for their tusks and encounter a tribe who want them to give them their bounty of tusks and one of the members refuses . As a result , these tribal people become very angry and decided to hunt this party down and kill them and they manage to kill everyone except THE MAN who runs around Africa naked and escapes from all kinds of bugs , snakes , plenty of bows and arrows . There are no females in this picture and Cornel Wilde does find a young tribal boy who helps him and saves him from drowning . The Boy and Cornel Wilde do sing a song which I thought was rather funny which was " Little Brown Jug How I Love Thee " . A very different film which clearly shows how the wild creatures in Africa exists .
416399	663392	53017	10.0	Fantastic Montgomery Clift Film !	Have not seen this film in many years and was able to view it on late late late night TV . Montgomery Clift , ( Adam White ) , " Wild River " , ' 60 gave forth a deep power from within his very soul and cried out through out the entire picture as a frustrated writer in his love relations and the conflict with his own father . Adam encounters a woman who seeks his help through a column in the local newspaper and she complains about her husband's performance in bed after so many years and then all things break loose . Robert Ryan , ( William Shrike ) , " The Outfit " , ' 74 is a very bitter man who heads the newspaper and is constantly beating down his wife , Myrna Loy , ( Florence Shrike ) , " Song of the Thin Man " , ' 47 for having an affair with a man ten years in the past . Maureen Stampleton , ( Fay Doyle ) , " Cocoon " , ' 85 gave a great supporting role and spins a close web around Adam . Montgomery Clift showed a great deal of physical and mental pain in this film , but it seemed to make his performance a MASTER PIECE of great acting for all generations to view .
416283	663392	39437	10.0	About Love & Hate and the Slip of the Pen	Have not viewed this film in years and was completely surprised at almost everything in the entire film . It starts out rather slow , a bit boring and all of a sudden everything seems to happen . Lana Turner , ( Marianne Patourel ) , " The Bad & The Beautiful " , ' 52 , gave one of her greatest performances with a very dramatic acting role along with Van Heflin ( Timothy Haslam ) , " Tap Roots " , ' 46 who could not help but follow Marianne's business advice and also gave in to all her demands . Donna Reed , ( Marguerite Patourel ) , " The Last Time I Saw Paris " , ' 54 , played a woman who was deeply in love through out the entire picture and became very frustrated . Donna Reed gave an outstanding performance and could bring tears to your eyes . Edmund Gwenn ( Octavius Patourel ) , " Miracle on 34th St . " , ' 47 was the father to the two sisters and revealed great secrets as the film progressed . Frank Morgan , ( Dr . Edmund Ozanne ) , " The Wizard of Oz " , ' 39 , played a great supporting role as a heavy drinking doctor who greatly loved his son . I noticed Linda Christian , ( Hin Moa ) , " Thunderstorm " , ' 56 playing a brief role in this film , Linda Christian was the former wife of Tyrone Power . This is a masterpiece of a Classic Film which even had great pictures of Old Clipper Ships with their majestic Sails . Don't miss this Picture .
416377	663392	70040	10.0	Great Foreign Film	This story is basically centered around two little sisters living in Spain who are able to view the classic film " Frankenstein " starring Boris Karloff for the first time . This film leaves a great impression on the younger sister , Ana who is seven years of age and is told by her older sister that she will be able to see the monster at an old farm near a well and if she closes her eyes he will appear to her . Besides the attention being given to these two girls , there is a father who is in his own world of beehives who never makes love to his wife or even speaks to her . The wife is in her dream world and rides her bike everyday and is also writing letters to a romantic encounter in the past . As all this is going on , Ana is teased by her older sister Teresa about the whereabouts of Frankenstein and why he killed a little girl .
416093	663392	364882	10.0	Great Chili Mining Story	Greatly enjoyed viewing this fantastic portrayal of a rich man who owns a Coal Mine and treats the miners as slaves with low wages and poor working conditions . This rich man puts Ernesto Malbran , ( Mister Davis ) as foreman who brutalizes the men and even kills them if they ever think about having a Miners Association , or type of union . Francisco Reyes , ( Fernando ) , " Docteur Chance " , ' 97 grew up in the mine and lost his own father while he was working deep down below in Hell . Paulina Galvez , ( Virginia ) , " Face of Terror " , ' 03 was a former girl friend of Fernando and their romances is renewed as she returns to Lota , Chili to teach in the local school . Virginia and Fernando burn up the bedroom and bed sheets in quite a few scenes and they also look great dancing together . The story of Coal Miners is true in every country in this world , they are never given the true wages they deserve or the safe working conditions , lets hope things improve in the 21st Century . Good Film to Enjoy Watching .
416526	663392	69857	10.0	Classic Acting	Had no idea just how I was going to react to this film and after being rather patient with the slow action taking place in the beginning of the picture , it became interesting . The story is about monks who live in a rather remote area and live with only the bare necessities of life . Their leader is Trevor Howard , ( The Abbot ) , who has caused a great deal of problems with Rome by wanting to say Mass in Latin rather than English . There are other controversial subjects which are mentioned in the film about Communion and how the Body and Blood of Christ is portrayed and how Faith plays a big role in determining how a person wants to believe . Martin Sheen , ( Father Kinsella ) , is a young priest who travels to Rome and tries to stop the problem with Mass still being said in Latin . The Abbot , has some very deep dark secrets which are quite unbelievable , because of the position he holds in the church . If you are not interested in any kind of religion , this is not the film for you .
416079	663392	22059	10.0	GREAT 1931 CLASSIC FILM !	I have never seen this film up until recently and was amazed at the great talent of Joan Crawford ( Ivy " Bunny " Stevens ) " Humoresque " ' 46 with John Garfield . Joan was very sexy and wore very revealing clothes for the early 1930's , her dancing and singing was unbelievable and she was so very pretty , slim and trim , not like the real " Mommie Dearest " character her daughter told us about . Clark Gable ( Carl Loomis ) , " Gone With the Wind " ' 39 was Ivy's prince charming as a Salvation Army convert and when she appears in the park with her beautiful white dress , you just knew there was going to be an immediate CONVERSION OF SOULS ! Veteran actor , Roscoe Karns , ( Gred Geer ) played a great supporting role . This film is filled with surprises , even a little African American Boy stealing a bite from a girls doughnut tore me up , there is many deep soul searching messages in this film and LOTS OF LAUGHTER and one attempted jump off a bridge . ENJOY !
417365	663392	60665	10.0	Classic Film from 1966	Enjoyed this great presentation of Sr . Thomas More played by Paul Scofield who opposed King Henry VIII marriage without a divorce being granted by the Roman Catholic church . Thomas More went face to face with the King and around and around in circles but would never change his mind and disagreed with the King and all his subjects . During this period of time , Martin Luther broke away from the Catholic church and formed the Lutheran Church and there were many people mixing politics with religion , which never is a good mixture even today . Robert Shaw , ( King Henry VIII ) , " Jaws " gave a great supporting role and there was a brief role played by Orson Welles , ( Cardinal Walsey ) which was quite surprising . If you have read some of writings of Sir Thomas More you will also enjoy this film and going way back in time .
417952	663392	57263	10.0	Natalie Wood & Steve MacQueen Were Great	Have always been a great fan of Natalie Wood and Steve MacQueen and they both gave an outstanding performance in this film , their chemistry together was like magic and it made your eyes glued to the screen . Steve McQueen , ( Rocky Papasano ) plays the role as a musician who goes to a musician's gathering for jobs in New York City and all of a sudden , out of the blue , Angie Rossini , ( Natalie Wood ) goes up and meets Rocky and tells him she is pregnant and Rocky acts extremely shocked and makes her run off and eventually he catches up with Angie and he tells her he is going to get a doctor for her in order to have an abortion . Rocky & Angie both are Italian and their families practice the Roman Catholic Faith and of course abortion is a big NO NO . These two couples begin to find some inner truths to their lives and become very close together in their big problems and both their families are eager to come to their aid . Wonderful romance and a cute story which will captivate your attention right to the very end . Enjoy
416402	663392	144214	10.0	A very Naughty General's Daughter !	Enjoyed reading Nelson DeMille's novel which went into more detail concerning the General's Daughter and all the characters who played a major role in this film . John Travolta , ( Warr . Off . Paul Brenner / Sgt . Frank White ) , " Basic " , ' 03 , played an undercover agent , who at times used a Southern accent to accomplish his investigations . The General's Daughter was able to help Sgt . Frank White change a tire and he was charmed by her very sexy looks and great personality . Madeleine Stowe ( Warr . Off . Sara Sunhill ) , " Octave " , ' 03 , worked side by side with Paul Brenner in order to find out just what Timothy Hutton ( Col . William Kent ) , " Secret Window " , ' 04 was doing in his spare time with the General's Daughter , who had a very active sex life with many men . James Woods , ( Col . Robert Moore ) , " The Girl's Life " , ' 03 , had many many secrets that Paul Brenner and Sara Sunhill had to investigate . This is a good John Travolta film , with out his dancing around , and an entirely different role of acting . Enjoy !
417597	663392	64116	10.0	Fantastic WESTERN !	Must have been busy during the year 1968 to have missed such a great Western film with Great Actors of the Silver Screen ! The picture captured my interest from the very start to the finish . The photography of the pioneer days with a railroad being built in great detail , old railroad cars and outstanding scenery made this a Classic Film . Henry Fonda , ( Frank ) , " Home to Stay " , ' 78 TV , played a very very hateful character who caused a great deal of pain to many people in this film . Claudia Cardinale , ( Jill McBain ) , " Sniper " , ' 87 , was a very strong willed woman who would do ANYTHING to save her life or her ambitions and had some very warm and sexy scenes . Jason Robards , ( Manuel ' Cheyenne ' Gulierrez ) , " Square Dance " , ' 87 , played a very interesting character who had a great deal of depth to his way of thinking ! Charles Bronson , ( Harmonica ) , " Love & Bullets " , ' 79 , made his eyes pierce right into your body and soul and had a great PAYBACK to finalize with a certain PERSON ! Great film , ENJOY !
417041	663392	278406	10.0	Great Submarine Film	Have always been a big fan of Gerald McRaney , ( Admiral Eugene Justice ) who gave an outstanding supporting role in this Naval story about a struggle between Commander Miles Sheffield , ( Casper Van Dien ) who became the skipper of the Lansing Sub over Lt . Commander Albert Kenner , ( Stewart Bick ) . However , when North Korea sets off a nuclear bomb and completely upsets all the crew on the Lansing and causes many mental problems among the entire crew on board . This is something like the " Caine Mutiny " except the Lansing can possibly destroy many innocent nations of the world . There is plenty of great acting and there is only one female Lt . in this film who assists Admiral Eugene Justice and in many ways solved many major decisions in finding out just where the Lansing Submarine can be found . This is a very entertaining film with plenty of suspense and important decisions to make in a matter of a few seconds . Enjoy .
417139	663392	36244	10.0	No Justice At All	This is a great film because it shows how people took the law into their own hands and judged men before they had a fair trial in this Western Film from 1943 . Henry Fonda , ( Gil Carter ) gave a great performance in this film and it was a film that Fonda enjoyed making and even requested being able to play this role . Anthony Quinn , ( Juan Martinez ) portrayed a Mexican man who spoke many languages and was being accused of a crime he did not commit and gave a great supporting role through out the entire film . Dana Andrews , ( Donald Martin ) also was accused of a crime he did not commit and had a young wife and children who was blamed for cattle stealing and murder . I was surprise to see Jane Darwell , ( Jenny Grier ) being the only woman who was out for blood and loved to see a hanging . Great Fonda film , worth seeing , enjoy .
417482	663392	36265	10.0	Marsha Hunt Gave a Great Performance !	It was great seeing this picture and seeing a great beautiful Lady , and actress named Marsha Hunt . She appeared in many pictures in Hollywood and in this picture she stars with a leading man of the 30's and 40's Franchot Tone , ( Lt . George Braynor Collins ) , " Advise and Consent " , ' 62 . Marsha Hunt , Fredie Andrew / Collins ) , " Blue Denium " , ' 59 , was not appreciated as she should have been in Hollywood and was not given the proper roles she deserved . In this picture she plays a woman caught between two men , Gene Kelly ( Lt . Vito S . Alessandro ) , " Brigadoon " , ' 54 , who is madly in love with her and also lets her know how he really feels . There are flash backs in this film about all these men who are pilots and fighting against Japan in WW II . It was very interesting seeing Gene Kelly acting instead of " Dancing In The Rain " , as he did in the many musicals he use to appear in for MGM . Van Johnson ( Lt . Everett Arnold ) , " Subway in the Sky " , ' 59 , even appeared in this picture very young and just starting out in his career . A great film with many great Classic actors . It is nice to know that Marsha Hunt will have a Birthday on Oct 17th , she will be 87 years younger !
417050	663392	265459	10.0	Lots of Picture Taking	Some how I seemed to have missed this picture and was amazed at the great acting of Robin Williams as a photo clerk who took his job very serious and envied a local family , especially the young attractive mom , Connie Nielsen , ( Nina Yorkin ) , " Return to Sender " , ' 04 , who enjoyed all the comforts of home and some what neglected her husband in the bedroom . Robin Williams , ( Sy Parrish ) , " The Final Cut " , ' 04 , put his heart and soul into every picture that he developed and had a very very large Album of his own at home . Sy Parrish had a very dark dark mental problem from his youth and it seemed to give him problems as he became very close to the Yorkin family and their son . If you like Robin Williams talent , this is definitely an entirely different role he had to perform in .
417218	663392	339135	10.0	Horror's of Men in Prison	Jean-Claude Van Damme , ( Kyle ) , " Wake of Death " , ' 04 , wound up in prison just because of police stupidity and has a life sentence in a place no person would ever want to stay even for five ( 5 ) minutes . Kyle encounters all kinds of strange people and very horny men who desire sex the Hersey way and lots more . The prison personnel and their wives enjoyed watching boxing matches in which the prisoners fought to kill each other . There was all kinds of corruption among the guards and inmates , some of them betrayed their fellow inmates , which sent them to sewers and filthy conditions to sleep and eat . Jean-Claude Van Damme and the cast of actors did a fantastic acting performance , a very graphic story about the horrors of men in prison .
416312	663392	90203	10.0	Page Finally Won an Oscar	Always have been a big fan of Geraldine Page and in this film Page played the role of an older woman , ( Mrs . Carrie Watts ) who lives with her son , Ludie Watts , ( John Heard ) and his wife , Jessie Mae , ( Carlin Glynor ) in a very small apartment in Houston , Texas . All these people do not get along very well because Carrie Watts wants to return to her old home in Bountiful , Texas which she misses so dearly . Ludie feels that his mother is not very well to travel by herself and live alone and does not want his mother to leave . Jessie Mae wants her mother-in-law to stay because she can use her social security check which Carrie tries to hind in order to make her escape . Carrie has tried many times to get away and you will have to view this film in order to see if Carrie ever does get away to her dream town of Bountiful , Texas .
416328	663392	196267	10.0	Very Entertaining Film	Viewed the first " Cruel Intentions " and was not certain if this second film would measure up to the first one . Keri Lynn Pratt , ( Cherie Claymon ) , " Fat Albert " , ' 04 , put her heart and soul into this picture and was able to make it a great success along with Robin Dunne , ( Sebastian Valmont ) , " The Skulls II " , ' 02 . Sebastian and Cherie burned up the screen with sex , double meaning statements and lots of comic action through out the entire picture . The fathers and mothers in this film did their own thing sexually and there was plenty of AC & DC secrets being with held that will surprise you . Sit back , relax and let this film entertain you to know END .
417546	663392	74937	10.0	Classic Comedy Film	Over the years I missed this film and really appreciated viewing great actors from the past and present who were able to perform Drama as well as , COMEDY . The story starts out with all the famous Hollywood detectives from the past namely , Charlie Chan , Nick & Nora Charles etc . , who were all called different names in this picture . They are invited to a dinner where a murder is going to be witnessed and of course there will be clues to the guilt person or persons . Eileen Brennan , ( Tess Skeffington ) , was a partner to Peter Falk and was very young looking in 1976 , she was the Sgt . in " Private Benjamin " , and gave a great performance in this film as a tipsy blonde gal . Truman Capote , ( Lionel Twain ) , " In Cold Blood " , made an appearance but his acting was horrible , but funny , considering he is an author and not in the acting field . This is a great film to view and enjoy , even if you have not seen it in a long time . Nancy Walker was a maid and did a great job of saying not a WORD !
416816	663392	36112	10.0	Masterpiece of a Film	Enjoyed this film starring Roger Livesey , ( Clive Candy ) who is a general who returned from the Boer War during the First World War and gets himself involved with politics and decides he is going to try and create better relations with German . This better relations in Germany involves a very pretty young woman named Edith Hunter , ( Deborah Kerr ) who plays different roles in this film and there are many different situations that Clive Candy experiences as he learns who are his friends and enemies and at the same time he gets deeply involved with a woman who is 20 years younger than he is . This film goes into great detail about the times in London and Germany during the First World War and at the same time creates a nice romance with a very young Deborah Kerr who was only twenty-two years of age in 1943 . Good Film , Enjoy .
418044	663392	430457	10.0	Barbara Niven Was Red HOT	This picture opens up with a murder being committed and you see the killer and understand almost immediately why this person was permitted to have a very short life on earth . There was a great deal of hatred in the killers face and a real dark dark side , along with a tortured deep mental problem . Barbara Niven , ( Donna Germaine ) , " The Drone Virus " , ' 04 , put her heart and soul into this role and showed what a great talent she has to offer Hollywood . Donna gets her complete mind , body and soul into getting a SOUL MATE for life and will do anything that will accomplish her goal . Human life is taken left and right through out the picture and everything is a perfect crime to go along with the Title of the film , " A Perfect Neighbor " . Enjoy .
417249	663392	377524	10.0	Great STORY and Fantastic ACTING !	This made for TV Film had a wonderful cast of actors , fantastic photography of the coast line of Ireland with its quaint cottages and lighthouse . Keith McErlean ( Declan ) , " At Death's Door " , ' 99 became sick with AIDS and his family came to his aid along with his faithful loving men friends . His mother , Dianne Wiest , " I am Sam " , ' 02 and grandmother , Angela Lansbury ( Dora ) , " Gaslight " , ' 44 " , along with his sister found out he was gay and did not realize how deeply he was loved . Coping with the AIDS in the family magically drew all the immediate family together and they came to terms with their great misunderstanding of each other . Old and Young a like had a great learning experience and were able to accept the FEELINGS they all deeply shared with its other . Words cannot describe the great message this film had to offer along with the great physical suffering AIDS can cause to the human body . If you missed this picture , view it the next time it is shown on TV ! !
418162	663392	82696	10.0	Excellent Halloween Film	This film is full of blood and gore , however , it starts out with a group of young camp leaders and young children who are getting ready to end their camp tour . This group are having a good time telling creepy stories and one story teller tells them about an old farmer who goes crazy and starts chopping up human bodies and it just so happens that his old home is still standing on the property of the camp grounds . There are plenty of young couples who manage to make love and there are also ones who are fighting all the time about making love or not . If you like a good horror film with lots of thrills and chills , don't miss this good Halloween Film .
417052	663392	75194	10.0	Holmes Had A Drug Problem	Always enjoyed the great Sherlock Holmes films during the 1940's and in this picture we see a different side to Sherlock Holmes and many of his deep mental secrets concerning Professor James Moriarity . Alan Arkin , ( Dr . Sigmund Freud ) , " The Novice " , ' 04 gave a great performance trying to put Holmes back together as a human being and a great detective . Robert Duvall , ( Dr . John Watson ) , " John Q " , ' 02 , played an entirely different Dr . Watson , who did everything he could be help his sidekick get back to a better way of living . Laurence Oliver , ( Professor James Moriarity ) , " Inchon " , ' 81 , gave another great performance to his role as the sinister dark monster of a personality . There is all kinds of action concerning trains and lots of swords swinging in the breeze . This is a very different kind of Holmes film and shows that the famous detective has human faults like everyone else .
418046	663392	285531	10.0	The Creatures in this film are a complete HORROR !	Found this Steven King story quite interesting in how it dealt with four guys who put up a Dreamcatcher to catch all their nightmares . There are plenty of flashbacks between the four guys and each experiences their own problems and how they deal with them . All of a sudden you find Helicopters flying all over the place and the Government Top Brass trying to prevent a tragic situation which will effect the entire country and world . At one point , you come face to face with this really horrible looking creature you really hope you never have to face in real life . There is only one person who can think up something so Horrifying , and that is Steven King . Enjoy !
417281	663392	82089	10.0	EXTREMELY HOT !	Viewed this film many years ago and was always spellbound by the music and the tricky plot that kept you wondering until the very end . The talents of William Hurt ( Ned Racine ) and Kathleen Turner ( Matty Walker ) ( " Crimes of Passion " with Anthony Perkins ) along with the late Richard Crenna ( " Judging Amy " TV Series ) and last but not least Ted Danson ( Peter Lowenstein ) of " Cheers " and " Becker " made this a great 1980's classic . The tricky and passionate Matty Walker made this a very steamy flick , even the outdoor chimes and the trumpet playing jazz in the beginning of the picture set the pace and of course the ICE CREAM CONE SPILLING ON Kathleen Turner's dress and her choice words afterwards , last but not least , the chair thrown into the window and the fun on the stairs ! This film was just the stepping stone for these great actors and it is a must see film to be placed in your library of great flicks .
417630	663392	244244	10.0	JOHN TRAVOLTA SHOWED HIS DARK SIDE OF ACTING !	John Travolta ( Gabriel Shear ) , " Blow Out " , 81 , was able to perform as an evil , misguided Robin Hood who enjoyed the wonderful company of Halle Berry ( Ginger ) , " Race The Sun " , ' 96 . The director put everything into this movie that he could think of : Flying Bus , Computer puzzles to solve , lots of shoot it up action and torrid steamy scenes with Halle Berry . These two actors carried this picture on their backs . This film showed the public that John Travolta can perform in any role he is given a chance to act in . Sit back , enjoy and try not to be tooo critical with the plot . The ending is something like this : " Crime Does Not Pay " . ! ! !
418103	663392	44413	10.0	Fantastic Photography & Great Western Story !	This is truly a great Classic Western with the best super stars of all time . The special photography with cattle going up and down rocky hills and the many covered wagons and beautiful scenery of the Northwest was outstanding . James Stewart , ( Glyn McLyntock ) , " Broken Arrow " , ' 50 , was a wagon train guide , and also had a wicked past life he was trying to forget about . Glyns wicked past came in hand having to face many situations that required lots of fighting and gun action . Arthur Kennedy ( Emerson Cole ) , " Nevada Smith " , ' 66 gave a very outstanding performance and also gave Glyn a real hard time because they both had past careers that were almost the same , however , Glyn was hateful deep in his very soul ! Julie Adams , ( Laura Baile ) , " Slim Carter " , ' 57 was very beautiful and had a hard time trying to find out which guy she really wanted to HOOK ! Rock Hudson , ( Trey Wilson ) , " Iron Man , " , ' 51 , was a gambler and gave a rather weak performance , however , he was just starting his career and took almost any role that he was presented with . Jimmy Stewart always was very particular about any picture that he appeared in and I can see why he liked this film . Enjoy ! !
416952	663392	51758	10.0	Susan Hayward was Fantastic	Always enjoyed most of the films that Susan Hayward appeared in and her acting was outstanding and she was a very beautiful lady of the Silver Screen . In this True to Live Story , Susan plays , Barbara Graham , ( Valley of the Dolls " , ' 67 , who loves life , having a good time and also a con-artist who does petty things . However , Barbara gets involved with some so called friends who sort of sell her down the river and her life becomes very complicated and at times very tragic . Susan Hayward holds the picture together with outstanding acting and portrays the horrible facts of life Barbara Graham had to encounter in all kinds of disappointing situations . Great film , don't miss it .
417063	663392	48563	10.0	Wonderful Acting !	It has been years since I viewed this great B & W film with great stars like Anna Magnani , ( Serafine Delle Rose ) , " Wild Is The Wind " , ' 57 , who played the role of an Italian woman who was deeply in love with her husband and thought he was a GOD ! She had a daughter who she loved and over protected until she meets a handsome young Sailor . As the story progresses , Burt Lancaster , ( Alvaro Mangiacovallo ) , " Atlantic City " , ' 80 gets involved with Serafine and the film becomes a real Spin Zone . There is lots of drama , suspense , romance , and lots of comical scenes with wild fighting and screaming . Anna Magnani made this her first American film and won many awards for her great acting skills . A young Burt Lancaster gave an outstanding supporting role which launched his great acting career !
416450	663392	48424	10.0	Mitchum was Outstanding	This is a great film from 1955 which you will want to watch over and over again . I have not seen this film for many years but I remember how great Robert Mitchum played the role as Harry Powell , a religious nut case . Harry Powell , met up with a man called Ben Harper , ( Peter Graves ) who was sentenced to prison for killing two men and they were both prison cell mates . Apparently , Ben stole ten thousand dollars and had hid it somewhere and was being sentenced to death . Harry tries to get Ben to tell him where the money is hidden before he is hanged . However , Ben tells him about his family and a boy and girl he has in a certain town . After Ben is executed , Harry get released from prison and seeks out his family . Harry puts on a big show as a religious minister who is a God fearing man and marries Willa Harper , ( Shelly Winters ) in order to take control of the children and find out just where this money is hidden . Vetran actress Lilliam Gish plays the role as Rachael Cooper . James Gleason gives a great supporting role . Don't miss this film , you will want to see it over and over again .
417216	663392	482491	10.0	Excellent Film	If you had a mother like the one in this picture , I would begin to wonder how you ever deserved such a horrible position in Life . It sure is a great comedy and at the same time a drama that keeps you wondering just how things will eventually turn out in the very end . If you go out to dinner , you had better worry about the salt and pepper shakers and all morale codes of conduct are completely disregarded . The picture is a bit drawn out and you begin to wonder just when justice will prevail . This is a true story and you really feel sorry for the poor people involved in this family , but you just have to remember it is only a film , so sit back and enjoy the Comedy in this film .
416920	663392	59630	10.0	About a Girl Nynphomaniac	This story starts off with a young girl named Grace Caldwell Tate , ( Suzanne Pleshette ) who is attacked and forcefully raped and does not report the matter but assumes this is a normal procedure between a girl and boy . Grace begins to have other encounters with men and causes all kinds of problems in her home and mostly her mother and brother . Jack Hollister , ( Peter Graves ) married Grace and they have a little boy and Grace continues to have an affair with Roger Bannon , ( Ben Gazzara ) and this film continues to go on with Grace never able to say a simple word like " NO " , and leave " Me Alone " . This is a mental sickness that can be corrected , but the person involved suffers horrible consequences . Great acting by Suzanne Pleshette and the entire cast . This is a very sad story and these type of people need help .
