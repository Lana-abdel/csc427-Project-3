417556	663392	295254	1.0	Thought It Was Going to Be Better than This	Thought this just might be a great picture concerning a mystery murder involved with the Internet and was sadly disappointed as the film progressed to go down hill . Stephen Dorff , ( Detective Mike Reilly ) , " Alone in the Park " , was finally convinced that what he thought was the death of many young girls was a illness spreading throughout New York City . However , Natascha McElhone , ( Terry Hudson ) , who played the role as Board of Health specialist told Mike Reilly that she believed all these young girls where killed because of a website they visited . This film goes into a complete spin out of control and never stops until the very end . Don't waste your time viewing this film , no matter how cheap it sells for in the stores .
417419	663392	95389	1.0	GREAT ACTING BY SPADER & GIBB !	Jack the Ripper films are one of my favorite , however , this film was boring and very unrealistic . I simply could not wait until it finally ended and the real Jack the Ripper was finally revealed . However , I knew who Jack the Ripper was from the very beginning of the picture . James Spader ( John / Rick Westford ) " I Witness " ' 03 , gave a great dual performance and is a great up and coming actor along with Cynthia Gibb ( Chris Moscari ) " A Crime of Passion " ' 03 TV , who loved John Westford and became very close with Rick . These actors did a great job with a horrible script about nothing !
417068	663392	303816	1.0	Lots of Throwing UP	After viewing this film , I completely lost my appetite because of the fact that everybody seemed to be coughing up lots of blood . The story starts out with two girls and three guys who plan on having a nice vacation in a cabin away from everything . The gang stop at grocery store and get some refreshment's and a little girl who loves to bite people , gave one of the guys a good nip or two on the hand . This was rather strange and then the story progresses into a bedroom scene where a couple are making hot sex together and another guy decides to go squirrel hunting and shoots a man in the woods . Rider Strong , ( Paul ) " Borderline " , ' 05 had a good time with Cerina Vincent , ( Marcy ) , " It Waits " , ' 05 who had a very sexy body and gave an outstanding performance . Jordan Ladd , ( Karen ) , " Club Dread " , ' 04 teased and never pleased her boyfriend who was sex starved and needed attention which he finally received from Marcy . If you need a blood transfusion and enjoy viewing throwing up in the truck or any place , this is definitely the film for YOU .
417324	663392	56875	1.0	Great Halloween Film	This picture showed nice looking gals which did brighten up this so called story about Egyptian rituals and a caterer who enjoyed his meat prepared on the raw side of things . There is a serial killer on the loose who does horrible things to all the females he captures and you will have to see the film because the scenes are too graphic to describe , except that it is real gore and blood all over the place . The worst thing about this film is the poor acting by all the actors and the fake hair or powder to make a person look old . This is a film you will enjoy seeing on Halloween night and you are trying to get all spooked up about old Egyptian customs and what happens to poor young virgins . Sick film
416206	663392	102187	1.0	Entertaining Film	This was a great martial arts film starring John Travis , ( Ronald L . Marchini ) who finds himself living in the world as the last cop on earth . John has a hat that reads : " Special Cop " who runs into all kinds of horrible looking men and women who want to kill the last cop on earth . John Travis meets up with a woman named Rachel , ( Carrie Chambers ) who is badly beaten up , Rachel tries to protect all the children in the various surrounding cities and they call them Free-Bees and she offers them a nice shelter to live in . Rachel is also a scientist who has knowledge of Teleportation which can transport people from one area in the country to another , something like a time machine . However , Rachel has a broken crystal which enables her to transport human beings into other places . Rachel asks John Travis to assist her in obtaining this crystal which she tells John he should have no problems in trying to secure this new crystal , which turns out to be very false statement to John . There is plenty of action in the B film with horrible acting , but lots of fun to just watch and enjoy .
417129	663392	209020	1.0	Dying Production	Decided to tape a film from TV which was scheduled for around 1AM and soon found out why it was hidden away in the wee hours of the AM . Always liked John Heard as an actor and he did a great job trying to hold this film together along with actors who just did not measure up as supporting actors . Most of the film showed John Heard drinking beer . throwing a beer bottle against the wall of his apartment and blowing smoke rings . There was constant flash backs of his young daughter running into the street after a ball she was playing with and his wife who was pregnant . I must say this film was not worth watching , it actually put me to sleep , causing me to rewind the tape to find out what finally happened at the end . This is a real SLEEPER of a FILM .
417402	663392	443450	1.0	A Slight Bit Better	This film is really called Foreigner 2 : Black Dawn and Steven Seagal , ( Jonathan Cold ) once again appears in this film as a real bad dude dealing with all the horrible under-world characters . Seagal even directed this film and the stunts and action were very low key and not performed very professional . It looks like Jonathan Cold put on a few extra pounds and and is acting more like Marlon Brando with his almost silent whispers . Jonathan meets up with a gal he had known years ago and a very good looker , he does manage to save her from a very close shave with death . There are plenty of explosions and the real bomb is when you start watching this film and wonder when it will ever end . It is about time to put an end to these Foreigner series and move on to something more interesting .
418115	663392	110141	1.0	Suppose to be a Shocker ?	What a big surprise I received when I started viewing this DVD , there is really nothing I can say about this so called film . The actors did a fantastic job of portraying mixed up and confused young people , who use only four letter words mostly with " F " and one subject deals strictly with girls and one guy talking about men's private parts . There is a girl getting hit on and the guy getting to First Base and at the same time giving her a very hard time . The producer tries to shock his audience with conversations about believing in God or not , lesbian behavior , a guy who loves whores and a rather strange relationship between a father and his son . There is constant bad language and there is no story . The DVD cover has Drew Barrymore starring in this film , and this is a very false statement as well as this film .
418050	663392	330634	3.0	Big BUG Is Mad & Hungry !	Enjoyed this film and the great acting by Karl Geary ( Marvin ) , who did a great job of acting like a person who had Strickland Disease and had me completing feeling sorry for him . Marvin's big hobby was being a simple PEEPING TOM , who enjoyed watching all his neighbor's , old , young and in between . I think his favorite window to look into was Carmen , ( Rebecca Nader ) , who seemed to get hot and bothered over Marvin and his great hobby of posting pictures all over the wall and especially hers ! Marvin's sister Rosy , ( Alexis Dziena ) was the person who introduced Marvin to Carmen and this of course started a wonderful relationship . There is plenty of mystery concerning the horrible habits of a Judas Bug that gets so hungry he tries to break into the trunk of a car . This film is entertaining and does not need to be put under a microscope and studied , if you don't like the beginning , Turn it Off !
417077	663392	25384	3.0	Enjoyed this Picture As A COMEDY !	While viewing this film , I found myself laughing through out the entire picture . Diana Wynyard ( Alice Overton ) , " Gaslight " , ' 40 , was married to Clive Brook , ( Dr . Jack Overton ) , " Love in Exile " , ' 36 and this couple seemed to argue and fight all the time , Alice kissed a friend innocently in the garden and all sorts of problems started . Jack Overton decided their marriage after ten years was becoming boring and wanted a divorce . This divorce became off again on again through out the entire picture . The Butler , ( Phillips ) Arthur Hoyt , " Hail The Conquering Hero " , ' 44 did not know if he was coming or going , bringing luggage out to the car and back again and finally was claimed a hero in possibly saving this marriage . This was definitely a COMEDY and should not be taken seriously at ALL !
417303	663392	96182	4.0	Sad TV Film from 1988	Ben Masters , ( Kyd Thomas ) , " Dream Lover " , ' 86 plays a sort of Mike Hammer character , a private eye who does any old job for a buck and never misses out on all the sexy curves of good looking gals . Kyd makes one big mistake when he stops Morgan Fairchild , ( Laura Cassidy / Eva Bomberg ) , " Arizona Summer " , ' 73 from getting beaten up and raped . Kyd takes Laura home to his pad and when he wakes up , she is out on his patio eating his eggs and orange juice and making herself right at home . By the way , Kyd sleep in his bed and Laura slept on the couch for this particular scene . Laura is mixed up with all kinds of hoods and there are some hot scenes between Kyd and Laura . All said and done , this is a lousy picture and I purchased the DVD for only $1 . 50 and I really got ripped OFF !
417735	663392	120847	5.0	Same Old Same Old	This film takes place in NYC at a High School that is more like a prison , with wire screens and a huge security system through out the entire school . Treat Williams , ( Karl Thomasson ) , " Venomus " , ' 02 , becomes a substitute in this high school in order to find out who killed his brother . Susan May Pratt , " Open Water " , ' 06 , plays the daughter who lost her father and Karl comes to her aid and tries to help her during her tragic loss . Michael Michele , " Dark Blue " , ' 02 gives a great supporting role and gets very close on the couch with Karl . There is plenty of the hood scenes in the class room with a radio being thrown out a window and plenty of action in the mens room . This is another type film we have seen many times before .
417496	663392	105104	6.0	A Wesley Snipes Classic Film	Always enjoy the fantastic talent of Wesley Snipes , ( John Cutter ) , " Blade Trinity " , ' 04 , who gives an outstanding performance with his hand-to-hand combat action scenes and comical comments . There is a bit of friction between John Cutter and a hot sexy airline stewardess and the gals just seem to burst with joy at just looking at him . Bruce Payne , ( Charles Rane ) , " One Point O " , played a nut case of a bad guy in this film and had fun with a small boy on the airplane playing shoot'em Up with their fingers , until the little boy noticed he had handcuffs on his wrists . There was plenty of action and one of Wesley Snipes great Classic films Enjoy .
417515	663392	61383	6.0	Great Robert Wagner Film !	Viewed this film in the movie houses and then was able to tape this film from TV . I thought that Robert Wagner ( Mike Banning ) , " Hart to Hart " , TV series'79 showed his great acting skills and his charming ways as a golfer who was playing the role with his game of golf and acted like a real LADIES MAN ! with all the wives and charming available hot looking women . Jill St . John , ( Angela Barr ) , " Tony Rome " , 67 , put on the charm for Mike Banning and was pretty hot even in 1967 ! Gene Hackman ( Tommy Del Gaddo ) " The Split " , ' 68 was thin young and just starting out and from his performance , you just knew he would be a super star as he is today ! I also enjoyed the great musical theme song that was played through out the picture , which was written by a great musician and composer , " QUINCY JONES " . If you can catch this movie on TV , it is worth watching , and especially if you like the game of GOLF and all the things that GO ON , in the CLUB HOUSE !
417385	663392	100994	6.0	Needed a Better Ending !	Thought I was going to like this film , and it was not bad , with Billy the Kid , ( Charlie Sheen ) , acting wild and crazy as ever and shooting everything in sight along with some of his sidekicks . Noticed WIlliam L . Peterson , ( Pat Garrett ) , who knew Billy in the past and had a great get together in a Whore House , which turned out to be a complete circus . It was strange viewing Bill L . Peterson on the screen , I kept thinking about CSI , Las Vegas , and how he has become a big star on TV . James Coburn , ( John Chisum ) , gave a brief appearance as a nasty character who had plenty of money but did not want to share it with anyone in need , namely , Billy The Kid . This film did not measure up to the first film and really needed a better ending , I must say , Billy the Kid looked pretty SAD !
416997	663392	312358	6.0	Interesting Film	Enjoyed viewing this German film and the very strange story about a young man who is studying to become a doctor and decides to get some intern work with poor people who are not able to afford medical services . This doctor hits it lucky and meets some very important doctors who are very famous and is accepted into their hospital . After being in the hospital for a brief period of time , he meets a young female doctor who asks him to strip naked and even grabs his private parts for a sex experiment . As the film progresses , there are very weird experiments performed and plenty of drugs are being used constantly through out this hospital . Some parts of the hospital are nothing but Butcher Shops with plenty of blood and gore , plus plenty of cuts being performed on human bodies . The only female in the picture is very hot to trot , but is very ugly and old .
417964	663392	64679	6.0	Anouk Aimee was Beautiful	Enjoyed this film from the very beginning to the end and the wonderful photographs of Los Angele , California . George Matthews , ( Gary Lockwood ) sets his eyes on a beautiful woman named Lola , ( Anouk Aim ) who is a model in a strange shop . George is having a hard time trying to find himself in Los Angeles , and he does not work , but has plenty of friends who loan him money and at the same time he is living with a gal who is getting tired of George being so lazy in life . There is also a finance company trying to reposes his BMW and things are getting pretty rough for George . You will definitely not be able to figure out how this film is going to end .
417036	663392	382077	6.0	Entertaining Film	Enjoy almost every film that Robert DeNiro performs in and was surprised at the role he played in this film as David Callaway a child psychologist . This story starts out with a tragic incident that happens to David Callaway's wife and his daughter , Emily , ( Dakota Fanning ) views this entire horrible scene and is effected mentally and almost goes into a complete coma . David Callaway decides to take her away from New York City and go to a home he purchases in upstate New York in order to give her a new surroundings . Dr . Callaway has help from his local neighbors and especially his acquaintances with Katherine , ( Famke Janssen ) who is liked by Emily and also a psychologist . This is a good entertaining film , but I did not feel that this was the correct role for Robert DeNiro , I have seen him in much better films and I think he made a bad mistake in starring in this film .
416572	663392	47603	6.0	Great Classic Wellman Film	Whenever William Wellman produced a picture , you can expect a deep and profound story with lots of dark sides to the characters and very unusual photography . This film takes place high in the mountains of the Northwest with plenty of snow and the peril of a panther stalking the livestock of farms . Robert Mitchum , ( Curt Bridges ) is the sort of head of the family and seems to have a clip on his shoulders towards most of his family . His father is an all the time Drunk who is completely worthless and his mother , ( Buelah Bondi ) Ma Bridges professes to be a Bible Reading Christian , but has a dark side and loves only Curt . If you like a story from 1954 with Veteran Classic actors , this is definitely the film for you .
417210	663392	94638	6.0	Suzanne Pleshette Was Great	Suzanne Pleshette , ( Capt . Janet Hamilton ) gave an outstanding performance as an experienced female officer who has been assigned to clean up a bad section of Pittsburgh , Pa . , where police officers rob jewelry stores and deal with prostitutes . Danny Aiello , ( Chief ) enlists the help of Janet to clean up this police station where even policemen are being killed because they know too much . Capt . Hamilton is also upsetting her husband and they are beginning to start going their separate ways until things start to change in the police station . There are many threats made to Capt . Hamilton , however , their were loyal officers who stood behind her and decided to start informing on their fellow officers . Suzanne Pleshette surprised me with her great acting as a tough Captain who could clean up a very bad police department .
416628	663392	29565	6.0	Great Classic 1937 Film	Enjoyed this 1937 film version of Sherlock Holmes , ( Arthur Wontner ) and Ian Fleming , ( Dr . Watson ) who are both on vacation and are invited to Sir . Baskedervilles who has a very great horse called Silver Blaze and Sherlock finds out the horse is entered in an important horse race and has disappeared and the trainer has been murdered . Holmes and Dr . Watson find out that Professor Moriarty is behind this horse theft in order to stop Silver Blaze from ever winning the race and Moriarty has also managed to view the horse race and had one of his henchman fire shots at the jockey running the race . I must say , that I really enjoyed Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce who in later years appeared in their 1940's film version of Sherlock Holmes same story .
416443	663392	51673	6.0	Fred MacMurray Plays a Different Role	This film starts out with a typical bank robbery which has been cleverly planned until a bank employee shoots at one of the robbers and the city Marshall is killed by a young guy named Eddie , ( The Kid ) . Ben Cutler , ( Fred MacMurray ) shoots some of the robbers and half of the money is returned . Ben Cutler claims that the Kid killed the city Marshall and he intends to bring him up on trial and a death sentence . The results of the trial change the direction of the film and it takes on in another direction which makes this a very interesting film . Fred MacMurray was able to show his great acting ability as a Western Marshall and he gave an outstanding performance .
417014	663392	82498	6.0	Lots of Blood & Gore	Enjoyed this horror film which held my interest from the beginning to the very end . It was also a big surprise for me to see veteran actor , Glenn Ford playing the role of Dr . David Faraday to Melissa Sue Anderson , ( Virginia ' Ginny ' Wainwright ) . The film starts off with Ginny visiting her mothers grave who had died in her past and Ginny has a complete loss of memory due to brain surgery . Ginny has returned to her college after her surgery and has many girl friends and quite a few male admires , one guy sneaked into her bedroom and watched her undress and stole her panties and scared her to death . You will never be able to figure out just who the serial killer is right up to Ginny's Birthday Party . Great Mystery Film , enjoy !
416419	663392	64328	6.0	Yul Brynner was Outstanding	If you are a big fan of Yul Brynner who plays the role of a U . S . Secret Service agent named Peter Novak , you will enjoy his great performance dealing with Scotland Yard policemen and a very dangerous counterfeiting ring of thugs . Novak joins up with his partner , Edward Woodward , ( Arthur Thompson ) who works for Scotland Yard and the two of them decide to work their way into this counterfeiting gang who are very clever and will kill you at the drop of a dime . Peter Novak runs into all kinds of situations and even a brothel and message parlors . This film runs rather long and it seemed to me they could have cut a great deal of this film on the cutting room floor , and the ending was very disappointing . However , all the actors in this film gave an outstanding performance and it was great to see this Classic 1969 film .
417503	663392	339412	6.0	Bernie Mac & Angela Bassett did Their Thing	Enjoyed this film primarily because of the great acting of Bernie Mac , " Guess Who " , and his girlfriend in the film , Angela Bassett , ( Maureen " Mo " Simmons ) , " Sunshine State " . Bernie plays the role of a super baseball player who winds up having to prove himself all over again in the eyes of the Hall of Fame Judges . There are plenty of laughs and some very warm and sexy scenes with " Mo " who plays a CNN News reporter who has interviews with Bernie and has a quick tongue in response to his remarks about being in love and wanting to tie the knot . If it were not for the above mentioned actors , this film would have fallen completely on its head . Thanks Bernie Mac !
416985	663392	78869	6.0	Entertaining Walt Disney Space Film	This film is very entertaining dealing with a research vessel which has a great cast of actors namely : Anthony Perkins , ( Dr . Alex Durant ) , Ernest Borgnine , ( Harry McCrae ) , Dr . Kate McCrae , ( Yvette Mimieux ) along with a Robot . This space vessel travels through space and discovers a missing ship commanded by a mysterious scientist on the edge of the Black Hole . The mysterious scientist gains control of the research vessel and when they all meet , they find out that these people were considered lost in space and that Dr . Hans Reinhart , ( Maximilian Schell ) managed to establish a great space station and how he controls the space ship with robots and human being transformed into robots . Dr . Reinhart feels like he is a god and intends to bring his space station directly into the Black Hole . Dr . Alex Durant wants to stay with Dr . Reinhart and the only female in this picture is also being abducted on this space ship into hell .
417035	663392	44547	6.0	A Real Gem of a Film	This is a Gene Kelly film which I had never viewed and only associated Kelly as a song and dance actor in many musicals . Kelly plays the role as Capt . Jeff Eliot who visits the Lehrt family in Germany who protected him and his plane during WW II . However , he finds out that the family was killed and the only member in the family remaining was Wilhelmina Lehrt , ( Pier Angeli ) . Jeff Eliot finds Willie working in a nightclub and they seem to fall in love with each other , until Jeff finds out some very dark secrets Wilhelmina had been keeping from him and they have a fight between the two of them . Claus Clausen , ( Heisemann ) plays the role of a Nazi Commander during the Neo-Nazism Post WW II and has complete control over an underground movement that wants to continue the Hitler movement in Germany . There are really outstanding photography inside Adolph Hitler's Berchtesgard Eagles Nest , which is all bombed out and you see Heisemann standing in front of the large window in Berchtesgard . There is plenty of suspense and good supporting actors like Richard Egan , ( Lt . Parker ) and even some romance . Enjoy
417143	663392	59678	6.0	Mass Destruction	This is a good Sci-Fi Thriller about a secret laboratory that is studying Biochemical Weapons Research out in a remote desert area of Arizona . This secret plant is invaded by people who want to obtain this certain chemical which is called the " Satan Bug " in order to have complete control over the entire world which can cause complete destruction of the entire world . George Maharis , ( Lee Barrett ) sets out to find out who has been able to break into their labs along with Dana Andrews , ( General Williams ) who also has a daughter Ann Williams , ( Anne Francis ) who gets into the middle of this story about germ warfare . Edward Asner , ( Veretti ) plays one of the bad guys in this film and gives a great supporting role . This film was a head of its times and it fits in greatly with the year 2007 and all the talk about Weapons of Mass Destruction .
416149	663392	86058	6.0	Revenge Gets You No Where	Great film with outstanding actors who made this film enjoyable to view and plenty of action which suddenly all starts to happen on a nice friendly weekend . Rutger Hauer , ( John Tanner ) , " Mentor " , ' 06 , portrays a TV Personality , something like a Spin Zone , which puts people in the public eye on the so called SPOT . John's wife is Meg Foster , " Coming Up Easy " , ' 04 who loves her husband very much and will even shoot bows and arrows for him , but she begins to have her doubts and at one point in the film decides to take their son and depart . John Hurt , ( Lawrence Fassett ) , " Shooting Dogs " , ' 05 , plays the role of a rather hateful character who seeks revenge for something his wife had to go through in her bedroom . Craig T . Nelson , ( Bernard Osterman ) , " The District " , ' 04 TV series , gives a great supporting role . It was nice to see Burt Lancaster make a few brief appearances in this film and I must say , Meg Foster has the most sexy looking eyes I have ever seen on a woman .
416999	663392	112864	7.0	Subway Car on the Platform	Greatly enjoyed this film which had the New York City Police going uptown and downtown and lots of action even in Wall Street , the financial section . There was a famous department store on Fifth Ave which had plenty of damage and also a very wild ride through Central Park with Jackson and Willis . Bruce Willis , ( John McClane ) , " Hostage " , ' 05 played a sort of washed up detective who loved his booze and had many hangovers through out the entire picture . Samuel L . Jackson , ( Zeus Carver ) , " The Man " , ' 05 gave an outstanding performance as a store owner in Harlem who managed to get roped into a big mess along with John McClane . Of course , I cannot forget that Jeremy Irons , ( Simon Gruber ) , " Casanova " , ' 05 , enjoyed playing a child's game named : " SIMON SAYS " and believe me this was not a game for kids in this film . Sit back and enjoy a great film and great actors all doing a fantastic job .
417318	663392	73756	7.0	Masterpiece of Martial Arts	This picture held my interest from the very beginning to the end with a film that is full of blood and gore . Sonny Chiba , ( Terry ) is hired to protect a young gal who has inherited a very large fortune and the the Asian mafia gets involved with trying to kidnap this rich young gal . There is eye-balls torn out , rape and drugs injected into a girl's veins in order to turn her into a full time prostitute . The martial arts was outstanding throughout the entire picture and Sonny Chiba put his entire heart and soul into this great 1974 film . I have never seen such a great film and was very glad I was able to obtain this film which I can enjoy over and over . Enjoy
416819	663392	56575	7.0	Entertaining Classic	Enjoyed this film which starts off with Cathy Timberlake , ( Doris Day ) standing on a corner in New York City while it is raining and she gets splashed by a limo driving through a puddle . The limo is owned by a very rich man named Phillip Shayne , ( Cary Grant ) and instead of stopping and assisting Cathy he drives off and realized he should have done something for this pretty blonde woman . Phillip Shayne looks out his widow and notices that this young woman is going into a auto-mat where you put in nickles and quarters for your food , so he sends his assistant Roger , ( Gig Young ) to offer her money to have a clothes cleaned . Eventually , Cathy and Phillip become friends with each other and she decides to go on a vacation with him in the tropics , even though they are not married and when it comes to going to bed , she has all kinds of fears and doubts about what she is doing . There are cameo shots of some very famous New York Yankee players and this is really a great 1962 Classic film .
417038	663392	26117	7.0	Classic Ann Harding Film	Ann Harding plays the role of Marion Forsythe who is an artist and looks absolutely beautiful in her role . Marion wears very little makeup and at times looks likes a ghost . Robert Montgomery , ( RIchard Kurt ) seeks out Marion and tries to get a biography of her along with many other men who have had relationships with her in the past . Edward Everett Horton , ( Leander Nolan ) claims to have been romantically involved with her and Edward Arnold , ( Mre . Feydak ) gives a great supporting role . There is plenty of funny scenes and lots of slapstick comedy which went along with most films from 1935 . This is truly a great film Classic of Ann Hareding who was a great film star along with all the other actors in this great film Classic . Enjoy .
417067	663392	281820	7.0	Entertaining Film	Nick Nolte , ( Bob Montagnet ) , " Neverwas " , ' 05 was perfect in this role as a gambler and thief all living in the fast lane of life , just like Nolte likes to do in his real life . Nutsa Kukhianidze , ( Anne ) " Mathilde " ' 04 played the role of a young girl 17 years of age , who was a hooker and met up with Bob who treated her like a father and daughter in an odd sort of way , but they did get along . However , Anne got all her loving from younger guys who seemed to come and go . There is great photography around all the casino's and there is plenty of scenic views through out the entire picture . Nutsa Kukhianidze is as skinny as a bean pole and does have a few nude scenes and does some very hot sexy dancing . This is really not one of Nick Holte's better films , but it is very entertaining and seems to drop dead at the END !
417970	663392	420609	7.0	Great Film	Liked the film , " In Cold Blood " which made Truman Capote a very wealthy man and also a famous celebrity who appeared on many TV shows and a few films . Toby Jones captured the entire film with his life like portrayal of the real Capote and made him come alive once again to tell a deeper and darker side to his childhood and true feelings towards one of the killers . This film also revealed the type of people that Truman Capote associated with in New York City high society and what a gossip he was among all the ladies and a few men . Sigourney Weaver , ( Babe Paley ) along with many other famous actors gave great supporting roles to this picture . However , this is truly a great masterpiece for Toby Jones who put his heart and soul into this role . Enjoy .
418070	663392	39313	7.0	Classic B Film	This Black and White film from the late 40's had a great deal of class and great acting . Steve Brodie , ( Steve Randall ) , " Frankenstein Island " , ' 81 , played a guy who had all the bad breaks and never seemed to be able to settle down with the gal or off spring and have a nice home in a small country town . Audrey Lang , ( Anne Randall ) , " Born to Kill " , ' 47 , was the wife of Steve Randall who did her best to help him make the right decisions and even got him to marry her . Steve and Ann Randall kept running away from a terrible threat made by Raymond Burr , ( Walt Radak ) , " San Quentin " , ' 46 , who was seeking revenge for the loss of a close family member . Jason Robards Sr . , ( Detective Lt . , Louie Ferrari ) , " Impact " , ' 49 , played the detective who was very interested in Steve Randall and hounded him where ever he traveled . There are some very tense scenes in which Walt Radak uses a clock to drive Steve Randall to a complete breaking point in his life . Great classic B film with a very young looking Raymond Burr and Jason Robards Sr . giving a great supporting role .
416654	663392	39244	7.0	Marsha Hunt Gave an Outstanding Performance	Enjoyed this film from the very beginning to the end with great artists performing in Carnegie Hall and a great story revolving around a woman named Nora Ryan , ( Marsha Hunt ) and her son named Tony Salerno , Jr . , ( William Prince ) who wants her son to become a great concert pianist . Nora works in Carnegie Hall as a cleaning lady polishing brass rails and works hard to support her son who she loves very much . Tony grows up in Carnegie Hall and gets to meet all the famous conductors , singers and famous musicians . However , Tony wants to cut the apron strings of his mother and branches off to the modern dance bands and meets up with a very attractive gal which sort of breaks his mother's heart . If you like Classical Music and enjoy the great talents of super star talents from the past , this is the film for you . By the way , Marsha Hunt is approaching the age of 90 years and contributed a great deal of her acting ability to the Hollywood Silver Screen . Great film , don't miss it . Enjoy .

417205	663392	60865	7.0	Many Twists & Turns to this Film	Enjoyed this film which starts off with a very neat robbery on the London Bridge , in England and then the picture takes you to a Circus Community that has lots of wild animals and very creepy people . Christopher Lee appears in the film but very briefly , their are plenty of lions , tigers , elephants and plenty of people with hidden paths and deep dark secrets . There is a constant battle between a guy and his attractive gal who teases him with a lot of flirting with other men . This film will completely keep you guessing just how the film will end because of the many twists and turns it takes you on . This film would really be a good Halloween film even though it does not have any horror , just suspense . Enjoy .
416934	663392	338526	7.0	Great Horror Film	Famous monster hunter , Van Helsing , ( Hugh Jackman ) is called to monster territory in Transylvania which involves him with the forces of darkness and death . There is plenty of sparks with special effects and even Frankenstein appears along with the Wolf man and plenty of Draculas killing their prey . Richard Roxburgh , ( Count Vladishaus Dracula ) gives an outstanding performance as the main blood sucker along with Shuler Hensley , ( Frankenstein Monster ) . Kate Beckinsale , ( Anna Velerious ) adds some female attraction along with a great cast of blood sucking monsters . This is a horror films which will keep you glued to your seats . Enjoy .
418114	663392	57197	7.0	Special Effects for 1963 were Great !	Missed this film and enjoyed the special effects which show huge rocks falling on both sides of a old time sailing vessel and a mythical creature appearing just at the correct time . There are a bunch of Skeltons that seem to appear when teeth are thrown on the ground . Todd Armstrong , ( Jason ) , " A Time for Killing " , ' 67 did a great job of fighting off his enemies and saving a beautiful gal from a sinking Greece ship who was Nancy Kovack , ( Medea ) , " Marooned " , ' 69 . Jason did not realize but Medea had a father who was very famous and powerful who did not particularly like Jason when he came face to face with Jason . Medea does come to Jason's aid when he gets into a bad situation . It is interesting as the film progresses and they try to find the Golden Fleece . Nice 1963 Classic , with great graphics .
416263	663392	94715	7.0	Midler & Hershey Were Great Together	Was not very certain if I really wanted to view this film , some times Midler can be way out in left field . However , in this film Bette Midler , ( CC Bloom ) , " That Old Feeling " , ' 97 plays a very self-centered person who will stop at nothing to get what she wants and if it is a career on the stage , just forget about love or a husband and children . Barbara Hershey , ( Hillary ) , " Riding the Bullet " , ' 04 , is a childhood friend of CC Bloom and in some ways they help each other , even though they are complete opposites . There is plenty of comedy , lots of fighting , and more drama than you can handle . Midler sings outstanding songs we all know by heart and it is a very entertaining film , but very very SAD !
416993	663392	29395	7.0	Great Harlow Comedy	Never viewed this Jean Harlow film where she stars as a widow with the name , Crystal Wetherby and Robert Taylor , ( Raymond Dabney ) . Robert Dabney just comes home to his family after being in prison for six months for breaking the law and his brother and father are not pleased to see him come back home . Robert's mother is the only one who is happy to see her son and she wants to protect her son . The Dabney Family deals with ladies underwear and the business is not doing very well and Robert's brother wants to marry Crystal Wetherby for her money in order to save his business and he does not want anyone to know he had a brother who went to prison . It just so happens that Crystal is also broke and owes a large sum of money and she is being hounded by the bill collectors . Raymond Dabney is hired by a sheriff to collect the funds owed him and requires that Raymond stay in Crystal's home until the debt is paid . Crystal decides to have Raymond pose as her butler , but does not realize that Raymond is a Dabney and his brother wants to marry her . There is plenty of comedy and Jean Harlow and Robert Taylor burn up the silver screen together .
416094	663392	335563	7.0	Holmes Met His Doom	This is a great film about Porno Star John Homes , played by Val Kilmar , " Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'05 , who gave a great performance portraying the Screw King of all time and how he eventually got screwed himself . Apparently , after John Holmes burned out , and got tired of measuring his 14 inch pride and joy , he went down into the horrible depths of drugs and more drugs . Lisa Kudrow , ( Sharon Holmes ) , " Marci X " , ' 03 gave a great supporting role as John's wife , who deep down really loved him , but John just used her like everyone else he came into contact . Christina Applegate " Tilt-A-Whirl " , ' 05 gave a good supporting role along with a few other stars like Carrie Fisher . The moral of this story is you will always " REAP WHAT YOU SOW " .
417213	663392	399365	7.0	Surfing & Love Triangle	This film is on location in Stavanger , Norway with outstanding photography on a rocky coast line with large cold waves and very young surfers who use short boards and really do not surf professionally . The film opens up with a marriage and a guy named Even , ( Vegar Hoel ) who was once married to this girl , Karen , ( Silje Salomonsen ) and is invited to be the best man and the sad part of this event is the fact that Even is still in love with Karen . The weather conditions in Norway for Winter surfing is below zero and water as cold as ice and not like California surfing conditions . This film keeps your interest from the very beginning to the end . Enjoy .
418163	663392	40665	7.0	Film Full of Great Actors	This is truly a great Musical Classic from 1948 with a cast of veteran actors and all at the height of their careers . Esther Williams , ( Rosalind Reynolds ) is a movie star who gives outstanding performances swimming gracefully with Richardo Montalban , ( Ricardo Montez ) and Peter Lawford , ( Lt . Lawrence Y . Kingslee ) who is a U . S . Navy technical adviser on the film who is suppose to fly a plane with Rosalind Reynolds hiding on the plane . Richardo Montez is in love with Rosalind Reynolds and expects to marry her after their filming of their movie . However , Lt . Kingslee met Rosalind a few years in the past and fell immediately in love with her and has every intention to marry her at all costs . Jimmy Durante , ( Jimmy Buckley ) along with Xavier Cugat and his orchestra gave great supporting roles to this great musical classic .
417190	663392	40597	7.0	Great 1948 Film	This was a very innocent sweet fantasy about a man who goes fishing and catches a rather different kind of under water creature , a Mermaid hook line and sinker . There is plenty of comedy , drama and romance . This man and son grew very fond of this Mermaid and this story will keep your interest from beginning to the very end . The ending is rather sad , but since this film is a sort of Fish story , nature had to take its course . There was quite a few other recent films about a Mermaid namely : " SPLASH " 1984 with Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah and also a very early version in 1931 and a TV showing of " Splash " 1994 . I am quite sure there will always be a story concerning a Mermaid in generation's to come . Enjoy
417194	663392	330793	7.0	Vengeance , Revenger & Plenty of Torture	John Travolta , ( Howard Saint ) played an entirely different role than I have ever seen him portray . He plays the role of a real underworld mob boss who loses his son and is bound and determined to find out just who is responsible for his loss . The guy he is looking for is Frank Castle / The Punisher ( Thomas Jane ) , Frank Castle was an FBI agent and had a very sweet and loving wife and also a young son who he rarely was able to spend time with because of his many assignments all over the globe . Frank decides he is going to retire and has a big party for a family reunion . It is from this point on in the film when things start to get real interesting and the film escalates into one big action filled film with all kinds of cruel hatred and murder after murder and beatings you will not be able to believe . This film had me glued to the TV Screen from beginning to the very end . If you have not seen this film , by all means get to see it soon .
416223	663392	66831	7.0	The Polish Prince was in this Film	This was a John Wayne film I greatly enjoy and was surprised at the wonderful old automobiles from the 1900's driving up and down every trail and even motorcycles . John Wayne played the role as Jacob McCandles who was looked up to as a man you did not mess with and respected . Maureen O'Hare , ( Martha McCandles ) seeks the help of her husband after years of being separated when their grandchild is kidnapped for a ransom for One Million Dollars . The gang of crooks is headed by Richard Boone , ( John Fain ) who will kill women and children in cold blood and think nothing of it . Patrick Waynes son has a role in this film along with the Polish Prince of Music and Song , Bobby Vinton . Maureen O'Hara had a very brief appearance only in the beginning and end of this film and this was also the last film that Wayne and O'Hara appeared together . Very entertaining film , you will not want to miss this great film Classic from 1971 .
417528	663392	48423	7.0	Great Cast of Actors	Enjoyed this 1955 film with great actors like Vince Edwards , ( Victor Gosset ) and John Cassavetes , ( Robert Batsford ) who were just starting their careers . In this picture Jack Kelly , ( Gene Courtier ) makes a very bad mistake and picks up a hitchhiker in the desert and Victor Gosset commanders his car and wants him to sell it for money and then meets up with Robert Batsford who is the boss of the kidnapping and then they decide to go to Gene Courtier home and hold his wife , Doris Courtier , ( Hildy Parks ) and two children hostage in their own home . Victor Gosset is crazy about women and can't seem to keep his hands off Doris Courtier and starts all kinds of problems with her husband . There is very high tension through out the entire picture and it was a great film for 1955 . Enjoy
416871	663392	36432	7.0	Gem of All Gems	This 1943 Classic film clearly showed how Hollywood supported our Armed Forces during World War II and there are so many talented actors appearing in this film who all gave great performances with their talented gifts . Always enjoyed the great singing talent of Lena Horne who appeared in many Musicals during the 1940's and one of her famous songs was " Stormy Weather " . I use to live in St . Albans , Queens , New York and she was a neighbor . Lena was the pioneer of Black entertainers who started to break into the Hollywood scene and finally it was accomplished . Naturally , the War was going on and this was a picture that was created to cheer our Fighting Men and it also was a propaganda film to cheer up the American Citizens with a cast of hundreds of famous actors . Enjoyed seeing a very little known actress who is now 91 years of age , Marsha Hunt who was very young and attractive in the film , she was only 26 years of age . Don't miss this film , it is really a gem of a gem . Enjoy
416846	663392	51845	7.0	Not Spencer's Greatest	This is a Classic John Ford Film dealing with old time politics in a small town , but hinting to be Boston , Mass . Spencer Tracy , ( Major Frank Skeffington ) , " Guess Who's Coming to Dinner " , plays the role of mayor who has been around for many elections and this is his final try at winning over his town . However , there are many changes starting to appear in the town and people are beginning to demand more improvements to their community . John Carradine , ( Amos Force ) , " Prison Ship " , runs the local paper in town and is not the best of friends with Frank Skeffington , however he hired Jeffrey Hunter as a reporter ( Adam Caulfield ) , " A Kiss Before Dying " , ' 56 , who is a nephew to the mayor . It seems everybody smokes up a storm and in one scene the room is filled with smoke floating all over the place . ( Glad those days are long gone ) The film has many classic actors , Donald Crisp , Basil Rathbone and many more actors who make this film a very entertaining film ; there is plenty of dry humor and drama , but entirely too draw out . I even noticed that Spencer Tracy used a great deal of cue cards , more than in any other film he appeared in . picture .
417818	663392	65126	8.0	Great John Wayne Classic	I can really understand why John Wayne , ( Marshall Roaster Coghorn ) won an Academy Award for his role in this great picture with great photography of the beautiful country of California . Glen Campbell , ( La Boeuf ) gave a great supporting role as a Texas bounty hunter looking for a man named Ned Pepper , ( Robert Duvall ) . There is also a very young girl named Mattie Ross , ( Kim Darby ) who finds Marshall Coghorn and hires him to capture the killer of her father and she is a very determined gal who will travel with Coghorn , Boeuf in order to capture these killers and crooks . Dennis Hooper ( Moon ) gave a great supporting role . This truly is one of John Wayne's great films and I am so glad he finally won an Oscar for his many years of making very entertaining films .
417993	663392	39417	8.0	Great Rossellini Film	Greatly enjoyed this film that was directed and written by Roberto Rossellini , which was produced on a very low budget with actual real life scenes of the complete destruction of Germany after World War II . Rossellini even hired just regular people to act in this film and very few professional actors . Edmund Moeschke , ( Edmund ) was a little boy who struggles trying to find food and lived with a family where an Ex-Nazi hid out and never went outside and never earned a living . Edmund sold stolen goods in order to obtain money and wandered among all the ruins of the Germany city with a bunch of very poor boys and girls . This is a rather depressing film and clearly shows the horrors that Hitler brought upon the German people who had promised a great country that would be world rulers . This is a great Classic film with its unbelievable photography and great acting .
416595	663392	264616	8.0	A Real Dark Spiritual Film	This film was completely different than any horror film I have experienced and in some ways it takes you deep into a twisted and sick mind which had a strict religious foundation . Many times we have heard killers say that the " Devil Made Me Do IT " ! In this picture God is speaking to Bill Paxton , ( Dad Meiks ) , who is trying to raise two boys , Matt L'Leary and Matthew McConaughey after there mothers untimely death . One of these boys walks into FBI Headquarters in their town and meets up with Powers Boothe , ( Agent Wesley Doyle ) , who listens to a story that completely makes no sense , but as the story unfolds , you begin to sense a very spiritual problem is causing all kinds of horrible things to happen to people from all walks of life , old and young . You just might not be able to watch this film from beginning to end , but just remember it is only a film , and the director and producer and actors all did a fantastic job . Enjoy if you CAN !
417353	663392	35799	8.0	Fantastic Classic 1943 Film	Have not seen this film in years and it was a great experience seeing this film and the great veteran actors who made this into a great WWII story . Cary Grant , ( Capt . Cassidy ) plays the commander who manages to take his submarine right into the backyard of the Japanese Nation . John Garfield , ( Wolf ) plays a great role who charms the crew with his tales of all the women he met along with a great deal of exaggeration . Alan Hale , ( Cookie Wainwright ) was a cook on the submarine and was able to give a great deal of comedy to his role as the chef . This film will keep you on the edge of your seat when the sub comes under fire from the Japanese Destroyer's while one of the crew is having surgery by a man who knows nothing about appendicitis . Dane Clark , ( Tin Can ) gave a great supporting role in this film and this film started a great career for Dane in Hollywood . Great film , don't miss it , you can see this film over and over .
416904	663392	87399	8.0	DOWN TO EARTH FILM AND VERY ENJOYABLE !	Taped this film years ago and thought it was just a great film about three ( 3 ) young gals striving to make a career in the dance field . It showed the hard work behind the scenes of the dancing world and gives encouragement for all those trying to follow in their footsteps . The location in Canada is depressing and the abandoned warehouse they decided to rent was unbelievable . There is lots of love and HOT romance along with a cute scene with a little boy asking a question about " Orgie's " and a very cute reply from his mother . This is a great classic film and very enjoyable to view , try to catch it on TV sometime !
417254	663392	22335	8.0	Dorothy MacKaill Was a Knockout in the 30's !	Enjoyed this great 1930's film and enjoyed the down to earth language and a true to life story with a very realistic ending ! Dorothy MacKaill ( Gilda Carlson ) , " Bulldog Drummond at Bay " , ' 37 , played a great role and was very sexy and teased all her gentlemen admires in her hotel on a island with horny old men ! Gilda was down and out and had many lovers , but fell in love with Donald Cook ( Carl Bergen ) , " Bowery to Broadway " , ' 44 , who was a naval officer who was always leaving her alone and at the mercy of lusting men . Gilda and Carl decided to take their marriage vows in a church by themselves because there was no minister to marry them . Gilda remained faithful to Carl , however , you will have to view this film in order to find out what happened to these Two Lover Birds !
416497	663392	39926	8.0	Overlooked Film	This is a film that is very much overlooked by most Bogart fans , not because of his acting , but the story line may have been great in 1947 , but is not very thrilling today . Humphrey Bogart , ( Geoffrey Carroll ) , " Dead End " , ' 37 , plays a struggling artist and also a man who loves the ladies . Barbara Stanwyk , ( Sally Morton Carroll ) , " Sorry , Wrong Number " , ' 48 plays the wife and begins to become very uncomfortable living with her husband . Geoffrey hands Sally a drink of milk before going to bed and she gets all upset and throws the milk out a stain glassed window . Alexis Smith , ( Cecily Latham ) , " The Eternal Sea " , ' 55 gets herself involved with Geoffrey and they have fun as told in the days of 1947 with no sleeping in bed together was allowed . Geoffrey works on a painting of his wife and has it under lock and key and eventually she opens the door and finds a great big surprise . Even Nigel Bruce ( Dr . Tuttle ) , " Dressed to Kill " , ' 46 appears in the picture and gives a great supporting role as the family doctor . If you are a Bogart fan , you will want to see his performance and especially his facial expressions , something like the " Caine Mutiny " 54 .
417927	663392	59825	8.0	Nice Black & White Film	Enjoyed the great direction of John Frankenheimer in this film which did not deal with hand to hand combat with the German Nazi's during WW II . The story is concerned with saving very expensive art paintings from being stolen by the German Army by railroad . Burt Lancaster plays the role of a French Station Master ( Paul Labiche ) and a German Colonel Von Waldheim ( Paul Scofield ) who fight against each other in order to accomplish their goals . Paul Labiche at first is not interested in what happens to these art treasurers and then understands the importance of not letting the German's steal these famous paintings . There is a very big struggle through out this film by Paul Labiche to stop this train and defeat the determined German Colonel . Burt Lancaster and Paul Scofield gave an outstanding performance in this 1964 Classic .
417152	663392	51879	8.0	A Richard Burton Masterpiece of Acting	This film reminded me of a film in which Richard Burton and Elizebeth Taylor both starred together in " Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf " , 1966 where there is nothing but a shouting and screaming husband and wife . This film has a rating and raving husband , Richard Burton , ( Jimmy Porter ) who plays a hot jazz trumpet and also sells sweets on a peddler's cart in the London streets of a small town . Mary Ure , ( Alison Porter ) plays the wife to Jimmy Porter and is a very abused wife who never fights back or even slaps his face when he abuses her endlessly , day in and day out . Claire Bloom , ( Helena Charles ) , is a good friend of Alison and also an actress who decides to live with the Porters for a few weeks as she is an actress in a play performing in the town . When Jimmy Porter and Alison Porter are not arguing or fighting , they call each other nicknames , a Bear and a Squirrel who cuddle next to each other and pretend to eat nuts . This is a very depressing film , however , Richard Burton gave a magnificent performance through out the entire film .
418030	663392	316654	10.0	Great Spider-Man Film	Tobey Maguire , ( Spider-Man / Peter Parker ) , gave an outstanding performance as a very weak and helpless type of guy who tried to fly like a bird and fell on his face all the time , so to speak . As the picture progresses you wonder just how Spider Man will eventually put an end to his octopus friend and his evil deeds . There are many exciting scenes and especially when Spider Man is trying to save a run-away elevated train from going off its track and winding up in a river . Kirsten Dunst , ( Mary Jane Watson ) is about to get married to someone other than Peter Parker and something takes hold of her and sends her in another direction . This was a great entertaining film and very well viewing over and over again .
416889	663392	43959	10.0	Susan Hayward & Tyrone Power Had Their Hands Full	Always enjoyed greatly the films which Tyrone Power and Susan Hayward appear in , they were great actors and put their hearts and souls into any role they had to play . In this picture Tyrone Power , ( Tom Owens ) , " Blood & Sand " , ' 41 , managed an outpost for stagecoaches and travelers . Tom met up with Susan Hayward ( Vinnie Holt ) , " I'll Cry Tomorrow " , ' 55 , and her little daughter and had some very unwelcome visitors who caused all kinds of problems and forced Tom & Vinnie to turn their entire lives upside down along with the little child who could hardly walk , but kept them on their toes . Jack Elam , ( Tevis ) , " Hannie Caulder " , ' 71 , played a very over sexed animal of a man who could hardly control his feelings for any woman . This picture keeps your interest to the very end and is a great Western Classic .
416035	663392	112795	10.0	George Hamilton & Lisa Rinna Were Great !	Lifetime shows some great TV films if you are interested in some romance and drama , this particular film held my interest because of the great acting and kept me guessing just how the story would end . George Hamilton , ( Malcolm Patterson ) , " Off Key " , ' 01 , performed great acting abilities as a very rich young man who was married a few times and never seemed to be able to have a son . Malcolm hires Lisa Rinna , ( Marielle ) , " Robot Wars " , ' 93 , who was looking for employment and was referred to Malcolm by her father who knew him over the years . Lisa Rinna gave a great performance and was very sexy and attractive along with the handsome tanned George Hamilton . Give it a look sometime and see if you can guess how film will END !
416737	663392	38988	10.0	LIZABETH SCOTT STEALS SCENES !	Van Helfin and Lizabeth Scott were like a magical couple , lots of romance and steamy scenes which stole the show from the other actors . Kirk Douglas was making his first film debut and was hardly noticed , he was always drunk and over acted throughout the entire picture . Lizabeth Scott was never given great roles to star in and therefore never could have fullfilled her great acting talents . Her films will always have a class all by themselves .
417491	663392	39320	10.0	KARLOFF IS REALLY GRUESOME !	Yes , this was a B picture in the late 40's and actors still had to make a living and ( Boris Karloff ) as Gruesome was the best selection by director John Rawlins . It seems a mysterious gas which temporarily paralyzes people falls into the possession of a disreputable doctor , L . E . Thal ( Edward Ashley ) . Realizing the great criminal opportunities of the strange gas , Gruesome , an ex-convict , enlists Thal's aid in a bank robbery . " Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome " is a thriller-diller only because Boris Karloff is the star performer . The picture has Karloff putting his victims in a huge furnace for safekeeping . Chester Gould , the creator of the comic-strip was proud of this picture in 1947 .
416293	663392	12938	10.0	Great Look Back in the Past	Viewing this Classic film from the 1920's was fascinating and especially viewing Gloria Swanson and Rudolph Valentino both in the same picture was very unusual in films during the Silent Era . Rudolph Valentino was the heart throb of all the young girls and ladies and Gloria Swanson was very petite and cute looking and had a certain spark to her acting skills . Rudolph Valentino , ( Lord Bracondale ) , played the playboy which he was in real life and gave an outstanding performance trying to win the heart and soul of Gloria Swanson , ( Theodora Fitzgerald ) . Theodora was married to an old man with a beer barrel belly and very rich , but he did deeply love Theodora and would do anything to make her very happy . This is a rare picture that was lost and restored in the Netherlands . If you like Classic Silent films and great film stars , this is the film for you .
416109	663392	206314	10.0	Very Entertaining FILM ! !	Was unable to leave my chair when I viewed this film and was greatly entertained by Steve Zahn , ( Fuller Thomas ) , " Speak " , ' 04 , who gave a great performance along with his calmer brother , Paul Walker , ( Lewis Thomas ) , " Timeline " , ' 03 , who had a very charming and sexy girl acquaintance , Leelee Sobieski ( Venna ) , " Uprising " , ' 03 , who was a college student he was going to pick up and drive home . Fuller has to make a side trip in order to get his brother out of jail and then the plot begins to go wild . There is a weird truck driver they talk to on their CB and then Fuller and Lewis decided to tease this driver and all Hell breaks loose . This film will keep you on the edge of your seat in more ways than one . There is even bare male butts running around a gas station and food establishment . Leelee Sobieski was very pretty and looked a great deal like actress Helen Hunt . Enjoy ! !
417059	663392	105291	10.0	The Best Ruby Story !	When I first watched the real Jack Ruby kill Oswald on the TV screen , we all felt like Jack was a hero and this picture came very close in telling the actual truth about what really went on in the White House , in Cuba , and all the so called HOODS involved . Danny Aiello , ( Jack Ruby ) , " Mambo Cafe " , 2000 , was the perfect choice to play the way Jack Ruby really looked and acted , I am sure Danny Aiello did a great deal of homework studying Ruby's characteristics . Sherilyn Fenn , ( Candy Cane ) , " Lonelife " , ' 97 , put a big sparkle into the film with her sexy figure , she looked just like M . Monroe ! Veteran actor Marc Lawrence , ( Santos Alicante ) who has performed in 178 films playing mostly gangsters and real bad guys gave a great supporting role . In my estimation , this is a great film about JACK RUBY !
417125	663392	35753	10.0	Famous French Classic Film	This film was produced while the Nazi's occupied France in 1943 and was financed by the Germans . After the war with Germany , France was very upset with the film and would not allow it to be shown . However , as we know today , it has become a great French film classic and has many awards . This film was considered a mystery thriller , with a person writing poison pen letters under the name Le Corbeau ( English Translation : The Raven ) Most of these poison pen letters were written to all the towns people and told of many dark secrets they were hiding . One person was in a hospital which was numbered # 13 and wanted desperately to change his bed because it was bad luck . All kinds of problems resulted from these letters signed by the Raven and before you know it , this story becomes a mystery that seems to never end . Great film to view and enjoy , try to view it some time on late time TV .
416399	663392	53017	10.0	Fantastic Montgomery Clift Film !	Have not seen this film in many years and was able to view it on late late late night TV . Montgomery Clift , ( Adam White ) , " Wild River " , ' 60 gave forth a deep power from within his very soul and cried out through out the entire picture as a frustrated writer in his love relations and the conflict with his own father . Adam encounters a woman who seeks his help through a column in the local newspaper and she complains about her husband's performance in bed after so many years and then all things break loose . Robert Ryan , ( William Shrike ) , " The Outfit " , ' 74 is a very bitter man who heads the newspaper and is constantly beating down his wife , Myrna Loy , ( Florence Shrike ) , " Song of the Thin Man " , ' 47 for having an affair with a man ten years in the past . Maureen Stampleton , ( Fay Doyle ) , " Cocoon " , ' 85 gave a great supporting role and spins a close web around Adam . Montgomery Clift showed a great deal of physical and mental pain in this film , but it seemed to make his performance a MASTER PIECE of great acting for all generations to view .
416283	663392	39437	10.0	About Love & Hate and the Slip of the Pen	Have not viewed this film in years and was completely surprised at almost everything in the entire film . It starts out rather slow , a bit boring and all of a sudden everything seems to happen . Lana Turner , ( Marianne Patourel ) , " The Bad & The Beautiful " , ' 52 , gave one of her greatest performances with a very dramatic acting role along with Van Heflin ( Timothy Haslam ) , " Tap Roots " , ' 46 who could not help but follow Marianne's business advice and also gave in to all her demands . Donna Reed , ( Marguerite Patourel ) , " The Last Time I Saw Paris " , ' 54 , played a woman who was deeply in love through out the entire picture and became very frustrated . Donna Reed gave an outstanding performance and could bring tears to your eyes . Edmund Gwenn ( Octavius Patourel ) , " Miracle on 34th St . " , ' 47 was the father to the two sisters and revealed great secrets as the film progressed . Frank Morgan , ( Dr . Edmund Ozanne ) , " The Wizard of Oz " , ' 39 , played a great supporting role as a heavy drinking doctor who greatly loved his son . I noticed Linda Christian , ( Hin Moa ) , " Thunderstorm " , ' 56 playing a brief role in this film , Linda Christian was the former wife of Tyrone Power . This is a masterpiece of a Classic Film which even had great pictures of Old Clipper Ships with their majestic Sails . Don't miss this Picture .
418064	663392	338556	10.0	Lots of Hot Love Making	This TV film was great , it had lots of romance , mystery and the story kept me guessing right to the very end . Angie Everhart , ( Lana ) , " Bare Witness " , ' 02 , married a very very rich older man and kept him very busy in bed much to his delight . However , the rich man's son returns from Harvard and accidentally walks into her bathroom while she is in her birth day suit and from then on , sparks seem to fly and the plot takes off in more ways than one . Andrew W . Walker , ( Holden ) , " The Secret Pact " , ' 99 , is the rich man's son and after staying around the mansion for a while and getting to really know his father , he finds out his father has some very horrible and mysterious hang ups . You will find this film very hard to figure out and it is a very well produced film to enjoy .
416241	663392	87235	10.0	Great TV CLASSIC !	Taped this TV film in 1984 and just recently viewed this film again and greatly enjoyed the talents of veteran actors like , Stefanie Powers , ( Jessie Callaway ) , " Invisible Strangler " , ' 76 , who showed her great acting abilities as a complicated young woman who has many mental problems and tries to help her mother move out of her home where she lived for forty ( 40 ) years . Melissa Gilbert , ( Sara Callaway ) , " Ice House " , ' 89 , does not get along very well with her mother and simply loves her grandmother , Maureen Stapleton , ( Maggie Lukauer ) , " Living & Dining " , ' 03 , who tries to help her daughter and granddaughter get over many of their problems which seem to pop up all over the house . There are some deep Family Secrets which finally come to everyones attention . If you like good acting and a great TV film , you just might be able to view this film on LIFETIME !
418126	663392	78446	10.0	Great Classic Film	Viewed this film years ago and never forgot the great acting and comedy scenes between Cheech Marin , ( Pedro ) and Tommy Chang , ( Anthony ) . Anthony is a rich kid who simply will not go to work or conform to anything his parents want him to accomplish in life . His dad tells him to get a job or else he is on his very own . Cheech manages to pick Anthony up along a highway and is even carrying his complete set of drums . There is one scene when a gal drives me crazy with laughter , when she sniffs up AJAX like the real Stuff and makes wild faces and tongue expressions you have never seen before . This is a film you need to see over and over again , it is great entertainment and a true Hollywood Classic .
416392	663392	117802	10.0	Girl Problems	Enjoyed this very down to earth film about a bunch of guys who are all looking for something special in the gals they meet and the boredom of the routine dating system everyone goes through in order to find a lasting relationship . This one guy goes with a gal for six years and then all of a sudden they drift a part yet the guy never stops thinking about her even though he meets other women and nothing seems to compare to this relationship . For some reason , this guy never seems to realize that he is deeply in love with this gal and needs to made her number one on his list of dates or better yet a simple phone call . Lots of comedy , drama and fantastic acting by all the actors .
417777	663392	25878	10.0	Great Classic Film	The film producers of this Thin Man Film never realized this first film starring William Powell , ( Nick Charles ) and Myrna Loy , ( Nora Charles ) would be such a great success and would go on and have six other Thin Man series . Nick & Nora Charles are newlyweds very much in love and are going to San Francisco for a honeymoon train ride . However , Nick is a detective and gets himself in a murder investigation in New York City and works with the police to solve a very mysterious story with murders and plenty of twists and turns right to the very end . This film is very fast paced and has lots of comedy with a fox terrier who steals lots of the scenes from the actors . Cesar Romero makes a brief appearance in this film along with Maureen O'Sullivan , ( Dorothy Wynant ) who was the wife of John Farrow a producer and was the mother of Mia Farrow . In my opinion this is the best of the Thin Man Films , and William Powell and Myrna Loy had a great magic with their performance as husband and wife . Enjoy .
416062	663392	43014	10.0	One of Billy Wilder's Greatest films !	The first time I viewed this film in 1950 , I was spellbound , even though it was in black and white , just seeing a man floating in a swimming pool face down in a dead man's float , had me wondering just where this picture was going to take me . William Holden ( Joe Gillis ) " Picnic " ' 55 I had seen before in other films . Gloria Swanson ( Norma Desmond ) " Airport " ' 75 kept me wondering why she was so attracted to Joe Gillis , who could have been her grandson in this picture . After seeing Erich von Stroheim ( Max von Mayerling ) " The Mask of Dijon " ' 46 who gave a very strange performance as a butler , housekeeper and who was madly in love with Norma Desmond along with acting like a Nazi and her personal film director . I just wondered how the story was going to turn out in the end . Billy Wilder brought back to the screen in 1950 , great Silent film stars with Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim who was an assistant director to D . W . Griffith , " Birth of a Nation " . Gloria Swanson was a famous actress and after this film , her career took off once again , with Films , Television and many business ventures . When Billy Wilder made pictures , they all became great CLASSICS for all generations to view and enjoy .
416284	663392	47365	10.0	Robert Wagner wore BANGS in this Film	Have not seen this film in years and enjoyed viewing the youth of all the veteran actors . James Mason , ( Sir Brack ) , " Lolita " , ' 62 , played an outstanding role , who did some very fancy sword swinging among King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table . Robert Wagner , ( Prince Valiant ) , " Banning " , ' 67 , had great interests with the Vikings and England's King Arthur . Prince Valiant wore bangs as a very young inexperienced man striving to solve some problems his family were placed in and had a difficult time in carrying out this mission . Janet Leigh , ( Princes Aleta ) , " Houdini " , ' 53 , looks very young and is attractive to both Prince Valiant and Sir Garwin . Sir Garwin is played by Sterling Hayden , " Crime of Passion " , ' who takes Prince Valiant under his supervision and plays a great supporting role through out the picture . There is great scenery at an old Castle in Scotland , which adds greatly to the production of this great Classic film from the 50's . Enjoy .
417679	663392	278504	10.0	The Truth is the Only Way to Solve a Problem	Whenever Al Pacino appears in a film you can just bet the film is going to be a complete knock out punch for the viewers . In this picture , Al Pacino ( Detective Will Dormer , ) , " Any Given Sunday " , ' 99 , plays a very successful cop who has a very keen sense in a crime situation and can almost smell the criminal . When Det . Dormer questions a suspect he looks right through them and his questions turn them into pure Butter . Hilary Swank , ( Det . Ellie Burr ) , " The Core " , ' 03 , simply had the hots for Will Dormer and adored his great history of solving crimes over the many years . Robin Williams , ( Walter Finch ) , " One Hour Photo " , ' 02 , gave an outstanding supporting role , who played a real weird character who wanted to work out a deal with Will Dormer to solve his problems and Will's . The moral to this story is that the Truth is the only path to follow in any situation in LIFE .
417050	663392	265459	10.0	Lots of Picture Taking	Some how I seemed to have missed this picture and was amazed at the great acting of Robin Williams as a photo clerk who took his job very serious and envied a local family , especially the young attractive mom , Connie Nielsen , ( Nina Yorkin ) , " Return to Sender " , ' 04 , who enjoyed all the comforts of home and some what neglected her husband in the bedroom . Robin Williams , ( Sy Parrish ) , " The Final Cut " , ' 04 , put his heart and soul into every picture that he developed and had a very very large Album of his own at home . Sy Parrish had a very dark dark mental problem from his youth and it seemed to give him problems as he became very close to the Yorkin family and their son . If you like Robin Williams talent , this is definitely an entirely different role he had to perform in .
416312	663392	90203	10.0	Page Finally Won an Oscar	Always have been a big fan of Geraldine Page and in this film Page played the role of an older woman , ( Mrs . Carrie Watts ) who lives with her son , Ludie Watts , ( John Heard ) and his wife , Jessie Mae , ( Carlin Glynor ) in a very small apartment in Houston , Texas . All these people do not get along very well because Carrie Watts wants to return to her old home in Bountiful , Texas which she misses so dearly . Ludie feels that his mother is not very well to travel by herself and live alone and does not want his mother to leave . Jessie Mae wants her mother-in-law to stay because she can use her social security check which Carrie tries to hind in order to make her escape . Carrie has tried many times to get away and you will have to view this film in order to see if Carrie ever does get away to her dream town of Bountiful , Texas .
416484	663392	109894	10.0	A MUST SEE FILM FOR MEN AND WOMEN !	This film kept my interest right to the very end and gave me lots of food for thought afterwards . Everything about this film is down to earth , just like everyday Life is . Rebecca DeMornay , ( Arlene Holsclaw ) starts out running away from prison through the woods with a child in her belly and hitchhikes to the nearest town . Lots of trouble starts in this town which you cannot even imagine . Arlie , ( which she hates to be called , perferring Arlene ) tries to live a normal life after being introduced to religion from ( Richard Jenkins ) Prison Chaplin . She is helped by a kind soul ( Carole Mitchell Leon ) Ruby , who sort of takes her under her wing and tries to get her a job as a dishwasher , however , Arlene perfers to sell her fantastic knitting art work . She runs into an old devil of a boyfriend ( Robert Knepper ) Carl , who tries to become her pimp and tells her to stop reading the Bible . Arlene is tricked out of her prision money to the tune of $500 . 00 and seems to wear the same old prison dress she was issued at the beginning of the picture . Your heart goes out to Arlene , she just cannot get things to work out for her and life deals her a very bad hand in everyway possible . Her mother , ( Ellen Burstyn ) is a heartless and evil mommie who gives her child away and watches her own flesh and blood be molested by a family member . This picture clearly depicts what mother's and father's can do to their children with physical and mental abuse . Arlene represents all the young girls who have gone through CHILD ABUSE and have never had a normal life since . It is a sad picture , but a picture that has a great deal of TRUTH and realism . Young men and Young woman should SPEAK OUT RIGHT AWAY ! whenever these people ( family or friends ) try to abuse you in anyway .
417908	663392	36046	10.0	Great Old Time Classic	In this picture we have a cast of veteran actors , namely : John Carradine , ( Mike Clancy ) known for his acting as a vampire with Boris Karloff and also Sidney Toler , ( Capt . Kruger ) who played the role as Charlie Chan in many 1940's serials . Then , Gale Sondergaard , ( Marge Wilson ) who appeared in many horror films and also with Basil Rathbone in Sherlock Holmes . In this picture the cast is all involved in trying to find 30 million dollars in gold on a sunken ship and believe it or not Sidney Toler plays the bad guy . If you like real old black and white films starring these actors , this is a film you will not want to miss viewing . Enjoy .
416236	663392	362001	10.0	Enjoyed the BOOK !	Greatly enjoyed John Grisham's great story about a warm and kind family in the South who had the hard task of picking Cotton for a living and never painting their home . All the actors did a fantastic job of portraying what a very hard life it was in 1952 trying to find Mexican help and poor White families to assist in the picking process . Grisham's book went into more detail and the picture sort of chopped up the entire story , especially the scene where Luke , a young boy takes a peek at a girl taking a swim in the nude . Luke also witnesses a murder and plays a funny trick on a Yankee Lady who has to use the OUT HOUSE ! Great film which makes you laugh and CRY !
416483	663392	124975	10.0	WE NEED MORE FILMS LIKE THIS ONE EVERY YEAR !	Hollywood for years portrayed drinking and smoking in all its films and continues to do the same thing in this century , making it look like a very important part of the social life for everyone , rich or poor , young or old . If you had a hard days work or wanted to have a ball , they showed famous actors and actresses having a martini and smoking in almost every scene . Drinking was an escape from the reality of having to face life and its many problems we all have to face . This picture about three ( 3 ) young gals looking for a good time , showing false ID's is an on going problem and does not end with this movie . ( it is done with High School & College Students ) Bonnie Root , who plays Lizzie Williams , enjoys drinking Vodka straight from the bottle , while other girls , Janie Palmer ( Marisa Rudiak ) and Kate Jenkins ( Deanna Milligan ) like to drink wine coolers or just plain beer . ( all of these are addictive ) As the movie progresses , each girl seems to drink occasionally and increases as time goes by , however , Lizzie seems to enjoy drinking more and more vodka . They are all very intelligent young ladies with straight A's , and have been told many times about the danger of drinking , however , they do not think it can happen to them , they really are not aware of the dangers of really drinking and its very addictive abilities to destroy your body and mind ( BRAIN CELLS ) . One of he girls was able to turn off their drinking habits with no withdrawal symptoms ( which is very hard to break , like smoking , but WORSE ! ) and went about their lives , however , Lizzie has an never ending fight with drinking . There really is no END to this movie so long as people DRINK & DRIVE and care nothing about their brothers and sisters in this world around them . The movie proved that you can really enjoy the natural JOYS of living without a DRINKING HIGH which vanishes the next day . Some of these girls thought that just drinking beer and wine was not as bad as hard booze , and found out it all leads them in the same direction . Having to drink everyday or on schedule , is a good sign you need HELP !
417836	663392	461660	10.0	Great Entertaining Film	Enjoyed viewing this picture from beginning to end and how two families growing grapes in Napa Valley could have such a strong love and hate relationship . The entire cast of actors gave outstanding performances and I thought that Patricia Heaton , ( Sara Rosa ) showed her real talents and even rode a horse around the vineyards . This engagement ring was given with great love and in a way , caused a great deal of hatred for many many years among these two families . There is lots of humor , drama and cute romance with husband and wife and some live together couples , getting to know each other . I really think this story of these two famines should be made into a TV series , or at least make up a TV program using most of these fantastic actors .
417415	663392	20534	10.0	Boris Karloff was a Lawyer in this Classic Film !	Just recently taped this great film Classic and enjoyed going back in time to 1929 and enjoying a picture directed by Lionel Barrymore for MGM . This black & white film with foggy scenes of London and a group of British former officers drinking scotch and soda and singing old tunes while their fellow comrades died like flies , kept you wondering who the killer really was . There was mention of the " Green Ghost through out the picture and it seems this film was originally called " The Green Ghost " . It was funny seeing painted words on the kitchen wall , " Waste NOT " WANT NOT " The big shocker was seeing Boris Karloff , " Bedlam " ' 46 , appear as a lawyer and reading the last will of their fellow officers . Karloff was grateful that Lionel Barrymore gave him an uncredited role in this film , which boosted his recognition on the silver screen . Roland Young ( Lord Montague ) " Topper " ' 37 gave a very comical and dramatic performance and would be considered very slap stick in this generation . Dorothy Sebastian ( Lady Efra Cavander ) former Ziegfeld Gal put some so called action into the film with her very close-cut hair style . Most films in the late 1920's are very hard to find , this is a gem that was great viewing and took me way back in time . Enjoy this film , if you can find it !
416320	663392	79100	10.0	Lots of Electricity Between Fonda & Redford	Over the years I seemed to have missed seeing this film and enjoyed the very young looking Jane Fonda and Robert Redford . The best part of the picture takes place when these two actors are in the outdoors and enjoying the so called comforts of a rough camping routine . Their first warm kiss gets the film interesting and their conversations become very comical and entertaining over sleeping habits and cold coffee . Jane Fonda played ( Alice ( Hallie ) Martin ) and Robert Redford was ( Norman ' Sonny ' Steele ) who made plenty of electricity in this cute romantic film . If you like great photography of the West and two outstanding great actors , this is a film to enjoy .
416829	663392	109642	10.0	Remarkable Performance by Kathy Bates	For some reason I missed seeing this picture in 1995 and was spellbound from the very beginning of the film to the end . Kathy Bates , ( Dolores Claiborne ) , " Bruno " , ' 2000 played a very down to earth woman who loved her daughter very much and did everything to make certain she had a good education and free from the conditions that prevailed in her home town . Jennifer Jason Leigh , ( Selena St . George ) , " In The Cut " , ' 03 , played the daughter who is a very successful reporter / writer living in New York City . Selena found out that her mother was in trouble back home and needed her help and it is about this time that the story starts to unfold and plenty of action starts happening . Judy Parfitt , ( Vera Donovan ) , " Ever After " , ' 98 , was a very wealthy woman who hired Dolores Claiborne to be her live in maid or so called , " SLAVE " . Christopher Plummer , ( Det . John Mackey ) , " Blizzard " , ' 03 , gives a great supporting role in trying to solve all the mystery that seems to surround the life of Dolores in her past and present day happenings . This story keeps you wondering just what happened in the past and how this film will end . Great entertainment and outstanding acting .
417456	663392	29222	10.0	Classic Musical Love Story	If you like old time pictures that portray simple down to earth innocent love and beautiful voices , this is the picture for you . Jeanette MacDonald , ( Marcia Mornay ) , " The Sun Comes Up " , ' 49 , always wanted to sing professionally and was tutored by John Barrymore , ( Nicolai ) , " Playmates " , ' 41 who was very much older than Marcia and helped her achieve great importance in the world of Opera . Nelson Eddy , ( Paul Allison ) , " Northwest Outpost " , ' 47 , was a young singer and was lazy about becoming a great singer and often frequented local bars and sang and drank with all his friends . The close ups of Jeanette MacDonald reveal her great beauty and wonderful acting skills besides a great talent for singing . This is a sweet and very sour picture about two people who fall deeply in love which enchanted all the audiences of 1937 and will continue for many generations to come .
416366	663392	75314	10.0	Great Story / Great Acting	Robert DeNiro , ( Travis Beckle ) plays the role of a Viet-Nam veteran who is trying to find himself in the wild city of New York and drives a Taxi for a living . Travis witnesses all kinds of crimes against society and how a young girl named Jodie Foster , ( Iris Steensma ) , is being used as a hooker and exploited by some very low life creatures . Travis becomes very committed to Iris and tries to straighten her life out . Travis decides he is going to do away with a certain politician and senator who is running for President . Cybill Shepherd , ( Betsy ) plays a great supporting role along with Peter Boyle , ( Wizard ) . Robert DeNiro is so very young looking , I had to look twice in order to recognize him ; there is lots of action , drama and some humor . Enjoy .
416192	663392	335345	10.0	God is Speaking to Us All !	After , America has been made aware how very short our lives are on this earth and the great struggle between the Powers of Evil vs . Good , which is a struggle everyone of us has to fight in our very souls daily . This film appears to many as a very cruel and horrible account of the way in which Jesus was murdered by an angry crowd of mainly political people in high places who thought that Jesus was a King and going to interfere with their comfortable way of life . The suffering in this picture that Jesus endured are also the many crosses we have to bear in life , War and loss of our dear ones to Cancer and events like . This film will awaken America to realize that we have a promise of life after death through the precious Body and Blood of Jesus that was shed for all people to have victory over Sin and Death and the promise of Eternal Life . The people killed Jesus and not any particular group , everyday we Kill Jesus with our unbelief and the lack of love for your neighbors . This is a great film , but not for young children to view , wait for them to understand the true meaning before you let them see the great gift Jesus gave US .
416939	663392	40577	10.0	Delightful 1948 Film	Enjoyed this great entertaining film with Glenn Ford , ( Doug Andrews ) who is looking for a job after being in the Army and goes to the personnel department of a large department store and meets the store personnel manager , Millie McGonigle , ( Evelyn Keyes ) . Millie interviews Doug and finds out he would like to be a floor walker in this department store . Doug notices that Millie is very concerned with a young boy she is fond of and wants to adopt , however , she needs a husband and so Doug tries to help her find a husband who likes children and is attracted to Millie . This is a very funny film with all kinds of funny situations between Evelyn Keyes and Glenn Ford . Evelyn Keyes had a nice role in " Gone With The Wind " and after this film Glenn Ford went on to make many great films which brought him to great fame on the silver screen . Enjoy .
418078	663392	191915	10.0	Daryl Hannah Gave a Great Performance !	Some how I missed this film and was very glad to have viewed it on TV . Daryl Hannah ( Anne ) , " Northfork " , ' 03 , appeared as a very happy and beautiful young lady who has her life changed completely over night and is presumed dead . Jennifer Tilly ( Helen ) , " Lil ' Pimp " , ' 04 , appeared as a woman who was mentally disturbed and did everything she could to make Anne comfortable and at times very Uncomfortable . Helen gave a great supporting role and her husband ( Vincent Gallo ) , Frank , " The Brown Bunny " , ' 03 , was a quack doctor and even tried to rape Anne ( Daryl Hannah ) . You never know just how this picture will ever end and if justice will ever be accomplished . This is a great film to view and offers great entertainment , ENJOY !
416235	663392	304636	10.0	Great Film about the Mentally ILL !	It seems that more and more we see and hear about people who act like Ted Bundy , who are serial killers and others who murder their wives and children . Bruce Greenwood , ( Robert Keppel ) , " The Republic of Love " , ' 03 , gave an outstanding performance having to deal with Ted Bundy and making the audience even think at times that he was going to follow down the same path as BUNDY himself ! Kathleen Quinlan , ( Sande Keppel ) , " Blessings TV , " ' 03 , was the wife of Robert Keppel who was going crazy with the effects that Ted Bundy was making on her husband's personality , as well as his children . This film is morbid and difficult to view , especially with the horrible torture of his victims and the needless waste of human LIFE !
416396	663392	48215	10.0	Great Classic Film in 1955 !	Greatly enjoyed viewing this film in the 1950's and all the audiences were thrilled at seeing this sea monster tackle the Golden Gate Bridge and terrify all the people in San Francisco . This film cannot compare to the films being made in 2000 , however , in 1955 it was a great B Film and is presently and always will be a great Classic . Kenneth Tobey , who was a submarine captain , " Body Shot " , ' 93 gave an outstanding performance along with Faith Domerque , " The House of Seven Corpses " , ' 74 who was a beautiful young actress and acted like a very strong willed woman who was hard to charm off her feet . Unfortunately , Faith had a short career due to her struggle with cancer . This is truly a great Classic Film of the 50's . Enjoy !
417492	663392	28773	10.0	HELL'S KITCHEN WAS ON THE WEST SIDE OF NYC / NOT THE EAST SIDE !	" DEAD END " was depicting the daily living conditions of people on the West Side of Manhattan , near the Hudson River , which was called Hell's Kitchen and was located on the lower section of the West Side . The East Side of NYC is where the Brooklyn Bridge is located near the East River across from the Borough of Brooklyn . The East Side Kids or The Bowery Boys were suppose to be jumping into the Hudson River for a swim off the docks . The City of New York with the help of former Mayor LaGuardia cleaned up the Hell's Kitchen section and many famous people have lived in this area , namely : John F . Kennedy , Jr . - - Humphrey Bogart and the Dead End Kids made this film into an all time classic film for many generations .
417394	663392	114559	10.0	Eric Close Gave a Great Performance	Gerald McRaney , ( Dave Morgan ) , " War Crimes " , ' 01 TV Series , was like a father to Tiffani Thiessen , ( Jennifer Gallagher ) , " A Kiss Before Lying " , ' 03 , who experience a very bad situation in her life and it caused Jennifer to be withdrawn with people and young men . Dave Morgan tries desperately to get her out of the house and manages to introduce Jennifer to Chris ( Gallagher ) who falls madly in love with her at their very first meeting . In almost one or two dates later , Chris asks Jennifer if she will marry him and she agrees . It is not very long after the Wedding that things start to happen , Chris is in the Navy and does not like working in submarines and things start happening to young gals in the neighborhood . This is a very excellent TV film and it sometimes makes you wonder if the guy or gal I want as a Soul Mate is the Perfect PERSON !
416037	663392	11000	10.0	GOOD VS . EVIL !	Decided to view this film because I wanted to see what other countries in Europe were watching in their movie houses in 1921 . The director , Carl Theodor Dreyer had a great talent and produced many interesting films through out his lifetime . This film showed how the devil down through the centuries was able to destroy peoples souls , including Judas in betraying Jesus to the Roman soldiers . There was a bargain that God had with the devil according to this story , where the devil would continue to remain on earth to fight for human souls and their destruction . All the actors performed with excellent skill for the Year 1921 and the fact that it was a silent film . It was very interesting to see the outdoor scenery in various countries and also observe the old furniture and customs . In one scene in Finland , the family who had young infants , seemed to keep them in a closet with a cloth curtain as a door and hung in a cradle held by straps ! If you get a chance to view this film , it is really worth the time .
