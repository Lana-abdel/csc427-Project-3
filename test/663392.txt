416812	663392	95382	1.0	Nice Try	Enjoyed viewing Louis Gossett , Jr . , ( Charles ' Chappy'Sinclair ) , " Window " , ' 05 , who started out in the film as a Full Bird Colonel and wound up a One Star General . Chappy received this high rank because he was drawn out of the National Guard to complete a mission with Russian forces and a crew of so called Misfits . There is plenty of comedy through out the entire picture and I really do not know if it was intended to be taken that way . Mark Humphrey , ( Capt . Matt Cooper ) , " JAG " , 03 TV Series " was a pilot who simply could not take any orders from anyone and held a vengeance toward the Russian forces he had to work with . However , he got the hots for Sharon Brandon , ( Valeri Zuyeniko ) a Russian Pilot who was the only gal in the crew and had the face of a Russian woman , and despite that fact , they were in LOVE . If you like Lou Gossett Jr . , then watch this film .
417419	663392	95389	1.0	GREAT ACTING BY SPADER & GIBB !	Jack the Ripper films are one of my favorite , however , this film was boring and very unrealistic . I simply could not wait until it finally ended and the real Jack the Ripper was finally revealed . However , I knew who Jack the Ripper was from the very beginning of the picture . James Spader ( John / Rick Westford ) " I Witness " ' 03 , gave a great dual performance and is a great up and coming actor along with Cynthia Gibb ( Chris Moscari ) " A Crime of Passion " ' 03 TV , who loved John Westford and became very close with Rick . These actors did a great job with a horrible script about nothing !
417121	663392	299556	1.0	Good Vs . Evil	This film is a mixture of horror , comedy , drama and many daring attempts by the original fallen angel to free all his followers in order to gain back the entire world from God . A pope is even capture by a wild looking he / she with way out color styles and remarkable abilities to fight off the forces of evil . There are some scenes which have comedy with plenty of off color punch lines along with swords and evil being outwitted by the pure virgins . The opening scene is when the evil angels break into a dwelling place for nuns and try to seduce them and obtain their blood . I almost forgot , there is vampires and even people changing themselves into bats . Not too impressed with this film , you can do better watching another film .
416273	663392	295427	1.0	WOW What a Film !	Decided to view this film simple because of the title and I was probably thinking about Lon Chaney and his many faces of Horror . Well , this film was a horrible mess and a big Horror to watch . I will have to say that Dana Carvey , ( Pistachio Disguisey ) , " The Shot " , ' 96 did a great job of acting crazy and I am sure it was not easy to follow the script . Jennifer Esposito , ( Jennifer Baker ) , " Crash " , ' 04 , was rather cute and very attractive and gave a good supporting role . Last but not least , James Brolin , ( Fabbrizio Disguisey ) , " A Guy Thing " , ' 03 , added his talents to this picture , but I began to wonder if Barbra Streisand enjoyed this film and her husband's performance . WOW
417972	663392	36307	1.0	Horrible B Film	Always enjoy the Classic Horror films , however , this film was really a big waste of time and if it were not for John Carradine playing the mad man doctor who is able to control human beings through his experiments . This film was made during WW II and John Carradine was a German Nazi working to find a human weapon against the entire world . Bob Steele playing in many roles as a cowboy or gangster and in this picture Bob seemed bored to death with his role in this film and acted like this was his first film . Mantan Moreland , ( Jeff ) gave an outstanding performance with great comedy which helped keep the audience attention . I hate to criticize a film made in 1943 , but this is really a big disappointment . If you like John Carradine and the roles he played as Count Dracula throughout many films during the 1940's , you just might like to watch John doing his best .
416206	663392	102187	1.0	Entertaining Film	This was a great martial arts film starring John Travis , ( Ronald L . Marchini ) who finds himself living in the world as the last cop on earth . John has a hat that reads : " Special Cop " who runs into all kinds of horrible looking men and women who want to kill the last cop on earth . John Travis meets up with a woman named Rachel , ( Carrie Chambers ) who is badly beaten up , Rachel tries to protect all the children in the various surrounding cities and they call them Free-Bees and she offers them a nice shelter to live in .

However , Rachel has a broken crystal which enables her to transport human beings into other places . Rachel asks John Travis to assist her in obtaining this crystal which she tells John he should have no problems in trying to secure this new crystal , which turns out to be very false statement to John . There is plenty of action in the B film with horrible acting , but lots of fun to just watch and enjoy .
417403	663392	110178	1.0	Entertaining Film	This film is about a 17 year old named Kyle Bradley , ( Renee Humphrey ) who goes to the big city to find her half sister Merci who is a singer and she has the police after her for getting involved in a murder .

416967	663392	311429	5.0	Horror Characters from the Past	If you are a film buff who loves mysteries and horror stories , this is the film for you . You have Captain Nemo , The Invisible Man , Dorian Gray , Dr . Jekyll and a hot to trot Vampire Mina Harker . There is a real bad dude who is starting all kinds of trouble and goes around looking like a monster wearing a mask of silver and Sean Connery , ( Allan Quatermain ) , and all the other characters mentioned above take part in this adventure . Dorian Gray and Peta Wilson , ( Mina Harker ) , " Mercy " , 2000 , were hot lovers years ago and they make wild love together ; Dorian Gray cutting up his love and Mina sucking him to death , with blood dripping down her lips . This is not the greatest of films and rather long and boring at times , but it was still enjoyable to watch Sean Connery do his thing and try to control this gathering of Horrible creatures .
417532	663392	49013	5.0	A Family of Horror Actors	Basil Rathbone , ( Sir Joel Cadman ) played a different role in this picture and was not the clever detective Sherlock Holmes . Sir Joel Cadman was a doctor who specialized in the brain of human beings and needed the assistance of Dr . Gordan Ramsay , ( Herbert Rudley ) who was going to be hanged for killing someone . However , Sir Joel had a special drug which will make a person look dead and still be very much alive , so he administered the drug to Dr . Ramsay and he was able to escape being hanged . Sir Joel needed Dr . Ramsy who is a very famous brain surgeon and is much needed in his experiments . Odo the Gypsy , ( Akim Tominoff ) played a very funny role as a body snatcher for Sir Joel and the human people had to be alive and kicking in order for him to operate on their brain . Bela Lugosi , ( Cosmir ) played the role as a servant who could not speak and was as quiet as a church mouse and never killed anyone for a change . Some of Sir Joel patients consisted of Lon Chaney , Jr . , ( Mungo , Dr . Munroe ) and John Carrandine , ( Bohemund ) who all seemed to have some mental and physical defect . If you like all these Horror Actors from 1956 , you will definitely want to see this film in Black & White .
417496	663392	105104	6.0	A Wesley Snipes Classic Film	Always enjoy the fantastic talent of Wesley Snipes , ( John Cutter ) , " Blade Trinity " , ' 04 , who gives an outstanding performance with his hand-to-hand combat action scenes and comical comments . There is a bit of friction between John Cutter and a hot sexy airline stewardess and the gals just seem to burst with joy at just looking at him . Bruce Payne , ( Charles Rane ) , " One Point O " , played a nut case of a bad guy in this film and had fun with a small boy on the airplane playing shoot'em Up with their fingers , until the little boy noticed he had handcuffs on his wrists . There was plenty of action and one of Wesley Snipes great Classic films Enjoy .
417782	663392	294594	6.0	Excellent Horror Film	This horror film deals with a church that is buried beneath the earth and it has a scene which depicts Jesus Christ being hung on a cross and their is a large crowd of people who just simply watch and do nothing to try to prevent this murder . Cassie Grant , ( Christina Ricci ) who is driving her car and runs into a young girl named Marion Kirkman , ( Kerry Fox ) and Cassie takes care of Marion who has amnesia and cannot remember just who she is . As the film progresses , Marion begins to see many people in the local town who just stare at her and she becomes very close friends with Cassie Grant's children and begins to see that these children are in grave danger from these people who just wander all around and simply just staring and watching every move that they make . There is a deep meaning to this film and it is not just an ordinary horror film but deals with a religious Bible story .
416837	663392	186894	6.0	Paltrow & Affleck were Great	Enjoy the acting of Gwyneth Paltrow , ( Abby Janello ) who plays the role of a woman who lost her husband in a plane crash and is struggling with her love for him and the big hole it has left in her heart . She tries to establish herself in a business with the help of her mother in order to support her two young children .

Buddy Amaral has had a drinking problem and went into rehabilitation , however he was haunted by a horrible thing he caused Abby Janello and followed his 12 Step Program in AA to make amends to any person you hurt while you had been drinking .

416945	663392	56940	6.0	Classic Film Comedy	If you like Frank Sinatra and remember some of these old time actors , and some very talented ones , this would be a good film for you to watch and enjoy . The story evolves around a New York Jewish Family who all try to create some nice Jewish accents , except Frank Sinatra , who does not even make the attempt . Lee J . Cobb , ( Harry Baker ) , is the father to Alan Baker , ( Sinatra ) and calls his son a BUM and a do nothing Playboy , ( which he really is in this film ) Molly Picon , ( Sophie ) , is the mother to the Baker family and gets upset with having to answer the many telephone calls she has to answer in her son's apartment . Barbara Rush ( Connie ) is very attractive and has a great romantic interest in Alan Baker along with many other hot chicks . Even Dan Blocker , ( Eckman ) " Gunsmoke " TV Series , finds time to give Alan Baker a right upper hook to the jaw . Nice 1963 film with even Frank Sinatra singing a few musical tunes I did not recognize .
416508	663392	435653	6.0	Don't Dance on Graves Ever	This is a very exciting Horror , Thriller film which deals with a group of friends named Harris McKay , ( Dominic Purcell ) and Allison Mitchell , ( Clare Kramer ) .

416424	663392	30079	6.0	Great 1938 Drama School Film	Always enjoyed the acting of Paulett Goddard who plays the role of ( Nana ) a young girl who is attending a Drama School in Paris , France along with Lana Turner , ( Mado ) who are striving to become actresses and have only one desire in their lives . Luise Reiner , ( Louise Mauban ) is a poor gal who attends the Dramatic School in the daytime and is forced to also work in a factory making gas meters .

Great 1938 film with lots of laughs and plenty of dramatic acting . Enjoy .
417703	663392	47575	6.0	The Army Had Bad Doctors	This film starts out with a Calvary Army Officer being shot in the leg by a Native American Indian and is treated by an Army Doctor who is bombed out of his mind on booze and tries to operate on his leg and cuts an artery and the soldier dies .

416020	663392	117777	6.0	Turturro Gave a Great Performance	Remember when the McGuire Sisters were at the top of their careers and everyone was dreamy eyed at the fact they had wonderful voices on the Ed Sullivan TV Show and also their father was a Preacher . When the facts finally came out about Phyllis McGuire getting involved with a top notch gangster from Las Vegas , WOW it was the Shock of the Century in those days . John Turturro , ( Sam Giancana ) , " She Hate Me " , ' 04 , played the role of Sam to perfection and when he met Phyllis McGuire's parents , he made a complete Ass of himself and it was quite funny . Mary-Louise Parker , ( Phyllis McGuire ) , " Romance & Cigarettes " , ' 05 , gave a great supporting role and had some real funny scenes in a motel room with their sleeping arrangements and final love making . It sure is a nice entertaining film if you happened to miss seeing it .
417188	663392	113501	6.0	Great Acting / Great Entertainment	Always enjoy the great acting of Laurence Fishburne , ( Sheriff Tanny Brown ) who becomes very upset when a professor visits his town to investigate a sort of Cold Case . This professor is a retired lawyer named Paul Armstrong , ( Sean Connery ) who has reason to believe that a man on death row is innocent of rape and murder of a very pretty little white girl .

There are many twists and turns to this story and plenty of action and very creepy areas in the swamps of Florida . This film will keep you glued to your screens if you have not seen this film before . Enjoy
416929	663392	109951	6.0	Great Entertaining Film	Nicolas Cage , ( Doug Chesnic ) plays the role of a Secret Service Agent and is assigned to protecting a former First Lady , Tess Carlisle , ( Shirley MacLaine ) who is a very difficult First Lady to protect and is stubborn about who protects her and she simply does not like Doug Cbesnic but for some reason considers him like her son . Tess's son has nothing to do with his mother and Tess seems to take things out on her Secret Agent Doug , treating him like her son . No one seems to be able to please Tess and there are plenty of comedy and great chemistry that exists between Nicolas Cage and Shirley MacLaine and this makes the film a great success . Enjoy .
416370	663392	60121	6.0	Sophia Loren was so Beautiful	Gregory Peck , ( Professor David Pollack ) , " Old Gringo " , plays a professor who is kidnapped for a brief period and is told to reveal the secrets of an Arabic writing which is his specialty . He is shot at , hit on the head and thrown out of a truck and meets up with Sophia Loren , ( Yasmin Azir ) , " The Black Orchid " , who runs into him all the time and decides to help him escape from his captives . However , Yasmin tells so many lies that David does not believe her and begins to think she is working against him . There is plenty of comedy , drama , romance and action . This is not exactly an easy film to just sit back and relax , it keeps you wondering just what is really Going ON
417035	663392	44547	6.0	A Real Gem of a Film	This is a Gene Kelly film which I had never viewed and only associated Kelly as a song and dance actor in many musicals . Kelly plays the role as Capt . Jeff Eliot who visits the Lehrt family in Germany who protected him and his plane during WW II . However , he finds out that the family was killed and the only member in the family remaining was Wilhelmina Lehrt , ( Pier Angeli ) . Jeff Eliot finds Willie working in a nightclub and they seem to fall in love with each other , until Jeff finds out some very dark secrets Wilhelmina had been keeping from him and they have a fight between the two of them . Claus Clausen , ( Heisemann ) plays the role of a Nazi Commander during the Neo-Nazism Post WW II and has complete control over an underground movement that wants to continue the Hitler movement in Germany . There are really outstanding photography inside Adolph Hitler's Berchtesgard Eagles Nest , which is all bombed out and you see Heisemann standing in front of the large window in Berchtesgard . There is plenty of suspense and good supporting actors like Richard Egan , ( Lt . Parker ) and even some romance . Enjoy
417739	663392	75260	6.0	Jack Palance Needed Work	Enjoyed this Italian Film , which had comedy , drama and plenty of gang-buster shootings and mob torture . Women seemed to get their clothes ripped off and also slapped in the face back and forth . There was some very clever old and young thieves who managed to rip off plenty of men and woman . Some of the police were former crooks and at times used this experience in their detective plans to catch the big mob fences , who did money laundering through out the country . Jack Palance of course played the king pin and was a bad guy who hid in an American Embassy . This is definitely a very low budget film , but great to see Jack Palance trying to make a few bucks .
416148	663392	110516	6.0	Lots of Comedy & Fun	Melanie Griffith , ( V ) played a woman of the streets who meets up with three boys who want to see what a girl looks like in the nude . Of course , if they really wanted to do it the correct way , they could ask their dad's and possibly their mothers . However , this is a Hollywood film and it made the entire story quite funny , especially when they have a sex education class and decided to use a rather non-kosher way of presenting the facts . Ed Harris , ( Tom Wheeler ) plays the father to Michael Patrick Carter , ( Frank Wheeler ) who gets to be good friends with Melanie Griffith and introduces her to his father . This is a very entertaining film and you can find fault with this film whether you are on the left or right side in life , but comedy and laughs are good for everyone and I recommend this film for great viewing .
418137	663392	24902	6.0	John Wayne had a Baby Face	Enjoyed this old time Western from 1934 with John Wayne , ( John Carruthers ) who sneaks into a hotel during a very bad thunder and lightning storm . The Sheriff , Jake Withers , ( Gabby Hayes ) gets a room and keeps his eye on a large sum of money deposited in the hotel safe .

Betty Mason , ( Eleanor Hunt ) adds some female charm to the film and John Carruthers falls madly in love with her big brown eyes . If you like classic western films , this is the film for you , the film locations are outstanding for 1934 . Enjoy .
416570	663392	43914	7.0	Great Acting	Spencer Tracy , ( James P . Curtayne ) , plays a lawyer who wants to get away from Criminal Law and go into Civil suits with not very much pressure , because he has a drinking problem .

Pat O'Brien , ( Detective Vincent Ricks ) is an old friend of James Curtayne and tries to help him stay focused on his law case and does give him some important leads . There are many twists and turns in this crime drama and Spencer Tracy gives one of his best performances in this Classic 1951 film .
417425	663392	38990	7.0	Hedy Lamarr Was Fantastic	Always enjoyed the great acting of Hedy Lamarr , ( Jenny Hager ) who plays a woman who has a very cruel and mean streak in her mind and soul . When she was a little girl she deliberately pushed a young boy in a steam knowing he could not swim and then proceeded to push him down deeper with her foot . Jenny grew up with a father who was the local town drunk and he use to beat her and abuse her until she finally got the attention of the town folk who rescued her from this horrible father .

418010	663392	39305	7.0	Bogart & Scott Film Classic	Enjoyed all of Humphrey Bogart's films along with a very sexy actress , Lizabeth Scott , ( ' Dusty ' Chandler ) who gave outstanding performances in their one and only film together . Bogart plays the role of Capt . ' Rip ' Murdock who is traveling by railroad with his Army buddy , Sgt . Johnny Drake , ( William Prince ) who is going to Washington , D . C . to receive a Medal of Honor award , but somehow disappears off the train . Rip decides to investigate his buddy's disappearance and runs into ' Dusty ' and finds out she was Johnny Drake's ex-girl friend and he seeks her help and assistance and becomes very much in love with her . There are some very dark secrets that ' Dusty ' is keeping from Rip and when these secrets are revealed this film will take you into another tricky ending . Great Classic and a very entertaining film which keeps your interest in the beginning , and gets rather slow and boring in the middle of the film , but the ending is a knock out .
416654	663392	39244	7.0	Marsha Hunt Gave an Outstanding Performance	Enjoyed this film from the very beginning to the end with great artists performing in Carnegie Hall and a great story revolving around a woman named Nora Ryan , ( Marsha Hunt ) and her son named Tony Salerno , Jr . , ( William Prince ) who wants her son to become a great concert pianist . Nora works in Carnegie Hall as a cleaning lady polishing brass rails and works hard to support her son who she loves very much . Tony grows up in Carnegie Hall and gets to meet all the famous conductors , singers and famous musicians . However , Tony wants to cut the apron strings of his mother and branches off to the modern dance bands and meets up with a very attractive gal which sort of breaks his mother's heart . If you like Classical Music and enjoy the great talents of super star talents from the past , this is the film for you . By the way , Marsha Hunt is approaching the age of 90 years and contributed a great deal of her acting ability to the Hollywood Silver Screen . Great film , don't miss it . Enjoy .

One guy was Mason , ( Gilbert Roland ) who knew Sam Cooper in past years and Sam figured he could trust him . There is one gal who appears in the town named Anna , ( Sarah Ross ) who is a sexy bar girl who gives Sam and eye full of her female charm . Brent the Blonde , ( Klaus Kinski ) is dressed up like a preacher but is a human rattlesnake who will give you one look and blow you away the next second . This film is very much like the Humphrey Bogart film , " Treasure of Sierra Madre " , but this film is full of cruel evil men lusting for gold and gold only .
416648	663392	35460	7.0	Great Classic 1942 Film	Greatly enjoyed this story written by John Steinbeck and a great cast of veteran actors who all gave outstanding performances .

416263	663392	94715	7.0	Midler & Hershey Were Great Together	Was not very certain if I really wanted to view this film , some times Midler can be way out in left field . However , in this film Bette Midler , ( CC Bloom ) , " That Old Feeling " , ' 97 plays a very self-centered person who will stop at nothing to get what she wants and if it is a career on the stage , just forget about love or a husband and children . Barbara Hershey , ( Hillary ) , " Riding the Bullet " , ' 04 , is a childhood friend of CC Bloom and in some ways they help each other , even though they are complete opposites . There is plenty of comedy , lots of fighting , and more drama than you can handle . Midler sings outstanding songs we all know by heart and it is a very entertaining film , but very very SAD !
417612	663392	44825	7.0	Great Film Classic	Jane Russell , ( Linda Rollins ) , " Outlaw " , was very pretty in 1952 and gave an outstanding performance as well as a singing act performed with Hoagy Carmichael ( Happy ) at the piano .

418092	663392	29347	7.0	Great 1937 Classic	Enjoyed viewing this great film classic from 1937 and enjoying a long forgotten actress , Deanna Durbin , ( Patsy Cardwell ) , " For the Love of Mary " . Patsy plays a very talented young girl who has a fantastic voice and a father who is an unemployed musician played by Adolphe Menjou , ( John Cardwell ) , " Bundle of Joy " . John Cardwell goes behind the scenes where Leopold Stokowsk has just conducted a Symphony Orchestra and asks him for a job as a trumpet player or even a trombone or whatever . There is some drama and great classical music selections along with plenty of comedy by great talents like Billy Gilbert and Eugene Palette ( John R . Frost ) , " The Mark of Zorro " . Leopold Stokowsk was a famous conductor during this period of time and married a few women and had children , one of the marriages was to Gloria Vanderbilt .

417012	663392	156820	7.0	Years were Hard on Ekberg	Enjoyed this film which had fantastic realistic scenes of drama , murder and both male and female nudity along with plenty of clowns and circus acts . This film is about Jean-Yves Thual , ( Lucien L'Hotte ) who works in a law office and gets involved with a rich older lady , Paola Bendoni , ( Anita Ekberg ) and eventually goes to bed with her and enjoys his sexual romance . However , Lucien L'Hotte really loves a very young girl in the circus and hopes someday to join her in the circus and have a great act together . There is a scene where Lucien jumps up on the desk of his boss in the law firm and proceeds to do a dump on his desk . There is lots of laughs along with a very entertaining film which is rather drawn out and very very slow . Enjoy
416942	663392	101761	7.0	Excellent Film	If anyone did not know anything about Jim Morrison and his rise to fame as a great Rock " N " Roll performer , Director Oliver Stone gave one fantastic biography in this film . Jim Morrison was played by Val Kilmer who gave a very outstanding performance who put his heart and soul into this role along with Meg Ryan , ( Pamela Courson ) who is a faithful young girl who fell in love with Jim after he walked into her bedroom and broke up her marriage . Pamela stayed with Jim through out his entire career from 1960 until his death in the 70's . There is nothing left for your imagination , plenty of female nudity , sex , drugs and indecent exposure by Jim Morrison on the stage of one of his rock band concerts which caused great commotion and put Jim Morrison into a court of law with jail sentences . Great film about a performer who had a great message but lost his way by using drugs and booze .
416897	663392	48254	7.0	Irene Kane & Jamie Smith Made this A Great Kubrick Film !	Missed this great film of director Stanley Kubrick in 1955 . The black and white effect was perfect for this depressing story . However , it was enjoyable watching these two actors , Jamie Smith ( Dave Gordon ) , " Only Fools & Horses ' 81 TV Series " and Irene Kane ( Gloria Price ) " All That Jazz " ' 79 , look at each other through the windows of their one room apartments in the same building , dressing and undressing and looking very depressed and down in the dumps . Jamie was a down and out prizer fighter and Gloria was a dance for hire gal , who was down on her luck working along Broadway , NYC and being taken advantage of by the villian , Frank Silvera ( Vincent Rapallo ) " Valdez Is Coming " ' 71 " . Stanley Kubrick wanted this film to be a very realistic film about two people being drawn together by hard luck , therefore , he had these actors act just the way ordinary people would act in REAL LIFE , it makes it appear that they are both poor actors , which is far from the truth . It was great to see a man and a woman become drawn to each other and be able to try and cope with their horrible situations in life . This a great Classic film by Stanley Kubrick ! !
417993	663392	39417	8.0	Great Rossellini Film	Greatly enjoyed this film that was directed and written by Roberto Rossellini , which was produced on a very low budget with actual real life scenes of the complete destruction of Germany after World War II . Rossellini even hired just regular people to act in this film and very few professional actors . Edmund Moeschke , ( Edmund ) was a little boy who struggles trying to find food and lived with a family where an Ex-Nazi hid out and never went outside and never earned a living . Edmund sold stolen goods in order to obtain money and wandered among all the ruins of the Germany city with a bunch of very poor boys and girls . This is a rather depressing film and clearly shows the horrors that Hitler brought upon the German people who had promised a great country that would be world rulers . This is a great Classic film with its unbelievable photography and great acting .
416780	663392	44953	8.0	Hardly Recognized Janet Leigh	This was a great James Stewart , ( Howard Kemp ) film where he plays the role of a rancher who has lost everything because his wife took off with another man and left him penniless . Howard has captured a man who is wanted for murder and has a reward set at $5 , 000 . 00 and he also has with him a very young gal named Lina Patch , ( Janet Leigh ) who won't leave him , Ben Vandergroat , ( Robert Ryan ) . As this group make their way through woods and mountains , they meet up with other men , like Roy Anderson , ( Ralph Meeker ) who was a soldier in the Civil War and has a dishonorable discharge from the Army and he wants to get in on this reward money for Ben Vandergroat . There is still another older man named Jesse Tote , ( Millard Mitchell ) who also wants his cut in the reward and is also interested in finding gold . Lina has her hands full trying to keep the men's hands off of her and she does a good job of not letting any of the guys get too close for comfort . There are fights with Indians and most of the fights are among themselves . Great 1953 Classic Western which has a different twist to the story .
416905	663392	36342	8.0	NIce Hitchcock Production	Always enjoyed the great acting of Joseph Cotten , ( Uncle Charlie ) who starts off this movie laying in bed and smoking a cigar and and just staring into space , with money thrown all over the floor of his boarding house room . His landlady tells him that two men were looking for him , but she told them he was not feeling very well and she did not want to disturb him . It is from this point in the film when Charlie decides to take off to visit his sister's family in a small town and hide out from who ever is trying meet up with him . Charlie is well liked by his sister's daughter , Charlie Newton , ( Teresa Wright ) who thinks the world of her uncle Charlie . Charlie Newton is a very smart young gal and starts to get suspicious of the way her uncle is acting and the story begins to get very interesting which will keep you glued to the silver screen . Great Hitchcock film with great actors and a great ending which will definitely surprise you .
416411	663392	64406	8.0	LEE REMICK TAMES JAMES COBURN	James Coburn ( John Cunninghman ) gets very distracted when Lee Remick ( Sheila Metcalfe ) enters his room as a hooker and gives him plenty of action . He almost forgets about doing his final hit to retire on . This film is filled with great actors , Burgess Meredith ( Ramsey Williams ) who also played in Rocky 1 and Rocky 2 . Karen Black ( Ellen ) and Sterling Hayden give excellelnt supporting roles along with Lilli Palmer ( Adrianne ) , Lee Remick's close friend . This film cannot be ignored , it has too many veteran actors to make it an all time classic film of the late 60's .
417039	663392	40525	8.0	Rita Hayworth Was Beautiful	Fantastic film Classic from 1947 which stars Rita Hayworth , ( Elsa Bannister ) who is married to a crippled husband named Arthur Bannister , ( Everett Sloane ) who loves to have fun with his wife and is very loving and yet very cruel to her . Arthur always wants his wife to cheat on him with another man and this lucky guy is Michael O'Hara , ( Orson Wells ) who finds employment on a yacht that Arthur Bannister is the skipper of and Michael attempts to charm the beautiful Elsa who immediately falls in love with Michael at the same time there are plenty of other men aboard the yacht that are planning for a murder and a possible scape goat for the crime . There are many failed attempts at trying to kill Arthur Bannister , but there are also tricky characters who are also interested in seeing Arthur killed . Just who is going to be the fall guy will be quite interesting as you view the ending of this great film Classic from 1947 .
417455	663392	289043	8.0	Lots of Blood on Their Lips !	Wow , this sure was a very very bloody film , which starts out very calm and quiet , with a guy in a hospital bed and then he finds himself wandering all over London , England . This poor guy winds up meeting another human being , a female who gives him guidance and romance . However , I forgot to mention that there also was a scene in the beginning which dealt with monkeys in a laboratory who seemed to have very bad tempers . All I can say about this picture without making it a SPOILER for everyone is this : It is the most horrifying , blood thirsty film I have seen in a very long time ; there are even French Kissing with blood all over the lips and face . This is just a warning !
416305	663392	24028	8.0	Great Cagney Film	Never viewed this film and enjoyed the singing and dancing by Cagney and the other cast members namely : Dick Powell , ( Scott Blair ) who had a great tenor voice and Ruby Keeler , ( Bea Thorn ) . James Cagney plays the role as Chester Kent who writes musicals and eventually goes into producing Prologues which are shown in between the feature films shown in movie theater's during the 1930's . Chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows . This is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs . Joan Blondell , ( Nan Prescott ) gave a great supporting role who was also very young and pretty . Dick Powell was great as a singer and dancer and just starting out with his long and successful screen career . Enjoy .
416029	663392	29737	9.0	Fashion Models in the 1930's !	Decided to watch this film and see what was going on in 1937 and what the charming ladies looked like in order to attract the opposite sex . Well , hats were the in THING , along with FURS , and some pretty nice styles with wild woman's hairdo's . Joan Bennett , ( Wendy Van Klettering ) , " Scarlet Street " , ' 45 , was very slim and trim and very attractive with a rather sexy voice . Wendy was not very happy about getting married and became " A Runaway Bride " in the 1930's . The husband she was to marry was , Alan Mowbray , ( Henry Morgan ) , " I Wake Up Screaming " , ' 41 , who played a rather dumb role and gave a great supporting role . Warner Baxter , ( George Curson ) , " Shadows in the Night " , ' 41 , ran a model agency and had all the best looking gals show off their fancy clothing . There was a great scene at the " COTTON CLUB " , and fantastic dancing and way out musicians . If you want to take a look way back into the past and see how that generation enjoyed themselves , this is worth viewing .
417221	663392	491729	9.0	Entertaining Mystery	Always like a film that starts out in an old cemetery where lost souls hang around and people sometimes wind up in trouble . That is what happens in this story , you see a young girl drive her car near an old cemetery , needing tender loving care and all of a sudden she speaks to a man through a fence and that is when the story really starts to get interesting . Jovanna Huguet , ( Christie McDermott ) , gives a great performance as a TV reporter who manages to get deeply involved with the circumstances of this case and brings in many other great supporting actors . There are many twists and turns to the plot and you are kept pretty much in the dark as to what is really going on . I will tell you this , the film does return to that Old Cemetery and reveals some interesting secrets to this case . Enjoy
417958	663392	95631	10.0	De Niro & Grodin at Their Very Best !	If you like De Niro and Grodin , this is definitely the film for you to enjoy . These two actors can do some very fancy and quick speaking lines back and forth with each other that will make you laugh . Along with some very deep thoughts which are tossed around by both of them , and a very sad scene facing his daughter after many years absence . Robert DeNiro , ( Jack Walsh ) , " Heat " , was an ex-cop who had a rough time and had not seen his wife or daughter for nine years and has the task of trying to transport Charles Grodin , ( Jonathan Mardukas ) , " Beethoven " , ' 92 , to Los Angles by a certain date and time . Naturally there are bondsmen involved and Mob guys who do some very comical mistakes trying to catch Jonathan Mardukas . There are car chases , railroad freight car rides , and even a brief duster plane along with many many different types of cars . This is a very Classic film and worth seeing over and over again .
416354	663392	30714	10.0	Enjoyed this Old Timer	This was a definite look back at the past when John Wayne was very young and starting out on a great career in films . There really is no stampede , except the bad guys trying to blame Stony Brooke , ( John Wayne ) for a crime he did not commit . However , the local town people want justice and are convinced that Stony is responsible for this crime and must pay for it . Stony is put in jail and his lady friend , Nanvy Carson visits him while the jail is set on fire and they are both destined to die in the blaze . Tucson Smith , ( Ray Corrigan ) and Lullaby Joslin , ( Max Terhune ) try to come to his rescue . Lullaby Joslin is also a ventriloquist and there are some funny scenes with his dummy talking and making jokes . If you look real close , you will see the famous villain of all Western Films , Charlie King . Great John Wayne Classic film , enjoy .
417176	663392	101316	10.0	JANE MARCH IS A SUPER STAR !	When this film started off , I had no idea in just what direction this film was going to take me . The photography in Vietnam was outstanding and Jane March ( The Young girl ) and her famous " Mans Hat " had me quite confused . However , when Tony Leung Ka ( The Chinaman ) appeared on the screen and started making SPARKS with Jane March , I realized that this was a very deep and beautiful love story that really went way beyond the bedroom mattress . This film showed that LOVE will break down all walls of bigotry , race or religious beliefs and even an age gap cannot stop the love between a man or woman or young lady . It is very sad that this couple could never grow old together and be able to look back at their wonderful romantic experiences ! A deep film with a great message , don't miss it !
416118	663392	217869	10.0	Great Acting by Bruce Willis !	Greatly enjoyed the acting performed by Bruce Willis , ( David Dunn ) , " The Whole Ten Yards , " ' 04 , David Dunn was a man who escaped death and was trying to find out WHY ! and what his purpose in life should be . Samuel L . Jackson , ( Elijah Price ) , " South Africa " , ' 04 , tried to find David Dunn in order to direct his life and his destiny . It is very easy to find this film boring if you do not understand the deep Spiritual meaning the director of the film is trying to portray . Bruce Willis and Samuel L . Jackson both had difficult roles to perform and did an outstanding job . The director of this film has also produced another great picture for the Summer called , " The Village " , ' 04 with William Hurt in the starring role . If you love Bruce Willis and his acting , this is the film for YOU !
416510	663392	118715	10.0	Never Stopped Laughing	Missed seeing this very entertaining film with Jeff Bridges , ( Jeffrey Lebowski , The Dude ) and John Goodman , ( Walter Sobchak ) who are great pals and bowl using every curse word ever used and even more ! Jeffrey Lebowski is a very lazy guy and loves to drink White Russians and manages to get himself involved with a kidnapping of a young girl , named Bunny , ( Tara Reid ) who is married to a very rich older man . A woman named Maude Lebowski , ( Julianne Moore ) wants to have a baby and she decides to make love to Jeffrey who is not his wife and never intends to marry a man , rather way out in left field scene . Steve Busemi , ( Jeffrey Lebowski ) gives a great supporting role . This is a great comedy filled with all kinds of surprises and plenty of shocking words thrown back and forth with each of the actors .
417587	663392	264192	10.0	One Soul Reaching Another Soul	This was a very soul searching film with great acting by Jane Seymour who played ( Jenny Cole / Mary Sutton , " Touching Wild Horses " , ' 02 . Jenny Cole seems to have troubling dreams about a family in a small town in Ireland where a woman has to put up with a drunkard of a husband and a child abuser . He is told that his wife with lose her life if she has any more children and her husband is too busy drinking to really care . There is great photography in Ireland and former veteran actor Hume Cronyn , ( Sonny Sutton ) , " The Pelican Brief " , ' 92 , plays the older son to Mary Sutton and gives a great supporting role . You will need some tissues to view this film and some belief in the Spiritual World !
416875	663392	39017	10.0	One of the Best Classic Sherlock Holmes Films !	Movie goers in the late 1930's and 40's thought this team of actors performed exactly how Sherlock Holmes was suppose to be in real life . Basil Rathbone , ( Sherlock Holmes ) , " The Black Cat " , ' 41 always gave an outstanding performance and his very appearance added greatly to his role as the famous English detective from London , England . Nigel Bruce ( Dr . John H . Watson ) , " The Corn Is Green " , ' 45 played the sidekick to Holmes and appeared goofy at sometimes . This entire film dealt with a long train ride , running in and out of compartments and even looking into a coffin . Alan Mowbray , ( Maj . Duncan-Bleek ) , " I Wake Up Screaming " , ' 41 gave a great supporting role and kept Dr . Watson busy playing Gin Rummy during the " Lionel Train Ride " in Black & White ! Skelton Knaggs , ( Sands ) , " Bedlam " , ' 46 , put his ugly face into the plot and as always gave a great supporting role . If you love Classic Holmes Films and these great veteran actors , this is just one of the great films Rathbone & Bruce appeared in !
418059	663392	43751	10.0	Great Fiction Story of Early Texas Events	Greatly enjoyed this film which is not a documentary film on the history of Texas , but a very enjoyable film with great actors like Clark Gable . Clark Gable plays ( Devereaux Burke ) , " Mogambo " , ' 53 , who wants Texas to become part of the Union and met with Lionel Barrymore , ( Andrew Jackson ) , " Key Largo " , ' 48 , in Washington , and decided to find a very powerful Texan , named Thomas Craden , ( Broderick Crawford ) , " Hightway Patrol " , ' 55 TV Series , who was against Texas from joining the Union and wanted it to remain a LONE STAR STATE . Ava Gardner , ( Martha Ronda ) , " The Snows of Kilimanjaro , " , 52 , who was a very strong willed woman who ran a newspaper and was also a so called girl friend of Thomas Craden which caused great problems between Burke . This is a Hollywood story that is meant to entertain and the veteran actors in this film have created this film into a great black and white Classic .
416078	663392	240793	10.0	NOT LIKE THE TYPICAL BLOOD SUCKING DRACULA FILMS !	It was very refreshing to view this Dracula film without the sexy women and the two ( 2 ) marks on their neck , like the Bela Lugosi classic films . I could write two-hundred words about this film and even tell you the ending . However , if you are a fan of Jane March ( Lidia ) " Amdnt , L " 91 you will love her performance as the wife of Rudolf Martin ( Vlad the Impaler ) " Swordfish " ' 01 . Lidia plays a young sweet and innocent virgin who plans to become a Nun and is charmed by Vlad and the sparks fly immediately and the baby soon arrives . Peter Weller ( Father Stefan ) " Styx " ' 01 tries to prevent Dracula from spreading his evil in the world , unfortunately , Dracula movies must continue to be produced from one generation to another . If you like History of Dracula , this is the film for you ! !
417691	663392	52242	10.0	Excellent Film About Drugs	This film reminded me about a film called , " The Man with the Golden Arm " starring Frank Sinatra and Kim Novack and this film clearly shows the horrors of withdrawal from the drug of heroin . Three young men get involved with a suitcase that holds a very large supply of uncut heroin and wind up throwing it away , thinking it was a cleansing powder and it winds up in a garbage dump which they manage to rescue . The young men decided to sell this drug and are able to make plenty of money by filtering it out through and old time heroin user . There are some girl friends in this film who try to stop these guys and tell them to turn the drugs into the police , but they do not face the consequences of turning themselves in . This is a great 1958 classic film filmed in Los Angeles , California and there is also some pretty way out music through out the film that makes this a very exciting black and white film .
416562	663392	35015	10.0	Cast of Classic Giants of the Silver Screen	When I first viewed this film I was very impressed and as the years past , I see that many generations have felt the same way about a masterpiece of American Film Production . Orson Wells put his complete heart and soul into the production of this film ; it certainly topped all his other films . It seems Wells loved Joseph Cotton who appeared in this film as , Eugene , " Niagra " , ' 53 , who was very deeply in love with Dolores Costello , ( Isabel ) , " Outside These Walls " , ' 39 , who was simply beautiful in those days and was a very elegant lady and sweet as sugar . Ann Baxter , ( Lucy ) , " The Blue Gardenia " , ' 52 , was full of joy and pep in this film and also fell in love with Tim Holt , ( George ) , " Hot Lead " , 51 . However , poor Lucy seemed to wait and wait for George to decide how he was ever going to earn a living , and did not really want to do anything in life except live and love his MOTHER . Enjoyed the great acting of Agnes Moorehead , ( Fanny ) , " Bewitched " , ' 64 TV Series , who played a spinster and added greatly to her supporting role . Glad I viewed this film again , it had deeper meaning to me this time around . Tim Holt was always a cowboy to me and appeared in many Westerns , in this film he completely surprised me , except when he was in the horse and carriage with Lucy !
416217	663392	108717	10.0	Great Medieval Mystery Series	Enjoyed this series of " Cadfael " which ran on TV in 1994 about a monk named Brother Cadfael , ( Derek Jacobi ) who gives Spiritual help and heals the wounded and sick and also is a detective who delves into the human soul and manages to get criminals and evil people to either turn over a new way of living or just face their punishment and be hanged or sent to prison . In one of these TV Series , " The Devil's Novice " a young man decides to enter the monastery and become a monk and he is questioned about why he wants to become a monk and at night he seems to have nightmares and starts screaming and causing all kinds of problems which make the monks think he is possessed by the Devil . However , it turns out that this young man was in love with his brother's girl-friend and his heart was broken and his father suggested he go immediately to the monastery and become a monk . Brother Cadfael searches this young man's heart and soul and finds very dark deep secrets which involves many other people in his family .
417631	663392	26426	10.0	LOTS OF INFIDELITY AND LIES !	Enjoyed viewing this great film classic and the great acting of Kay Francis ( Georgiana Summers ) , " Play Girl " , ' 41 who loved to fool around with George Brent ( " Bob " McNear ) , " The Great Lie " , ' 41 who was a married man . It seemed that everyone else in the picture played husband and wife with lots of infidelity and everyone telling little white lies about who is married to who and why we have to have different rooms to sleep in and why we have twin beds in our rooms . It seems that being divorced was a very evil thing and talking about their " EX " husbands was the in THING ! . Genevieve Tobin ( Betty Summers ) , " The Petrified Forest " , ' 36 and John Eldridge ( Lawrence Thurston ) , " Superman " , ' 73 enjoyed stealing automobiles ( coupe type ) and even going into being a jewel thief . It was great viewing this film and seeing just what people were watching during the YEAR 1935 . This film was probably considered X rated . The old gas stations , furniture and women's fashions , plus the modern auto's in the 1930's made this a great film classic with all these young actors starting out in their film careers .
416512	663392	30241	10.0	Super Film to View	Katherine Hepburn , ( Linda Seton ) is a young girl who's father is a millionaire and also has another daughter named Julia Seton , ( Doris Nolan ) and they get along with each other until one day when Julia meets up with Johnney Case , ( Cary Grant ) and they fall in love . Johnney does not realize that he is fallen in love with a very rich young lady and when he calls on her in order to ask for her fathers permission to marry Julia he is quite surprised with the large home in which they all dwell in . It seems that both of these daughters seem to fall in love with Johnney Case and Linda tries to hide this fact and encourages Julia to marry Johnney . There is some problems that occur between wanting to make money all your life or just get off the merry-go-round and be just an ordinary person and take time to enjoy the real pleasures of living . Great film with great acting and truly a great film Classic .
416888	663392	56903	10.0	Bobby Darin Showed His Great Talents	This film has many great Classic Actors and the entire film is very entertaining and has lots of laughs . Gregory Peck , ( Capt . Josiah Newman , M . D . ) , " Cape Fear " , ' 62 , was the officer in charge of the mental section of the Army and had a great ability to calm his patients on some occasions and wrap them around his finger . He managed to recruit Angie Dickinson , ( Lt . Francie Corum ) , " Dressed To Kill " , ' 80 , who was a very young and sexy nurse who was not certain if she really wanted to work for Capt . Newman . Tony Curtis , ( Cpl . Jackson ' Jake ' , Leibowitz ) , " The Mirror Crack'd " , ' 80 , gave a great supporting role but the character he played did not seem to fit into this story . The real star of the film was Bobby Darin , ( Cpl . Jim Tompkins ) , " State Fair " , ' 62 who showed his great abilities as an actor and entertainer . Darin performed a few musical numbers and really made this film into a great Classic .
418012	663392	43338	10.0	Kirk Douglas was Outstanding	This is a great film about a newspaper reporter who burned himself out in New York City with lots of boozing and fooling around with plenty of women . This reporter is Chuck Tatum , ( Kirk Douglas ) who comes to town in Albuquerque , New Mexico in a tow truck after all his tires blew out . Chuck seeks employment from a local Albuquerque Newspaper and manages to get a position on the paper . Chuck gets a big assignment to cover a rattlesnake convention but finds a more interesting story about the cave in of a mine which traps Leo Minosa , ( Richard Benedict ) . Chuck knows from past experience that this will make a great story and he contacts all the right connections for a doctor , construction engineers and the local sheriff . Lorraine Minosa , ( Jan Sterling ) is the wife of Leo and is really bored with her marriage and Lorraine becomes interested in Chuck Tatum . This entire event brings a media circus to this New Mexico story . This is a film that will capture your attention from the very beginning to the very end , there is some very serious signs of violence and romance . This is a great Kirk Douglas film who gave an outstanding performance along with Jan Sterling who was very sexy and also a very tough and rough gal .
416283	663392	39437	10.0	About Love & Hate and the Slip of the Pen	Have not viewed this film in years and was completely surprised at almost everything in the entire film . It starts out rather slow , a bit boring and all of a sudden everything seems to happen . Lana Turner , ( Marianne Patourel ) , " The Bad & The Beautiful " , ' 52 , gave one of her greatest performances with a very dramatic acting role along with Van Heflin ( Timothy Haslam ) , " Tap Roots " , ' 46 who could not help but follow Marianne's business advice and also gave in to all her demands . Donna Reed , ( Marguerite Patourel ) , " The Last Time I Saw Paris " , ' 54 , played a woman who was deeply in love through out the entire picture and became very frustrated . Donna Reed gave an outstanding performance and could bring tears to your eyes . Edmund Gwenn ( Octavius Patourel ) , " Miracle on 34th St . " , ' 47 was the father to the two sisters and revealed great secrets as the film progressed . Frank Morgan , ( Dr . Edmund Ozanne ) , " The Wizard of Oz " , ' 39 , played a great supporting role as a heavy drinking doctor who greatly loved his son . I noticed Linda Christian , ( Hin Moa ) , " Thunderstorm " , ' 56 playing a brief role in this film , Linda Christian was the former wife of Tyrone Power . This is a masterpiece of a Classic Film which even had great pictures of Old Clipper Ships with their majestic Sails . Don't miss this Picture .
416747	663392	22285	10.0	BORIS KARLOFF AS A PROFESSOR !	Taped this Richard Dix film in the early 70's and never realized that Boris Karloff made an appearance in this film . Dix ( Pike Winslow ) plays a Robin Hood in this film and seeks to correct all the wrong doing of blue collar executives in high places , ( which sounds like 2003 ) who try to cheat people with their share holdings . Pike leaves his calling card , " The Reckoner " , which means you are in trouble and will likely go to jail . He has sidekicks , namely Boris Karloff ( Professor ) who do all the undercover work so Pike Winslow can get them behind bars . A sweet charming and sexy looking young blond girl ( or lady like she wants to be called ) Barbara Gerry ( Shirley Grey ) fell in love with Pike when she was 12 and he was 18 . Winslow finds out that her father has lost his entire fortune to these crooks and she will be out in the street with her aunt . The acting and film direction is fantastic , all the actors were very professional . This was Shirley Grey's first film debut and Boris Karloff was eager for work and was beginning to be seen in Hollywood , around the time of " Criminal Code " and " Frankenstein " . I noticed that Max Steiner wrote the music for his film and was uncredited . This was a great film classic that I was happy I taped years ago and will enjoy for many years in the future . Richard Dix had a great magic in his acting that will live on forever andever .
418064	663392	338556	10.0	Lots of Hot Love Making	This TV film was great , it had lots of romance , mystery and the story kept me guessing right to the very end . Angie Everhart , ( Lana ) , " Bare Witness " , ' 02 , married a very very rich older man and kept him very busy in bed much to his delight . However , the rich man's son returns from Harvard and accidentally walks into her bathroom while she is in her birth day suit and from then on , sparks seem to fly and the plot takes off in more ways than one . Andrew W . Walker , ( Holden ) , " The Secret Pact " , ' 99 , is the rich man's son and after staying around the mansion for a while and getting to really know his father , he finds out his father has some very horrible and mysterious hang ups . You will find this film very hard to figure out and it is a very well produced film to enjoy .
417476	663392	39826	10.0	Classic Film With Great Actors !	Have not seen this film in years and decided to look at all the great Classic actors who were all very young and at the height of their careers ! Douglas Fairbanks , Jr . ( Sinbad ) , " Red & Blue " , ' 67 , played an excellent Sinbad and followed in his fathers footsteps , Fairbanks Senior . Maureen O'Hara , ( Shireen ) , " Big Jake " , ' 71 , was beautiful and put her heart and soul into her role as a captured lady among savages on old sailing vessels . Walter Slezak , ( Melik ) , " Black Beauty " , ' 71 , played a crafty old fox who was able to find treasure that no one ever thought he was capable of finding . Anthony Quinn ( Emir ) , " Last Action Hero " , ' 93 kept after Sinbad and tried to capture the heart strings of Shireen and plenty of wealth ! Great Classic film to enjoy , the background scenery is very typical 1947 !
416093	663392	364882	10.0	Great Chili Mining Story	Greatly enjoyed viewing this fantastic portrayal of a rich man who owns a Coal Mine and treats the miners as slaves with low wages and poor working conditions . This rich man puts Ernesto Malbran , ( Mister Davis ) as foreman who brutalizes the men and even kills them if they ever think about having a Miners Association , or type of union . Francisco Reyes , ( Fernando ) , " Docteur Chance " , ' 97 grew up in the mine and lost his own father while he was working deep down below in Hell . Paulina Galvez , ( Virginia ) , " Face of Terror " , ' 03 was a former girl friend of Fernando and their romances is renewed as she returns to Lota , Chili to teach in the local school . Virginia and Fernando burn up the bedroom and bed sheets in quite a few scenes and they also look great dancing together . The story of Coal Miners is true in every country in this world , they are never given the true wages they deserve or the safe working conditions , lets hope things improve in the 21st Century . Good Film to Enjoy Watching .
417777	663392	25878	10.0	Great Classic Film	The film producers of this Thin Man Film never realized this first film starring William Powell , ( Nick Charles ) and Myrna Loy , ( Nora Charles ) would be such a great success and would go on and have six other Thin Man series . Nick & Nora Charles are newlyweds very much in love and are going to San Francisco for a honeymoon train ride . However , Nick is a detective and gets himself in a murder investigation in New York City and works with the police to solve a very mysterious story with murders and plenty of twists and turns right to the very end . This film is very fast paced and has lots of comedy with a fox terrier who steals lots of the scenes from the actors . Cesar Romero makes a brief appearance in this film along with Maureen O'Sullivan , ( Dorothy Wynant ) who was the wife of John Farrow a producer and was the mother of Mia Farrow . In my opinion this is the best of the Thin Man Films , and William Powell and Myrna Loy had a great magic with their performance as husband and wife . Enjoy .
416063	663392	60196	10.0	ELI WALLACH WAS THE STAR !	As many times as I have viewed this film , I greatly admire the entire picture for just plain enjoyable entertainment and seeing great actors such as Clint Eastwood ( Joe ) " Absolute Power " ' 97 and the entire cast make this an all time classic . However , Eli Wallach ( Tuco ) " Mackenna's Gold " ' 69 put his very heart and soul into his film role and gave a fantastic performance that over powered the entire cast . Trying to put this film under a magnifying glass and trying to be critical and tearing it into little pieces is not necessary , just sit back and enjoy a great masterpiece of GOOD ENTERTAINMENT !
416082	663392	71455	10.0	THIS FILM TOPPED ALL THE EARTHQUAKE FILMS !	Earthquake 1974 is a classic film with outstanding film actors who will never be forgotten . Charlton Heston ( Steward Graff ) ( " Ben Hur " ' 59 ) ; Ava Gardner ( Remy Royce Graff ) ( " Barefoot Contessa'54 starring with Humphrey Bogart ) ; George Kennedy , ( Sgt . Lew Slade ) ( " Blue Knight TV series and " Cool Hand Luke " ' 67 ) ; Lorne Greene ( Sam Royce ) ( " Bonanza " ' 59 ) ; Barry Sullivan ( Dr . Willis Stockle ) ( " Harlow " 65 ) ; Lloyd Nolan ( Dr . James Vance ) ( " A Tree Grows in Brooklyn " ' 45 ) and last but not least , Walter Matthau ( A DRUNK in a bar ) ( " Sunshine Boys'75 ) All these actors made this film a great classic , not the special effects , lets remember , this film was made in 1974 not in year 2000 . There will never be another Earthquake Film with such great actors giving their complete support to make this an enjoyable entertainment for generations in the future to admire and respect . This is not a film to be critical about , all actors have to make a living , whether they are old or young ! ! !
416586	663392	45041	10.0	Thomas Gomez Was Fantastic	Greatly enjoyed this film which had great photography in Arizona and showed in great detail the Native American dwellings and customs . Tyrone Power ( Constable Duncan MacDonald ) , " The Eddy Duchin Story " , ' 56 , played a young Canadian Mounted Police Constable who was on a mission to rescue settlers who were captured and held hostage . Thomas Gomez , ( Natayo Smith ) , " Key Largo " , ' 48 gave an outstanding performance as a guide to Duncan through the Indian country and demanded great rewards for his services . Penny Edwards , ( Emerald Neeley ) , " Two Guys from Texas " , ' 48 was the only white woman around and was greatly abused through out the entire picture . Despite all the conflicts among the Indians and the White folks , Duncan MacDonald was able to adopt a young boy as his son with the Indian community blessings . I have seen Thomas Gomez perform in many Classic films , but I truly enjoyed his great acting abilities in this film and regret he had a very short lived career .
416279	663392	48750	10.0	A Funeral Service Never Takes Place	This is truly a great Classic film which was produced while President , Dwight D . Eisenhower was in office . In those days , this picture was not very well received and considered a very poor comedy and in bad taste . However , over the many years this film has found itself as a great Classic . Edmund Gwenn , ( Capt . Albert Wiles ) , " The Keys of the Kingdom " , ' 44 , put his heart and soul into this part and carried this picture on his back . Another great actress , Mildred Natwich , ( Miss Ivy Gravely ) , " The Kissing Bandit " , ' 48 gave a great supporting role as a lonely older woman looking very hard at Capt . Albert Wiles as her later in life Soul Mate . John Forsythe , ( Sam Marlowe ) , " Charlie's Angels " , ' 76 TV Series starts falling in love with Shirley McLaine and even hints about wanting to see her in the nude on his very first meeting with her . Sam Marlowe , is an artist and draws very very way out pictures . Jerry Mathers , ( Arnie Rogers ) , " Leave it to Beaver " , ' 57 TV Series , gave a wonderful supporting role . Everyone over the years seems to either love this picture or find it TROUBLING to VIEW and consider it a very poor film .
416040	663392	265666	10.0	Great Acting , Great FILM !	Enjoyed this film and the great acting skills performed by all the great stars . The complete family was nuts and also quite normal at times and went to all kinds of extremes in showing the various personalities of each member of the Tenenbaums Family . Gene Hackman ( Royal Tenenbaum ) , " Behind Enemy Lines " , ' 01 , was a very misunderstood dad who did everything possible to get the respect he needed as an up standing DAD ! Angelica Huston , ( Etheline Tenenbaum ) , " Daddy Day Care " , ' 03 , tried to be a faithful wife and seemed to get deeply involved with Danny Glover ( Henry Sherman ) , " The Cook Out " , ' 04 who was quite funny and very entertaining through out the entire film . Gwyneth Paltrow , ( Margot Tenenbaum ) , " View From the Top " , ' 03 , looked very comical and had me laughing about her horrible habit of smoking and she never seemed to stop through out almost every scene . If you love these actors , you will see them perform very difficult roles with great professional skills .
418047	663392	473105	10.0	Nice Close Up of Bats !	Found this film very entertaining and horrifying with a real close up to a bats face and horrible teeth and angry looks . These bats had a devil looking way of dealing with humans and animals . It took quite a while before some of the local people and mostly college students discovered the fact that bats had taken on an aggressive attitude to loud , wild music and were mostly turned on to red hot blood flowing humans . Lucy Lawless , ( Maddy Rierdon ) , gave an outstanding performance and showed off her great body form . There was lots of wild parties and plenty of young gals and guys getting really spaced out . One girl started foaming at the mouth in class and caused a great deal of gasps in the classroom . Great film and lots of fun to watch , especially the Vampire Bats !
416023	663392	29310	10.0	A Great Classic Film	Remember my parents telling me how great this film was and the great acting performed by all the actors . It is great to see other generations enjoying this great story that was performed on the New York City stage and then the 1937 film version . Robert Montgomery , ( Danny ' Babyface ' ) , " Lady in the Lake " , ' 47 , played a rather strange fellow who became quite involved with Rosalind Russell , ( Olivia Grayne ) , " Wonderful Town " , ' 58 who lived with her Aunt , Dame May Witty , ( Mrs . Bramson ) , " The White Cliffs of Dover " , ' 44 . Danny was hired by Mrs . Bramson , who was delighted with his great wit and charming personality . This is certainly a very dramatic film which reveals deep hidden secrets about each persons mental feelings and childhood problems that some of them share with each other . Dame May Witty , was the first woman awarded the title of Dame in 1918 , which stands for Knight in the United Kingdom . A must see great Classic film of 1937
416081	663392	59712	10.0	THIS WAS A SHIP OF CLASSIC ACTORS !	" Ship of Fools " is a great film and always will be , because of great actors like : Vivien Leigh ( Mary Treadwell ) " Gone With the Wind " ' 39 ; Simone Signoret , ( La Condesa ) " Room At The Top " ' 59 ; Jose Ferrer ( Siegfried Riebu ) " Vovage of the Damned " ' 76 along with Oskar Werner ( Willie Schumann ) " Fahrenheit 451 " ' 66 . All these actors gave great supporting roles to each other and allowed Lee Marvin to rise up and put his name on the Silver Screen as a true Oscar Winner . As you view this picture , you learn moral lessons about how people of all races and religion are all brothers and sister's who have to overlook the bigotry that clings to people's hearts and souls . No matter if you are in First Class , Second Class or Third Class , you have a great role in life with various talents to share with others . Lets hope our own individual ship causes us to treat others with understanding and kindness . This is a great FILM CLASSIC with a very deep message for all generations to enjoy if you look close enough !
416334	663392	44423	10.0	Great Karloff Classic Film	All Boris Karloff fans will love this classic film , where Karloff is the castle physician and gives his patients excellent attention . Sir Ronald Burton , ( Richard Greene ) , an eighteenth-century English adventurer , believes his two friends have been murdered by Count Von Bruno , ( Stephen McNally ) on his Black Forest estate . Arriving at Von Bruno's castle to accumulate evidence , Burton learns Von Bruno's unhappy wife Elga ( Paula Corday ) , . and Dr . Meissen ( Boris Karloff ) , the castle physician , are virtual prisoners . Suspecting Burton's motives , Von Bruno and Gargon ( Lon Chaney Jr . , ) a giant , mute scarred henchman , discover the Englishman was responsible for their being captured and tortured . You will definitely have to view this great Classic Karloff Film to enjoy the ending .
416478	663392	117002	10.0	JULIA ROBERTS CAN PERFORM ALL ACTING ROLES !	Julia Roberts ( Mary Reilly ) fell in love with two ( 2 ) men in this picture , MR . GOOD & MR . EVIL , Dr . Henry Jekyll / Mr . Edward Hyde ( John Malkovich ) It was a very well directed film and these two actors kept you on the edge of your seats . It was a different experience sharing the very dark secrets of Dr . Hyde and his evil and devil like ways . The scene where Dr . Jekyll struggles with Dr . Hyde poping out of his skin , could very well been cut out . This picture is about the on going struggle which people face dealing with Good & Evil within themselves . Julia Roberts asked the question : " Does Good Overcome Evil ! " in this world ? All Julia Roberts fans must see this picture sometime or other .
416482	663392	191754	10.0	REHAB COMEDY MIXED WITH PAINFUL WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS !	The producers of this film did a great job of showing everyday life in a chemical dependent center , where Gwen Cummings ( Sandra Bullock ) finally wound up after almost killing herself and destroying her sister's entire Wedding . This film showed what it is like in a REHAB CENTER and the horrible struggles the human body has to go through in order to get rid of the drug and alcohol " Monkies On Their Backs " . There is a great deal of humor as the patients start to get back to normal and try to help each other . Mike O'Malley , ( Yes , Dear TV series star ) is a patient , who tries to help Gwen and still wears his trademark BASEBALL CAP ! If you are somewhat interested in what a REHAB is basically about , this is an excellent film , where they show group therapy and others trying to share their horrible experiences and at the same time help each other to recover on a DAY AT A TIME BASIS , which takes a life time ! Being Drunk is not a funny matter like Hollywood use to make it out to be , it is simply a loss of SELF CONTROL ! Enjoy the picture , it is a good one , and Sandra Bullock carried the entire picture on her back !
416954	663392	55892	10.0	Outstanding Acting / Great Picture	This was an outstanding film dealing with two young people who had mental problems that were deep seeded into their minds and how they both struggled ; to help each other find the light at the end of the tunnel . Keir Dullea , ( David Clemens ) " De Sade " , ' 69 , played the role of ayoung man coming from a rich family , who had a big hang up about anyone touching him in any way , even with a pinkie finger . If you did touch him , he went crazy and carried on like a brat of a child . Janet Margolin , ( Lisa Brandt ) , " Annie Hall " , ' 77 , was another mentally disturbed young girl , pretty and seemed to glow when she looked at David . Howard Da Silva , ( Dr . Swinford ) , " The Great Gatsby " , ' 74 was the shrink in charge of the mental facility and had a full time job just trying to get David & Lisa to open up their twisted and disturbed minds . Great acting and a very enjoyable film , which at times is depressing and very down to earth .
416323	663392	44480	10.0	History of a Famous Gun Inventor !	Some how I just seemed to have missed this great film of James Stewart and his great acting and a very entertaining film . James Stewart , ( David Marshall , ' Marsh ' , Williams ) , " Bell Book & Candle " , ' 58 , winds up in a prison camp with nice stripe uniforms and a very bad attitude towards writing home to his wife , and his prison warden , Wendell Corey , ( Capt . H . T . Peoples ) , " The Big Knife " , ' 55 . Capt . Peoples tries to break Marsh down to his way of thinking and as a result , he starts making automatic weapons . Jean Hagen , ( Maggie Williams ) , " The Big Knife " , ' 55 , gave an outstanding supporting role as the wife of Marsh . If you want to see a young Stewart and a very entertaining story , watch this great CLASSIC !
416667	663392	430650	10.0	Diane Keaton was Fantastic	Diane Keaton gave an outstanding performance in this rather sad but funny story which involved quite a few young people and their deep dark secrets . Diane Keaton , ( Natalie ) , " The Family Stone " , ' 05 , who had an only daughter and loved her beyond words can describe . She always called her and told her , " Surrender Dorothy " , which was an expression used in the ' Wizard of Oz ' , 1939 . A sudden car accident occurs and Natalie gets herself deeply involved with her daughter's friends and lovers . As Natalie investigates , the more truths she finds out about herself and her real relationship with her daughter . Great film to view and enjoy , especially all the good acting from all the supporting actors .
416789	663392	945314	10.0	Realistic / Down to Earth / What Life is All About	Outstanding film which maybe rather short in length but it tells more in ten ( 10 ) minutes than a two hour film . There is unhappy men and women who are desperate for a different kind of experience with a male or female and feel trapped in their marriage or relationships . This story will always be successful because people like to view people who do things they would like to do or have done against their husband and wives . The Director and Producer have contributed great talent to the entertainment industry and desire complete praise . I sincerely hope that these talented people all produce many more great films that will entertain us in the up and coming years into the future .
416621	663392	240468	10.0	Very Enjoyable & Funny	This film took me by surprise from the very beginning to the end , it is truly a great comedy with lots of action and plenty of belly laughs . As a baby , the Chosen One ( Steve Oedekerk ) , " Thumbtanic " , ' 02 , does some very unusual things , like rolling down hills and is ready to handle his own against his enemies . Fei Lung , ( Master Pain ( Betty ) , " Angel of Fury " , ' 92 plays the wicked man who does everything to kill the Chosen One as an infant right up to being a full grown man . Jennifer Tung , ( Whoa ) , " Conlagion " , ' 01 gives some romance to the film and also manages to assist the Chosen One from making any wrong decisions . This is an excellent film with plenty of entertainment and something entirely different in the way of Comedy . Enjoy
416074	663392	13802	10.0	1922 Classic Film	Love to look at old films way before my time and especially this film which was made up of mostly still photos and about one-third of the film on tape . Fanny Midgley gives a great performance with Rudolph Valentino who captures his heart and Valentino does everything in his power to bring her to the altar , but Fanny is not convinced because of the color of his skin being from India . Fanny reads in a book that skin color should not make a difference if you are in love and Fanny discovers she changes her mind and her way of thinking . This film will take you to India , Connecticut and some people are able to foretell about the future . If you like very old films , this is a great 1922 Classic . Enjoy
418103	663392	44413	10.0	Fantastic Photography & Great Western Story !	This is truly a great Classic Western with the best super stars of all time . The special photography with cattle going up and down rocky hills and the many covered wagons and beautiful scenery of the Northwest was outstanding . James Stewart , ( Glyn McLyntock ) , " Broken Arrow " , ' 50 , was a wagon train guide , and also had a wicked past life he was trying to forget about . Glyns wicked past came in hand having to face many situations that required lots of fighting and gun action . Arthur Kennedy ( Emerson Cole ) , " Nevada Smith " , ' 66 gave a very outstanding performance and also gave Glyn a real hard time because they both had past careers that were almost the same , however , Glyn was hateful deep in his very soul ! Julie Adams , ( Laura Baile ) , " Slim Carter " , ' 57 was very beautiful and had a hard time trying to find out which guy she really wanted to HOOK ! Rock Hudson , ( Trey Wilson ) , " Iron Man , " , ' 51 , was a gambler and gave a rather weak performance , however , he was just starting his career and took almost any role that he was presented with . Jimmy Stewart always was very particular about any picture that he appeared in and I can see why he liked this film . Enjoy ! !
416952	663392	51758	10.0	Susan Hayward was Fantastic	Always enjoyed most of the films that Susan Hayward appeared in and her acting was outstanding and she was a very beautiful lady of the Silver Screen . In this True to Live Story , Susan plays , Barbara Graham , ( Valley of the Dolls " , ' 67 , who loves life , having a good time and also a con-artist who does petty things . However , Barbara gets involved with some so called friends who sort of sell her down the river and her life becomes very complicated and at times very tragic . Susan Hayward holds the picture together with outstanding acting and portrays the horrible facts of life Barbara Graham had to encounter in all kinds of disappointing situations . Great film , don't miss it .
418151	663392	40865	10.0	Great Classic Film	This picture takes place during the depression in New York City's Hell Kitchen which ran along 10th Avenue and the living condition were not favorable during this period of time in the 1930's . Margaret O'Brien plays the role as Flavia Mills a little girl about the age of eight years old and is a very happy little girl who lives in a world of her own and is a great joy to all the people in the neighborhood . Angela Lansbury , ( Susan Bratten ) is Flavia's aunt and she plans to get married to Steve Abbutt , ( George Murphy ) . However , Steve has been away in prison for eighteen months and has kept it a secret from Flavia , who believes he went around the world . Flavia's make believe world starts crumbing as she gets older and she becomes very disillusion about what her family tells her . Margaret O'Brien gave an outstanding performance and her great acting abilities will make you reach for a box of tissues . This is another Christmas story which was great entertainment in 1948 and is a great film you don't want to miss .
416778	663392	63747	10.0	Another Tony Anthony Film	Enjoyed the first film with Tony Anthony , " A Strange in Town " and this film is quite similar except there are women being raped and one shot dead while trying to hang out her laundry . There are a whole gang of laughing bandits who simply love to tease , torture and kill in cold blood . The Strange meets up with a rather crazy preacher who has all kinds of secrets to help the Stranger fight off this gang of bandits who are after a gold shipment and the Stranger assumes the identify of a murdered postal inspector . The Stranger is captured and given a good beating and was pulled by a rope behind a stagecoach and was then kicked and punched in the face constantly . The music in this picture added a great deal of sound effects throughout the entire film and I must say some of the gals in this picture were very good looking and sexy .
416608	663392	231441	10.0	Don't Make Yourself a PIN CUSHION !	Horror films are a big interest to me and I enjoy them very much . However , this film made me very nervous and some what upset , I actually had to look away from the screen . Kimberlee Peterson , ( Dawn Cottrell ) , " Farewell My Love " , ' 01 , gave a great performance as a very very disturbed young gal in high school and having problems trying to adjust . A great deal of her problems were found in her own family and the way her Mom & Dad and step brother treated her . Dawn was on a stairway in the boiler room of the high school and was jamming something in her leg and at first I thought it was a needle for drugs , but later found out it was a big gash in her leg . This film clearly shows a new illness that has come to pass in our Society that needs the attention of all parents and students . It is a very hard film to watch , but very down to earth and quite possibly helpful to anyone having these Horrible Problems . Please don't make yourself a Pin Cushion , GET HELP ! ! !
416920	663392	59630	10.0	About a Girl Nynphomaniac	This story starts off with a young girl named Grace Caldwell Tate , ( Suzanne Pleshette ) who is attacked and forcefully raped and does not report the matter but assumes this is a normal procedure between a girl and boy . Grace begins to have other encounters with men and causes all kinds of problems in her home and mostly her mother and brother . Jack Hollister , ( Peter Graves ) married Grace and they have a little boy and Grace continues to have an affair with Roger Bannon , ( Ben Gazzara ) and this film continues to go on with Grace never able to say a simple word like " NO " , and leave " Me Alone " . This is a mental sickness that can be corrected , but the person involved suffers horrible consequences . Great acting by Suzanne Pleshette and the entire cast . This is a very sad story and these type of people need help .
416096	663392	482525	10.0	Sex is Powerful	Enjoyed this film because it deals with a subject that can destroy peoples lives and their marriages and also relationship's between the opposite sex . This film deals with a young man who has never had sex and his school buddies arrange to break his cherry . There is also a woman who is married and has a very hot lesbian relationship along with many wives cheating on husbands and having other men's children . There is also a man who has HIV positive and is spreading his pain with other women . Truly , this film shows how sex has a power to create good and evil , it all depends on the way you look at things and your own lives . The entire cast of actors gave outstanding performances and I am quite sure we will enjoy seeing them in the future years ahead .
417100	663392	110148	10.0	VAMPIRE PICTURE TOPS ALL VAMP PICS !	Viewed many vampire pictures throughout the years , and this Vampire picture portrayed the evil , lust , horror , murder and lots of blood drinking and passonate bitting with very beautiful women . Tom Cruise ( Lestat de Lioncourt ) " Minority Report " ' 02 and Brad Pitt ( Louis de Pointe du Lac ) , " Confessions of a Dangerous Mind " ' 02 both showed their great acting skills and could almost make you sick to your stomach with all the gory details . If you really want to see a fantastic VAMPIRE FILM , which will make Lugosi look meek and mild , watch this film for Halloween !
416213	663392	28691	10.0	1937 Classic Forever	It was very unusual for me to imagine that Freddie Bartholomew ( Harvey ) took the star billing on this film over Spencer Tracey , ( Manuel ) , Lionel Barrymore , ( Disko ) and Melvyn Douglas , ( Mr . Cheyne ) . Freddie Bartholomew was a young supper star and was like a young Shirley Temple who was a big star at the same period of time . Harvey plays the role as a son of Mr . Cheyne who is very rich and has very large investments in big business and has paid very little attention to his son Harvey , who is really a spoiled brat who causes all kinds of problems in his school . Harvey is expelled from his school for a few months and his father decides to take him on a cruise and it is from this point in the film which changes the entire life of Harvey and teaches him many things to make him into a better young man and turns his life entirely around . Great Masterpiece which will be applauded from generation to generations .
416592	663392	36367	10.0	Classic War Film with Great Women Actors	During WW II everyone in America joined forces to fight against Japan and Germany . This film clearly portrays the great efforts of the Military Nurses who helped the wounded and even gave their lives in order to bring Victory for the USA . Claudette Colbert , ( Lt . Janet Davidson ) , " It Happened One Night " , ' 34 , spread herself very thin trying to support the nurses and the soldiers in the hospitals . Paulette Goddard , ( Lt . Joan O'Doul ) , " Reap the Wild Wind " , ' 42 gave an outstanding supporting role while under constant bombing from the Japanese Zero planes . Veronica Lake , ( Lt . Oliva D'Arcy ) , " I Married a Witch " , 42 surprised everyone in the Nurses Unit with her great act of love and service to her country . Veronica Lake in real life had a short lived career and was not truly appreciated for her great acting abilities . This 1943 War picture clearly shows the horror of War and the results which live forever in our hearts and souls , especially the Veterans who are wounded and living in the Veteran's hospitals even TODAY .
