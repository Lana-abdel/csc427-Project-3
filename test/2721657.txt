568043	2721657	75845	3.0	What's Going On ?	( Slight Spoilers ) Running neck and neck with the ridicules " Exorcist II : the Hieratic " as the worst movie of 1977 " The Chiorboys " is about the most off-the-wall cop movie ever made that was so bad that even the book's author Joseph Wambaugh , that the movie is based on , disowned it never wanting to be mentioned in the same breath with the film . Having a bunch of beer and booze guzzling as well as mentally unstable LA police officers make complete fools of themselves is not very funny as the movie want's it's audience to think . These yo-yo's end up causing more trouble to the community as well as themselves then any gang of street thugs could possibly do and were supposed to like them ? There are a number of cops who have very serious mental hang-ups that leads to suicide and in the case of police officer Sam Lyles , Don Stroud , involuntary manslaughter but what that shows is how lax the LAPD is in allowing men with serious mental problems into it ranks . The cops in the movie " The Chiorboys " screw up almost ever assignment that their put on but what get's them in trouble is when Lyles , drunk and locked up in a police paddy wagon , goes wacko and blows away a park hustler when he tried to help him . Were shown at the beginning of the movie that Lyles has been suffering from a sever case of claustrophobia since he was in Vietnam but yet he managed to get into the LAPD where , being assigned a deadly weapon , he may very well be put in tight places where his phobia would take over his common sense . There's also the sad case of officer Baxter Slate , Perry King , who's suffering from very dark sexual hangups dealing with S & M that leads him to get involved with a dominatrix . When discovered getting his rocks off by his fellow cops Baxter begs them for help , all Baxter wanted was for them to talk to him , but is ignored which leads to him , feeling ashamed and abundant , shooting himself . With these two cases of police driven to he edge and beyond it's very hard to find anything funny in the movie that's supposed to be a police comedy / drama about the inner workings of the LAPD . Remarkably the most touching and understanding scene in the movie has to do with the uncouth and scuzzy head of the vice squad Sgt . Scuzzi , Burt Young . Talking to a young man picked up for soliciting in the park Sgt . Scuzzi takes the time to talk to him and treats the frightened 18 year-old with kindness and understanding like a father not a hardened cop on the beat . It turned out that Scuzzi letting the boy off without being booked didn't end his problems with him getting shot and killed later in the movie . Very uneven at best and mindless and offensive , to every race color and creed , at worse " The Chiorboys " totally misses the mark that it , and author Joseph Wambaugh in his book , tried to make about the pressures of being a policeman in a major US city . We get a bunch of stories of cops who are so unstable and unprofessional that they come across worse then any of the criminals in the movie and end up getting the worse of it when their ever called upon to arrest or restrain them . There's even a very disturbing scene when two of the cops Rules & Proust , Tim Mcintire & Randy Quaid , are on a roof trying to stop a woman from jumping to her death . Rules encourages instead of trying to talk her out of it where she ends up jumping to her death . The very contrive ending with officer Whalen , Charles Durning , confronting his boss Chief Deputy Riggs , Robert Webber , about him suspending some half-dozen officers , involved in the cover-up of the Lyles shooting was about as corny and unconvincing as it could get . That was supposed to be the high point in the movie that would make you forget just how silly and hare-brained it was up until then . Instead of making the movie " The Chiorboys " better it made it even worse if that at all was possible .
567967	2721657	66845	3.0	Horror Hotel	SPOILERS With a gathering of family members and servants of the late Christopher Dean , John Carradine , to hear his last will and testament they get somewhat of a surprise in that the Dean fortune , some 140 million dollars . The money is to be divided between them but only after they successfully spend a week at the Dean mansion . There seemed to have been a mix-up in the story when we later find out that it's really an overnight sleepover , not a weeks vacation , at the mansion for the guests to qualify for Dean's money since almost everyone ends up dead by sunrise . The first victim of the Dean Curse have nothing at all to do with getting and money from the departed Christopher Dean estate the local sheriff Dan Garcia , Rodolfo Acosta . Acosta has his head chopped off refrigerated and then served on a platter to a shocked group of guests . Later that evening cute little Chin Greg and Laura's , Jeff Morrow & Marry Anders , little pet pooch is found dead outside floating in the pond . The movie has all the people staying at the Dean Mansion being picked off one by one until it's revealed who the killer really is . We then have what seems to be a double-twist in the story where the original killer is suddenly killed together with two of the last remaining guest . The real killer ends up not only getting all the loot , 140 million dollars , but then ends up not having to split it with his accomplice by doing him , or her , in by giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spot . Nonsensical who done it , and haunted house , movie with a cast of such immoral and unlikable characters that even a mother , much less the audience , would have trouble liking . There's everything you can possibly think of in the move involving the selective guests that includes incest S & M sadism and of course double-dealing and back-stabbing not even counting murder . You just couldn't care less who of the guests survives to collect the Dean fortune at the end of the movie hoping against all hope then none of them do . Even the big surprise at the end isn't really that much of a surprise since the killer's identity is divulged with the film-maker having forgotten to keep his face in the shadows so you actual see who he is even before he reveals himself ! We then have a plot-twist that eliminates the killer together with a number of remaining guest just to make the movie a little more confusing then it already is . The final plot-twist , that you can see coming from as far as ten miles away , was just to show how smart the very obvious killer was which fooled almost nobody watching the movie .

Despite being offered the miracle of eternal life Laura is anything but impressed by spending the rest of her life , which would be eternal , with the creepy looking Baru who's anything but a Cary Grant or Tyrone Powers .

568489	2721657	93676	4.0	The high cost of living and low cost of dying in L .	( Some Spoilers ) Dull as dishwater slasher flick that has this deranged homeless man Harry , Darwyn Swalve , out murdering real-estate agent all over the city of L . A because of the high prices that they charge for their proprieties . Looking like an extra from a Clint Eastwood " Spaghetti Western " Harry who's been living in abandoned houses eating dog food get's very upset where his quite lifestyle as a squatter is interrupted . This happens when a number of real-estate agents invaded his space in an attempt to sell the houses , that he's staying at to their potential clients . Joseph Bottome stars in this bottom-of-the-barrel horror movie as radio talk-show host Dr . David Kelly the handsome and popular host psychologist of the KDRX survival line . DR . Kelly is being sued by the family of one of his callers , Tracy , who ended up blowing her brains out while on the air with the doc who couldn't do anything to help her survive her ordeal of taking to him . The real-estate killer gets to talk with Dr . Kelly on the air about his adventures and the police try to get the doc to get his phone number and address , by keeping him on the line , but he refuses to in order not to hurt his rating by having potential callers not call in in fear of being monitored by the LADP . Kelly also is having a hot and heavy affair with a real-estate manager and agent the busty Lisa Grant , Adrienne Barbeau , who's office of sellers are Harry's main victims in he movie . Harry also gets to murder Lisa's main competition in the housing business the chubby and outrageous Barney Resnick , Barry Hope , who threatened to put Lisa out of business by any means possible even if he has to kill her . Getting Berney alone and with his pants down Harry slices his head off while he's being entertained by one of his clients , a hooker , whom he leaves dead and hanging together with the headless Barney . The movie ends with the deranged Harry taking Lisa hostage and having Dr . Kelly try to come to her rescue only to have Det . Shapiro ( Robert Miano ) , looking like e hasn't slept in a week , pop out of nowhere and blow Harry's brains out . Harry quickly come back to life minus the gay matter between his ears and gets himself killed for the second time in the movie by being thrown from a balcony and landing on the ground as a dozen members of the LAPD , M16 cocked and ready , come on the scene . Nothing in the movie " Opean House " worked with the tension laughable to almost non-existent . Even the hot sex scenes between Dr . Kelly and Lisa didn't save the movie since there were far too few , only two , of them and and sexy Adrienne Barbeau was a bit too underexposed , with not enough light and too much clothes on , in all of them . Harry the killer in the movie was also a bit to comical to be taken seriously in trying to make a point , to Dr . Kelly on the phone and in person , about the high rents and real-estate prices in the country and how people like himself find it almost impossible to find a decent place to live in . You can sympathize with Harry's concern about the high cost of living but be very critical of him in how he crazily went on in correcting it .
568924	2721657	197750	4.0	Looney Tunes	SPOILERS " Paranoid " is a really weird movie about a fashion model Chloe , Jessica Alba , getting involved with a couple of nut-jobs in the little town of Davon on the quiet English coast . We also have Chloe getting harassed by some crazed stalker who's constantly calling her on her cell-phone and how he got Chloe's number , well you'll just have to stay to the end of the movie to find out if your still awake by then . Being set up by her boyfriend Ned , Gary Love , Chloe goes to Levens Hill Lodge in Davon for the weekend and ends up drunk and on drugs and when she comes too she finds out that all the guests at the lodge , except her , are gone . Chloe also finds that her boyfriend had more then just two timed her but that he was married to one of the guests that was with her at the lodge Eve , Gina Bellman , which hurt and greatly upset her . Stuck with nutty Stan , Lain Glen , and his burnt out wife Rachael or Ray , Jenne Tripplehorn , and Stan's creepy younger brother Gordon , Ewen Bremner , Chloe is trapped there with nowhere to go . Drugged and drunk Chloe is video-taped by Gordon having a good time with the trio and when she recovers she goes into the living room and finds a video-tape . Watching it on her TV Chole sees another party with not only Stan Gordon and Ray but also Ned with a girl drunk or doped up and partly naked . When Stan finds out that Chloe saw the tape he freaks out and in the end tries to have her murdered . I couldn't for the life of me figure out why Stan was so whacked out over a more or less harmless tape of him and his friends partying with the girl who wasn't a minor and didn't really seemed to be abused by anyone on the tape . We see her voluntarily take her clothes off and at one point on the tape she seems to have passed out . That was about the worst that happened to her and it wasn't brought out that she ended up dead injured raped or missing sometime after the tape was taken . Even if the worst did happened to her , she was found murdered all Stan had to do was destroy the tape and nobody would know if it ever existed , or if he knew or had anything to do with the girl on it ; but to kill Chloe for seeing it ! now that's crazy ! It may very well have been Stan's state of mind that was saturated with both drugs and booze over the years that may have given him this paranoid reaction and the burnt-out Ray and dopey Gordon in the end went along just to placate him . The two heroes in the movie " Paranoid " were really not what were used to seeing as heroes in films : Theresa , Mischa Barton , who was Stan and Ray's deaf mute and ping-pong playing 15 year-old daughter and Clive , Kevin Whately , a girl-watching weirdo who lived across the street from Chloe . Theresa drawing where Chloe is , the Levens Hill Lodge , and pasting a photo of her on the drawing sends it to the police . Clive who was watching Chloe with a pair of binoculars from his apartment across the street from her became alarmed when he didn't see her for days and then tracked her down to the Levens Hill Lodge where she was held hostage by Stan . Ned who supplied girls to Stan for parties and got his supply of coke from him in return got very nervous when Stan told him that Chloe had to be eliminated . In the end Ned told the police when they came to Stan's house looking for Chloe what was happening and led them to the cliffs to stop Stan and Gordon form killing her . We were told earlier in the movie that Stan was a big time rock musician a while back and I started to wonder if the heavy music did more damage to his brain then the heavy drugs that he was using in the movie . Stan also fancied himself as a big time philosopher and poet and me and those in the audience as well as those on the screen had trouble keeping a straight face and not cracking up whenever the so-called words of wisdom came flowing out of his mouth . Clive came to Chloe's rescue , together with the police , as Stan and Gordon tried to push a car with her locked up in the trunk down the cliff into the ocean . When Stan saw th cops all hell break loose as he told Gordon to distract them by not letting then hear Chloe's banging from inside the car-trunk . The not too bright Gordon dim-wittily banged against the trunk of the car like he was playing the bongo drums to drown out Choles screams ! Clive runs down and chases away both Stan and Gordon and prevents them from killing Chloe and as he's driving his car we hear the American Country & Western song " The Last Roundup " playing in the English countryside . The biggest surprise of all was saved for the end of the movie where we finally got to see who was pestering Chloe on the phone during the entire movie . That revelation only went to prove that the person wasn't who you thought he or she was but that the person was who you thought he or she wasn't .
568073	2721657	165642	4.0	Ridiculously muddled Black Sea thriller	( Some Spoilers ) Not to be taken seriously for a moment " Black Sea 213 " is so nutty that you have to like it even though it insults you sense of reality as well as intelligence . This arrogant and stuffed-up fashion photographer Gabe , Anthony Addabbo , gets the use of a Russian freighter to do his next big fashion shoot in the middle of the Black Sea . What he doesn't know is he and his troop of beautiful fashion models are being used as a cover for the ship's Captain Killick , Brion James , to smuggle high-tech weapons and a one billion dollar missile guidance system , the size of a briefcase , to an unknown world power . This is to take place off the port city of Yalta by loading the weapons on a submarine . The big mover in this deal is Dean , Timothy Bottoms , who was a fellow marine buddy of Gabe and now a big time arms smuggler who together with local Yalta gangster Pasha Lakovitz , Rubi Zack , set up the whole deal . Captain Killick who's being used to both Dean and Pasha's advantage and is to be knocked off after the deal with weapons is culminated has his own ideas to how things are to be done . Killick does in both Dean and Pasha leaving him as the only one to collect the big pay-off . Gabe who was thrown overboard and later gets back on deck together with his girlfriend model Ursula ( Jacki Lovell ) , who was also thrown overboard with him , starts a mutiny which has most of the girls gunned down . Captain Killick fleeing with his reluctant squeeze Isla ( Irina Zatolokina ) on a motorized life boat with the billion dollar missile system , packed in crate # 213 , on board expects to be picked up by the sub and get just what's coming to him . Killick has the freighter bobby-trapped to be blown to bits by a bomb he planted in it's Hull , where all the weapons and explosives are being kept , but unknown to Killick someone switched the bomb and he's the one to get blasted not those on the freighter . Everyone in the cast seemed to be either on downers or suffering from a severe case of sleep deprivation as they have trouble staying awake during the movie . Timothy Bottoms was so out of it that even when he was taking a shower with one of the gorgeous and busty models he seemed totally unconscious and unaware of the enviable , to those of us watching , position that he was in not even giving her a second look . Both Gabe and Ursula were totally unconvincing and came across as if they were forced to be in the film and wanted to get out of it even if it killed them , or they were killed off by the director , to do it . Only Brion James as Captain Killick seemed to have a good time being in " Black Sea 213 " and was about the only person who kept you , as well as the cast , from conking out and sleeping through the movie .
568748	2721657	64924	4.0	Sammy's Deathly Secret	SPOILERS In 1980 Cannon Films took an 1969 unfinished film with then unknown actor Robert De Niro called " Sam's Song " and then added in new footage , shot some ten years later , making the movie look like most of it took place in 1979 instead of 1969 , and called it " The Swap " . Robert De Niro who instead of being the kind shy sweet and sensitive young film director Sammy , who tried to get a couple of friends of his back together who were having serious marital problems , in the original film " Sam's Song " is made into the sleazy low-life porno film maker , of both straight and gay X-rated flicks , Sammy Nicoletti . Sammy is murdered at the start of the movie , when his head is bashed in by an unknown assailant , as he's sitting in his film studio in 1969 . Ten years later Sammy's older brother Vito , Anthony Charnota , is released from prison and the first thing he does is go out looking for Sammy's killer . Vito also felt guilty about Sammy's death because he promised his mom , who died due to a stroke because of the shock that Sammy's death brought on , that he would always take care and look after Sammy . Checking out all the leads Vito goes to see book publisher Erica Moore , Sybil Danning and in the flash-back sequences Jennifer Warren , who was with Sammy at a big house party that she threw at her Long Island estate . The last weekend of Sammy's life before he was murdered . Erica tells Vito that Sammy was with her and here husband Andrew , Jarred Micky , and his girlfriend Carol , Terrayne Crawford , at the estate and later on a ferry sailing off the Island . It turns out that there was a swap involved between Sammy & Carol and Erica & Andrew where Erica became romantically involved with Sammy and Andrew left Erica for Carol whom he later married . Vito Later tracks down Marge , Phylis Black , who he found out went to the cemetery every week to lay flowers at Sammy's grave . It turns out that Marge was an actress in some of Sammy's kiddie-porn films when she was 12 and 13 years-old . Together with Marge Vito slowly uncovers the reason for Sammy's murder and it had to do with him blackmailing people of wealth and power who financed his porno film career and in one case was a performer in a gay X-rated porno flick that Sammy directed . Vito hits pay-dirt when he comes across a number of films , that Sammy left to him which in them shows the person , with XXX sex acts . In one of them is the person who eventually murdered Sammy . Vito is drugged gassed kidnapped and shot during the course of the movie in his efforts to find Sammy's killer and exact justice & vengeance on him but , as it turned out , at the cost of his life . The ending of " The Swap " has almost the entire cast killed off by somehow trying to fit all the loose ends in this very uneven movie together but that makes the film even more confusing then it already was up to then . " The Swap " is a bargain-basement-type of crime movie , with organized crime implications added in it , that in many ways comes across more comical then serious . As for the dialog it's more tongue and cheek , " Hey I Can Take My Own Pants Off ! " , then anything else . The movies ending , that was so obviously forced and contrived , looked as if those making " The Swap " suddenly realized just how silly and inane it was and quickly rapped it up . This in order not to have people in the audience laughing themselves to death and having their family members sue Cannon Films for damages .
568812	2721657	131543	4.0	There's no place for him to go but down	Filmed along Yugoslavia's's Adriatic coast " Potrait of Terror " has some breathtaking scenic photography but it's story is just another madman on the lose movie . This time involving a killer who's out to get an expensive Titian painting that belonged to the 19th century Italian aristocratic Sordi family . Tony a descendant of the famed Sordi's is a wannabe great artist who feels that his great artistic talent is not appreciated by the local art connoisseurs who feel that he's anything but great . Tony's Uncle Hugo has a very valuable Titian painting in his mansion and he feels that if he gets a hold of it the painting would somehow give him magical powers . Those powers would greatly improve his painting and the appreciation of his work by the art-loving public . Tony also thinks that the possession of the Titian would have Vera come back to him after she left the overbearing and obnoxious artist for her now fiancé Danny . In steps this Professor Mauricio Aronie from the US who seems to have some connection with Tony in wanting the Titian and sure enough the painting is stolen from Uncle Hugo's place with Hugo ending up dead . It's obvious from the start that Aronie is the killer but what puzzles the police is how he got the key to get into Uncle Hugo's mansion ? since it's , and the medieval lock that it opens , a one of a kind ! Later Aronie finds out that the painting that he stole was not an original Titian but a fake and takes it out on Tony for tricking him . After a violent confrontation with Tony , off camera , we assume that he was murdered , like his Uncle Hugo , by the wild and crazy guy professor . Aronie now starts to track down Tony's friends who may know where the real Titian painting is including his now , after Vera , girlfriend Linda a local nightclub singer . Getting Linda to meet him outside a church Aronie takes out what looks like a girl scout , it looked like it couldn't penetrate the skin of an apple , pocket knife and kills Linda throwing her body in the Adriatic Sea . It later turns out that Linda did have the real Titian , that the missing Tony gave her , and gave it to Charlie the bartender at the nightclub that she worked at for safe-keeping . With the police finding Linda's body under the waves they now cut off all avenues of escape for the now on the loose murderer Aronie who's already responsible for some two or possibly three murders already and may well add a few more to his body count if he's not captured very soon . The surprise ending saved " Portrait of Terror " from being a total " Bomb " and at least made suffering through it up until the surprise ending worth while . With the killer trapped on top of a church bell tower as the police close in on him much like in the ending in Orson Wells ' 1946 Film-Noir thriller " The Stranger " .
568737	2721657	56055	4.0	The Attack of the Killer Avocado Man	Not all that bad horror , if you take it for an unintentionally comedy , film with it having a former member of the three stooges as well as the hilarious Stinky Davis of the Abbot & Costello TV show Joe Besser as a gas station attendant as well as one of the " Hands of Death's " victims . " Hand of Death " with it's star John Agar as the obsessed and crazed scientist Alax Marsh who ends up turning into what looks like a overripe avocado . Marsh runs and drives around L . A doing his best to terrorize everyone he comes in contact with but mostly leaving them in a state of total bewilderment trying to figure out just what the hell he , or it , is . Trying to perfect this nerve / hypnotic gas for the US military that would not only knock out anyone who's affected by it but turn them into obedient zombies Marsh working day and night in his out of the way desert laboratory . One day Marsh falls asleep and knocks down a bottle of the nerve agent and gets infected by it . The gas gives him the power to kill by just touching anyone . Later Marsh develops a leprosy-like appearance that even his own mother would run from . Killing everyone he as much as touches Marsh trying to hide his identity , as the killer Avocado Man , just puts on a Humphrey Bogart like trench-coat and fedora hat thinking that would be enough to fool anyone ! One of the craziest scenes in the movie is when Marsh pops into a taxi cab trying to communicate to the cabbie , Fred Korne , where he want's to go , to the beach in order to get a suntan ? The taxi driver turning around and seeing this weird and grossed-out guy isn't at all surprised or even scared at how he looks ! Is he used to picking up customers like him , looking like vine-ripe avocados , in the city's many farmers markets and fruit and vegetable stores ? Trying to contact his girlfriend Carol , Paula Raymond , so he can take her , I could only guess , to the local drive-in to see someone who looks a lot like him his screen hero " Ceature from the Balck Lagoon " . Marsh later gets to where she's hiding from him at her friends Tom Holland's , Stephen Dunne , beach-front home . As he breaks in Carol calls Tom gets the police who both come to her rescue . Marsh running along the beach and trying to take a dip into the ocean , with his heavy and bulky street cloths on , is shot dead and left floating on the waves as the movie finally comes to an end . Hard to believe that anyone would have been insane enough to take , much less pay for a movie ticket , " Hand of Death " seriously back in 1962 when it was released . " Hand of Death " looks like it must have been the final movie that was part of a quadruple feature following even the cartoons and coming attractions where by the time it came on the screen there was almost nobody left in the movie-house to watch it . Which may well have been the best thing that could have happened to the professional careers of everyone unfortunate enough to be in it .

Scott is always Trying to impress Lucinda in thinking he's always involved in some big stock deal or corporate merger . Lucinda is not stupid and can easily find out by just checking where the phone number belongs to , the bottom of the barrel Astor Hotel , that the heel is putting her on in order to fleece her out of a couple of hundred thousand dollars and then , with Charlene , check out of town like the two did a number of times to impressionable old but rich widows . It also turns out that this private detective , or private dick , named Norm , Mark Davis , is also on to what both Scott and Charlene are up to in their blackmailing Lucinda and is in turn blackmailing them in the fact that their wanted for robbing a rich Texas woman out of her life-savings . During all this Lucinda's mobster husband Gene , John Saxon , is busy getting arms and heads broken in his dealing with some very uncooperative home builders and union leaders It seems like Gene couldn't care less what Lucinda is doing behind his back as long as it doesn't interfere with his business practices . Norm starts to put the squeeze on the two blackmailing sleaze balls by first planting a bomb in their car , thats not powerful enough to kill them , just to get their attention and then somehow gets involved with Lucinda . Lucinda got so sick of being shaken down and was now ready to tell her husband the truth about her and Scott , in making her think that her lover , that very blackmailing creep Scott , is in trouble in that her husband found out about him and her and is going to have him rubbed out . Feeling that the best way to go with this , about to fall flat on it's face , shake down scheme is by playing on Lucinda's unnatural and even insane love for Scott . Norm while having a lunch rendezvous with Scott has the surprised and now ex-blackmailer , with Norm now taking over the job , get the living hell beaten out of him in full view , in Norm needing witnesses to make it look good , of some two dozen customers at a local Japanese restaurant with him being one of the persons who does the beating . Scott battered and bruised tells Lucinda that if she doesn't give the persons who worked him over the money , $100 , 000 . 00 , the next time he won't be so lucky . Lucinda not willing to part with the cash so fast and knowing form personal experience that it won't be the last time she'll hear from the blackmailers has one of her husbands hit-men , some creepy-looking guy with a beard and dark glasses named Albert , knock off the guys , including Norm , who beat Scott up . The movie then really goes off the deep end of reality when we then see Gene and the man for all seasons-like Norm , who we were just lead on to believe was killed , in a restaurant looking at a number of hot photos of his wife and Scott in bed together giving us the impression that Gene knew all about Lucindas cheating on him and that Norm was really working for him right from the start ! There's so many false deaths in " Blackmail " where we're lead to at first believe that the person , like Norm , that was killed can suddenly and without any explanation what so ever just magically comes back to life that you start to wonder to yourself if even your alive or dead by the time the movie is over . The film leads up to this unbelievable conclusion with Lucinda and Scott as well as her husband Gene and , the just who the hell is he working for anyway , private eye Norm ending up either dead or just faking it that it . This all makes you think if those involved with the movie ever bothered to even read the script and then seeing how ridicules it is would have just walk off the set and not come back unless major changes were made .

568013	2721657	107327	5.0	Too many plots and not enough story	SPOILERS Underdevloped and overdone film that has at least four different plot-lines to it and not enough time , some 90 minutes , to fully explain them . Kate Wilson , Annette O'Toole , has been living with her old and infirmed mom Mrs . Wilson , Eva Marie Saint , since her husband left her without any notice and with a full closet of his dirty laundry . Working as a real-estate agent by day and changing into a red hot party-animal at night has her mom wonder if she actually does spend all her nights away from her at home , chit chatting and playing cards , with her friend Reba like Kate tell her that she does . One afternoon after work Kate , all dressed up to kill , is involved in a minor traffic accident with Betty Carlson and tow-truck driver Gary Smith aka Grafton just happens to come along to fix Betty's flat tire . From hearing them talk Gary finds that they both know each other from the Red Oak Inn . Gary turned on by Betty later sneaks into her house and after trying to rape her knocks her against the bathroom tub killing her . Gary paranoid that he'd be caught , because Kate saw him , is now on a mission to track her down and keep her from permanently talking to the police or anyone else . The movie also tried to cover Kate's relationship with her mom and her pick-ups or boyfriends that she had at the Red Oak Inn . Were given glimpses of Kate's childhood and the circumstances of her baby brother , Lawrence , death that her mom held Kate responsible for . There's also the suicide of her Mrs . Wilson's husband Burton who kill himself shortly after Lawrence's died . On top of all that there's the fact that Gary is a good husband and father but has this hang up with young women who's only way of showing them any affection is by beating their brains out . You put all this together in the movie with two detectives on the case of Betty Carlson's murder who , or at least one of them , acted towards old and sick Mrs . Wilson as if she were a captured Al-Qeada terrorist ! That by the time it was over you had no idea just what it was trying to tell you ? Was there a serial murder on the loose in the town of Santa Rosa ? We were told that earlier in the film but Gary's killing of Betty came later in the movie and for all intents and purposes it was his first , and only , killing and it was also not planned by him but something that went terribly wrong on his part . We also saw later in the film Gary not being able to murder Kate because he just didn't have it in him . So why were we given this red herring about a serial killer / rapist when he never was there in the first place ? There was also a hint in the film of Kate having a lover that she frequently met at the Red Oak Inn . But later , like with Gary , it really didn't pan out since Kate never gave him her real name and was having affairs on the side with other men she met there at the same time she was seeing him .

Ian Lazzare , John Savage , can't keep her out of his mind even after re-marrying a woman who's an exact replica of Wendy Teresa also Candice Daly with her blond hair colored black . Becoming a hopeless alcoholic Dr . Lazarre drinking become so acute that Teresa leaves him and that leads to Dr . Lazarre attempting to kill himself . Committed to the Blackhurst Instatute by Teresa and Dr . Lazarre's friend and personal lawyer John McNamra , Eric Pierpoint , Dr . Lazarre is put on drugs and kept from getting any sleep to shock him out of his drinking problems . But as we , and Dr . Lazare , also see his treatment has nothing at all to do with curing him but experimenting with his mind , or what's left of it , to see what make him tick with the experiments being conducted by the head of the institute the weird Dr . Vernon Requist , Malcolm McDowell . You have trouble with understanding the movie " Where Truth Lies " right from the start with Wendy's accident that later in the film turns out to be her murder . There's also this convict was treated by Dr . Lazarr who seemed to have later been executed a Jonas Keller , Denis Forest , who keeps popping up in the movie as if he were Dr . Lazarre's conscience or alter-ego . You at first think that Keller was the real reason for Wendy's death but it turns out that he had nothing to do with it so why is he made to be so important in the film not only in regard to Wendy's murder but to Dr . Lazarre himself ? At the Blackhurst Institute were at first given the impression that Dr . Renquist and his head nurse Racquel Cambers , Kim Cattrall , are not what they seem to be . It's even indicted that Nurse Chambers is a junkie that Dr . Renquist experimented with like he's doing with Dr . Lzarre . But as the movie moves to it's surprising conclusion it obvious that all that information we get from the movie makers of " Where truth Lies " are red herrings to throw us off what's really going on and why Dr . Lazarre was committed in the institute in the first place . The big surprise in the movie is not that surprising at all since we get a good idea to who's behind Dr . Lazarre's interment and what the reasons are for it is . Which Dr . Lazarre himself realizes but after it's too late for him to stop the person from murdering his second wife Teresa like he did his first wife Wendy . Very depressing ending where the killer gets poor Dr . Lazarre implicated in Wendy's murder only after he himself is killed by an outraged Dr . Lazarre , who earlier escaped from the Blackhurst institute , only to end up being committed for life to a mental hospital for the criminally insane . Passable thriller with John Savage doing his best as a man being driven over the edge in order to cure him of an mental illness that he only got from being institutionalized to cure it when he didn't have it in the first place .
568926	2721657	139029	5.0	Armstrong strong-arming the mob in a weak action film	SPOILERS The Russian and US Mafia's get together in the movie " Armstrong " in an alliance to take over the new Russian Nuclear Agency . The two gangster organizations plan to sell the dangerous and deadly nuclear weapons to the highest bidders who for the most part are terrorist-type groups in the Middle-East and Africa who have the millions to buy them . Bob Zorkin , Charles Naper , a former Navy Seal instructor is sent by the US government on a secret mission to Russia using the cover as an American tourist . Zorkin's job is to find out and report back to his bosses in the US Pentagon and State Department who's involved in the Russian government and military in dealing with both the Russian & US Mafia . Told that if the Russian government can't stop the gangsters , American & Russians , from selling the nuclear material It's his job to use his skills as a Navy Seal to take them out . Zorkin and his wife Susan , Kimberley Kates , are followed to Moscow by two mobsters from the US Ponytail & his bumbling assistant Eric , Joe Lara & Igor Porshev . Bob then goes to the hotel room where Rod Armstrong , Frank Zagarino , a former student and good friend of Zorkin is staying at . Armstrong is training the Russian secret service in the art of modern combat methods that he learned from Zorkin with the Navy Seals . Before you know it Zorkin is killed and later his wife Susan is kidnapped by the US / Russian Mob . The murder and kidnapping of Bob and Susan gives Armstrong the opportunity to show his stuff in taking on the two mob organizations and at the same time saving the world , or the city of Moscow , from nuclear annihilation . The two mob organizations , US Mafia & Russian , are trying to find out from Susan why her husband was in Moscow , as if they couldn't figure it out all by themselves . But the mobs main reason is to get Armstrong out of the way before he stops them from getting their hands on the nuclear weapons and also find what was on a tape that her husband Bob gave him . " Armstrong " really makes no sense at all with the US mobsters , for reasons known only to themselves , trying to trick the obviously drunk and naive Russians to get them to blow themselves up with the nuclear weapons that they were going to sell them ? The movie never takes the time to explain why ? Armstrong takes care of the both US & Russian mobs and the corrupt Russian military men single-handedly wearing a tuxedo that he had on when he attended the Russian Opera . Armstrong also saved the Russian president from being assassinated by Ponytail with his tuxedo not having as much as a tear or even a as much as a smudge of dirt on it after he took care of business . Armstrong's fight with Ponytail is also ridicules when after it looked like Armstrong killed him , by sticking a knife in his chest , Ponytail pulls it out and is even stronger and almost beats Armstrong with half of his blood supply drained out of his body . The reason for Ponytail & Co . being so eager to find the tape that Bob Zorkin gave Armstrong was also nutty when you finally saw the tape it . The tape showed what you and Ponytail and his mob cohorts should have already known . The secret tape showed that the US government was investigating the Russian / US mobs who it suspected of working with corrupt elements in the Russian Army to get their hands on Russia's nuclear weapons . Shouldn't they have know that just by Zorkin being sent to Moscow by the US State Department ? The action scenes in the movie were about the only thing worth watching , there was also a very explicit nude scene of Kimberly Kates going out of the shower , but for a plot and story that makes any sense at all , forget it .

568666	2721657	53337	5.0	Far Out	SPOILERS With the explosion of youth-oriented movies mixed with science fiction coming out of Hollywood in the 1950's with movies like teenage Werewolves Frankensteins and Zombies a movie about teenagers from outer space couldn't be that far behind . Landing in the outskirts of town a spacecraft with a number of the crew looking like they just came off the set of a beach party movie plan to release a horde of deadly Gorgans , a crustacean-like creature , that will grow to enormous sizes and devour the entire human race . Later the aliens plan to use the Gorans as lobster soup lobster salad and about a dozen lobster main course dishes to supplement their planets dwindling food supply . Derek a sensitive as well as rebellious youth , just like the teenagers in many movies made at that time , gets very upset when his fellow spaceman , Thor , shots Sparky , a cute little doggie , who was barking at him and turned the poor pup into a bag of bones . Derek is also secretly reading " The Book " , that has been banned by the Leader of his planet , and " The Book " is putting bad ideas into Derek's head of how his planet is being run . The movie tries to be a little more adult then most teenage movies released at that time with Derek more interested in saving the Earth from the deadly Gorgans then wanting to party around and drive fast sport cars and make out with the girls like you would expect him to do in most teenage movies like this one . The story is ridicules as Derek is being persuaded by his fellow teenager from outer space Thor in order to either kill him or bring him back home to the Leader . The leader we later find out is Derek's father . The scenes when Thor uses his disintegration gun to turn people and animals into skeletons and the sight of the deadly Gorgans are hilarious instead of scary as the makers of " Teenagers from Outer Space " would have wanted them to be . The ending of the movie with Derek tricking his father , the Leader , and fellow spacemen into destroying themselves with him included was all too predictable and didn't come off as good as it would have if Derek were to be left alive with his earthling girlfriend Betty and live happily ever after . You would have hoped that the heartless aliens would have seen the light by getting influenced by the loving and family oriented earthlings and thus be able to see the errors of their ways . Then they would have converted to become members of the human race , like Derek tried to do and become . But that as we all saw in the movie was sadly not to be .
568074	2721657	78989	5.0	The first of two Concord movies released in 1979	( There are some spoilers ) Cheaply made , especially in the special effects department , disaster film about a number of big and powerful businessmen trying to wreck the Concord Jet-plane industry . They plan to sabotage a number of the supersonic jets killing hundreds or passengers in the process . Released some five months before the far more expensive and much more popular " The Concord Airport " ' 79 " the movie . " Concord Affaire ' 79 " as well as " The Concord Airport ' 79 " also boasts , well not publicly , of having in it the same porno & skin-flick super-stud Richard Bolla , in the movies credits . Losing control and crashing in the Caribbean Sea off the Great Antilles Concord flight 820 goes under the waves with only one survivor being the stewardess Jean Beneyton , Mimsy Farmer . It turns out that the plane was sabotaged and the people behind it are a number of passenger plane manufactures headed by a Mr . Milland , Joesph Cotton . Theses plane manufactures feel that the supersonic jet would put them out of business . Getting a call from his estranged wife Nichol , Flamma Maglione , from her restaurant in the Antilles US reporter Moses Brody , James Franciscus , is told that there's a big story behind the crashed jet that has nothing to do with mechanical failure . Getting to the islands Moses finds out that Nicole had been murdered . Moses also finds out that two fishermen working for her , catching lobsters and shrimps , restaurant were also killed in a tragic accident . they were really run down by a speedboat belonging to local mobster Forsythe , Venantino Ventantini . Forsythe also ended up kidnapping stewardess Jean Beneyton who the fishermen tried to rescue . Moses finds that the surviving stewardess Jean Beneyton is being held hostage by the Forsythe Mob in their yacht and together with his and his wife's , the late Nicole Brody , friend on the island . George , Francisco Charles , goes scuba diving off the Antillie coast to rescue Jean and also find out what's left of the wreckage of the Concord only to have George lose his life in a shark attack . Rescuing the kidnapped stewardess Jean Moses tries to get the island police and US embassy staff to help him stop an impending explosion on another Concord jet , taking off from Caracas Venzuela headed for London . It seems that everyone in authority that he gets in contact with is so lazy or on vacation that Moses has to do all the work himself in order to prevent another Concord supersonic jet from crashing into the Atlantic Ocean . With Jeans help in knowing what was the cause of the explosion , on the plane she was on , it comes out how the sabotage of the aircraft is being planned . The saboteurs plant a crudely made acid bomb , in the food stored in kitchen area of the plane , and have it detonate when the Concord is at 50 , 000 feet . Lots of action on land with a very good car chase scene that's more of an advertisement for going on a trip to the Antilles , even though the movie was shot in a number of island's off the coast of Italy . Tension and suspense high in the air over 50 , 000 feet with Concord pilot Captain Scott , Van Johnson , piloting the damaged and burning aircraft to a safe landing as well as the striking island photography make the movie watchable . Even though the story is a bit ridicules with only Forsythe and his boys getting the wost of it . Nothing ever happening to Milland and his cohorts who were responsible for the deaths of over one hundred people . In the end it turned out that the Concord wasn't that great of a deal and all that it was cooked up to be , by it's supporters . By late 2003 it went out of business for good because most people unless they were millionaires , which wasn't enough to pay even for the planes upkeep , couldn't afford to pay the Concords exorbitant plane fare .

Touched by the horrible conditions at the local Willowy Springs-a take of on the notorious Willowbrook state school in Staten Island NY - State Hospital Harry tried to get his fellow workers at the Jolly Dream Toy Factory to chip in and give the unwanted and discarded , by their families , kids there some toys for Christmas . It's When he was laughed at and made to feel like a fool , in his wanting to give away loads of toys for free , by his bosses at the factory that something snapped in Harry's head having him go ballistic ! Besides Harry taking all the toys , from the factory , to give away as Christmas presents to the children in the city he also plans to give his Scrooge-like bosses a Christmas that they'll never forget ! Harry's rampage in the movie was motivated by those who looked at Christmas , and Santa , as nothing but a money making , not giving , time of the year . Even though he didn't like kids who didn't listen to their parents and elders and looked at dirty pictures , like Penthouse Centerfolds , Harry felt that they can be made to see he evil in their ways and be straightened in time . It was the adults who made a mockery of Christmas , and Santa Clause , that Harry really had it in for in that they should know better but don't . which in Harry's mind was unforgivable and needed to be , by him , taken care of with the utmost urgency ! Hard to take serious slasher / horror movie in that the villain , Harry Stadling , was so lovable that even when he did in his victims you just couldn't dislike him . Harry was so believable as the lovable Santa Clause that even the children of the people that he murdered looked up to him , with Harry giving them expensive presents , as if he were the real McCoy , Santa , himself ! During the entire film Harry was always on the outs with his younger brother Philip who , since they were little boys , never believed in Santa and let Harry know it in no uncertain terms . It took a while but in the end even Philip became a believer . Not that Harry proved to Philip that the legendary Santa does in fact exists but , in the final moments of the movie , that Santa is actually his own brother , Harry Stadling , in the flesh !
568398	2721657	108473	5.0	The utterly ridicules and convoluted up-beat ending buries the movie	( There are Spoilers ) The movie " The Vanishing " starts out interesting enough with couple Jeff & Diane , Kifer Sutherland & Sandra Bullock , driving in the Pacific North West on vacation where Diane later ends up missing when they stop at a highway rest-stop to get gas . Diane going into the food-mart to get bottles of beer and soda is never seen again and Jeff hysterical at her disappearance makes it his life's work to find her . It's now three years later and still no word of where she is and what happened to Diane Jeff is down and out looking like a bum when he literally drops , from lack of sleep , in a local diner having a glass of milk . The waitress Rita , Nancy Travis , at first takes a liking towards him the later falls in love with the haggard but good-looking and sensitive Jeff who she finds a place to spend the night in the back of the diner . We then learn that Jeff has been looking all over the Seattle area for Diane the last three years postings thousands of missing person posters and appearing on local TV and radio talk-shows . Pleading to anyone in the vast media audience if they have any information of Diane whereabouts . It's not a total mystery to what happened to Diane since for the first ten or so minutes of he movie we see this grinning and smiling weirdo Barney Cousins , Jeff Bidiges , at his secret cottage by the lake talking to himself and trying to memorize corny pick-up lines in Berney sharpening his ability to induce women to go into his station wagon and then have them kidnapped . We then see Barney bumbling around the store and gas station , unsuccessfully trying to pick on a woman , just before Diane disappeared . Living together Rita gets a bit upset with her new boyfriend Jeff's obsession with the now long departed Diane and Jeff , to keep Rita from leaving him , tells her that his relationship with Diane is now history . But it's Barney who now gets into the act sending Jeff a letter with information that only he and Diane knew . Barney even has Diane's car-keys that get's Jeff more interested then ever in Diane's plight but it just about destroyers his attachment with Rita . Walking out on Jeff Rita just misses running into Barney as he sneaks into and hides in their apartment in order to make Jeff an offer that he can't refuse to find out what happened to Diane . Jeff later finds Rita gone and then is confronted by the strange and what seems like sleep deprived and drugged out , you just gotta hear how this guy talks , Berney and his evidence , Diane's car-keys , to what happened to Diane . Jeff has a fit and beats and kicks Barney down three flights of stairs almost kicking out his teeth with the poor man ending up almost unconscious on the pavement . With Jeff regaining his composure and Barney getting back on his feet , minus a few teeth , he offers Jeff the opportunity of a lifetime to find out just what happened to Diane . But to find that out he'll have to take a long ride with him back to some deserted gas station outside of Seattle . The movie now begins to go off the deep end together with , if he isn't already , the insane Barney where Rita who just threw Jeff out of her life forever gets involved in finding him to the point where she puts her life on the line . As for Berney's weird obsession with Jeff it's later revealed by him that he's into some kind of secret experiment , Berney is a professor of chemistry at the local collage , that he's been conducting since he was 15 about the forces of good and evil existing in all of us . Jeff going along with Barney's strange scenario of going through what Diane's went through before she disappeared drinks a cup of spiked coffee , that Berney cooked up , that knocks Jeff out cold . When he wakes up finds himself six feet under in a coffin that Barney prepared for him ; was that what happened to Diane three years ago ? Instead of ending the movie right there with Jeff finding out what happened to Diane , like in the original and far better Dutch version of the movie " The Vanishing " , we instead have Rita coming to his rescue and battling it out with the crazy Barney . By now Barney seems to not only be nuts but also a glutton for punishment getting the hell beat out of him , not to mention the battering that he earlier took from Jeff , by the much smaller and lighter Rita . He's also tricked into letting Rita go by her blackmailing Barney into thinking that she has Barney's 13 year-old daughter Maggy , Denise Cousins . Nothing made sense including how Jeff could have possibly survived being buried for what seemed like over an hour without suffocating to death and just how did Rita know were Jeff was buried ? The camera and Rita kept focusing on Barneys muddy boots and shovel as if that was supposed to be a clue to where Jeff was buried ? Barney gets exactly what's coming to him when Jeff is dug up and comes back to life attacking Barney with a shovel splitting his face in two with Rita giving him a hand as well with a floor board over Berney's head . The movie ends with both Jeff and Rita in a Seattle restaurant negotiating a book deal about their ordeal as their served coffee , a brew that was the cause of most of their troubles , which they respectfully turn down .
568978	2721657	339537	5.0	" V " as in " Vapid "	SPOILERS Listless and confusing made or TV movie about a masked , who also seems to be wearing a scuba-diving outfit , vigilante who's out on the streets of Austin Texas taking out child abusers , in many cases their fathers , and pedophiles . When Officer Ben Simms ' , Sean Partick Flaney , wife Lori , Alaina Kalanj , is gunned down trying to protect her daughter Cassie , Emma Nicolas , from being kidnapped by registered sex offender John Cutter , Steve Krieger , he completely loses it in him going out of his way in enforcing the law when it comes to sexual predators and offenders . Instead of being given , before he kills someone in his custody , a desk job Simms is put on the case of the vigilante child sex abusers killings which he's very much , the vigilante's actions , in favor of . It's very obvious from the start that both the citizens of Austin as well members of the Austin Police Department are the least interested in capturing the vigilante in that he's cleaning up the streets of the city of dangerous sex offenders . This becomes very clear when a very reluctant Simms is given Daphne Jocelyn , Joey Lauren Adams , as his partner in finding and arresting the vigilante . Having been working in traffic court , giving out parking tickets , a major criminal case like this is usually given to a much more experienced cop who handlers homicides and kidnappings then a green rookie as well as ticket writer like Daphne is ! Which shows how unconcerned the higher ups in the police department are in catching the vigilante . Later Cutter in his trying to kidnap little Brianna , Joanne McCray , in a local park is confronted by the masked vigilante who quickly , with his expertise of the martial arts , puts him away with a cracked skull and a few broken bones . It's at Cutter's arraignment that two unexpected things happen . Simms trying to take the law into is own hands-Jack Ruby-style - and gun Cutter down on the steps of Hall of Justice is beaten to the punch by the vigilante ! The vigilante hiding on a garage roof overlooking the Hall of Justice puts a high powered bullet through Cutter-bulletproof vest and all-before Simms could even get off a single shot ! The rest of the movie has you guessing just who this vigilante is who , after icing Cutter , escaped from being captured by Simms ' partner Officer Roland , Brian MaNamara , with what seems like something , a flying teaser , straight out of Batmans's famed utility belt ! Soon the vigilante angle of the movie starts to get a bit tiring in that he's able to pick up police radio calls , from what looks like his state-of-the-art control center , that puts him a step ahead of the police who , like Officer Simms , are not at all interested in capturing him . SPOILER It's only when Simm's daughter Cassie is later kidnapped that the film , after almost putting you to sleep , again becomes interesting ! You know that Cassie's kidnapper can't be the late John Cutter who earlier murder her mom , as he unsuccessfully tried to kidnap her , so who in blazes can he be ! It takes Officer Joceyn , and the vigilante who's listening in on her radio calls , to figure out who Cassie's kidnapper is . He turns out to be someone who has very close connections to not only Simms & Joceyn but to the late John Cutter himself ! And that sets up the movies unbelievable final sequence where the mysterious vigilante's identity is reviled but also , which is far more surprising , how totally impossible , in the condition he's in , he could have pulled off what he did all throughout the entire movie !
567975	2721657	79822	5.0	I use to Haaaaaate to skate . . . Now I can't wait !	Some Spoilers With the popularity of " Saturday Night Fever " back in 1977 the Hollywood crowd tried to cash in on the skating and disco craze that was sweeping Southern California around the same time and decided to make a movie to capitalize on it and thus the idea for " Roller Boogie " was born . But by the time that the movie was released around Christmas 1979 the disco and skating craze was just about over and the makers of " Roller Boogie " were stuck with a big turkey and it was long past Thanksgiving . Even if the disco / skating craze was in full bloom " Roller Boogie " would have still bombed out because of it's very disjointed music and skating sequences as well as it's silly story that would have been better if there was no story at all . The plot of the movie is so childish and simple that even the crowd that it was targeted for found it hard to take . Unlike " Saturday Night Fever " which besides the great musical score and exciting dance numbers was also a top notch drama about a young man coming of age and seeing that his future was more then just discoing the night , as well as his life , away . And after a number of trials and tribulations left his disco and partying environment to face the real world at the end of the movie . But in " Roller Boogie " there's nothing even close to that in the story . Terry , Linda Blair , is a musical prodigy when it comes to plying the flute and has received a full scholarship to the prestigious Julliard School for the Preforming Arts in New York City that coming fall . But Terries real love is to Roller Boogie the day and night away down by the beach and boardwalk in Venice Calif . To make a short story long Terry falls for Bobby , Jim Bray , who besides being very cute is also the best Roller Boogier on the boardwalk . After Bobby has a few tussles with Terry , who acted as if she wasn't interested but really was , both Terry and Bobby agree to skate in the big Roller Boogie contest at the end of the summer at the Jammer's Skating Rink as a duet but only after Booby teaches Terry the ins and outs of being a successful Roller Boogier like he is . Meanwhile the mob , yeah those guys , are trying to muscle in the Roller Boogie rink Jammer's and convert it into a big shopping mall and they finally get it's owner Jammer Delany , Sean McCory , to sell it to them after threatening to blow his brains out and burn down the rink , those mobsters always have to spoil everyone's fun . With everything that can go wrong going wrong against the Roller Boogiers , even Terries father who she ask for help turned out to be the lawyer for the mobsters front company who is to build the shopping mall , it looks like their dreams of Roller Boogieing is about to come to a sad end . But then , just like magic , before you can say Roll la ' Boogie the Roller Boogiers come up with an audio tape of the mobsters shaking down Jammer Delany to sell them his roller rink that one of the Roller Boogiers taped without knowing about it , that figures , and with that tape as evidence the gig is up for the mobsters , or so we thought . But not after the customary , that movies like this that have no real story to carry themselves through the ninety or so minutes on the screen , chase scene up and down the streets and boardwalk of Venice with the mobsters getting pelted by the Roller Boogiers with truckload after truckload of fruits and veggies . The mobsters have guns and do pull them out from time to time during the movie and even point them threateningly but for some strange and unexplained reason never used them ? The chase finally ends at the Jammer's Skating Rink with the cops , mobsters , Roller Boogiers and everyone else in the movie in attendance there . And then one of the Roller Boogiers sneaks into the Jammer's sound room and plays the very incriminating tape to a stunned and shocked audience where it's heard by everyone there over the PA sound system of the mobsters threatening Jammer Delany with violence if he didn't give in to their demands . With that the mobsters goose is cooked and not only do they lose their bid to get the Jammer's Skating Rink but are arrested by the police and led away to be indited and tried for criminal extortion . With all the evidence against them the mobsters would be better served if they threw themselves on the mercy of the court hoping that they would get just a long prison sentence instead of being forced to be in another Roller Boogie movie . Now happily with everything back to normal and the big Roller Boogie contest free to be held with the Roller Boogieing pair of Bobby and Terry competing you don't have to be a real genius to figure out who won the great event . An awful film that would have better served everyone involved with it if it was just left in the can and quietly forgotten about then it being released to the public and ending up embarrassing those who were in it as well as those who made it . The only reason one can have for watching " Roller Boogie " is to see Linda Blair in her tight and sexy outfits almost bursting from the seams against her very impressive and ample body . The movie " Roller Boogie " is almost impossible to find on VHS , I don't think that it's been re-issued for over twenty years , or seen on cable-TV and you can forget about ever seeing it on DVD . As far as I know the movie negative was deep sixth in the Pacific Ocean . It seems that everybody involved in the movie " Roller Boogie " would like to have it expunged from their memories like one would want to forget a very very bad dream .
568732	2721657	61497	5.0	A case of mistaken identity	( There are Spoilers ) Almost getting hanged at the start of the movie for being mistaken for his kill crazy brother Notah White / Comanche half-breed Johnny Moon , William Shatner playing a duel role , has just about had it and decides to ride into Comanche territory , Johnny wants to challenge Notah to a duel and finally get it over with by either killing Notah so he won't commit any more crimes that he's , Johnny , been unjustifiably accused off .

Johnny coming to the rescue gunned down two of the General's men who were about to hang one of Grimes work-hands Ellis , Vincent Roca . Ellis was fooling around with territorial markers on the General's and Grimes property . Getting into Rio Hondo for some rest before his big showdown with Notah Johnny is first recognized by one of the General's men his younger brother Coor , Javier Maiza , as the man who gunned down his men . Kelly mistakes him for his brother Notah , which is a very common happening in the film , as the man who held up the stagecoach tries to apprehend him . Johnny has a knock down an drag out brawl with Coors whom he puts to sleep with a number of kicks and straight rights . Luckily he just misses being shot and killed by an outraged Kelly . Convincing Kelly and the town sheriff Logan , Joseph Cotton , that he's not his murderous half-breed brother Notah , the only difference between Johnny and Notah is the color their eyes , Kelly falls in love with her now mistaken rapist , the proper and gentlemanly Johnny Moon . This get's the banged up and jealous Coor a bit mad at him since he's secretly in love with her . We later in the movie again have a fight , this time with guns , between Johnny and Coor with Coor again getting the worst of it with a bullet between his eyes . The movie then degenerates into a free-for-all shoot em up between the Grimes gang and the General's staff . We get to see the entire town of Rio Hondo is depopulated of it's citizens in the process . Notah on his way to town to have it out with Johnny has his pregnant squaw White Fawn , Perla Crista , go to bat for him but ends up getting batted herself , by someone else .

Koh To came to the conclusion that he's completely out of his head and will only bring death and destruction on the Comanche nation with his insane actions . White Fawn ambushes Koh To by sticking a knife in his back and then tries to finish him off by having her horse stomp him to death . It then that Koh comes back to life and unseats the shrieking and hysterical White Fawn stabbing and killing her as he himself slowly bleed to death from the stab wound . This whole scene is accommodated with some of the wildest and ear-splitting cries and yells that , if the sound on the TV isn't turned down . The screams can easily damage and burst your eardrums . Facing off in an almost deserted Rio Hondo Johnny and Notah have it out with johnny coming out the winner . Then as the movie ends Johnny plans to marry , a crazy about him and his light brown eyes , Kelly as he leads his people the Comanches back to their reservation to life of peace and harmony with the White Man . More then worthy to be featured on the Mystery Science 3000 bad movie program " White Comanche " is undoubtedly one of the best bad movies you'll ever see . Johnny Moon is hilarious by being targeted by everyone for crimes that he didn't commit . Even a little wimpy nerd turned bounty hunter like Carter , Victor Israel , trying to kill him who in return ends up almost shooting himself , before sheriff Logan gunned him down .
568686	2721657	63662	5.0	Sweet Nothing	SPOILERS The movie " The Sweet Ride " begins with a ride on a Malibu highway where pretty actress Vickie Cartwright , Jacqeline Bisset , is dumped on the road from a speeding car and left to die or be run over and killed by the highway traffic . The Malibu police round up three persons who knew and lived together with Vickie at a beach front house owned by tennis pro Collie Randsom , Anthony Franciosa . Collie was picked up by the police together with his two room-mates surfer Danny McGuire , Michael Sarazzin , and Choo-Choo , Bob Denver , an on and off professional musician whenever he can find work . It turns out that Vickie left the trio some two weeks ago at Las Vegas when she had a big fight with her lover Danny over her secret life that she kept from him . Vickie depressed and hurt was even more hurt when Collie , who was Danny's best friend , found her alone in her hotel room and tried to make a play for her . Which showed Vickie just what a heel he is instead of the friend that she thought he was up until then . Danny finds out from him being interrogated by the police that a local biker gang , The Freaks , were seen on the Malibu beach partying last night and may have been responsible for beating and raping Vickie . Danny going with Collie to the bar where The Freaks hang out to talk to Mr . Clean . Charles Dierkop , the gangs top honcho to finds out what he knows about what happened to Vickie . Mr . Clean agrees to meets the two at a deserted warehouse but as soon as he shows up he's beaten by having his head smashed through a window and having a number of beer bottles broken over his skull . Mr . Clean tells Danny & Collie that he and his gang did have sex with Vickie on the beach last night but it wasn't rape it was Vickie herself who voluntarily conceded to have sex . Mr . Clean tells them it seemed as if she wanted to die and be killed by him and his biker gang . Mr . Clean also told Steve & Collie that Vicki was in a big house on the beach that turned out to belong to her agent or producer a guy named Bradly Caswell , Warren Stevens . Caswell may well have been abusing Vickie to the point where death was an option for her . Danny thanked Mr . Clean for the info by breaking another beer bottle over his already cracked and bleeding skull with him , after he kicked Collie out of his station-wagon , driving to the Caswell Estate . Danny has it out with Caswell as a movie of Vickie's is playing on Caswell's movie screen , this was 1968 before there were VCR or DVD's , with Caswell getting the hell beat out of him . Later Vickie , recovered and out of the hospital , breaks off her relationship with Danny with Danny leaving Collie for a job at a hardware store in Malibu . Choo-Choo also leaves Collie by getting married to his long time girlfriend Thumper , Michele Carey , as well as being drafted into the US Army . Poor and dejected Collie is left alone all by himself at his beach-front house with an unlimited supply of young and curvy beach girls for him to play with . " The Sweet ride " is an uneven film that never explains just who dropped Vickie on the highway to die as well as beat her to the point where she had a concussion and six broken ribs . Mr . Clean if you believe him said that he and his gang only had sex with Vickie and left her on the beach covered up with a blanket ; could it have been Caswell who beat and dumped Vickie on the highway ? I also couldn't understand why Vickie left Danny since he did everything to help her and she was in love with him . Why leave him now when you would think that she would need Danny more then ever ? The scene with Mr . Clean and Danny & Collie in the empty warehouse was really insane . Why would Mr . Clean meet with the two alone and end up getting his head bashed in ? When he had about twenty tough bikers who could have come to his aid stay in the bar and not at least be within earshot if anything happened to him where they would come to his rescue ? Mr . Clean also came across very sympathetic and it was both Danny & Collie , who are the good guys in the movie , who came across as vicious thugs by attacking and beating Mr . Clean when he came in good faith to talk to them . Poor Mr . Clean didn't even have a chance to open his mouth as he was brutally attacked by the two as soon as he walked into the warehouse ! The only two reasons I can give for watching " The Sweet Ride " is to see beautiful Jacqueline Bisset topless and the movie title song " The Sweet Ride " sung by the late Dusty Springfield .
568386	2721657	119084	5.0	She want's me to kill her ! That's the whole point ! The woman is completely deranged !	( There are Spoilers ) Revenge insanity and murder is the menu in the movie " The Ex " that has successful architect David Kenyon played by a John Cassavetes looking Nick Mancuso who's being stalked together with his wife Molly , Suzy Amis , and five year-old son Michael , Hamish Tildesley , by his deranged ex-wife Deldre , Yancy Butler . Deldre just released from a mental institution is now back in town to make her Ex-husband David's life as miserable as possible . Working out for hours at a time at the local gym Deldre had developed a hard as rock body and uses it not only to attract men but , after taking them up to her hotel room , to beat their heads into the bathtub wall and then drown them . David seeing that Deldre is making his life a living hell tries to talk her out of harassing him and his family David also wants Deldre to get help before she ends up killing herself together with those she feels are a threat to her , but to no avail . Deldre is hell-bent to destroy Daivd's marriage and career even if it kill her . The movie has Deldre impersonate her psychiatrist Dr . Lillian Jonas , Babs Chula , to get to Molly and her rambunctious son Michael without David knowing about it . Finding out the truth about Deldre's plan David kicks her out of his home . Later Deldre traps David in a number of very sticky situations with her attempting to jump out of her hotel window that David saves her from doing . Deldres action left her body black and blue which has her going to Molly , and the police , telling her that David attacked beat and raped her . Having a video tape of her and David involved in an S & M session while they were married Deldre uses it to prove that he's a pervert and sexual degenerate . All this has David's attorney Mr . Endicott drop the case defending him against the charges that Deldra has filed against David . Dr . Jonas realizing that her patient Deldre is completely out of control confronts her at her apartment threatening to heave Deldre sent back to the institution , that she was just released from , if she doesn't go back their voluntarily herself . This has the crazed Deldre do Dr . Jonas in by shoving her head into a water filled bathtub drowning her . Obvious and predictable ending with Deldre in her insane attempt to destroy everything that means anything to David , Molly & Michael . Later things begin to turn sour on her with Deldre and her grand master plan of destruction , that took seven year to dream up formulate and put into motion , going down in flames as the movie comes to an end . Not at all that convincing the movie " The Ex " is a bit to heavy-handed in it's theme about a woman out to get her ex-husband with him not at all that sympathetic . David was , until he met and married Molly , on the same path of self-destruction as Deldre was in his wild lifestyle of drugs sex and all night partying and drinking binges . It was that David's Ex-wife Deldre was so much worse then he was that he didn't come across so unlikable and sleazy .
568057	2721657	118615	6.0	I get sentimental when you hold me tight so come on squeeze me , but please don't tease me	SPOILERS Monster from the deep , the Amazon River , type of movie involving what seems like two giant anaconda constrictor snakes , who measure up to 40 feet each , that are on the prowl . The snakes attack a river barge with a film crew making a documentary about the mythical " People of the Mist " a tribe of natives lost to civilization for some 5 , 000 years called the Shirishama . The movie " Anaconda " starts off with what's obvious , with it's title and after the long introduction that we get , a giant anaconda attacking this radio post in the middle of the Amazon basin . The Killer snake has the person at the controls , snake poacher Danny Trejo , so terrified that after trying to hold the unseen serpent off with his hand gun , unsuccessfully , puts it to his head and pulls the trigger . Back on the barge the passengers and their skipper captain Mateo , Vincent Castellanos , start the long trip into the dark and unexplored Amazon Jungle and soon run into this weird Paraguayan river rat who's lost at sea , or in the river , Paul Sarone , Jon Voight . Up until Sarone shows up the movie seems to be going nowhere fast but as he tells the head of the documentary team Anthropologist Dr . Kale , Eric Stoltz , that he knows where to find the " People of the Mist " he's given practically cart blanch to do and go where he want's . What Sarone really wants is to sail into dangerous snake country that's been rumored to have a number of giant anacondas mating and breeding there . Sarone is obsessed with the giant anaconda , after almost being eating by one , and wants to captured one of these monsters to sell , and have displayed in the zoo of a major US city , for a cool million if not more dollars . It takes a while for the crew to realize to what Sarone is really up to but as he becomes more and more unstable and shows his true hand by getting a number of the people on the barge , including Captain Mateo , attacked and eaten by this giant anaconda it becomes obvious what Sarone is trying to do : capture with a tranquilizer dart gun the killer anaconda alive ! With The persons on board just having enough of the crazy snake obsessed Sarone they band together overpowering and then tying the lunatic up . Lost in the wilderness of the Amazon Basin , thanks to the misinformation given to them by Sarone , the new skipper Englishman Warren Westridge , Jonathan Hyde , accidentally runs the barge aground by this waterfall . Having cameraman Danny Rich , Ice Cube , and the director of the project Terrie Flores , Jennifer Lopez , together with Westbridge go out in the water to dislodge it and then sail home to the waterfront town of Manaus makes things even worse . It's then when we really get to see the giant snake go into action finishing off almost the entire crew and giving Sarone just the chance he needed by strangling , like a giant anaconda , with his legs the film projects assistant Denise Kalberg , Kari Wuhrer , who's guarding him and then make a clean getaway . During all this confusion Danny ends up killing the rampaging giant snake , with a number of basts from a rifle to it's head . Just when you think that the movie is about over , with it's star the big snake dead , another giant anaconda this one bigger and even more aggressive and deadly comes on the scene ! You just know that the snake is out looking for a good meal by the way it AGGGGH regurgitates everything that it swallows , man and beast , being that it doesn't consider them to be grade A quality includingSPOILER ALERTthe wild and crazy as well as dangerous Paul Sarone . Almost unwatchable final sequence that has the big snake have it out with both Terrie and Danny who are being held as bait by the craze Sarone , in order to trap and capture the killer snake , only to have it turn the tables on him by catching Sarone with his guard down , and using up his last tranquilizer dart . Looping Sarone with a number of giant coils the snake then snap crackle and pop the guy to death . There's two more scenes with Sarone and the snake that are so gruesome and at the same time eye opening , and also fascinating , that I just can't find any words to describe them . You'll just have to see them for yourselves and then have your stomach pumped out in order to get you back to normal ! Fairly good special effects make the snake , or snakes , look really frightening . The fact that the snakes move , in and out of the water , at lighting-like speeds makes the anacondas even more dangerous in being able to catch their pray , before even throwing their steel-like giant loops around them , and then crushing or suffocating their victims to death . Jon Voight's acting is without a doubt the highlight of the movie , eclipsing even the killer snakes . With a psycho-like grin on his face , that were told was the result of an anaconda trying to swallow him head-first , and what seems like a cheesy German accent straight out of Hogan's Heroe's Voight made every scene that he was in count . Even after Voight was dispatched by the giant anaconda towards the end of the film he still had enough left , or was it that the snake had enough of him , to make a surprise unannounced and final , it's just too much to expect for anyone to even try to think about it , guest appearance !

Tris finds out from his former partner Sam Hooker , Douglas Spencer , that he sold the valuable plates to an investment consultant in L . A named Jack Sylvester , James Todd . Going to Sylvester's office in downtown L . A Tris strikes a deal with him on getting 250 grand in fake money for 25 thousand in real money from him , saying that he can have in by the next day . Laurie who works as a cigarette girl at the Chanteclair night club knows a big spender named Johny Hackett , John Hoyt , who's ready to lay out the cash for Tris so he can share the 250 thousand in fake money . What Laurie and Trish and Sylvester don't know is that Johnny Hackett is really John Downey Federal Agent . Everything is going well until one night Laurie overhears at the club one of the costumers who recognizes Johnny as working for the Fed's . Telling Tris about Johnnys real intentions with setting up the deal in order to trap him and Sylvester . Tris instead telling Sylvester about it kidnaps Johnny and has him drive out to a deserted beach and when he tries to shoot him Johnny turns and knocks Tris out . With Tris behind bars Johnny now has to think fast to get Sylvester and the plates and his gang apprehended . Johnny then goes to Sylvester's office and tells him that Tris was caught by the police and is talking and not to answer any phone calls ; knowing that Laurie will call him and expose him to Sylvester as a Federal Agent . Johnny talks Sylvester into leaving his office and take him to his hideout where he has his counterfeit operation in order to seal the deal with the 250 thousand fake to 25 thousand real switch . Sylvester in return plans to take the real money and counterfeit plates and check out of the country to Mexico . Johnny also got in touch with the police to follow him and come to his aid when he's in danger of being found out , since he doesn't have the 25 thousand in real money to make the exchange . Laurie not being able to contact Tris , not knowing that he's in police custody , gets it touch with one of Sylvester's hoods and they both head for his hideout . Johnny taking his time counting the money he's getting in the switch gives the police and FBI time to get there and rescue him . When Laurie arrives and tells Sylvester what Johnny is really all about all hell breaks loose and just in the nick of time the police arrive . For what I still can't understand Sylvester shoots and kills Laurie and then makes a run for it along the railroad tracks outside his hideout . Getting on top of a train car Sylvester sees that he's trapped and put his hands up to give himself up but there's a live wire over his head that he doesn't see and when his hands touch it Sylvester gets electrocuted . Pretty good Film Noir movie but with one major flaw ; Why did Sylvester shoot Laurie who did nothing to set him up to be caught by the police at the end of the film and not shoot Johnny who did ? Lloyd Bridges and Barbara Payton really had sparks flying and electricity surging in all their scenes together and I guess the motto of the movie " Trapped " is " Crime does not pay ; Even in counterfeit money "
568753	2721657	78259	6.0	A descent into total madness	( Thre are Spoilers ) A movie that's incomprehensible no matter how you try to describe or explain it . " The Shout " is a film with an irrational story about a lunatic spinning a tale about his experiences from the wild Australian outback to a sleepy little town on the coast of England as he's being examined by a doctor at the mental institution that he's been incarcerated in . This happens during a game of cricket on the hospital grounds between the staff and inmates . Charles Crossley , Alan Bates , is telling his doctor Robert Graves , Tim Curry , how he developed strange and mystic powers while he was living with the aborigines for 18 years in the wild reaches of the Australian desert and perfected among other things the " Terror Shout " that can kill in an instant anyone who's near enough to hear it . Imposing himself on a naive and unsuspecting couple Anthony , John Hurt , and Rachel , Susannah York , Fielding when returning to England Crossley became the guest that just doesn't want to leave . Using what he learned from the aborigines Crossley steals one of Rachel's shoes and casts a spell on it where she becomes madly in love with him giving into his every whim and command . Even sitting at the foot of the kitchen table , like the family dog , and eating scraps that Crossley throws at her as her astounded husband Anthony watches . Crossley talking about the human soul and how it can be hidden in a tree or stone or anywhere else besides the human body and about his power to be able to affect the dreaded " Terror Shout " . Crossley then takes Anthony out into the sheep meadow , where there's no one around , and demonstrates the " Terror Shout " by telling Anthony to stuff his ears with whatever is available to him and then let's it roar . Anthony gets his brains scrambled and almost all the sheep that were in the meadow were killed by Crossleys animal-like howl . Anthony later finding the stone where Crossley's soul resides in and then breaking it that in affect breaks the hold that Crossley had on him and his wife and lands Crossley into the asylum that he is in now . Reliving his story in what looks like a hot dog or refreshment stand on the institutions park grounds it suddenly begins to rain very heavily . As the cricket game is called off some of the staff an inmates start to push the stand where Crossley and Dr . Graves are in away from the downpour . With his talk being suddenly interrupted by all this Crossley becomes very violent and agitated and starts to scream out hysterically . It's then Where Dr . Graves tells him to shout , maybe believing that it would settle him down . That turned out to be a bad mistake on the part of Dr . Graves where Crossley gives out a tremendous and ear-splitting " Terror Shout " where the stand that he and Dr . Graves are in seems to be hit by a sudden bolt of lighting with both Crossley and Dr . Graves as well as a number of staff and inmates of the institution ending up dead . The more that I watch this movie the more I get confused , just what were the writer and director trying to tell the audience ? Or was the film supposed to be a lesson of how a man can become so immersed in his detachment from reality that in the end he descends in to total madness .

Scottland worked his way up to the point where he became in charge of supplies for the German Army without the slightest suspicion of German Furuer Adolph Hitler , Kennith Griffih , and his dreaded secret police the Gestapo . After the German conquest of Poland in 1939 Scottland is promoted to general for his excellent efforts in suppling the German Military in its 34 day blitzkrieg . The Nazi blitzkrieg on Poland stunned the world who thought that the war would last some six months well into the winter of 1939 . Working behind the scenes Schottland with the help of his contact British Secret Agent Cornaz , Felix Aylmer , who poses as a inconspicuous old watchmaker gets the information back to MI5 , the British version of the CIA , that the long expected invasion of Britian , Operation Sea Lion , was called off ! Hitler and his General Staff decided instead to launch a massive 3 million man invasion of Soviet Russin the following summer . This gave the battered British Army and Navy breathing room to recover from the beating they took in the Nazis conquest of Western Europe in the spring and early summer of 1940 . Britain who was being supplied with huge amounts of much needed war material by the US , who at the time considered itself to be neutral in the war , hoped that the Soviet Red Army would do what the allies , Britian & France , were unable to since the war began ; Stop the then unstoppable Nazi Juggernaut ! As the war progresses and the Nazis start losing it becomes apparent to their high command that someone high up is giving the Allies secret information on their military planning ! That's when things start to go sour for Gen . Schottland and those whom he's secretly working with . The first shoe to drop is on Gen . Schottland secret British contact in Berlin watchmaker Cornaz . Caught red-handed , in sneaking out information to Britain , by the Gestapo Cornaz is tortured to death but keeps his mouth shut not revealing his fellow spy Gen . Schottland . Having Cornaz replaced by the British with Italian singing sensation Lili Geya , Gia Scala , doesn't help Gen , Scottland much either . Gen . Scottland , who knew Lili before the war , was too busy keeping his eyes on the beautiful Lili more then his work leading to a number of major screw-ups on his part . All that eventually leads to Lili's unfortunate death in the dying days of WWII . Lili was shot by Gen , Schottland Aid-de-camp Lt . Reinisch , Erik Schumann , who recognized her when she tried to cross over to the British lines with a secret map , provided to her by Schottland , about future German troop movements .

Schottland is so good at his work that he manages to outfox the Nazis at their own game , trickery and deception , by getting Nazi Generals loyal to the Fuhrer arrested and executed by the Gestapo for treason and disloyalty . Gen Schottland even goes so far as getting German Generals , one of them Gen Hartz played by Donald Pleasence , who are secretly in league with the allies like himself , to do in the Fuhrer , exposed and summarily executed just to keep the Gestapo from suspecting him ! I don't know if the story about Gen Schottland is real but if it is the guy made legendary British Secret Agent James Bond look like a rank armature . Always a step ahead of the Nazis Gen . Schottland seems to be the luckiest man on the face of the earth in all the escapes he makes from being caught , at the expense of his fellow British spies , that he comes across not only as being unbelievably lucky but both omnipresent and prophetic , in him knowing what the Nazis are to do ahead of time even before the Nazis do , as well ! P . S Look for an uncredited and young 25 year old Michael Cain in the movie playing a Gestapo Agent .
568509	2721657	54668	6.0	Horror of Horrors : South of the border down Mexico way	SPOILERS Horror movie released in 1962 from Mexico about a Baron Vitellus who was burned at the stake in 1661 for every crime on the book with the possible exception of speeding and running a red light since automobiles weren't around back then . At the site of his execution the Baron seeing a comet in the evening sky curses those who condemned him to death . The Baron last words is that when the comet comes back some 300 years hence he'll be back to take out his revenge on his executioners descendants . Now in Mexico City 300 years later in 1961 Baron Vitellus is back and he's back with a vengeance . Hilarious horror movie with the crazed Baron Vitellus on the loose in Mexico City and the surrounding countryside . The Baron goes out offing the offspring of those who offed him 300 years ago . The cheap and ridicules horror special effects in the film had the Baron when he was in action looking like he was waring a bad Halloween mask that was a cross between Groucho Marks and one of the dogs in the movie " The Killer Shrews " . The Baron does in his victims by sucking out the brains of his victims with what looks like a two foot fork tongue and keeping the brains in a golden punch bowel that he has locked up in his study where we occasionally see him eating them ! It seems odd that the descendants of those who had Baron Vitellus executed were all living in a area that was something like ten square miles , this three hundred later ? Did they ever think of moving all those years ? The Baron knowing everyone of his victims names and addresses had no trouble at all tracking them all down and , not knowing how else to better describe it , tongue them to dead . There are some scenes in " The Brainiac " that are really weird even for a low-budget and badly written horror flick like it is . Whenever Baron Vitellus gets ready to turn into the Brainiac and do his victims in his face lights up , like in the comic books when someone gets a bright idea and you see a light bulb blink and light up over his head . There's also two scenes in the movie when the Baron , changing into the Brainiac , goes after his victims they suddenly freeze in their tracks and their eyes seem to pop out of their heads looking like they were a pair of ping-pong balls . Baron Vitellus also has a way with the ladies in the movie , he seems to be the strong and silent type . In a scene at a bar a very attractive woman goes up to him and starts a conversation buys him a drink and is almost about to invite him to her home and undress and go to bed with him . All the Baron does is just sit there without saying a word to her and then for what seems to be no reason at all , she wasn't one of the descendants of those who did the Baron in as I could see , turns into the Brainiac and does what he did to all his victims in the movie , sucks her brains out . The Baron Vitellus / Brainiac is finally done in by the two detectives that were on the case with a pair of flame-throwers that left him looking like a mound of bones and ashes . The detectives were also the comic relief in the movie with one looking like a diminutive former Governor Jesse Ventura of Minnesota and the other looking and acting like Phil Silvers with a full head of hair .

Concocting a plan , with one of her many boyfriends , to do in the good and kind Doctor Ben Marcie has all the bases covered as she makes sure that she's nowhere near the house when Ben gets it .

Leaving her boyfriend dead , with a broken back head and neck , and herself landing behind bars for the rest of her life .

By paying for the crime , or crimes , that she committed against everyone , especially Dr . Ben Pierce together with his two daughters , in the movie .

568272	2721657	138304	6.0	Space Children	SPOILERS Outer space Rosemary's Baby-like shocker that holds together pretty well until the final few minutes when you would expect the movie to deliver the goods and only end up getting a second-rate and very confusing , or a complete let-down , surprise ending .

The killer then plans to knock him off in a coming bank robbery that the bunch of badmen at the Chuck-O-Luck planned the next day . Off-the-wall cowboy film that has a lot of hidden meanings in it , like all of Fritz Langs movies . Marlene Dietrich more or less re-creates her role in " Destry Rides Again " that she made some 13 years earlier back in 1939 but this time she's a lot more subdued and no where as frisky in her role but the movie , to it's producers credit , is in glorious color not black and white . So-so story that just doesn't take off at all but with a much better cast then you would have expected in it due to the fact that the legendary Fritz Lang directed it and it was bankrolled by Howard Hughs ' RKO studios . Altar's ranch was a favorite among the local badmen since she provided safety food and shelter for them but at the cost of 10 % of their illegal take and was making a fairly good living out of it . It seemed that the local sheriff was either totally unaware of what Altar was doing or was being paid off by her to look the other way . It was Altar falling in love with Vern to the dislike of her former lover the fugitive gunfighter Frenchy , Mel Ferrer , that caused sparks and bullets to fly and destroyed the sanctuary that she ran for so long . In the end after the usual and customary western-style shoot-out with almost everyone in the cast ending up dead it was the two lovers of Altar , Vern & Frenchy , who rode off in the sunset together forgetting their differences about the rivalry that they had over her . The movie had a very irritating and annoying theme song all through it that made it come across more funny then serious . There's also George " Superman " Reeves playing Wilson who besides being one of the bad guys was also a big ladies man in the movie .
568085	2721657	167752	6.0	There's Hell beneath your feet on the 4th Floor	Effective and original little thriller set on the island of Manhattan about a young woman terrorized in her rent-controlled apartment by unknown forces that want her out . Juliette Lewis , Jane Ehelin , is at her feisty best as the victim of this horror drama who won't let herself be driven out of her apartment as the terror below her that at first is just annoying begins to turn deadly . The movie " The 4th Floor " has a lot of false leads as to who the person or persons are that are terrorizing the hell out of Jane . If your very attentive you'll notice something almost at the beginning of the movie , that is repeated in the films final sequence , why all of this is happening to her . After her Aunt Cecile was killed from a fall down the stairs of her building it was found out in Aunt Cecile's lease that she put Jaen on it as co-occupant to her apartment . Jane was all set to move in with her boyfriend Greg Harrison , William Hurt , a local TV weatherman in the house that he just bought in the New York city suburb of Westchester County . Jaen instead canceled her plans in order to move into that empty and very affordable apartment in the city . As soon as Jaen moved in things began to happen all originating from the 4th floor , the apartment just underneath her . The director and writer of the movie " The 4th Floor " leave a lot of red herrings as well as yellow and orange maggots and white and gray mice to what is behind all this and you almost suspect everyone in the movie that Jaen comes in contact with . The ending is quite a surprise because even when it comes it still may keep you hanging as to what was the reason for tormenting Jaen and driving her almost mad and out of her brownstone apartment . The very last scene in the movie really explains it all . Besides Juliette Lewis William Hurt is very good in an unusually small but important role so are Shelley Duvall , Martha Stewart , no not the Martha Stewart in the news . There's also Austin Pendleton , Mr . Collins , as Jaen's neighbors and a very good performance by Tobin Bell the locksmith and next-door neighbor of Jean who knew a lot more to what was happening in Jane's building then what he let her on to . Tension-pack and really creepy movie that will make your skin crawl as Jaen is slowly constricted by the four walls around her as the terror , that's a lot closer to her then she thinks , closes in on her for the movies surprising as well as really weird and shocking conclusion . " The 4th Floor " is a lot better then you would , or I did , expect from many of the negative reviews that it got and is well worth seeing .
568008	2721657	155716	6.0	You People Make Me Sick !	( Some Spoilers ) Standard made for TV movie with Saturday morning cartoon special effects and a really monotonous and annoying soundtrack about a plague breaking out on a pleasure cruise luxury ocean liner , the Orion Star , on the high seas off the coast of Miami Beach . After romping through the jungles of an out of the way Caribbiean island a passenger of the ship carried aboard the Orion Star a deadly airborne infectious disease that attacks the blood system much like the deadly Ebola infection . Within hours a number of passengers and crew members come down with the deadly illness and the ship is quarantined by order of the president of the United States Brian Dennehy . It was just pure luck that one of he passengers on board is non other then Dr . Stephanie Tauber , Lindsay Wagner , a top specialist of infectious diseases at the US Goverments CDC offices in Atlanta Ga . Dr . Tauber taking control of the boat on orders of President Dennehy , to the shock and outrage of the ships captain Horst Bucholz , quickly begins to turn the luxury liner into a floating medical laboratory with a number of Navy Seals and CDC personnel coming aboard to maintain some sense of order in the mist of total panic on the part of the ships 1 , 800 passengers and crew . Back in D . C Pres . Dennehy is being manipulated by his close adviser's Henry Northcutt and his sidekick Michael , Martin Sheen & Andrew Airlie , who want this emergency to be stretched out like the 1979-81 Iranian hostage crisis in order to have Dennehy thrown out of office , like President Jimmy Carter was in 1980 , and get their guy who , like Northcutt said , will steer this country in the " RIGHT " direction . Michael who seems to be the man in charge of public relations for the White House gets these paid off hacks and snake oil salesmen , masquerading around as world renowned epidemiologists , on every talk and discussion show on TV . Telling the American public that the virus on he Orion Star is so dangerous that if anyone is allowed to leave the ship and come onshore they would infect millions of Americans . This is part of Northcutt's grandiose plan to bamboozle and terrorize the population in putting pressure on Pres . Dennehy and keep the crisis going on for months if not over a year ; thus seal his fate in the next presidential elections . Feeling helpless and abandoned the ships crew led by hot head McBride , Michael Ironside , stage a mutiny and try to take over the Orion Star and both drive and beach it ashore on Miami Beach thus freeing themselves from the governments unforced quarantine . The revolt frizzles out with McBride and a number of his mutineers shot and killed by the Navy Seals and Dr . Tauber who sent McBride off the ship the one way he didn't want to leave it ; in a rubber body-bag . There's a stroke of luck in all this chaos when Dr . Tauber discovers one of the passengers Alex Reid , Steve Bacic , who was infected with the deadly virus had miraculously recovered . Dr . Tabuer quickly had a sample of his blood sent to the CDC labs back in the states and from it a serum was developed to cure the disease and in the end save the day and the lives of the remaining passengers of the Orion Star including Dr . Taber's teenage daughter Aly , Katharine Isbelle . Decent film with a really standout performance by Martin Sheen as the creepy and back-stabbing presidential adviser Henry Northcutt who together with his " right-hand " man Michael tried to make political points , for their man in waiting , to take over the government by having hundreds of unsuspecting Americans die for what Northcutt & Michael deemed to be a high and noble cause . Sheen's Henry Northcutt is eerily similar to another low-life political swine that he played in the 1983 movie " the Dead Zone " Sen . Greg Sillson who felt that it was his destiny to get elected president of the United States in order to bring about the long awaited battle between good and evil : Armagaddon . Thank God that in this film " Voyage of Terror " , like in the movie " the Dead Zone " , Sheen's character failed miserably .

Darnell Russell , Jasmine Guy , for being the success that he isn't . Living on base as a military Dependant starts to get to Robert as he drinks himself into an ugly and violent rage that leads him to consistently brutalize Darnell to the point that she has to cover her arms from the black and blue bruises he gave her . One Sunday afternoon after Darnell came home from church services she just disappeared never to be seen again and the talk around the base is that her husband Robert murdered her . The evidence , beside the violent beating that Robert gave Darnell , is the fact that she got a court statement for him to sign for a separation and that may well have set off the very unstable and dangerous Robert . Getting on the case that at first was a missing person investigation is NIS investigator Joanne Jensen , Mitzi Kapture , who starts to put all the facts together and comes to the realization that Darnell may well have been murdered and that Robert is the one and only suspect . Robert does very little to help his case by being both arrogant and obnoxious when he's interviewed by the NIS and even goes as far as threatening Joanne about ending up the same way his wife Darnell did . It turns out that Robert has a very strange superiority complex that by being a hard as nails marine , which at the time he wasn't , and as smart as a whip that no woman has the smarts and guts to be able to get him convicted of Darnell's murder . It later turns out that Robert made a major mistake when , after he was forced to resign from the Corps , he left in the possession of the NIS a computer disk that was a blueprint to his wife's murder ! Unusual murder case with no body or murder weapon to convict the defendant but the circumstantial evidence was more that enough to get Joanne and the Federal Attorny Kenneth Rowland , Mitchall Laurance , who prosecuted the case against Robert a murder conviction , the first of it's kind in a Federal Court , without a body a weapon or a confession by the accused .

Roberts ' part is to devastate that country and force it to both come to he US for emergency aid as well as stop , which is the real reason of Roberts plan , from nationalizing it's oil wells ! An act that in effect would put the international oil companies , that Roberts is working for , out of business ! Not as far fetched as you would think since manipulating the weather is a fool proof method of causing havoc on a nations population and military establishment without , being that it's an Act of God , those doing it being blamed for it !

With the now rampaging killer storm , with the out of control electro magnetic generator guiding it , heading straight for Los angles it's up to Dr . Young to keep it from making landfall and wiping the city off the map . It's also in Gen Roberts best interest to get Dr . Young freed to do the job or else he'll have to answer for the deaths of thousands of American citizens . What Roberts is also planning is to disappeared , or have murdered , Dr . Young after he completed his mission ! Better then you would expect since we've been hit by a number of 3 4 and 5 category hurricanes , like depicted in the movie , over the last few years since the film " Storm Tracker " was released . Like were told in the movie , by non other then the deranged Gen . Roberts , that the weather can be the most effective weapon of mass destruction in history . In that its both impersonal and deathly effective at the same time . It was the very ironic fact that Gen . Roberts grandiose plan of using the weather to achieve his , and those who employ him , aims had finally been made public , by Dr . Young , that had him offed by the very people that he was working for !

The Baron is actually Count Dracula , with a British accent , who's sick and tired of having to go out at night looking for victims to suck dry for their blood in order to keep him going and in the pink . Dr . Edelman doing what he can to help the Count is unaware that he's really after his sexy assistant the beautiful Miliza Morrelle , Martha O'Driscoll , in trying to turn her into a vampire like himself . Also on Dr . Edelman's mind his his sweet and pretty but deformed hunchback nurse Nina , Jane Adams , who like himself works tirelessly to help those who can't help themselves in the doctor's medical experiments . One of those helpless souls Larry Talbot , Lon Cheney Jr , turns up at the castle but because of Dr . Edelman's heavy schedule he's told to come back later . This rejection by Dr . Edelman had Larry go crazy at the local police station . With Larry begging the police chief Insp . Holtz , Lionel Attwil , to lock him up in the clink before he kills somebody . Dr . Edelman showing up at the jail-house at the invitation of a very concerned Inspt . Holtz is shocked to see Larry turn into a wild beast , a werewolf , at the sight of the full moon .

The count did that by giving the doctor instead of taking from him a paint of his vampire blood during a mutual blood transfusion . In putting all the Universal Studio famous monsters into one movie took something away from it by spreading them too thin and not giving the monsters enough screen time to really scare you . Larry , Lon Cheney Jr , had the most meaty role of all the monsters as the famous Wolf-Man but he was cured almost as soon as he showed his canine teeth . Larry ended up spending the rest of the movie mostly in a wheel chair , recovering from his successful operation , looking and acting more like a 1960's hippie peace-nick then the wild and ferocious werwolf's the you expected him to be in the film . The big final also has the namesake of the movie Count Dracula conspicuously absent from it only having the Frankenstein Monster and Larry Talbot , who's normal and not a werewolf , having it out with each other . With the big bumbling Monster blindly and uncontrollably walking into the walls furniture and test tubes in and around the castle . Dr . Edelman by now a crazed psycho , because of the vampire blood in his system , ends up murdering both Seigfried , Ludwig Stossel , the friendly coach driver and his nurse Nina whom he promised to cure of her hunchback , before he went nuts . Dr . Edelman is then put away for good by Larry Talbot who reluctantly blasts him full of holes with his handgun ; this to a man who saved Larry's soul by in the end losing his own .
568699	2721657	102901	6.0	Why can't it just be me and not her !	( Some Spoilers ) Surprisingly effective made-for-TV murder mystery that keeps it's audience in the dark as to who the killer is until the last ten minutes or so of the movie . Even though it seems obvious to who the killer is almost from the start . Young Justine Essex , Charlotte Ross , is being influenced by stories her friend , or former best friend , Ashley , Amy Moore , is telling Justine about her boyfriend Ryan , David Lasher . David is having an affair with her now best friend Vicky , Kimberly Hopper . The three girls having a showdown , over Vicky's betrayal of Justine with her divorced mom Susan , Katey Sagal , out on a date with her old high-school flame Eric , Jamerson Parker , ends up with Vicky falling to her death in the woods . It's obvious from the start that it was both Justine and Ashley who were responsible for Vicky's death chasing her out of Justin's home to the place where she was later found dead . As the movie goes on there are things that seemed to have been overlooked by the police and the audience that shows that Vicky's death was a lot stranger and far more sinister then you would of at first thought . Making a pact with each other Ahsley and Justine swear to keep what happened the night that Vicky was killed to themselves and stick to their story that they were never there with Vicky in both Justine's home and in the the woods . The police slowly start to pick their story apart and Justine ends up , due to the overwhelming evidence against her , being indited for Vicky's murder . It's then when we start to realize there was a lot more going on with Vicky's love life then we were at first thought to believe . It's found out after the autopsy that Vicky was three months pregnant and that she kept a daily journal that kept referring to her boyfriend , and future father of her baby , simply as the letter " R " ? Was that to mean Ryan Justine's boyfriend ? Ryan confronted by Justine about his supposed affair with Vicky denies that he had nothing more to do with Vicky then just give her a kiss much less have a relationship with her that resulted in Vicky becoming pregnant . Were also told that this mysterious Mister " R " wanted Vicky to have an abortion but she refused ; could that have been the reason for her murder ? Ryan had gotten a full scholarship to college and if it were reveled that he got a girl pregnant it would have had it revoked . Could that have been the reason that he , if he did , murder Vicky ? With all the evidence of Vicky's murder pointing to Justine it seems to be an open and shut case for the local District Attorney to convict . It then comes out that Justine's mom Susan is involved romantically with the police detective on the case Eric Reilly , Jamerson Parker , and the case is thrown out of court . Still the the suspicion that Justine murdered Vicky is still fresh in the minds of the people of Clovis especially Vicky's parents Dr . Gilmore and his wife Elaine , Linda Pierce . Getting together with Ryan Justine goes out to the murder scene in the woods and finds a numbers of items that were overlooked by the police ; both Justine & Ryan find Vicky's car keys and that her body was moved some five miles from where she supposedly fell to her death . The evidence leads both Ryan and Justine to this empty cabin that was earlier discovered but somehow the evidence there overlooked by Justine and her mom Susan Essex where an audio tape was found purporting to be that of Ryan dedicating love songs to Vicky . Can it be the same Ryan that's Justine's boyfriend and who's with her alone In the woods and very possibly Vicky's murderer ? While all this is happening Justine's mom Susan Essex unknowingly comes across the real murderer of Vicky back in town which not only puts her life in danger but exposes the real and sick motive for Vicky's murder which is about as shocking a revelation as any good script writer could have dreamed up ; a real stunner .

567955	2721657	102220	6.0	Decent remake of the 1956 thriller	( There are Spoilers ) Meeting young Philadelphia collage student Dorothy Carlsson , Sean Young , at that city's municipal buildings marriage license bureau Jonathan Corliss , Matt Dillon , finds the office closed for lunch . Jonathan then talks the madly in love with him Dorothy into going up on the roof to see the sights until the office opens . Chit-chatting with Dorothy about their forthcoming marriage and what her authoritative father copper tycoon Thor Carlsson , Max Von Sydow , would do to her when he found about about it . Jonathan suddenly grabs a shocked Dorothy by her legs and shoves her off the roof and to her death below . Quickly leaving the building Jonathan drops a letter in the mailbox written by Dorothy that's supposed to be a suicide note that he had earlier tricked her into writing . We later learn that Dorothy was made pregnant by Jonathan and the thought of him marrying her with her father cutting Dorothy out of her sizable inheritance was not in his plans . This drove him to murder her in order to keep Mr . Carlsson from finding out about it which he did anyway . What we also learn in what's in Jonathan's sick and devious plans is to go to step two and get to know and romance Dortohy's twin sister Ellen , also played by Sean Young . In this way Jonathan can have her replace the deceased Dorothy as his very rich and future wife . Hitch-hiking to New York City where Ellen works as a volunteer at Castel House , a Covenant House-like shelter for the homeless , Jonathan is picked up Jay Faraday , Adam Horovitz , who we later find out he murdered and stole his identity . In no time at all Jonathan works his way into Ellen's heart getting a job at Castle House and working together with her driving around the drug and crime infested streets of mid-town Manhattan . The two volunteer workers pick up and give hope as well as finding a home for discarded homeless and drug-addicted youths . Unknown to Jonathan Ellen never believed that her sister Dorothy killed herself and with her going out on her own to solve Dorothy's death it will lead to uncovering who her real killer is ; Ellen's future husband Jonathan , now known as Jay Faraday , Corliss ! Unlike in the original " A Kiss Before Dying " in the updated version Jonathan and Ellen do get married and her finding out about him being her sister's murderer she discovers on her own . Not with the help of the ex-cop and now private investigator Dan Corelli , James Russo , whom she hired . Ellen as well as her father Thor are far more naive about her boyfriend / husband in this version of the movie then in he original with all the clues about Jonathan right in front of them . The most obvious being that Jonathan was using an assumed and stolen , from one of his murder victims , name which by not being able to find that very simple fact out was by far the biggest blunder that Thor Cralsson made in the movie . Were earlier told that Mr . Carlsson was so protective of his daughters that he had anyone who dated them investigated from head to toe . So why couldn't he find out that his future son-in-law was not only an impostor but possibly , with him assuming the name of a missing person , a murderer as well ! The ending is by far the best part of the movie far better then the ending of the 1956 version . Even though overall it was not as good as the 1956 original Jonathan gets it a lot worse here in the form of a runaway diesel locomotive ; where in the 1956 film he was only done in by an 18 wheeler .
568593	2721657	76915	6.0	This Buffalo is Mine !	SPOILERS Strange set of characters here with Wild Bill Hickok , Charles Bronson , teaming up with Oglala war chief Crazy Horse aka Worm , Will Sampson , to take on the great White Buffalo . The White Buffalo has been haunting Wild Bill's dreams for over a year and the only way he can finally put his nightmares to an end is to hunt down and kill the beast . Traveling to the Black Hills of South Dakota in the mining town of Cheyenne Wild Bill , wearing a pair of cool looking shades , uses the name James Otis so no one would recognize him . It seems that Wild Bill has made enemies with almost everyone in town who , if they knew he was there , would blow him away the first chance that they get . Wild Bill's ridicules disguise , looking like a cross between Dr . Fu Manchu and a 1950's Greenwich village beatnik , doesn't fool anyone with him , in a series of shoot outs , ending up putting about a half dozen gunslingers into the towns Boot Hill cemetery . Finally going out into the Black Hills with about the only friend he has in town the one-eyed and Indian hating Charlie Zane , Jack Warden , Wild Bill runs into the exiled and former Ogala War Chief Crazy Horse . Crazy Horse has been kicked out of his village by his old man the original " Worm " , Chief Tug Smith , for acting like a wimp not a brave and fearless Ogala warrior . This is after the White Buffalo , the same one in Wild Bill's dreams , did a number on Crazy Horse's village killing among some dozens of Ogala's his own infant daughter ! It takes a while for Crazy Horse and Wild Bill , after each took turns in saving each others lives , to become allies in their personal war against the " Great White Buffalo " of the " Black Hills " . the movie " The White Buffalo " was a box office dud in the USA but somehow became a smash hit overseas especially in Asia and the Far East . This may have been because of Charles Brosnson's Genghis Khan-like interpretation of Wild Bill Hickok . That may have had Brsonon mistaken by the millions of Asian movie-goers for a fellow Oriental . The White Buffalo itself is anything but convincing in it's rampaging throughout the film . The big white and pink eyed bison comes across looking like the mechanical bull , standing still when it was supposed to be charging , in the movies " Urban Cowboy " and " Stir Crazy " . In the end it took a lot more for Wild Bill to get his one eyed Gabby Hayes-like partner Charlie Zane from shooting his new found friend Crazy Horse aka Worm in the back then in him backing Bill up when the White Buffalo made its grand appearance ; in the films final slowdown between man and beast . The breathless photography of the scenic and snow capped Black Hills together with the movies beautiful and haunting musical score made the film " The White Buffalo " more then worth sitting through . SPOILER ALERT With the White Buffalo , finally being put down by Bill Worm & Charlie , now history Wild Bill could now go back to sleep without having nightmares about the big " Albino Bison " charging at him . One-eyed Charlie had now learned to respect the American Indian , whom he despised and hated all his life , in what Worm did in his bear handed Indian-style , with only a tomahawk , confrontation with the big white bison . And most of all " Worm " in proving with his bravery that he's fit to carry the name can go back to being called " Crazy Horse " . P . S There's no evidence that Wild Bill Hickok and Chief Crazy Horse , who were both murdered within a year of each other , ever really met during their lifetimes . What is known is that Crazy Horse was given his name by his father who was also named Crazy Horse . Being Ogala tradition to not have children named after their parents Crazy Horse senior changed his name to Worm , after naming his newborn son Crazy Horse , which he was to be known by for the remainder of his life .

The not too sharp Eve is then grabbed by Walt , who untied himself , who puts a gun to her head and now he's the one with all cards as the helpless Frank and Snooky have to give up the robbery plan in order to save Eva's life . Walt turns out to be even more brainless then the two not too bright robbers since he failed to notice that the # 3 man , Bobby , of the gang was still outside . Catching Walt from behind by surprise Bobby blasts the befuddled gas station owner away as the four take off and take Walt's bookkeeper Besty , Isabel Gillies , hostage as she just happens to come on the scene . The rest of the film has the Frank & Bobby gang drive down south robbing hardware and convenient stores whenever they needed cash for gas or food with the cops , in about a half dozen states , totally clueless to whats happening . Besty who at first resisted the robbers , and who's boyfriend in a local sheriff , later begins to suffer from the " Stockholm Syndrome " and not only gets very friendly with the highway robbers but even joins them in their adventures . It seemed that the reason for the trip down south was a plan that Bobby concocted , while behind bars , to rob this curtain bank in Texas but at the last moment he chickened out . The crooks decided to knock off this broken down grocery store run by this elderly couple ; the robbery turned out the be the last time the bunch would rob , or try to rob , anyone . The movie " One Way Out " came across a lot like a Robert Altman directed film with lots of improvisation in the acting and what seemed to be no real script at all . Most of the scenes looked like out-takes that we used to see , put in just for laughs , during the ending credits of a Burt Reynolds movie back in the 1970's and 1980's . Also the music in the movie was so load and annoying that it made it hard to follow the story , whatever it was . There was a scene at a Texas bar late in the film that had the music played so load that it drowned out all the dialog that had to do with the impending bank robbery . Not at all believable with an ending that looks totally out of place to the movie that you watched up to then . How could Snooky & Besty get away Scott-free where in the case of Besty she was actively involved in a number of robberies with the gang ! Snooky who at least didn't participate in any of the gangs crimes , and to his credit tries to talk them out of committing them , was still with them voluntarily and as a willing participant in all their shootings and hold-ups all across the American north and southwest !

SPOILERS Having been involved in bugging people for years in the surveillance business Harry Caul , Gene Hackman , has tried to detach himself from his job on snooping into other peoples business by trying to keep what he does at far away from himself as possible . Hired to do a job for the Director , Robert Duvall , in San Francisco Harry and his assistant Stan , John Cazale , have Ann & Mark , Cindy Williams & Fredrick Forrest , staked out with a number of bugging devices as well as men on the scene in this park picking up everything that the couple says . This assignment is no big deal for Harry since he's done far bigger jobs over the years making him the # 1 bugger on the west coast if not the entire country or even the world . What we at the time don't know , and are soon to find out , is that Harry has a very guilty conscience coupled with his being a very serious and observant Catholic about an event that has been burning up insides him . Harry pulled off an almost impossible spying job , that made him the legend in the spying business that he is now back in the summer of 1968 a job that cost the lives of three innocent people . Checking out the tapes on Ann and her husband Mark Harry picks up , after cleaning out the background noises , Mark saying " he'll kill us if he got the chance " and goes into a panic . Harry feels that he's somehow setting up the two to be murdered by the Director . With him already guilt-ridden over the deaths of the three people that he somehow involved in his surveillance job back in 1968 this , the possible murder of Ann & Mark , is too much for Harry's guilt-ridden soul to bare and he starts to do everything he can to stop it ; not giving over the surveillance tapes to the Director's stooge the snooty and arrogant , which makes Harry all that more determined not to to give him the tapes , Martin Stett ( Harrison Ford ) . Statt under orders from the Director to get the tapes , which Harry is to be paid $15 , 000 . 00 for , has Harry followed where his cover is easily discovered , the arrogant jerk doesn't even bother to put on a disguise , by a very observant Harry . Stett finally get's to Harry , by using someone else , at a party for fellow snooper at his loft , where Harry has all his tapes and equipment . Having invited top New York bugger Bernie Moran , Alen Garfield , who's very jealous of Harry for being the top man in the bugging business with him a very distance second and one of his lady friends Meredith , Elizabeth MacRae , Harry is at first made to look like a fool , by Bernie having him bugged without knowing it . Things got even worse with Meredith bedding Harry down in his loft as she induced Harry to spend the night with her , after everyone else left , not because Harry is so sexy and debonair but that Meredith is secretly working for the Director . As Harry is in dreamland Meredith slips out of his place with the very important tapes of Ann and Mark that Harry had hidden there . With no choice left to him Harry goes to see the Director the next day to pick up his fee for the tapes but he still has this bug up his a about what the Director has in store for Ann & Mark . Knowing where their staying , a hotel in the city , which was on the tapes he gave the director Harry checks into a room next to theirs and bugs it to keep in touch with what's to happen to them and if something bad does , which Harry suspects , he can come riding to their rescue . It turned that Harry was in a way right , but half-a backwards right , about Ann & Mark and the Director . After going through a number of wild and paranoid induced hallucinations Harry finally came to his senses with the knowledge that there indeed was a murder in the works in all this but it wasn't exactly what he thought it would be with both the victims , or victim , and the murderer , or murderers , in this whole mind-numbing scenario being in reverse ! Harry now completely out of it knowing that the murder , that he so desperately tried to prevent , was actually made possible by his misinterpreting the evidence , thus not being able to stop it , has another death , like the three back in 1968 , on his conscience . With the knowledge that he screwed everything up Harry goes back to his almost empty and spartan apartment , after he ripped out everything in it that wasn't bolted or nailed down , and tries to forget his troubles . Mindlessly plopping himself down in a corner , with the only thing that he can now relate too , and playing his beloved saxophone Harry is now disconnected from reality and his conscience . All this involvement with Ann Mark and the Director in regard to , what at first seemed like , a simple surveillance job on the part of Harry had just about driven him over the edge and left him in a state of such sever self-denial . Cut off from the world in order not to be exposed to both any human contact as well as becoming uninvolved in the wiretapping business that he's so good at doing on others , Harry in short has gone totally nuts !
568654	2721657	35860	6.0	You Dirty Sadistic Swine !	SPOILERS Almost incomprehensible plot that has to do with a Nazi spy ring in the heart of New York City masquerading around as a bunch of refugee European society blue-bloods . Emotionaly disturbed and mentally broken Jon " Kit " McKittrick , John Garfield , is back in New York after a stay at a rest home in Arizona . McKittrick is recovering from the horrors of being held prisoner for two years , in a Nazi-like prison camp , in Spain . McKittrick finds out , through an old newspaper clipping , that his old friend and NYPD cop Let . Louie Lepitino had killed himself . It was Louie who helped get Kit out of the Fascist prison camp in Spain a year earlier . Kit is now sure that Louie's tragic death wasn't an accident , it was murder . Having been captured at the end of the Spanish Civil War were Kit fought the Spanish Fascists forces of Francisco Franco Kit was put under extreme torture by his captors to find something that he hide from them before he was apprehend . Unknown to the Fascists the item is safely locked up in a secret Libson Portugal bank safe deposit box . With all the sub-plots and double-crossing in the movie " The Fallen Sparrow " you never get a handle to what these cryptic-Nazis , hiding behind the facade of Spanish and French Royality , want from the poor and mentally unbalanced Kit McKittrick . Were given information from Kit , in what looks like a drug induced stupor , that he was involved in the death of a top German general in the Spanish Civil War . This general was a close friend , and fellow 1923 Beer Hall putsch veteran , of Adolf Hitler himself . It was Hitler who then ordered the Gestapo and Nazi agents to track down every member of this anti-Fascist brigade , responsible for the German Generals death . The Gestapo and it's agents in the US were not only told have them killed but to find the brigade pennant , or official flag , which only Kit knew where it is , in the Libson's bank safe deposit box Increidably complicated and convoluted plot that you just give up on almost half way through the movie . Kits all over the place looking for this lame or club footed Nazi doctor , like the one-armed man in the TV show " The Fugitive " , who's now the Nazi agent out to get him to talk about where the pennant is and , after getting the information from Kit , then murder him . This Nazi is also the man who Kit remembers back from his time in the Spanish prison from the sounds he made when he walked , Kit never saw him . It later come out that everything that happened to Kit from the time he left Arizona to when he got to New York was all planned , ahead of time , by this group of pseudo-aristocratic Nazis themselves . Like a boat in a thick fog at sea the movie just limps along making little if any sense at all as it reaches it's totally unbelievable climax . Kit finally finds out not just who was behind the death of policemen Louie Lepitino , it turns out that Louie didn't kill himself like Kit suspected , but the murder of his close friend , and Washington insider , Ab Parker , Bruce Edwards . I thought that it was a bit egotistical of Kit to think that the German Fuhrer Adolf Hitler himself took such a deep interest in him to the point of forgoing his responsibility of conducting the German military in WWII against the allies . An obsession on Hitler's part which , if you take Kit and the movie " The Fallen Sparrow " seriously , eventually cost him the war . The relationship between Kit and mystery women Toni Donne , Maureen O'Hara , also took a great strain on your thought processing mechanisms . You never for once know just what Toni's role in this half cocked scheme as well as her involvement with these Nazis really is ? You get at least three different explanations from her in the movie just what Toni's role is in all this , none of which make any sense at all ! The Nazi spies are headed by this off-the-wall torture fixated psycho Dr . Christian Skaas , Walter Slezak . Dr . Skass brain-addled sidekick is the former , or what he thinks he is , French monarch as well as the bluest of European blue-bloods Prince Fracois De Namur played by veteran Jewish Yiddish theater actor Sam Goldenberg .

We then find out that Norman Shelly is not just an American mobster in Rome but a high placed and Senior American diplomat , Richard Russo , at the US Embessy there and has immunity from arrest as long as he's at the American compound . Even though Nico can't arrest Shelly / Russo right then and there but gives the big time hood / diplomat something to remember him by with a hard kick in the midsection . It's also reviled , like Nico suspected , that Shelly / Russo was actually in charge of the robbery gang that robbed him of his 5 million dollars which was the result of a ransom that mobster / kidnapper Shelly / Russo got a while back . This was done to have the money later laundered by the fence and returned back to him clean and unmarked . Thomas Millan as Nico styled himself after the NYPD crusading policeman Frank Serpico in the movie " Cop in Blue Jeans " . Nico had a giant poster of Al Pacino as Serpico in his shabby apartment . The girls and young women in the movie went completely Ga-Ga over him , like they would have done over the handsome and heroic Frank Serpico . Nico also has a pet white rat in the movie that he aptly named Serpico . There was also a sub-plot and love interest , for Nico , in the film involving young and pretty book publisher Signora Callani , Maria Rosaria , who's important Russian novel manuscript was stolen . Nico being a former crook before he joined the Rome police Department got the manuscript back to Signora by using his long out of practice and dormant pick-pocketing skills .

If you researched the family history of a now very prominent US political family you can't help noticing the very striking similarities of the fictional Farinpours and themselves ! Two far more striking things about those similarities is that the real political family in question was not only engaged , like the fictional Farinpours , in having business with Nazi Germany before the US was at war with that country but even during wartime ! The second and even more striking fact is that the the family , the real one not the Farinpours , was practically unknown to the American pubic when the movie " The Big Black Pill " was being filmed back in 1980 !

568890	2721657	118955	6.0	A long time ago we set some boundaries ; Don't cross them !	SPOILERS The life that the Chadways lived was anything but normal . The head of the house real estate developer Clay Chadway , Richard Crenna , seemed to take the abuse he suffered from his jealous and neurotic wife Renee , Angie Dickinson , all in stride forgiving her for every crazy and unfounded accusation that she threw at him . With the exception of Joanne , Molly Gross , Clay treated his children as if they were total strangers to him . Clay drove his son Bobby , Jeff Kizer , to become a virtual shut-in and older daughter Lisa , Christe Lynn Smith , to rarely stay at home spending most of her time , from work at the beauty salon , staying with her friends . It was when Clay was spotted by Renee at a local restaurant with her sister Ellen , Meg Foster , that all the secrets that he's been keeping from his children as well as himself came to the surface ! As if by accident Renee's suspicions of Clay having a relationship with Ellen brought out the truth about her and the circumstance of Renee's marriage to Clay . Circumstance that were too shocking for anyone , even Clay Chadway , to even try to describe ! Trying to put on an act as the caring husband and father Clay's fantasy world was soon to come crashing down on him . It was Clay's wife Renee's unfounded accusations against him that in the end had him finally lose it . Not that Clay wasn't somewhat responsible for his unfeeling treatment of his son Bobby and daughter Lisa , for some reason that would soon come out he didn't feel the same way about Joanne , he in fact was far more innocent of the acts that Renee accused him of then she was ! SPOILERIt was on one cold rainy night when Renee pulled another one of her disappearing acts on him that the by now out of patience Clay finally lost his cool ! And that in the end cost him a lot more then what Renee ended up losing ! Even though he was the heavy in the movie Clay Chadway , or Richard Crenna , was by far the most sympathetic character in the film . Clay did everything that he could to hold his both marriage and family together but the ghosts from his , and Renee's , past were just too much for him to overcome . It was in fact Renee's guilt , not Clay's , that was far more responsible for all the horrors that she suffered in life in trying to keep her past buried . P . S Look for an almost microscopic cameo appearance , and try to keep from blinking in order not to miss it , of actor Tony Musante as Mr . Lennox the Chadway family attorney . Musante's as the accused gay murderer in " The Detective " and the knife wielding subway psycho in " the Incident " , both films made within a year of each other , were two ground breaking roles that finally put stark and shocking realism into movies coming out of the then " World of make Believe " Hollywood studios .

( Some Spoilers ) Early 1950's man from space movie where in this case , it's the spaceman thats in trouble not the earthmen and women . A UFO is tracked from Point Barrow Alaska entering the earth's atmosphere traveling at some 5 , 000 MPH as it heads south some 3 , 000 miles down the Pacific coast it loses speed and crashes in the ocean off Santa Monica Calif . The local police are alerted when all the electricity around Santa Monica gets blacked-out and a number of people are found dead ; one on the beach and another , a night watchman , outside an oil field that was set on fire . It turns out that the person responsible for all this is the spaceman , who ejected from the spacecraft before it crashed , and only killed in self-defense when he thought that he was being threatened by the people in the area . A local man-hunt is on to find the killer who sheds his space outfit and turns out to be invisible but he also finds it difficult to breath the air in the earth's atmosphere . The spaceman has to get back to the local observatory where his suit and helmet are to put on in order to stay alive . Slowing suffocating the alien tries to make contact with the earthmen , with some kind of Morse Code , but to no avail . With the scientists and police trying to make contact and show the spaceman that they mean no harm a local reporter takes a photo of the alien which has it drop it's life saving helmet , due to the camera flash that excited it , and it breaks . With that the last hope to stay alive for the spaceman is gone and as he runs up to the top of the observatory , chased by the earthmen , he starts to become visible as he slowly loses his ability to breath and dies . Even though the special effects in the movie " Phatom from Space " are of the bargain basement variety the very interesting and imaginative story more then makes up for them . We see in the film that it's the alien thats the victim of the earth's environment not the earthlings being threatened by the alien's advance technology . The space alien didn't want to do the people of earth any harm , all he wanted to do was get back home to his planet , but it was the earth's atmosphere like in the movie " War of the Worlds " that in the end killed him .

With Jerry trying to get John to talk about his brothers whereabouts out of nowhere this guy jumps out of the window , Jerry runs him down it what seemed like the length of the Boston Marathon . Jerry after running down tackling and cuffing the fugitive seems to uncontrollably , like it wasn't in the script but a sudden bodily function on his part , vomits not once but twice all over the poor mans shirt . It also turned out to Jerry's embarrassment that the person Jimmy Ellis wasn't the guy , Bobby Burns , that he was after . Jerry's on pins and needles with his marriage on the rocks and his estranged wife Karen not letting him see his two kids as well as him being told to have a psychiatric examination by an LAPD assigned shrink to see if he's fit for duty . Christmas night Jerry attends a policeman single's party and meets and spends the night at his pad with Linda who he later finds out to his surprise and shock was the wife , estranged but still married to , of Officer Gary Kimble who was shot just the day before ! how much can one man take without going off his rocker ! It seemed that the person involved with the shootings in LA went west to Cottonwood Arizona and , together with his friends , shot up a bar robbing and killing everyone in it . That incident has Jerry put back on the case and sent to Arizona to help , the Cottonwood police , in finding the killers . With the help of the local Cottonwood sheriff Jerry tracks down the killers to this farm and after a violent shootout the trio get away . Checking the farm house Jerry finds that the three fugitives left behind a map and letters about a big Neo-Nazi meeting to be held at a place called the Shelby Ranch in Colorado where the three are headed for . As you would expect nobody takes Jerry seriously since he's such a flake even though he has the evidence , the map and the letters , right in his hands . Even the local FBI man Arthur Kressler assigned to the murder case , since the murders crossed state lines , treats Jerry like he was a conspiracy nut , in him saying that the Neo-Nazis were planing to overthrow the US government , gone out of control .

Even more important it's found out who was behind the LA and Cottonwood Arizona murders , in which Officer Kimble was a victim , and what were the real and sick reasons behind them . Interesting but a bit complicated police thriller that mixes Neo-Nazis street thugs and a lot of emotional and mental instability , on both sides of the law , together in making a fairly good story . It was interesting to see a young William Forsythe as the FBI man Arthur Kressler being so goody two shoes , like a combination boy scout and altar boy , who became so upset with LAPD's Jerry Beck for as much as using off-color language to the point of almost coming to blows with him ! In almost all of his movies after " Dead Bang " Forsythe , in films like " Stone Cold " and " Out for Justice " , was anything but the stuck-up and self-righteous FBI agent Kressler that he played in the movie .

( There are Spoilers ) Even though he's hardly on the screen for the first half hour or so Victor McLaglen as the sensitive and friendly bartender Gitlo is by far the glue that holds the film " Whistle Stop " together . McLaglen playing a part a lot like his Academy Award winning role of Gypo Nolan in the 1935 Classis " The Informer " is far more sympathetic as Gitlo a man with a dark and shady past , were never really informed what just it is . Gitmo is being blackmailed to work for the sleazy owner of the Flamingo House Lew Lentz , Tom Conway , as his bartender and sees just what a rat and lowlife , besides of what he's done to him , Lentz really is . Things really start to heat up in the little railroad town of Ashbury when the eye-popping gorgeous Mary , Ava Gardner , shows up after being away in the big city , Chicago , looking to make it big by getting hitched to someone with mucho money . The type of big bucks which no one in Ashbury but Lentz has . It seems that Mary's stay in Chicago wasn't as successful as she hoped it would be with her still single and , beside having an expensive mink coat , not having as much money to pay for a hotel room . Staying at the Veech House things get a bit strained when Kenny , George Raft , Molly Veech's ( Florence Bates ) older son pops in . Kenny is just what he was when Mary left him shiftless unemployed leaching off his friends and family members and doing absolutely nothing to improve his lot in life ; A real first-class loser if there ever was one . Kenny trying to be tough is really making a complete jerk of himself in that he's looked upon by everyone in town as someone who after you shake hands with him you check your fingers to see if any of them aren't missing ! It's that arrogance and bull handedness that in the end almost leads to Kenny losing his life as well as causing the death of his girlfriend , until Mary came to town , the sweet and hard working waitress at the Flaimigo House Fran , Jorja Curtright . At first trying to hit on Mary , who shares the same house with him , Kenny is deeply hurt in that she falls in love with his biggest rival in Ashbury the sneering smiling sarcastic and ho so sure of himself Lew Lentz . It when Kenny got involved with Gitlo that his life turned to mud in Gitlo trying to get him to knock off the hated , by both him and Kenny , Lew Lentz and steal his profits , $15 , 000 . 00 , form the annual fair he throws in Ashbury . luckily for both Kenny & Gitlo Mary catches on to their plans and derails them thus saving Lentz's life and Kenny & Gitlo from a date with the electric chair . Tragically it was also at the fair that Kenny broke up with Fran that lead , with her smashing head first through a wooden fence , to her death . A changed man Kenny finally does something with his life getting himself a job , on the railroad , and becoming a contributing and tax paying member of society . Kenny's turning over another leaf also get's Mary to leave Lentz and come back to him which has the scheming nightclub owner plan a knockout blow for the unsuspecting Kenny as he does it by using the naive , to what his plans are , Gitlo to pull it off . Almost forgotten , until it was released on DVD , gem of a movie that has everything you would want in a film noir with an outstanding performance by Victor McLaglen as well as George Raft Tom Conway and the hauntingly beautiful 23 year-old Ava Gardner . The ending which was about the only negative in the film is a bit contrived but it's McLaglen's electrifying performance in it which I feel was even better , in making up for his previous sins , then that of Gypo Nolan in " The Informer " that made it work .
568805	2721657	466909	7.0	My Son is dead , I don't know who's Son I'm raising ?	SPOILERS Better then expected re-make of the 1976 horror classic " The Omen " about the return of the Devil / Antichrist on earth in the guise of young Damien Thron , Samus-Davey Fitzpatrick , the son of Robert Thorn , Liev Schreiber , not only the US ambassador to Great Britian but the Godson of the President of the United States . Right from the start Damien was a mystery to his father Robert when in the Rome maternity ward he was told by the Catholic priest Father Spiletto , Siovannie Lombardo Radice , who had delivered him that his and his wife Kate's , Julia Stiles , newborn son died in childbirth and was replaced by another newborn who's mother died giving birth to him . Growing up in London young Damien seems to be a normal child but later when he turns five a number of strange events have his father feel that besides not really being his own Damien has a weird and almost murderous influence on those around him . At Damien's fifth birthday party two things happen that should have alerted Robert to his , secretly , adopted sons weirdness . This eerie and terrifying " Devil Dog " shows up and later becomes almost inseparable from young Damien . Damien's nanny , Amy Huck , later commits suicide by jumping off a high ledge on the Thorn house with a rope tied around her neck in an insane attempt to entertain the young boy . At the Damien birthday party is free-lance photographer Keith Jenning , David Thewlis , who after developing a number of photos that he took of the nanny finds a dark line , much like a hang rope , attached to her head . It's much later when Jenning photographs Father Brenner , Pete Postlethwait , who tried to tell Robert the truth about Damien is suddenly killed when a steel pole falls from the top of his church , during a violent thunder storm , impaling and killing him . In the photos that Jennings took of Father Brenner was a strange white line , like the pole that killed him , going straight through his body . Later at Father Brenner's apartment Robert who together with Jennings was searching the place out for clues that could explain the outlandish charges against Damien . Jennings mistakenly photographed his reflection in a mirror and sees , after he developed the film , that he like the late Father Brenner was also marked for death . Robert at first was totally against what Father Brenner told him , that his son Damien is the dreaded Antichrist of the book of Revelation . After a number of events , that the late Father Branner predicted , happened to him and Kate with Kate later mysteriously dying in her hospital room convinced him that everything about Damien that Father Brenner told him is true . Together with Jennings Robert finds the grave of Damien's true mother and Damien himself as well as a trip to the Holy Land to see the Catholic Church archaeologist Bugeohagen , Michael Gambon , which ended with Jennings tragically losing his head , like the photo of himself predicted . The truth began to dawn on Robert and that his worst fears that he kept hidden deep inside may very well be true . It was the very last doubt that Robert had about Damien's identity , being the Antichrist , the Satanicly evil birthmark 666 being somewhere on his body that finally convinced Robert with it , the mark , being discovered hidden under his hair . The 2006 horror / thriller " The Omen " follows the original almost scene by scene with a few new shocks and jolts thrown in for good measures with the only drawback , and it's a big one , being the new versions soundtrack that omits the scary and frightening Latin Satanic Chant in the 1976 movie " Hail Satan " . One really big plus in the new movie " The Omen " is Mia Farrow as the new nanny , replacing the one who killed herself , and secret and fanatical Devil worshiper Mrs . Baylock . Mia Farrow / Mrs . Baylock changes right before you eyes from a sweet and caring person into a homicidal and hysterical witch . Who's battle , together with Damien's pet Devil Dog , with Robert at the end of the movie has to be one of the most hair-raising sequences ever put into a motion picture . The new version of " The Omen " is one of the better re-makes of a previous block-buster that in some scenes , like the out of nowhere dog attack on Robert and Jenning at the cemetery , actually improves on the original .

568535	2721657	98577	7.0	A stake before dying	SPOILER ALERT Obnoxious and so full of himself yuppie literary agent Peter Lowe , Nicolas Cage , gets all that's coming to him in this both hilarious and tragic back comedy about vampires and abusive and manic depressive personality's in New York City circa 1989 . Not being wrapped too tight to begin with Peter after standing up his girlfriend Jackie , Kasi Lemmons , lets his both hair and guard down when he goes out to dance the night away at a Manhattan disco club . It just happens that Peter meets this really hot and sexy chick Rachel , Jennifer Beals , who before he can evaluate the situation , in why Rachel is so hung up on him , the two end up in bed together in his East 19th Street , what's known as Yuppieville , Manhattan bachelor pad . During a night of hot and heavy action Rachel puts the hurt , or bite , on an unsuspecting Peter that would later drive the confused young man to the brink of insanity and beyond . Peter soon starts to feel that he's been turned into a blood-sucking vampire by Rachael and starts to act accordingly . It's also during that time in Peter's work as a literary agent that he starts to take his fears and frustrations out at his loyal and hard working secretary Alva , Maria Conchita Alonso . Being the arrogant and uncouth lout that he is Peter drives the poor secretary almost to a nervous breakdown in finding this obscure short story title " Rattlesnake Hills " . The missing and very " important " short story is in fact of no importance to anyone ! Even the person , or client , whom a very concerned Peter claims so desperately wants it . Peter uses it all throughout the movie to harass and browbeat Alva to the point where she can't come to work anymore ! As Peter becomes more and more erratic he seeks help from his psychiatrist Dr . Glaser , Elizabeth Ashley , who in thinking that he's just oversexed and suffering from burn out completely overlooks the danger signs that he's giving off . Without help Peter disintegrates into his own personal hell mimicking a real life , or fictional , vampire . Peter goes so far as both eating live roaches and pigeons as well as murdering a women who foolishly at first lets him fondle her and then rejects his advances . It's Peter's abuse of poor Alva that in fact leads to his end with her car mechanic brother Emilio , Bob Lujan , coming to her aid . By then Peter was so screwed up and suicidal that a shocked Emilio , in seeing the total dump that Peter lived in , didn't need to do that much to do him it . In fact it was Peter himself who more then aided Emilio in putting himself out of his own misery . One of Nicolas Cage's best and at the same time most underrated performance . Despite the movies black comedy theme Peter was a man suffering from real and severe mental problems that drove him to both murder and suicide . It was really cruel and very unprofessional , as she liked to claim that she is , for Peter's psychiatrist Dr . Glaser to break up and laugh at his pressing problems that in fact tipped Peter over the edge . Dr . Glaser was the only hope , or life line , that Peter had left ad she failed him with flying colors .

568201	2721657	95963	7.0	I don't want this guy rolling through town like the Red Army	SPOILERS Filmed in Moscow USSR , the first US movie even filmed in what's now the former Soviet Union , and Chicago USA " Red Heat " is a lot more then the usual buddy / cops movies of those days . Where there were two cops totally incompatible with each other having , or being forced , to work together . The movie is more like a clash of political philosophies , Capitalism Vrs Communism , then anything else . We get to see Moscow police captain Ivan Danko , Governor Arnold Schwarzennegger , flex his bulging muscles when he goes into a bath-house looking for a gang of Georgain drug dealers . In no time at all Danko turns he entire place into a wild and crazy free for all taking out a number of muscle men , in and out of he bath-house . Danko gets the information that he was looking for on where the gang leader Victor Rosta , Ed O'Ross , is to be found ; in the Durzhba Café in the little Georgia section of Moscow . Later Danko and his partner Yuri Ogarkov , Oleg Vidov , confronts the Georgian drug dealers and their boss Rosta where there a a wild shootout where Yuri is killed and Rosta and a number of is gang escapes . It's later when the Moscow PD gets the news that Rosta was arrested , for a minor traffic violation , in of all places Chicago that Danko is sent to the United States to expedite him back to the Soviet Union . Danko is told by his superiors not to mentions a word to the US and Chicago law enforcement officials to what Rosta is wanted for . The Soviet leaders don't want it to get out that they , like the US , have a serious and home grown drug problem . Danko looking stiff an a bit uncomfortable at the Chicago O'Hare Airport is assigned Chicago Det . Art Ridzik , James Belushi , to show him around the city until he finally gets all the papers in order to take Rosta back to the USSR . Everything goes according to plan until Rosta is rescued , with Danko almost losing his life in the shooting , by this notorious black Chicago drug gang called the Shaveheads whom Rosta was working with . The movie then really starts to pick up with Danko now not only in trouble with the Chicago PD , for his very un-Maranda-like police tactics , but also with his Soviet police superiors for letting Rosta get away . Top rate police action thriller with Danko and Ridzik turning the city of Chicago upside down in trying to find the fugitive Rosta who's involved in a major drug deal , with the Shaveheads , that's about to go down at a city bus depot . Danko shows that he's as mentally smart as he's physically powerful by him figuring out what Rosta & Co are up to by renting Rosta's former hotel room # 302 , knowing that he left evidence of his drug dealings there . Danko wisely putting down on the hotel register a wrong number # 303 to trick Rosa and his boys who later blast into room # 303 thinking that Danko was there and ending up getting wasted by him in the resulting shootout . Rosta turns out to be as ruthless and deceptive as he ever was back in the Soviet Union . Double-crossing his allies the Shaveheads by taking the money he was to give them for the drugs that they were to supply him with . Rosta even having his American wife , that he paid $10 , 000 . 00 to marry him so he can be a US citizen , part-time aerobics instructor and full-time hooker Cat Manzetti , Gina Gershon , murdered together with one of his Georgian Confederates after he felt that they were no longer of any use to him . Danko now completely out of control with Det . Ridzik now fully supporting him , Ridzik by now saw that Danko's way of doing things was far better then that of the Chicago PD , has it out with Rosta in a mad and dangerous bus chase and demolition derby game . This wild and insane action almost causes as much damage to the city of Chicago as the great fire of 1871 did with Rosta finally being put down and out in a " High Noon " western style shootout . Just as good , if not better , as most of Arnold's more popular films it's in " Red Heat " that he finally puts it all together not just in the actions sequences but in his comical interacting with his American police partner James Belushi playing Det . Ridzik . With all the shooting and destruction over and Danko about to fly back home to Moscow he , it's traditional among departing friends he tells him , hand over his very expensive-looking watch to Ridzik who gladly give him his thinking that he got the best of the bargain . It turns out that Danko had a cheap $20 . 00 East-German made watch when Ridzik in exchange gave him and expensive $1 , 000 . 00 US / Swiss made one !

568588	2721657	356764	7.0	Hitwoman With A Heart	SPOILERS Slow moving crime / drama with Daryl Hannah as CJ March looking more like a homeless bag-lady then a professional mob hit-woman who's on the hunt for a stash of 4 kilos of dope that her victim at the beginning of the movie had switched before she could get it back to her boss the flowery Vernon , Alex Rocco . The switcher Roger , Shawn Woods , is later killed by that sweet and fun-loving couple Tony & Emily , Brad Renfor & Dominque Swain who he tried to sell the dope to . CJ March is on their tail but when she's about to knock them off she hesitates when she sees that Emily is very pregnant . This brings out CJ's maternal instincts as well as her also being knocked up by someone that she picked up at one of the sleazy bars that she patronized . One night at a bar CJ meets Rick , Eric Mablus , an ex-priest whom she rebuffs . Rick turned out to be the person in the end of the movie who turned her life around by showing CJ the light and the good things in life . During the film we also see CJ in flashback as a seven year-old girl and we get an insight to why she turned out the way she did . But the movie is so disjointed that you at one point lose perspective to whats going on well before " The Job " is over . Tony & Emily are tracked down by CJ who can't bring herself to rub them out which almost cost CJ her life . Gloomy and depressing movie with Eric Mablus as the only real light in the film as the ex-priest Rick with the heart of gold who wanted to save CJ's soul but not to cohabit with her body as CJ at first thought . The one thing about " The Job " that really struck a note was how dangerous and difficult it was for both Tony & Emily to sell the ripped-off drugs to local drug dealers who wouldn't touch their stuff with a ten-foot pole . The stash was just too hot leaving the two sitting on something like $500 , 000 . 00 of drugs and not being able to do anything with it . The ending of the film tried to be up-lifting but was so contrived that it came across as phony and insincere . In light of what happened in the movie up to then .
568936	2721657	36341	7.0	Cult of Evil	SPOILERS Being told that her older sister Jacqueline Gibson , Jean Brooks , has gone missing in the big city of New York young Mary , Kim Hunter , leaves her school / dorm in Highcliff and travels to New York's Greenwich Village to find her . At the La Sagesse cosmetic company that Jacqueline was a part owner of Mary is told by Mrs . Rudi , Mary Norton , the co-owner that Jacqueline sold her share of the company to her and then just got lost . Getting in touch with Jacqueline's attorney Gregory Ward , Hugh Beaumont , Mary is told that he has no idea at all where her sister is and then oddly asks Mary if Jacqueline ever mentioned him to her ; it turned out later that Gregory and Jacqueline were secretly married . Getting contacted by this mysterious stranger a local private eye Irving August , Lou Lubin , Mary is told that he can help her find Jacqueline . Mary who at first rebuffs him , she didn't have the $50 . 00 retainer he wanted from her , she later takes up his offer when he told her he'll work on a pay as you go basis . August does track Jacqueline down in the very La Saesse building that Mary was at the day before and ends up getting stabbed to death for it . Mary running from the building in fear of her life goes into the subway and after riding the rails for what seems like hours sees these two men enter the subway car with what looks like a drunken friend only to realize , to her shock , that he's non other then the dead Irving August . The movie slowly reveals the truth about Jacqueline and what she got into in her stay in New York and why she was marked for death , the seventh victim of a cult who had already murdered six of it's fellow members . Jacqueline had betrayed this Devil Cult , The Paladis , that she was indoctrinated into by not only marrying Gregory Ward , a non-member , but revealing it's existence to her psychiatrist Dr . Louis Judd , Tom Conway , that had him investigate and plan to write a book about it . It was also Irving August's murder that may well have the police suspect her of being a member and thus draw attention towards to secret Devil Cult . Even though the movie has almost no violence at all in it , only Irving August is killed and that happens off screen , director Mark Robson together with film-noir horror master Val Lawton's use of shadows and sounds makes the movie far more horrifying then any special effects , back then in 1943 , could have . There's one real chilling scene in " The Seventh Victim " where Mary's taking a hot shower and is suddenly and unexpectedly approached by cult member Mrs . Redi on the other side of the shower curtain , something like the shower scene in " Psycho " , but without any blood and violence . Mrs . Redi , in shadow , looks like as if she's the Devil himself telling Mary in no uncertain terms to quit her search for Jacqueline if she want's nothing bad to happen to her as well as her sister . The ending of " The Seventh Victim " is a real shocker not that there's any kind of terror blood and violence in it but that it doesn't follow the storyline that you would have expected back then when the Hayes Commission called for an upbeat ending in depressing and unnerving films like it which I feel , like many others who like the film , is the most effective and shocking scene in it .
568303	2721657	113870	7.0	In this courtroom I'm the only one who decides what is and what's not OK ! OK !	SPOILERS Highly fictitious account of the life and times of Alcatraz inmate and career criminal # Az244 Henri Young , Kevin Bacon , and his fight to put an end to the torturous dungeon , solitary confinement , where he spent most of his time while incarcerated on the " Rock " . We're given the impression that Young's only crime that in the end landed him on the " Rock " was a petty $5 . 00 robbery of a grocery store . This was in order to get food for him and his nine year-old sister Rosella , Amenda Borden , during the hight of the Great Depression . In fact Young was involved in a number of robberies and burglaries that ended with a robbery , and murder of the proprietor , of a bakery in Oregon and then followed by a failed bank robbery in Washington State . Sent to Alcatraz in 1935 to serve his time on January 13 , 1939 Young together with a number of fellow inmates made an unsuccessful escape attempt from the " Rock " where the leader of the group Arthur " Doc " Barker , Michael Melvin was gunned down and killed by the prison guards . Sent to the hole for punishment Young developed a festering hatred toward his fellow inmate who was involved with him in the failed escaped attempt Rufus McCain , David Michael Sterling . Young held McCain responsible , in his unfounded suspicion of him , for tipping off the guards in Young and his fellow inmates escape plan . Out off the hole and in with the local prison population Young , after an unsuccessful attempt earlier , attacked McCain in the prison tailor shop and stabbed him with a sank , home-made prison knife , killing him : Not in the mess-hall with a spoon like depicted in the movie . The most egregious misrepresentation in the film " Murder in the First " of Youngs stay in Alcatraz is that he was assigned a young lawyer , who just passed the state bar , to defend him in his trial for McCain's murder James Stamphill , Christian Slater . In fact the real James Stamphill was actually a fellow Alcatraz inmate who was involved , but didn't participate , in the January 13 , 1939 escape attempt with Young ! The attorney who actually successfully defended Young at his murder trial was San Francisco lawyer Sol Abrams . The film had Henri Young being tortured by the prison guards and assistant Warden Milton Glenn , Gary Oldman , day and night until he finally snaps . It's then , according to the movie , Young is let out of the hole where , in what seem like within minutes , he attacked and murdered McCain with a spoon in front of well over two hundred witnesses in the prison lunchroom . An open and shut case at first Young's court-appointed attorney James Stamphill turns the trial upside down . Stamphill puts the entire prison staff from warden Humson , Stefan Glerasch , on down on trial for inhuman treatment of prisoners instead of defending his client Henri Young for murdering one of them ! With young going from sane to insane during his trial Stamphill and his lady assistant attorney Mary McCasslin , Embeth Davitz , get Young off on an insanity conviction , involuntary manslaughter , where he's to serve just under 3 years behind bars . SPOILER ALERT Were given the information that Young deathly afraid of being sent back to the " Rock " in fact wanted to change his plea , which his lawyer Stamphill prevented him from doing , from not guilty due to his diminish mental capacity to guilty of first degree murder . Young was more then willing to risk his life , in the San Quentin gas chamber , in order not to be put back in the hole . The movie ends with the sad statement that Young was found dead three months later , were not given the cause of his death , with the word " Victory " scrawled in his cell . A final act of defiance on Youngs part to those in the prison system who so brutally abused and tried to break him . The fact is that Young never died or killed himself and was finally released from prison in 1972 some 30 years after his presumed death , in the movie , with 27 years added on to his light three year sentence , for involuntary manslaughter , due to his bad and unruly behavior behind bars . Young a free man after some 40 years behind bars then immediately broke his parole and was never seen or heard from again ! For all we know Henri Young is still around with us , he would by now if alive be 97 years old on June 11 2008 , since his death , natural or otherwise , was never reported or confirmed !

568598	2721657	383929	7.0	The Destructive Generation	( Some Spoilers ) The movie " Back August " is named after the bloodiest prison brake in the California state prison San Quentin's history . On Saturday August 21 , 1971 six people , three guards and three convicts , were slashed shot and beaten to death in an aborted break-out of San Quentin lead by career criminal and militant black activist George Jackson . Jackson himself didn't get far being shot by a prison guard sniper in his leg with the bullet somehow going , after ricocheting on impact , up the left side of his body , like that of an M-16 assault rifle , and ending up smashing into his brain killing him . We last see Jackson as the movie goes into freeze-frame laying on the ground dead with his right hand extended in a grotesque looking black power salute . The movie only covers George Jackson's short , who died at age 29 , and violent life from January 13 , 1970 to his death some 19 months later . On January 13 , 1970 on the exercise grounds of Soledad prison a fight broke out between members of the Black Guerrilla Family and White Aryan Nation . With prison tower guard O . G Miller opening fire to stop the fighting three members of the Black Guerrilla's were gunned down and killed . One was W . D Nolen a fellow inmate and close friend of Jackson who introduced the young man to radical Marxism . Three days later prison guard John V . Mills was attacked beaten and thrown to his death from a third floor catwalk in retaliation for the Soledad killings . Arrested for Mills murder ware convicts Fleeta Drumgo John Clutchette and George Jackson . The three were to later become , because of Jackson's writings , known as the Soledad Brothers . While in solitary confinement Jackson wrote a slew of letters to his mother in Oakland that soon found their way to Batam Books in New York City . Even though Jackson's letters were crudely written and loaded with grammatical errors they hit the spot in how political prisoners , that Jackson called himself and his fellow black brothers behind bars , are being treated by the law enforcement and legal systems in America . Jackson spent his time in solitary not only writing but keeping himself in shape . Doing as many as 1 , 000 fingertip push-ups every day Jackson's forearms became so muscle-bound that he couldn't put them through the steel bars in his cell when he was to be manacled for his daily supervised half hour walk in the prison's exercise yard . The eye-opening and thought provoking letters had Batam send one of its proof writers David Dryer to see George Jackson in getting his OK to publish them . Grudgingly agreeing to let Batam publish his letters in a book called " Soledad Brothers " George Jackson became a literary sensation overnight . In the end the fame that Jackson got from his writings lead to him making himself a martyr for his cause , Black Liberation . This celebrity status had Jackson go on the road that lead to what was to become Black August , or Saturday , on August 21 , 1971 at San Quentin . The money and fame that Jackson got from is writing " Soledad Brothers " could have gotten him the legal help that would have easily overturned his conviction on a $70 . 00 gas station robbery in 1960 that had him serve , like Jackson said , over one year behind bars for every $10 . 00 he stole . Always maintaining that he was Innocent of prison guard Mills murder Jackson getting so caught up with his own popularity , in and out of prison , refused to plead innocent to Mills murder just to keep his revolutionary image in tact . What I feel was the real reason for Jacksons death wish was the death of his younger brother 17 year-old Jonathan who , together with two fellow Black Guerrilla Family members , was gunned down at the Marin County Civic Center in San Raphael on August 7 , 1970 . Jonhatan tries to get his big brother George freed by taking hostages right out of a courtroom at the center . Jonathan together with his fellow kidnappers William Christmas and James McCain as well as the presiding judge in the courtroom Harold Haley were killed as well as a number of jurors wounded in the wild and deadly police and kidnappers crossfire . With his kid brother Jonathan , who George affectionately called Man-Child , gone Jackson just gave up on life in and out of prison and that lead to his ill conceived breakout a year later ; Where he ended up dead with his brains blown out by a sniper's bullet . P . S George Jackson was to go on trial for the murder of John V . Mills , just three days after his death in San Quentin , on August 24 , 1971 . A trial that many in the legal profession as well as fellow black activists were sure he would have won his freedom with the help of the money as well as nation wide , mostly positive , publicity that he got from his best selling book " Soledad Brothers " . By then Jackson got so caught up with his both bad a image as well as guilt for his brother Jonathan death that freedom as sweet to him as if was before all this happened wasn't all that appealing to George anymore .

Stephen Kildare , Samuel H . Hinds . It doesn't take long for Jimmy to leave Dartford and his parents Mr . & Mrs . Kildare , played by Emma Dunn , as well as his long suffering girlfriend Alice ( Lynn Carver ) , who's been waiting for him all this time , for the big city's , NYC , Balir General Hospital . Dr . Kildare want's to make his mark as a diagnostician and the best place is Blair where the world renowned Dr . Leonard , or Lenny , Gillespie , Lionel Barymore , is in charge not only of the diagnosis but the surgery department as well . Things don't go as well as Jimmy expected in him being chewed out by Dr . Gillespie the first day he started his residency at Blair in front of all his fellow interns . In no time at all Dr . Kildare makes a name for himself in being able to diagnose on the spot illnesses and cure them with almost miraculous medical powers . This makes the grumpy Dr . Gillespie take notice of the young Doctor Jimmy Kildare even though he acts like he's not at all that impressed with Jimmy's almost unearthly healing skills . Dr . Kildare being the morally-minded person that he is get's himself in hot water later in the movie by after first rescuing heiress Barbara Chanler , Jo Ann Sayers , he refuses to reveal the reason for her attempted suicide . Barbara breaking up with her fiancée Jack Hamilton , Truman Bradley , over him not taking her to the Blue Sawn nightclub ended up with horse owner Albert Foster , Leonard Penn , who got her juiced , inebriated , and left her almost dead drunk in one of the clubs private gambling rooms . Staggering out semi conscious into the street Barbara ended up in this Bowery flophouse where she tried to kill herself by turning on the gas oven in her room without lighting it . It seems that Barbara even though the movie doesn't spell it out , it leaves it to the viewers imagination , felt that Foster took advantage of her while she was drunk . The shock of her fiancée Jack finding out that she's isn't a virgin on their wedding night was just too much for Barbara to take and thus decided , in what later turned out to be for the wrong reason , to take her own life . Being a doctor Jimmy Kildare knew that Barbara , after examining her , was not at all the " damaged goods " that she thought she was . It was Dr . Jimmy Kildare's sweet and caring , as well as private , doctor patient relationship that put Barbara off from killing herself again . This in the end cured Barbara of the fears she had in what Foster did , which in fact he didn't , to her . In keeping the truth about Barbara from his superior the administrator of Blair General Dr . P Walter Carew , Walter Kingsford , almost got Jimmy kicked out of the place . It turned that Dr . Lenny Gillespie came to the young and besieged , on all sides , Dr . Kildare's rescue by offering the startled young man a chance to be his assistant which he , at first thinking that the old guy was going to chew him out , snapped up without a moments hesitation . The future now looked bright for Young Doctor Kildare but at the same time looked very ominous for old man Gillespie in that he's suffering for a bad case of melanoma , skin cancer , and he knew his days were numbered . It's in the short time that he had left Dr . Gillespie planned to teach his young potage , Jimmy Kildare , all he knows about medicine before the final curtain comes down on him . P . S Amazingly the movie had Dr . Kildare examine Dr . Gillespie on his condition , melanoma , and he predicted that Ol'Lenny still had some ten years of life left in his gas-tank . Gillespie putting Dr . Kildare down on how ridicules his prognosis is it in fact turned out to be right on target ! Old and feisty Dr . Gillespie would out last young Doctor Kildare , or actor Lew Ayres who played him , in the Doctor Kildare series by some five years ! That's exactly tens years since Dr . Kildare diagnosed the old man telling him that he'll overcome his cancerous condition . In fact after the Doctor Kildare movies came to an end in 1947 Dr . Gillespie , with his portage Dr . Kildare no longer around , was still very much alive and as healthy as he was when the series first started back in 1938 !

568796	2721657	99768	7.0	Like the layers of an onion , the more you peel away , the more you feel like crying	SPOILERS Top notch political thriller set in Northern Ireland that goes well beyond the conflict in that troubled British controlled province and into the heart and policy making of the British Government itself . After American human rights activist Paul Sullivan , Brad Dourif , was gunned down together with his Irish contact Molloy , Brian McCann , by the British police outside of Dungannon an official inquiry is brought in on the case with high ranking British law enforcement officers Kerrigan & Maxwell , Brian Cox & John Benfield . Kerrigan getting in touch with Sullivan's friend and colleague in the American human rights group Ingrid Jessner , Frances McDormand , finds out from her that Sullivan together with Molloy were to meet with this mysterious stranger Harris , Maurice Roeves . The meeting with Harris was to be about the authenticity of a tape he had made that was in the possession of Sullivan that seemed to have disappeared from the shooting sight . Jessner get's some information from a secret I . R . A , which it turns out that the late Molloy was a member of , source that the tape contained such explosive information that if made public can unseat the Thatcher regime and bring a number of very high government officials to the bar of justice on charges of treason against the state . Jessner together with Kerrigan gets in touch with the author , Harris , of the incriminating tape at a secret I . R . A meeting hall in Belfast . It turns out that Harris is not only British but a former member of the super-secret UK intelligence agency M15 . Harris tells both Jessner and Kerrigan that the deaths of Sullivan and Molloy wasn't , as the official report states , self-defense on the polices part but cold-blooded murder . Harris goes on with what was on the missing tape that Sullivan had on him , that was not in the report . Harris revelations are so shocking that it get's the usual by the book Kerrigan to not only risk his career as a police officer but his life to uncover it . Top members of the British Government had created a shadow / agency answerable only to themselves . This secret agency helped to destroy the previous Edward Heath left to center Conservative Party that controlled Britian during the 1970's and had it replaced , by defeating Heath in the 1975 Conservative party's election , with the ultra-right wing Conservative Margerat Tatcher who's completely under their control . Forming secret death-squads these usurpers behind the throne , or Tatcher Regime , have been pulling off a number of political assassinations all over Britian , as well as in the Irish Republic . Their main purpose was to silence anyone they feel threatened by and if murder doesn't do the trick , like in the case of Officer Kerrigan , personal or political blackmail will . The movie " Secret Agenda " get's a bit unbelievable with Kerrigan agreeing to go all the way in retrieving the important tape , that Harris duplicated , with Jessner . Kerrigan in effect chickens out at the last moment and leaves her out in the cold as he goes to his superiors in the British Police . Kerrigan tells them everything about his and Jessner's , who Kerrigan kept in the dark about all this , upcoming meeting with Harris who's to hand over the secret tape to them the next day at Dublin's O'Connell Bridge ! Jessner's meeting with Harris turns into a disaster with him being grabbed by M15 agents who were tipped off , in his being unknowingly double-crossed , by a very naive Kerrigan who should have known better ! Beaten and handcuffed Harris is quickly put in a van where he's later shot and killed and his murder made to look like the work of the I . R . A . During all this confusion Jessner gets away from the perusing M15 agents and is later confronted at the Belfast Airport , where she plans to get out of the country , by Kerrigan . Asking Jessner if she has the tape that Harris was to give to her Kerrigan get an unequivocal no answer from her and as both he and his partner Maxwell leave and Jessner goes on her flight back to the US the film goes into freeze-frame and ends . Irgrid Jessner learned a lot from what she herself saw in Northern Ireland and heard from Harris & Co . The most important revelation that Jessner got from all that is never to trust anybody in government , including the very helpful at times Kerrigan . Jessner in fact did have Harris ' tape and listening to it in her car on the way to the airport made up her mind that the British people had been hoodwinked long enough . Whats more they deserves to know the truth about what their government is doing in their name and will make sure that they'll find that out by making the contents of Harris ' tape public through the free and open American media : that's if they'll have both the guts and foresight to print or broadcast it !

Peyton Westlake , Liam Neeson , is recovered from the river and brought to the local hospital . In an effort to keep the pain of his injuries bearable the nerve endings to his brain were severed , but by doing that it greatly enhanced his emotions , love hate and rage among others . Those strong emotions soon came into play when he he broke out of the hospital looking first for his girlfriend Julie , Francs McDormand , and then the Durant mob and their boss Louis Strack to whom Julie worked for Strack's firm as his law partner . Left with his mind as well as his body horribly deformed . Westlake living in a deserted factory went back to his project of developing synthetic skin to replace the burns that he received from him being attacked by the Durant Mob . The best that he could do , like before him being burned , was that the skin would last for less then 100 minutes before it would dissolve and become useless . With an unstoppable fury Westlake / Darkman takes out his rage at the Durant Mob whom he smashes to bits and then confronts Strack and , who after telling Darkman that he doesn't have the conscience to do it , drops him some 650 feet to his death from a building site of his on the city waterfront . Strack obviously didn't know that Darkman put away Durant , Larry Drake , and his boys without any trouble to his conscience at all . Unlike most comic super hero's Darkman didn't have a secret identity and doesn't get the girl that he loves at the end of the movie . Darkman unlike most comic book hero's is not really a crime fighter . The bad guys that Darkman takes care of in the movie were for personal reasons not for the elimination of crime from society . These are the reasons that makes Darkman unique and why the audience can personally identify with Darkman more then with most of the comic book super hero's put on film : Darkman wasn't out to save the world from evil , he was out to avenge the evil that was done to him .

Shaw murdered by the very people , the police , who are now using her death to frame the innocent Sean Vail !

And possibly , with the help of his fellow convicts , have Vail murdered while behind bars in order to keep that socking truth from ever seeing the light of day !

568293	2721657	47136	8.0	Look everybody's looking at me , this is the first time I ever felt important !	SPOILERS Subliminal and thought-provoking Western that covers far more ground then can be digested in just one screening . Basically a story of a bitter rivalry between Emma Small , Marcedes McCambrige , and Vienna the local saloon owner , Joan Crawford . The two fight over the love and affections of the Dancin ' Kid , Scott Brady . The Dancin ' Kid together with his gang of fun loving and hard drinking cowboys run a silver mine outside of town . Emma was madly in love with the Kid but he dumped her for the much more attractive and down to earth Vienna . This has the vindictive and almost insane with jealousy Emma want to have both of them , the Kid & Vienna , end up with their necks at the end of a hang-rope . With her brother Len gunned down in a stagecoach robbery Emma immediately accuses both the Kid & Vienna of having something to do with Len's death . For the rest of the movie Emma tries to whip up a lynch mob to hang both of them . All this results in total chaos and destruction of the town and it's surroundings as well as almost everyone in the film . With the movies main , who its titled after , character Johnny Guitar , Sterling Hayden , coming onto the scene we get a feeling that him and Vienna seemed to have known each other , very intimately , some time ago . It's obvious just from the strange and revealing dialog between the two : " lie to me say that you really love me " a heart-sick and tearful Johnny pleads to Vienna . Dropping into Vienna's saloon from far flung Albuquerque Johnny we find out was hired by Vienna to entertain the customers with his banjo or guitar but also to protect the place , and Vienna , with his six-shooter . We soon find out that there's much more to Johnny then his talents as a musician but his also lighting fast draw . Johnny is not only the fastest gun in the West Johnny Logan but also Vienna's lover from yesteryear who she broke up with five years ago . Thats when she was a bar-girl and Johhny was the toast of the town in Albuquerque . Now with her owning Vienna's saloon and about to strike it rich , with the railroad slated to go through her property , the shoe is on the other foot . With him needing Vienna not the other way around when she would have crawled at his feet to keep Johnny from walking out on her . The film in a weird way has the two women in it , Vienna & Emma , be far more manly then any man in it . That includes the entire lynch mob who we can find no one with the raw hatred and malice to hang the innocent Vienna . Even though they have no trouble at all stringing up the boy-like Turkey , Ben Cooper , who besides being a member of the Dancin ' Kid's gang was also involved in a bank robbery of the towns bank . We also see at the end of the movie with the shooting and bloodshed getting so out of hand that the lynch mob lead by a now almost crazed Emma not having the stomach , with the entire Dancin ' Kid's gang rubbed out , to go after both Vienna and Johnny . Who were both innocent of the trumped up charges of bank and stagecoach robberies , as well as the murder of Len , by the vindictive and hateful Emma . They just walk off and let both Emma and Vienna shoot it out in the movies exciting and heart-thumping final . One of Joan Crawford's best movies even , in many movie critics opinions , outdoing her Acadamy Award winning 1945 role in " Mildred Pierce " . Undoubatly this was Nicholas Ray's cryptic and camouflaged description of McCathyism and the communist witch hunts back in the 1950's . We see in " Johnny Guitar " how people can be whipped up against an innocent person , or persons , and then lead to do things that they would soon regret . And how people with axes to grind or money to make exploit and foment mindless hatred . As well as use the unthinking and impressionable public to achieve their ends no matter how evil they are and how many innocent persons they destroy .
568987	2721657	47542	8.0	Whatever happens in this town happens Suddenly !	SPOILERS Hired assassin John Baron , Frank Sinatra , saw just how futile the " hit-Job " , that he and his fellow hired killers who were paid up to $500 , 000 . 00 each , was to assassinate the President of the United States ; " A second after he's shot he'll be replaced by someone else so what's the purpose of killing the President anyway " ? The movie " Suddenly is more then just a solid thriller as well as a curiosity piece . It unknowingly and unconsciously foretells a real presidential assassination , JFK , by some nine years after it's release . The way the assassination is depicted planned and put into motion is far more realistic and believable then what the Warran Commission come up with . Instead of one lone nut all by himself with one gun that The Warren Commission came up with the film had a trio of professional killers . Who were hired by an unknown person , or persons , to knock off the president for reasons known only to themselves . Another oddity about the film " Sudddenly " is that it was actually broadcast on the CBS network's " The Early Show " weeks before the assassination of JFK took place in November 1963 . With the President of the United States special train due to stop at the town of Suddenly the Secret Service FBI and local policemen get a tip of a possible assassination , that they got from a shot and dying hoodlum . The cops search the building and stores by the railway station to make sure that everything is secure for the president's stopover It also turns out the tip was real ; three hired hit men are in town to pay the president a deadly visit . Lead by John Baron the thee , posing as FBI men , take over the home of Pete Benson , a retired Secret Service man , and his widowed daughter Ellen and eight-year-old grandson Pidge , James Gleson Nancy Gates & Kim Charney . The trio shoots both Sheriff Tod Shaw , Sterling Hayden , who was wounded and Secret Service head Don Carney , Willis Bouchey , who died as they came to the door to check things out . It's now just a matter of time for the train to pull up and for them , with Baron as the shooter , to get the president in their cross-hairs . It's between the time that the killers wait for the presidential train to pull up at the station that two of them Benny Conkln & Bart Wheeler , Paul Frees & Christopher Blake , begin to realize what their doing and how the odds are against them to survive and escape from the law ; nobody has ever gotten away with killing a President of the United States and they'll be no exception . Only the psycho and insecure Barnon thinks that he can pull this off , even after Benny is shot dead by the Suddenly police , as he cased out the train station less then an hour before the president's train was to arrive . Being on an ego trip more then anything else Baron , despite the police already being tipped off , is determined to get the job done and in the end does a job not only on his co-hit-men but on himself . Chilling as well as entertaining movie with Frank Sinatra at his best as crazed ex-war veteran John Baron who feels that life had dealt him a losing hand and was to even everything up by killing the president and getting away with it at the same time . Sterling Hayden is a bit stiff as the towns Sheriff Tod Shaw and has a hard time convincing the audience , as well as those on the screen , that he's in danger of losing his life even after he was shot . Hayden reads his lines in such a mechanical way that he comes across as if he's a telephone answering machine . Both Nancy Gates and James Gleason as Ellen & Pete Benson are effective as hostages . Ellen's concern for her son and father as well as her fear of guns , Ellen's husband was killed in the Korean War , comes across believable and at the same time unnerving . Since she's forced to use a hated gun to save her and her father together with Pete , James O'Hara , and her son's Pidge lives towards the end of the movie .
568776	2721657	120192	8.0	This Is Unbelievable !	SPOILERS An anything goes wild stag party turns into a nightmare for all those involved with half of the participants ending up dead , from gunshots beatings suicide and even a heart-attack , and the other half having their lives ruined forever . It didn't have to happen this way it was just to be an evening of good natured fun for the person that the party was being thrown for " Entrepreneur of the Year " Victor Mallick , John Stockwell . Victor about to get married had everything going for him in both business and marriage but that went down the drain together with his freedom by the time the night of horrors ended . Victor now faces some seven years behind bars with his good friend and business partner attorney Michael Barnes , Mario Van Peebles , turning states evidence against him . As for that slick and slimy shyster , who's running for city council , Michael Barnes all his back-stabbing and legal maneuvering in the end will not only have his license to practice law revoked but have him end up as Victor's cell-mate . Michael as smart as he was , in saving his lousy neck , overlooked an object that recorded the entire sleazy cover-up that he orchestrated . A good old video camcorder that was accidentally left , during all the confusion , on record mode ! The party at first was going as expected with everyone getting juiced on booze and drugs until two , paid for their services , strippers Kelly together with her older sister Serena , Jenny McShane & Taylor Dayne , and their friend Stoker , William Parel , unexpectedly dropped in . Dressed as policemen the three , Kelly Serena & Stoker , ended up setting off the by now out of control and excited party-goers to the point where Kelly ended up dead with her spine broken . Trying to cover up Kelly's death , which in fact was accidental , the stag-party goer made things a lot worse in trying to protect their careers and reputations by acting like criminals more then just someone , or someones , who're victims of circumstances . A lot like the movie " 12 Angry Men " we get to see the guest of honor Victor and his drinking and partying buddies try to justify their actions that lead to Kelly's death . In justifying their actions Victor & Co . do things far worse , and with full knowledge of what their doing , then what they did to the deceased Kelly by accident ! What we get is a night of planning conniving and executing crimes that in the end would put the entire cast of characters , with the exception of those who ended up dead , behind bars for up to fifteen years . The film " Stag " shows how a group of totally innocent and , with the exception of the stag party's drug supplier ex-con Pete Webber ( Andrew McCarthy ) , upright citizens can in their unfounded fear be whipped up to commit a number of major crimes in a frantic effort to save their jobs freedoms and reputations . Webber , the drug dealer , being a career criminal was anything but concerned in murdering those who can implicate him in Kelly's death . It was fascinating to see Webber's , who should have known better , plan since the worst that he , having really nothing to lose , could get is breaking his parole not losing a six figure job in the business legal sports or entertainment world . SPOILER ALERTThe person at the party who was just there because he was Victor's good friend , not that he was a big success in anything , Gulf War Vet Dan Kane , Kevin Dillion , was the only one who seemed to have his head screwed on straight . Trying to do the right thing Ken almost gets himself shot by non-other then Victor , in trying to save his a , who didn't know who his friends really were until the police put the cuffs on him . Victor trusted his good friend and business partner Michael Barnes who's testimony sent him up the river without a paddle and , when he was to be released , job to support his very expensive lifestyle . P . S What a difference things would have been for Victor , as well as those at the stag party , if he just listened to his friend Ken . Ken , unlike Michael Barnes , looked after Victor's best interests not those of his own . In the end the almost invisible , to those at the party , camcorder , and what it recorded , was the evidence that got Ken off the hook as well as hooked Victor and his friends into the sate penitentiary .

It's that the murdered woman Maria Covyenska was working undercover for German intelligence in finding and identifying Polish and Jewish guerrilla fighter . What's far far worse , in Maj .

Covyenska was murdered ! The three suspected generals are Gen . Tanz , Peter O'Tool , and Generals Kahenberg , Donald Plesence , and Von Seiditz-Gabler , Charles Gray .

Maj . Grau runs into the killer some two years later in Paris who commits the very same kind of crime and has his aid Lance Cpl . Kurt Hartmann , Tom Courter , set up and framed for it . It's during that fateful summer of 1944 that Maj . Grau ends up getting involved with the other two suspected generals , guess who , in a plot to assassinate German Dictator Adolph Hitler ! Maj .

568743	2721657	89003	8.0	What about the cops ! do they do anything ? Yeah their enforcing the parking laws !	SPOILERS Paul Kersey , Charles Bronson , travels to the East New York section of Brooklyn NY to see an old army buddy of his Charly , Francis Drake , only to find him dying from a beating he got from a gang of thugs for not paying them their weekly protection money . Paul is arrested by the police for Charly's murder because he had a handgun on him , even though Charly was beaten not shot to death , and thrown into a lock-up at the local police 74th precinct . Paul is later attacked by both the prisoners , for standing up to them , and the Police Chief Richard Shriker , Ed Lauter , for giving him lip . Released because of the hard work done for Paul by civil rights attorney Kathryan Davis , Deborah Raffin , with Chief Shriker then planing to use him , clandestinely , against the local neighborhood thugs . Paul then goes back to East New York to see what he can do to help those friends of Charly still living and having to put up with the record crime rate there . By the time that the movie is over there won't one one street gang member left standing and making trouble for the people of that ravaged locality . In the most ferocious and explosive " Death Wish " movie of them all Paul Kersey , who for some reason calls himself Paul Kimble in this film , takes on an entire army of New York street gangs in the burnt-out and devastated battleground of East New York with an arsenal that has just about everything , short of nuclear weapons . The action in " Death Wish 3 " is reminiscent of the battle of Stalingrad during the fall and winter of with street-to-street house-to-house and hand-to-hand fighting that left the borough of Brooklyn looking in 1985 like the city of Berlin did in 1945 . With hundreds of street gang member civilians and cops dead and wounded in it's smoldering ruins . The local police who were not up to the job to stop the ravaging street gangs on the loose in the streets of Brooklyn gave Paul the green light , through Chief Shriker , to take on the gang members by himself ; That's as long as they , the police , get the credit for Paul's successful combat operations against them . Taking out a number of vicious street gang members notably " The Giggler " , Kirk Taylor , things turn bad when Paul's lady friend and civil lawyer Kathryan gets killed by gang leader Fraker , Gavan O'Herlihy , and a fellow thug . The two thugs knock Kathryan out and then shove her car into a busy intersection where she was killed in a head-on collision . Paul escapes after he was put into protective custody by Chief Shriker from the re-enforced street gangs after Fraker got hundreds of fellow " gansters " from all over NYC to join him in his war against the good people of East New York . Back in the " Hood " Paul inspires , through his heroic actions , the entire neighborhood to rise up and take on the gangs and even , for once , the totally useless police joined in the fight . Increidable final sequence that rivals anything that you'll see in any major war movie made in or out of Hollywood as full-scale war rages on the battered and bloodied streets of Brooklyn . Paul and his friends and neighbors , as well as the cops , take on the massive hoards of New York street gangs with everything from nail-boards to sticks and stones to heavy machine guns and anti-tank and armor piercing rocket launchers . The final confrontation in the movie has head gang leader Fraker at first surviving a barrage of bullets from Paul's . 38 police special , by wearing a bullet-proof vest , getting pulverized into smatterings by a blast from Paul's bazooka . The rocket launching bazooka that Paul used to pulverize the startled Faker was a WMD , weapon of mass destruction , powerful enough to take down a giant B52 bomber ! Charles Bronson as the big city vigilante Paul Kersey showed again , like he did in his two previous " Death Wish " films , that when you mess with him and those dear and near to him you've opened the very gates of Hell on yourself .
568692	2721657	73453	8.0	Checkmate	SPOILERS Like the champion chess games that we see private detective Harry Moseby , Gene Hackman , play and replay in the film " Night Moves " the case that he's taken on to find former Hollywood starlet Arleen Iverson's , Janet Ward , 16 year-old runaway daughter Delly , Melanie Griffith , has a number of important moves that he , like the chess-masters who he's studying , completely overlooked . On the first night on the job on the Delly Grastner case Harry catches his wife Ellen , Susan Clark , leaving an art movie with the co-owner of her antique shop Charles , Ben Archibek , and takes off with a stranger ( to Harry ) the limping Marty Heller , Harris Yulin , and then make out with him in the back of his car . This complicates his job as a private eye with Harry now more interested in finding out why Ellen is cheating on him instead of finding the elusive Delly . It later turns out that Ellen was going to tell Herry about her affair but he beat her to it by confronting Marty at his beach-front house ; Ellen later sadly tell him that he's married to his job not to her . Puttng Ellen's affair behind him Harry tracks down Delly's boyfriend Quinten , James Woods , a mechanic who works on movie sets and was the last person to have seen Delly . Getting Quinten to open up , by almost cracking his skull , and later having a talk with both stuntman Marve Ellman and stunt-coordinator Joey Ziegler , Ed Binn , it becomes obvious to Harry that Delly went east , to Key West Florida . Delly left to get away from her abusing mom to her step-father Tom Iverson , John Crawford , who runs a charter boat for tourist there with his co-worker and mistress Paula , Jennifer Warren . Things start to come together when Harry easily finds Delly staying at Iverson's place and even more surprising Delly , with very little encouragement , agrees to fly back to L . A to be re-united with her hated mother Arleen Iverson . The night before she was to be returned back home Delly skinny-dipping off her step-fathers glass-bottom boat finds the remains of a crashed aircraft with a dead body inside . The crash victim later turns out to be Hollywood stuntman Marve Ellman . Back in California Delly is killed days later at a movie set in a staged car crash and Harry feels that Quinten , who serviced the car , was responsible for her death . It starts to become evident that the whole story behind Delly's death has to do with Delly somehow getting involved , by running away to her step-father in Key West , in something that has to do with Tom Iverson and possibly his lover Paula . The two were connected in an illegal smuggling operation out of Tom's home on the Florida keys and that Delly being there brought attention to it by Harry tracking her down and finding her there . The movie " Night Moves " unwinds slowly from an missing person case to a multi-million dollar smuggling operation involving Yucatan artifacts that has a number of Hollywood-types , who end up dead , involved in it . Harry , who during the movie has an affair with Paula and at the same time gets Ellen to come back to him doesn't know what he up against and is slowly made to understand just who his friends and enemies really are in the film by all the chess pieces falling into place .
568557	2721657	69436	8.0	The only thing that will slow them down is how many people they kill	SPOILERS Breaking out of the San Carlos Indian Reservation Ulzana , Joaquim Martinez , and eight of his fellow Apaches go on a blood curdling rampage against the white homesteaders in the area . The US Calvary gets their best Indian fighter McIntosh , Burt Lancaster , and his Apache scout Ke-Ni-Tay , Jorge Luke , to help them track down Ulzana and his raiders before they have the entire reservation rise up and join them . Using guerrilla-like tactics Ulzana despite being vastly outnumbered by the US Calvary seems to be getting his way who by now has terrorized not only the homesteaders but the US Calvary itself with his hit and run attacks . The movie " Ulzana's Raid " pulls no punches in how it depicts the Apaches in their treatment of those unfortunate enough to end up being captured by them . There's one shocking scene when the Apaches attack a wagon with a mother and son riding in it as the calvary man guarding it takes off leaving the terrified woman and boy behind . The trooper Horowitz , Dean Smith , suddenly turns and looks like he's about to save the woman Mrs . Ginsford , Margare Fairchild , and her ten year-old son Bobby then without a second thought pulls out his revolver and shoots Mrs . Ginsford dead ! It was his way of preventing the poor woman from suffering a fate worse then death at the hands of the oncoming Apaches . Horowitz himself seeing that there's no hope of him escaping blows his brains out and ends up with the Apaches sadistically tearing out his heart and gleefully playing catch with it ! As for Bobby he's left alive by his mother and Horowitz's killers to be traumatized for the rest of his life in what he just experienced which was anything but an act of mercy on their part . The US calvary troop lead by Lt . Garnett DeBuin , Bruce Davidson , makes slow but steady progress against Ulzana's raiders who are drawing the cavalrymen deeper into the desert in order to ambush them . As Lt . DeBuin , who's a very devote Christian , and his men come across what Ulzana did he starts to hate not only Ulzana and his gang of raiders in particular but all Apaches in general . Never seeing the savagery that he experienced in tracking down Ulzana Lt . DeBuin in fact becomes far more hateful against the Indians then McIntosh who's known the Apaches all his life ! In fact McIntosh's wife is a full-blooded Apache Indian . At first Lt . DeBuin was anything but impressed with either McIntosh or his Apache scout Ke-Ni-Tay in feeling that they were no better in some ways then the gang of Apache raiders they were tracking down . Not being outraged at Ulzana had the young Lt . DeBuin think that McIntosh was in some way excusing what he and his men did . It was later that McIntosh enlightened the young lieutenant in telling him that hating what Ulzana and his men , as well as the entire Apache tribe , did was like hating the desert for not having water . Let . DeBuin also didn't realize that it was the US government who by how it treated the Apache as well as all the other Indian tribes that in more ways then one created men like Ulzana . The movie ends with Ulzana being trapped in a canyon with McIntosh and his men holding him off while Lt . DeBuin and the US Calvary comes to their rescue . The green and untested Lt . DeBuin had spread his men too thin and their rescue effort came up short with all of McIntosh's , with the exception of Ke-Ni-Tay , men ending up dead or wounded . Ulzana's men are all killed during the ambush he planed on McIntosh with him seeing that it's all over he lets himself get shot and killed by his brother-in-law who just happened to be Ke-Ni-Tay . McIntosh badly wounded in the fighting is left at his own request to die together with his men and as he takes out a cigarette and is about to have a last drag " Ulzana's Raid " goes into freeze frames and ends . One of the very few realistic westerns to come out in years that lets the chips fall where they may in how things were in the war between the White Man and the American Indian back in the late 19th century . We see that both sides were anything but civilized in treating each other and that's what also had Lt . DeBuin finally realize in what he so blindly overlooked in the Apaches , as well as all the other Indian Tribes , that he was dealing with on both sides of the battle-line .

Later at the ship-yard Rosalie's husband the famous defense attorney Authur Bannister , Everet Stone , unexpectedly shows up looking for Michael . Bannister offers Michael a job to sail him and his wife Rosalie on their Yacht down to the Caribbean and finally back to their west coast home in San Francisco . Some time later sailing off shore of a small Caribbiean island George Grisby , Glenn Anders , unexpectedly rows aboard and Michael somehow realizes that the trip that he's on isn't exactly the pleasure cruise that he thought it would be . Grimsby turns out to be Authur Bannister's law partner as well as a private detective who's checking on Rosalie to see if she's cheating on her husband . Before sailing back to San Francisco Michael feeling very uneasy about the whole arraignment on the boat thinks of quiting but he's fallen so much in love with Rosalie that his emotions overrule his intuitions . That miscalculation on his part soon leads Michael right into the trap that was set for him by one or all of the three on board . When back in SF the Bannister butler Sidney Broome , Ted De Corsia , is murdered and then his killer non-other Grisby is also found dead with him having a signed confession by Michael to his murder ! The frame up is now complete and with the false and concocted evidence on him being air tight and unshakable Michaels worst fears became a reality . Authur Bannister volunteering to defend Michael seems to also be in on the frame that's pointing him straight into the California gas chamber . During his trial Michael starts to feel , by the way Bannisers is conducting his defense , that's exactly what he's doing . Breaking away from the court police before the verdict is even reached Michael is now an innocent man on the run and no one to turn to . Ending up in an empty and deserted carnival fun-house , on the San Francisco waterfront , Michael tries to find the one person who could exonerate him of Grisby's , and possibly Broome's , murder : the murderer himself . Wells has trouble trying to stick to an Irish brogue that he uses on and off in the film and the bleach blond Rita Hayworth is at the top of her game . Everet Stone as the secretive and sinister Authur Bannister gives one of the best performances of his long stage and screen career who you don't realize until the last , and shattering , scene in the film just what or what not he has to do with Micael's frame-up . The now classic ending in the fun-house's Hall of Mirrors has been copied countless times over the years but never equaled even with the advancement of computer-enhanced special effects . It's not the effects in that scene it's the acting by Wells Hayworth and Stone and direction , also by by Wells , that makes it so memorable .

It's then that Cody realizes just what a pair of murderous rat finks his wife Verna and her boyfriend Big Ed really are . Cody also knows that his Ma is in danger of getting killed herself if she , like she told him , tries to take the two on singled handedly . It's a short time later when Cody finds out through the prison grapevine that his Ma was dead shot in the back and killed but by his old lady Verna , not Big Ed like he was later made by a terrified Verna to believe .

Fallon for his part is exposed as a " Copper " by one of Cody's men Bob Creel , Ian MacDoald , who recognized him as being the guy who once set , like he's now doing to Cody , him up . In one of his most electrifying and maniacal roles ever James Cagney lets it all out , with bullets flying in all directions , as he goes completely berserk in the film " White Heat " final gut and oil spilling climax . With his gang wiped out Cody climbs on top of an giant oil refinery tank and has it out with the police and federal agents . Knowing that there's no way but up , in a flaming oil & chemical explosion , for him Cody insanely as well as bravely holds off dozens of scared to death , and hiding in every crack and crevasse that they can find , lawmen in a final last stand against justice . Cody during the shootout takes some half dozen slugs from a high powered rifle fired by his former prison buddy Vic Pardo / Hank Fallon who had since turned ran and joined the rescuing police .

P . S I can just imagine what Arthur " Cody " Jarrett's crazed actions in destroying about a quarter of the US oil supply did to oil and chemical futures on the commodity and foreign exchanges .

Worth watching now as it was back then in 1943 about an America that was meant to be in the nation that our founding fathers fought and died for back during the American Revolutionary War .
568804	2721657	75005	9.0	The Devil's Apprentice	( There are Spoilers ) After the 1973 release of the devilishly inspired movie " The Exorcist " scores of films about the Devil were cranked out of the movie studios in Hollywood and overseas to take advantage , in their box office sales , of that ground-breaking horror classic . It wasn't until three later in 1976 that a movie came along that not only matched " The Exorcist " in sheer Satanic inspired terror but actually eclipsed it in it's storyline The movie has the Devil comes back on earth to usher in the End of Times that would effect the entire human race not just the little 12 year-old girl that the Devil possessed and took control of in that 1973 block-buster . Rushing to a Catholic Church run hospital in Rome where his wife Katie , Lee Remick , was about to give birth US diplomat Robert Thorn , Gregory Peck , is told by one of the men involved in Katie's hospitalization and delivery Father Spiletto , Martin Benson , that his and Katie's son was born dead . A shocked and heart-broken Robert is then told that his and Katie's dead son was replaced with a newborn baby boy who was born with his mother dying in childbirth . Robert knowing that Katie always wanted to have a child and that the news that her baby was delivered stillborn , and that she'll never be able to have children again , would kill her goes along with Father Spiletto and keeps the truth from Katie . The time of the Thorns adopted sons birth was recorded in the hospital at exactly 6 : 06AM Rome time the date was June the sixth or and the Thorns named their son Damien , Harvey Stephens , With Robert later appointed to be the Ambassador to the Court of Saint James , Great Britain , things couldn't have been better for him and his wife and young son . Suddenly at Damien's fifth birthday party strange things began to happen that lead Robert to later believe , as the evidence piled up to the point where he could no longer ignore it , that whoever his sons real parents were they weren't human and even more shocking not of this earth ! All this weirdness starts with Damien's nanny , Holly Palance , jumping to her death at his fifth birthday party , with a rope tied around her neck . Strange tings continue to happen with Damien exhibiting such subconscious terror that when taken to a local zoo with his mom the animals go completely berserk with fear at the very sight of the young boy . Robert is later contacted by a catholic priest Father Brenner , Patrick Thoughton , who claimed that he was at the hospital the night that Damien was born . Robert is told that Damien's birth mother was not a human being and his father was non-other then the Devil himself ! In short Damien is the Beast predicted in the Bible to bring about the end of the world , and human race , in the climatic engagement between Good and Evil thats so frightfully described in the battle of Armageddon . What even more convinced Robert about Damien's dark background was when Father Brenner was killed , just after he got in contact with him about the truth of Damien's strange and demonic powers . Father Brenner's impending death was predicted by a number of photos of him taken by free-lance photographer Keith Jennings , David Warner , that indicated , like they had with the deceased Damien's nanny , that he was somehow marked for death ! Damien in the meantime was being protected from harm and exposer of his identity by his new nanny Mrs . Baylock , Billie Whitelaw , a fanatical crypto-Satanist and this vicious large and sentry-like Devil Dog that Robert , who was very intimidated by , seemed to have to way of keeping out of the house ! Following up a number of clues to Damien's true identify both Robert and Jennings go to the cemetery where Damien's true mother is buried . The two are shocked to find , like what Father Brenner told Robert , that Damien's mother wasn't human ! Just as Robert and Jennings are about to leave a number of wild Devil Dogs , much like the one protecting Damien , suddenly appear out of nowhere attacking and driving both of them out of the grave yard and surviving from being torn to pieces by climbing over the cemetery's iron fence . Robert and Jennins go to the Holy Land in Israel at an excavation site outside of Jerusalem's to see archaeologist Carl Bugenhagen , Leo McKern , about the true reason behind Damien's connection to the Thorns . Bugenhagen after confirming Roberts darkest fears gives him a number of knives that will put an end to Damien and the nightmare he's creating . Robert is again shocked down to his socks and soul when Jennings who tells him that he would eventually suffer an untimely and sudden death from a photo indicating it that he took of himself ! Sure enough Jennings is later decapitated in a freak accident in the Holy City . Now almost a firm believer in that Damien is in fact the Antichrist of the book of Revelation Robert has one and only one doubt left to overcome and that's the Devil's mark , the number 666 , that's to reveal Damien's true and horrifying identity . Coming home to the US Ambassadors residence outside of London Robert finds the " mark " secretly hidden under Damien's hair where he's suddenly and ferociously attacked from behind by Mrs . Baylock . The movie quickly moves to it's final and almost unwatchable and , in the case of whats expected of Robert Thorn to do , unbearable ending ! Superior horror film that hasn't aged one bit since it's released thirty years ago with a really unique and unnerving soundtrack that's effectively used throughout the film , as well as in the opening and closing credits . A both original and eerie Latin Satanic Chant entitled " Hail Satan " !
568209	2721657	63522	10.0	Year of the Devil	( There are Spoilers ) One of the best horror movies ever made with almost no blood or splatters scenes at all with the exception of Terry , Victoria Vetri , jumping , off camera , to her death form the seventh floor of the Bramford Building . " Rosemary ' Baby " has to do with the most darkest fears one can conjure up in a movie book as well as in one's own mind ; The return of Satan-the Devil-on earth and everything that goes along with him . It's early October 1965 and the Pope , Pope Paul VI , has made a historical visit to the US and is in the process of giving a sermon , to some 60 , 000 people , at New York's Yankee Stadium . It's also the time designated by a coven of Devil worshiping witches for the Devil's offspring , to be named Adrian , to be conceived by the unsuspecting and Catholic observant Rosemary Woodhouse , Mia Farrow . Since Rosemary and her actor husband Guy , John Cassavetes , moved into the creepy Bramford Building they've become very friendly with the elderly couple who lives next door to their apartment Roman and Minnie Castevet , Sidney Blackman & Ruth Roman . Even though Rosemary is not that taken in by the Castevets eccentric and somewhat wired behaviors her husband Guy is . Guy a struggling actor was desperately trying to get a part in a play that the far more talented Donald Baumgart , Tony Curtis , got . After Guy's involvement with the Castevets Baumgart suddenly lost his sight opening the door for another actor to replace him : Guy Woodhouse ! The movie starts to grow and accelerate , together with Rosemary's pregnancy , in both tension as well as curiosity as she becomes very frail and sickly as the day of the " blessed event " , June 28 , 1966 , is soon to arrive . Feeling that something just isn't right Rosmary has been haunted since her night of conception , October 1965 , it that she feels that it's wasn't Guy who fathered her now soon to be born child but the Devil or Satan , played by Clay Tanner , himself ! Despite the movie's many subplots , all centered around Rosemary's pregnancy and birth to her child , the film is never confusing in that they , the subplots , all come together in the film's final and shocking ten or so minutes ! The Woodhouse's at first had no idea to what evil existed right at their front doorsteps ! Soon they would become in their associations with the Castevets the very central , and rotten , core of it ! It was family friend Edward " Hutch " Hutchins , Maurice Evens , who knew not only the history of the eerie Bramford Building but that of one of its infamous tenants Steven Marcato . It was also that knowledge that lead to Hutch falling into a deep coma that he never came out of ! SPOILER ALERT It was Marcato who was killed by an angry New York mob some 80 years ago for secretly practicing witchcraft ! It was also Marcato who had a son who had since changed , or rearranged , his name and became a man of the world as well as , in his many travels , secretly gotten himself involved with the occult like his father did ! That person is non other then the Woodhouse's kindly and harmless looking next door neighbor Roman Castevet himself ! Making a pact with the Devil has its price and the price that Guy Woodhouse paid for bringing him , in Guy allowing Satan to rape his wife Rosemary , out of the depths of Hell and into the unsuspecting world above was more that it was worth . Guy's career in both TV and the movies , as well as the theater , took off like a shot but in reality he ended up damned for all eternity . As for poor Rosemany in the end after seeing what her new born son really looked like , and what he represented , it was both her goodness , in Rosemary's Christian beliefs , and maternal instincts that eventually overrode her horror and revulsion in what she was forced , by her husband Guy and the Castevets , to unknowingly participate in . As the movie ends Rosemary is heard humming the lullaby theme of the movie as she's gently and tenderly rocking the " cute " little Devil , her son Adrian , to sleep !
568664	2721657	361596	10.0	War Is a Racket	Major General Smedley Butler of the US Marine Corps wrote back in 1933 his famous essay on modern warfare entitled " War is a Racket " . Smedley Butler served his country for over thirty years in the US Marine Corps on three different continents in some dozen military engagements . Having won the Congressional Medal of Honor twice , not once , for courage and valor above and beyond the call of duty Gen . Butler came to this sad conclusion to the service that he rendered to his country at the twilight of his long and distinguished military career . Seventy years later Michael Moore came to the same conclusion that Gen . Butler did : " War is a Racket " . Unlike Gen . Butler who put his thoughts on paper Michael Moore put them on film in his explosive documentary " Fahrenheit " . The movie focuses in on the fateful summer of 2001 when Pres . Bush received but ignored a CIA report on August 6 , 2001 about a possible impending attack by Osama Bin-Laden's Al-Qeada terrorist group on targets on American soil . Bin-Laden planned to use hijacked passenger planes to pull this terrorist operation off , that's exactly what happened on September 11 , 2001 a month later . The Bush Administration used that tragic event to push for and pass the " Patriot Act " that that compromised the US Constitution and Bill of Rights . At the same time Pres . Bush pushed for war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq which had nothing to do with the attacks . Being that the Al-Qeada was in Afghanistan not Iraq and protected by the Taliban who ran that country President Bush had no choice but to attack Afghanistan . By the late spring of 2002 both the Al-Qeada and Taliban together with their leaders Osama Bin-Laden & Mullah Omar escaped the pursuing US and allied forces by getting themselves lost into the rugged mountains on the Afghan / Pakistan border . Bush used only 11 , 000 US troops in that war , less then there are policemen on the island of Manhattan , against a country bigger and more populated then the state of Texas . By the summer of 2002 the Bush Administration started to mass US troops in Kuwait for the invasion of the real target on their radar scope Saddam's Iraq . The Bush Administration together with the cooperation of the US media started to plant stories of Iraq being responsible for the attacks by being allied with Osama Bin-Laden's Al-Qeada . The American public was also told that Iraq had possession of WMD , Weapons of Mass Destruction , and would use then on it's neighbors as well as the United States . After months of pounding these rumors into the minds of the American public on March 19 , 2003 Bush and his Neocon / hawks finally got their wish as the US invaded Iraq , something that GW Bush & Co . wanted since they took office back on January 20 , 2001 . The Iraqi war has already cost the lives of some 12 to 15 thousand Iraqi's and almost 1 , 000 US servicemen and is still going on with no end in sight . The Commission has come out with a statement that Iraq had nothing at all to do with the attacks on America and found no evidence that Iraq had WMD . Michael Moore exposed the crude propaganda of the Bush / Neocons in going to war in Iraq as well as attacking anyone , like himself , who's against that war as being unpatriotic . Moore does this by showing us those GI's who were severely wounded in that war at a local veterans hospital which the US media never shows and which we hardly if ever see or hear Bush or members of his administration visit . Since the start of the war in Iraq Bush with the majority of the congress cut as much as 60 % of veterans benefits behind the scenes . while in public Bush & Co . claimed to be such big supporters of our fighting men and women and that anybody who was against their policies in Iraq were bad for the troops fighting and dying there and responsible for the losses that they are suffering in Iraq . Even though those against the war want the US servicemen not to be in that country and suffer the casualties that they are suffering there in the first place . Like the wounded GI's in the veterans hospital the Bush Administration as well as the US media refuses to show the returning flag-draped coffins of dead US servicemen coming back from Iraq as well as Afghanistan , it's just too depressing for the American public to see were told by them . Even though Michael Moore leaves out the footage of the brutal attacks from his movie he does have the very graphic and bloody footage of the fighting in Iraq . The shocking scenes of dead and wounded US servicemen and Iraqi civilians and soldiers made many in the theater watching the movie turn away from the screen . Of all the 535 members in the US congress only one has a son serving in Iraq . At the end of the movie Michael Moore with a US Marine recruiter by his side goes to the Capital Building in Washington D . C . trying to get the sons and daughters of the Congressmen and Senators , who for the most part support the war in Iraq , to voluntarily go fight and die in the war that they seem to be so supportive of : to no ones surprise there were no takers .
