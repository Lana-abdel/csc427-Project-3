568228	2721657	138094	3.0	Take Off My Clothes ! What Are You Some Kind Of NUT ! ! !	( Some Spoilers ) More like a home movie then anything else " The Sex Killer " plot is your run of the mill sex pervert film with nothing to recommended it but a number of pretty girls , who for the most part end up getting strangled , and a look at the grimy streets and red light district of Manhattan circa the mid 1960's . Tony who works in a mannequin warehouse in the Garment District of New York City is a bit shy with women having trouble making any connection or striking up any relationship with them . We see at the start of the movie Tony going into a camera store and buying a pair of binoculars that he later uses to spy , from the safety of a high-rise buildings rooftop , on young women sunbathing in the nude . Getting all hot and worked up seeing all these busty young women , who seem to be posing for him , from his porch on top f the high-rise Tony get up enough nerve t go down to Times Square and pick up a hooker . Tony's encounter with the hooker turns out to be a total dud with him not having enough money to have any action with her . All the hooker allows Tony , who only has $10 . 00 on him , to do is watch her undress and nothing more . It's then that something inside Tony's sick minds snaps and sets him off to stalk down and murder a number of young women , including the hooker whom he picked up , mostly in their apartments that Tony breaks into . The film " The Sex Killer " runs it's predictable course with Tony getting more and more careless every time he gets away with murdering his victims . Tony in order to satisfy his sick sexual urges also rapes and violates the womens after he murders them having him dubbed by the local newspapers and police as the " New York Necrophilia Rapist / Killer " . Breaking again into a young woman's apartment in order to satisfy his now out of control and inflamed libido Tony ends up getting caught when she escapes from his clutches . Running out of her apartment and into the hallway , totally nude , the young woman together with a good neighbor , who gave her a robe to cover up , get a hold of a cop outside the building to arrest the murderous pervert . Chasing Tony up on the roof the cop pulls no punches , as he pulls out his revolver , blasting Tony and causing him to fall some 20 floors to his death below . Tony for his part was a very sick young man who desperately needed help to control and cure his uncontrollable and dangerous sexual desires . Unfortunately Tony didn't seek help and it was after he crossed that point of no return when he went from watching to murdering the women that turned him on that there was no help that society , other then long stretch behind bars or a cops bullet in his chest , could offer him .
567967	2721657	66845	3.0	Horror Hotel	SPOILERS With a gathering of family members and servants of the late Christopher Dean , John Carradine , to hear his last will and testament they get somewhat of a surprise in that the Dean fortune , some 140 million dollars . The money is to be divided between them but only after they successfully spend a week at the Dean mansion . There seemed to have been a mix-up in the story when we later find out that it's really an overnight sleepover , not a weeks vacation , at the mansion for the guests to qualify for Dean's money since almost everyone ends up dead by sunrise . The first victim of the Dean Curse have nothing at all to do with getting and money from the departed Christopher Dean estate the local sheriff Dan Garcia , Rodolfo Acosta . Acosta has his head chopped off refrigerated and then served on a platter to a shocked group of guests . Later that evening cute little Chin Greg and Laura's , Jeff Morrow & Marry Anders , little pet pooch is found dead outside floating in the pond . The movie has all the people staying at the Dean Mansion being picked off one by one until it's revealed who the killer really is . We then have what seems to be a double-twist in the story where the original killer is suddenly killed together with two of the last remaining guest . The real killer ends up not only getting all the loot , 140 million dollars , but then ends up not having to split it with his accomplice by doing him , or her , in by giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spot . Nonsensical who done it , and haunted house , movie with a cast of such immoral and unlikable characters that even a mother , much less the audience , would have trouble liking . There's everything you can possibly think of in the move involving the selective guests that includes incest S & M sadism and of course double-dealing and back-stabbing not even counting murder . You just couldn't care less who of the guests survives to collect the Dean fortune at the end of the movie hoping against all hope then none of them do . Even the big surprise at the end isn't really that much of a surprise since the killer's identity is divulged with the film-maker having forgotten to keep his face in the shadows so you actual see who he is even before he reveals himself ! We then have a plot-twist that eliminates the killer together with a number of remaining guest just to make the movie a little more confusing then it already is . The final plot-twist , that you can see coming from as far as ten miles away , was just to show how smart the very obvious killer was which fooled almost nobody watching the movie .
568718	2721657	70435	4.0	Brain Drain	SPOILERS Sloppy and confusing haunted house movie that seems to have been spliced together by a bunch of film editors who were high on Johnny Walker Black . Nothing in the film " A Name for Evil " makes any sense including it's " Suprise Ending " which is no surprise at all since like the rest of the movie it predictably makes no sense to those of us watching it . Robert Culp as John Blake looks more confused and disoriented in the film then scared as the owner of " The Major's " place that was left to him by his great-granddaddy " The Major " who was a captain in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War . There's also a very unemotional scene , on John's part , at the funeral of John's younger brother Moss who was killed during the fighting in the War in Vietnam which has , or seems to have , nothing to do with the movie . At the start of the film " A Name for Evil " we have John quit his job as a big city architect and check out to the Vancouver countryside into his great-granddad " The Major's " place . John wants to get away from the dog-eat-dog world that he's been living in all his adult life thats been burning him out . At first you think that John's wife Joanna , Samantha Eggar , wasn't going with him since she thought he was a bit too hasty in his plans . Later Joanna pops up , like a ghost , at " The Major's " place and together with John they both start to get the place fixed up where they can live in it . John also gets Fats , Mike Lane , the local hotel manager car mechanic cook and all around handyman to have a number of the towns locals to also help fix up " The Major's " place . We later see workmen discover a hidden room in " The Major's " place where'The Major " kept his most secret papers and documents that hasn't been touched for some fifty years . Were never told just what was the reason for them being there in the first place , wasn't anyone interested in finding out what was in them ? Later a bunch of John and Joanna's friends stop over at " The Major's " place for the weekend to talk about old times . John , bored with the meaningless chit-chat goes outside and sees " The Major's " white horse , who if alive must have been close to 100 years old . Without a second thought John suddenly jumps on it's back and rides into town as it dumps John inside the local bar . Getting up off the floor John parties with the people there in a drunken orgy ! Was there supposed to be some hidden symbolism in this totally senseless scene ? Striking up a friendship with local girl Luanna Baxter , Sheila Sullivan , John and Luanna end up both drunk and in bed together the next morning from the all night partying . Going back to " The Major's " with his car , not his horse , John is surprised shocked confused , like all of us watching the movie , and finally outraged by Joanna's accusations of him brutalizing and beating her up the night before ! Being that John was with Luanna at the time he tells Joanna that she's nuts for saying what she did about him and that he could prove that he didn't . That truth by spending the night with Luanna was almost as bad , in Joanna's mind , as abusing and beating her . John in a fit of fury drives back to town to get Luanna to prove his innocence which sets up the films " Suprise Ending " that confuses you even more then you were confused already by the movie up till then . " A Name for Evil " is both an eyesore and headache to anyone trying to watch and understand just what it's trying to tell you which only those who wrote the script really know for sure . . I Think ?
568153	2721657	120724	4.0	Knock on Wood	SPOILERSMind boggling action movie that takes place on the eve of the British colony city of Hong Kong being handed over to the Red Chinese . The movie is about this group of Russian international mobsters who plan to blackmail the world with thousands of button , or micro , bombs . The Russians hide them in knockoff , phony high priced and name item , clothes and electrical equipment as well as toys . Then threaten to detonate them if they aren't paid , like cable TV , a monthly fee of 100 million dollars . Jean-Clude Van Damme is Marcus Ray a shady businessman who exports knockoff running shoes and jeans who gets involved up to his neck in the action . This happens when it's found out that his partner in crime the lovable and wise-cracking Tommy Hendricks , Rob Schneider , is an undercover CIA agent planning to get the goods on him , as well as his associates , in the illegal knockoff business . It soon becomes evident that knockoffs aren't the only headache on the minds of the CIA . It's found that their , the knockoff clothes and toys , are being used as explosives by the Russian mobster and suddenly Ray becomes a good guy in stopping , together with Hendricks , that from happening . Still Ray is hamstrung by ambitious CIA agent Karen Lee , Lela Rochon , who's playing double-agent in the film . This confuses both Ray & Hndricks to the point where all thee almost end up shooting each other . SPOILER ALERTIt turns out that the person behind this evil and grandiose plan is non other then the CIA chief in charge of covert Hong Kong operations himself chubby Harry Johnson , Paul Sorvino , who together with even chubbier Hong Kong crime kingpin Slim , Glen Chin , are working together with the evil Russians in this crazy and off the wall criminal venture . The mindless action is almost non-stop in the movie with Ray going from rickshaw races to food fights and warehouse shootouts and finally a showdown with the Russians . This happens on an outgoing freighter loaded with bomb laden ripoffs headed for US Pacific port cities to unload and , by remote satellite control , activate them . People in the movie seem to be killed over and over again coming back for more like walking dead zombies especially the Russian mobsters . Who have , for what at first seems like no reason at all , hoods over their heads . Later you realize that it , the hoods , were just there so you won't see or recognize them coming back to get themselves killed , by Ray & Co , all over again sometimes as much as three or four times . The leader of the Slavic mobsters himself is done in a number of times by both Ray & Lee only to come back for more . Thats until Ray , out of sheer frustration , finally finishes him off much like he would have done to a vampire . But not with the usual wooden stake driven through his heart but with a ten ton steel cargo container dropped square on top of his head ! All kinds of wild and far out zany camera angles make you dizzy following the non-stop action scenes with bad guy CIA turncoat Johnson getting the worst of it . Johnson gets knocked around all over the place then set on fire , with a bottle of deadly sulfuric acid , and then killed in a freighter explosion . Just when you thought the movie and Johnson were history he again killed in another explosion in his Hong Kong hideout . Johnson who at that point seemed to have come back from the dead has the same crazed and manic look in both scenes in both scenes that he was killed .
568861	2721657	357507	4.0	Boogie Woogie	SPOILERS Better then average special effects can't make up for the almost unintelligible story-line of the movie " Boogeyman " that seems to take young Tim , Barry Watson , into a kind of astral world where time and space as well as logic are non-existent . We first get to see Tim as an eight year-old boy terrified of the dark and feeling that there's some Boogeyman hiding in his bedroom closet . His dad , Charles Mesure , trying to convince young Tim that it's all in his imagination is suddenly scooped up by some unseen force and dragged into Tim's closet never to be seen again . Nothing seemed to have happened to Tim for the next 15 or so years until one Thanksgiving weekend where he at first gets some strange and eerie feeling that his mother , Lucy Lawless , who's confined to a hospital bed is going to die . Sure enough while spending the weekend at his girlfriend Jessica , Tory Musseh , family home Tim gets a call from the hospital that his mom passed away . Talking to his late mother's physician Dr . Mathesow , Robyn Calcolm , Tim is told that the best way for him to get over his grief and self-guilt about not being at his mother's bedside is to spend a night at her home ; the very place where Tim's fear of the dark and enclosed places , like closets , originated from . Meeting an old high school friend Kate , Emily Deschanel , at his mom's funeral Tim later has her come over at the deserted house where she undergoes the same terrors that Tim does . We also get to meet young and cute little Fanny , Skye McCole Bratuslak , hanging around the house as if she were a ghost . Fanny also seems to know a lot about the strange and unexplained goings on in the house with scores of little boys and girls like her materializing out of nowhere . Later Tim finds out that Fanny was a missing child since 1985 from a poster she had in her satchel and in the photo she didn't look a day older then she is now ! We then also get to see Tim's girlfriend Jessica unexpectedly show up at the house with both of them taking off for a motel only to have Tim , minus Jessica , back at his mom's house when he walks through a door in his motel room ! There's nothing in the movie that explains what exactly Fanny and Jessica were doing in Tim's mom's house and later we don't exactly know if Jessica was in fact killed even though we see her drowning in the bathtub at the motel . This all comes across more as an hallucination that a real event in Tim's now very disturbed and unbalanced mind . As for the sweet and mysterious little Fanny she disappears from the movie almost as fast as she at first appeared in it . It's then when the floodgate opens with the thing in he closet , or Boogeyman , coming out into the open with both Tim and Kate , whom you almost forgot about , battling it out with him for the movies big and very confusing final sequence . The only way you can make any sense out of the film is by explaining it away as some kind of paranoid induced vision on Tim's part in taking over his mind and distorting his sense of reality . If you try to rationalize what happened as fact you may very well end up in the same state of mind that Tim was in the movie and even in a bed next to his in the hospital mental therapy ward .
568489	2721657	93676	4.0	The high cost of living and low cost of dying in L .	( Some Spoilers ) Dull as dishwater slasher flick that has this deranged homeless man Harry , Darwyn Swalve , out murdering real-estate agent all over the city of L . A because of the high prices that they charge for their proprieties . Looking like an extra from a Clint Eastwood " Spaghetti Western " Harry who's been living in abandoned houses eating dog food get's very upset where his quite lifestyle as a squatter is interrupted . This happens when a number of real-estate agents invaded his space in an attempt to sell the houses , that he's staying at to their potential clients . Joseph Bottome stars in this bottom-of-the-barrel horror movie as radio talk-show host Dr . David Kelly the handsome and popular host psychologist of the KDRX survival line . DR . Kelly is being sued by the family of one of his callers , Tracy , who ended up blowing her brains out while on the air with the doc who couldn't do anything to help her survive her ordeal of taking to him . The real-estate killer gets to talk with Dr . Kelly on the air about his adventures and the police try to get the doc to get his phone number and address , by keeping him on the line , but he refuses to in order not to hurt his rating by having potential callers not call in in fear of being monitored by the LADP . Kelly also is having a hot and heavy affair with a real-estate manager and agent the busty Lisa Grant , Adrienne Barbeau , who's office of sellers are Harry's main victims in he movie . Harry also gets to murder Lisa's main competition in the housing business the chubby and outrageous Barney Resnick , Barry Hope , who threatened to put Lisa out of business by any means possible even if he has to kill her . Getting Berney alone and with his pants down Harry slices his head off while he's being entertained by one of his clients , a hooker , whom he leaves dead and hanging together with the headless Barney . The movie ends with the deranged Harry taking Lisa hostage and having Dr . Kelly try to come to her rescue only to have Det . Shapiro ( Robert Miano ) , looking like e hasn't slept in a week , pop out of nowhere and blow Harry's brains out . Harry quickly come back to life minus the gay matter between his ears and gets himself killed for the second time in the movie by being thrown from a balcony and landing on the ground as a dozen members of the LAPD , M16 cocked and ready , come on the scene . Nothing in the movie " Opean House " worked with the tension laughable to almost non-existent . Even the hot sex scenes between Dr . Kelly and Lisa didn't save the movie since there were far too few , only two , of them and and sexy Adrienne Barbeau was a bit too underexposed , with not enough light and too much clothes on , in all of them . Harry the killer in the movie was also a bit to comical to be taken seriously in trying to make a point , to Dr . Kelly on the phone and in person , about the high rents and real-estate prices in the country and how people like himself find it almost impossible to find a decent place to live in . You can sympathize with Harry's concern about the high cost of living but be very critical of him in how he crazily went on in correcting it .

568299	2721657	95611	5.0	It could have been an animal ? What if it wasn't !	SPOILERS The movie " Memorial Valley Massacre " tries to be different from your average run of the mill killer on the loose films and in a way it succeeded it what it set out to do . The villain in the film a clean shaven cave boy , John Caso , does kill more then half the cast in the movie by the time its over but at the same time you can't hold it against him for what he does . The cave boy we later find out was abandoned by his father and never had a normal childhood . This instilled a deep resentment in the boy for the human race whom he held , together with his dad , responsible for the predicament that he finds himself in : Living in a cave and living off the scraps of tourists who vacation in the valley . All this killing and destruction would not have happened if it wasn't for real-estate tycoon Allen Sangster , Cameron Mitchell , deciding to build a campground in the valley that the cave boy dwelled in . With dozens of campers in the area the cave boy just went wild , in his hatred for civilized man , going on a rampage killing some dozen of them by the time the movie was over . We have to understand the cave boys frame of mind in what he did . Feeling that the campers represented his father the cave boy took it out on them for what his dad did to him by leaving him out in the woods to fend for himself at an early age . Besides the interesting and deep psychological aspects , father and son relationship , of the film the rest of the movie was just too hard to take seriously even if you tried . The cave boy not only survived in the wild for some 17 years he also somehow learned how to drive heavy earth moving equipment , like bulldozers , and how to start fires . Not by rubbing two rocks or sticks together but by releasing gas from a gas-tank and then having the unsuspecting victim light a match blowing himself , and anyone within 50 feet of him , to pieces . The cave boy at first has the local park ranger George Webster , John Kerry , feel that it's a killer bear that's doing all the killing in and around the " Memorial Valley " campground . Together with his assistant Allen Sangster's son David , Mark Mears , Webster sets out to track down the killer bear before he does any more damage . Later when two of the campers bikers Eddie & Leon , Eddie D . & Don S . Fambeau , helping in tracking down the bear instead find the cave boy's home , with scores of human body parts and bones in it , thing really start to get unraveled . The cave boy feeling he's the victim of a home invasion loses it . Mad at what Eddie and Leon did , in stealing his prized skull , the cave boy comes out in the open killing everyone , including Eddie & Leon , that he comes in contact with . The movie ends on a high note , of sorts , with the cave boy finally finding his old man who in fact , instead of abandoning him , was searching for the confused young man all these years . SPOILER ALERT The heart-breaking ending has the cave boy , in his efforts to keep people from finding his secret lair , unwittingly do in his old man . All this happens when father and son were about to reunite , after some 17 years , and forget about the past .
568635	2721657	143296	5.0	Wait this one out	SPOILERS Uneven movie about witchcraft in a small town in Mass . that transcends three centuries . Moving into the small town of Pinecrest Sarah Zoltanne , Sarah Citalik , and her mom Mrs . Resemary Zoltanne , Markie Post , realize that the house that they bought was once the home of a women Sarah Lancaster who was burned at the stake as a witch back in 1660 . Sarah is a very weird type of person dabbling in the occult and being able to make thing happen that have no scientific explanation like being able to know a person by reading his or her palm as well as having doors open and shut by themselves . At her new high-school it turns out that a number of students there are decedents of the people who immolated Sarah Lancaster back in the 17th Century . The students now feel that Sarah , Zoltanne , is the Sarah that was killed by their distant ancestors . Their also certain that she's now come back to exact vengeance on them for what they , or their the ancestors , did to her back then . The movie " I've been waiting for you " borrows a lot from the 1996 Wes Craven horror flick " Scream " . With the killer running around hooded with what looks like a witch mask , unlike the skeleton mask in " Scream " , and has a Freddy Kruger like claw hand as his , or her , weapon of choice . The killer targeting the offspring's of Sarah Lancasters accusers and executioners has Sarah , the present one , check up on the ancestry of those in the town of Piecrest and comes up with a clue to who the killer really is . kidnapped by the frightened high school descendants of Sarahs 17th century killers Sarah is taken outside town to be executed , by fire in order to stop the attacks on them . Only to have the real killer show up and thus exonerate her . The movie has so many loose ends that it at some point seems to be unintelligible to follow . The mysterious black cat Hecuba at first seems to have some connection to what's going on in the film but disappears , after about fifteen minutes into the movie , into thin air as if he were a phantom never to be seen again . The scene with Sarah's mom Rosemary towards the end of the film is also very confusing . With the masked killer stalking her in her house and then attacking her . Which was a bit out of character for the killer since Mrs . Zoltanne wasn't a descendant of young Sarah Lancaster's 17th century executioners , like those who the killer targeted throughout the movie . The ending sequence in " I've been waiting for you " is totally out of place , and makes no sense at all , to what we saw in the film up to then . Were given the impression that Sarah and one of the students were in some way working together in taking out the great - great - great - great - great - great - great - grand children of those who killed Sarah Lancaster back in pre-Revolutionary America . And as the movie ends were chillingly told by them that their grizzly work has only begun .
568938	2721657	95446	5.0	Deary and confusing murder drama set in 1988 West Berlin	SPOILERS Just too hard to follow with too many sub-plots makes " Killing Blue " fall apart long before the movies unsurprising conclusion . That's about as exciting as an attack of insomnia . Berlin homicide inspector Alex Glass is having a bad time with his conscience after he mistakenly shot and injured a little girl in a blotched attempt to arrest a fugitive in a Berlin apartment house . Upset with himself and his work Glass starts to drink and goes into a deep depression over his actions that crippled the girl for life . Glass secretly buys her gifts and presents to make up for what he mistakenly did to her . Even his new assistant Shirley May notices Glass ' ugly demeanor with him treating her worse the the criminals that he deals with every day . It's then that something happens that changes Glass ' attitude when he becomes involved with the drug death of Ennis Warner . That leads right to Berlin District Attorney Michael Karstens doorstep who's daughter Monica was Ennis ' best friend . Being very close to Karstens as both a friend of the lawman Glass took a personal interest in Ennis's death . Finding that Ennis was a street hooker and druggie Glass tracked down her supplier lover and possibly murderer a small-time thug named Jack Miskowski . It turns out that Miskowski was with Ennis the night that she overdosed . The movie then takes a left-turn when high-priced hooker Lisa comes on the scene and Glass , after saving her from a over demanding customer , starts getting it on with her . Only to later find out , from a photo in Lisa's hotel room , that she and Miskowski are lovers as well as being involved in his drug and prostitution racket . It also comes to both Glass and Karsten ' attention that Karstens ' teenage daughter Monica is a junkie and is also getting her drugs from Miskowski just like her late friend Ennis did . Michael in trying to get Monica away from Miskowski's clutches tries to stop her from meeting him but loses track of her only to find Monica the next day at a construction site strangled to death . Miskowski now Monica's suspected killer gets away from Glass and the Berlin police in a sting operation they set up for him . It's then when the movie really turns upside down with Michael secretly meeting with Miskowski at an empty train station . With what at first looks like an exchange is about to be made between the two Miskowski gets a knife in his gut killing him with Michael taking off with a briefcase that the drug dealer had on him . In his car Michael finds out that he was doubled-crossed by the conning Miskowski but it's now too late for him to make things right for himself . Since Miskowski is no longer around to tell him where the " real deal " really is . Murder blackmail and a major plot twist are the main ingredients to this convoluted police crime drama . That has the victim change into the real villain in the film as we see that he's not the goody goody two shoes that we thought that he was a the start of the movie . Michael Karstens had very serious mental and emotional problems that he acted out some time ago and Miskowski somehow got a hold of a number of photos , or took them himself , that he was blackmailing him with . It also came out , unknowingly at the time to the audience , that Monica also knew about her step-father's secret life that in the end lead to her murder . It was Inspector Glass who had an idea of what was the real reason for Miskowski's death . By him keeping it from the public is what brought Michael out in the open and thus expose his reasons for not only killing Miskowski but the real and unnerving reason to why he did it .
568013	2721657	107327	5.0	Too many plots and not enough story	SPOILERS Underdevloped and overdone film that has at least four different plot-lines to it and not enough time , some 90 minutes , to fully explain them . Kate Wilson , Annette O'Toole , has been living with her old and infirmed mom Mrs . Wilson , Eva Marie Saint , since her husband left her without any notice and with a full closet of his dirty laundry . Working as a real-estate agent by day and changing into a red hot party-animal at night has her mom wonder if she actually does spend all her nights away from her at home , chit chatting and playing cards , with her friend Reba like Kate tell her that she does . One afternoon after work Kate , all dressed up to kill , is involved in a minor traffic accident with Betty Carlson and tow-truck driver Gary Smith aka Grafton just happens to come along to fix Betty's flat tire . From hearing them talk Gary finds that they both know each other from the Red Oak Inn . Gary turned on by Betty later sneaks into her house and after trying to rape her knocks her against the bathroom tub killing her . Gary paranoid that he'd be caught , because Kate saw him , is now on a mission to track her down and keep her from permanently talking to the police or anyone else . The movie also tried to cover Kate's relationship with her mom and her pick-ups or boyfriends that she had at the Red Oak Inn . Were given glimpses of Kate's childhood and the circumstances of her baby brother , Lawrence , death that her mom held Kate responsible for . There's also the suicide of her Mrs . Wilson's husband Burton who kill himself shortly after Lawrence's died . On top of all that there's the fact that Gary is a good husband and father but has this hang up with young women who's only way of showing them any affection is by beating their brains out . You put all this together in the movie with two detectives on the case of Betty Carlson's murder who , or at least one of them , acted towards old and sick Mrs . Wilson as if she were a captured Al-Qeada terrorist ! That by the time it was over you had no idea just what it was trying to tell you ? Was there a serial murder on the loose in the town of Santa Rosa ? We were told that earlier in the film but Gary's killing of Betty came later in the movie and for all intents and purposes it was his first , and only , killing and it was also not planned by him but something that went terribly wrong on his part . We also saw later in the film Gary not being able to murder Kate because he just didn't have it in him . So why were we given this red herring about a serial killer / rapist when he never was there in the first place ? There was also a hint in the film of Kate having a lover that she frequently met at the Red Oak Inn . But later , like with Gary , it really didn't pan out since Kate never gave him her real name and was having affairs on the side with other men she met there at the same time she was seeing him .
568116	2721657	109278	5.0	Where's Jack ?	( Some Spoilers ) Having set up his faithful wife Annie , Virgina Madsen , is his own murder as well as implicating her in a 2 . 7 million bank heist that he engineered adulterous ex-cop and bank security guard Jack Westford , Bruce Greenwood , plans to disappear off the face of the earth to live off his ill gotten gains . Jack thinks that he's now home free to flee with his lover , a former teller at the bank that he just robbed , Isbella Martens , Kristen Hockings , to Mexico with the stolen cash . It just turns out that Jack didn't expect Isbella's jealous and hot headed ex-boyfriend Ray Partana , Carlos Gomez , to be casing him out and seeing what he did in framing his wife by staging his own phony murder . Ray now wants payback his former girlfriend Isbella and whatever , Ray doesn't know exactly how much , money Jack histed or else he'll go straight to the local authorities , the cops , and tell them everything that he knows . Doing the stupid thing in confronting Jack , an ex-cop who was fired for brutalizing his prisoners , in his hotel room and demanding payback Ray gets it all right . Ray gets payback for trying to blackmail Jack by ending up with his guts spilling out of his stomach . With the boyfriend now out of the way Jack and Isbella are free take off south of the border with his old lady Annie holding the bag with a count of murder and grand larceny hanging over her head . It's then when Annie get her head and act together by playing junior private investigator and tracking down her rotten and good for nothing of a heel husband Jack ; all this while she was a fugitive from justice . A bit too much to take in Annie changing from a doting and naive suburban housewife into what looks like a tough " Biker Mama " , dressed in both denims and leather . Annie ends up doing what not even the police as well as that sneering full of himself and obnoxious bail bondsman Harry Carven , Eddie Velez , could do ; track down Jack and bring him to final and ultimate justice . Like a female version of the fugitive Annie is on and the run one step ahead of the police all throughout the movie in trying to prove her innocence in her husbands Jack murder . The fact that Jack is suspected in having been murdered by Annie is one thing but how did the cops and bail bondsman Carven , who's to get 20 % of the 2 . 7 million if he recovers it , connect her to the stolen cash ? The half-a explanation by the cops that she and Jack were in on the bank job and there was a falling out between the two , which lead to Annie murdering him , just doesn't wash with both Jack and the money never being found . Couldn't the police put together a far better explanation or scenario in the fact that both Jack & Isbella disappeared almost at the same time , with her quiting her job just two weeks earlier , right after the bank robbery ! In fact it was Annie who after finding a receipt for a diamond ring that her cheating husband Jack bought for his one and only love , whom he later murdered , Isbella proved that they both had the reason and means , by working in the bank , to pull off the robbery which the totally out of the loop and Innocent Annie didn't . Instead of going to the police , this while she was still on the lamb , with this very important piece of evidence Annie instead put her neck on the line tracking down Jack in Mexico to exact bitter vengeance on him for what he did to her . Maybe in Annie's mind this would be far more effective and justified then just having him arrested tried and convicted of his crimes . Crimes that Jack so maliciously concocted and framed her for committing .
568908	2721657	66007	5.0	Hippie Heaven ?	SOME SPOILERS Taking place in the cold and hard winter of 1970 in the slums of Cleveland Ohio instead of the tranquil and pleasant 1967 Summer of Love in the Haight Asbuary district of San Francisco . " Ghetto Freaks " is a film that tries to show it's viewers the life and philosophy of a hippie commune and how it , lead by their Guru Sonny , goes through life on the mean streets of a large northern industrial city . Sonny who's having trouble keeping the women members of his hippie group from not trying to form any meaningful relationship with him is also being pressured by his former drug supplier Billy Moose to get back pushing his junk on the streets and to his fellow hippies . We see at the beginning of the movie Sonny and his friends doing their thing and then being run in by the Cleveland Police for unlawful assembly in a local park . Getting out within hours after their arrest the hippie's go back to their loft and start to get high on pot and do sex as well as plan their next move in their war against the establishment ; which is demonstrating against the war in Vietnam and the exploitation of the masses by those in power . There's nothing really new in the movie we get a number of songs and orgies along with the hippies dancing to them . There's this scene of a young hippie girl afraid of being pregnant , it turned out she wasn't , and high on drugs feeling that she's about to give birth to a new planet , or world , instead of a baby . Later in the movie at a hippie nightclub with Sonny & friends the police raid the place to find Diana , a teenage runaway , who's parents want to prevent from going into the hippie lifestyle and ending up a drug addict or even worse . Sonny spotting the young and pretty Diana , between tripping out and having sex with his hippie girlfriend Clara , takes a shine to her and slips Diana his name and address for future reference . The next day Diana shows up at Sonny's pad asking him to take her in as a fellow hippie which Sonny does without as much as a second thought . Giving Diana the lowdown on what's expected of her by him and his fellow hippies getting high on drugs and having unrestricted sex as well as panhandling to get money to pay the rent . Diana immediately get involved in a drug induced sex session with him that ends up with the entire group joining in . Out on the bitter cold streets of downtown Cleveland Sonny and his gang , including Diana , are later seen hassling and pestering pedestrians for money handing out what looks like super-marker flayers to people for whatever anyone , insane enough to buy them , would pay for them . This entire scene looks like it was filmed on the spot with the unsuspecting people on the street , not knowing that they'll end up in the movie . The hassled and pestered pedestrians for the most part let Sonny and his friends have it about getting a job a bath and out of their faces . Sonny who seemed to have become a hippie to get away from his previous life as a drug pusher has been given the word , by his fellow hippie Mousey , that his former boss Billy Moose want's to talk to him about getting back as one of his drug dealers . Billy Moose feeling that his hippie friends would be a study source of income in buying his junk . Sonny , now a reformed man , want's no part of Billy Moose or his drugs . Being a man that doesn't take no for an answer Billy Moose has his thugs work over Sonny leaving him unconscious with a possible fractured skull . The next day we see Sonny , and his fellow hippies , without a mark on him out in the park again demonstrating against the " Evil Establishment " and almost getting beat up or run in by the very angry upright and working-class people . The very people who Sonny & Co . are supposed to be demonstrating for . Things get a bit confusing when we then see Billy Moose with his head bashed in and face black and blue getting his boys together to knock off Sonny claiming that he was the one who beat him up . I got the impression that Billy Moose got his injuries from getting high and then falling on his head breaking it ! Since we never saw Sonny lay as much as a hand on Billy Moose in the entire movie ! Unless this assault on Moose was supposed to have happened off screen or ended up being edited out of the film ! Determined to do in Sonny Billy Moose spots him and his fellow hippies , including Diana , walking down the street one evening and opens fire on them hitting and killing Diana . The movie ends with Sonny and his hippie commune friends glumly standing in shock over Diana's body as the police and para medics arrive to take her away to the local morgue . The movie " Ghetto Freaks " tries to show the hippie lifestyle of the late 1960's and early 1970's USA and does a pretty decent job of it . Were not shown that being a hippie was so great like most films with bigger budgets and well know actors and actresses did back then . But were shown instead that it was a dog eat dog existence where every day living in it could be your last like it turned out to be for poor and naive Diana .
568477	2721657	783239	5.0	Were going on our honeymoon in Hawaii !	MAJOR SPOILERS Supposedly based on a true story the made for TV movie " Engaged to kill " is so off the wall and unbelievable that , if in fact it did happen in real life , it goes to prove the famous saying that " Truth is in fact stranger then Fiction " . The movie starts off with a run of the mill kidnapping of pediatrician Abby Lord who's kidnapper demands from her husband-luxury boat salesman-Robert a cool million dollars if he even want's to see his wife alive again . Not going to the police but going broke in rustling up the ransom Robert together with his 14 year-old son Corey drop off the cash , in an out of the way garbage can , in the designated spot that the kidnapper told him to . Whaterver believability the movie had up until then totally evaporated with the actions of both the kidnapped victim and the kidnapper . Abby , who was supposed to be released anyway , makes her escape from the kidnapper's trailer with the kidnapper's girlfriend Sally getting killed , by falling out of the trailer and getting crushed , in trying to prevent her from escaping . It's then that the kidnapper decides to get even not only with Abby but her entire family by secretly bankrupting them as well as causing Abby to lose her job at the hospital ! This is all done by the kidnapper getting Abby's patients with the help of his accomplice-Sullivan - to accuse her of malpractice . SPOILER It's when the kidnapper , whom were not supposed to know who he is , finally shows up on the scene it becomes obvious just what he's planning to do . Get in good by being Abby's daughter's , Maddy , boyfriend and destroy the Lord family from within ! Of course this sleazy and smirking lowlife isn't up to accomplishing his mission by himself he has help in this mindless goon-Sullivan-that he hired to do most of the dirty , as well as murders , for him ! Everything is so predictable , especially the identity of the kidnapper , that there's no suspense at all in the movie . The only thing that surprises you is just how ridicules the kidnapper was and how he was able fool , among his victims , anyone in the first place . I for one couldn't understand the attachment he had to his airhead girlfriend Sally since he used her , like he did everyone else in the movie , for his own advantage and nothing more . As for the Lord family it was only Abby who finally got the drop on him but not in her realizing that he was in fact the person who kidnapped her ! But in Abby finding the smirking psycho playing - a game of internet poker - with her son's Cory's personal computer ! The ending of the movie was a totally mindless confrontation between the kidnapper with both Abby and her daughter Maddy whom he planned to slice up and force Abby to watch bleed to death . It's then that the crazed lunatic for no reason at all , but just to show how crazy he is , dropped his gun only to end up getting clobbered , with a polo stick , and put to sleep until the police came to finally put him away !
568652	2721657	55452	5.0	Pornography : A nasty word for a dirty business .	One of Ed Wood Jr . lesser known works about the smut racket where Wood himself has a cameo role in it . Not as the cop in drag with a tight womens wool sweater , which would have been more like it for Wood , but as a smut peddler having it out with his rival at a pizza joint that fronts for a porno distribution site . With a number of young women found dead in and around a local park their deaths are connected to a local smut ring headed by Gloria Henderson . Things get real bad for Gloria when the cops take into custody her top smut photographer Jaffe together with all the canisters of porno films , that he hid in his closet . Leaving her racket on the verge of being shut down not just by the cops but by the syndicate who are bankrolling her smut operation . The weak link in Gloria's smut business is one of her enforcers Dirk Williams who becomes so hopped up and morally corrupted by having a hand in her smut racket . Dirk he goes bananas when he sees porno films and pictures that he's peddling supplied by Gloria's right-hand man in her business the former legit Hollywood film maker Johnny Ryde . Dirk's uncountable urge for sex and violence is touched off just by the sight of smut photos and that drives him to commit rape and murder . The local cops know all about Gloria's operation but need solid proof and evidence to put her , together with Johnny Ryde , out of business . In the end it's Gloria herself who provides all the rope that they need to hang her without Gloria even knowing it . Director Ed Wood does the best he can to show the evils of pornography and how it effects naive and innocent young girls who come to Hollywood looking to make it big in the motion picture industry . Only ending up getting talked into making porno films by the likes of Gloria and Johnny Ryde to just pay off their bills . We see the tragic story of Mary Smith who ended up making smut films and photos for Gloria and finally fell victim to Dirks sinister urge . When he caught Mary alone in the park , by the duck pond , and ended up raping and murdering her . We also see in the movie " The Sinister Urge " how difficult it is to arrest the likes of Gloria Henderson and make the charges of the crimes she committed stick . Admittedly a laughable venture , which of his movies aren't , of Wood's because of the cheap budget and in some cases non-actors in it . The movie " The Sinister Urge " is still years ahead of it's time thanks to the foresight and vision of it's director Ed Wood Jr , in showing the evils and horrors of the then , in 1961 , underground and illegal smut business in and out of Hollywood . That destroyed the lives of thousands of young girls like Mary Smith in mind as well as body .
568105	2721657	356618	5.0	Lost In Space	SPOILERS After Telly Paretta's , Julianne Moore , nine year-old son Sam , Christopher Kovaleski , died in a plane crash , with five fellow grade-school students , over a year ago she just can't get him out of her mind . Having hundreds of photos and over a dozen video tapes of Sam and a whole room of Sam's clothes and toys is enough to keep Telly's mind occupied for the rest of her life with him . This obsession on Tellys part has her husband Jim , Anthony Edwards , have her see psychiatrist Dr . Jack Munce , Gary Sinise , for help . Telly later gets to know former hockey great Ash Correll , Dominic West , who according to Telly also lost his young daughter Lauren , Kathryn Faughan , in the plane crash that killed Sam . Ash even though he puts up with Telly's obsession about her son Sam he seems to be just playing along with her . Ash has no idea to what she's talking about since he never had a child , son or daughter , as Telly insists that he did ! Or did Telly and Ash really have children and somehow had their memories erased about them ! In the case with Telly it , the brainwashing , didn't work . It later turns out that all the photos tapes and memories that Telly has about Sam are just figments of her imagination and that Sam and Lauren as well as the other four children who " supposidly " were killed in the plane crash didn't exist at all , or did they ? Just as you think that you got a handle on whats happening the movie takes an abrupt turn . Telly not only realizes that Sam actually existed and may even be alive . Ash , in a rare moment of sobriety for him , soon also realized that Lauren existed after all ! With him yelling hysterically to Telly " I Remember ! " We then go from an interesting stolen memory-type movie to an off-the-wall and confusing episode of an X File-like TV series with both Telly and Ash on the run for the rest of the film . Telly and Ash are chased all through the movie by a bunch of government and local city goons who we see as cops and NSA agents but seem to be really be aliens from another planet . Putting together the story as best as I can I get the impression that those involved in Sam and Laurens disappearance are really aliens from outer space here on earth , working with those in power , by making some kind of experiments on them in genetics . Like breeding them into some kind of alien / human hybrids , and then taking them back to their home planet and having the victims parents , like Telly & Ash , have their memories expunged of ever knowing them . These goons are obvious not human since they can withstand being hit , at full speed , by a car and then walk away without as much as a nosebleed . These " Secret Agents " even take as much as a half dozen shots from a . 38 or 9mm handgun and walk away as if they were hit by nothing harder then a rubber band . The movie just seems to lumber on making little or no sense at all with both Telly and Ash always a step ahead of their pursuers . Ash gets so drunk that the only time he's not drinking or inebriated is when he out cold asleep and too incapacitated to pick up a bottle or shot glass and gulp it down . There's two endings where , in Telly being confronted by one of these " aliens " at an airport hanger , to the movie " The Forgotten " . One that was in the theater release print and the other , an alternative ending on the DVD . Both of them make no sense at all and have you wonder if the movie is just that bad or some kind of Hollywood in-joke played of the unsuspecting theater audience .
568086	2721657	119732	5.0	A Betrayal of Trust	SPOILERS Suspected of murdering her husband Peter , Jimmy Smits , and the live-in , handyman Charlie , Gailard Sartain , Caroline Walker , Mary-Louise Parker , is being interrogated at the police station when she is appointed a court psychiatrist Dr . Ellis , Nigel Hawthorne . Dr . Ellis tries to help her remember what happened in the three hours at the Walker Estate up to the time of the double-murders that night . Going to Dr . Ellis ' office the next day he puts her under hypnosis to help Caroline by regressing her back in time to the point where she married Peter and then back to the night of his and Charlie's murder . We see that Caroline's marriage to Peter was anything but happy with Peter holding Caroline responsible for forcing him to marry her by tricking him into getting her pregnant . Peter was driven to marry Caroline to prevent any scandal that would hurt his high standing in the community that he built up over the years . Peter was anything but a perfect husband to Caroline always yelling at her and even smacking her around at times even though he strove for perfection in everything that he did in his social life as well as his many business ventures to impress his rich and high powered friends and acquaintances . Peter was also very rude and nasty to Charlie , the live-in handyman at his estate , by insulting and putting him down at every opportunity . Charlie being a good-natured and sweet as well as at times a very hapless person could do nothing but take Peter's abuse and at the same time try to learn how to live with it . As Dr . Ellis slowly brought Caroline forward to that night when her husband Peter and Charlie were found murdered . Surprisingly we find out that she indeed was innocent of those crimes . Dr . Ellis ' expert testimony at Caroline's murder trial is what convinced the jury to find her not guilty but the policeman who handled the case Det . Holloway , Jason Scott Lee , felt that she did murder Peter and Charlie . But now that Caroline was vindicated by a jury of her peers there was nothing that he could do . Soon after the jury verdict the truth comes out about the murders and it turns out that Caroline's mind was purposely blocked by the real murderer and he wasn't the person that we in the audience as well as those in the movie were lead to believe he was . Confusing movie with a number of ridicules flash-backs that had in most cases nothing to do with the story that we were seeing on the screen . The flash-backs popped up mostly at inopportune times in the movie and looked like most of them were left on the cutting-room floor because they didn't fit into the films plot . Also there was so many close-ups of Mary-Louise Parker's big brown eyes that it made me in watching the movie more hypnotized then she was by Dr . Ellis . The overly contrived conclusion of the movie spoiled whatever there was left of the plot and tension in the film . The really off-the-wall ending left you totally stupefied , just like Det . Holloway was with his jaw dropping and eyes wide open and looking flabbergasted at the end of the film .

For whatever reasons the movie makers had in mind this mysterious " Ted " is never seen or heard from during the entire film even though he's mentioned more times then anyone else in it ! Could the name " Ted " have been some kind of inside joke , on the part of the actors and crew , or was he just edited out , on the cutting room floor , in order to save on production costs ? The movie seems to go absolutely nowhere for the first half hour until Eva , Marie-Josee Colburn , suggests that the by now bored to tears young people play a Ouija-Board like game called " Dead Mary " . The game has each of Eve's friends go into the darkened bathroom , with a lighted candle , and speak out the name " Dead Mary " in the mirror three times . It's then that things start to liven up in the movie with almost everyone ending up dead when this evil spirit takes over the bodies of the persons playing the game . The spirit causes those whom it gains control of to first go insane and then go out and kill each other ! What the movie " Dead Mary " does is have the evil spirit not only take over the bodies of the persons in it but give them an insight to their cheating on each others which seem to be , to those involved , far greater then them being brutally murdered . Matt , Jefferson Brown , the first victim of this horror ends up being dismembered in the woods yet is still alive , when he's found , to talk all kinds of gossip about his friends in them cheating on each others girlfriends and boyfriends . Those who find Matt are far more shocked and startled in the revelations he brings out about them then in Matt's obviously desperate condition in him being , besides a talking head , in pieces all over the forest floor ! it's then that each of persons at the cabin start to go off the deep end in not trusting each other and thus ending , in order not to be killed by the evil spirit , doing each other in ! What makes " Dead Mary " worth watching is the dark and eerie photography that has you feeling that , like those in the film , your in some kind of ghostly forest where it never stops raining . The acting is also a lot better then you would expect in a slasher movie like " Dead Mary " with those in it actually acting like grown ups with real problems not just jumping in bed with each other at every given opportunity . Besides the aforementioned actors and actresses there's also Kim , Dominique Swain , who's about the only person in the film who keeps from cracking up and letting herself being controlled by " Dead Mary's " evil spirit . The same can't be said for everyone else in the movie who end up losing it , their minds and lives , when they unconsciously let " Dead Mary " take them over .

Setting Jack up with a spiked bottle of champaign and a hit-man , Jeff Bowser , if he felt like staying off the sauce that evening . As usual like everything else in the movie things get screwed up when Helen shows up , dressed all in black , for the party .

( There are Spoilers ) Revenge insanity and murder is the menu in the movie " The Ex " that has successful architect David Kenyon played by a John Cassavetes looking Nick Mancuso who's being stalked together with his wife Molly , Suzy Amis , and five year-old son Michael , Hamish Tildesley , by his deranged ex-wife Deldre , Yancy Butler . Deldre just released from a mental institution is now back in town to make her Ex-husband David's life as miserable as possible . Working out for hours at a time at the local gym Deldre had developed a hard as rock body and uses it not only to attract men but , after taking them up to her hotel room , to beat their heads into the bathtub wall and then drown them . David seeing that Deldre is making his life a living hell tries to talk her out of harassing him and his family David also wants Deldre to get help before she ends up killing herself together with those she feels are a threat to her , but to no avail . Deldre is hell-bent to destroy Daivd's marriage and career even if it kill her . The movie has Deldre impersonate her psychiatrist Dr . Lillian Jonas , Babs Chula , to get to Molly and her rambunctious son Michael without David knowing about it . Finding out the truth about Deldre's plan David kicks her out of his home . Later Deldre traps David in a number of very sticky situations with her attempting to jump out of her hotel window that David saves her from doing . Deldres action left her body black and blue which has her going to Molly , and the police , telling her that David attacked beat and raped her . Having a video tape of her and David involved in an S & M session while they were married Deldre uses it to prove that he's a pervert and sexual degenerate . All this has David's attorney Mr .

Later things begin to turn sour on her with Deldre and her grand master plan of destruction , that took seven year to dream up formulate and put into motion , going down in flames as the movie comes to an end . Not at all that convincing the movie " The Ex " is a bit to heavy-handed in it's theme about a woman out to get her ex-husband with him not at all that sympathetic . David was , until he met and married Molly , on the same path of self-destruction as Deldre was in his wild lifestyle of drugs sex and all night partying and drinking binges . It was that David's Ex-wife Deldre was so much worse then he was that he didn't come across so unlikable and sleazy .
568429	2721657	68967	5.0	Whoever did it tore them both apart with his fingernails !	( There are Spoilers ) formula TV movie about a werewolf terrorizing a bayou community , Marsh Island , who turns out to be one of it's most respected citizens . David Jassen as the barley awake Sheriff Aaron Whitaker has his work cut out for him in tracking down this ruthless killer who seems to appear and disappear in and out of thin air . At first thinking that the brutal slashing and dismemberment of Ellie Barrifors was the work of a pack of wild dogs in and around the bayou Sheriff Whitaker has a posse rustled up to track down and shoot the canine killers . But later when the unseen killer breaks into the local jail-house and tears to pieces Whitaker's deputy Ted , Robert Phillips , and Ellie's hot-headed brother Larry , Geoffrey Lewis , that Whitaker , and the local townspeople realize that he has a psycho on the loose with the strength of an 800 pound gorilla . It takes a while for the people of Marsh Island to figure out what's happening with the " hairy one " covering up his tracks and causing the entire population to hide in their homes with the doors and windows locked shut . We later learn that the killer is " one of us " but with a sever Blackwater Fever condition that causes him to grow hair and fangs and go out in the woods and bayous hunting for human flesh . Even though we see a number of times in the film the sight of a full moon it doesn't doesn't really have any effect on the killer one way or another as he seems to become a wolf-man not because of it but because of his lack of medication . We finally get a chance to see this wolf-man when he reveals himself while in the hospital for his , among his many other medical problems , sinus condition that caused him to pass out at the smell of burning sulfur . The wolf-man wrecks the entire place and takes off into the woods for some fresh and clean air to relieve his sinuses . Coming back home , to his palatial estate , for the grand final the killer werewolf gets himself killed by what seems like the only person in town who isn't at all interesting in killing him ! But the only person who has the power , with him planting in her room the gun with the blessed silver bullets , to do it . The only thing that turned me off about " Moon of the Wolf " is the depiction of the werewolf himself who was about as scary as any of the characters on Sesame Street . Looking like someone who didn't shave for two weeks with a 1950's greaser-like hairstyle . It would have been much better to keep the werewolf , like in the first half of the movie , in the shadows for the entire movie and let the audiences imagination run wild to what he looks like . Instead of having him reveal himself and showing just how comical looking he really is .
568589	2721657	88008	6.0	Hot Rod Man	SPOILERS Drive-in type movie with bar fights car chases and crashes explosions country music pretty girls badder then bad bad guys and a good guy who's just too good to be true .

Picking up hitch-hiker Johnny Harte , Willem Dafoe , after his car broke down Johnny fixes the Thunderbird so that it can get to the nearest town Bowman Arizona where Beckman can get a new radiator . While at Bowman Beckman and Johnny meet two pretty local girls who happen to be sisters Jesse & Meilssa Duran , Kaaren Lee & Kate Vernon , who really take a shine to them . The boys get a new radiator at Sam's car junkyard and Sam , Stephen Eillott , lets Beckman keep his car in his junkyard garage . Everything seems fine until the three toughs who tried to run Beckman off the road , Hoot Dink & Moss , show up and things really start to get messy . Decent little movie with Willem Dafoe being Mr . Super-Cool as well as a pretty good guitar player . Hoot later beats the hell out of a very drunk Beckman who bet him in a game of pool at the Roadhouse Bar . It's then that Johnny comes to his rescue and ends up smashing up the entire bar in a fight with Hoot . Johnny pays for the damage that he did by going on the stage where his former band just happened to be playing and belt out a song " Marie Marie " that had the bar crowd go wild . Later Beckman decides to enter the " Roadhouse 66 " car race , a race restricted to cars that are pre-1966 models , against Hoot and his gang . It's later that his Thunderbird is set on fire in Sam the junkyard man's garage by Hoot and Sam is killed in the fire trying to put it out . With Jesse giving Beckman her car for the race Johnny who left town to get away from all this excitement and danger later shows up to race in the " Roadhouse 66 " car race with Moss ' car . Moss just had it with both Hoot & Dink after they almost killed him for warning Beckman not to go to the garage where his Thunderbird was set on fire . This time the car race was a lot different then the one at the start of the film with Hoot trying to shoot out Johnny's car engine after he caused Beckman to crash his car in the race . That was after he , Hoot , secretly dropped a scorpion on the front seat that almost stung and killed Beckman . Hoot ends up being up-ended for his effort with his car smashed and him left for dead and losing the race with both Johnny and Beckman ending up with the two girls Jesse and Melissa at the end of the film . It was brought out in the movie that the reason that Hoot gets away , until the end of the movie , with all the trouble that he causes in the town of Bowman is because his dad is a top judge in the state of Arizona . It seemed that his dad didn't teach Hoot a very important lesson about the rule of law that would have saved him a lot of bumps and bruises which is simply : " Crime Doesn't Pay " .
568823	2721657	59199	6.0	Thank God that this time he's on our side	( Some Spoilers ) Updated and modernized version of Mary Shelley's classic " Frankenstein " where the monster is a NASA constructed astronaut named Frank Saunders , Robert Reilly . Frank is slated to be the first " Man " to both travel and land on Mars but things get a bit haywire for him when his rocket is shot down by an alien craft outside the earth's atmosphere . The alien craft contains the last remnants of the Martian civilization that was destroyed in an atomic war . The captain of the craft is Princess Marcuzan , Marilyn Hanold , who's the only surviving woman of the Martain race . With her is the cue-ball headed and giggling Doctor Nadir , Lou Cutell , who's the mastermind in the Princess ' plan to kidnap scores of sexy shapely and child-bearing earth women and use them , with the help of the surviving Martians males , to replenish the dying Martian race . Crash landing in Puerto Rico Frank is attacked by a number of Martian spacemen trying to take him captive . Escaping from the Martians with the left side of his head blown away Frank mindlessly roams the Puerto Rican beaches and countryside trying to get help only to scare to death anyone he runs into . Meanwhile the Martians are quickly grabbing , on the beaches and from tourist hotel swimming pools , dozens of sexy and bikini clad young women to take back home for breeding purposes . It when Frank's creator NASA engineer Dr . Adam Steele , and Frank's human girlfriend also a Nasa employee Karen Grant , Nancy Marshall , track down the confused and frightened brain damaged astronaut that they set him straight . It's then when Dr . Steele reconnects Franks damaged electoral circuit's , that he finally get his act and head together . The highlight of the movie is when Frank in his attempt to save the kidnapped young women is confronted , as a last resort by the Martians , by the space monster a hairy looking creature with what looks like crab or lobster claws . The fight between Frank and the space monster goes on unabated as the women , that includes Karen , make their escape from the spaceship . Grabbing a ray gun from one of the Martian crew members Frank breaks into the captains quarters and finishes off both Princess Marcuzan and Doctor Nadir who are desperately trying to get back to the safety of their home planet Mars . In the end Frank like selfless and brave hero that he is gives up his life by blowing the Martian spacecraft to pieces and thus prevent another Martian invasion of earth in the not so distance future . This is the first and only movie that I can remember where the Frankenstein Monster , Captain Frank Saunders , was actually shown in a positive light where he ends up saving lives instead of taking them . Frank , before he got his head almost blown off , was unlike in the previous Frankenstein movies a fairly good looking guy not the tall nut bolted Golem that were used to seeing since he made his inaugural appearance back in 1931 . It's just too bad that in " Frankenstein meets the Spacemonster " like in all the other " Frankenstein " movies the big guy had to be killed off at the conclusion of the film . It would have been a far better ending if he , after getting his damaged head fixed , would have ended up marrying Karen , thus she becoming the Bride of Frank or Frankenstein , and live happily ever after .

Craig and his Philippine guide , provided to him by Sgt . Sackler , Blanco ( Dale Ishimoto ) hook up with this group of guerrilla's lead by an American named M'Keever , Williams Mims . It turns out that this M'Keever is nothing but a black market hustler who's playing both sides , the Japanese Army and Filipino guerrillas , down the middle and only want's the guns and supplies that Craig would supply to him and his men in order to sell them to the highest bidder . Attacked by M'Keever and his men when he got wise to him Craig and Blanco are then rescued by a real group of Philippine guerrillas lead by their handsome and charismatic leader Julio Fontana , Alejandro Rey . It's later found out to Craig's shock and surprise that his wife Ruth is part of Fontana's guerrilla unit and not only that she's also in loved with him .

With the Japanese attacking both Craig and the people , mostly American civilians , that he's assigned to bring back with him on a US submarine to Australia . Audie , or Craig Benson , is very troubled over his wife leaving him for another man , Julio , but the fact that he was thought to have been killed in the fighting against the Japanese in Battan / Carrigador two years earlier didn't mean that Ruth , whom at the time he was married to for about a week , betrayed or deserted him . With the US submarine delayed in it being spotted by a Japanese cruiser off shore Carig and Sgt . Sackler and about a dozen American and Filipino's hide out on an old battered and run aground ship waiting for either to be rescued by the US Navy or die fighting the Japanese Army .

Later when the Japanses are just about to overrun the ship and kill everyone on it , including Craig's estranged wife Ruth , Craig comes riding to their rescue with a full Philippine guerrilla company who put the Japanese attacker out on their heels and running for their lives . Heart-lifting ending with Ruth deciding to go back with Craig to the US submarine and the safety of friendly Australia instead of staying with Julio in his battle to liberate his people from the Japanese . For a while you would have thought that being with Jullio for some two years in the Philippine jungles would make Ruth forget about Craig , whom she thought was dead anyway . It's when Ruth was reunited with Craig and seeing just what a kind as well as the both modest , which Audie Murphy was in real life , and heroic person that he really was how in all sincerity could she let someone like him , who's just too good to be true , ever get away from her !

Scared to leave for her car Kathryn called for the police to check this guy out . Within minutes a squad car pulled up and out popped the police officers who , after the person refused to open his car door , worked him over to the point where his life was hanging on a thread with the cop in charge Sgt . Brian Kaleen , Fredric Lehne , doing all the dirty work beating him with his baton until he fell limp on the ground like a sack of flour . Kathryn shocked at what she saw , even though it was her who call the police , in the police beating she's later contacted by internal affairs Let . Patkanis , Edward Asner . It turns out that Let . Patkanis has had it in for the brutal Sgt . Kaleen for some time and asked the very reluctant restaurateur to testify against the thug with a badge . At his trail Kathryn's testimony is what convicted Sgt . Kaleen and have him suspended for six months , without pay . Kleen also had his personal file frozen so that he'll never go beyond what he is now , a sergeant , for the entire time that he's is on the police force . Angry and vindictive Kaleen isn't going to take all this , his six month suspension and career frozen in place , lying down and for the rest of the movie he'll make life hell no only for Kathryn but her husband Neil , Dennis Arndt and son Adam , Adam Scott , as well . Kaleen has trumped up sexual harassment charge planted on Neil and also has Kathryn's very troubled young son Adam framed in the brutal murder of a young hooker that he picked up in the city's downtown red-light district . Shocking but not really surprising story of what a corrupt or overly brutal policeman can do with the help of his friends on and off the force to an average citizen who's foolish enough to testify against him and think that his , or in this case her , life will ever be the same again . This is not to say that Kathryn did anything wrong in at first calling the police for help and then reporting the police to the internal affair office for using too much force . It's that the police and local justice departments couldn't offer her , and her family , any help when she stuck her neck out in reporting and testifying against police who are out of control . Somewhat convoluted and feel-good ending doesn't at all erase the pain and suffering that poor Kathryn and her family went through . The two or possible three murders that Sgt . Kaleen and his fellow hoods with badges committed to cover up his crimes did't convince anyone that by going to the police to report a crime will ever ingratiate you with them when you ever need their help you in the future . In fact the dirty cops , like in the movie , will go out of their way to make you regret that you ever reported , and testified in court , a crime to the police that they committed .

Angela's actions go even beyond the crime of physical acts between the campers with her doing in poor Demi , Kendall Dean , just for the crime of talking too much . Like in most slasher movies Angela's victims are murdered for no other reason then her sense of outrage and indignation at their actions .

Angela is a classic case of an out of control sociopath who masked her actions in a false sense of being superior and more principled then those that she did in .

568536	2721657	165498	6.0	Act of God	SPOILERS Not all that bad direct to video movie involving the manipulation of storms and hurricanes by a rouge unit of the CIA . It's this playing God that in the end jeopardizes the city of Los Angeles when the person in charge of this black ops operation Gen . James Roberts , Martain Sheen , is found out , in what he's really up to , by the two top man running the project Doctors Ron Young & Daniel Platt , Luke Perry & David Moses . It turns out that Gen . Roberts has been involved in weather manipulation since he was in Vietnam and now he's doing it here in the US . This has cost over the years hundreds of people to be killed in a number of man made hurricanes , like Andrews in August 1992 , that the General had created with this gadget of his , an in flight electro magnetic generator , in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans . Working secretly with the major oil companies Gen . Roberts is now , without those under him knowing , planning to start up a major five category hurricane , or typhoon , on the west coast of Mexico . This mad plan on Gen . Roberts ' part is to devastate that country and force it to both come to he US for emergency aid as well as stop , which is the real reason of Roberts plan , from nationalizing it's oil wells ! An act that in effect would put the international oil companies , that Roberts is working for , out of business ! Not as far fetched as you would think since manipulating the weather is a fool proof method of causing havoc on a nations population and military establishment without , being that it's an Act of God , those doing it being blamed for it ! And thus rule out military retaliation by the targeted country . It's when both Dr . Young and Platt get wind , no pun intended , of Gen . Roberts insane plan of wiping out an entire Mexican town with it's thousands of inhabitants that they go into action in bringing his mad dream of both controlling the weather and thus the world to an end .

Platt in refusing to both intensify and then guide , with the electro magnetic generator , the Pacific typhoon to make landfall is murdered , or orders of Gen , Roberts , by his co-pilot before he could guide the storm back to sea . SPOILERS It's now up to Dr . Young who at the time is under arrest , in him being set up by Roberts in a hit and run accident , to both finish the job that the ill fated Dr . Platt started ! With the now rampaging killer storm , with the out of control electro magnetic generator guiding it , heading straight for Los angles it's up to Dr . Young to keep it from making landfall and wiping the city off the map . It's also in Gen Roberts best interest to get Dr . Young freed to do the job or else he'll have to answer for the deaths of thousands of American citizens . What Roberts is also planning is to disappeared , or have murdered , Dr . Young after he completed his mission ! Better then you would expect since we've been hit by a number of 3 4 and 5 category hurricanes , like depicted in the movie , over the last few years since the film " Storm Tracker " was released . Like were told in the movie , by non other then the deranged Gen . Roberts , that the weather can be the most effective weapon of mass destruction in history . In that its both impersonal and deathly effective at the same time . It was the very ironic fact that Gen .

Young , that had him offed by the very people that he was working for !
568594	2721657	97928	6.0	Pre " Silence of the Lambs " like serial murder thriller set In Toronto Canada	SPOILERS When the slashed body of Debbie Jones is found floating in Toronto Bay bells go off in the head of Toronto policeman John Reed when a note is found in Debbie's clothes implicating John Barens in her murder . It seems that Reed is infatuated with Barnes in having him arrested in a number of murders of young women where he was eventually found innocent . Arrested and jailed Barnes refuses to have a court-appointed lawyer or cooperate with police psychiatrist Dr . Rimbaue in what , if anything , he had to do with Debbies murder . With no evidence at all to hold Barnes he opts to stay behind bars instead of being let free which has you wonder what exactly he's hiding from the police in not only Debbie Jones murder but the murders that are soon to hit the city with a religious-like vengeance . Murders that he predicts in advance but at the same time is , by being behind bars , not out on the streets to commit ! We get a glimpse of what's behind this string of murders , as many as two dozen , as soon as the movie started with a flashback to 1979 in the little college town of Clemmends . It's not until the very last few seconds that we come to realize who set off this ten year rampage that had some unknown religious psycho go on . The movie is a lot like " Silance of the Lambs " that was in fact released a year later but nowhere as popular or well received . The film " Murder Blues " was almost totally ignored , by both movie critics and the movie the going public , in that it was kept of the self for almost two years until it was finally released not in the theaters but directly on video tape . " Murder Blues " despite it's low budget and zero publicity is in a way better then the Anthony Hopkins / Jodie Foster blockbuster . The killer in the film doesn't have any superhuman strength or omnipresence intelligence like Hannibal Lector in " Silance of the Lambs " . He also makes mistakes , proving that he's only human , which in the end , unlike with Lector , eventually does him in . We never really get to see what's the reason behind these murders until a mysterious book is discovered in of all places a bank safe deposit box that belonged to the late Debbie Jones . SPOILER ALERT The occult-like book titled " The Church of the New Soul " links all the killings going on in Toronto now in 1990 to the one unsolved murder that took place in Clemmends back in 1979 ! What's far more disturbing is that Toronto cop John Reed who's the chief investigator of the " Toronto Serial Killer " case knows a lot more about it , and the killer himself , then he's leading us , the audience , on to what he knows !
568287	2721657	83296	6.0	12 Noon to 8 PM	SPOILERS One of the many slasher movies released in the early 1980's following the amazing success of " Halloween " the Canadian import film " Visiting Hours " has the distinction of both the killer and his victims not being in their teens or early twenties and partying day and night but grown ups holding down full time jobs . The psycho / killer in " Visiting Hours " has been troubled over what happened to his father when he was a little boy , which we see in a number of flashbacks that left the old man almost brain-dead and in a vegetated state . Working at his job as a janitor at the America Today studio Colt Hawker , Michael Ironside , gets infuriated over the shows host Deborah or Deb Ballin , Lee Grant , support of a woman who in self-defense crippled her abusive husband by pushing him down a flight of stairs . This reminds Colt of what happened to his father when his mom splashed a pan of boiling oil in his face as he was abusing her . The rest of the movie has Colt going after Deb with a vengeance and murdering some half dozen other persons , who got in his way , in the process . After slashing Deb in her home Colt spends almost the entire movie stalking her at the local hospital where she was admitted at . Even taking time to pick up a date Lisa , Lenore Zann , at a diner who he almost kills . The ending is more or less what you would have expected with a major role change between the hunted an the hunter as Deb turns the tables on Colt as she's being stalked by him in an almost empty hospital . The movie ends with a long long list of credits of the people in the movie , on and off the screen , about the size of the Montreal White Pages . Better then you would expect slasher film only because of Michael Ironside's creepy performance as Colt Hawker who comes across as someone who just doesn't give up . As he goes as far as slashing his left arm on a broken beer bottle in order to get himself admitted into the same hospital where Deb is staying at just so that he can get to her ; it just turned out that Deb got to him first . P . S . There's also William Shatner in the movie paying Deb's boss Gary Baylor who , despite his top billing , has about two minutes of screen time in the entire film .

It turns out that Baron Latos , John Carradine , has a problem with being exposed to the sunlight , he's a vampire . The Baron is actually Count Dracula , with a British accent , who's sick and tired of having to go out at night looking for victims to suck dry for their blood in order to keep him going and in the pink . Dr . Edelman doing what he can to help the Count is unaware that he's really after his sexy assistant the beautiful Miliza Morrelle , Martha O'Driscoll , in trying to turn her into a vampire like himself . Also on Dr . Edelman's mind his his sweet and pretty but deformed hunchback nurse Nina , Jane Adams , who like himself works tirelessly to help those who can't help themselves in the doctor's medical experiments . One of those helpless souls Larry Talbot , Lon Cheney Jr , turns up at the castle but because of Dr . Edelman's heavy schedule he's told to come back later . This rejection by Dr . Edelman had Larry go crazy at the local police station . With Larry begging the police chief Insp . Holtz , Lionel Attwil , to lock him up in the clink before he kills somebody . Dr . Edelman showing up at the jail-house at the invitation of a very concerned Inspt . Holtz is shocked to see Larry turn into a wild beast , a werewolf , at the sight of the full moon . Taking Larry under is wing Dr . Edelman finds out that he has a very overactive cranium that cause these seizures that turns him into a wolf-man . The cure , a fungus that he's growing in his greenhouse , to Larrys very pressing problems will not be ready until at least a month after which Larry will have to face a number of full moons and turn into a werewolf .

All the lead characters in the movie are now in place , Dracula the Wolf-man and Frankenstein Monster , for the big and explosive final that will turn the Edelman castle into a monster free for all . Sill there will be one added attraction in this wild and crazy mix : Dr . Edelman ! The doctor is himself turned into a monster by the schemings and evil Baron Latos , aka Count Dracula . The count did that by giving the doctor instead of taking from him a paint of his vampire blood during a mutual blood transfusion . In putting all the Universal Studio famous monsters into one movie took something away from it by spreading them too thin and not giving the monsters enough screen time to really scare you . Larry , Lon Cheney Jr , had the most meaty role of all the monsters as the famous Wolf-Man but he was cured almost as soon as he showed his canine teeth . Larry ended up spending the rest of the movie mostly in a wheel chair , recovering from his successful operation , looking and acting more like a 1960's hippie peace-nick then the wild and ferocious werwolf's the you expected him to be in the film . The big final also has the namesake of the movie Count Dracula conspicuously absent from it only having the Frankenstein Monster and Larry Talbot , who's normal and not a werewolf , having it out with each other . With the big bumbling Monster blindly and uncontrollably walking into the walls furniture and test tubes in and around the castle . Dr . Edelman by now a crazed psycho , because of the vampire blood in his system , ends up murdering both Seigfried , Ludwig Stossel , the friendly coach driver and his nurse Nina whom he promised to cure of her hunchback , before he went nuts . Dr . Edelman is then put away for good by Larry Talbot who reluctantly blasts him full of holes with his handgun ; this to a man who saved Larry's soul by in the end losing his own .

Right away old wounds are opened up as we see how the people in town respond to Chuck with total disdain and disgust blaming him for the murder , that was declared an accident , of his first wife Mary , Cyntyhina Preston some twenty years ago . At the reading of the will it's discovered that Rev . Leo left Chuck $10 , 000 . 00 together with another ten grand to his housekeeper Mrs . Ford , Katherine Helmound , who didn't bother to show up . But the over $250 , 000 . 00 that was given to him by Pete Gromek , Brandon Maggart , together with Art Sannar & Clift Bartok , Daniel Quinne & Jack McGee , to invest was completely gone due to , from what Leo said in his will , bad investments . A number of story lines run concurrently in the film " Living in Fear " with the suspicion of Chuck being his first wife's murderer leading the pack . Chuck is also discovered to have been institutionalized , for a nerves condition , while in the US Marines during the Vietnam War . a fact that he withheld from his wife Rebecca . That as well as being somehow involved in the later deaths of housekeeper Mrs Ford and his former high school sweetheart Jeanine , Michele Scarabelli . Jeanine was not only suffering from a very severe case of wife abuse but who was also blackmailing Chuck with information that she knew about Mary's death and who's body was later found in the trunk of Chuck's car . The most shocking thing that comes out of Chuck's past has in fact something to do with the death of his first wife Mary that was no accident but a crime of passion , as everyone in town had long suspected . But the passion of the person who killed her and why had nothing to do with Chuck at all , even though he helped cover up the crime . This we discover was the real reason for Chuck's mental breakdown and instability that has haunted him all these twenty years .

Then incites Jeannie somewhat mad dog husband Stuart , Ted Haler , on him in order to have Chuck murdered in a fit of uncontrollable passion on his part . This effort in getting the lost money on the killers part was a bit confusing since why take the chance of having Chuck killed before he can find out where the hidden cash was that Chuck later , with the help of an old photo of him when he was 12 , found ? We also learn the person responsible for Jeanine death also had it in for Chuck ever since he married Mary some twenty years ago . Since he was her boyfriend at the time and felt that Chuck stole her from him .

SPOILERS Trying to get to Provincetown MA . for a play that she's staring in the famous and temperamental actress Laura Winters , Rita Morley , who's stranded in NYC , some 300 miles away , gets herself so smashed on gin that she'll have trouble remembering her name much less her lines . This has her very concerned agent Jan Letterman , Barbara Wilkin , get a charted plane to fly Laura there for opening night as a major storm approaches the New England coast . Down and out shuttle pilot Grant Murdoc , Byron Sanders , who at first balks at flying through the dangerous cloud-cover changes his mind when Jan offers him three times the amount of cash that he usually takes for the flight . Airborne and on a due north course to Cape Cod with the storm overtaking his plane Murdoc is forced to land on this uncharted and , what at first looks like , deserted island in Long Island Sound . Murdoc together with Jan and the barley sober Laura are surprised to find this creepy-looking guy who claims to be a professor in marine biology Peter Bartell played Joseph Gobbels look-alike Martin Kosleck . Acting normal , which is a herculean task for him , not to get his guests on the island suspicious to his real intentions Bertell is well on his way of perfecting this radio active and flesh eating algae or plankton . Who's formula he's planing to sell to the highest bidder , the US the USSR the UK and even Germany East or West . With which it , the country that Bertell sells it to , can not only conquer the waves but the world as well . Things get a little muddled for Bertell when he loses himself in a fit of carnal and uncontrollable lust when he finds Laura sunning herself on the beach all by herself . Bartell tries to rape the drunken , but very well endowed , Laura who fights off the horny old guy . Laura had already gotten herself so drunk that the next day she completely forgot what happened to her . Which gives the hot in the pants Bertell a second chance at her which he does later in the film . It's later that when this spaced out beatnik Omar , Ray Tudor , shows up on his raft that things really start to get out of hand . Omar together with Laura later discover what Bartell is doing which cost them both their lives . I turned out that the professor himself is , more then anyone in the movie , responsible for his own demise by thinking that he can fool with the laws of nature and get away with it . Bartell's mad experiments with the man-eating plankton which , after he electrifies it , turns into a glowing and flesh-eating crab-like monster . A monster which there's no way of him controlling or stopping from swallowing all life , human as well as fish and animal , on earth . Really a Martin Kosleck movie with everyone else in the film , with the possible exception or the drugged out and mind addled beatnik Omar , just there going through the motions and nothing else . Kosleck or the person he's playing Proffesor Peter Bartell gives it all he's got as the crazed , in the flashbacks we don't really know for sure if he was or wasn't , ex-Nazi mad scientist who like his deceased and beloved Fuhrer wants to take over the world . In Bartell's case for a nice and tidy profit not to , like in German Fuhrer Adolph Hitler's case , National Socialize or Nazify it . Like all movie about mad scientists Bartell screws himself up big time by him trying to create an army of killer and flesh-eating micro organisms he instead creates , by electrifying the waters off shore , a giant illuminating crab . The glowing crab has the crazed Bartell run for his life only to get attacked by flesh-eaters who make short order of him by turning Bartell into a bag of bones . Murdoc who found out , through Laura's strange death , what can stop this crab-like creature and with a syringe of anti-flesh-eating serum , plain human blood , sticks it to it and puts an end to this insanity . An insanity of gigantic proportions that only a fruitcake , with lots of nuts in it , like Professor Peter Bartell could have dreamed up .
567954	2721657	27428	6.0	The Black Cat is actually Gray and White !	SPOILERS Not at all the Perry Mason of Raymond Burr TV fame Perry is played by the witty eloquently sophisticated and most of all , unlike Mr . Burr , thin Ricardo Cortez . Perry get's involved in a case defending murder suspect Douglas Keene , Carlyle Moore Jr , at the assistance of his fiancé Wilma Lexter , Jane Bryan ; Wilma is the grand-daughter of Peter Laxter , Harry Davenport , one of the three persons who ended up as murder victims in the movie . Perry also becomes the attorney of record of this screeching and annoying cat named Clicker who's owner Laxter's caretaker Ashton , George Rosner , is worried that one of his employers relatives will kill Clicker just to shut him up so that he can finally get some sleep . There's far more to the movie then Clicker but it's the crazy cat who unwitting set's off a series of events that lead to two murders and the abduction of the body of hobo Watson Clammert . Clammert is to be used as a substitute for the load mouth and grouchy Peter Lexter who got wind that one of his many close , to his money , relatives were planning to kill him knowing that he'll change his will leaving everything over to the cat . Having Perry come over to re-write his will later that evening at the Lexter Mansion it suddenly burns down with a body burned beyond recognition found in the rubble . Later Perry finds out that the day before the fire Lexter had converted all his stocks and bonds into cash , a cool million dollars , that mysteriously disappeared . Asking the police coroner to exhume Lexter's body to see if in fact he did die in the fire it's found out that he was actually dead hours before and that the fire was just a cover . It later turned out that the persons who set the Lexter Mansion on fire had no idea that not only was whoever they thought was Lexter was already dead . Lexter himself planned his own murder , by them , in order t catch his killers flat-footed in the act of trying to murder him . What makes the movie really work is that the last ten minutes or so we get a flashback of what really happened . The flashback connects not only old man Peter Lexter but his nurse Louise DeVoe , Nedda Harrigan , and caretaker and owner of Clicker the Cat , Ashton , to the killing . The ten minute on flashback helped explain a lot of the very complicated plot , through Perry's courtroom monologue , that tied all the lose ends together and made an almost impossible to follow murder mystery easily understood . Laxter played his cards right by tricking those who were just about to do him in to expose themselves . It was their greed in not only wanting to grab Lexter's missing million but getting their hands the valuable Koltsdorf Diamond necklace that Laxter together with his caretaker Ashton secretly hid . It turned out that it was Clicker , or one of his feline relatives , who by his wild and crazy antics provided the clue that not only broke the murder case wide open by in effect marking the killer , thus making it easy to identify , by Perry Mason , him .
568494	2721657	46186	6.0	This guy's walking around in in a monkey suit killing people !	( Some Spoilers ) Early 1950's man from space movie where in this case , it's the spaceman thats in trouble not the earthmen and women . A UFO is tracked from Point Barrow Alaska entering the earth's atmosphere traveling at some 5 , 000 MPH as it heads south some 3 , 000 miles down the Pacific coast it loses speed and crashes in the ocean off Santa Monica Calif . The local police are alerted when all the electricity around Santa Monica gets blacked-out and a number of people are found dead ; one on the beach and another , a night watchman , outside an oil field that was set on fire . It turns out that the person responsible for all this is the spaceman , who ejected from the spacecraft before it crashed , and only killed in self-defense when he thought that he was being threatened by the people in the area . A local man-hunt is on to find the killer who sheds his space outfit and turns out to be invisible but he also finds it difficult to breath the air in the earth's atmosphere . The spaceman has to get back to the local observatory where his suit and helmet are to put on in order to stay alive . Slowing suffocating the alien tries to make contact with the earthmen , with some kind of Morse Code , but to no avail . With the scientists and police trying to make contact and show the spaceman that they mean no harm a local reporter takes a photo of the alien which has it drop it's life saving helmet , due to the camera flash that excited it , and it breaks . With that the last hope to stay alive for the spaceman is gone and as he runs up to the top of the observatory , chased by the earthmen , he starts to become visible as he slowly loses his ability to breath and dies . Even though the special effects in the movie " Phatom from Space " are of the bargain basement variety the very interesting and imaginative story more then makes up for them . We see in the film that it's the alien thats the victim of the earth's environment not the earthlings being threatened by the alien's advance technology . The space alien didn't want to do the people of earth any harm , all he wanted to do was get back home to his planet , but it was the earth's atmosphere like in the movie " War of the Worlds " that in the end killed him .
568761	2721657	81563	6.0	Canadian Police Drama	Contains Spoiler ! ! ! Just to see Paul Williams , Julius Kurtz , playing a big time city pimp should make " Stone Cold Dead " worth watching . With the always reliable Richard Crenna , Sgt . Boyd as the Toronto cop with an obsession for putting Kurtz away and off the streets to make the city safe . Some deranged sniper has been offing prostitutes and at the same time photographing them and sending the photos to the police to taunt them and make them feel helpless in catching him . Sgt . Boyd thinks that it's Kurtz that's the killer and is out to get the goods on him . You would wonder why Kurtz would kill his own employees and hurt his prostitution business ? Does Boyd know something ? Fairly good whodunit with a surprising performance on the part of Paul Williams as the cool pimp with a heart of gold when it comes to taking good care of his " ladies " even though he can be rough some times but as everyone watching the movie knows Julie doesn't really mean it . A very effective and sympathetic scene in the film is when Kurtz is at a funeral of one of his murdered " ladies " and Sgt . Boyd arrives uninvited hassling him . Kurtz then quietly tell him " Can't you see that I'm here to pay my respects " . It just made me wonder who was the good guy and who was the bad guy in the movie . Sgt . Boyd gets really involved in the murder case when one of the hookers murdered by the sniper turns out to be a woman undercover detective who's also a good friend of his and it all becomes very personal with him . The ending of the movie is made to shock and surprise and it does very convincingly with the audience not seeing it coming . " Stone Cold Dead " has that rough and gritty look to it more because of it's small budget then it's filmmakers artistic talents in movie realism with better then average acting from it's supporting cast of Linda Sorenson , Monica Page , and Alberta Watson , Olivia Page , then you would usually see in a B-Movie .
568701	2721657	34428	6.0	He Stinks !	( Some Spoilers ) What seems like a hastily made Hollywood propaganda movie about the Japaneses entrance into WWII against the USA , via the attack on Pearl Harbor . If you noticed the time sequence there was no war between the US and Japan but only the war between Rick Leland , Humphrey Bogart , and a gang of Japanese spies and houseboys , who were really Japanese soldiers in disguise , with the attack on Pearl Harbor never even mentioned . In fact the movie seems to have ended in the early morning hours of December 7 , 1941 Panama time something like eight hours before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor actually happened . Capt . Richard " Rick " Leland is drummed out of the US Army at the beginning of the film " Across the Pacific " for larceny and after being rejected in joining the Canadean military . Rick takes a Japanese freighter , the Gena Mara , to the US controlled Panama Canal Zone where he just happened to have been stationed at for four years . It doesn't take much to figure out that Rick is actually a spy for the USA using his current situation , of being a disgruntled ex-US Army officer , in the US military to throw off the sneaky Jap's into thinking he's ready to sell out his country that he served all these years . It's when the Genoa Maru docks at New York Harbor that we get the lowdown to Rick's real objective but it was very obvious to us well before that . What's really a mystery in " Across the Pacific " is just who passenger Alberta Marlow , Mary Astor , is working with , if anyone at all , on the boat the US or the Japanese ? The big guy who's a fanatical supporter of the Japanese and their plans for expansion in the Pacafic is non other then the " Fat Man " himself Dr . Lorenz , Sydney Geenstreet . Rick having saved Dr . Lorenz from being killed by a Filipino assassin got the doc to become very friendly with him and let him in on what he , and his Japanese cohorts , are planing ; to bomb and bottle up the Panama Canal Zone thus keeping the US Atlantic Fleet from reinforcing the Pacific Fleet in the event of a war between America and Japan . Rick goes from a spy to an action hero in the end of the film by shooting it out with the Jap's and preventing the Japanese torpedo plane , that was secretly assembled in Panama by the undercover Japanese houseboys . This is all done by Rick in order to prevent the Japanese from bombing the locks in the Panama Canal . To Rick's surprise , and relief , Alberta had nothing to do with the Japanese saboteurs and it turned that her dad the dead drunk Dan Morton ( Monte Blue ) , who the Jap's were using his plantation to get their personnel into Panama . Dan wired Alberta to come to his aid since he was sinking , in a bottle of rum , fast and no longer able to run his place effectively . Besides Dr . Lorenz one of the top Jap spies was a two generation Japanese-America the well-spoken , in English , and collegiate looking Joe Tolsuiiko , Sen Young , which by watching the movie now gives you the impression that there were many Japanese-Americans living in the US involved in spying on the US and working for their " fatherland " against their adopted county which was anything but the truth . It seemed that all the action in the movie was going on when both Japan and the United States were technically at peace , before Sunday 7AM December 7 , 1941 Hawaii time . All this made the film a bit odd by realizing that the war-like action was happening before the first Japanese bombs , and torpedoes , struck the Pacific Fleet docked at Pearl Harbor .
568591	2721657	51887	6.0	The title character upon which this story is based on is true .	( Some Spoilers ) Early Roger Corman AIP collaboration that comes across pretty good with a cool jazzy score by Gerald Fried . We find out right away that this killer of a gangster George " Machine Gun " Kelly , Charles Bronson , is anything but a killer when he freezes at the sight of a bouquet of flowers at a local Lebanon funeral home . This happens at the start of the movie when Kelly and his gang are about to knock off a bank . Ripping off $41 , 000 . 00 in the bank robbery the gangs pick-up man Mike " Fanny " Fandango , Morey Amsterdam , takes $6 , 000 . 00 for himself before Kelly and his gang have time to split up the take . Outraged at Fanny's two-timing Kelly later , after working him over , has Fanny served up for lunch to a caged mountain lion who ends up ripping off his left arm . It's this act of unnecessary violence that in the end , according to the movie , has Fanny turn against Kelly which leads to his retirement as a big time gangster . Kelly ends up spending the remainder of his life in federal prisons like Alcatraz and Leavenworh dying behind bars on July 18 , 1954 which just happened to be Kelly's 59th birthday . Kelly is depicted , very accurately like he was in real life , in the movie " Machine Gun Kelly " as a cowardly bully who pushed people around only when the odds , and guns , were all in his favor . It's later in the movie during another attempted robbery in the small Oklahoma town of Elizabeth Kelly once more screws up . Kelly panicked when he sees a coffin being delivered to a funeral home , they always seem to pop up at the wrong time for Kelly in the movie , which in the series of events that follows cause his wheel-man Maize , Wally Campo , to end up getting shot to death after a wild car chase . Howard , Jack Lambert , who was in the bank when Kelly , who was to help him rob it , chickened out escaped . Later Howard and his gang ended up being massacred by a pumped up Kelly who ambushed them playing poker at their hideout . It took Kelly's gun moll Flo Becker , Susan Cabot , to get the wimpy hoodlum to get his courage back by taunting him in what a gutless coward he really was . Hiding out from the police at Flo's mom's Ma ' Becker , Connie Gilchrist , home Kelly dreams up a new scheme in making big bucks without the dangers of robbing banks ; kidnapping . This new criminal adventure on Kelly's part at first seemed to be paying dividends with Kelly & Flo grabbing little nine year old Sherry Vito , Lori Martin , as she and her nurse or nanny Lynn Gryson , Barboura Morris , were coming home from school . Contacting Sherry's dad Mr . Andrew Vito , Robert Griffin , Kelly wants $100 , 000 . 00 in cash from him as ransom if he ever wants to see his daughter again . As you would expect by now in the movie the not too bright Kelly screws up . Having again recruited the now one armed , because of Kellys actions , " Fanny " Fandango to be his pick-up man Fanny instead , in revenge to what Kelly did to him , snitches Kelly together with his partners in crime Flo and the equally one-armed Harry , Frank DeKova , out to the police ! Fanny also proved to be as brainless as his reality-challenged boss George Kelly by bragging , as the cops were closing in on Kelly's and Flo's hideout , that he sold him out ! Whatever happened to Fanny next , getting his brains blown out from behind , had nothing to do with Machine Gun Kelly who was too chicken to do anything with the cops and FBI men shooting up the place . A terrified Kelly ended up cowering in a corner and weeping like a little boy as the lawmen finally put the cuffs on him and took this poor excuse of a gangster . Unlike the legendary hoods of that time , Dillinger Pretty Boy Floyd and Bonnie and Clyde , George " Machine Gun " Kelly lived to eventually die in bed not in a blazing shootout with the local police or FBI Agents . Kelly's who life as a fearless gunslinging , with his tommy gun , gangster was all a myth made up by his gun moll and partner in crime Flo Becker . It's suspected that it was Flo , a member of the weaker sex , who really did most off the bank jobs that Kelly was credited with in the newspapers . This was done by Flo to build up her boyfriends image who in return smacked her around every chance he got . Even Kelly's working Flo over was sissy-like in him , not being a Jack Dempsey or Joe Louis , not being able to even make a mark on Flo , who took it all in stride , no matter how hard he belted her . P . S One thing that you have to give George " Machine Gun " Kelly credit for is in him coining the word , referring to FBI Agents , G-Men . It was that word , " Please don't shoot me I give up G-Men " , that a scared to death George Kelly uttered as he was about to be arrest and put away for good as the " G-Men " busted into his hideout .
568254	2721657	40829	6.0	He's such a Smooooth Operator	SPOILERS Eerie and hunting movie photographed in a Film-Noir black and white dream-like style that would be hard to duplicate even now with all the special effects available to todays film-makers . The film's about the spirit world and about one of it's inhabitants attempt to contact someone on the " other side " . Is this about rekindling a love long lost or is the whole story just an elaborate hoax . Concocted by an ex-con con man trying to bilk his unsuspecting victim out of her money ?

Telling Christine facts about her and Paul that only she knows and then like a puff of smoke he disappears into the evening mist with only his raven still there . All that Christine has of this mysterious stranger to prove that he was real and not a dream or hallucination was his business card : Alexis Spiritualist at Large . Christine was so taken by this man of mysteries that she went to his pad and got a reading that confirmed a lot of things about her and Paul that he , Alexis , had no why of knowing . Christine's younger sister Janet , Cathy O'Donnell , and fiancée Martin get in touch with a private detective who specializes in these types of frauds and was once a magician himself Det . Hoffman , Harry B . Mandoza , to check this chap out . It turned out that Alexis served a stretch in the pen for swindling an old lady out of a load of cash in Chicago , he was then known as The Great Mister Marue . Janet later goes to Alexis to get a reading from him as well as get his fingerprints on a cigarette case to prove that he's the ex-con Mr . Marue . Janet becomes so impressed by Alexis ' supernatural powers and his charm that she instead of trying to get him arrested for fraud falls head over heels in love with him . Is this Alexis just a smooth con man trying to get all he can out of Christine's bank account and flee the coup like he did back in Chicago only to get nabbed by the police or is he , is he , the Real McCoy ? Captivating little movie that in the last twenty minutes or so turns from a more or less harmless fantasy about life after death into a dangerous murder / drama with death a very real possibility for everyone involved . A fine cast headed by the suave and mysterious Turhan Bey as Alexis The Magnificent who can charm the dress or panties off any woman or girl in the movie either alive or dead .
568373	2721657	78144	7.0	Despite Buford Pussers untimely death his legend lives on	( Slight Spoilers ) Somewhat fictional account of the life and times of Sheriff Buford Pusser , convincingly played by Brian Dennehy . The film " A Real American Hero " Brings out both the courage combativeness as well as the sensitivity of the late and legendary sheriff of Tennessee's's McNairy County and what he was faced with both the bad guys and the law , that in most cases protected them in , fighting crime . Keeping the violence in check we get to see Buford's attempt to stamp out crime in McNairy County but soon realizing that when you take the law into your own hands you end up , instead of enforcing , breaking it . Sheriff Pusser is incensed at the deaths of two local teenage boys and the blinding of their two girlfriends , whom he caught speeding . Finding out that they were served bootleg whiskey , or rat gut hooch , at the nearby Danny's Disco . Buford goes there not for a drink or to dance but to takes the place apart . Hauled into court like a common criminal for a number of violations of the law , like destroying private property , Buford promises the judge that he'll be a good boy from now on . Going the letter of the law Buford attempts to get Danny Boy Mitchell , Ken Howard , the owner of Danny's Disco and top hood in McNairy County and put him behind bars by doing it . Danny Boy who at first felt safe from Sheriff Pusser with the law and courts being on his side soon becomes a paranoid nut-case as his enterprise , of bootlegging and being a night club disco entrepreneur , was in danger of going bankrupt . With Pusser finding the most obscure laws on the books , some over 100 years old , to fine Danny Boy he's in danger of being put him out of business . Getting desperate Danny has his hoods try to run and gun down Buford and his two kids only to get him really pied off at them and work twice as hard , in finding violations on Danny Boy's business ventures , to put Danny not only out of business but behind bars . Which leads in Danny now really losing it , after Buford worked him over in a " friendly " boxing match , and has his hoods set sheriff Pusser up for the kill , with the help of his girlfriend who works in Buford's office . This action his his part in the end spells curtains for Danny Boy not Sheriff Pusser . Nowhere as violent and brutal as the previous two " Walking Tall " or " Buford Pusser " movies but more interesting though according to the movies epilogue the story is fiction . Actor Brian Dennehy heroic as well as sensitive portrayal of the legendary sheriff made him far more human , and not being a mindless and unstoppable one man wrecking crew . Besides being a loving father and husband Buford also goes out of his way in a side plot that had really nothing to do with the movie to help beautiful ex-convict Carrie Todd played by Sherre North . With the self-righteous and stuffed up women of McNairy County wanting to run Carrie out of town Bufrord invited her to go the big dance , with him of course , in order to stick it to the overlay concerned women in town . Carrie herself won over their respect by saving the life of Eunis ' , the head of the righteous squad , daughters life when she was chocking on a chicken bone using the Heinrick maneuver . You see Carrie studied being a nurse while spending time behind bars . P . S The theme song in the movie " A True American Hero " aptly titled " Walking Tall " was sung by Don Williams .

Willi born into the cream of Vienna society rose in the rank of the elite Royal Imperial Guard to the point where he became a member of it's officer corps . Always having friends and relatives in high places to clean up after him after he royally screwed things up Willi has no idea of what being responsible was . With Willi's uncle Gen . Von Hertz , C . Aubrey Smith , in charge of the military base that he's stationed at he knew that whatever boners he pulled good old Uncle Hertz would take care of them . One thing Willi didn't expect to happen was to fall in love with someone else , besides himself , and accept the responsibility that goes alone with that . At a party with his officer friends at the Vienna night-spot " Madam Saguss " Willi spots this sweet and lovely young lady Laura Taub , Helen Chandler , who's a music teacher . Later Willi sees Laura going upstairs to a room with big spender and notorious whore-mister Herr Schnabel , Jean Hersholt . Suspecting that Schnabel was up to no good Willi goes to see if everything is all right only to hear Laura screaming inside the hotel-room as she fights off Schnabel from trying to force himself on her . Willi puts an end to Herr Schnabel's advances by punching him out . Taking the grateful Laura , who at first didn't trust him , on a night on the town Willi spends the next morning at her apartment having breakfast .

Helen , who fell in love with Willi , by seeing the note after Willi left now feels insulted by what he did in treating her as if she were just a one night stand to him or even worse . With Helen letting Willi have it when he came to see her the next day , about what he did to her , left him both hurt and humiliated since he also fell in love with Helen . Willi's action , by leaving the money , was nothing more that a show of appreciation not a fee for her spending the night with him , which didn't include anything more serious then two or three harmless smooches and getting her a bit tipsy on a couple of glasses of French wine . Helen goes over the deep end by going back to the sleazy Herr Schnabel and becoming the kind of person that she thinks that Willi thought that she was with her drinking gambling and whoring around . Guilt-ridden by what he did to Helen in turning her into a party animal-type , from the sweet and innocent girl that she was , Willi tries to win her back from Schnabel . Challenging to go head to head with Schnabel in a no holds-bar game of Baccarat Willi feels that would win Helen back to him .

Von Hertz for the money and facing disgrace as a member of the Royal Imperial Guard Willi has only one option left open to him : a bullet to the head from his own service revolver . Decent ending that doesn't at all cop-out like you would have thought that it would with Willi redeeming himself and getting back , as well as saving her from a life of sin , the women that he loved Helen . Coming to grips with the real world Willi threw away his playboy lifestyle that he lived all his adult life . Like Willi said when he came to see Helen at the end of the film when asked , by the parents of a young boy that Helen was teaching to play the piano , why he didn't have his army uniform on he answered this way : Were both going to a masquerade and I'm going as a human being .

568189	2721657	32258	7.0	Coals to Newcastle	SPOILERS On his way to the electric chair to pay the ultimate price for the shooting death of Newcastle University's popular and beloved English Professor George Kingsley , Stanley Ridges , Newcastle brain surgeon . Dr . Ernest Sovac , Boris Karloff , hands over his personal diary to reporter James Craig . Craig is one of the 12 witnesses at his execution . This was done by Dr . Sovac's for the fair and honest reporting that Craig did on his sensational murder trial so that he can get the scoop on what really happened that led to the tragic death of Pro . Kingsley . Craig had been very even-handed in his reporting and Dr . Sovac wanted him to have the real story that led to Prof . Kingsley's tragic death and to his , Dr . Sovac , upcoming execution . The whole story started some time back on a Friday , Friday the 13th , the last day of classes at Newcastle U . where Prof . Kingsley was to go on his way to New York for a interview to get a teaching job a at top Ivy League college . This bunch of hoodlums from New York City came speeding through town and shooting at each others and then ran down poor Prof . Kingsley leaving him brain dead and one of the hoods Red Cannon near death . In an effort to save his good friend George Kingsley Dr . Sovac had the brain of the dying gangster Red Cannon transplanted into the skull of the comatose Prof . Kingsley in order to save his life . Dr . Sovac later started to get ideas when he heard that Cannon had hidden some $500 , 000 . 00 back in NYC and with that tried to have the recovering Prof . Kingsley take a trip with him to the Big Apple in order to recover the money . Dr . Sovac wanted to use stolen money in advancing the cause of brain-transportation that he needed to continue his research . Taking Kingsley to Cannon's old hunts at the Midtown Hotel in NYC as well as at the Club Royal where Cannon's girlfriend singer Sunny Rogers , Anne Negel , is the top act there so that these familiar settings would reactivate the dead gangsters memory . Kingsley is induced to be Red Cannon by Dr . Sovac planting memories into his mind about Cannon's activities . this all leads Cannon's brain to take over Kingsley's body and use the fact that he's been dead and buried , as the notorious gangster Red Cannon , to go out as the meek and kind prof . Kingsley and murder those who double crossed and killed him . Taking out in short order fellow gang-members Devore Kane & Miller , Raymond Bailey Paul Fix & Edmund MacDonald , the only one left for Cannon to finish off is Eric Marnay , Bela Lugosi , who took over his place as the head of the former Red Cannon Gang . Going to Marney's apartment at the Ritz Manor Cannon is confronted by two detectives who came to see him , Marney , and after faking that he's Prof . Kingsgley murders them . Finding out that Marney grabbed the hidden $500 , 000 . 00 when he was too busy murdering both Miller Kingsley / Cannon later tracks down Marley at Sunny's pad where Marley together with Cannon's two-timing girlfriend , Sunny Rogers , planned to take-off with the loot and leave the city . Murdering Sunny and killing Marley , by locking him in a closet where he was hiding and have him suffocated to death , Cannon comes back to the Midtown Hotel with the cash . While he's asleep and out cold Dr . Sovac gets him to forget who he is and gets him to believe that he's now Prof .

Back at Newcastle , as an English professor , the buried memories that are hidden in Prof . Kingsley's mind come to the surface when he hears a police siren . The mind-splitting siren activates Prof . Kingley's mind and turns him into the killer Red Cannon . Breaking into Dr . Sovac house to find the $500 , 000 . 00 that he took from him and then trying to murder his daughter Anne , Anne Gwynne , Sovac shoots Prof . Kingsley dead . Dr . Sovac kept this truth from the public while he was still alive about his killing of Prof . Kingsley to save his , Kingsley's , family any more suffering and paid for it with his life . Even though Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi are the two top stars in the movie it's really Stanley Ridge that's the star of the film " Black Friday " . Ridge's double-performance as the meek collage professor Kingsley and at the same time the ruthless killer Red Cannon is one of the best acting jobs on film that I've ever seen . Karloff and Lugosi are never seen even in the same frame much less together in the entire movie .
568385	2721657	50356	7.0	Be a good warrior and never think Heinie , you pay a penalty for thinking	SPOILERS Even though the German U-Boat crew are the enemy in the movie " The Enemy Below " it's hard to dislike them . Since they together with their courageous and understanding , for the Americans as well as his own German sailors , Capt . Von Stolberg , Curt Jurgens , are anything but villains in the film . About the only negative person that I could find in the entire movie is the gong-ho German sailor Kunz , Arthur La Ral , who's a bit too much of a company man , to the annoyance of of the very down to earth Capt . Von Stolberg . With his Prussian-like attitude toward rules and authority and in one scene in the movie Kunz is even seen reading Hitler's " Mein Kampf " but that's about as " bad " as Kunz's gets . Out on he high seas of the South Atlantic the US destroyer-escort Haines runs into a German sub , through it's radar-detection , that is on it's way for a rendezvous with the German Raider M battle cruiser . After that the sub is to sail for home to a U-Boat port in German occupied France . The escort-destroyer USS Hines Captain Murrell , Robert Mitchum , knowing that the U-Boat is not interested in any combat with his war-ship tricks Capt . Von Stolberg into attacking him by making his destroyer a very inviting target , practically getting right in middle of the periscope sights of Von Stolberg submarine . Von Stolberg by exposing his position in attacking the Hines , and missing it with two well placed torpedo's , has the rest of the movie turned into a deadly cat and mouse game between Murrell's destroyer and Von Stolberg's U-boat . That in the end causes both to go under the waves with the two captains gaining enormous respect for each other for their courageous skills . Most of all the chivalry that they displayed in their one on one battle at sea . Like in a boxing match with the two opponents feeling each other out to find an opening , for a right-cross or left-hook , Von Stolberg senses that when the Hines goes into attack-mode it suddenly turns and goes on the same parallel course , for about 500 yards , to his U-boat . Making it a sitting duck for a torpedo attack where he doesn't even have to surface , to periscope depth , but just let go of his torpedo's without even having to look to hit his target . Capt . Murrell falling right into Capt . Von Stolberg's trap form a direct torpedo hit does what he can to evacuate his crew and almost singled-handedly steers the sinking USS Haines right into the disabled , from getting hit by Capt .

568516	2721657	289879	7.0	The Scream of the Butterfly	SPOILERS The movie " Butterfly Effect " starts off like a deep psychological drama and then slowly turns into and finally in the last half of the film becomes a Sci-Fi adventure about time travel . Young Evan Treborn , Ashton Kutcher , has been suffering severe black-outs all his life , a condition that put his father Jason , Callum Keith , in a mental institution . Being examined at the hospital for his black-outs the doctor suggests that Evan keep a journal , which is central to the story , about what happened every day to him in order to jog back his memory . As Edan grows up and leaves for college the black-outs stop and for once in his life Edan becomes normal like everyone else . Involved in a college project about memory retention Evan dusts off his journals that he hasn't read for years and when he does read them the black-outs of his childhood begin to be filled in . Excited over this discovery Edan goes to see a childhood friend Larry , Elden Henson , who he hasn't seen for years to confirm if his new memories of the past are true or just imagined . To Edan's surprise from what he gets from Larry his visions are true but Larry unlike Edan wants to forgets about them . Edan's bringing them up depresses Larry so much that his mother tells Edan never to see or call Larry again . Edan then goes back to the town where he lived as a little boy to see Kayley , Amy Smart , who is at first glad to see him but when Edan brings up the story about her and himself being forced to have sex and being taped by her sick and pedophile father George , Eric Stoltz , she becomes very upset . It may be new to Evan but Kayley had been trying to put that terrible event out of her mind for years and didn't want it brought up again . Still Edan is so obsessed about what Kayley's father did to her and himself that he doesn't notice or realize how it's hurting Kayley and later he finds out from her outraged brother Tommy , Willie Lee Scott , that Kayley killed herself . After that movie turns from a drama about remembering past events to going back in time to change them . It's never fully explained , all Edan does is just look dates in his journal , just how but Edan somehow manages to go back in time and try to change events , that happened to him and his friends , for the better but instead they only become worse . Edan goes back in time four times and in all those times that he changes the past the future is even bleaker that it was without the changes . Edan ends up killing Tommy and then put in jail where he's beaten and brutalized . He's responsible for having Larry kill Tommy which has Larry put away in a mental ward for the rest of his life and Keyley becomes a hooker and drug addict from the shock of seeing her brother Tommy killed as a young girl . Edan loses both his arms in an explosion that leads his mother Andrea , Melona Waiters , who never touched tobacco , starts to chain-smoke and eventually dies of lung cancer at an early age . And on his last trip back in time Edan accidentally kills Kayley , by trying to stop her father from molesting her , when he's seven years-old and spends the rest of his life in a mental hospital . Even though Edan's father has the same illness as Edan has we never see him go back in time . The end of the movie is a bit of a letdown with Edan putting Kayley out of his life forever when they both were seven years-old and thus not try to go back in time to correct the damage that her father , as well as himself by bringing it up , did to Kayley that led to her suicide . As far as we know time travel may very well be possible in the future but the ability to change past events isn't . Changing the past for the better , if at all possible , is like a game of poker , you never know what hand you'll be dealt . If your able to change past events you can't know how those changes will effect the future and those effect can make the future far worse then it already is . Which is what Edan so sadly found out in the movie " The Butterfly Effect " .
568422	2721657	83107	7.0	Taking care of Business	SPOILERS Somewhat Average movie , with an above average performance by Richard Pryor , about a war veteran coming back home to find that his life turned upside down since he went away . Caught by the North Veitnamese with his pants down Cpl . Eddie Keller , Ricard Pryor , ends up in a communist Vietnamese POW camp for five years . With nothing to eat but rice and roaches and having a pet rat as a cell-mate things pick up a bit for Eddie when he had another US POW Vinnie Diangelo , Ray Sharkey , as company but even that turned out to be a tragedy for Eddie with Vinnie dying , and without any medical care , he signed a statement saying that the US was committing war crimes in Vietnam in order to get Vinnie help . All that did for Eddie , Vinnie seemed to have died anyway , was brand him a traitor , Eddie was later cleared of that accusation , and indefinitely holds up his severance pay for spending five years behind bamboo bars for his country . Back home things got even worse for Eddie by him first finding out that his wife Lisa , Lyne Moody , was living with another man , who together with Lisa blew all of Eddie's savings , and has a young six year old daughter who doesn't even know that he's her father and on top of all that his mom Jesse Keller , Olivia Cole , is in a nursing home that she's about to be thrown out of because there's no money to pay her bills . With no money in his wallet and no money coming in from the US Army Eddie in an act of desperation tries to become a stick-up artiest only to fail miserably ; at one point Eddie was so scared trying to rob a bank that he embarrassingly wet himself to the shock and outrage of the bank teller that he tried to rob . Eddie finally hits it big by following two security men Tank and Mickey , Martin Azarow & Matt Clark , who work for the Fidelity Western Bank into an office building with two suitcases loaded with some $250 , 000 . 00 in cash and securities . Catching one of the security men , Tank , in the mens room with his , not Eddie's , pants down and robbing him at " toy gun " point then taking off with the suitcase loaded with the securities , not cash , Eddie now has to find someone to convert them for him and the only one's who can do that are those who work for the mob . Richard Pryor in his second , the 1978 movie " Blue Collar " was his first , non all comedy role is both touching and courageous as Cpl . Eddie Keller who tries to make things better for himself and his mom but ends up being the real , not the made up , hero in the eyes of his friends in and out of the army . Nice supporting roles in the movie by both Margot Kidder and Ronny Cox as high-priced hooker Toni Donovan and Eddie's fellow GI Col . Powers who tries to ease Eddie back into civilian life . Feel-good ending with Eddie chased by the mob who tried to rip off , not convert , his stolen government bonds and then attempted to murder him . Eddie turns the tables on the mobsters and at the conclusion of the movie ends up , like the song says , taking care of business with everyone the bank the army and the nursing home that his mom is in , including himself and Toni , ending up much better off for it .
568352	2721657	43360	7.0	Jungle Justice : Favors None But Equals All	SPOILERS Interesting little movie about crime and justice , despite it's misleading title , that plays like a morality play about how one can't escape his crimes even in the dark and uncivilized jungle . The jungle where justice seems at first non-existent is in reality more prevalent there then in a big modern city courthouse where it can be twisted and manipulated by both the power and money of the person who stands accused . Van Gelder Manor deep in the Amazon jungle is a rubber plantation run by the ruthless and scheming Barney Chavez , Raymond Burr . Barney feels that he can get away with anything because he's above the laws of man that he has nothing but contempt for . Smart and conniving Barney gets the owners Klass Van Gelder's , Paul Cavanagh , beautiful wife Dina , Barbara Payton , to fall in love with him thus breaking the heart of his native girlfriend Larina , Carol Varga , who Barney was stringing along until he found someone better , Dina . Knowing that Klass had a weak heart Barney provoked him into a fight one evening in the garden outside the plantation . Barney belted Klass knocking him to the ground as he let him get bitten by a poisonous snake which killed him . Breaking Larina's heart and taking Klass Van Gelder's life , as well as his wife Dina , Barney seems to have gotten away with his crimes . Feeling he can now sell the plantation and move with Diana back to civilization and live the good and rich life which he worked so hard to get , or so Barney thought . Unknown to Barney's his crimes did not go unnoticed . The old woman who lived at the plantation Al-Long , Gisela Werbisek , saw what Barney did to both Klass and Larina and invoked , through her knowledge of the Black Arts , the jungle to bring him to justice . Obscure little movie that has a lot more to it then you would think at first about crime justice and revenge and makes you think about it too . More penetrating and thought-provoking then many of the big budgeted films about courts and law that in many cases the criminal gets away with his or her crimes due to a technicality or a smart and skillful lawyer . There are no technicalities or lawyers in the jungle . Good script and acting especially by Lon Cheney Jr . in a supporting role as the native police commissioner Taro . Taro's education in schooling and law books in the outside world was nothing compared to his education in what he learned from living in the jungle during the first 20 or so years of his life ; the jungle that in the end did his work for him .
568826	2721657	80749	7.0	Our celebration tonight is a travesty . We're honoring murderers .	SPOILER ALERT As the seaside town of Antonio Bay revs up to celebrate it's 100 anniversary an eerie and luminous fog , going against the wind , slowly overtakes the local fishing trawler " Sea Grass " and within minutes the entire three man crew is brutally murdered . Inside this fog there's a number of badly decomposed looking zombie-like mariner who are using the deadly mist as camouflage in assisting them in committing their crimes . It's not until later that we and the towns religious leader Father Malone , Hal Holbrook , find out the reason for this Fog / Zombie alliance and it has to do with the very founding of the town of Antonio Bay . After doing a number on the " Sea Grass " and it's crew the Fog creates havoc in Antonio Bay itself causing everything electrical to go haywire . The disruptions also include local radio station KAB who's midnight to dawn music program is hosted by the sexy voiced , as well as looking , Stevie Wayne , Adrienne Barbeau . Father Malone finds at approximately 12 . 04 AM a journal hidden in the wall of his chapel written by his grandfather that puts the fear of God into him . The journal explains , or better yet confesses , the sins that Father Malone's grandfather committed , together with the five other founding fathers of Antonio Bay , that resulted in the deaths of Captain Blake , Rob Bottin , and his crew of five on the trawler " Elizabeth Dane " which happened in the early morning hours of April 21 , 1880 . April 21 is the very day that's now being celebrated by the people of Antionio Bay as the towns founding and 100 year anniversary ! The very effective and startling ghostly photography , with a minimum use of state-of-the-art special effects , more then makes up for the movies very plot-holed ridden screenplay . John Carpenters sharp and tight directions is on par , or in some cases even better , with his previous horror blockbuster " Halloween " that was released two years earlier . The movie also reunites a number of actors who were in John Carpenters " Halloween " that includes the love at first sight couple Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Atkins as the out of town young hitchhiker Liz Solley and the local Antonio Bay fisherman Nick Castle . There's also Jamie Lee Curtis ' real life mother Jane Leigh in the movie playing Antiono Bay's beleaguered , because of the killer Fog , Mayor Kathy Williams as well as Nancy Loomis who also stared in " Halloween " as Mayor Williams ' press secretary Sandy Fadel . The Fog and it's Zombie-like mariners go on a rampage seeking out the descendants of the original Father Malone and his cohorts who were responsible for their deaths by sending them and their boat " Elizabeth Daen " to the bottom of the sea off Antiono Bay's rocky and dangerous Spivey Point . As you would have expected in a case like this it was old fashion greed that motivated Father Malone Sr and Co . to misdirect , with bonfires as navigation markers , the " Elizabeth Dane " to go off course in the dead of night and sink with it's crew as well as the some 200 pounds of gold that was on it . It was that gold that was to pay for building a leper colony for the afflicted Capt . Blake and his fellow leapers on the strip of land that was eventually to become the seaport town of Antoino Bay . In reality it in turn became Father Malone's and his fellow conspirator's's descendants both premature and permanent graves .
568142	2721657	67656	7.0	Bloody Waters	SPOILERS Probably the most influential of Mario Bava's Giallo thrillers " Bay of Blood " set the stage form the mid 1970's and beyond for scores of slasher movies that copied many of the scenes that Brava put into that film . Wheel-chair bound Countess Donari Fedenica is suddenly grabbed by the neck by a shadowy figure and pushed off her wheelchair where she's left suspended in the air to be garroted to death ! The camera slowly moves upwards from the killers shoes to where we finally she his face who turns out to be the Contess ' husband Count Donai Filippo !

This all happens in the first ten minutes of the film without a single world of dialog ! The movie continues on it's gory way that when it's finally over practically everyone in it ends up brutally murdered . The plot , if you can call it one , of " Bay of Blood " has to do with a valuable piece of land on a bay that a number of people what to convert into a vacation resort with the owner Countess Fedenica refusing to sell it to them . This is what leads to the orgy of murder in the movie with everyone trying to get a hold of the land and not at all caring just what they have to do to get it . It's hard enough to follow the conniving and killing of those involved with the lake property but we have thrown into the mix , for what just seems to be a reason to jack-up the body count , a quartet of young people going down to the lake to have some fun . The first couple Brunhida and her boyfriend Robert separate from each other with Brunhida going skinny-dipping in the lake only to run , or bump , into the squid-eaten body of the murdered Count Filippo ! Running buff naked to the cabin where the other couple , Denise & Duke , and Robert are staying Brunhida is hacked to death by an unknown killer who pops out of nowhere . Robert is then quickly chopped in half by the off-camera psycho as he opens the cabin door expecting to see Brunhilda . Later both Denise and Duke totally oblivious to what's happening , as their both in bed doing it , get run through like a shish kebab with a spear by the same unknown killer . Everyone that were introduced to in the film get's brutally murdered in some of the most grizzly scenes even put into a movie , American or foreign , up until that time . There's scenes of strangling impaling knifing slashing and decapitating that by the time the final act of murder happens , a good old fashion shot-gun massacre , your just left too numb and dazed to even react to it ! The film " Bay of Blood " is so blood-splattered and off-the-wall that there's not even a mysterious killer that the audience could try to identify and figure out who he , or she , is . In that the killer finally reveals himself , due to process of elimination , since almost everyone who were murdered in the film had earlier ended up murdering somebody else making the point of the film being a whodunit totally moot . You really have to have both a strong , as well as empty , stomach to be able to sit through and watch " Bay of Blood " . The movie that more then any other horror film opened up the door to the wave of horror / slashers and Giallo horror / thrillers like " Deep Red " and " Tenabre " in Italy and " Halloween " and " Friday the 13th " . As well as their many sequels and imitations that were soon to follow and are still with up even today .

Without a doubt " Chained Heat " is by far the best and most hilarious womens prison movie ever made . As bad as the film is in its unbelievable story and the atrocious acting in it doesn't for a moment let its audience down . Even now , some 25 years after is initial release , " Chained Heat " has never been eclipsed , much less duplicated , in the many bad womens prison flicks that had since followed it .

Officer Palusky is given the task to go undercover to get close to murder suspect Kayle Timler , Steven Webber .

568583	2721657	84732	7.0	Still Life	( Minor Spoilers ) Director Robert Benton borrows from at least seven Alfred Hitchcock films : Spellbound ( 1945 ) Rear Window ( 1954 ) Vertigo ( 1958 ) North by Northwest ( 1959 ) Psycho ( 1960 ) The Birds ( 1963 ) and Marnie ( 1964 ) and comes up with a pretty fair Hitchcockian thriller of his own in " Still of the Night " . The film centers on Brooke Reynolds , Meryl Streep , an antique dealer at the Crispin Antique & Auction House in New York City . Brooke's fellow dealer and lover George Bynum , Josef Sommer , was found murdered the night before and he was a patient of Dr . Sam Rice , Roy Scheider , his psychiatrist who she went to see to give him a watch that George left in her apartment . Brooke wants Dr . Rice to give the watch back to George's wife in order for her not to find out that she was having an affair with him . Dr . Rice agrees to return it to Mrs . Bynum but can't get over the alluring and beautiful Brooke and slowly falls in love with her which gets him involved with his dead patient and Brooke's lover George . Dr . Rice is trying to get over an failed marriage himself and Brooke coming into his life at this important time seems to be just the right medicine for him but it's the baggage that she carries with her , her lovers murder , that puts him in danger as well as Brooke herself . " Still of the Night " is a very stylish thriller with almost no action at all until the final scene and thats what makes the movie work . Roy Scheider is perfect as the meek and troubled psychiatrist Dr . Sam Rice who takes it upon himself to solve his patients murder as he falls in love with Brooke who may have had something to do with it . The usually two-fisted and tough Roy Scheider is very good as the withdrawn and inoffensive Dr . Sam Rice who's driven to solve George's murder in order to clear Brooke from being blamed for it which seems to be whats being made to happen by George's killer . Dr . Rice is also somewhat of a mama's boy with his psychiatrist mom Grace , Jessica Tandy , giving him advice on his breakup with his wife and the solving of George's murder . There's a very good dream sequence in the movie " Still of the Night " much like the one in " Spellbound " that bring out what was really going on between George & Brooke as well as Brooke's dark secret that the killer somehow found out about and was using it to set up and implicate Brooke for George's murder . Meryl Streep , who known more for being an excellent Academy Award winning actress then a beauty queen , was never more beautiful as well as classy as Brooke Reynolds , the mystery woman with a secret who knew much more then what she lead Dr . Rice to believe . Miss . Streep is such a turn-on in the film that even with all her clothes on she had more sex appeal then both Britney Spear and Madonna put together with their clothes off . In fact the only scene that Meryl Streep was nude had nothing to do with her affair with Dr . Rice but when he came to her apartment and was startled to find her getting a rub-down from her masseur Mr . Chang , Hyon Cho ; WHAT A LUCKY GUY HE IS . " Still of the Night " turned off a lot of movie viewers because of it's slow pace and lack of any steamy scenes between Dr . Rice and Brooke Reynolds as well as it's almost total lack of action until the very last minutes of the movie . But it substituted all that with a well thought out story and as for the lack of sex thats exactly what made the movie , or better yet Brooke Reynold , so sexy . Brooke was so gorgeous that she came across as being almost untouchable , and rightly so . A woman as attractive as her should only be looked upon with awe and admiration and not be manhandled , at least until the lights are turned off .

Beautifully photographed , in lushes color , the movie " Summer and Smoke " greatly benefited from the wonderful acting of Geraldine Page as the spinster religious and ultra sensitive daughter of the towns preacher Reverand Winemiller , Malcolm Attenburg . We also can't leave out the great acting contribution in the film by British actor Laureance Harvey . The very British , as well as Lithuanian / Jewish , Mr . Harvey seemed to have made a name for himself in playing Southerners as well as lovable heels all throughout his great but unfortunately short , Harvey died in 1973 from stomach cancer at age 46 , movie and stage career .
568818	2721657	387131	7.0	Profits before People	( There are Spoilers ) Going on a fact finding trip to Loki Kenya with her fellow investigator Dr . Arnold Bluhm , Herbert Kounde , social activist Tessa Quayle , Rachel Weisz , says goodbye to her British diplomat husband Justin , Ralph Fiennes . Tessa doesn't realize that it's the last time that he'll ever see her alive . Tessa is later found gunned down with her African driver on the banks of Lake Turnaka with Arnold no where to be seen . Arnold , who's secretly gay , who was wrongfully reported to be having an affair with Tessa , was later found hanging upside down on a tree limb in the African bush viciously and savagely militated most likely by Tessa's killers . Justin now on a mission to find the cause of his wife's murder goes to Kenya and uncovers a scheme that was secretly worked out on three different continent's . to make a few people filthy rich at the expense of millions of Africans who put their lives and trust in them : the pharmaceutical industry . Notably KDH pharmaceuticals that make the anti-tuberculosis drug Dypraxa . A bit disjointed the movie " The Constant Gardener " jumps from the present to the past in a number of flashbacks that seem to come without warning . That's about the only thing that I can find wrong with the movie . It's basic story is about political and corporate corruption that's straight out of todays headlines . Tassa a long time whistle blower finds that KDH is pushing it's so-called wonder drug Dypraxa on unsuspecting Africans . These Africans are dying by the thousands because of it as well as from major TB epidemic that broke out in Africa and is threatening to engulf the entire world . Tessa gets the facts about Dypraxa from her and Justin's good friend and British diplomat Sandy Woodrow , Danny Huston , with the promise to Sandy that she'll keep quit about it , the secret report . Tessa instead is about to go public to the UN and spill the goods about KDH . That will postponed Dypraxa from coming on the open market for as long as three years if at all . It would also end up costing KDH's stockholders tens of millions of dollars . That's also something that KDH , as well as all the drug companies that have a stake in in the drug Dypraxa , can't well afford to let happen . Justin goes to Kenya to find what was really behind Tessa ' death and becomes a marked man as he comes to the same conclusion that she did . The drug companies were using the people of Africa as human guinea pigs for their experimental drugs and that was resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of them . It was only when Justin went to see Tessa ' friend and fellow activist Ghita Person , Archie Panjabi , in Holland that it , the brutal honest truth , finally sank in . Justin was beaten within an inch of his life by drug company goons who told him that this is his last warning to stop and desist from looking into and exposing their company's unsavory and criminal actions . Justin later finds out that his and Tessa ' close friend , as well as her secret lover , Sandy Woodrow was the one , together with drug company doctor Lobeer ( Pete Postlethwaite ) , who fingered Tessa's whereabouts to KDH . Woodrow also ratted her out to other major drug companies , government front man Sir Bernard Pellegrin . Bill Nighy , the day that she let for Kenya that resulted in her and Dr . Bluhm's murder . It has to be sad that both Sandy and Dr . Lobeer had no idea that what they told Pellegrin would lead to this terrible tragedy . They were only trying to keep their jobs in the medical and diplomatic world . They just thought that Tessa would be detained or thrown out of the country , Kenya , as an undesirable alien but never murdered . Justin now knowing what was really behind Tessa's death and not wanting to live without her decides to share the same fate that she did . Justin goes to Lake Turnaka , the site of Tessa's murder , and waits for the end to come and he doesn't have to wait long . The ending is a bit too optimistic for a down beat movie like " The Constant Gardener " with Sir . Pellegrin and his drug companies , that he fronted for , being exposed at a public form in London . Even that was a little too late with Justin now dead , and nobody willing to stand up and tell the truth . A gigantic epidemic of a deadly and unknown strain of Sub-Saharan African TB is going unreported and unchecked as the world now braces itself for a plague , of what can best be described , of literately biblical proportions .

American Doctor Richard Walker , Harrison Ford , and his wife Sondra , Betty Buckley , arrive from San Francisco at the Grand Hotel in Paris for a doctors convention where Dr . Walker is to be the featured speaker . Finding that his luggage had been switched at the airport Walker calls TWA Airline giving them all the information including the switched luggage ticket number . With her husband taking a shower Sondra is seen answering the door and then disappears out of sight and out of the movie . It takes a while for Walker , who thought that his wife went out shopping , to realize that something is terribly wrong when Sandra doesn't show up and goes to the hotel lobby to find out what happened to her . Walker is later told by the desk clerk that Sandra left the hotel together with a Arabic-looking man . Walker frantic that his wife was kidnapped goes to the local police only to be told that she may be cheating on him , it's something that seems to be very common among married couples in the city . Even the US embassy doesn't seem at all too concerned or caring about his wife's disappearance . That has a desperate and determined Walker go out on his own to track down where she is , alive or dead , and who's responsible for her disappearance . Opening up the switched luggage Walker finds a pack of matches from the Blue Parrot nightclub and the name and telephone number of a person named Dede on it . Walker also inadvertently finds the hidden nuclear trigger that he at first thinks is a SPOILER toy model of the Statue of Liberty . Finding out at the Blue Parrort that Dede is a drug dealer Walker goes to his apartment in the seedy side of the city only to find Dede , Doll Boyer , brutally murdered . Waiting in the hallway Walker sees this young woman Michelle , Emmanuell Seigner , enter Dede's pad and grabs her trying to find out what Dede and herself had to do with his wife's Sandra's disappearance . To Walker's surprise he finds that Michelle , after a bit of convincing on his part , was the person who's luggage she mistakenly has and that she's also some kind of illegal courier for a local Paris drug gang . You and both Walker and Michelle at first think that there's illegal drugs involved with , or in , the luggage that Walker mistakenly received at the Paris Airport . As the real truth slowly and shockingly comes out with the Arab terrorists gang Israeli Mossad and now even the US embassy getting into the mix it becomes more and more evident that there's something far more serious and explosive in that misplaced suitcase . there's also the fact that if the suitcase is ever gotten into the wrong hands it can lead to a nuclear holocaust . It takes a while for " Frantic " to unravel it's storyline , like most good thrillers do , but it's actor Harrison Ford who makes it come alive with his frantic and almost hysterical search for his missing and kidnapped wife Sondra . As he goes together with , an at first very reluctant , Michelle through the length and breath of the city to finally get his wife's kidnappers to release her . This only after a deadly shootout between the kidnappers and the perusing Mossad agents . Which lead to the precious and deadly triggering device to plant itself at the bottom of Paris ' Seine River , where it could do no harm to anyone , courtesy of Dr . Richard Walker .
568786	2721657	31000	7.0	I don't care what nationality a man is , as long as he's Irish	( There are Spoilers ) Just graduating from medical school young Doctor James or Jimmy Kildare , Lew Ayres , comes back to his roots in the little sleepy town of Dartford Connecticut to open up a practice with his old man Dr . Stephen Kildare , Samuel H . Hinds . It doesn't take long for Jimmy to leave Dartford and his parents Mr . & Mrs . Kildare , played by Emma Dunn , as well as his long suffering girlfriend Alice ( Lynn Carver ) , who's been waiting for him all this time , for the big city's , NYC , Balir General Hospital . Dr . Kildare want's to make his mark as a diagnostician and the best place is Blair where the world renowned Dr . Leonard , or Lenny , Gillespie , Lionel Barymore , is in charge not only of the diagnosis but the surgery department as well . Things don't go as well as Jimmy expected in him being chewed out by Dr . Gillespie the first day he started his residency at Blair in front of all his fellow interns . In no time at all Dr . Kildare makes a name for himself in being able to diagnose on the spot illnesses and cure them with almost miraculous medical powers . This makes the grumpy Dr . Gillespie take notice of the young Doctor Jimmy Kildare even though he acts like he's not at all that impressed with Jimmy's almost unearthly healing skills . Dr . Kildare being the morally-minded person that he is get's himself in hot water later in the movie by after first rescuing heiress Barbara Chanler , Jo Ann Sayers , he refuses to reveal the reason for her attempted suicide . Barbara breaking up with her fiancée Jack Hamilton , Truman Bradley , over him not taking her to the Blue Sawn nightclub ended up with horse owner Albert Foster , Leonard Penn , who got her juiced , inebriated , and left her almost dead drunk in one of the clubs private gambling rooms . Staggering out semi conscious into the street Barbara ended up in this Bowery flophouse where she tried to kill herself by turning on the gas oven in her room without lighting it . It seems that Barbara even though the movie doesn't spell it out , it leaves it to the viewers imagination , felt that Foster took advantage of her while she was drunk . The shock of her fiancée Jack finding out that she's isn't a virgin on their wedding night was just too much for Barbara to take and thus decided , in what later turned out to be for the wrong reason , to take her own life . Being a doctor Jimmy Kildare knew that Barbara , after examining her , was not at all the " damaged goods " that she thought she was . It was Dr . Jimmy Kildare's sweet and caring , as well as private , doctor patient relationship that put Barbara off from killing herself again . This in the end cured Barbara of the fears she had in what Foster did , which in fact he didn't , to her . In keeping the truth about Barbara from his superior the administrator of Blair General Dr . P Walter Carew , Walter Kingsford , almost got Jimmy kicked out of the place . It turned that Dr . Lenny Gillespie came to the young and besieged , on all sides , Dr . Kildare's rescue by offering the startled young man a chance to be his assistant which he , at first thinking that the old guy was going to chew him out , snapped up without a moments hesitation . The future now looked bright for Young Doctor Kildare but at the same time looked very ominous for old man Gillespie in that he's suffering for a bad case of melanoma , skin cancer , and he knew his days were numbered . It's in the short time that he had left Dr . Gillespie planned to teach his young potage , Jimmy Kildare , all he knows about medicine before the final curtain comes down on him . P . S Amazingly the movie had Dr . Kildare examine Dr . Gillespie on his condition , melanoma , and he predicted that Ol'Lenny still had some ten years of life left in his gas-tank . Gillespie putting Dr . Kildare down on how ridicules his prognosis is it in fact turned out to be right on target ! Old and feisty Dr . Gillespie would out last young Doctor Kildare , or actor Lew Ayres who played him , in the Doctor Kildare series by some five years ! That's exactly tens years since Dr . Kildare diagnosed the old man telling him that he'll overcome his cancerous condition . In fact after the Doctor Kildare movies came to an end in 1947 Dr . Gillespie , with his portage Dr . Kildare no longer around , was still very much alive and as healthy as he was when the series first started back in 1938 !
568519	2721657	99582	7.0	Dying To See This Movie	" Flatliners " is a very original , despite it's morbid theme , and in a way uplifting movie . It shows it's audience that things that we do to others in life that for the most part we may have long forgotten about will come back to haunt us in death . The difference in the film " Flatliners " is that those who died and were hunted by their past sins were given another chance to come back to life and correct or rectify them to those persons who they killed and abused . Person who were victimized by Nelson , Kifer Sutherland , who killed and David , Kevin Bacon , who abused . As well as Joe , William Baldwin , who betrayed and in the case of Rachel , Julia Roberts , drove to their death . A secret experiment was dreamed up by Nelson and his fellow medical students to see if there's really a life beyond the grave . The students put themselves under , getting clinically flat-lined , and then being brought back to life tell and record what they saw when they were " Dead " . Each student who was put under saw things that they did in life that they thought nothing of and long forgot about with the exception of Rachel . The dead and then revived students then spent the rest of the movie trying somehow to make amends for what they did in order not to have them go insane with guilt . Admittedly unrealistic the movie has the students get all the medical equipment and drugs that they needed for their experiment and preform it on each other . Right under the noses of the doctors nurses and attendants at the hospital they were at ! The students being able to put each other under , from one to five minutes , and then revive themselves was really a bit too much to take . Still you have to give " Flatliners " an + A for originality . Even though the movie had trouble convincing you that the goings on on the screen could have been at all possible in even in the most modern medical facility in the world . Still " Flatliners " does at least try to confront one of the most profound mysteries , of science and theology , in it's own very strange and peculiar way .

Who in the end when he finally has Billie right where he wants her to be , alone and in the house with him , he completely blows it and ends up with himself being blown away in return .
568273	2721657	448564	8.0	You can share anything of " MINE "	( Some slight Spoilers ) Well acted and written story about the heart-breaking loneliness of being abandoned at a very young age and how it's shapes the mind to the point of conjuring up a twisted sort of pseudo-vengeance and false sense of justice on the part of the person effected . Sophie Hartley has been going through very hard and stressful times of late with her mothers unexpected death and having to look after her elderly father . But Sophie's job as a writer and illustrator of children books of-sets them keeping her mind focused on her work . Happily married to Craig with two cute and loving daughters Anna & Ruby Sophie is getting over her moms death until a number of strange things start to happen to her . things which she later strongly suspects are being orchestrated by her new next door neighbors wife , or live in girlfriend , Mara . Mara for her part is at the time working for Sophie's husband Caig , an architect , as his assistant which has Sophie strongly suspect that she's trying to steal Craig away from her . Beautiful but somewhat on the weird side Mara seems to be mimicking Sophie In everything that she does . Even wearing the same cloths that in one case when one of her dresses go missing , Sophie suspects that she stole from her home . Slowly being driven insane Sophie falls behind in her work and almost causes her daughter Ruby to overdose on cough medicine . Because her mind is so out of focus over her fear of Mara and what Mara is trying to do to her and her family . It later turns out that Mara is indeed interested in Craig and pulls out all stops one evening in his office just about throwing herself at him .

The really big surprise comes at the very end of the movie when you think that you've already found out the reasons for Mara's strange and unstable behavior . And it's about as shocking , as well as surprising , as anything you'll ever see in a surprise-ending film . Susan Sarandon and Sam Neill as Sophie and Craig Hartley are excellent as the befuddled and targeted , by Mara , couple who have no idea to what's happening to them throughout the entire movie . with Emily Blunt as the cunning and manipulative Mara pulling all the strings and driving both of them out of their minds and in the case of Sophie almost into prison or a mental institution . It's without a doubt the ending to " Irrisistable " that's so effective yet cryptic , that you have to watch it twice to really figure it out . It will shock you right down to your socks and the soles of your shoes . That and that alone is more then worth the price of admission to the theater or rental at Blockbuster or any other video store in your neighborhood .

McLeod has been after for some two years . Schneider's attorney or mouth piece Endicott Sims , Warner Anderson , shows up at the precinct and tells the precinct captain , or in this case lieutenant , Monaghan ( Horace McMahon ) that his client is willing to give himself up . For some reason Sims want's the brutal and sarcastic Det . McLeod to keep both his hands as well as inciting remarks off and away from his client . It seems from what Sims is telling Let . Monaghan is that Det . McLeod has it in for ex-doctor Schneider over something that happened to his wife Mary some seven years ago long before McLeod met her . Det .

Later taking the doc to be identified by one of his victims , whom he preformed an illegal abortion on , the word comes back to McLeod that she passed away which has him lose his cool and brutally beat the helpless Doctor Schneider into unconsciousness . It's later when attorney finally spills the beans about the relationship between Schneider and Mrs .

Living in the fast lane with fast cars and speedboats as well as women , that he drops almost as soon as he picks up , spoiled playboy Bob Merrick is anything other then what he makes himself out to be ; a spoiled and overindulgent adult who's only care in the world is himself and himself alone and what to do best with his millions in order to make himself happy . This life of fun and games comes to a crashing end for Bob when he , going at speeds up to 180 MPH , crashes his speedboat and ends up near dead in the collision . In order to save this good for nothing fun and adventure seeker , Bob Merrick , the ambulance crew that rescued him had to borrow a resuscitator from the nearby Dr . Wayne Phillips ' home the very moment that Dr . Phillips suffered a massive heart-attack killing him . A great and wonderful man , Dr . Phillips , had to die in order to save a good for nothing and self-indulgent bum , Bob Merrck , but when we go on to hear , from the people who knew him , just what a wonderful and unselfish person the doctor was he wouldn't have wanted it any other way . Leaving a wife Hellen , Jane Wyman , and step daughter Joyce , Barbara Rush , behind Dr . Phillips was found to be bankrupt even with his hospital doing round the clock business with the local inhabitants . It turns out that Dr . Phillips never charged anyone for his services that amounted in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and even more odd never , until he died and was in no position to tell anyone anything , allowed those he treated to tell anyone not even their closest relatives of his good deeds ! Merrick finds out by accident when he illegally checks out of the hospital , while still suffering from a brain concussion , that his life was saved at the expense of Dr . Phillips when he's picked up hitch-hiking by the late doctors grieving wife Helen . Confused and trying to be , for the first time in his life , humble and apologetic Bob makes a fool of himself in trying to pay off Helen with a check of $25 , 000 . 00 for all the trouble that he caused her and her step-daughter as a result of his wild lifestyle . It's later in the movie when Bob drinking and womanizing as usual at a local watering hole gets himself juiced up and then , barley being able to walk , gets in his sports car and smashed it into the fence at artist Edward Randoplph , Otto Kruger , home he finally sees the light . Letting the now drunk and black and blue Bob sleep it off Edward gives him an insight of what a kind and wonderful person Dr . Phillips was and how he effected his life , and the life of everyone else that he came into contact with , for the better . Slowly but surly the effect , of what Edward told him about Dr . Phillips , starts to take hold of Bob in him trying to makes thing better not just with Helen & Joyce but everyone else that he knows but , and this becomes his magnificent obsession .

A shocked and startled Bob is really up the creek now with him having on his conscience not only Dr . Phillips death but his wife's serious injury as well ! Bob vows to do everything in his power to make things right for Hellen and everyone else that he screwed over the years and does it by becoming , what seemed to me , the reincarnation of Doctor Phillips himself : kind understanding unselfish and most of all doing everything he can to help his fellow man and woman . And on top of all that not wanting a red cent for it but also not wanting anyone else to know that he did it , for free , either . The second half of the film is a bit too schmaltzy for my taste , I have to watch my cholesterol , but still I can understand and appreciate it . The motivation that drives Bob , now using the name Robbie Robinson , in getting to help and at the same time fall in love with sightless , and she with him , Helen has him going so far as to enroll back into medical school that he once dropped out of . Becoming a top brain surgeon himself Bob gets the best brain and eye surgeons in the world to operate on Helen to give her back her sight .

Michael begins to realize later the reasons for Tommy knowing so much about Kyle , he's been secretly dating his daughter Shelly , and even more shocking the real reason for his mothers murder that shaped Tommy's mind and turned him into the Dr . Jeckel and Mr . Hyde that he became . The ending of the movie " The Unsaid " is a bit confusing at first with Tommy going wild in his effort to get out of the Holly Health School and almost murdering his psychologist Dr . Wagner and then taking Shelly hostage in the process . But when confronted with the truth by Michael , and seeing that he really needs help , and that a life on the outside will only end with him being either dead or on death row the movie couldn't have ended any other way .

SPOILERS Tightly directed and acted Film-Noir thriller with the only thing a bit off about it is it's somewhat unrealistically surprise ending . Up until the " suprise " was sprung on you the film " The Narrow Margin " had you sitting on the edge of your seat . The movie had you wondering if mob-protected witness Mrs . Frankie Neil , Marie Windsor , would make with her life to the safety of the L . A Hall of Justice to testify against her late husband's , Frankie , mob associates ; the important and upstanding citizens , politicians police and clergy , in the community who they were paying off to do their bidding . In conjunction with the Chicago and L . A police departments L . A Det . Sgt . Walter Brown , Charles McGraw , together with local Chicago Poilce Sgt . Gus Forbes , Don Beddoe are assigned to take Mrs . Neil back to L . A to testify against the national crime syndicate . At the safe-house where Mrs . Neil is being held for her own protection there's a mob ambush of the two lawman as they were taking Mrs . Neil to the rail station with Forbes getting shot and killed . Feelng now that he has a very personal reason to get those who murdered his friend and partner Sgt . Forbes is even more determined then ever to get Mrs . Neil to L . A alive to bring down the syndicate with her explosive testimony . The train going to L . A , and all stops in between , becomes a train of horrors for Sgt . Brown an Mrs . Neil as a group of mobsters enter it on different stops to find out just where Sgt . Brown is keeping his star witness with them having no idea who she is or even looks like . Sgt .

Later he strikes up a relationship with passenger Ann Sinclair , Jacqueline White , whom he got to meet through her bratty little boy Tommy , Gordon Gebert . , whom the mobsters mistake for Mrs . Neil ; the person that their determined to knock off . The movie moves along at a brisk pace and it's not until the big surprise towards the end that we realize that there's been an uncanny twist played on both Sgt . Brown and the mobsters by the higher ups in the L . A police department . The twist ending has to do with getting Mrs . Neil back to L . A safely . It's that twist that ironically not only throws you off but takes away from the movie's believability that it had up until then . Still " A Narrow Margin " is more then worth watching with it's tense-filled build-up and with a fight scene between Sgt . Brown and hoodlum Joe Kemp , David Clarke , in a small and claustrophobic train cabin that has to rank as one of the most exciting in motion picture history .

A role which Bronson has become known for and identified with more then any of the scores of actions roles that he made during his long film career . Bronson as well as director Michael Winner and writer Brian Garfield touched a raw nerve in " Death Wish " with the American people in big cities under siege like no other movie ever did before and , now some 30 years later , after . Since " Death Wish " there must have been made over a hundred films with it's theme but none had the impact that " Death Wish " with Charles Bronson had . A group of tugs get Joanna Kersey's , Hope Lange , address from a delivery slip of a local grocery store and acting as if their delivering her groceries break into Joanna's apartment and savagely attack her and beat and rape her daughter Carol , Kathleen Tolan . Paul Kersey , Charles Bronson , comes home to learn that his wife and daughter are in the hospital rushes over to see how they are . Kersey finds out that his wife is dead and his daughter is mentally destroyed and needs to be institutionalized for life . The whole world around Paul Kersey falls apart like a house of cards and he's left alone with everything that he loved dead or as good as dead . Some time later going to Arizona to do his job as a land developer for his firm in NYC he's given a . 32 handgun as a gift by the person that he worked for Ames Janichill , Stuart Margolis , for the great job that he did for him . One night back home in New York City taking a stroll in the park with the gun on him Kersey is accosted by a local junkie who pulls a handgun on him but Kersey draws first and shoots and kills him . Sick at first over what he did , killed a human being , Kersey like a wild beast from the jungle tasting blood for the fist time begins to roam the streets of New York at night for prey . A vengeful Kersey goes out looking for criminals to put out of commission , like those who killed and raped his wife and daughter , as some kind of revenge and retribution against them . In the process Kersey puts the criminals of the city of New York into a state of absolute terror and panic . In his guerrilla-like actions Kersey knocks off some dozen of them sending the the city's crime rate falling as much as 70 % ! All this with the ineffective , in stopping crime , police being more interested in stopping " The Vigilante " then stopping the criminals ! The movie " Death Wish " hit a raw nerve with the public as well as the local politicians and police because it showed how , in the movie at least , one man with a gun and knowing how to use it can make a difference when it comes to stopping crime . The story is not that unlikely as those against it would want the public to believe . There's been many times when average people took to protecting themselves , with firearms , and did a much better job then the police ; which is just what Paul Kersey did in the movie . That may have been one of the reasons that those in authority were so much against the film . When Bernie Goetz in December 1984 gunned down four muggers , much like Charles Bronson did in the movie " Death Wish " , who tried to attack him in the New York subway crime dropped a lot more then if one hundred policemen were put on the trains . Nobody can doubt now that Charles Bronson's " Death Wish " was not only a major milestone in films about urban crime but also a major milestone in what the public thinks about crime and what's best to do to stop it .

( There May be Spoilers ) Freed after doing a six-month stretch in a federal prison for contempt of congress Hollywood writer / directer Herbert Biberman , Jeff Goldblum , as well as his actress wife Gale Sondergaard , Greta Scacchi , future in the world of the movies and theater in America is all but over . Being the most out-spoken of the so-called " Hollywood Ten " Herbert was especially singled out by the US State Department with him having his passport revoked making it impossible for Herbert to even get work as a writer and director of movies in friendly countries overseas . Herbert is in for one the biggest surprises of his life later in the movie when his friend and fellow Hollywood Ten , and fellow prisoner , film director Edward Dmytryk , Sean Chapman , became a friendly witness to the HUAC Committee and ratted out six fellow travelers , members or former members of the Communist party , with him being one of them . This just about sealed Herbert's coffin with no way from him to redeemed himself from his past activities and being branded a " Dirty Commie Rat " for the rest of his life . It so happened that the year 1954 was a year of destiny for both Herbert Biberman and Edward Dmytryk with both of them directing a movie of high quality that stood the test of time over the years . Edward Dmytryk directed " The Caine Mutiny " for a major Hollywood studio with top stars like Humpret Bogart Van Johnson and Fred MacMurray . Herbert Biberman directed a film about the true story of a labor strike in Silver City New Mexico by low-paid and overworked Mexican zinc mill workers with a cast of non-actors but the very workers and their families as the stars . Baseicaly a movie within a movie " One of the Hollywood Ten " zeros in on the efforts it took to film and later release the ground-breaking " Salt of the Earth " and how the FBI together with a bunch of paid-off local goons tried to prevent that film from ever seeing the light of day . Herbert who was socially conscious all his life and joined the Communist party back in the 1930's . Not because Herbert had any love for Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union but believed , unrealistically , that Communisum was the only way that those hundreds of millions exploited by the big corporations can get their share of the wealth that they provided for them with their hard and back-breaking labor which they got paid next to nothing for . The filming of the movie " Salt of the Earth " was constantly harassed by the US government with it's star Mexican peasant Rosaura Reweitas , Angela Molina , being kicked out of the US , on a bogus passport violation . This had Herbret film Rosaura's scenes in Mexico and had them smuggled back into the US to be edited into the movie . Rosaura final scene in the film is so touching simple and powerful that it ranks right up there with the final scene in " Grapes of Warth " with Henry Fonda . It took until 1965 , over ten years , for " Salt of the Earth " to be released in the United States . " salt of the Earth " showed the American people how the mass hysteria of the late 1940's and 50's Communist witch hunts did far more damage to the American way of life and US Consitution then what all the subversive activities of all the Soviet agents in the US combined could have done .

568108	2721657	77158	8.0	Rock & Roll is here to Stay it will never Die	Looking more like a young and slimmed down Rush Limbaugh then the legendary pioneer Rock & Roll DJ the late Tim Mcintire , who ironically died in 1986 at almost the same age that Freed passed away some twenty years earlier . " American Hot Wax " is tragic as well as prophetic story about Alan Freed who more then anyone else put Rock & Roll on the map and made the saying , like the song says , " Rock & Roll is here to Stay " a reality . Mcintire in the best performance of his career gives it all he's got as Alan Freed and comes across , despite his obvious non-resemblance to Alan Freed , as good as Freed ever was on the silver screen in a number of films that he stared in . The movie starts at the hight of Freed's popularity in 1959 as he's getting together a number of top Rock & Roll singers and groups to appear at the Brooklyn Paramount for his first anniversary Rock & Roll show . The local authorities as well as the big wigs in the record industry have had in in for Freed since he came on the scene back in 1952 in Clevelend . It was then when Freed first coined the word Rock & Roll and , according to them and the blue noses of that time , corrupted the American youth with that wild and uncontrollable music . The movie has the theater raided by the police because it was declared a fire hazard and Freed arrested and the entertainers dragged off the stage as the thousands of Rock & Roll fans go wild . The movie " American Hot Wax " briefly touched on the payola scandal of 1959-1960 that in reality was the real reason for Freed's downfall not the wild scene at the Brooklyn Paramount at the end of the movie . Freed never played a record that he didn't like payola or not and took money to play the records that he liked unsolicited thinking that it was just part of being a DJ on the radio . The fact that Alan Freed wouldn't sign a statement that he never took payola , which was untrue , had him fired from the WABC radio station that he worked for in 1960 . Later Freed , after having brief jobs as a DJ in L . A and Miami on stations KDAY & WQAM , was blackballed out of the music business altogether . Hit with charges by the IRS in March 1964 for back taxes Alan Freed , who was already at that time both unemployed and unemployable , went into a tailspin as his drinking got out of hand and he died in a California hospital , broke and forgotten , of kidney failure on January 20 , 1965 , Freed was 43 years old . There was one irony to Freed's life , and death , that really sticks out and makes you think if there's truly such a thing as fate and destiny . Exactly three months to the day that Alan Freed died on April 19 , 1965 the radio station that Alan Freed made synonymous with himself and into the flagship radio station in playing the music that he loved and died for in the fabulous 1950's . Freed's old station 1010 WINS New York changed it's policy of playing Rock & Roll , or any other type of , music by becoming the first radio station in the nation to go all news all the time , an all-news network , which it still is today . April 19 , 1965 was for all intents and purposes " The Day the Music Died " on 1010 WINS .
568620	2721657	970525	8.0	Is this the right Mrs . Wright I'm talking to ?	( Some Spoilers ) Bittersweet yet funny little short in how to coup with a personal tragedy under the most depressing of circumstances . Young cub reporter Niall , Thomas Nelstrop , is given the task to do a story for his newspaper-the Examiner-on the death of a local teenager-Michael Wright-who was killed in a car accident the previous evening . We had earlier seen Niall attending his mother's funeral which had the young man's mind , who was crying uncontrollably , on other things besides his work as a reporter for the town's newspaper . Knowing from his previous work that the young man isn't exactly up up par in conducting interviews Niall's colleague Tammy , Sally Bretton , walks him through in how to correctly , and sensitively , interview Michael's mom Mrs . Wright , April Nicholson . Tammy keeps stressing to a very attentive Niall who , if his interview sells papers , may well get a promotion out of all this that it's important to use the word " Tribute " in telling Mrs Wright about the story he plans to write about her deceased son . Going to Mrs . Wright's house and trying to be as cool and professional as possible Niall to his complete surprise gets the exact opposite response from the grieving mother ! Mrs Wright doesn't seem to care , or know , if her dear and beloved son is dead or alive in fact she invites a startled Niall to a home cooked meal that she had prepared for him ! You at first think that your watching an episode of the " Twilight Zone " in how everything seems to be completely out of whack with reality . It's later that it becomes apparent that a tragic event like the loss of a family member , in this case a son , can drastically distort a person's thinking in trying to blot out that tragedy . SPOILER ALERT Mrs . Wright handled the death of her son the only way she could and that was by making believe in her mind that it never happened . If both Niall and Tammy ever went through the terrible experience of what Mrs . Wright did they , instead of being shocked and bewildered by her actions , may have very well understood her .
568870	2721657	38622	8.0	He might have been following the organ grinder but it was the monkey that he was really after	( There are Spoilers ) Almost unbearable at times to watch tear-jerker about a young man working himself up from he slums of New York City as a concert violinist . Then getting involved with a rich socialite who would have never as much as looked at him . Falling in love with the violin at a very young and tender age Paul Boray , John Garfield , wanted nothing more in life then to play his violin to the detriment of his parents grocer Rudy Boray and his wife Esther , J . Carroll Naish & Ruth Nealson . It was Paul's mother Esther that at fist bought him his first violin for his 10th birthday thinking it would make a sensitive and caring person out of little Paul . Esther not wanting her son to be a baseball player like his father Rudy wanted him to be but little did she know that it would turn Paul into a selfish and unfeeling Frankenstein monster instead . Growing into manhood during the Great Depression Paul couldn't bring himself to do any manual work to help out his family during the hard times . Instead he spend hours upon hours practicing his music with the only real friend he had pianist Sid Jeffie's , Oscar Levant , who was almost as crazy as he was when it came to being obsessed with music . Sid also seemed to be immune to the aging process with him not looking a day older from the time when we first saw him when Paul was a little boy to when the movie ended with Paul being a man in is mid 30's ! In fact Sid looked like he was getting younger as Paul was getting older as the movie's chronology moved from the 1920's into the post WWII 1940's . It must have been the liquids that Sid was drinking , water from the fabled Fountain of Youth , during the movie that kept him looking so young . Paul got his big break when Sid invited him to a party gathering of the rich and famous on 5th avenue that was hosted by the filthy rich and blue-blooded socialite Helen Wright , Joan Crawford . It was only when at Sid's insistence , to Paul's disdain , Paul was asked to play his fiddle to the stuff shirts at the party that all hell broke loose . It was after his jaw-dropping performance that , as they say in Paul's old neighborhood on the lower East Side of Manhattan , the rest was " His Story " for the remainder of the movie . With the word of mouth spreading all over New York and places far and wide about Paul's amazing ability to play the violin all the doors to the world of concert music , with the help of the very rich and influential Helen Wright , were suddenly flung open to him . Paul still has that lower East Side combative attitude that no matter how hard he tries he can't shake off . Which in fact make's the classy and refined upper East Side Helen fall heads over heels for the young man even though she's still married , in name only , to her equally rich but not stuck up husband Victor , Paul Cavanagh , who eventually agrees to give Helen a divorce . It doesn't take long for Helen and Paul to become an item in the local gossip columns with the two lovebirds sending all their free time together at Helen's many estates all around the country notably at Helen's waterfront mansion on the Pacific coast . It there that we have a number of really hot scenes between the two making out on the beach with the waves rolling to the the sounds of Paul playing his violin to the music of " Humoresque " the title of the movie . Madly in love with Paul Helen gets a divorce from her husband Victor and now feels that the road is clear for her and Paul to get hitched and live happily ever after in unimaginable , to the common people , wealth and comfort . What Helen doesn't realize is that she has a rival for Paul's love and affection , that's far more formative then any woman , which is Paul's music . In the end it's the music that wins out with Paul leaving Helen all alone drowning in her sorrows in a sea of liquor tears and finally 15 to 20 foot high ocean tidal waves . Even though you wouldn't expect it John Garfield and Joan Crawford who was some six years older , and looked at least ten to her the very youthful-looking co-star in the movie John Garfield , really clicked in all their love scenes together . Paul in the end could not break himself away from his music and even the loss of Helen didn't seem to effect him at all . After a brief period of mourning life and music returned to normal to Paul . Paul was a man who's only purpose in life was to play and perfect and keep perfecting his music . With him being the perfectionist that he is Paul could never be satisfied in what he does no matter how good he does it until death do them , him and his violin , part .
568850	2721657	68699	8.0	Drifting Winds	Clint Eastwood revives his signature role as " The Man with no Name " as he seems to come out of nowhere from the distant prairie and descends upon the sleepy little town of Largo and after that things there will never be the same again for the people who live there . A film that has a lot more to it then what you see at first with Eastwood not being that mysterious and having a past which is seen in flashback every so often in the movie . Styled a lot like " High Noon " but with a twist that builds up slowly at first then takes off like a loose bronco to it's dramatic and fiery conclusion . " High Plains Drifter " doesn't follow the well worn standard western scenario which is why it make it unique and thought-provoking at the same time . Eastwood was never better here as the cool yet pragmatic stranger who's very anonymity makes him both mysterious and threatening to everyone he ruins into , friend or foe . Over the years since " High Plains Drifter " was released , back in 1973 , it has reached cult statues and Eastwood has never made another western as good and as " High Plains Drifter " and that includes " The Unforgiven " . Eastwood is more then a match against those out to get him but what they , his enemies as well as the audience , don't know until the very end of the movie is that Clint has something , besides his quick guns and steel nerves , that is far beyond that of mortal man .
568364	2721657	44314	8.0	There's no such thing as " Trust " in the spying business	( There are Spoilers ) It's March 1944 and things aren't going that good for the Germans in Europe with them being thrown out of the USSR and desperately holding on to their former alley Italy holding off the allied forces there who are within artillery fire from Rome . With all this going on the Germans need all the help that they can get and they get it in the form of the valet to the Briitish ambassador to Turkey an ambitious civil servant in His Majesty's service Ulyesses Diello , James Mason . Diello has had it with his life that was going nowhere and wanted to make it big and then check out to South America , in Rio De Janeiro , and live like a king but the only way he can pull that off is by spying for the Germans and getting his hands on top secret information . Diello plans to get this secret information from his boss the British ambassador Sir Frederic , Walter Hampden , when he was outside of his office , which seems like all the time , attending as well as entertaining parties and state dinners . Getting in touch with the attaché of the German ambassador to Turkey Count Von Papan , John Wengraf , a guy named L . C Moyzisch , played by Oskar Karlweis , Diello later given the code name , by Ambassador Von Papan , " Cicero " . Diallo Impresses the German diplomat so much that Van Papan get's in touch with Berlin so he can get the go ahead to do business with him but at a price : 20 , 000 in British Pound Sterling . Deillo's plan at first works flawlessly with him getting his hands on every piece of information , that always top secret , that's sent to the British ambassador . Photographing the documents and , after getting paid by the German government , Diello then sends it on to his contact , Moyzisch , in the German embassy . Despite his ability to be secretive Deillo foolishly gets involved with the stateless and almost destitute , the Germans confiscated all her property money and holdings back in Poland , Polish Countess Anna Staviska , Danielle Darrieux . Deillo had the hots for Anna since he met her back in London before the war as her late husbands valet . Being a bit too trustworthy in a business , spying , where trust is a dirty word Diello lets his both pants and guard down and gets it where it hurts him the most both in his wallet and bank account . Diello gets zinged not only by scheming and double-crossing Countess Staviska but the German Government as well , in the end which will , like it did Diello , completely blow you away . Tense filled and exciting movie about spying that has going for it the fact that it was based on a true story where more then anything else we see just how true the saying " Truth is stranger then fiction " really is . Diello has nerves of steel in his nerve-wrecking attempts to get a hold of British Military secrets that if caught can have him take a long walk and short drop at the end of a rope . Manipulating both sides , the German & British , in keeping him alive and free in order to find out whom his contacts are and how much he actually received and sold to both warring parties , the British and Germans , has Deillo playing for high stakes in both money as well as his life . Even though Diello screwed a lot of people in the movie he got the royal screwing in the end with his lover the two-timing Countess Staviska checking out on him and going to neutral Switzerland with all his cash , 130 , 000 Pound Sterling , just when he was about to check out together with her to South America . Diello gets in touch with his contact Moyzisch , whom he'd since discarded , for one last deal in getting him , and his German boss ' , for a cool 100 , 000 Pound Sterling the plan to invade Europe by the allies , Operation Overlord , and open up a second front against Germany later that spring . By sticking his neck out in getting the information from the British ambassador's office safe , that was rigged with an alarm , Diello blew his cover and was now a marked man by both his former employer the British Government as well as his collaborators The Germans . The two were tricked , by the sneaky Countess Staviska , into thinking that Diello was working either for the British or Germans as a double-agent giving both sides bogus information . This miscalculation on the Germans part had them throw away the actual plan by the British and US to invade France in June 1944 which if they believed and acted on it the Germans may well have prevented the allies from invading and conquering Western Europe . At the same time , with a second front no longer a reality , The Germans would have been able to defeat the Red Army and thus win the second World War . One of the best spy films ever made not only because of the superior acting , especially by James Mason as Diello / Cicero , editing and directing . The very fact that it really happened shows just how close Hitler's Germany was in winning the Second World War even as late as the spring of 1944 when most people in the allies camp , both in government and the military , thought that the war was just about over and that Nazi Germany would be defeated by Christmas 1944 at the latest . Nazi Germany in fact held out together with it's Fhurer Adolph Hitler for five more long brutal and bloody months with just the Western Allies alone , the British & Americans , suffering well over 300 , 000 casualties in the desperate , by the defending Germans , and no holds bar , by both sides , battle of Western Germany until the war finally ended in Germanys total defeat in the spring of 1945 .
568027	2721657	799954	8.0	Now I can finally end it all !	Gut wrenching documentary about people deciding to end their lives by taking that final plunge off the rust colored Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco Harbor . The filmmaker , Eric Steel , of the movie " The Bridge " spent months filming the Golden Gate and caught , for the most part by accident , on film some two dozen people jump to their deaths , and one who survived , off it . The movie centers on one of those unfortunates who ended up killing themselves a troubled and mentally unbalanced young man named Gene Sprangue . We get to see Gene all throughout the movie walking back and forth , like a caged tiger , along the public walkway on the bridge as if he's not quite sure what to do with himself . It's very evident what Gene's fate will be by his friends being on and off interviewed in the movie on what a tragic life he lead and why he's not here with them anymore . As the movie is about to come to an end we finally get to see Gene , who stopped walking around in circles , casually step up on the railing of the bridge and then without as much as moving a muscle free fall , not jump , straight down to the raging waters below . Falling the 220 some feet to the bottom of the bridge the 34 year-old Gene hits the water with such a sudden and an explosive like impact that he's never seen again until , off camera , his broken and shattered body is fished out of the water by a SFPD or Coast Guard patrol boat . Luckily not all the suicide attempts off the Golden Gate Bridge were successful in the movie with young Kevin Hines , also caught on camera , crossing himself and them jumping off a ledge to what looked like certain death . Kevin had his Guardian Angle , in the form of a harbor seal , with him who kept the dazed and badly injured young man from going under , and drowning , long enough in order for him to be rescued by the Coast Guard . The shocking scenes in the movie of people jumping to their deaths was reminiscent to those horrific videos of persons jumping out the the top floors of the World Trade Center on September 11 , 2001 . The only difference is that the bridge jumpers did themselves in freely and voluntarily where those of the WTC jumped to their deaths in order to keep themselves from being slowly roasted alive from the flames that were about to engulf them . There was also the fact that the bridge jumpers never gave any inclination , which made it almost impossible to stop them , until the very last moment that they were determined to kill themselves ! This made their deaths far more unexpected as well as shocking , to those unsuspecting people on the bridge with them , then those at the Trade Center who's immediate fate , in having no chance at all to survive , was a foregone conclusion . Since its opening to the public on May 27 , 1937 the Golden Gate Bridge has had some 1 , 200 persons choose to end their lives by jumping off it . The film " The Bridge " documents those who jumped or fell to their deaths off the Golden Gate in 2004 alone that number some two dozen very disturbed and unstable individuals . Many of them had given up on life a long time before they decided to take their own lives with " The Bridge " being their only way out of the misery and suffering that they found themselves in . It in the end was the Golden Gate Bridge itself that , like a fire attracting a moth , first attracted its victims-the suicide jumpers-to it's 220 foot walkway and then have them end it all by becoming a part , in the over 1 , 200 people ended their lives on it , of its dark and troubled history .

With the person in question knowing about Norman's accident , that wasn't reported in the news , and then building a house of Tarot Cards and setting it on fire begins to get the best of Norman's fragile mind and subconscious as he starts to see a demon , in the form of giant eagle , attacking him . Rushing to his house Norman does see it on fire , just as the the Torot Cards predicted , and saves Tansy's life but the person who conjured up all this evil on him and Tansy has a quick and stunning reversal of fortune as the movie ends . You never really know if what was happening to Norman and Tansy is real or just their imagination but that's exactly what made the movie " Burn Whitch Burn " or " Night of the Eagle " work so well . Like the great Lawton / Tourneur film-noir horror movies of the 1940's " Burn Whitch Burn " lets your mind , not the special effects , do the thinking and thus literally scares the hell out of you .

568459	2721657	180093	9.0	Something about life that you won't learn in school or college	SPOILER ALERT Dark and gruesome but at the same time extremely realistic movie about the use and addiction to drugs both legal and illegal and the tragic results to those involved . The movie " Requiem for a Dream " doesn't take place in the ghettos of the inner cities that we're used to seeing stories like this but in the middle-class and mostly Jewish neighborhood of Conley Island in Brooklyn NY . The story of " Requiem for a Dream " centers around four people , Sara , Eilen Byrson , her son Harry , Jared Leto , his girlfriend Marion , Jennifer Connelly , and Harry's best friend Tyrone , Marlon Wayans . Sara lives by herself with her son Harry in a high rise apartment in Conley Island . Widowed she watches TV and wants to be a contestant on a show that she loves but feels that she's too heavy and not attractive looking enough to be on TV and have all her friends see her . Sara's son Harry is a local neighborhood hustler who steals TV's or whatever else he can get his hands on to make some money to get himself through the day . Harry's girlfriend Marion seems to come from a good family but she's in love with Harry and as we all know that " Love is Blind " . Marion doesn't seem to care what Harry is doing and where he might well end up , she just want's to be with him , and feels that they both together will somehow make a go of their lives because Harry has a good mind for business and will work himself up the ladder at whatever vocation he takes up . One day Harry's best friend Tayrone comes up with an idea that they can all make lot's of money by selling drugs and that he has a connection that will get them started in the venture . Meanwhile Harry's mom Sara gets a reply to an application that she sent to the TV show that she watches all day and night that she's been accepted to be on the show as a contestant . Sara starts trying to lose weigh by taking pills that she buys over the counter or what her doctor prescribes to her and in no time all she becomes addicted to them . Harry Tyrone as well as Marion at first are making big money in their drug business but after a while with the threat of the police as well as other rivals drug dealers , and not to mention the addicts that they deal with , their drug business starts to dry up . Before long all three like most drug dealers also become addicted to the very drugs that they were selling . Darren Aronosfsky's " Requiem for a Dream " is one of the most depressing as well as realistic movies about urban life in regards to drug addiction that's ever been filmed . I have to remind the readers that it takes a very strong stomach to be able to sit through and watch the movie . In the end we see what drugs can do the the human mind body and spirit and it isn't very pretty . Hollywood has come a long way in the making of movies about drug addiction since the Frank Sinatra Film " Man with the Golden Arm " back in 1955 . " Requiem for a Dream " is a movie everyone should see regardless of it's really disturbing bleak and down right pit-in-hell ending . If it were made back in 1955 when " Man with the Golden Arm " was released and if millions of people saw it back then the drug problems of today would be a hell of a lot smaller .
568156	2721657	62765	9.0	A Bullitt For Steve	SPOILERS Even though the movie " Bullitt " is known for it's legendary car chase scene , this in 1968 when everything was done for real not in a studio with computer enhanced imagery , the movie is also a very fine crime / drama straight out of todays headlines and has a very good and brainy plot too . Senator Walter Chalmers is holding a special Senate Commission on Organized Crime in America in San Francisco and has a very important witness Johnny Ross , Pat Renella , coming from Chicago to testify . Chalmers Wants to make sure that Ross is protected from the mob who beside testifying against it has also stolen $2 , 000 , 000 . 00 dollars from them and they want him dead and will go to any lengths to get him .

Just before Ross entered the hotel he made a number of Phone calls one was to a hotel in San Mateo Calif . Later back in his hotel room with Sgt . Stanton , Carl Reindel guarding him Ross slides open the lock on the door and just then two men enter the hotel room and blast both Ross and Sgt . Stanton away ; at the hospital Sgt . Stanton survives but Ross dies on the operating table . Let . Bullitt wisely decides to keep Ross ' death secret from Senator Chalmers as well as the media by having Ross ' body put on ice in the hospital morgue , unidentified , under a John Doe . With Ross ' death kept under cover Let . Bullitt checks out Ross ' phone calls , before he entered the hotel room , and finds that the call to the San Mateo hotel was to a woman who registered under the named of Dorothy Simmons . With the Senate Commission hearing the next day Bullitt begins to realize that this dead hood Johnny Ross may not the person that he seems to be . As Let . Bullitt gets closer to the truth about the whole Ross business his life becomes endangered by the two killers , Paul Genge and Bill Hickman , who killed Johnny Ross in his hotel room . This sets the scene for the thrilling and exciting car chase that the movie is noted for . Setting him up for an ambush on a deserted San Francisco street Bullitt turns the tables on the killers by backtracking and then surprises and chases them into a hot corner . We have the two killers and Let . Bullitt flooring the gas peddle and tearing up the roads and highway in and around San Francisco and the Bay Area . The exciting car chase comes to an end when , after trying to shoot at Bullitt's car with a shotgun , the killers auto loses control and smashes into a gas station with both of the killers ending dead and burned to a crisp . Back at the police station Bullitt starts to check out the mysterious Mrs . Simmons , the woman who Ross called before he was killed , at her hotel room in San Mateo and finds her murdered . Looking at Mrs . Simmons ' luggage Let . Bullitt and the police find out that she was really a Mrs . Renick and was scheduled to leave San Francisco , with her husband Edward , on a plane trip to Italy ? whats going on here ? Checking Mrs . Renick aka Simmons husbands passport photo Bullitt realizes that Johnny Ross who was killed at the hotel room was really her husband Edward Renick a car dealer from Chicago with no mob connections . Renick must have been paid off by the real Johnny Ross , Felice Orlandi , to impersonate him with Ross taking Renick's passport and identity and checking out of the country and away from the law and the mob who were both looking for him ! Ross must have also double-crossed both Renick and his wife by having them murdered . With the real Johnny Ross now heading for the San Francisco International Airport to make his getaway Let . Frank Bullitt is the only one who has a chance to stop him and as it gets closer for Ross ' flight to take off for Italy the chances of him getting caught are getting slimmer by the minute . Terrific police / action / drama with an ending at the airport , thats as good as the great car chase seen earlier in the film , that left everyone gasping . Also good in the film is Jackie Bisset as Let . Frank Bullitt's girlfriend Cathy who had trouble accepting Frank's job as a policeman especially by seeing up front and personal , the murdered Mrs . Simmons / Renick , what that job did to him as well as what it was doing to her her by living with him .
568668	2721657	317248	9.0	Life & Death on the mean streets in " The City of God "	SPOILERS The movie " The City of God " starts where it ends with a bloody showdown between the Li'lZe mob and their very young allies " The Young Runts " having it out with the Carrot and Ned Knockout gang . Sandwiched between those two scenes are a number of brutal killings that dull your senses and condition you for the movies ferocious and climactic bloodbath . Savage and surrealistic movie about life and death in the slums of Rio de Janeiro and how great the odds are for anybody surviving in that " Hell on Earth " . The movie starts out with eight young men growing up in " The City of God " with only one of them remaining alive by the time the movie is over . Rocket is by far the most sympathetic of those in the movie as he tries all throughout the film , and in the end succeeds , in overcoming the odds against him to become a productive and law-abiding citizen but also a top Brazilian newspaper photographer . I felt that it was Ned Knockout who was the best example of how those mean and deadly " City of God " streets drive both young and old alike into a life of crime and violence even , unlike Rcket , if they do their best to avoid it . Ned a quiet and peaceful young man was publicly humiliated by the brutal and vicious thug in the movie Li'lZe . Not having tortured Ned enough Li'lZe and his gang came to Ned's home where they murdered his brother Gelson when he tried to defend and protect Ned . This tragedy was compounded when Ned in a rage killed a number of the Li'lze mob and then joined up with the Carrot gang to battle the Li'lZe mob and their Young Runt allies . During a bank robbery by the Carrot mob Ned shot and killed a bank guard who's son Max later joined the Carrot mob to avenge his fathers death . In the final street battle in the movie Ned is shot and killed by the son of the man that he murdered Max as he was trying to save his , Max's , life . All this after Ned was shot and badly wounded by the Li'lZe mob . Both Ned and Max were at first innocent bystanders who turned to crime because of circumstances beyond their control and ended up both killing and getting killed in the whirlpool of violence that engulfed the " City of God " . The movie plays like one of those 1930's and 40's Warner Brothers crime movies where neighborhood crime becomes a part of the lives of those who live there and the theater audience can only accept the violence on the screen since there's no way for those in the movie to get out of that brutal environment . The acting in the film by mostly a cast of unknowns is surprisingly good with a very skillful directing effort by L . Mireiles . Mireiles keeps the story flowing smoothly and keeps the violence in check and at the same time makes it very effective and realistic . The ending of the movie with Li'lZe getting blasted to pieces by a group of the members of " The Young Runts " his allies who turned on him , many of them then under 12 year old , showed how the cycle of death and violence continues . A none ending cycle of death and destruction that effects those living on the mean streets and knowing nothing else . Even at a very young and impressionable age in the pitiless and merciless horror called " The City of God " .
568167	2721657	82089	9.0	Steam Heat	SPOILERS Steamy melodrama set in Florida during the middle of a record heat wave which was nothing like the heat generated on the screen by the two stars , William Hurt & Kathleen Turner , in the movie . Ned Racine , William Hurt , a local lawyer one hot steamy night at a town concert meets sexy and sultry Matty Walker , Kathleen Turner . The results of that chance meeting leads to a sizzling and torrid affair and ends in murder and deception and finally the loss of Ned's freedom in what has to be one of the most erotic and well thought out " Film Noir " movies ever made . Unlike the great " Film Noir " movies of the 1940's like " Double Indemnity " and " Out Of The Past " to name a few " Body Heat " is not hampered by the restrictions and limitations of the Hayes Commission back then . That's the reason it's much more interesting and less predictable then movies at that time were . Matty who's husband Edmund Walker , Richard Crenna , had her sign a prenuptial agreement before they were married wants him dead so that she can legally inherit all of his wealth . Matty talks a love stung and unsuspecting Ned into killing Edmund not knowing that she's only using him and will drop him as soon as her husband is dead . Ned goes along with the plan even though it seems to be against his better judgment . Even later when Ned starts to realizes that he's some how being set-up to take the fall he's still so infatuated and in love with Matty that he can't seem to help himself from going along with her scheme to kill Edmund . Edmund , the unfortunate husband of the scheming and deadly Matty , in spite of being an astute businessman and good judge of human nature as well as tough as nails doesn't see what's coming in what Matty has in store for him until it's too late . Good early career performances by Ted Danson , Peter Lowenstein , as Ned's friend and fellow lawyer and Mickey Rourke , Teddy Lewis , as an accused arsonist who Ned got off and who later reluctantly gets involved in the murder plot on Matty's husband Edmund . Teddy at first tries to have Ned change his mind about murdering Edmund but without any success . Also very effective in the film is Oscar Grace as J . A Preston a detective and friend of Ned who despite being on to Matty from the start is blind-sided by what Matty's ultimate plans really were , like everyone else in the movie . Superior story and acting with a really unsuspecting ending makes " Body Heat " not just one of the best " Film Noir " movies of all time but the one that all movies of that genre are to be compared too in the future .
568766	2721657	55872	9.0	Penetrating and Thought Provoking Movie	SPOILERS A movie that you can really say is ahead of it's time about the aftermath of a nuclear war that destroyed over 90 % of the human race . And due to the radiation left over from the nuclear bombardment lowered the birth-rate to 1 . 4 % . Making it impossible for the human race to survive without the creation of a massive robot population to do the work that is needed for human survival . The trouble with that is that the robots have been so improved over the years that they took on more and more human qualities . There coming to the point that they are more human then humans , that is their perfect . That makes most humans think that they'll take over the world and make humans second class citizens . A group is founded called " The Order of Flesh and Blood " that wants to put the robots back to where they no longer pose a danger to the human race . That would mean going back to the time when the human race almost destroyed itself in a nuclear war . It's because that humans have emotions that override logic which robots don't have . Cragis , Don Megowan , one of the founders of " The Order of Flesh and Blood " orders a raid on the home of a scientist Dr . Raven , Don Doolittle . Dr . Raven is working to create a more perfect robot that will pass for human without being detected . Ravan wants the robots to eventually replace humans in government positions so that human irrational emotions and behavior would not endanger the earth , as well as the humans themselves . When the Order breaks into Dr . Raven's laboratory he has one of his human looking robots kill him . To prevent him from from being subjected to have his brain and thoughts dismembered , finding out what he knows and did by the Order , and with that have all his work discovered and destroyed . Cragis , in a speech to the members of the Order , uses Dr . Raven's death as an excuse to make that the robots are dangerous and should be dismantled and used only sparingly . Not to be used in as many functions for the human race as they are being used now . After Cragis's speech one of his colleagues tells him that his sister Emse , Frances McCann , is having an affair , rapport is the word used in the movie , with a robot . If this ever comes out , Cragis is told , it would hurt his position in the Order . Cragis goes to see his sister to get her to break off her rapport with the robot , Pax , David Cross . In Cragis's conversation with his sister , as well as with the robot Pax , something very unusual happens ! What transpired after that in the movie makes Cragis see what the truth is and that changes him forever . Great movie with some of the most thought-provoking , penetrating and intelligent dialog about life death God the soul and the continuation of the existence of the species . Dialog that you'll ever hear in a serious film about those subjects , It will also make you think like you never thought before about the future . The scene between Cragis his sister Esme and the robot Pax as well as Cragis's girlfriend Maxine , Erica Elliot , alone is enough to make you change your views about what you think that the future is going to be . And with an ending that will leave you speechless and at the same time hopeful for what the future will bring . It's too bad that the movie " Creation of the Humanoids " is not on tape or DVD and hasn't been broadcast on TV for the last fifteen years or so . The movie viewing public is missing a real eye-opening film about future events that will shock and at the same time assure us about what we are to face ahead .
568792	2721657	74695	10.0	Men ' O War	SPOILERS It's spring 1943 in the Taman Peninsula with the once invincible German Army in full retreat . After the German Wehrmacht suffered a disastrous defeat at Stalingrad earlier in the year the Red Army then launched a massive 500 mile offensive along the souther sector of the Eastern Front . One of it's main objective is to recaptured the Crimea and Taman Peninsulas and it's there where the movie " Cross of Iron " takes place . Sgt . Steiner , James Coburn , had been out on reconnaissance with his platoon and during a fire fight with the Soviet troops he captures a young Russian boy that later , instead of having him shot , not only spears his life but escorts the kid back to the Russian lines . Sgt . Seiner expecting that he'll be taken back by his comrades in the Red Army the boy soldier is instead machine gunned by the Reds before he could reached their trenches . This is how war is depicted in Sam Peckinpah's classic " Cross of Iron " cold impersonal and deadly where in the end there's no winners but only losers on both sides of the battle-line . Undoubtaly the most shocking and effective anti , or even pro , war film ever made this side of " All Quite on the Western Front " " Cross of Iron " shows what war is really all about and how it effects by almost totally dehumanizing the men who participate in it . Taking over Steiner's company is an arrogant and pompous Prussian aristocratic jerk Capt . Humptmann Stransky , Maximilian Schell . Capt . Stransky wanted a transfer from his cushy assignment in occupied France to the bloody and hell-fire Eastern Front so he can earn himself the coveted Iron Cross . We see right away that Stransky and Steiner don't at all care for each other since in Stiner's case he already has earned an Iron Cross and is anything but overjoyed by it . Referring to the Iron Cross Sgt . Steiner says that it's just a worthless piece of medal but Capt . Stransky is so obsessed by the German war decoration that he goes so far as to blackmail one of his men Let . Triebig , Roger Fritz , to falsify a sworn statement , which Sgt . Steiner refuses to do , to testify to his courage in battle . During one of the many battles that Steiner & Stransky participated in a Let . Meier , Igor Galo , lead a counter-attack against the attacking Reds , which cost Meier's life , repulsing and thus keeping the Russians from overrunning his infantry company's defensive positions . Stransky was hiding in his bunker during the entire Russian assault . After the dust cleared Stransky tried to get the credit that the dead Let . Meier earned by telling his superior Col . Brandt , James Mason , that it was he , Captain Stransky , who manned the guns and passed out the ammunition during he fighting not Meier . It's later when Steiner is wounded in action and hospitalized , for a severe concussion , that Capt . Stansky's orders from Col . Brandt to receive an Iron Cross is just about finalized . Yet the very fact that Steiner is still alive and not willing to go along with the ridicules sham of Strasky being a war hero , which he's not , that leads that low-life Prussian swine to do everything in his power to not only get Steiner but his entire platoon killed in a sick act of revenge and cover-up . Great study of how war brings the worst , as well as best , out in people . With a heroic but disenchanted Sgt . Steiner not only fighting the enemy Red Army but his own superiors . With the only thing he cares about , and is willing to give his life up for , is the men in his platoon . In the end even Sgt . Steiner's platoon , by then reduced to only two men , has no attachment to him anymore . Steiner leaves it and goes after the hated Stransky who was responsible for having it mowed down . When the platoon , together with Sgt . Steiner , tried to make it's way back to the main German lines . Caught in no-mans land in a vicious cross-fire between the Red Army and fellow German troops , under the command of Stransky's boot-licking lackey Let . Triebig , Steiner's platoon was wiped out almost to the last man . Triebig's own men couldn't continue , when they realized that they were shooting on their fellow German soldiers , to keep firing on Steiner's platoon with a totally outraged Steiner jumping into the trenches where Let . Triebig was trying to make a run for it . Cornering the rat after the gutless coward pleaded for his life telling Steiner that he was only following , Capt Stransky's , order . Sgt . Steiner then blasted Triebig to bits and pieces reloading his machine gun at least once as he kept pumping away . It's now left for Sgt . Steiner to come face to face with Capt . Stransky and make him answer for what he did to him and his men in his selfish quest for the Iron Cross . A medal that he planned to get at the expense of the lives of men who were far more qualified to get it then he'll ever be . A once in a lifetime movie about war and the courage cowardice and self-sacrifice that comes along with it . An outstanding cast headed by James Coburn and Maximilian Schell leaves it's audience with a real insight of what war is really all about . As well as a unique experience of how men , and women , are changed forever by both living and suffering through it .
568845	2721657	117381	10.0	Extremely underrated thriller ; Not to be missed	SPOILER ALERT I was surprised looking at the IMDb top 250 movies that " Primal Fear " isn't among them while the more elaborately made and overrated thriller " The Usual Subjects " is listed as # 17 among the all time best in motion picture history . Both movies have narratives that build up to a shocking and surprising ending but the movie " Primal Fear's " ending fits right in with the story that it's presenting and doesn't take anything away from it . While at the same time when you see the movie again for any clues for the surprise ending as hard as you try you can't find them because the ending was , in the true sense of the word , a total surprise . " Primal Fear " is really one of those movies that has a good story that builds up the suspense level with acting and directing and delivers a shocking ending . The film climax not only stuns the audience but makes total sense and doesn't take away anything from the story that you saw up to that point when it hits you . Where as " The Usual Suspects " surprise ending seems totally contrived and completely negates the story that you were seeing up to the part that you were hit by it that the movie plot that you were watching becomes utterly senseless . Marty Vail , Richard Gere , is one of Chicago's top defense attorneys who likes to take on high-profile cases for a hefty fee or Pro-Bono as long as it gets him publicity and embellishes his already envious reputation . Marty also believes that everybody no matter how repulsive their crime , which there accused of deserves to be defended to the utmost of his ability . One morning in a bar watching the TV Vail sees a live news report of the police chasing down a young man who is reported to have murdered a very powerful and popular man from the Catholic Church Archbishop Richard Rushman , Stanley Anderson . Smelling publicity in defending that person , if he's not killed by the police or ends up killing himself , Vail uses his connections to get on the case defending him . At the jail-house talking to the young man Aaron Stampler , Edward Norton , he finds out that he's a 19 year-old altar boy at the church that the Archbishop was in charge of . Stampler tells him that he blacked out , lost time as he puts it , when he came into the Archbishops office when he heard that there was someone else there . Stampler blacked out but when he woke up from his unconscious state he found himself covered with blood and the Archbishop was dead ! Seeing that he just panicked and ran . The state wants the death penalty for Stampler and assigned to prosecute the case Janet Venable , Laura Linney , who once had an affair with Marty Vail and is very surprised that Vail is handling the case for Stampler's defense . Before he's to go on trial when Stampler is examined by a defense paid psychiatrist Dr . Molly Arrington , Frances McDormand . It's then discovered that he has a split personality and is not in control of himself when his other self takes over his mind and he becomes " Roy " , a completely different and violent person ! Marty Vail later also finds this out the hard and brutal way about Stampler's condition by being banged around by " Roy " . It's determined by Dr . Arrington that Sampler is a very sick person and should get help in a mental hospital not in a prison but since the trial is already on Vail can't change the plea from not guilty to innocent by reason of insanity . Vail later finds out that Stampler was sexually abused by the Archbishop by tracking down a video tape with the Archbishop having Stampler and other altar boys and girls engage in sexual activities while he watched . The tape would not only be very embarrassing to the church but to a lot of high powerful people in the city and state government if it were released . Vail sends a copy of the tape to the prosecutor , Miss . Venable , so it would force her to use it at the trial . At the trial State Prosecutor Venable has the tape played , to the total shock of those in the courtroom , to show that Stampler had cause and reason to murder the Archbishop . Just as Vail expected , by releasing the tape to Venable , the case starts to backfire against her . It's then when Vail puts Aaron Stampler on the stand to be cross-examined by Miss . Venable who aggressive and belligerently questions him on the archbishops murder he goes completely berserk . " Roy " takes over Aaron's mind and attacks Miss . Venable and almost ends up breaking her neck . Everybody decides , the Judge as well as the prosecution , that Stampler is insane and not responsible for his actions and drops the murder case against him . I's agreed that he needs to be in a mental hospital and not in a state prison ; but the story is not over for the movies shocking and surprising ending is just about to happen . One of the best crime / court dramas ever made with outstanding performances by , of course , Edward Norton , Richard Gere , Laura Linney and everyone else involved with the acting in the movie . Don't miss seeing it you won't be disappointed , you'll be rewarded with one of the best crime / court dramas and surprise ending movies of all time .
