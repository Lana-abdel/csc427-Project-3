568043	2721657	75845	3.0	What's Going On ?	( Slight Spoilers ) Running neck and neck with the ridicules " Exorcist II : the Hieratic " as the worst movie of 1977 " The Chiorboys " is about the most off-the-wall cop movie ever made that was so bad that even the book's author Joseph Wambaugh , that the movie is based on , disowned it never wanting to be mentioned in the same breath with the film . Having a bunch of beer and booze guzzling as well as mentally unstable LA police officers make complete fools of themselves is not very funny as the movie want's it's audience to think . These yo-yo's end up causing more trouble to the community as well as themselves then any gang of street thugs could possibly do and were supposed to like them ? There are a number of cops who have very serious mental hang-ups that leads to suicide and in the case of police officer Sam Lyles , Don Stroud , involuntary manslaughter but what that shows is how lax the LAPD is in allowing men with serious mental problems into it ranks . The cops in the movie " The Chiorboys " screw up almost ever assignment that their put on but what get's them in trouble is when Lyles , drunk and locked up in a police paddy wagon , goes wacko and blows away a park hustler when he tried to help him . Were shown at the beginning of the movie that Lyles has been suffering from a sever case of claustrophobia since he was in Vietnam but yet he managed to get into the LAPD where , being assigned a deadly weapon , he may very well be put in tight places where his phobia would take over his common sense . There's also the sad case of officer Baxter Slate , Perry King , who's suffering from very dark sexual hangups dealing with S & M that leads him to get involved with a dominatrix . When discovered getting his rocks off by his fellow cops Baxter begs them for help , all Baxter wanted was for them to talk to him , but is ignored which leads to him , feeling ashamed and abundant , shooting himself . With these two cases of police driven to he edge and beyond it's very hard to find anything funny in the movie that's supposed to be a police comedy / drama about the inner workings of the LAPD . Remarkably the most touching and understanding scene in the movie has to do with the uncouth and scuzzy head of the vice squad Sgt . Scuzzi , Burt Young . Talking to a young man picked up for soliciting in the park Sgt . Scuzzi takes the time to talk to him and treats the frightened 18 year-old with kindness and understanding like a father not a hardened cop on the beat . It turned out that Scuzzi letting the boy off without being booked didn't end his problems with him getting shot and killed later in the movie . Very uneven at best and mindless and offensive , to every race color and creed , at worse " The Chiorboys " totally misses the mark that it , and author Joseph Wambaugh in his book , tried to make about the pressures of being a policeman in a major US city . We get a bunch of stories of cops who are so unstable and unprofessional that they come across worse then any of the criminals in the movie and end up getting the worse of it when their ever called upon to arrest or restrain them . There's even a very disturbing scene when two of the cops Rules & Proust , Tim Mcintire & Randy Quaid , are on a roof trying to stop a woman from jumping to her death . Rules encourages instead of trying to talk her out of it where she ends up jumping to her death . The very contrive ending with officer Whalen , Charles Durning , confronting his boss Chief Deputy Riggs , Robert Webber , about him suspending some half-dozen officers , involved in the cover-up of the Lyles shooting was about as corny and unconvincing as it could get . That was supposed to be the high point in the movie that would make you forget just how silly and hare-brained it was up until then . Instead of making the movie " The Chiorboys " better it made it even worse if that at all was possible .

568489	2721657	93676	4.0	The high cost of living and low cost of dying in L .	( Some Spoilers ) Dull as dishwater slasher flick that has this deranged homeless man Harry , Darwyn Swalve , out murdering real-estate agent all over the city of L . A because of the high prices that they charge for their proprieties . Looking like an extra from a Clint Eastwood " Spaghetti Western " Harry who's been living in abandoned houses eating dog food get's very upset where his quite lifestyle as a squatter is interrupted . This happens when a number of real-estate agents invaded his space in an attempt to sell the houses , that he's staying at to their potential clients . Joseph Bottome stars in this bottom-of-the-barrel horror movie as radio talk-show host Dr . David Kelly the handsome and popular host psychologist of the KDRX survival line . DR . Kelly is being sued by the family of one of his callers , Tracy , who ended up blowing her brains out while on the air with the doc who couldn't do anything to help her survive her ordeal of taking to him . The real-estate killer gets to talk with Dr . Kelly on the air about his adventures and the police try to get the doc to get his phone number and address , by keeping him on the line , but he refuses to in order not to hurt his rating by having potential callers not call in in fear of being monitored by the LADP . Kelly also is having a hot and heavy affair with a real-estate manager and agent the busty Lisa Grant , Adrienne Barbeau , who's office of sellers are Harry's main victims in he movie . Harry also gets to murder Lisa's main competition in the housing business the chubby and outrageous Barney Resnick , Barry Hope , who threatened to put Lisa out of business by any means possible even if he has to kill her . Getting Berney alone and with his pants down Harry slices his head off while he's being entertained by one of his clients , a hooker , whom he leaves dead and hanging together with the headless Barney . The movie ends with the deranged Harry taking Lisa hostage and having Dr . Kelly try to come to her rescue only to have Det . Shapiro ( Robert Miano ) , looking like e hasn't slept in a week , pop out of nowhere and blow Harry's brains out . Harry quickly come back to life minus the gay matter between his ears and gets himself killed for the second time in the movie by being thrown from a balcony and landing on the ground as a dozen members of the LAPD , M16 cocked and ready , come on the scene . Nothing in the movie " Opean House " worked with the tension laughable to almost non-existent . Even the hot sex scenes between Dr . Kelly and Lisa didn't save the movie since there were far too few , only two , of them and and sexy Adrienne Barbeau was a bit too underexposed , with not enough light and too much clothes on , in all of them . Harry the killer in the movie was also a bit to comical to be taken seriously in trying to make a point , to Dr . Kelly on the phone and in person , about the high rents and real-estate prices in the country and how people like himself find it almost impossible to find a decent place to live in . You can sympathize with Harry's concern about the high cost of living but be very critical of him in how he crazily went on in correcting it .
568924	2721657	197750	4.0	Looney Tunes	SPOILERS " Paranoid " is a really weird movie about a fashion model Chloe , Jessica Alba , getting involved with a couple of nut-jobs in the little town of Davon on the quiet English coast . We also have Chloe getting harassed by some crazed stalker who's constantly calling her on her cell-phone and how he got Chloe's number , well you'll just have to stay to the end of the movie to find out if your still awake by then . Being set up by her boyfriend Ned , Gary Love , Chloe goes to Levens Hill Lodge in Davon for the weekend and ends up drunk and on drugs and when she comes too she finds out that all the guests at the lodge , except her , are gone . Chloe also finds that her boyfriend had more then just two timed her but that he was married to one of the guests that was with her at the lodge Eve , Gina Bellman , which hurt and greatly upset her . Stuck with nutty Stan , Lain Glen , and his burnt out wife Rachael or Ray , Jenne Tripplehorn , and Stan's creepy younger brother Gordon , Ewen Bremner , Chloe is trapped there with nowhere to go . Drugged and drunk Chloe is video-taped by Gordon having a good time with the trio and when she recovers she goes into the living room and finds a video-tape . Watching it on her TV Chole sees another party with not only Stan Gordon and Ray but also Ned with a girl drunk or doped up and partly naked . When Stan finds out that Chloe saw the tape he freaks out and in the end tries to have her murdered . I couldn't for the life of me figure out why Stan was so whacked out over a more or less harmless tape of him and his friends partying with the girl who wasn't a minor and didn't really seemed to be abused by anyone on the tape . We see her voluntarily take her clothes off and at one point on the tape she seems to have passed out . That was about the worst that happened to her and it wasn't brought out that she ended up dead injured raped or missing sometime after the tape was taken . Even if the worst did happened to her , she was found murdered all Stan had to do was destroy the tape and nobody would know if it ever existed , or if he knew or had anything to do with the girl on it ; but to kill Chloe for seeing it ! now that's crazy ! It may very well have been Stan's state of mind that was saturated with both drugs and booze over the years that may have given him this paranoid reaction and the burnt-out Ray and dopey Gordon in the end went along just to placate him . The two heroes in the movie " Paranoid " were really not what were used to seeing as heroes in films : Theresa , Mischa Barton , who was Stan and Ray's deaf mute and ping-pong playing 15 year-old daughter and Clive , Kevin Whately , a girl-watching weirdo who lived across the street from Chloe . Theresa drawing where Chloe is , the Levens Hill Lodge , and pasting a photo of her on the drawing sends it to the police . Clive who was watching Chloe with a pair of binoculars from his apartment across the street from her became alarmed when he didn't see her for days and then tracked her down to the Levens Hill Lodge where she was held hostage by Stan . Ned who supplied girls to Stan for parties and got his supply of coke from him in return got very nervous when Stan told him that Chloe had to be eliminated . In the end Ned told the police when they came to Stan's house looking for Chloe what was happening and led them to the cliffs to stop Stan and Gordon form killing her . We were told earlier in the movie that Stan was a big time rock musician a while back and I started to wonder if the heavy music did more damage to his brain then the heavy drugs that he was using in the movie . Stan also fancied himself as a big time philosopher and poet and me and those in the audience as well as those on the screen had trouble keeping a straight face and not cracking up whenever the so-called words of wisdom came flowing out of his mouth . Clive came to Chloe's rescue , together with the police , as Stan and Gordon tried to push a car with her locked up in the trunk down the cliff into the ocean . When Stan saw th cops all hell break loose as he told Gordon to distract them by not letting then hear Chloe's banging from inside the car-trunk . The not too bright Gordon dim-wittily banged against the trunk of the car like he was playing the bongo drums to drown out Choles screams ! Clive runs down and chases away both Stan and Gordon and prevents them from killing Chloe and as he's driving his car we hear the American Country & Western song " The Last Roundup " playing in the English countryside . The biggest surprise of all was saved for the end of the movie where we finally got to see who was pestering Chloe on the phone during the entire movie . That revelation only went to prove that the person wasn't who you thought he or she was but that the person was who you thought he or she wasn't .
568577	2721657	74365	4.0	Bigfoot on ice	( Mild Spoilers ) The movie " Curse of Bigfoot " copies the earlier Bigfoot epic " Shriek of the Mutilated " with a Bigfoot hunter Norman Mason going out into the timberland country of Northern California with a troop of collage students to find the elusive man-like creature . Were first shown a number of film clips by high school teacher Dr . Bill Wyman about what Bigfoot-or Sasquatch-is really all about in his many sighting in both North America and the Himalayans Mountains where he's called Yiti by the natives who live there . It's then that Dr . Wyman introduces us , and his students , to a disheveled looking Norman Mason who's never been the same after he and his group of collage students encountered Bigfoot some five years ago . Were told by Mason that three of his students , as well as himself , have suffered deep psychological trauma after that shocking encounter and are now under constant and intensive psychiatric care . It's when Mason recites the story of his , and his collage students , encounter of the legendary Bigfoot that everything goes out of whack in that it isn't about Bigfoot at all ! It's in fact about this unrelated 100 , 000 year old Indian Mummy that he discovered outside the ghost town of Ivanpah California ! The Mummy came to life when it was exposed to the fresh air outside its tomb and , not having eaten in 100 , 000 years , started to search the countryside looking for a free , in that it didn't have any cash or credit cards , meal . The Mummy , not Bigfoot , ends up killing , and eating , a number of people but is later lured into a trap by Mason and his students as well as local Sheriff Walt where it's set on fire and burned to a crisp . The fact that there was nothing left of the killer Indian Mummy made Mason's story a bit unbelievable in that there was no proof at all that he ever had any contact with it or it even existed . Mason's story about three of the students with him ending up institutionalized also made no sense at all in that in his recounting of his amazing story they , the students , seemed to have been totally unaffected in their encounter with the Mummy . The film " Curse of Bigfoot " is actually two movie fused into one , like " They Saved Hitler's Brain " , being made some 17 years apart . The original film the 1958 unreleased " Teenagers Battle the Thing " had of course nothing at all to do with Bigfoot but the aforementioned Indian Mummy . The footage added on with Dr . Wyman was more or less an attempt to make the Mummy into a Bigfoot which turned out , after watching it , to be a complete and total failure . The most interesting thing about the film , far more than its depiction of Bigfoot , is that it has actor Ken Kloepfer in both the spliced together movies , some 17 years apart , playing the same role of Norman Mason !
567997	2721657	85159	4.0	Well at least now they won't have that house to play around with any more	SPOILERS Hell literally freezes over in this third and final chapter of the infamous Amityville House by the river with the place being blown to bits taking an entire crew of ghost investigators , or busters , and ghost detectives along with it . I wondered watching the movie unfold if it was the two investigative reporters for the skeptical Reveal Magazine John & Melanie , Tony Roberts & Candy Clark , trying to be too smart about their ability to expose psychic frauds that lead to the horrors that happened to them as well as everyone else in the movie . Doing their job in exposing psychic frauds both John & Melanie flush out the Caswells , John Beal & Leora Dana , in a phony and staged psychic reading that they gave them for their dead young son Ricky in , of all places , the Amityville Horror House . Feeling good about himself in his job as a " Ghost Exposer " John really goes overboard by buying the dangerous and haunted house himself since no one wants to not only live in it but even live next to it . With John about to move into the haunted house strange things begin to happen . The real estate agent Clifford Sanders , John Harkins , who sold the house to John is found dead by John on the steps of the house from an apparent heart-attack . Melanie who took a number of photos of John and Sanders finds that the photos of Sanders have a strange smug on them that when it's magnified , the smug looks like a little devil . Things start to get out of hand with Melanie ending up dead in a car crash where she burned to a crisp and John's daughter Susan , Lori Loughlin , drowning in the river outside the house . To the surprise of her mom Nancy Baxter , Tess Harper , she's seen alive walking up the stairs to her room dripping wet with a weird smirk on her face . John himself has a few close calls with death in an elevator in the building where he works and in his bathroom when he's confronted with live steam gushing out of the bathroom faucets and the walls in the bathroom closing in on him . With his co-worker , Melanie , roasted to death his daughter , Susan , drowned and his wife , Nancy , going insane John gives in and decides to have his house checked out by a " Ghost Buster " team lead by psychic expert and investigator Eillot West , Robert Joy , to find out and see if there's something to all this tragedy that struck John his family and friends . What the team finds out isn't pretty in that before their through checking out the Amityville House the Amityville House will be through with them . Passable horror movie that does have it moments and at least tries to make some sense to it's audience of what's happening on the screen with a very young Lori Loughlin and Meg Ryan as Susan Baxter and Susan's best friend Lisa who's also a armature medium and psychic in the film .
568891	2721657	157836	4.0	Dead in the water	SPOILERS Sargeant Melissa O'Keefe , Talisa Soto , of the NYPD Missing Person Bureau sets out for Hart Island with a burial unit of convicts to find and identify a young girl . The girl is believed to have be buried on the island's Potters Field and Melissa , who was abundant as an infant herself , has this strong identification with missing persons . Melissa wants at least to have them identified , when found , so that she can put their friends and relatives to rest by not wondering if their alive or dead . At the island there's a ground-breaking ceremony for a low-rent housing project , Hope City , with the city's mayor and multi-billionaire real estate tycoon Rupert King , Malclom McDowell . The hosing development is being built to keep the riff-raft off the city streets and hide them away there from the public for strictly " humanitariam " purposes . The fact is that King has other purposes for bringing the city's unwanted there and it's for him getting rich by using them as experiments for the pharmaceutical companies that he owns . You have to have a real strong stomach to sit through this film with people getting attacked by these super flies who not only infect them with their eggs but who cause their victims to burst open and decompose within minutes . The grossed out scenes in the film have countless maggots crawling out of the infected peoples corpses . The mad and arrogant King had been planing to do this for years by using Hart Island as a laboratory and the use poor and unwanted as guinea pigs . Now with him in trouble financially , he had six major failures in a row , this project The Hope City Devlopment will put him back on top but the over one million bodies buried in Potters Field have other ideas for King and their not very pleasant . It's too bad that almost everyone on Hart Island gets eaten from the inside out by the fly hatching maggots with the person that they were really after Rupert King getting his at the very end . Even though the movie was anything but rational and coherent , especially after some thirty minutes into it , it did for a time hold your interests . The cast also did a much better job then the flimsy material that they were saddled with . There was also the very effective and eerie atmospherics of the spooky Hart Island and Potters field that at times made your flesh crawl . But the plot fell apart with the flies becoming more and more unbelievable as they just seemed to come and go , as if they were out to lunch . Making it possible for those on the island to predict just when it was safe to go outside and eventually escape by boat . One of the most ridicules scenes I've ever seen in a movie is when King is attacked by millions of killer flies and to keep them away from him he blasts away at them with his handgun .
568773	2721657	57181	4.0	You will only do what I command you to !	( There are Spoilers ) Using the harmless front of a fortune teller to recruit an army of mind-numbed , and acid splashed in the face , Zombies Madam Estrella hooked into her dungeon of horrors her latest victim the overly drunk and obnoxious Whitey Robinson . Whitey felt that he was being screwed out of his valuable . 50 for a reading that the Madam gave him . With his faced splashed with acid Whitey is taken by Madam Estrella's faithful assistant Ortega into a room filled with likewise unsatisfied customers of hers . These bumbling Zombies , who in fact are alive not dead , are to be used later in a reign of terror that the crazed Madam inflicts on those she feels don't give her the respect , and money , that she so rightfully deserves . The film " Mixed up Zombies " has the sinister Madam Estrella get the fun loving and sweet Jerry to do most of her evil deeds . Jerry who at first wasn't that interesting of a subject when he had his fortune read by , the mixed-up in the head , Madam Estrella is then , on a second visit , hypnotized by her and sent out on a murdering expedition . For some strange reason Madam Estrella had it in for dancer Marge Neilson who was also one of her customers but unlike like most agreeable with the reading that she gave her : Marge , Madam Estrella told her , was to be murdered within 24 hours ! Marge together with her dancing partner Bill Ward were murdered , actually chopped up , by a hooded and hypnotized Jerry on stage as the two were doing their act in front of a standing room only crowd . Jerry's murder of both Marge and Bill was staged in such a surreal way that it took almost another ten minutes , when the homicidal Jerry attacked his girlfriend Angie , that you realized that it really happened and wasn't just a dream on Jerry's part . The movie , or better yet Jerry's murderous rampage , reaches a bloody crescendo when he together with a dungeon full of mixed up Zombies break out of their confinement killing their master Madam Estrella and her guerrilla-like assistant Ortaga . Mindlessly murdering everyone in sight the Zombies end up getting shot down by the cops at the carnival with the helpless Jerry , who's not really himself , chased down to the beach where he meets his fate on the rocks pounded by the mighty Pacific Ocean . Besides being filmed in color something almost unknown , back in the early 1960's , in cheap and shoe-string budget movies like " Mixed up Zombies " there's also a number of well staged song and dance act in the film . The song and dance acts are amazingly good and far better , which didn't take much , then the films almost indescribable storyline . The films longest and most unusual song number happens just moments before Marge and Bill are murdered by the Zombie-like Jerry . That's when were introduced by the M . C , James Bowie , of the " Hungry Mouth " nightclub , where most of the carnage in the movie happens , to what with the build up that he gets is to be our next American idol and singing sensation Don Snydner . Snydner singing his big hit and signature tune " How Do You Stand With My Heart " is so syrupy and out of tune that for a moment I expected the audience to stormed the stage and do the the same kind of job on Snyder that the mixed-up Zombies got to do later on in the films blood curdling climax .
568397	2721657	97898	4.0	Your now part of the family kid , keep smiling	( There are Spoilers ) Giving the mob a bad name by pushing coke / cocaine on the streets of New York City top mobster John Falcone , David Henry Keller , is called in and chewed out by the head man in the Mafia Don Ricci , Jake LaMatta . Falcone is told that from now on his drug pushing days are over and he's now back to shaking down and skimming off the pension funds of the city unions . Despite Don Ricci decision on his future Falcone has other ideas . Getting in touch with top New York public relations man Tod Barrett , Johnny Stoumper , to reinvent his image Falcone plans to knock off his replacement in the Mafia's drug operations Vince Petracco , Dan Lutsky . He also plans to take over the cocaine pipe-line from Columbia and the Columbia drug cartel in using a mercenary gang of ex-military men to take them out and then take over the cocaine trade in that country . The somewhat naive Barrett gets out tons of TV radio and newspaper spots about the " great humanitarian " John Falcone's work in his helping the poor hopeless and downtrodden of New York . Where behind the scenes Falchone starts a major and bloody gang war that results in dozens of people getting gunned down and blown up all over the tri-state area . With his top rival in the drug business Vince Petracco being blown to pieces , as he was getting his hair cut , at his favorite barber shop in downtown Manhattan . The mob gang war also effects the Columbian drug lords who came to the city to knock off Falchone in revenge for his having their cocaine operation taken over and men whacked . Which leads to them being easily wiped out as their more interested in getting high on coke then improving their aim and working in coordination with Falcone's enemy the Ricci mobsters . While all this is happening Falchone keeps Barrett in line by hooking him on coke-cocaine and later having his friend ace investigative reporter Marty Spostein , Steven Kaman , kidnapped and murder to bring the point home to the now terrified Barrett . Later after Barrett himself was kidnapped and tortured by Falcone's hoods he finds one of the Columbian mobsters stone cold dead in his refrigerator and his wife Whitney , Andrianna Mexwell , missing and possible kidnapped by the Falcone mob . Don Ricci himself escaping from being knocked off by Falcone's hoods lets out all stops to put an end to Falcone's reign of terror against the Five Mafia Famlies in NYC . But it's eventually the yuppie and nerdy PR man Todd Barrett , who reluctantly joins the Ricci Mob , together with part time boxer and Don Ricci hit-man Irish Mickey McCardle , J . Christian Ingvordsen , and Todd's wife Whitney who in the end does Falchone and his hoodlums in . Very violent but at the same time mindless gangster movie that has ex-boxing middleweight champ Jake LaMatta doing a good imitation of a Mafia Don and enjoying every minute of if . Johnny Stumper as Todd Barrett the PR man turned action hero is anything but convincing as he dukes , and shoots , it out with Falcone's hood at the conclusion of the movie . Todd uses up about as much ammunitions as a fully equipped German Panzer Division and not hitting anyone . Todd had to hit the gas tank of Falcone's car to finally put an end to this outrageously unbelievable but at the same time unintentionally funny gangster flick .

Black who was interrogating him that even though he had no love for Frank he didn't have it in him to kill Frank or anyone else for that matter . Momentarily leaving the interrogation room to get a drink of water Albert overhears two policemen on the case saying that Sara killed herself by jumping off the same bridge , where her husband Frank was found , a few days later . Albert quietly recounts the story about him and Sara and Frank and how he was in love and obsessed with Sara and how he resented and disliked Frank for how he abused her in his nightclub and at his home . Albert also talks about how he forced Sara to engage in all kinds of kinky sex that ironically in the end led to Frank's death . Albert recounts about that night when he got a frantic phone call from Sara that Frank was unconscious and possibly dead from one of those S & M sessions that he forced Sara to engage in . It was by answering that call from Sara that sealed Albert's fate in his going along with Sara's bazaar plan to make sure that Frank was really dead . What Albert didn't know was that there was a lot more to what happened to Frank that night and it wasn't just Sara that had something to do with it . Film Noir thriller that is a lot deeper and darker then you would have first thought . Sam Elliott is very good as Det . Black who knows much more then what he lets Albert and the audience on to on what is really behind Frank Carreni's murder as well as his wife Sara's suicide and you seem to sense that as the movie slowly unwinds to it's surprising ending .

568957	2721657	415778	5.0	You took a bullet for the man . Nobody can ask for more then that !	MAJOR SPOILERS With his second term coming to an end as the President , Jack Scalia , is about to give his farewell address to a overflow and cheering crowd in the nation's capital tragedy strikes . As fate would have it he never made it to the podium to give his speech . As the assassin , with a forged journalist badge , pops out of the crowd and gets off a shot the President's personal Secret Service man Alex Thomas ( Cuba Goodling Jr ) , who's job it is to guard him with his life , sticks out his hand and the bullet hits and ricochets off it . This courageous act on Agent Thomas ' part causes the assassin's bullet , that would have missed , to hit the president in the chest leaving him mortally wounded . The assassin Lewis Detimore , Patrick Treadway , is killed on the spot by Agent Thomas and a number of other Secret Service agents before he can get off a second shot that may well had hit the First Lady , Anne Archer , and killed her as well . At first the killer is thought to be your average lone nut assassin with the case of the murdered president solved before the story hit the morning papers . Not for a moment believing the official story nosy and hot-shot Washington Inlander reporter Kate Crawford , Angle Harmon , smelled a big scoop and went after it . Uncovering the dead assassin's background Kate soon realizes that Detimore who was dying of cancer was in fact a Lee Harvey Oswald-like pasty planted at the scene to take the heat off those who really had the president done in . Getting in touch with a now dead drunk and guilt-ridden Agent Thomas , over his inability of not saving the president's life , Kate tries to get him to realize that there's more to the president's murder then what meets the eye or makes the 6 : 00 O'Clock Evening News . It's not Kate who convinces Thomas but a number of operatives , in the president's assassination , who soon end up dead in their trying to murder both him and Kate in order to keep their mouths shut ! Your basic conspiracy movie that has both Agent Thomas and reporter Kate Crawford in the both gun and bomb sights of those who did in the President of the United States . As it becomes more and more obvious to the American public , through Kate's reporting , that the deceased assassin , Lewis Detimore , didn't act alone Secret Service Chief Vaughn Stevens , James Woods , makes the uncovering of who was behind the president's murder top priority . You soon begin to realize that the top priority that Stephens has in mind is really to cover his and is agency's a in not preventing the assassination then in finding out who actually committed it ! Not at first really knowing it Agent Thomas had , in trying to cover up his beloved president's secret life , already solved who was the person responsible and the reason behind the murder the president ! But as it later tuned out Thomas was either too naive or unmotivated , in not consciously wanting to believe who had the president killed , that he completely overlooked it ! SPOILER ALERT The shocking truth , after about a dozen people end up getting killed in the film , to who set up the president and who in fact was the brains behind his murder really isn't that shocking at all . Having stepped on a number of powerful peoples toes during his tenure as the President of the United States those who wanted to do the President in not only had the means in doing it but also very personal reasons for having it done ! And what both Agent Thomas and reporter Kate Crawford were soon to find out , to their utter shock and frustration , is that these very powerful people were too far up the totem pole , in the Washington D . C political establishment , to ever be brought to justice for doing it !
567991	2721657	499456	5.0	The Zombifiation of Planet Earth !	SPOILERS This movie has a new twist , or twist of lemon , on an old story about an army of flesh eating Zombies who are , in their own unique way , impregnating both Earth-men and Earth-women with their mutant offspring's . The Zombies in the movie don't come from the Caribbean or the African bush country but from the residue-that they were exposed to-of a pulverized comet that exploded when it struck the Earth's atmosphere . In the film the few human survivors of this Zombie , due to the dust of the exploding comet , onslaught are holding out in an abandoned underground NORAD command center . Running out of both food and water the survivors headed by former Hollywood macho superstar Chad , Tom Eplin , try to hold out as long as they can until help finally arrives . It's only later that Chad & Co . , some dozen of them , finally realize that their the only humans on Earth that haven't been Zombified ! We get a series of gory and grossed out scenes , like in most Zombie films , of Zombies attacking and cannibalizing their human victims . We also get the added attraction of seeing the Zombies impregnate their hosts by just having their victims breath the air that's filled with microorganisms that were laying dormant , until it hit the earth's atmosphere , inside the comet for millions of years . Back inside the NORAD command center survivors Steve and Mimi , Travis Brorsen & Roshelle Pattison , begin to realize , after a nauseating Zombie autopsy , that Mimi's pregnancy has nothing to do with her cheating on Steve . It was the result of the dust , from the comet , that she was breathing . SPOILERSSteve later also realizes that the way to stop the Zombie menace was as close to him as the nearest bottle of Yukon Jack or Smirnoff Vodka which the underground silo , thanks to Chad , was well stocked with . If Steve only knew this earlier it would have caused a lot of pain and suffering , for him and his fellow survivors , from happening ! Better then you would expect Zombie movie with the Zombies , all 40 of them , besides suffering themselves with human flesh look as if their having more fun then a barrel of monkeys in knowing that even if their dead they can still experience the joys of sex . But not quite the kind of sexual experiences that they knew , and participated in , while they were still alive and human !
568440	2721657	65582	5.0	The only point to the movie is that there's no point	SPOILERS " Cover Me Babe " is one of those anti-establishment type 1970's films where it's main character takes himself , and his future in film , so lightly that it's a wonder that anyone , in the audience or in the movie , take him seriously at all . Tony Hall , Robert Foster , a college student film maker does everything he can to destroy his future career , if he had one to begin with , in film . Tony makes sure that if he would ever need to be financed by a film studios in or out of Hollywood to do a project they would slam the door in his face . Smug arrogant sarcastic and unfeeling Tony goes through the entire movie totally detached from his friends and fellow students as well as those in the film business like Hollywood press agent Paul Rogers , Jeff Corey . That by the time the movie is over Tony doesn't have a friend in the world and at the same time doesn't really seem to care . All Tony wants to do is do is " his thing " which is being snobbish and aloof like those in the establishment that he despises , and who he's rebelling against , and if nobody likes it let them take a long walk of a short plank . Robert Foster tries to be " Medium Cool " in " Cover Me Babe " but comes across totally obnoxious as the very overly conceited vain and pompous as Tony . Tony forces both his girlfriends Melsse & Sybil , Sandra Locke & Susanne Benton , to forcibly make love in movies that he was making with Jerry & Ronnie , Ken Kercheval & Floyd Murtux , who were also friends of his . Tony also doesn't get along with his film professor in college Will Ames , Robert S . Fields , Tony doesn't get along with anyone for that matter . Ames ' is also in love with his girlfriend Meilssa and had an affair with her before she met Tony . It seemed to me that Prof . Ames had a grudging admiration of Tony's talents but Tony was so rude and uncivil to him that in the end Prof . Ames wanted nothing to do with him . Prof . Ames even wanted Tony thrown out of college when he found a film clip of a young couple making out , in a car at a local lovers lane , that Tony secretly filmed without their knowledge . Back at the college studio Tony has Meilsse almost raped on film in an " art movie " he had her " act " in . Later Tony had poor Ronnie , who was very shy with women , forced into a hard core sex scene with his , Tony's , other girlfriend Sybil . This action of Tony's part was so revolting that the cameraman , Sam Waterston , stopped shooting and walked off the set in disgust . Tony did show some talent when he touchingly filmed a derelict , Mike Kellin , at local park who spilled his guts out on how the world , and his ex-wife , treated him . That scene really hit me as well as it did Tony who was filming it . There was also a horrific scene , at a film exhibition in the college auditorium , that Tony shot of a man on a ledge of a high rise building being urged to jump by the people on the streets below , and then did . To the horror of those watching the film , to his death . It's been said that actor Al Pacino , who was a total unknown back then in 1970 , was first offered the role of Tony Hall and for some reason didn't get the part . Not getting that part very probably saved Al Pacino's movie and acting career .
568644	2721657	35784	5.0	Keep Walking	SPOILERS George Zucco , Dr . Llyod & Elwyn Clayton , does double duty here , probably because of the acute manpower shortage in Hollywood due to WWII , as twin brothers who represent good and evil in the movie " Dead Men Walk " as it sluggishly moves to a flaming and Armageddon-like ending . " Dead Men Walk " rips off " Dracula " and puts a different " spin " on it in a tedious and dull version of the famous Bran Stoker novel with George Zucco doing his best to make it all work but to no avail . Dr . Llyod Clayton battling his evil brother Elwyn , who turned into a vampire after his death , who also tries to kill and turn into a vampire like himself Llyod's niece Gayle , Mary Carllsle . Elwyn does this by making night visits , once is not enough ? , to Gayle's bedroom and sucking her blood , thats a new one , and thus making her a charter member of the living dead . The movie also has Dwight Frye as Zolarr Elwyn's creepy servant in death as well as in life always messing thing up for his master . In the end of the movie during the Llyod / Elwyn fire fight Zolarr is pinned to the ground by a fallen pedestal and during the entire scene keeps saying over and over again , ad nausea , to the annoyance of the every one in the movie as well as the theater audience " Master , Master " . The story somewhat confuses you when Kate , Fran Emmett , who's the only one at first in town to know about Elwyn being a vampire and later one afternoon when she's in the cemetery finds where his body has been hidden , by his servant Zolarr . Kate opens up the cover of Elwyn's coffin where you see the sunlight hitting him and instead of him shriveling up and turning to dust nothing happens ? This compared to when Elwyn and Llyod are fighting it out at night in the end of the movie in a burning house , Llyod is the one with the hat on , just the sound of a rooster crowing , thinking that it's dawn , was enough to do in the evil Elwyn even though it was pitch black outside ? the rooster could have also had the wrong time . George Zucco's acting in " Dead Men Walk " was far above the material that he had to work with but he could go so far in making his part , or parts , that he had come across effective and believable without looking silly at times . Dwight Frye did his usual creepy act as the cracked assistant or servant to the heavy , Elwyn , in the movie like he did in previous movies like Frankenstein and Dracula . Mary Carllsle was asleep or in bed in almost all of her scenes in the movie due to her loss of blood with Elwyn obsession in trying to get her to join him in the world of the dead . Nedrick Young as Dr . David Bently , Mary's boyfriend , was like Zucco ; much better then his role in the movie called for him to be . " Dead Men Walk " did have some good atmospherics especially in the graveyard scenes but overall it was just flat and uninteresting and never really scared you at all a total waste for everyone involved ; the cast as well as the theater audience .
568720	2721657	47507	5.0	I don't know how he did it YETI did .	SPOILERS Outrageously campy film about the " Yeti " or " Abominable Snowman " of the Himilayias with the creature looking like a giant Gabby Hayes or Jed Clampet of the " Beverly Hillbillies " . The creature goes around in a tight fur-lined jumpsuit tip toeing through the tulips as if trying not to wake up anyone in the movie or in the audience who may have fallen asleep watching . The creature was found by Dr . Frank Parrish's , Paul Langton , expedition that began in the town of Sherka at the foot of the mighty Himilayian Mountains . Dr . Perrish was going up the snow capped mountains to study plants and flowers , Dr . Parrish is a botanist , only to have his expedition taken over by a mutiny lead by his Sherka guide Subra , Teru Shimada , who's woman was kidnapped by a local Yeti in order to get her back . This leads to the expedition finding a cave high up on the mountain range where the Yeti and his family lives . Finding himself surrounded the Yeti starts a violent cave-in by pulling rocks out of their place killing his mate and offspring and knocking himself out . The Yeti ends up being captured by Dr . Parrish and his Sherka mountain climbers ; and who said that Yati's are supposed to be smart . Brought back some 10 , 000 miles to L . A the local authorities are more interested in the Yeti's immigration status then it's value to science . As their bickering with Dr . Parrish it escapes from an ice-box that it was caged in and goes out killing people on the streets of L . A . You would think that such a major find on Dr . Parrish's part would draw the attention of the entire scientific and anthropological world but in the movie that didn't even raise a stir in those two communities . With almost nobody showing up at the L . A airport to see the " Find of the Century " . The local as well as world media also seemed to be out to lunch or reporting on the latest gossip news , from TV and Movieland , to bother reporting about this historic find . On the loose and in the sewers , it felt more like home for the Yeti there , it terrorizes the city with the police hot on it's tail . Cornered in the sewer system the cops shoot , I don't know if they killed it or not , the Yeti and with that the movie ends . Campy and unintentionally funny film thats worth a look for bad movie fans who won't be disappointed and may even get a few good laughs out of it . The Yeti is so ridicules that every time you see it come on the screen you just can't help cracking up . the Yeti in the film " The Snow Creature " is about as scary as the Three Stooges and almost as funny .
568477	2721657	783239	5.0	Were going on our honeymoon in Hawaii !	MAJOR SPOILERS Supposedly based on a true story the made for TV movie " Engaged to kill " is so off the wall and unbelievable that , if in fact it did happen in real life , it goes to prove the famous saying that " Truth is in fact stranger then Fiction " . The movie starts off with a run of the mill kidnapping of pediatrician Abby Lord who's kidnapper demands from her husband-luxury boat salesman-Robert a cool million dollars if he even want's to see his wife alive again . Not going to the police but going broke in rustling up the ransom Robert together with his 14 year-old son Corey drop off the cash , in an out of the way garbage can , in the designated spot that the kidnapper told him to . Whaterver believability the movie had up until then totally evaporated with the actions of both the kidnapped victim and the kidnapper . Abby , who was supposed to be released anyway , makes her escape from the kidnapper's trailer with the kidnapper's girlfriend Sally getting killed , by falling out of the trailer and getting crushed , in trying to prevent her from escaping . It's then that the kidnapper decides to get even not only with Abby but her entire family by secretly bankrupting them as well as causing Abby to lose her job at the hospital ! This is all done by the kidnapper getting Abby's patients with the help of his accomplice-Sullivan - to accuse her of malpractice . SPOILER It's when the kidnapper , whom were not supposed to know who he is , finally shows up on the scene it becomes obvious just what he's planning to do . Get in good by being Abby's daughter's , Maddy , boyfriend and destroy the Lord family from within ! Of course this sleazy and smirking lowlife isn't up to accomplishing his mission by himself he has help in this mindless goon-Sullivan-that he hired to do most of the dirty , as well as murders , for him ! Everything is so predictable , especially the identity of the kidnapper , that there's no suspense at all in the movie . The only thing that surprises you is just how ridicules the kidnapper was and how he was able fool , among his victims , anyone in the first place . I for one couldn't understand the attachment he had to his airhead girlfriend Sally since he used her , like he did everyone else in the movie , for his own advantage and nothing more . As for the Lord family it was only Abby who finally got the drop on him but not in her realizing that he was in fact the person who kidnapped her ! But in Abby finding the smirking psycho playing - a game of internet poker - with her son's Cory's personal computer ! The ending of the movie was a totally mindless confrontation between the kidnapper with both Abby and her daughter Maddy whom he planned to slice up and force Abby to watch bleed to death . It's then that the crazed lunatic for no reason at all , but just to show how crazy he is , dropped his gun only to end up getting clobbered , with a polo stick , and put to sleep until the police came to finally put him away !
568802	2721657	272065	5.0	Day of Warth	SPOILERS Overlong and extremely violent vigilante movie that despite it's shoe-string budget holds your interests until it gets carried away with itself in trying to reform the major character in it Reverend James Lowery , played by Earl Owensby , from a Charles Bronson-like avenger to a Mahatma Gundhi-like pacifist at the cost of Reverend Lowery's life . Running , out of his church , a rehabilitation center for homeless and drug-addicted youths Reverend Lowery gets the local drug pushers mad at him by taking away their costumers .

Recovering from four gun-shots with his voice gone , due to a bullet shattering his voice-box , Lowery is so despondent that he slips into a drunken stupor not even wanting to see his crippled son Jody at the hospital . Getting to know at the local watering hole that he spends , drinking away his troubles , almost all his free or non-sleeping time Lowery gets friendly with a hooker , with a heart of gold , who calls herself Julie . Lowery ends up staying at Julie's place for days on end without as much as even thinking of having sex with her even though Julie is very accommodating to him , she doesn't know that he was happily married with two children and a man of God to boot . For some strange reason Julie thinks that Lowey is either a cop or soldier who due to his gunshot wounds is unable to preform in bed . Lowery gets a new lease on life when he spots this local drug pusher the Candyman and follows him into the town bus terminal . Getting the Candyman alone in the mens room Lowery clobbers him with his cane and then stuffs his head , together with his drugs , down the toilet bowel drowning him .

With the new found friendship of the town religious blind man Lowery also found peace and quite at the blind mans place so that the hoods looking for him would find it twice as hard , with him spending half his time at Julie's pad , to locate and kill him . The movie " Dark Sunday " get a bit strange with Lowery who at first could barely walk , having four slugs in him , is later able to outrun the cops and hoods , who most of the cops in town are In the pay of , even when they were chasing him in cars ! Lowery finally gets to the top man of local mobs drug operations Hurbert Dexter , who ordered the hit on him and his family , as he was planning to leave town .

Lowery after debating with himself how to finish Dexter off , with a drug overdose of just a bullet to the head , empties out his gun out on the hoodlum ; a gun looking more like a 155mm howitzer that would make even Dirty Harry envious . Instead of ending right there , with the blowing away of drug and mob kingpin Dexter , the movie goes on for some ten more minutes with Lowery having what seems to be a change of heart . Were forced to suffer through this ridicules transformation where Lowery not only turns himself in but serves himself up to be killed by crooked cop Let . Untz the only survivor of Dexters drug cartel . In front of his son Jody and Julie and the the towns police chief , one of the few cop not on the take , Lowery allows himself to be blown away by the corrupt Let . Untz as some kind of penance on Lowery's part . Trying to figure out the ending it then dawned on me that Lowery actually had nothing on Untz even though he had dozens of chances to kill him , like he did a score of other hoodlums , throughout the movie . Lowery used Untz's bottomless and utter stupidity by getting the jerk to shoot and kills him in front of more then a dozen witnesses including fellow cops ! in order to get enough evidence on Untz to put him away for life .

Only ending up getting talked into making porno films by the likes of Gloria and Johnny Ryde to just pay off their bills . We see the tragic story of Mary Smith who ended up making smut films and photos for Gloria and finally fell victim to Dirks sinister urge . When he caught Mary alone in the park , by the duck pond , and ended up raping and murdering her . We also see in the movie " The Sinister Urge " how difficult it is to arrest the likes of Gloria Henderson and make the charges of the crimes she committed stick . Admittedly a laughable venture , which of his movies aren't , of Wood's because of the cheap budget and in some cases non-actors in it . The movie " The Sinister Urge " is still years ahead of it's time thanks to the foresight and vision of it's director Ed Wood Jr , in showing the evils and horrors of the then , in 1961 , underground and illegal smut business in and out of Hollywood . That destroyed the lives of thousands of young girls like Mary Smith in mind as well as body .
568779	2721657	486569	5.0	The Bigfoot from Sasquatch Mountain	SPOILERS Overly talky and underly exciting Bigfoot movie with the elusive Bigfoot , played by the over seven foot tall ex-basketball player " Tiny " Ron , getting less time in the film the its both beginning and ending credits ; About five minutes ! In fact the film " Sasquatch Mountain " is more about a bank robbery gone wrong then a movie about the big footed 800 to 1 , 200 pound , and over seven foot tall , gorilla-like creature roaming the Great American North West . These crooks wearing gorilla or " Planet of the Apes " masks rob a local bank where in the crossfire with the police kill Officer Sirom Sauls , Bob Harter . As the crooks make their getaway they smash into , outside of town , Erin Price , Cerina Vincent , who just left her abusive boyfriend and is traveling to California to start a new life . With the cops lead by the ailing senior citizen Sheriff Zeff , Rance Howard , catching up with the bank robbers the only thing they have to bargain with is Eirn who was taken hostage during the confusion . At this point the movie doesn't seem to know where to go in that it's only some 15 to 20 minutes old and has some one hour of running time left to cover ! So we have this Bigfoot show up out of nowhere uniting both cops and robbers in a mutual cause ! Killing the Bigfoot before he ends up killing them ! In fact we got to see the Bigfoot at the beginning of the film where local town resident Chase Jackson , Lance Henriksen , is fixing his van Chase's wife Sara , Kate Connors , who for some reason is videotaping the great " event " is killed by a runaway car ! In Sara's videotape we see a shadowy Bigfoot running through the woods ! It's later in the movie that Chase who had since become a hermit on Sasqatch Mountain not only tracks down the Bigfoot but the robbers as well . Both the cops and robbers are a mixed bag of nuts who get picked off by the Bigoot one at a time during the film . It seems that Bigfoot is only in the movie to spice it up when things start to get really boring with the endless philosophical exchanges between the two sides . One of my favorite exchanges , or meetings of the minds , is between the kidnapped Erin with the co-leader of the crooks who kidnapped her Kayla , Karen Kim . Talking about how they were abused by their ex-boyfriends Kayla shows Erin her battered and scared behind as if to prove to the unmarked and beautiful Erin that she by far got the worst , beating by her boyfriend , of it . The Bigfoot , or Tiny Ron , himself does what best he can with his part in the movie but is given so little time to do it , despite being the star , that he's relegated to nothing but a cameo role in the few scenes he has in the movie . The few surprises in the film that had mostly to do with the old and grizzled " White Hunter " & " Indian Scout " Eli Van Cleef , Tim Thomerson , came across so flat and uninteresting that when they hit you , after Ol ' Eli was completely forgotten about , they had absolutely no effect at all !
568730	2721657	99893	5.0	With Cardini we don't have a problem . With Lombardi ? He's a Mashugenah ! We don't know what he'll say !	SPOILERS In an effort to get the top honcho's of the notorious NYC's Murder Inc . Mob organization Albert Anastasia and Frank Costello convicted and put behind bars the NYPD had in protective custody the one man willing to testify against them ; Mob stool pigeon Louie Galvan . As it turned out Galvan was guarded in a room on the top floor of the Astor Hotel by two dirty cop , Pete Howard & Ben Dougherty . The two cops allowed gangsters Steve Lombardi and " Tough Tony " Cardini to enter the hotel-room and throw the half-asleep witness out of the window and to his death on the street below . It soon becomes apparent that the only way to get to Anastasia and Costello is to somehow get someone to turn against them , like the late Louie Galvan , who's motives and whereabouts are unknown to them . That's where the newly formed Special and Super Secret Police Squad , answering only to NYC D . A Frank Hogan and the Mayor , comes into play . The Special Squad headed by the brash and confident Det . Johnny Ryan doesn't start off too well in it's attempt to get the goods on New York City's top mobsters . Johnny making a complete jerk of himself goes off so half cocked in breaking the law that he was sworn to enforced that he almost ends up behind bars himself . Johnny doesn't only screw himself up but also screws up the investigation in bedding down Steve Lombardi's , Frank Costello's right-hand man , girl singer and dancer , at Lombardi's Havana Club , Eva Manion . Johnny's macho but moronic attempt to intimidate Lombardi , for no other reason but to throw his weight around , also has a top possible witness crooked cop Ben Dougherty end up getting gunned down by Frank Costello's goons in an effort to shut him up . Pete Howard the other crooked cop involved in Louie Galvan's murder gets so drunk from the pressure put on him by Johnny's Special Squad that he's driven not only to drink , the guys been on the wagon for at least a year , but to the brink of suicide !

Johnny ends up not only getting the by now battered Eva set up for a hit by the Frank Costello Mob but has the only two persons who can finger the Mob Boss , as well as his partner in crime Albert Anastasia , " Tough Tony " Cardini and the vengeful , for what Johnny did to him , Steve Lombardi iced . This all happens when the hit on both Eva and Johnny backfires with the key man , the big surprise in the movie , who set it all up suddenly gets religious , after for the first time in 30 years taking a drink on Sunday , and backs out on the deal ! You have to say one thing about Det . Johnny Ryan and that has to do with the luck , or Luck of the Irish , that he has all throughout the film . No matter what Johnny does he's always bailed out of the mess he created for both himself and those who have the misfortune to be around , Like Eva , or work with , like his late partner Larry Bryant , him !
568150	2721657	993775	5.0	Sweet dreams , baby	( There are spoilers ) Hard to follow made for TV flick with you not really knowing if what your seeing is either real or a dream . The movie has to do with this 1 , 000 years-old Hag , or Evil Spirit , that's been haunting sweet and lovely Molly Duggan's , Haylie Duff , ancestors since it had been kicked out of heaven and made to stay in a state of purgatory ever since . It's not really made clear what exactly Molly's relatives had to do with all this but they , at least the female side of them , had been dying in their sleep ever since and now Molly is in danger of doing the same thing . The movie really starts to get weird when this Rasputin-like wacko Silas , Bruce Ramsey , unshaven and with piercing blue eyes shows up on the scene who happened to be in the same study group " Dream Central " at the collage that Molly is now a member of . Silas who during his travels in the Orient , trying to find himself , had been under the tutelage of a Turkish holy man for three years . Silas instinctively sees in Molly the powers of ancient wisdom that can defeat the the terror that's threatening her and her friends with death when ever they as much as go to sleep . Silas who spent the last three years in a mental hospital after having had a complete nervous breakdown in his attempt to understand what's been going on all around him is now out on the streets and free to make a nuisance of himself . Silas does that by stalking and hounding poor Molly with his off-the-wall theories and his admiration of her mystical and God-given powers to combat the forces of evil in the world . Eventually Molly get's the message when Silas invades her dreams and in a strange way keeps Molly from dying because of them . That in affect makes her a true believer in his powers of perception , of the worlds and dimensions beyond human reality , and drives Molly into having the same kind of breakdown that he suffered some three years ago . It turns out that Silas was right in contacting Molly and giving her the push that she needed in taking on this Evil Spirit and forcing it back into the Netherworld where it came from . Exorcist-like ending with everything going haywire as Molly , now free of fear , takes on the Hag or Evil Spirit single-handedly and at the same time , by kicking it's butt , saves the now comatose and near-death Silas . Somewhat confusing but still interesting film with the pretty Haylie Duff , as the courageous Molly Duggan , battling both insomnia as well as the Evil Spirit from generations past to save whatever is still left to save in the movie " Nightmare " .
568661	2721657	90859	5.0	Sly in a I am the law type of movie	Being a member of the " Zombie Squad " Let . Marion " Cobra " Cobretti is the meanest as well as toughest cop in the city . In the movie " Cobra " Let . Cobretti has his hands full when he takes on a gang of ax wheeling psychos who call themselves " The Way of the New World " led by their leader the " Night Slasher " Brian Thompson . Like in most movies like " Cobra " Let . Cobretti always get in trouble with his bosses as well as the local liberal bleeding-heart lawyers and news reporters for doing things " His Way " . Let Cobretti wastes the bad guys without the benefit of a lawyer or trial as we get to see him in the opening scene of the movie shooting to pieces a " Way of the New World " psycho who crashed a supermarket and gunned down a number of shoppers . These " Way of the New World " psychos are going around the city axing people to death and one of the lucky one's who got away from being split in half by them is beautiful fashion model Ingrid , Brigitte Nielsen , who also got a real good look at the ' Night Slasher " and can identify him . It's around the safety of Ingrid and having her protected by Let . Cobretti , of course , and then be around to finger the " Way of the New World " leader that the plot in the movie " Cobra " is built around . The " Night Slasher " and his gang of cut-ups spend the rest of the film trying to get their hands on Ingrid and turn her into confetti , but they have only one small problem : They have to get past Let . Cobretti to get to her . What spoiled the movie " Cobra " for me is that the bad guys are so cartoon-like and one-dimensional as well as really having no reason for their murderous actions against society . The movie never really explains just what the heck the " Way of the New World " gang is all about ? We see them throughout the film driving around mostly on motorcycles with panty-hose over their heads and murdering people by hacking them to death and about the only reason we get from their leader the " Night Slasher " for doing that is that their victims don't measure up or fit into the " New World " that their creating . Sly Stallone gives a real good Mr . Cool type performance as the ultra-cool-cat and take-no-bull-from-anyone Let . Marion Cobretti . Still Stallone is weighed down in the movie trying to carry his then girlfriend and co-star Brigitte Nielsen who's nice to look at but she'll never be mistaken for Bette Davis in the acting department . Also by then , 1986 , the soft-on-crime angle and cops who don't go by the rules to get the job done movies were already wearing thin with the American public . Tough on crime politicians and law enforcement personnel were being indited and jailed for being in many cases worse then the criminals that they were supposed to be fighting against .
568067	2721657	36791	5.0	The dirty swine ! those filthy skunks ! They beat me for refusing to Hail Hitler !	( There may be Spoilers ) Highly fictional account of the life and times of Nazi Minister of Propaganda and Public Enlightenment Dr . Paul Joseph Goebbels , Wolfgang Zilzer . In fact the movie " Enemy of Women " almost totally overlooks Goebbels involvement with the Nazi Party and his meteoric rise to become one the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and Nazi occupied Europe . As well being his Fhurer's most loyal and trusted henchman who was to stay with his beloved Fhurer in his bunker in Berlin to the very last in April / May 1945 . Then killing , together with his equally fanatical Nazi wife Magda , not only himself but their six young children as well . The film instead concentrates on Josephs very possessive and weird love life . We see the early life of Dr . Goebbels as a failed writer , of dime store novels and stage plays , being kicked around by a young woman who he tried to make out with . Goebbels in then kicked out of the house by the girls outraged father . Depressed and feeling like sht Goebbels wonders into a beer-hall and for the first time hears ultra-German Nationalist Adolf Hitler give one of his hypnotic and spellbinding speeches . He was hooked and joined Hitler's National Scoialist , or Nazi for short , party . Now years later In a position of power Goebbels can get even with all those wise-guys bluenoses and bullies who kicked him around when he was a nobody and a more or less 98 pound weakling in the world of power and influence . Getting even with old Colonel Ebarhart Brandt , H . B Warner , who threw him out of his house when Joseph tried to grab and kiss his actress daughter Maria , Claudia Drake , Goebbels puts out the word to SS chief Himmler that Eberhart is a disloyal traitor to Germany . That has Himmler send a few of his goons to the old mans apartment who end up putting him away with a load of slugs shot into him . Goebbel now seeing his chance to get in good with the bereaved Maria makes as if he's very depressed over her fathers tragic death which , unknown to Maria , he was responsible for . In fact it was Goebbles himself who was targeted for elimination by Himmler but played it cool , after being alerted by his friends . Goebbles gets as close as he could to Adolf Hitler knowing Himmler wouldn't dare have him shot while he was standing next to the Furher . Getting Maria openings in plays and movies , through his connections as Propaganda Minister , Goebbles now expects some payback from her , like being his mistress . Instead she falls in love with charming and handsome Vienna doctor Hans Traeger , Donald Woods , which has Goebbels throw a fit . Before he can do anything the two lovebirds , Mari & Hans , skip out of Germany to Hans ' native Vienna . Married and living in bliss the Traegers have it made in old Vienna until March 1938 when the German / Austrian " Anschluss " happens with the German army marching across the German / Austrian border and uniting the two countries under Nazi rule . Stuck with nowhere to go both Maria and Hans are now at the mercy of the Nazi regime and only with Goebbles ' help can they ever be able to get out of the country , and into Switzland ; but that help will come at a very heavy and heartbreaking price . " Enemy of Women " is more like a soap opera then a historical movie with that rascal and scoundrel Joseph Goebbles having one affair after another with beautiful and buxom Frauleins as Germany goes down the road to destruction in the Second World War . What was Goebbles greatest love in the movie Maria Brandt ends up getting killed in a daylight USAAF bombing raid on Berlin . Poor old and crazy Joseph now all by himself gives one of his lying speeches , to the German people , on how the allied bombing campaign over Germany is a total bust . Goebbles also boasts that if they , the Americans and Brits , ever try to invade " Fortress Europe " by crossing the English Channel they'll get the worst beating of their lives . As usual Goebbles was wrong dead wrong ; he , the real Joseph Goebbles was to die by his own hand less then a year after " Enemy of Women , was released .
568589	2721657	88008	6.0	Hot Rod Man	SPOILERS Drive-in type movie with bar fights car chases and crashes explosions country music pretty girls badder then bad bad guys and a good guy who's just too good to be true . Where in the end everyone gets whats coming to them good and bad thats what the movie " Roadhouse 66 " is all about . Beckman , Judge Reinhold , a spoiled rich kid driving home to California is almost killed by a gang of local toughs Hoot Dink & Moss , Alan Autry Kevyn Major & Peter Van Norden when his 1955 Thunderbird has it's engine almost shot out after he had an altercation with them on the open road in Arizona . Picking up hitch-hiker Johnny Harte , Willem Dafoe , after his car broke down Johnny fixes the Thunderbird so that it can get to the nearest town Bowman Arizona where Beckman can get a new radiator . While at Bowman Beckman and Johnny meet two pretty local girls who happen to be sisters Jesse & Meilssa Duran , Kaaren Lee & Kate Vernon , who really take a shine to them . The boys get a new radiator at Sam's car junkyard and Sam , Stephen Eillott , lets Beckman keep his car in his junkyard garage . Everything seems fine until the three toughs who tried to run Beckman off the road , Hoot Dink & Moss , show up and things really start to get messy . Decent little movie with Willem Dafoe being Mr . Super-Cool as well as a pretty good guitar player . Hoot later beats the hell out of a very drunk Beckman who bet him in a game of pool at the Roadhouse Bar . It's then that Johnny comes to his rescue and ends up smashing up the entire bar in a fight with Hoot . Johnny pays for the damage that he did by going on the stage where his former band just happened to be playing and belt out a song " Marie Marie " that had the bar crowd go wild . Later Beckman decides to enter the " Roadhouse 66 " car race , a race restricted to cars that are pre-1966 models , against Hoot and his gang . It's later that his Thunderbird is set on fire in Sam the junkyard man's garage by Hoot and Sam is killed in the fire trying to put it out . With Jesse giving Beckman her car for the race Johnny who left town to get away from all this excitement and danger later shows up to race in the " Roadhouse 66 " car race with Moss ' car . Moss just had it with both Hoot & Dink after they almost killed him for warning Beckman not to go to the garage where his Thunderbird was set on fire . This time the car race was a lot different then the one at the start of the film with Hoot trying to shoot out Johnny's car engine after he caused Beckman to crash his car in the race . That was after he , Hoot , secretly dropped a scorpion on the front seat that almost stung and killed Beckman . Hoot ends up being up-ended for his effort with his car smashed and him left for dead and losing the race with both Johnny and Beckman ending up with the two girls Jesse and Melissa at the end of the film . It was brought out in the movie that the reason that Hoot gets away , until the end of the movie , with all the trouble that he causes in the town of Bowman is because his dad is a top judge in the state of Arizona . It seemed that his dad didn't teach Hoot a very important lesson about the rule of law that would have saved him a lot of bumps and bruises which is simply : " Crime Doesn't Pay " .
568057	2721657	118615	6.0	I get sentimental when you hold me tight so come on squeeze me , but please don't tease me	SPOILERS Monster from the deep , the Amazon River , type of movie involving what seems like two giant anaconda constrictor snakes , who measure up to 40 feet each , that are on the prowl . The snakes attack a river barge with a film crew making a documentary about the mythical " People of the Mist " a tribe of natives lost to civilization for some 5 , 000 years called the Shirishama . The movie " Anaconda " starts off with what's obvious , with it's title and after the long introduction that we get , a giant anaconda attacking this radio post in the middle of the Amazon basin . The Killer snake has the person at the controls , snake poacher Danny Trejo , so terrified that after trying to hold the unseen serpent off with his hand gun , unsuccessfully , puts it to his head and pulls the trigger . Back on the barge the passengers and their skipper captain Mateo , Vincent Castellanos , start the long trip into the dark and unexplored Amazon Jungle and soon run into this weird Paraguayan river rat who's lost at sea , or in the river , Paul Sarone , Jon Voight . Up until Sarone shows up the movie seems to be going nowhere fast but as he tells the head of the documentary team Anthropologist Dr . Kale , Eric Stoltz , that he knows where to find the " People of the Mist " he's given practically cart blanch to do and go where he want's . What Sarone really wants is to sail into dangerous snake country that's been rumored to have a number of giant anacondas mating and breeding there . Sarone is obsessed with the giant anaconda , after almost being eating by one , and wants to captured one of these monsters to sell , and have displayed in the zoo of a major US city , for a cool million if not more dollars . It takes a while for the crew to realize to what Sarone is really up to but as he becomes more and more unstable and shows his true hand by getting a number of the people on the barge , including Captain Mateo , attacked and eaten by this giant anaconda it becomes obvious what Sarone is trying to do : capture with a tranquilizer dart gun the killer anaconda alive ! With The persons on board just having enough of the crazy snake obsessed Sarone they band together overpowering and then tying the lunatic up . Lost in the wilderness of the Amazon Basin , thanks to the misinformation given to them by Sarone , the new skipper Englishman Warren Westridge , Jonathan Hyde , accidentally runs the barge aground by this waterfall . Having cameraman Danny Rich , Ice Cube , and the director of the project Terrie Flores , Jennifer Lopez , together with Westbridge go out in the water to dislodge it and then sail home to the waterfront town of Manaus makes things even worse . It's then when we really get to see the giant snake go into action finishing off almost the entire crew and giving Sarone just the chance he needed by strangling , like a giant anaconda , with his legs the film projects assistant Denise Kalberg , Kari Wuhrer , who's guarding him and then make a clean getaway . During all this confusion Danny ends up killing the rampaging giant snake , with a number of basts from a rifle to it's head . Just when you think that the movie is about over , with it's star the big snake dead , another giant anaconda this one bigger and even more aggressive and deadly comes on the scene ! You just know that the snake is out looking for a good meal by the way it AGGGGH regurgitates everything that it swallows , man and beast , being that it doesn't consider them to be grade A quality includingSPOILER ALERTthe wild and crazy as well as dangerous Paul Sarone . Almost unwatchable final sequence that has the big snake have it out with both Terrie and Danny who are being held as bait by the craze Sarone , in order to trap and capture the killer snake , only to have it turn the tables on him by catching Sarone with his guard down , and using up his last tranquilizer dart . Looping Sarone with a number of giant coils the snake then snap crackle and pop the guy to death . There's two more scenes with Sarone and the snake that are so gruesome and at the same time eye opening , and also fascinating , that I just can't find any words to describe them . You'll just have to see them for yourselves and then have your stomach pumped out in order to get you back to normal ! Fairly good special effects make the snake , or snakes , look really frightening . The fact that the snakes move , in and out of the water , at lighting-like speeds makes the anacondas even more dangerous in being able to catch their pray , before even throwing their steel-like giant loops around them , and then crushing or suffocating their victims to death . Jon Voight's acting is without a doubt the highlight of the movie , eclipsing even the killer snakes . With a psycho-like grin on his face , that were told was the result of an anaconda trying to swallow him head-first , and what seems like a cheesy German accent straight out of Hogan's Heroe's Voight made every scene that he was in count . Even after Voight was dispatched by the giant anaconda towards the end of the film he still had enough left , or was it that the snake had enough of him , to make a surprise unannounced and final , it's just too much to expect for anyone to even try to think about it , guest appearance !

568914	2721657	45162	6.0	Everyone's just wild about Harry	SPOILERS Long and tiring movie that chronicles the life and times of world renowned writer and big game hunter Harry Street , Gregory Peck . We get the story straight from the horses , Harry himself , mouth as he lay dying on a sickbed in the African bush country from a gangrenous infection . This happened when Harry jumped into a river trying to save one of the natives who fell in that was a member of his safari . Harry if anything was more responsible then the herd of hippos that attacked and killed the native by having the boat go too close to the hippos in order for him to get some pictures . Helen , Susan Haywerd , Harry's wife who's on the safari with him could only hope and pray for help in the way of medical supply to arrive in order to save his life . As Harry goes in and out of consciousness we get to see his life story through his thoughts and feelings and how his cold and selfish personality just about destroyed every relationship that he ever had including the love of his life Cynthia , Ava Gardner . Harry met Cynthia Green in Paris when he was a poor and struggling young writer as they lived together in a one room flat that he had in the poor side of town . As Harry got famous through the books that he wrote he became more and more detached from Cynthia that left her hurt and dejected . Finding out from her doctor that she's with child Cynthia tried to give the good news to Harry hoping that it would bring them both back together . Harry was so cold and unfeeling and at the same time so in to himself when Cynthia was about to announce the coming blessed event to him that not only did she drop the whole subject but fell or jumped down a flight of stairs causing her to have a miscarriage ! Harry , after recovering from the shock of Cynyhina's accident and loss of her and his unborn child , still treated Cynthia more or less like dirt being too stuck up on his own importance to the literary world in the books and article he wrote . Cynthia became so disgusted of him and the way he acted toward her that one evening she just got up and walked out on Harry . Cynthia did that by leaving Harry for a dancer who was preforming at a restaurant that they were dining at . Harry went on his way to become more famous in the world of books and big game hunting and continued to have more and more affairs with beautiful women like Cynthia . But the spark was gone from his life with her no longer being with him . Like joining the French Foreign Leagion Harry joined the fight against Fascism in Spain to forget what he did to Cynthia and it was there that Harry was to unexpectedly find her ! Cynthia also joined the anti-Facists fighters there where Harry found her dying after she was crushed by the ambulance that ran over a land mine that she was driving as a volunteer ! It in a way did bring out the best as well as human side of Harry when she forgave him for everything that he did to her and he showed real emotions for the first time as she practically died in his arms . Harry then forgot himself and ran the opposite way on the battlefield after the stretcher bearers who were carrying away his beloved Cynthia . It's then that he was shot and wounded by an officer in his unit thinking that he was a coward and deserting his post ! By now nothing seems to be going right for him . Even though Harry later married he never forgot the beautiful as well as tragic Cynthia and never forgave himself , even though she did , for what he did to her . Back to the present in Africa in the shadows of the majestic 19 , 710 foot high Mt . Kilimanjaro Harry waits for the enviable and as all hope is just about gone for him surviving . With darkness falling and Harry in all probability never to see the sunrise again there's still one more surprise that fate , or the script writers , have left for him in the movie that's coming Harry's way and this time for once it won't be all that bad . Very dull and boring movie that seemed to go on forever ever with Harry going through all the stages that one would go through from life to death as he's slowly dying right before our eyes . I myself felt as if I I was attending his funeral without him yet being dead . The script writers just should have let Harry die peacefully instead of having the unbelievably ridicules ending that concluded the film . I don't know for sure , since I didn't read the book , that if the ending in the movie to " Snows of Kilimanjaro " was the same as the one in the Earnest Hemingway short story . But I do know that it was one of the worst endings I've ever seen in a film .
568476	2721657	56907	6.0	I didn't write the rules . I only enforce them !	SPOILERS Otto Perminger's three hour extravaganza on the inner workings of the Catholic Church is a bit heavy handed but still worth watching in his star Tom Tryon , as Father Stephen Fermoyle , unique performance in it . Father Stephen's faith is badly shaken when his sister Mona , Carol Lynley , who's both pregnant out of wedlock and on the brink of death . With only the abortion of her unborn child being able to save her life Stephen chooses the life of the child Rigena who's also played , when she's grown up , by Carol Lynley over that of his sister Mona leaving her to die in childbirth on the hospital operating table . Stephen going by his Catholic ethics has the child saved at the lost of Mona's life and that hunts him for the reminder of the film . Temporally giving up the priesthood , but not the vows he took , and becoming a teacher in Vienna Stephen meets and falls in love with one of his students Annemarie , Romy Schneide . It's when Annemarie finds out that Stephen is a Catholic Priest she drops his like a hot potato knowing that the church takes precedence over her . It's some time later when Stephen again meets Annamerie she's happily married to banker Kurt Von Hartman , Peter Weck . It's then , March 1938 , that the Nazis march into Austria and Kurt , being part-Jewish , jumps to his death , out of his and Annemarie's six floor apartment window , to avoid being arrested and put into a Nazi concentration camp by the dreaded Gestapo . Annemarie herself is arrested by the Gestapo in her being accused of trying to escape from Nazi controlled Austria which Stephen , if she only asked for his help , could have saved her from . During that same period , the late 1930's , Stephen risks his life by traveling to rural Georgia to help fellow-and black - priest Father Gillis , Ossie Davis who's church was burned down by a bunch of local Klansman . Being kidnapped and brutally horsewhipped by the hooded Klansman Father Stephen's courage to stand up to them encouraged the local black parishioners to come forward and testify against the head of the Klan in the area that put him behind bars . This , according to the movie , was the first time in the south that a white man was convicted on only the strength of a black man , or black mens , testimony ! Back at the Vatican Father Stephen's boundless courage and convictions for his fellow man has him rise to the point where he's appointed as a Cardinal to the Catholic Church . The movie ends with Father , now Carndial , Stephen telling his audience at the Vatican to follow God's rules and resist the dangers that are now surfacing all over the world in the coming , this is in the early summer of 1939 , conflict with Fascism . A warning that was sadly ignored , by the world powers at the times , and that resulted in the biggest and most destructive conflict , WWII , in human history . P . S Actor Tom Tryon who-as Father Stephen Fermoyle - was told by his superior in the film Cardnal Glennow , John Huston , that he needed to be thought a lesson in humility . Tyron was given that hard lesson by the director of the movie " The Cardinal " Otto Preminger himself . Being constantly yelled and screamed at by the ill tempered and demanding Preminger Tryon needed all the humility he could muster up to be able to finish , and not walk off , the movie set ! This in itself showed what an excellent and , in taking all that guff from Preminger , disciplined actor the late Tom Tryon really was !

Christopher Lee playing the hooded Russian lion tamer Gregor comes upon this suitcase of some 250 , 000 pound sterling in the deserted farm , where he keeps his wild animals caged . The cash was taken in the spectacular armored car robber on the London Bridge at the beginning of the movie . Gregor also finds the body of one of the robbers , who was killed , with a knife in his back , there too . Whoever planned the robbery had the money specifically brought there , the deserted farm house , on the circus grounds by one of his unwitting henchmen corrupt cop Mason , Victor Maddan , and then had him murdered to keep the cash all for himself . The rest of the film " Circus of Fear " has the unseen and unknown killer try to murder anyone who has any idea of who he is . That includes the cheating partner of the jealous and hot headed circus knife-thrower Mario ( Maurice Kaufmann ) Gina , Margaret Lee , as well as the not to on the ball and creepy person who's supposed to smuggle the stolen cash out to the country for the armored car robbery gang Manfred Hart , Klaus Kinski . With some of the stolen car robbery money being passed around the town where the circus is preforming it soon becomes evident to the Scotland Yard chief investigating this baffling case Elliott , Leo Genn , that the killer is somehow in the circus as a performer . This makes knife-thrower Mario the number one suspect .

568104	2721657	120302	6.0	Panic Attack	( There Are Spoilers ) At the start of the movie " Tell Me No Secrets " L . A assistant D . A Jess Koster , Lorie Loughlin , is being stalked by this creepy looking guy at the L . A district court garage . Later we learn that the guy terrorizing Jess is non-other then Sean Ferguson , Tracy Walter , who she's to prosecute for the rape and battery of his former girlfriend Connie Ching , Lauren Tom . The movie gets even more dicey when it turns out that the lawyer defending Ferguson is Jess ' former husband Don Shaw , Bruce Greenwald , now how's that for a courtroom drama . Jess had a nervous breakdown four years ago when her mom Pearl Koster , Michole Mercurio , walked out of the house and was never seen again . Recovering from her breakdown Jess passed the bar and got a job at the L . A district attorneys office as an assistant prosecutor which didn't help her mental condition by dealing with the dregs of society . This lead to her having panic-attacks especially when she lost a case . The case she has against Ferfuson is taxing her more then usual with the viciousness of the crime and her former husband defending him her clients , Connie's , attacker . Connie then all of a sudden changes her mind not to testify against Ferguson , like she told Jess that she would , because he threatened to murder her if she did and there would be no one to take care of her six year-old son Lewis with her gone . Jess get's Connie to agree to go on the stand promising her police protection from Ferguson but later Connie goes missing and is found viciously murdered with Ferguson the main suspect . All of a sudden Jess feels that she owes it to Connie to have Ferguson put away for life since all the evidence points to him but her husband Don gets him off on a technicality , no fingerprints on the murder weapon a piece of piano wire . This almost leads Jess to have another breakdown . Eariler Jess ran into Adam Stiles , Joe Flanigan , at the courtroom who was there as a spectator and later going to buy a new pair of shoes finds him working at the store and slowly starts to fall in love with him . I for one wondered just what Adam's role in the movie was since he had nothing at all , except being Jess ' love interest , to do with what was happening in the film . Adam , who turned out be an ex-lawyer , at first came across as creepy as Ferguson with a really weird foot faddish that he used to pick up pretty girls , like Jess . It even looked for a time that he was really the person who was sending Jess sick and threatening letters , who she thought were sent by Ferguson , that was driving her to the point of insanity . The film " Tell Me No Secrets " slowly links Jess ' missing mom to what was happening to her now and the ending is truly shocking but at the same time not very convincing . It not only exposes who killed her mom , Jess finds out that she was in fact murdered , but who set up Jess to lose the case against Fergurson knowing that he's guilty of murder but planning to be his judge jury and executioner all at the same time .

The Sheriff also likes to work over helpless prisoners in getting them to confess to crimes that they didn't commit . It's when Sheriff Ward starts to put the screws on Annie , in trying to get her to go to bed with him , that she goes over his head with a sexual harassment suit that she files against him .

You know right away as soon as you see him that Sheriff Ward is a bit off center with him always wearing heavily bleached dungarees instead of the police issued pants that all the police in his department wear .

Later when Sheriff Ward catches Thompson stealing some of his sht he has no trouble smashing his skull in with his flashlight killing him . This mindless act on Sheriff Ward's part brought the FBI , who were watching him for months , into the mix and had Annie stick her neck out , with an undercover wire , to finally catch the bum . Actually Sheriff Ward's sexual harassment of both Annie and Patty , who later dropped all the charges against him , would never have gotten anywhere with him being an upstanding citizen and happily married , with his wife never being seen at all in the film , man . It was his illegal drug pushing or dealing , as well as arrogance , not his inflamed and overactive libido that in the end did Sheriff Ward in where he ended up being the one getting screwed instead of his female victims .

This is what happens in " The Secret Fury " with poor Ellen being driven insane and into a mental institution hopefully , in the mind of the person who's driving Ellen mad , for the rest of her life . The real murderous psychotic in the movie is someone who no one , especially Ellen , would ever suspect and his reasons for doing these terrible things to Ellen are even more insane that he is ! The killer made one big mistake in his subconscious and innocent quirks that are at first totally overlooked by everyone , including Ellen , in the film . It just happened that as Ellen became more and more psychotic , or paranoid , her subconscious mind picked up these quirks and putting two and two together she soon realized who the person is . Getting the jump on Ellen the killer , who also picked up Ellen picking up his very unusual mannerisms , quickly goes into attack mode revealing the real reason for his actions , cold blooded and naked revenge , but not for what she but her late father did to him .

Setting a trap for Nazi spy Raush , Charles Wegweheim , on the SF waterfront Raush evades Charlie and his partner NYPD Capt . Flynn , Robert Homans , only to end up murdered by one of his fellow spies . Raush had to be silenced because he knew too much and was about to be caught and made to talk by Charlie & Co . Getting the license plate number of the getaway car with the person who murdered Raush driving leads Charlie together with his # 3 son Tommy , Benson Fong , and Charlie's chauffeur and Tommy's sidekick Birmingham Brown , Mantan Moreland , to the Cosmon Radio Center . It turns out that the getaway car belonged to radio actress Diane Hall , Helen Deverell , who reported it stolen earlier that evening . It also turned out that Raush's killer is one of the people working at the radio studio ! With him leaving his bloody footprint-thus the title of the movie " The Scarlet Clue " - there the same footprint , and shoe size , that he left at the murder scene . From this point on the killer knowing that Charlie is zeroing in on him , in working at the radio studio , starts to murder anyone who can implicate him in Raush's murder as well as being a top Nazi spy . Even those Nazi spies that he's in charge of ! Typical Charlie Chan movie with # 3 son Tommy gumming up the machinery in him trying to show that he's as good a detective as his Papa Charlie is . Mantan Moreland's Birmingham Brown is by far best thing going for the movie stealing every scene that he's in . Moreland's hysterical quick and witty dialog keeps the audience entertained when the film starts to lag , with a number of confusing sub-plots thrown in , in the second half . There's also Morelands good friend , in real life , Ben Carter who makes a guest appearance in the film as , who else , Ben Carter . The two , Moreland & Carter , go into this routine where they never finish a sentence as if they were reading each others minds . This drives # 3 son Tommy almost to drink in trying to figure out just what the two are talking about ! Charlie himself comes across as if he's suffering from a severe case of sleep deprivation talking in an , more then usual for him , mechanical-like monotone voice throughout most of the film . If you didn't know any better you would think that Charlie was either under hypnosis or just plain tired , Sidney Toland made a record 5 Charlie Chan movies that year , or overworked . In the end Charlie got his man-The Nazi spy master-with the same trap that he set for Charlie # 3 son Tommy and Birmingham Brown earlier in the film . It just goes to show how ineffective the head Nazi spy and his bumbling cohorts were in that he , as well as them , not only couldn't steal the secret radar plans from the US Government but were totally ignorant to what deadly traps they , in trying to off Charlie & Co . , set up in he Cosmo Radio Center as well .

568403	2721657	31259	6.0	From now on Joe Bell runs the other way	SPOILERS John Garfield's electrifying yet touching performance as fugitive from he law Joe Bell lifts this very convoluted and predictable movie about a man with a chip on his shoulder to where it gets to you no matter how corny and dated it is . Sent up the river for 16 months for a crime he didn't commit Joe Bell is released when the real criminal was arrested for another crime and confessed to the one that Joe was convicted off . Bitter at society for the raw deal it gave him Joe spends the rest of the movie getting into trouble , from being arrested as a vagrant to being on the run for a murder , with a number of total strangers coming to his aid . The strangers help the confused and quick-tempered young man out despite jeopardizing their own safety and freedom in doing it . First there's the old railroad break-man Pop , Charlie Grapewin , who let Joe and two of his hobo friends the Glenn brothers Hank & Jimmy , Bill Holap & Bobby Jordan , stay in a box-cart when he should have had them arrested . Later Joe hungry and desperate needing , together with his newlywed wife Mable ( Priscilla Lane ) , a bite to eat meets kindly grocery store owner , Ferike Boros . Ferike offers Joe food for free seeing that the young man didn't have a dime on him . This act of kindness has the both guilt-ridden and embarrassed Joe walks out of the store , forgetting about his plans to rob it . and not take up Freike's offer for a free meal . On the run and always a step ahead of the police Joe and Mable , who's step-father Charlie Garreth ( Stanley Ridge ) was the boss of the work farm whom Joe accidentally killed , end up in a small town where Joe finally lands a job that can make him a productive citizen . Joe becomes a photojournalist when he accidentally snapped a number of photos of a bank robbery that later resulted in the capture of the robbers .

His boss newspaper editor Mike Leonard , Alan Hale , hearing Joe out about his past misfortunes with the law takes the credit himself for the photos , to keep Joe from having his face plastered all over the papers . This has Mike end up almost being kidnapped by the hoods who robbed the bank . Joe seeing that Mike is about to be kidnapped and possibly murdered runs to his aid and not only saves his life but ends up getting all the unwanted publicity that he tried to avoid . Not all that predictable of an ending " Dust be my Destiny " has all the people who helped Joe throughout the movie come to his defense . This leads the jury to find Joe innocent of the murder of Charlie Garreth due to extenuating circumstances . The bitter young man in the end learned that the world , and the deck of cards it dealt him , wasn't against him and having a persecution complex would only makes things more difficult not easy for the combative Joe Bell . Made in 1939 " Dust be my Destiny " is not as corny and dated as you would have at first thought . John Garfield as well as Priscilla Lane's performances don't come across looking phony at all and . Their attempt to live honest and decent lives in spite of being on the lamb shows that , at least with John Garfield's Joe Bell , whatever miscarriage of justice that they were victim of it didn't drive the two to forsake the law and choose a life of crime .

Gripping as well as interesting movie with a great ending sequence where good overcomes evil despite the overwhelming odds against it .

568890	2721657	118955	6.0	A long time ago we set some boundaries ; Don't cross them !	SPOILERS The life that the Chadways lived was anything but normal . The head of the house real estate developer Clay Chadway , Richard Crenna , seemed to take the abuse he suffered from his jealous and neurotic wife Renee , Angie Dickinson , all in stride forgiving her for every crazy and unfounded accusation that she threw at him . With the exception of Joanne , Molly Gross , Clay treated his children as if they were total strangers to him . Clay drove his son Bobby , Jeff Kizer , to become a virtual shut-in and older daughter Lisa , Christe Lynn Smith , to rarely stay at home spending most of her time , from work at the beauty salon , staying with her friends . It was when Clay was spotted by Renee at a local restaurant with her sister Ellen , Meg Foster , that all the secrets that he's been keeping from his children as well as himself came to the surface ! As if by accident Renee's suspicions of Clay having a relationship with Ellen brought out the truth about her and the circumstance of Renee's marriage to Clay . Circumstance that were too shocking for anyone , even Clay Chadway , to even try to describe ! Trying to put on an act as the caring husband and father Clay's fantasy world was soon to come crashing down on him . It was Clay's wife Renee's unfounded accusations against him that in the end had him finally lose it . Not that Clay wasn't somewhat responsible for his unfeeling treatment of his son Bobby and daughter Lisa , for some reason that would soon come out he didn't feel the same way about Joanne , he in fact was far more innocent of the acts that Renee accused him of then she was ! SPOILERIt was on one cold rainy night when Renee pulled another one of her disappearing acts on him that the by now out of patience Clay finally lost his cool ! And that in the end cost him a lot more then what Renee ended up losing ! Even though he was the heavy in the movie Clay Chadway , or Richard Crenna , was by far the most sympathetic character in the film . Clay did everything that he could to hold his both marriage and family together but the ghosts from his , and Renee's , past were just too much for him to overcome . It was in fact Renee's guilt , not Clay's , that was far more responsible for all the horrors that she suffered in life in trying to keep her past buried . P . S Look for an almost microscopic cameo appearance , and try to keep from blinking in order not to miss it , of actor Tony Musante as Mr . Lennox the Chadway family attorney . Musante's as the accused gay murderer in " The Detective " and the knife wielding subway psycho in " the Incident " , both films made within a year of each other , were two ground breaking roles that finally put stark and shocking realism into movies coming out of the then " World of make Believe " Hollywood studios .

This all starts after Frank's father , a night watchman , was murdered in the robbery of the warehouse that he was guarding , with the police knowing that it was the Hendricks mob who committed the murder but not having any evidence to arrest or convict them . Frank going all over town trying to find and join the Hendricks mob runs into to it and it's leader Alex Hendricks , Edwin Nelson . That happened when he gets into a fight in a bar after breaking the concentration of a bar patron playing a pinball like bowling game . Impressed by Frank's ability to use his fists Hendricks offers him to join his mob . Even after Frank joined he was set up in a failed robbery of a gas station to see how he'll react under pressure , Frank passed with flying colors . Hendricks seems out of place with these 1950's teenage or early 20's greasers who he was using to do jobs for him all over town by breaking into warehouses and homes , even with those who lived there asleep , and stealing everything that wasn't tied or nailed down . Raymond , Tony Miller , Hendricks # 2 man who did all the dirty for the gang and who killed Frank's father was getting very jealous of Frank because his boss Hendricks was getting to like the up and coming young hoodlum . Raymond felt that he'll be replaced as the # 2 man in the Hendrick mob by Frank . This jealousy on Raymond's part had unknowingly uncovered the fact that Frank was working undercover for the police . Frank , knowing this , is very careful in tipping off the cops when the Hendricks mob was going to pull a new job and found a way to do it without Hendricks and Raymond knowing about it by leaving massages on matchbooks . With the police setting up a trap for the Hendricks mob at a warehouse after they were tipped off by Frank the entire Hendricks mobs gets arrested but Hendricks and Raymond and Frank get away in Hendricks white T-bird . With Frank's cover blown during the robbery the three are now back to the Hendricks bar hideout . With Frank tied up and Hendricks thinking that Raymond is outside looking out for the police he tells Frank that after Raymond knocks him off he'll have him turned over to the police in order to save the one and only one worth saving in this whole movie as well as the world HIM . Raymond who just happened to come into the bar and hearing that Hendricks is going to double-cross and sell him out to the cops goes wacko and beats Hendricks to death with a pool stick that he plunges right through his body . Running out of the bar Raymond is shot and killed by the cops as he pulls a knife on them . Even though the movie " The T-Bird Gang " has a very predictable story and the acting is adequate it did have it's moments and some scenes where very , if not original , innovative . I especially liked Hendricks girlfriend Marla , Pat George , who at first came across as a typical dumb blond but as the movie went on you realized that she was the smartest person in the film . Marla read classical novels like they were comic books and beat the smart and obviously very educated Hendricks in chess every time she played him .

568761	2721657	81563	6.0	Canadian Police Drama	Contains Spoiler ! ! ! Just to see Paul Williams , Julius Kurtz , playing a big time city pimp should make " Stone Cold Dead " worth watching . With the always reliable Richard Crenna , Sgt . Boyd as the Toronto cop with an obsession for putting Kurtz away and off the streets to make the city safe . Some deranged sniper has been offing prostitutes and at the same time photographing them and sending the photos to the police to taunt them and make them feel helpless in catching him . Sgt . Boyd thinks that it's Kurtz that's the killer and is out to get the goods on him . You would wonder why Kurtz would kill his own employees and hurt his prostitution business ? Does Boyd know something ? Fairly good whodunit with a surprising performance on the part of Paul Williams as the cool pimp with a heart of gold when it comes to taking good care of his " ladies " even though he can be rough some times but as everyone watching the movie knows Julie doesn't really mean it . A very effective and sympathetic scene in the film is when Kurtz is at a funeral of one of his murdered " ladies " and Sgt . Boyd arrives uninvited hassling him . Kurtz then quietly tell him " Can't you see that I'm here to pay my respects " . It just made me wonder who was the good guy and who was the bad guy in the movie . Sgt . Boyd gets really involved in the murder case when one of the hookers murdered by the sniper turns out to be a woman undercover detective who's also a good friend of his and it all becomes very personal with him . The ending of the movie is made to shock and surprise and it does very convincingly with the audience not seeing it coming . " Stone Cold Dead " has that rough and gritty look to it more because of it's small budget then it's filmmakers artistic talents in movie realism with better then average acting from it's supporting cast of Linda Sorenson , Monica Page , and Alberta Watson , Olivia Page , then you would usually see in a B-Movie .

Willis says a number of abracadabra on the bones and then poof , after Wills turned his back on them , up from the abyss there emerged the notorious and utterly evil Blacula , William Marshall . Blacula wastes no time in sticking his fangs in Willis ' neck not only turning him into a Vampire but making him , as well as a number of other people during the course of the movie , into his slave .

The ending has Blacula do a number on the LAPD and when he's about to finish Justin off Lisa , who's been screaming hysterically throughout the entire scene , sticks a wooden stake into the Voodoo Doll that she made of Blacula . Like the movie title says Blacula , after his Voodoo Doll is pierced , screams and screams sounding as if he was imitating the yodel that Johnny Weissmuler made famous in his many Tarzan movies . William Marshall undoubtedly is the glue that holds the movie " Scream Blacula Scream " together . Towering over everyone in the film , at six foot five inches , Marshall was as good as and effective a Dracula , or Blacula , as anyone who played the legendary Vampire in the past . Marshell's acting was also notches above the caliber of acting that you would have expected in the usual 1970's black-exploitation movies sounding and coming across like a black version of Gregory Peck .

And on top of all that the mystery man Murray Trevor , Julian Richings , didn't seem to age a day ! You can just imagine what Tom thought when he spotted this same Murray Trevor on his flight from Chicago to Washington D . C ! He just knew that something terrible was about to happen and , on a hunch , then prevented it from happening : A major mid-air collision that was to take the lives of over 300 people ! As he soon finds out Tom by preventing the collision from happening change the course of future event that resulted in the destruction , by someone on the plane surviving , of all of Southern California ! What's even more shocking is that Tom himself was supposed to have been killed in a major warehouse fire some time ago but it was Trevor , who was there to enjoy the action , who accidentally prevented that from happening !

Two of them being Tom's ex-wife Jen , Deborah Odell , and nine year old son Kevin , Marc Donato ! You just got to take things as they come , and not seriously , in " Thrill Seekers " knowing that with everything out of whack , in the time space continuum , you can't expect any logic in what's happening on screen . You do get an eyeful of top flight , for a made for TV movie , action scenes as well as people getting killed and , because of the time travel aspect of the film , coming back to life which more then makes up for the films hooky storyline . You also get an eyeful of actress Catherine Bell who when she lets her hair down and takes off her glasses , as well as puts on a tight fitting sweater , rivals the fiery action scenes , which she's soon to become a part of , in the film .

568767	2721657	47898	7.0	Bela's last real movie role and he made it count	SPOILERS Strange things have been happening around the Old Willow's place where a number of people have disappeared with the local police baffled about what happened to them . Janet Lawton , Loretta King , a local reporter has been writing stories about the disappearances and blaming them on what she calls " The Monster of Lake Marsh " which is getting people in the area very apprehensive and scared and making the police look helpless . It turns out very early in the movie we're shown that a Dr . Eric Vornoff , Bela Lugosi , with the help of his hulking assistant Lobo , Tor Johnson , have been kidnapping people in the woods around Lake Marsh and using them in experiments . The trouble is that Dr . Vornoff's experiments haven't been working out like he planned them to with those who he's experimenting on ending up dead . One afternoon at the local police station a prof . Strowski , George Becwar , shows up claiming that he's an expert on undiscovered monsters and thinks that whoever solve the mystery about the " Monster of Lake Marsh " . Telling police Captain Robbins , Harvey B . Dunn , and his second in command Lt . Dick Craig , Tony McCoy , to meet him the next morning and go out in the Lake Marsh area looking for the monster Strowski for some mysterious reason never shows up ! Strowski instead checks out the Old Willow's Place where he comes face to face with Dr . Vornoff . It turns out that both Dr . Vornoff and prof . Strowski worked in , for some strange reason the country is never mentioned in the movie , the Soviet Union Back in the USSR Dr . Vornoff came up with a plan to create beings out of atomic energy that would be indestructible and use them to conquer the world for the USSR . The Soviet Government feeling that Dr . Vornoff was mad and ran him out of the country . Now it seems that they realized that Dr . Vornoff was on to something big and they want him back so they sent Strowski to the USA to fetch him and bring him " home " . Dr . Vornoff feeling insulted and condescended too instead tells Strowski to get lost that his plans for an army of atomic supermen is for his own purposes not for any country much less the Soviet Union who threw him out and stripped him of all his honors and accomplishments . It's then when Strowski pulls out a gun and tells Vornoff that his government ordered him to bring him back . Lobo sneaks up on Strowski and grabs him from behind then throws him into a water tank where he's killed by a giant octopus . Meanwhile Janet , who's Lt . Craig's girlfriend is also snooping around the Old Willow's place looking to break the big story about the monster . Being attacked by a python Lobo comes to Janet's rescue and takes her back to Dr . Vornoff . Dr . Vornoff sees in Janet a new subject for him to try out his atomic experiments with but is interrupted when Lt . Craig , who went out looking for Strowski at the Old Willow's Place , bursts in before Dr . Vornoff can do his dirty work . Lt . Craig like it was with Strowski is grabbed from behind by Lobo who subdues him . With Lt . Craig chained to the wall Dr . Vornoff goes on with his experiments on Janet . Lobo who has taken a liking to Janet then attacks Vornoff and stops him from pulling the switch . Strapping Vornoff to the operating table Lobo turns the juice on him but unlike the other times when the experiment failed and the persons died this time it worked ! Vornoff turns into an atomic superman and clobbers Lobo and takes off with Janet in the woods with the whole police force hot on his heels . Vornoff after being forced to releases Janet , after Lt . Craig rolled a bolder on him , falls into a pound where he's attacked by the octopus that killed Strowski . While Vornoff and the the octopus are engaged in a life and death struggle their hit by a lighting bolt ! With what seems like the whole movie set goes up in a nuclear explosion with Captain Robbins , who was in charge of the police , ends the film by saying what has now become folk lore in movie history : " He Tampered in God's Domain " . " Bride of the Monster " was Bela Lugosi's last staring role and Bela gave it all that he had with the Mad Scientist bit which has to rank right up there with the best films that he made over his long movie career including " Dracula " and " Son of Frankenstein " as well as " Ninotchka " . Bela's " I Have'a no Home " speech that he gave to prof . Strowski was as good as anything that you would hear in an Academy Award winning film or top flight Shakesperaean production . Tor Johnson was also very effective as Lobo , even though he never uttered a word in the movie , by showing pain and affection for Janet who he tried to save from Dr . Vornoff's evil clutches and both Tony McCoy and Loretta King did have chemistry in the scenes that they were in together . George Becwar was more then adequate as the cagey and obsessed prof . Strowski trying to get Dr . Vornoff back home , to the USSR , to help in their nuclear research . You can say that the movie was awful only because director Ed Wood didn't have the money to make it more extravagant . Ed had to relay on cheap sets and props and in some places in the film add in stock footage . Yet I wounder how many top directors in the film business today or in 1955 when " Bride of the Monster " was made would have done better then Wood did with what he had . People should think of that before they put Ed Wood's " Bride of the Monster " down .

568436	2721657	85366	7.0	The Apartment	SPOILERS " Copkiller " or " Corrupt " does it's best to mix police corruption with a string of killing of " dirty cops " , who work for the plain clothes narcotic division of the NYPD , and comes out a bit uneven in the end . Narcotic plain clothes policemen are being murdered in New York City by this serial killer who dresses as a NYC policemen wearing a ski mask . The masked psycho kills the cops by slashing their throats with a long serrated knife . On the scene of one of the killers victims he left a phony police badge . While all this is going on we see NYC police Let . Fred O'Connor , Harvey Keitle , who's on " the take " with his partner police officer Bob Carvo , Leonard Mann , and who , together with Carvo , is living a double life . The two cops masquerade around as high living drug dealers at a $400 , 000 . 00 apartment overlooking Central Park . Everythings going well for the two plain clothes policeman until one afternoon when this weirdo Leo Smith , John Lydon , shows up at their apartment unannounced . O'Connor at first doesn't know what to make of this oddball since he feels that he somehow has " the goods " on him in his illegal drug dealings , together with his partner . How else could Leo have known about his and Carvo's secret apartment and the double lives that they lead ? Later on Let . O'Connor finds out that Leo comes from a very rich family who live in the town of Rhiencliff in upstate New York and is being looked for , as a missing person , by the entire police departments in both NYC & Rheincliff . Having him locked up in his apartment O'Connor goes up to Rhiencliff to see Leo's grandmother Margaret Smith , Silvia Sidney , on official business ; pretending that he's on the case to find her missing grandson . O'Conner also find an audio tape that Leo left there implicating him and his partner as corrupt cops . O'Connor feels that Leo , who told him about the tape in the first place , must have made other tapes as insurance to keep O'Connor from murdering him and making him disappear . The film then takes a turn where it's Leo not O'Connor who seems to be in control of the situation with O'Connor trapped in his own world of corruption and feeling that Leo had this planned all along . Later in an heated exchange between O'Connor and his partner Carvo at the apartment , over his treatment and confinement of Leo , O'Connor accidentally kills him and with Leo's help makes it look like Carvo was the victim of the police serial killer to throw the police off his trail . The movie starts getting even weirder when Leo tries to get O'Connor to murder Carvo's wife Lenore ( Nicole Garcia ) . Both Leo and O'Connor feel that Lenore had found about her husband and Let . O'Connor's corrupt activities and make their murdering her look like she killed herself . By now O'Connor is a totally destroyed man knowing that he was somehow manipulated by the clever Leo from the start . It's only a matter of time before the law , that he was sworn to uphold and enforce , will catch up with him and bring him before the bar of justice . It was both Harvey Keitel and John Lydon's performances that made the film " Copkiller aka Corrupt " well worth watching . The cat-and-mouse game between the manipulator and manipulated kept you glued to the screen until the ending credits and made you overlook the films many faults and inconsistencies .

A few days later the Snowbeast stuck right in the heart of lodge itself killing and wounding a number of people and putting everyone at the lodge in a state of panic . With nothing left to keep the people at the lodge from knowing about the dangerous Snowbeast Tony and his friend and new employee Gar go up into the woods and mountain slopes to put an end to what's responsible for all this death and destruction . O . K movie about a not-too-friendly Bigfoot on the rampage with some very good ski and outdoor photography . There's also a nice sub-plot about Gar's fears and anxieties about being another washed-up Olympic Gold Medal winner . With nothing to look forward to in the future and of course , to those of us watching and rooting for Gar to come through in the movie , more then making up for his unfounded fears in the end . It was also good to see Clint Walker , Sheriff Paraday , the epitome of the " Strong & Silent Type " who really didn't have that much to do , or say , in the movie in that he was killed off before the big final ending scene . But when Walker did say something the movie cast , as well as the audience , would stop look and listen . There were also good performances by Yvette Mimieux as Gar's TV reporter wife and Silvia Sidney as Tony's grandmother and owner of the Nill Lodge . The Snowbeast was given very little screen time but was always on everyones mind which made it more dangerous and effective then having it over-exposed until he became an eyesore to watch . Hard sliding ending put the Snowbeast on the skids for good and saved the day for everyone still alive in the movie .

SPOILERS Made on a shoe-string budget " Countdown " is by far the movie with the best depiction of a flight to the Lunar surface then any of the previous " Flight to the Moon " films going as far back as the early 1900's . The movie went from science fiction to science fact in just under two years after it's release in early 1968 with the historic three manned Apollo 11 Moon landing on July 20 , 1969 . Trying to become the first nation to put a man on the Moon the US has NASA set a mission to the Lunar surface to beat the USSR . It's supposed to be done with the astronaut sated for that historic mission to be a civilian . Air Force fighter pilot Chiz Stewart , Robert Duvall , who was hoping to be chosen for the Moon Mission is terribly upset by being eliminated because of his military background . Stewart become very hostile towards his friend Lee Stegler , James Caan , a civilian worker for NASA for getting picked for the flight christened , or designated by NASA , Pilgrim One . Taking out his frustrations on Lee Chiz , who's in charge of training for the Moon Mission , does everything he can to have him wash out of the program . Not just because of sour grapes but because Chiz like Lee's wife Mckey , Joanna Cook Moore , feel that he's doesn't have the experience as an astronaut to handle this very dangerous assignment . On top of that Lee , being the egomaniac that he is , will end up getting himself killed on the mission because of his obsession the be the first man on the moon even if it kills him . Just days before Lee is to blast off there's news from the Soviet Union that the Russians sent a three man crew into obit and that it would land on the Moon before the USA planned Moon shot . That still doesn't have Pilgrim One suspended with those at NASA feeling that the news may very well be a rumor . To keep them form launching the Moon Mission , by the sneaky and conniving Soviets . Sent into space the next morning from Cape Kennedy in Florida Pilgrim One has major problems as it goes into the Moons trajectory because of a power loss during the take-off . With Chiz , at the controls at the NASA Space Center in Huston , walking Lee through the dangerous complexities of the space mission he makes it to within 200 miles from the surface of the Moon . On the Moon NASA had two weeks earlier landed and unmanned space shelter with a rotating red beacon that Lee is to first identify and then to land , as close as possible , next to it . At the shelter there's enough air water and food to last two months . It's then when NASA would send an Apollo manned space capsule to pick up Lee and bring him back safely home to earth . It turned out that Chiz and Mickey's worse fears were realized with Lee not wanting to have the mission aborted and sent back to earth , without being the first man on the Moon , taking his chances in landing Pilgrim One despite not really knowing if it was withing site of the NASA shelter . Which , with only two hours of air in his space suit , was almost curtain death for him . Walking through the unknown wilderness that's the Lunar surface Lee discovers that the USSR indeed landed a manned space mission on the Moon before the USA . Lee also finds out that the three man crew were killed as it crashed , instead of landed , on impact . With the air in his space suit almost exhausted Lee looking at his watch , which told him that he had only seven minutes of oxygen left , notices a bilking red flash reflecting off the glass back at him ! Looking straight ahead Lee sees the NASA space shelter , which was Lee's only chance of surviving , with it's red rotating identification lamp guiding him straight to it .

In the movie " Quicksand " Mickey Rooney not only plays a grown up but a bad guy as well . Only in that he was only guilty by reasons of circumstances . Picking up blond bombshell Vera , Jeanne Cagney , who was a cashier at the diner that Dan Brady , Mickey Rooney , was with his co-workers having a snack Dan gets into a load of trouble that started with him stealing $20 . 00 from the till at his job as a car mechanic to take Vera out on a date . That later leads to him mugging bingo game owner Shorty , Sidney Marion , of his profits then getting blackmailed by Vera's former boss arcade owner Nick , Peter Lorre . Who had evidence that Dan mugged Shorty which leads Dan to steal a new car from his job and give it to have Nickh keep his mouth shut . Dan later is caught by his boss Mr . Mackey , Art Smith , when he suckered him into admitting that he stole the new car by telling him that he knew that he did it , which he didn't . Which Mackey told everyone else at the job and only guilt-ridden Dan was dumb and guilty enough to fall for Mackey's trick and say that he in fact did . With Vera's help Dan breaks into Nick's office and steals $3 , 600 . 00 from his weekly take only to have Vera spend half of it on a mink coat . This when he needed $3 , 000 . 00 to pay Mackey off to have him not report him to the police . Coming up with the remaining $1 , 800 . 00 wasn't enough for Mackey and as he was about to call the police on Dan he attacked him and knocked him out but thought that he murdered him . Going back to Vera's place Dan sees the cops there and hides on the fire escape only to hear that Vera is about to sell him out to save her neck . Running into his true blue girlfriend Helen , Barbara Bates , Dan then gets her into a heap of trouble by having Helen help him carjack a motorist so that they can both drive across the border into Mexico . It's then that Dan & Helen find out that their kidnap victim is a lawyer who tells Dan that he can be charged with a capital crime for what he just did by kidnapping him . Even though Dan at the time thought that he'll hang for killing Mr . Mackey who unknowing to him survived . It ' then that Dan's kidnap victim offers to help both him and Helen if he lets him go free which Dan does at the end of the movie . It's just then that Dan gets into a shootout with the police at the shipyard as he tries to escape by sea and is shot and captured . Helen ends up getting off the hook and Dan is told by his new found friend , the former kidnapped lawyer , that he can get no more then one year behind bars tops in the can since he's a first-time offender . Being the lovable Mickey Rooney in real life didn't hurt Dan's chances either . Now thats really being an adult in the movies . " Quicksand " is one of Mickey Rooney's best adult movies and it would have been much better if only the ending wasn't so contrived and unbelievable by having Dan get off practically scott free . After committing a string of crimes that would have put anyone else , if they weren't adorable Mickey Rooney , away for life if not on death row . I almost expected at the end of the film for Mickey and his girlfriend as well as his lawyer friend to break out in some song and dance act with the entire cast in the movie , including a number of chorus girls , joining in .

A . This ghastly and dastardly act was accomplished by that murderous sleaze-ball Kim with the help of illegal black-market poisonous snake smuggler Kraitler , Darron Moore . Kim's gang got the deadly serpents on the plane in wooden crates who , by the snakes being old blooded , weren't picked up by the heat sensors at the airport terminal .

Flynn seemed to be immune to the snakes and their fangs as if he was wearing protective clothing not getting sung once despite him slugging it out with the vipers for almost an hour on the plane . A good half of the people on board weren't as lucky as Agent Flynn getting stung and in one case crushed to death as well as swallowed whole by a 25 foot non-poisonous constrictor . Some of the most terrifying scenes in the movie happened in the plane's restrooms with a horny couple getting attacked and killed by the snakes who caught them in the most intimate of circumstances and positions . there's also the poor man who was about to relive himself who has a viper attack him and grab him by his private parts as he slowly , due to the snake bite , lost consciousness and died . SPOILER ALERT One the most touching and courageous scenes in the movie has to do with senior , or head , stewardess Grace , Lin Shayn , who passed up an early retirement offer in order to take flight 121 back home to L . A . By doing that Grace unknowingly ended up becoming one of the hero's , together with Agent Flynn , on board by saving an infant from getting stung to death by a hoard of deadly vipers but at the cost of her own life .

Epic motion picture about the life times and loves of the immortal Irish patriot Charles Stewart Parnell , Clark Gable , who fought for Irish independence and home rule from the hated and oppressive British Empire . In the end Parnell succumb not to British power bullets or gallows or even his fellow Irishmens infighting but to the woman that he loved Mrs . Katie O'Shea , Myrna Loy . It was Katie's social climbing husband Captain Willie , Alan Marshal , who exposed his love affair with his wife Katie in order to get back at him . Parnell was a man who never turned away from a good fight and his career in Irish / British politics was filled with battles that he both fought and won against almost unbelievable odds . Yet when it came to defend himself in the divorce trial of his love Katie O'Shea he just refused to stand up and fight like a man for her and his honor . Katie's husband Willie never loved her and just kept her around , not giving her the divorce that she begged him for , for only political reasons and nothing else . Coming back to his beloved Ireland after visiting his mother in the United States Parnell is quickly caught up in the vicious and cold-hearted attempt by the British to drive tens of thousands of Irish families out of their homes and farms in a major land-grab on their part . Being himself arrested for inciting violence , which was a bald-faced lie on the part of the British government , Parnell in fact called on his fellow Irishmen to refrain from violence and fight their brutal British overlords with the power of the vote instead . Being framed for the infamous May 6 , 1882 Dublin Phoenix Park murders of British foreign secretary Fredrick Cavendish and his aid T . H Burke , Parnell stood on trial for his life and forced the issue when he got the Irish editor Richard Piggot , Neil Fitzgerald , to admit that he forged the letters supposedly written by the Innocent Parnell taking credit for the two British diplomats murders . Exposed on the stand as both a liar and a fraud a shaken Piggot asks to be excused so he can go outside the courtroom for some air and then proceeds to blow his brains out . Parnell now on the verge of his greatest and most sought after political victory , Irish autonomy and independence , is back-stabbed by his lovers , Kate O'Shea's , scheming husband Willie who exposes his affair with his wife by suing Katie for divorce . Refusing to defend himself feeling that his , and Katie's , personal life is nobody's business Parnell is then about to be thrown out of the newly formed Irish Parliament that he , more then anyone else , was responsible from being brought into existence in the first place . With a lifetime of battles under his belt Parnell's decision to turn away from this one the nasty and publicized O'Shea divorce lead him , by the vicious attacks on Katie and himself in the press , to suffer an emotional and physical collapses . In the end Parnell died from pneumonia on October 6 , 1891 at the very young age of 45 ; Parnell was married to Katie some six months at the time of his death . Nowhere as bad as it's critics said it was back in 1937 " Parnell " gives a very accurate description of one of Ireland's most beloved sons and charismatic statesman and Clark Gable is very good in the role as the fiery but tragic Charles Stewart Parnell . The only thing that was bit too overdone in the film was Parnell's long and drawn out illness which could have been at least cut in half so the movie wouldn't have turned out to be a boring TV soap opera . Besides that " Parnell " is one of the best biographies to come out of Hollywood back then in the 1930's .

Mike going in first goes room to room trying to find Josh and finally realizes that the cries are coming from the basement and runs down there , just as the cries started they all of a sudden stop . Heather screaming for Mike and Josh to answer her also runs down to the basement and then all we see from her video camera is Mike standing in the corner looking into a blank wall , like the children who were killed at the old man Parr house some sixty years ago ! Terrified with fear we hear Heather give out an ear splitting cry and the camera falls out of her hand ! All we can see from what the video camera recorded is an empty ceiling ! Heather Mike and Josh were never seen or heard from again and all that was left of them was the video tapes that they made of their expedition in the woods that made up the movie " The Blair Witch Project " . " The Blair Witch Project " is a lot like the movies directed by the late Jacques Tourneur like " Cat People " in 1942 and " The Leopard Man " in 1943 and later " The Curse of the Demon " in 1957 . Tourneur used lights and sounds and shadows to scare the wits out of his audiences not special effects that were so used to seeing in horror movies now . The the film has over 3 , 000 IMDb users comment on it as well as taking in over $140 million in domestic ticket sales during it initial release in the summer of 1999 shows the tremendous effect that it had on those who saw it . These two facts , among many others , shows that " The Blair Witch Project " made an impact on the movie going public far bigger than many of it's detractors would like us to believe .

568506	2721657	68931	7.0	Charles Bronson Thriller with a wallop of an ending	Fascinating film about the life and lifestyle of a professional hit-man , a Mechanic , and how dangerous that lifestyle can be not just for the person that gets " Hit " but also for the " Hitman " himself . Arthur Bishop , Charles Bronson , is the top " Mechanic " in the business and we see in the beginning of the movie how he does his job . Getting his orders through the mail Bishop sets up his victim by casing out his hotel room and then planting an explosive in his bookcase and rigging his gas-range to leak slowly so he wouldn't notice . Then wait hidden , across the street facing his intended victim's room , until the time is right for him to get off a shot . Not at the victim but at the bookcase to make it look like the he died in a tragic accident instead of an assassins bullet . You see this all happening in the first fifteen minutes of the movie without a single word of dialog but it's done so well that you know exactly what's happening on the screen . The " hit job " that Bishop had at the start of the movie turned out to be a flaming success . One afternoon Bishop gets a call from a old friend " Big " Harry , Keenan Wynn . McKenna about some trouble he's having with the organization and if Bishop can help him out . Being that Bishop's father was one of the founders of the organization " Big " Harry feels he can get whatever trouble he has with it smooths out . Bishop tells " Big " Harry he'll see what he could do . The next morning Bishop gets an envelope in the mail from the organization for his next hit and the person Bishop is contracted to knock off is non other then " Big " Harry . Going through the motions as usual Bishop plans his " Hit " on " Big " Harry with cold calculations and no emotions at all even though he knew " Big " Harry since he was a little boy . Getting " Big " Harry to meet him in a secluded place by the beach Bishop takes a number of shot at him but not trying to kill him but to induce " Big " Harry to have a fatal heart attack which he does . This is doe by Bishop so that the police and maybe even his fellow mobsters wouldn't be suspicious of any foul play in " Big " Harry's death . " Big " Harry's son Steve , Jan-Michael Vincent who Bishop met when he came to see " Big " Harry begins to take a very strong liking to him after his fathers death . It's as if Steve wanted Bishop to be his fathers replacement . Even though at the time when Bishop saw Steve with his father they weren't exactly that close and Steve seemed to have a dislike and resentment for his dad even at his funeral that Bishop attended . It seems that Steve wants to become a " Mechanic " like Bishop and wants to learn the tools of the trade from him , who's the best in the business . Steve likes Bishop's pad in the country and fancy sports car and most of all the danger of his job that is very exciting for the young man who was bored with his life of unending parties . You start to wonder if thats really the reason Steve is so interested to be around Bishop ? Does Steve want to get even with Bishop , who Steve seems to know , killed his father ? And why does Bishop seem to be so agreeable with Steve in teaching him about the art of killing in secret ? Or is Bishop not as naive as he seems to be and is setting Steve up for something ? Intelligent film about the dirty business of the assassination game with Charles Bronson and Jan - Michael Vincent very good as cold-blooded killers who show no emotion at what they do . Slow in the action department , for a Charles Bronson movie , at first but better acted and written then most of the movies that he made back then in the 1970's . With an ending that's one of the best and most surprising finals you'll ever see in any movie .

In the movie Max tries to make it as a law-biding citizen after doing his latest stretch , six years , in the can for burglary with a deadly weapon . Reporting to his parole officer Earl Frank , M . Emmer Walsh , you could see just how honest Max was in trying to follow all the rules to make him a decent and productive member of society . First getting himself a room at a local hotel to live and then with the help of his new and somewhat naive girlfriend Jenny , Theresa Russell , who worked for an employment agency to get a job at a neighborhood can factory Max looked like he was on his way back to civilization . But like a bird flying south for the winter Max just couldn't stay away from his fellow criminals and ex-convicts and it was that compulsion that turned out to be his downfall in the movie . Getting in touch with friend and ex-con Willy Darin , Gary Busey , to talk over old times Willy , who does some carpentry , tells Max that he'll get him a bed-board for his bed at the hotel room that Max is staying at . After putting the board in Willy takes out a spoon and fills it with dope and lights a book of matches under it and then shoots up . Max glumly tells his friend that doing that in his room with him present can get him three years in jail if his parole officer ever found out about it . Max follows the same pattern throughout the movie ; He chooses the wrong friends and those friends cost him his freedom and turn him into a criminal and fugitive from the law . Even his caring girlfriend who I at first thought would have a very good effect on Max , by making him see the light and straightening him out for her sake as well as his , did nothing at all to make Max go legit . Jenny instead looked up to Max for being outside the law as some kind of hero as well as an adventure for her that she wanted to be part of . Jenny could have , if she didn't by the time the movie was over , ended up being behind bars herself for harboring a fugitive which Max himself told her that she was doing . After breaking his parole as well as his parole officers nose and leaving him stranded on a heavily traveled LA highway with his pants down Max had only two choices left to him : jail or crime and of course Max took the latter . It was interesting to see in the movie how Max's friend Willy came full circle by being responsible for Max breaking his parole at the start of the film and then having something to do with the death of Max's friend and partner in crime , in their short career as a armed robber , Jerry Schue , Harry Dean Stanton . Jerry was gunned down by the police at he end of the film by Willy leaving both Max and Jerry holding the bag as he sped away with the getaway car instead of waiting for them after they committed a jewelry heist . Even though you couldn't really blame Willy since Max was too greedy and kept Jerry in the jewelry store long enough for the police to respond and Willy had no choice but to drive away to save himself from getting caught due to Max's uncontrollable gluttony . Unable and unwilling to take responsibility for Jerry's death Max brutally murders Willy instead who did everything right in the jewel robbery . With the assaulting of his parole officer followed by a string of armed robberies and ending with the murder of Willy as well as the shooting death of his friend Jerry who was killed by the police because of Max's compulsive stupidity he also gets his innocent girlfriend Jenny to become a fugitive from the law . It was a diamond watch that Max promised Jenny that made him forget to leave on time from the jewelry store . In the end the thought by society of Max going straight from his crooked path turned out to be a twisted idea .

Checking the photos Saitta thinks that the necklace photo looks very familiar and sees that it's one of the photos given to him by Julie of Louise , also found on Terri was a key to what turned out to be a locker at a Montreal bus station . It's then when Capt . Saitta went to the bus depot , to check out what was in the locker , he finds that it contained the blue necklace that was on the photo . Capt Saitta starts to realize that the necklace may be the reason for his sister's death . Saitta meets Margi about Louise's tie-in with Terri , in regard to the necklace , and gets into an argument with her over her brother Terri about why his sister would get involved with someone " like him " . Margi , defending her brother tells Saitta that he shouldn't say anything bad about her dead brother when he knows so little about his sweet and innocent little sister Louise . Checking out all the leads about the mysterious blue necklace Saitta finds out that the necklace was stolen from a rich society woman , Mrs . Wilkerson , from Toronto who was savagely murdered some time ago . Saitta also finds that whoever had the necklace was trying to fence it off for a huge amount of cash but there were no takers the necklace was just too hot to handle ! So how did Louise come into possession of that necklace ? It now finally begins to dawn on Capt . Saitta that his sister was in some way involved in that murder in Toronto of Mrs . Wilkerson . Great thriller with a great and effective music score and top-notch acting from Stuart Whitman on down makes " Strange shadows in an empty room " head and shoulders above the many " Dirty Harry " imitations of it's day . In fact it has a much deeper plot and far less violence then the " Dirty Harry " films were noted for making it a much more effective film . With the exception of the exciting chase scene , there was a far better one later in the movie , and bank shoot-out at the beginning of the film I counted five deaths in the entire movie and that included Louise Saitta who was poisoned and another person who died of an apparent suicide off camera . What makes " Strange shadows in an empty room " so effective is that it not only makes you think while your watching the movie but also long after it's over .

568681	2721657	89853	8.0	All you have to do is Dream	SPOILERS Charming little depression era film set in New Jersey about a women who's only way of forgetting her drab hard and lonely life as a waitress and only breadwinner of her household . Who's husband Monk , Danny Alello , is a no good drunken bum who should know and appreciate how lucky he is to have such a sweet and caring women like Cecilia , Mia Farrow , for a wife . Trying to forget her troubles Cecilia spends her free time going to the neighborhood movie house , like millions of Americans did back then in the 1930's , to get lost in a dream of better times that are projected on the great sliver screen . Woody Allen and Mia Farrow were never better as a director and actress in this gem of a movie . The ending of the film , even though it's a bit downbeat , was just what the film needed when you realize that dreams are best kept to oneself and in their right place . Not to try to make them real since you'll only end up hurt and disenchanted as well as detached from the real world by thinking that they are . Mia Farrow is sweet and touching as Cecilia as she falls so madly in love with the character Tom Baxter , Jeff Daniels , of the movie " The Purple Rose of Cairo " . She goes to see the movie every night until Tom , noticing her , comes to life and jumps off the screen to the shock and surprise of Ceilia to wine and dine and start up a romance with her . Tom is charming but at the same time very naive about the real world . Since everything he knows about life is from the movie that he's in , which is G rated where everybody is both rich and happy , and not the hard truths about depression life in America . These realities confuse Tom since he never was in a movie like the world that he's in now . Tom doesn't know what a hooker is and when he's picked up by one who takes him to where she works , a bordello , Tom thinks he's at some social gathering with a number of well dolled up high class ladies . Tom is such a nice guy that when Cecilia " s husband Monk fights with him Tom after he knocks him down , with the old one two , offers Monk a hand to help him up ! Only to be kicked and punched for his noble effort . Meanwhile the actor who plays Tom Gil Shepherd tries to get Cecilia to get Tom back in the motion picture to finally end the movie so he can get back to his acting career . While back at the movie house the cast of the movie are just left stranded on the screen doing nothing and the audience is up in arms and wants their money back . In the end Tom , realizing that he's not meant to be in the real world , goes back into the film " The Purple Rose of Cairo " and when the movie is over so is Tom and Ceilia's romance . Ceilia find the truth out when she goes to the theater and sees a new movie on the screen and as we see the movie " Top Hat " Inter-cut with Cecilia and as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dance and sing " Cheek to Cheek " . Cecilia's eyes fill up with tears and then when she realizes that her romance with Tom was a dream but by being a dream , as short as it was , it will never be forgotten and will always be with her forever like the movies that she loves so much . Beautiful little movie that really tugs on your heart strings and chokes you up in the end that proves what the saying " Big gifts come in little packages " really mean .
568146	2721657	96216	8.0	I never was on the New Jersey !	SPOILERS Moments after TWA Flight 847 from Athens to Rome reached cruising level the plane was suddenly hijacked by two Arab fanatics Castro & Saiid , Eli Danker & Joseph Nasser . The two hijackers demand that some 700 suspected Arab terrorists held in Israeli jails be released or else they'll bring the plane , and it's 152 passengers and crew , down in the Mediterranean Sea by detonating a bunch of hand grenades that they have on them . The hijackers waste no time at all in brutalizing the passengers and crew and almost creating a panic . That in itself would have brought the passenger plane down without the use of explosives if it wasn't for the chief flight attendant on the plane Uli Derickson , Lindsey Wagner . Uli put herself between the hijackers in trying to keep both them and the terrified passengers from overreacting and causing the plane to tailspin and crash into the sea . The film " Flight 847 " shows the kind of courage that's so rare in most movies . In that we have Uli not only risking her life over and over again in order to keep both Castro & Saiid from bringing down the plane and killing everyone on it but trying , and with some success , to get the two desperate men to at least let a number of the passengers , women & children , on the plane go . Uli at one point refused to reveal which of the passengers , by the names on their passports , are either Isralie or Jewish . This action again had Uli risking her life knowing full well the fate that would be in store for them at the hands of the vindictive and hateful Arab hijackers ; Who's country Lebanon was bombed invaded and occupied by Israeli Army three years ago . It turned out that the person who got the worst of it among the passengers was US Navy man Robert Stethen , whom the film was dedicated to , played by Steven Eckholdt . Stethen was savagely beaten by the two hijackers so all throughout the film . Later at the Beirut Airport , battered and almost unconscious , he was shot to death and dumped out on the tarmac to show everyone , on and off the plane , that hijackers meant business . It turned out that the hatred that the two , especially Castro , had for poor Robert Stethen was that him being in the US Navy . Castro & Saiid held Stethen responsible for the bombardment of Beirut by the 16 inch guns of the US Navy's giant battleship the USS New Jersey that killed Castro's wife and infant daughter . It took all of Uli's skills as a negotiator as well as her unbelievably courage to keep all of the passengers and crew , with the exception of Robert Stethen , to get out of this hell , that turned out to be Flight 847 , alive . Even though a number were brutally beaten by the two hijackers but survived thus making the best of a very very bad situation . The hijackers were reinforced at Beirut by some dozen other members of their group and , finding out that the Israeli Army was about to air-dropped and storm the plane , had Flight 847 take off again and land in Algiers . It's there when the nightmare finally ended for Uli and the remaining 151 passengers and crew with the release of the head man of the hijack group Ali Atwa , Emile Beaucard . Atwa incidentally was apprehend before the hijacking ever took place by the Athens Airport security guards before he could ever get on the plane . One of , if not the only , few light moments in the movie was when after Uli sang a song , that both Castro & Saiid insisted on , to break the tension on the flight that Saiid was so moved by it that he asked her to marry him . Which to a shocked and surprised Uli , who was already married with a young son , would have been as bad , or even worse , then having her go down in flames together with Flight 847 in the middle of the Mediterranean . The movie " Flight 847 " didn't have the usual and predictable Hollywood happy ending with the calvary , or actors Chuck Norris & Lee Mavin , raiding to the rescue and taking out all the bad guys like in the fictitious but exciting version of Flight 847 in " The Delta Force " . It did have a true to life hero , or heroine , in the true story of a young woman who risked her life . She did that by standing down a plane full of desperate and suicidal hijackers and thus single-handedly saving the lives of practically all of the passengers and crew on board that she was responsible for without a shot , on her part , being fired . Which would be something that even the elite Delta Force couldn't do with all the state of the arts arms and unlimited supply of ammunition that they'ed have at their disposable .

To make things even worse Kanda has been hanging the dead hawks in front of white settlers homes . Obam trying to get his brother to see that violence will only beget violence later ends up seeing things his brother way instead . This happens when the government refused to give his people the right to vote with the exception of land owners ! Land which Obam's people by law are not allowed to own ! As Obam , seeing that there's no hope in negotiating with the white establishment , turns radical his good friend and mentor Christian Missionary Bruce Craig , John McIntire , tries to get him to see that he's , as well as his brother Kanda , being manipulated by the Communists in his labor party . The Communist who's aim is rule by violence not freedom only want power for themselves not freedom for Obam's people . At first Obam is anything but receptive to Craigs pleas for love and understanding and goes full tilt into revolutionary mode .

Craig for his part put his life on the line running out into the line of fire , between the rampaging Africans and defending white settlers , to stop this madness from getting out of control ! Outstanding performance by the 30 year-old Sidney Poitier that was as good if not better as his Academy Award effort in " Lillies in the Field " or as a back Philadelphia detective in the deep south in the film " In the Heat of the Night " . The fact that " The Mark of the Hawk " is almost unknown to the movie going public in not being shown on TV for at least 30 years or available , until recently , on DVD or video tape has people not realize what a great and timely movie it really is . P . S The multi-talented Eartha Kitt in her first staring movie role as Obam's wife Renee also sings the movies team song " this Man is Mine " referring of course to her husband in the film Obam .
568053	2721657	166322	8.0	Night time's the right time	Updated version of the 1954 Alfred Hitchcock classic " Rear Window " with Christopher Reeves as quadriplegic Jason Kemp who unknowingly spies upon a violent domestic dispute by his neighbors across the yard that possibly later escalated to murder . Recovering from a car smash-up architect Jason Kemp is left without the use of his arms and legs and very bitter that his latest project was given to fellow architect Claudia Henderson , Daryl Hannah , who took over for him while he was hospitalized . Back home Jason is given all the high-tech equipment to make his life , and in-home work , a lot easier . Even his relations with Claudia starts to warm up when he realizes that she's not trying to upstage him but wants him to be part of the project that she's doing . Jason later falls in love with Claudia who among other thing made his life a lot happier by her concern and attention towards him at this very critical time in his recovery . With nothing to do with his free time Jason watches , with a zoom-video camera , what his neighbors are doing across the back-yard of his apartment building . He then soon notices this couple constantly fighting with each other . Not taking it seriously at first Jason sees that the fights are a lot more intense and violent then your average family squabbles . One evening Jason calls 911 when the husband Julian Thorpe , Richie Coaster , beats his wife Ilene , Allison Mackie , to the point where she almost loses consciousness . The next night after Julian was released from police custody Jason hears a blood-curdling scream coming from the Thorpe apartment then all is deathly quite . Spying on the Thorps the next few day , to see if everything is all right , Jason notices something very strange and disturbing . Ilene is no longer there and Julian is living with another woman , who turned out to be Ilene's sister , who stole or also took over Mrs . Thorpe's identity . Better then average made-for-TV thriller that turned out to be actor Chris Reeves ' last , and most personal , movie role . Suspenseful build-up as Thorpe slowly realizes that he's not only being spied on by Jason but that Jason knows what he did to his wife and tries to murder him to keep Jason from going to the police . The ending of " Rear Window " is a bit of a let-down but at the same time more intriguing then that of the 1954 version of the movie by leaving it , the ending , up in the air and to the imagination of the viewers . Chris Reeves was playing himself in the movie " Rear Window " as he was a real victim of a spinal-cord injury , that he suffered from a raiding accident on May 27 , 1995 , that left him paralyzed for the rest of his life until he passed away just days after his 52th birthday . Christopher Reeves made a much bigger impact on the public in the courage that he showed and energies that he gave in battling the disability that he suffered and making it , the cure for Neurolog Disease , the cause that he fought for until his death . Reeves helped create the Christoper Reeves Paralysis Foundation and thus helping , as well as inspiring , thousands of others suffering from that disabling disease with the hope that advanced medical treatments hopefully will eradicate it in the very near future . Chris showed the public , in the last nine years of his life , that he was just as much the man Superman while confined in a wheelchair in real life as the was the comic book hero Superman that he played in the movies .

568863	2721657	50095	8.0	There are some mysteries that are best kept secret	( There are Spoilers ) At an obscure little village on the foothills of the mighty Himalayas world renowned British botanist Dr . John Rollason , Peter Cushing , and his fellow botanist wife Helen , Maureen Connell , are out studying the rare plants that are only indigenous in that part of the world . Unknown to Helen John is planing to go up high in the Himalayas with a team of mountain climbers from the United States headed by Dr . Tom Friend , Forrest Tucker , to find the both illusive and legendary Yeti or Abominable Snowman . intelligence and at the same time though-provoking movie by the up and coming British Hammer Studios that treats the subject matter , the Yeti , in a philosophical not horror-like or threatening way with the Yeti coming across far more human then the humans themselves who are out to either capture him alive . Going against the pleas of his wife Helen and the advice of the local Lahma , Arnold Marle , John together with Tom and his crew of mountain climbers Ed Shelley and Andrew McNee , Robert brown & Michael Brill , and their Sherpa guide Kusang , Wolf Morris , go out in the dead of the Himalayan winter . In an effort to see if all the rumors about the Yeti are true or legend the team finds to their surprise that whatever they heard or read about the snowman don't even scratch the surface . His existence becomes a fact and whats more it turns out that the Yeti's are more human in their behavior towards them and that they , John Tom & Co , are the brutal and uncivilized savages that they depict the Yeti's of being . Tom having gone on earlier climbs in the Himalayas burying hundreds of pounds of food and supplies along the route that he and John are now taking has it all planned perfectly with the winter snows coming . This would force the Yeti's , if there's any , out of their high mountain habitats and into the lower regions of the Himalayas . The fact that Tom has a small team of climbers , five including himself , they wouldn't be that of an intimidating presence to the Yeti's , where they would avoid them , making it more then likely that he and his small team of mountain climbers would run into them . What Tom as well as John & Co , with the possible exception of Kusang , doesn't know is that the Yeti is far more formidable in his powers of mind control or mind manipulation then in his massive strength and ability to scale heights with ease that the most experienced mountain climbers wouldn't even dare to attempt . Making their way up the the 20 , 000 foot level of the mountain the climbers set camp with one of them , McNee , having his ankle badly injured in the climb . It's that very evening that the Yeti's make themselves know by wailing in the night and later one of them tires to enter McNee's , who is somehow hypnotized by the wails , tent . Chasing the Yeti out into the snow Ed Shelley fires a number of shots killing him . McKnee now under some kind of trance walks out of his tent and walking on the dangerous and shifting snows along a steep ridge falls to his death . With the body of a 10 foot 700 pound Yeti secured and rapped up the mountain climbing team now plans to go back to the village and report it's amazing find to the world . A sudden storm then hits the area causing the team to shack up for the night until it blows over . It's then when strange things begin to happen with the Yeti's determined to recover their fellow , and dead , mountain snowman and at the same time after both Ed and Tom are killed from fright and paranoia , but not by the Yeti's , and Kusang after seeing a Yeti flipping out and running for his life down the mountain . It's then that John realizes what the Lhama told him about leaving the secret of the Yeti's existence to himself . John finally gets to see the Yeti's face to face in the last few minutes of the movie and instead of dropping dead from fright at the very sight of them he's almost put into a serene and tranquil state of mind by the humanity that he sees in their eyes . Knowing that they , unlike those who are out to kill and capture them , meant no harm and John turned out to be right . John ended up owing his life to the Yeti's and with that gained a new found respect , or even love , for them to the point where he kept their existence to himself . Telling Helen and the Lahma , who really knew better , back in the village that he found nothing up there in order to prevent other expeditions from climbing up the steep and dangerous Himalayas and not only ending up like his fellow mountain climbers did . In the end the Yeti's is allowed to live in both peace and safety from the inhumanity of the arrogant and unfeeling humans who's greed and sense of superiority over all those , lesser species of life , around them that would lead to their own comeuppance .
568257	2721657	65086	9.0	Suppressed emotions explode on screen in this early Robert Altman Classic	SPOILERS Feeling alone and needing companionship as well as love Frances Austen , Sandy Dennis , keeps all these emotions inside as she goes through life as a popular young single lady who has many high class friends . But for reasons of her own deep insecurity she keeps them at arms length . As for Frances male friends non are anywhere near her age so that she won't have any reason to have any romantic involvement with them . One early evening as Frances was entertaining some of her friends she spots outside her apartment window a young man , Michael Burns , sitting alone in the cold pouring rain . Feeling that he's homeless and alone after her friends leave Frances goes outside to the park and offers the young man shelter at her place until the rain subsides and even to stay over for the night at a guest bedroom that she has . You can see right away that Frances is more interested in just having the young mans safely out of the cold and rain then she wants to have him as a friend lover or even play-toy all for herself and as the movie progresses you see that you were right . A really amazing performance by Sandy Dennis that in a way is very much like that of Kathy Bates ' Academy Award performance in the movie " Misery " that was made in 1990 some twenty one years later . Frances thinking that the young man was alone and homeless and , later when she meets him , mute sees the perfect person for her to have as a true friend . He's in no way her equal or better then her like the friends that she has , doctors lawyers Indian chiefs , and thus is totally dependent on her . It later turns out that the young man is not the lonely and homeless person that Frances thought that he is . It's when she slowly finds out that he really doesn't need her as well as him manipulating her instead the other way around it sets off something in Frances ' mind that turns out to be a compulsion of murderous proportions . A really weird film by director Robert Altman that goes deep into the depths of loneliness and depression of the human mind . Actress Sandy Dennis is perfect as the Dr . Jekyll and Miss . Hyde personality in her acting as the lonely but at the same time dangerous Frances Austen and it's a pity that not only didn't she get an Academy Award for her role in the film but wasn't even nominated for it . Like most Robert Altman movies there seems to be a lot of improvisation among the actors in the movie and ad lib dialog especially between the young man's sister Nina , Susanne Benton , and her boyfriend Nick , David Garfield . The only thing in the movie that I found confusing is when we see Frances go to a city clinic to have a full gynecological exam and tells the doctor that she expects to get married very soon . Was her husband to be the young man staying at her apartment ? But besides that the movie sticks to the story pretty well and the ending is a real shock to the audience as well as the young man . When he finally , in the end , realizes that Frances is not only a bit off-the-wall but murderously insane as well .

568459	2721657	180093	9.0	Something about life that you won't learn in school or college	SPOILER ALERT Dark and gruesome but at the same time extremely realistic movie about the use and addiction to drugs both legal and illegal and the tragic results to those involved . The movie " Requiem for a Dream " doesn't take place in the ghettos of the inner cities that we're used to seeing stories like this but in the middle-class and mostly Jewish neighborhood of Conley Island in Brooklyn NY . The story of " Requiem for a Dream " centers around four people , Sara , Eilen Byrson , her son Harry , Jared Leto , his girlfriend Marion , Jennifer Connelly , and Harry's best friend Tyrone , Marlon Wayans . Sara lives by herself with her son Harry in a high rise apartment in Conley Island . Widowed she watches TV and wants to be a contestant on a show that she loves but feels that she's too heavy and not attractive looking enough to be on TV and have all her friends see her . Sara's son Harry is a local neighborhood hustler who steals TV's or whatever else he can get his hands on to make some money to get himself through the day . Harry's girlfriend Marion seems to come from a good family but she's in love with Harry and as we all know that " Love is Blind " . Marion doesn't seem to care what Harry is doing and where he might well end up , she just want's to be with him , and feels that they both together will somehow make a go of their lives because Harry has a good mind for business and will work himself up the ladder at whatever vocation he takes up . One day Harry's best friend Tayrone comes up with an idea that they can all make lot's of money by selling drugs and that he has a connection that will get them started in the venture . Meanwhile Harry's mom Sara gets a reply to an application that she sent to the TV show that she watches all day and night that she's been accepted to be on the show as a contestant . Sara starts trying to lose weigh by taking pills that she buys over the counter or what her doctor prescribes to her and in no time all she becomes addicted to them . Harry Tyrone as well as Marion at first are making big money in their drug business but after a while with the threat of the police as well as other rivals drug dealers , and not to mention the addicts that they deal with , their drug business starts to dry up . Before long all three like most drug dealers also become addicted to the very drugs that they were selling . Darren Aronosfsky's " Requiem for a Dream " is one of the most depressing as well as realistic movies about urban life in regards to drug addiction that's ever been filmed . I have to remind the readers that it takes a very strong stomach to be able to sit through and watch the movie . In the end we see what drugs can do the the human mind body and spirit and it isn't very pretty . Hollywood has come a long way in the making of movies about drug addiction since the Frank Sinatra Film " Man with the Golden Arm " back in 1955 . " Requiem for a Dream " is a movie everyone should see regardless of it's really disturbing bleak and down right pit-in-hell ending . If it were made back in 1955 when " Man with the Golden Arm " was released and if millions of people saw it back then the drug problems of today would be a hell of a lot smaller .
568864	2721657	56930	9.0	It can happen to anyone ! It happened to a sister of the President of the United States !	SOME SPOILERSHard hitting as well as moving story about a subject matter that at the time , 1963 , was almost never mentioned even by those affected by it afflicting a family member , much less made into a major motion picture : mental retardation . As the movie " A Child Is Waiting " begins we see 12 year-old Reuben , Bruce Ritchey , left alone by his father Mr . Ted Widdicombe , Steven Hill , at the steps of a school for the mentally retarded Looking terribly confused and feeling lost . Reuben is borderline retarded which is the worst kind of mental retardation that a young boy like him can suffer from . Since even though Reuben has the mind of a five year old he can still understand that he's different from other normal boys and girls that he went to school with . Even worse Reuben can understand that he's been abandoned by those who love him his parents Ted and Sophie Widdicombe , Gena Rowland . The school is run by psychiatrist Dr . Ben Clark , Burt Lancaster , who can be both as sensitive as a Mother Theresa as well as tough as a US Marine drill sergeant to the boys and girls in the school . It's later when Jean Hansen , Judy Garland , shows up for a job as a music teacher that little Reuben takes a very strong liking toward her . Miss . Hansen immediately connects with Reuben as a surrogate mother who by paying too much attention towards him has her ignoring the other children that's in her class . The movie goes deep into exploring as well as enlightening the audience on what mental retardation not only is but also how so many people back in the early 1960's . The film shows how Miss . Hansen has good but at the same time naively misplaced feeling for those suffering from the disability . Dr . Clark sees right away that Miss . Hansen's feeling for Reuben will only drive him more into the shell that he's already in and warns her not to , which she does anyway , have his mother come over to see him . which ends with Reuben having an emotional breakdown and then running away from the school grounds . Reuben being found by the local police and brought back to the school has a very distraught Miss . Hansen , who holds herself responsible for what he did , offered to resign . Instead she's graciously given a second chance by Dr . Clark to stay on . Miss . Hansen stopped babying Reuben and started treating him like all the other students in her class and with that he stopped feeling like he was helpless and unable to function on the outside , as well as in the school , on his own . That lead the young boy to finally open up and be able to communicate with both his teachers and the other students in the school . A difficult movie to watch but that in no way takes away the powerful impact that " A Child Is Waiting " has on those watching it . Were and Miss . Hansen are shown by Dr . Clark what happens to children who are overly protected from the world and people around them by those who love them by not letting them go out in the world and live meaningful lives to what ever level their limited mental capacity will bring them . There's a very disturbing but effective scene in an adult sanitarium for the mentally retarded where we see the unfortunates there who were coddled by their parents , like Miss . Hansen was coddling Reuben , who were left on heir own when their parents died or were to old and infirm to take care of them anymore . Unlike young children like Reuben they became so severely retarded that there was no chance for them to ever recover . Director John Cassavetes is seen as one of the sanitarium inmates walking around aimlessly waving his hands and talking to himself in an Alfred Hitchcock-like cameo in the film . Burt Lancaster is at his usual best as the hard but well meaning Dr . Clark . Newcomer 12 year-old Bruce Ritchey is both touching and tragic as the retarded young boy who finds a home and family at the school that makes him for the first time in his short life really feel wanted . But it's the former child star and singing sensation Judy Garland as the very sensitive and understanding but somewhat naive music teacher Miss . Hansen who want's to find a meaning and reason to her life , by helping others . Judy Garland's Miss . Hansen really stands out in the movie as she learns that love if used with emotion not wisdom can be like a double-edge sword . Love for it to work effectively , like with Reuben , you have to let you mind override your feelings for it to succeed on whom ever your directing it on .

Laurie's desperate actions causes her husband and partner in crime to , for the first time since he was a little boy , aim and shoot to kill at something , other then an inanimate object or target , that's alive and finally end it once in for all for both Laurie as well as himself .
568450	2721657	436720	9.0	Bad Blood	The film " Ring of Fire " centers around the three Emile Griffith Benny " Kid " Paret Welterweights Championship bouts . The first taking place in Miami Beach on April 1 , 1961 . Griffith looking sluggish and behind on points suddenly came to life and wrestled the championship belt away from Paret flooring him in the 13th round with a double left hood followed by a straight right putting the champ on Queer Street . The second championship fight between the two welterweights took place on September 30 , 1961 in New York's old Madison Square Garden and went the full 15 , the distance , rounds . Paret surprising many fight fans in attendance and watching on TV by winning a split decision and regaining the championship that he lost to Griffith six months earlier . As the two fighters were about to weigh in on the eve of their rubber match again in the Garden on March 24 , 1962 bad blood had developed between the two pugilists to the point where they almost had it out right there and then . Paret started needling Griffith , more to disrupt his concentration on the fight then anything else , about his sexuality calling him a " queer or homosexual " , to put it mildly , in Spanish . These uncalled for remarks on Paret's part really started to get under Griffith's skin as well as enraged and set him off later in the ring . In the fight there was no love lost between the two with both Griffith and Paret slugging it out toe to toe for eleven rounds . Griffith earlier in the sixth was knocked down , for the first time in his professional boxing career , by a devastating one two , right left combination , by a revitalized Paret . Paret then started slowly taking control of the fight in the middle and later rounds and leading on points , in the opinion of many at ringside , as the fateful and fatal 12th round started . The 12th round for the most part was uneventful until with about a minute left Griffith suddenly caught Paret with a hooking solid right that stunned him knocking him into the ropes . Before Paret could counter or even cover up Griffith swarmed all over him , like a windmill , with two dozen punches with Paret not throwing a single one return . Paret was left unconscious and propped against the ropes with the fight stopped by referee Ruby Goldstein with 51 seconds left in the round . Benny " Kid " Parets skull was so baldly battered that he , ten days later , died in Roosevealt Hospital from a massive blood clot without regaining consciousness . Even though were shown what Emile Griffith did in his boxing career since his last fight with Benny " Kid " Paret it was that fight that haunted him for he rest of his days , in and out of the ring . The Paret fatal boxing match not only had caused Griffith to lose his killer instinct in the ring but may very well have caused him to become an alcoholic . It wasn't Until he met with Benny " Kid " Parets son some 40 years later and , with Benny Jr kindness love and understanding , Griffith finally made peace with himself . Brutal but extremely moving documentary about a brutal sport Professional Boxing and those who participate in it both in and out of the ring . Mrs . Paret left a widow with an infant son Benny Jr . after her husbands untimely death has never really recovered from the shock that took Benny Sr . away from her on March 24 , or really officially April 4 , 1962 . It's only her son Benny Jr . who we see at the end of the movie finally meeting face to face the man Emile Griffith who was responsible for his fathers death . The scene between the two is one of most emotionally packed encounters even put on the big or small screen that no amount of acting could possibly duplicated . Emile Griffith himself had suffered his fair amount of tragedies since his final battle with Benny Paret . Not only losing the championship belt that he took from the fallen champion that terrible night but losing almost everything that he won in the ring leaving him broke . Later after getting a job helping out young men in prison to go straight and , if they have any talent , pursue a boxing career he himself was almost beaten to death in 1992 . That's when Griffith was brutally attacked one evening , leaving dead drunk from a NYC bar , and robbed by a gang of thugs who beat the 55 year-old ex-champ to the point that he almost died from kidney failure . We get to see in the end how Emile Griffith finally got closer from the demons that had been tormenting him ever since that horrible evening some 45 years ago when he should have been celebrating the biggest victory he ever won in the ring . Griffith instead went into long a tail-spin that didn't end . It wasn't until he finally got to see and talk to the son , Benny Paret Jr , of the person he killed that night in he boxing ring . It's then that he saw that forgiveness from Benny Jr is far more powerful then the hate that he had for his dad that not only lead to the psychical death of Benny " Kid " Paret but , until he finally got to talk to Benny Jr , the spiritual and emotional death of himself as well .

Cragis , in a speech to the members of the Order , uses Dr . Raven's death as an excuse to make that the robots are dangerous and should be dismantled and used only sparingly . Not to be used in as many functions for the human race as they are being used now . After Cragis's speech one of his colleagues tells him that his sister Emse , Frances McCann , is having an affair , rapport is the word used in the movie , with a robot . If this ever comes out , Cragis is told , it would hurt his position in the Order . Cragis goes to see his sister to get her to break off her rapport with the robot , Pax , David Cross . In Cragis's conversation with his sister , as well as with the robot Pax , something very unusual happens ! What transpired after that in the movie makes Cragis see what the truth is and that changes him forever . Great movie with some of the most thought-provoking , penetrating and intelligent dialog about life death God the soul and the continuation of the existence of the species . Dialog that you'll ever hear in a serious film about those subjects , It will also make you think like you never thought before about the future . The scene between Cragis his sister Esme and the robot Pax as well as Cragis's girlfriend Maxine , Erica Elliot , alone is enough to make you change your views about what you think that the future is going to be . And with an ending that will leave you speechless and at the same time hopeful for what the future will bring . It's too bad that the movie " Creation of the Humanoids " is not on tape or DVD and hasn't been broadcast on TV for the last fifteen years or so . The movie viewing public is missing a real eye-opening film about future events that will shock and at the same time assure us about what we are to face ahead .
