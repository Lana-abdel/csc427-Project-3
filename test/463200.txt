478956	463200	65031	1.0	Homophobic and dull	A gay couple ( Rex Harrison and Richard Burton ) in 1960s England . Burton is a hairdresser ( of course ) and Harrison is an actor . They complain nonstop , tear each other apart verbally , dress horribly , hate their mothers and are depressed and full of self-loathing . I suppose this was revolutionary in 1969 but it's horribly offensive today . The movie was subtitled " A sad gay story " . The script is dull , the film looks horrible and the actors . . . Harrison minces around and preens so much I got very angry - - a sick , disgraceful performance . I heard he wasn't too proud of it either . Burton is actually OK - - he brings some dignity to his role . But this film is a total waste of time . It just shows gay men as being pathetic lonely creatures and is very condescending . Offensiveness aside it's sleep-inducing - - I kept dozing off ! Sick , depressing , homophobic . . . there's no reason to see this . Makes " Boys in the Band " look like a comedy . Dudley Moore did the music ! ! !
477632	463200	83550	1.0	Makes Part 1 look like " Gone With the Wind "	The original " Amityville Horror " was not a good horror film . It wasn't totally worthless either - - it had good acting , a few nice scares and a great ending . . . but it wasn't that good . Still , compared to this , it's some sort of a masterpiece . Purportedly this took place before " The Amityville Horror " which came out in 1979 . It shows a severely dysfunctional family with an abusive father ( Burt Young ) . The son ( imaginatively named Sonny ) starts hearing noises and voices . He also ( for no good reason ) starts an incestuous relationship with his sister . Then he slowly starts to go crazy and the voices tell him to kill his family . . . The story is by the numbers , the acting in this one is bad and the material is very disturbing - - Sonny ( who looks about 22 but is supposed to be a teenager ) seducing his sister is particularly sick ( and needless ) . The special effects are sickening , not frightening and the movie manages to be boring and sleazy all at once . The only part that scared me was when the girl was trying to run away from her brother ( who has a gun ) . . . and literally runs right into him . A stupid , sleazy , boring horror film . Avoid .
477719	463200	52718	1.0	Good idea badly handled	I caught this boring film on late night TV many many years ago . The plot sounded interesting so I tuned in . Boy , was that a mistake ! I hate Westerns but I love horror movies - - I though this would concentrate on both genres . WRONG ! It's a low-budget Western all the way with a few mild vampire touches thrown in . The only mildly horrific scene was when the vampire was shown in his coffin . . . but that's it . No blood , no fangs and a vampire that can walk around in daylight ! Also very VERY dull . The acting was actually very good - - that's what kept me watching . So , if you like odd Westerns this is for you . If you're a horror movie fan , stay away . ( Unless you like boring horror films )
479429	463200	118688	1.0	Talk about overkill !	Batman ( George Clooney ) and Robin battle Mr . Freeze ( Arnold Schwarzenegger ) and Poison Ivy ( Uma Thurman ) . Meanwhile Alfred ( Michael Gough ) is dying and his niece ( Alicia Silverstone ) visits and becomes Batgirl ! Oh yeah - - and Bane is helping Ivy . . . Wow - - what a MESS ! I never liked the first two Batman films ( too dark and violent ) . The third was light but fun . This is just moronic from the word go . There are tons of bad jokes flying left and right from heroes and villains ( if Arnie had made one more " cold " joke I would have screamed ! ) . No dialogue - - just stupid jokes . I knew I was in trouble during the first big fight sequence : Batman and Robin are battling Mr . Freeze but are sliding on the ice he produces . They're on their backs boots in the air , click the boots together . . . and SKATES pop out ! ! ! ! ! Even for a comic book film that was ridiculous ! The plot is thin to begin with , but at the end it's just completely incomprehensible . Its like the screenwriters threw up their hands and gave up . The movie is always throwing things at you - - never stopping for breath . At first it's fun . . . but it wears you down . There's an entire motorcycle race thrown in for no reason ! GREAT special effects . . . but that's all there is . Also the homoeroticism in here is upped to a ridiculous degree . Can ANYONE explain why Batman and Robins suits have nipples ? ? ? ? And why doesn't Silverstone's suit have them ? Isn't that sexist ? And why does O'Donnell have a bigger cod piece than Clooney ? Acting is pretty poor . Clooney ( who admits that he hated the film ) looks uncomfortable and ( he says ) he played Bruce Wayne as gay . I never caught that though - - and I'm gay ! O'Donnell is drop dead handsome and drop dead bland . He plays Robin as an obnoxious brat - - again ( he did it in " Batman Forever " too ) . I kept waiting for Clooney to deck him . Silverstone is OK I guess . Gough is given nothing to do but look sick . Schwarzenegger - - he never COULD act and his reciting of the " comic " lines are painful . Thurman seems so totally lost that she got desperate - - she vamps it up to an embarrassing degree . Her lines were SO pathetic I actually groaned aloud and rolled my eyes a few times ! Only John Glover is any fun by hamming it up mercilessly as the mad ( sigh ) scientist who creates Bane . Big , loud and incredibly stupid . It's easy to see why this killed the Batman franchise .
478435	463200	171344	1.0	Boring and silly	First off , the title is wrong . There are girls and there is a gang but they're only incidental to the story . Most of the movie deals with a bunch of very overage " teenagers " getting hooked on heroin . Purportedly this movie is supposed to be a warning against it , yet it shows them all having a great time while on it ! They're singing , dancing ( a sequence that goes on for 10 minutes . Why ? To eat up running time ! ) and having sex . . . so what it they're hooked ? There's even a sequence which shows - - step by step - - how to inject heroin ! Very cheaply done , all horrible acting with uproarious dialogue . Also the worst use of music ever ! Most of the time it doesn't even fit the scene ! It's really hard to explain how totally worthless this movie is . Not even bad / good . Skip it .
477634	463200	65481	1.0	Well acted but sleazy and slow	Silly psychological drama about Ma Barker and her sons who robbed and killed in the 1920s . Roger Corman directed this . . . it seems like he was actually trying to do a serious movie . . . sadly , it doesn't work at all . This movie has a following but damned if I know why . It is very well-acted but the script and direction ramble all over the place . Also I found most of the actors dialogue unintelligible - - they're all putting on stupid Southern accents which don't help . Also , the movie is VERY sleazy . Rape , murder , incest , torture , beatings , drug abuse , homosexuality ( portrayed negatively unfortunately ) . . . you name it . I'm no prude , but this movie rubs your face in it . For instance , the opening scene has a young girl ( about 13 ) being held down by her brothers while her father rapes her ! This is ALMOST worth seeing to see Shelley Winters chewing the scenery as Ma and Robert DeNiro before he hit it big . All in all , a must miss .
477911	463200	83722	1.0	Why ?	Fist off , remaking a classic horror film is a stupid idea . Second : adding blood and gore doesn't help . Third : Neither does nudity . Fourth : WHY ? ? ? POSSIBLE SPOILERSA pointless remake of a great horror film . In the original Simone Simon can't have sex with a man - - if she does she'll kill him . In this remake , the woman ( Nastassja Kinski ) has a brother ( Malcolm McDowell ) and she can only have sex with him and not kill him . Unfortunately she's in love with John Heard . Kinski is not a good actress - - never was . Having her nude throughout most of the movie doesn't help . McDowell really , really tries but he's given nothing to work with . Heard looks miserable ( understandably ) and poor Annette O'Toole does in famous pool sequence from the original topless . Why ? So we could squeeze some more gratuitous female nudity into this . Pointless , boring , not scary . If Schrader is so interested in nude females , why doesn't he just do a porno flick ? See the original .
477643	463200	91898	1.0	Horrible	Dreadful , justly obscure ghost story . Mary Page Keller and Andrew Stevens play a couple who move into a haunted house . Then Stevens is possessed by a ghost and begins to kill people . . . or something like that . To be honest I had trouble staying awake so the story is kind of vague . Dumb , by the numbers " horror " film loaded with false scares and stupid sequences . Like a workman , working outside the house , is killed and hung . . . and supposedly hangs there for days on end with no one noticing . Or Keller has a pointless dream sequence where a co worker slashes her throat . . . and leads to nothing . It's only in there to throw some cheap gore into our face . Keller ( who can be good ) is lousy and Stevens ( who has never been good ) is even worse . Dull and pointless . Avoid .
479666	463200	78740	1.0	Bottom of the barrel here folks !	The last of the " Airport " sequels . This has Alain Delon and George Kennedy ( who was in all the Airport movies ) as pilots ; David Warner ( ! ! ! ) as the radio engineer ; Susan Blakely as a newswoman targeted for death ; Robert Wagner as a brilliant scientist ( stop laughing ! ) ; Eddie Albert as a president of the airlines ; Charo in a dreadful " comical " bit ; John Davidson as a newsman ( love how his hair stays in place even AFTER the plane turns upside down ! ) ; poor Martha Raye is humiliated ; Cicely Tyson plays a mother who is flying a heart for her dying son ( stop rolling your eyes ! ) ; Jimmie Walker as a clarinet player ( what did I say about not laughing ? ) ; Mercedes McCambridge as a Russian gymnastics coach ( OK you can laugh at that one ) ; Bibi Andresson as a hooker and Sylvia Kristel and Sybil Danning as love interests . Just pathetic . Full of stupid plots and dialogue that will have you roaring - - watch for Davidson getting " married " on the plane near the end ! The Concorde is taking all these people to Russia . They're attacked with missiles , escape , land safely in France and TAKE OFF AGAIN the very next day ! ! ! ! Don't you think the flight would have been cancelled or something ? Most of the acting is terrible - - McCambridge is a sight to behold in a red fright wig and a horrible fake accent . The only good acting is from Kennedy and Delon ( looking fantastic ) who gives a very engaging performance . Still that's not enough to make you sit through this drivel . Too long and lousy special effects too . This was a mega-bomb and ( thankfully ) stopped Universal from doing anymore .
478258	463200	113650	1.0	Pretty dreadful	A real obnoxious guy ( Wally White ) decides to leave his job in NY and spend the summer in Provincetown MA and find Mr . Right . OK - - this is LOUSY . For starters - - every gay stereotype is trotted out to go through its motions . Second , there's no plot . Third , ALL the characters are obnoxious . Fourth , I've been to PTown - - this was obviously shot off season and it REALLY shows . Fifth , almost no one can act . Sixth , did I mention the main character is really obnoxious ? Seven , all the " comedy " is lousy . A particularly bad sequence is White picking out dancers from square states ( don't ask ) . The ONLY bright spot here is Randy Becker . He turns in the sole good performance and is VERY hot ( to put it mildly ) ! But he also plays a real jerk . Basically one of the worst gay films ever - - maybe THE worst ! I wish I could give it a 0 - - it's not good enough for a 1 !
479264	463200	52969	1.0	Laughable campy movie	A tough rough sea captain named Thorne Sherman ( James Best ) , love interest Ann Craigis ( Ingrid Goude ) , hot-headed boyfriend Jerry ( Ken Curtis ) , two scientists and a token black and token Latino guy are stuck on an island during a hurricane with large killer shrews running loose . The scientists developed them to deal with overpopulation ( ! ! ! ) but they escaped . There is a boat offshore . . . but how will they get to it with the shrews running around ? You won't really care . Pretty silly with a stupid script ( come on - - large killer shrews ? ? ? ) and laughable dialogue . The shrews themselves look like what they are - - either puppets or dogs with extra fur on them and fake fangs . Nothing is shown when the shrews attack someone and the first ones to die are ( of course ) the black guy then the Latino . If this were a good movie I would find that offensive . The sets are cheap ( it shows ) and the ending is howlingly bad . Acting isn't that good . Best is terrible - - he just stands around with a blank look on his face and yells orders . Goude is certainly beautiful but no actress . She tries but it's no go . However her wavering Swedish accent was amusing . Curtis is stuck with the stock villain role and he's not half bad . Everybody else are stuck in clichéd roles and play them out as best as they can . This played constantly on a local TV station back in the 1970s . I was in high school then and thought it was silly but fun . Now it comes across as VERY silly and more than a little campy . If you're in the mood you might enjoy this for laughs . Otherwise stay far away .
477340	463200	29120	1.0	One of Crawford's worst	Elaborate , star-studded movie about a jewel thief ( Joan Crawford ) falling in love with a man she's supposed to rob . . . or something like that . This is a horrible movie - - just one of the worst I've ever seen . It is beautiful to look at , has a great cast and they all give great performances ( especially Crawford - - she's gorgeous and letter perfect in her role ) . Then why do I hate this so much ? The dialogue and plot . The plot is as old as the hills and the script is chock-full of totally unbelievable dialogue that no human being would ever utter . Virtually every other line was so bewildering that I could not get into the characters or the story . Also the film is very static - - it feels very much like a stage play filmed . And it's very , very slow and dullMaybe I shouldn't judge the film - - as it is I tried to watch it twice and fell asleep both times ! I made it through an hour and then dozed off . I think the stupid dialogue kept me awake for that long . This film was unavailable ( for some reason ) from the 1960s to the early 1980s . Unfortunately it's now out there . Do yourself a favor - - if you're a Crawford fan ( like I am ) don't see this . It's really terrible .
479413	463200	221583	2.0	Pretty horrendous	This takes place on Fire Island back in the 1970s . A couple Peter ( Craig Dudley ) and Buddy ( J . Will Deane ) are throwing a 4th of July party at their house . Unfortunately their relationship is falling apart and they have to get ready for a house full of very strange guests . The rest of the movie chronicles the party and what happens between Peter and Buddy . OK - - I'm a gay man but I was 8 back when this was made . If this is a true view of what gay life was in the 1970s , I'm glad I wasn't around . From the puzzling opening credits which shows kids playing in the sand ( ? ? ? ) this movie slides slowly into disaster . There's a guru ( Robert Case ) who talks nonstop about nothing of any importance . I wanted to gag the guy halfway into his first LONG speech . There's the young kid Danny who is there for his first time . There's the lesbian couple ( who do nothing - - except one strips for no reason ) . There's the leather queen . Worst of all is the effeminate man named Jimmy ( Jimmy Foster ) . We're introduced to him and his friend ( whose name I never got ) when they get a flat tire . They basically scream and screech for 10 minutes and have NO idea how to fix a flat . I know some people find this funny but I found it offensive and pretty sad . The party itself is full of people you would never want to know . It's like being dumped in a party full of bad actors playing obnoxious people . With the sole exception of Dudley no one can act . This may be valuable as a portrait of what Fire Island was like in the 1970s . . . but it's pretty dull viewing . This gets a 2 only for the frequent male nudity of some very nice bodies .
479657	463200	52929	2.0	Not bad-good , just BAD ! ! ! !	Very boring , very stupid and just plain lousy movie about invisible invaders taking over Earth by possessing dead bodies . The idea sounds intriguing and the cameo by John Carradine at the beginning gives one hope , but it very quickly falls to pieces . Even at 67 minutes this movie is slllooooowwwww ! All the acting sucks - - the worst being by Pelner ( ? ? ) . Notice how she handles every development in the film - - she puts her hands to the sides of her face and her mouth hangs open . The first time it's OK , second time OK , third time it gets on your nervers , every time thereafter makes you want to either laugh out loud or kick in your TV set ! ( I had both reactions ) . It's not so bad it's good - - it's too boring for that . The only way to make it through this film is get a bunch of friends , drink LOTS of beer , then watch the movie . You'll probably enjoy it more drunk than sober ! Bottom of the barrel fare .
478931	463200	280665	2.0	DePalma hits rock bottom	Jaw droppingly bad movie about a jewel thief ( Rebecca Romijn ) committing a robbery with others - - but she takes the jewels and leaves them high and dry . She pops up years later with a totally new identity . . . but can't escape her past . Somehow Antonio Banderas gets involved in this . Hoo boy ! This is just beyond bad . Boring , stupid and badly acted ( although Romijn has her moments - - Banderas appears drugged - - maybe he was ) . The story is pretty predictable and ( aside from some typically nice directorial touches from DePalma ) there's nothing even remotely interesting here . And , by the end of the movie , DePalma throws in a twist that is SO bad and clichéd I seriously thought he was kidding . I saw this at the movies and I was just so upset by it I yelled out , " Oh come ON ! " Not one person told me to be quiet . Also Banderas doesn't pop up in this until the movie is almost half over - - a wise choice . I give this a two only for some nice shots - - otherwise this is an all time career low for everybody involved . Avoid .
478610	463200	82812	2.0	I remember when they were filming this in Boston . . .	it was great ! Lots of excitement . . . too bad the movie sucks . Someone is killing women in a school in Boston . That's basically it for the plot . It's slow , dull with no gore ( except for one very unpleasant scene ) . The only reasons I'm giving this a " 2 " instead of a " 1 " are : Rachel Ward - - she's very good ( despite the material ) and extremely beautiful and Boston itself . It looks great on the screen and the sequences in Beacon Hill perfectly capture the look and feel of the area . Ward herself was once asked about this movie . Her response ? She said it was a terrible movie that she was dreadful in ( I disagree with the last part of that statement ) . So , it's ALMOST worth seeing for Ward and Boston . Basically this is a boring , dull slasher movie . Avoid .
479046	463200	87384	3.0	Hard to Watch ! ! ! !	James Roberts ( Rick Springfield ) is the lead singer of a successful band . The band also has his ex-girlfriend Nicki ( Patti Hansen ) who has a nasty disposition and temper . Roberts than meets cute Diana Lawson ( Janet Eilber ) in a car accident . . . and immediately falls in love . Naturally she doesn't know who he is . . . or care . Totally predictable complications ensure . Caught this drivel in a movie theatre way back in 1984 . Springfield was big with teenage girls back then and the theatre was packed with them . More than half walked out before the movie was half over ! It's truly that bad ! The script is moronic and painfully obvious - - all the characters act like idiots . Also the acting wavers . Hansen and Eilber are actually pretty good but Springfield . . . . OK - - he tries . He REALLY tries and it gets embarrassing to watch . He just can't act but , back then , he was a very attractive man so at least he was fun to look at . The movie does have its bright moments - - Springfield bares his butt two or three times ( within PG boundaries ) and I DO like the soundtrack . At that time the song " Love Somebody " was a monster hit and it's played twice in the movie . Also the concert sequences work very well . But the sappy love story and bad acting by Springfield do make this a chore to watch sometimes . I can honestly only give it a 3 . It's not the worst movie I've ever seen but it's definitely down there . And - - really - - teenage fans of his walked out on this !
479184	463200	26007	3.0	Stupid , tasteless , boring , offensive . . .	. . . and those are this picture's GOOD qualities ! The Bubsy Berkeley numbers are the only thing worth watching and save this film from being a total bomb . The acting varies from bad ( Doleros del Rio ) to unendurable ( everybody else ) . Jolson and Powell were especially terrible . Powell grins and laughs so much you just want to punch him . Jolson overacts every single line ! I don't care how good of a singer he was - - his acting sucks ! The comedy was either unfunny or tasteless ( there's actually a running joke about a man wanting to commit suicide ! ) . The " dramatic " scenes were dull , dull , DULL ! And the final big number " Going to Heaven on a Mule " was one of the most racist things I've EVER seen in a movie . It has Jolson and other white performers all in black face , happy in Heaven where they eat fried chicken and watermelon ! ! ! ! There's actually a scene where a giant watermelon opens up and there's a white / black guy tap dancing ! If you see it on tape , pick it up just for the Berkeley musical numbers - - fast forward through everything else . I give it a .
477601	463200	92099	3.0	Top crap	Boring , predictable groaner about a cocky Air Force cadet who needs to learn a few life lessons before becoming a great pilot . Every single cliché is here - - the close buddy that dies so Cruise can " grow up " ; the aeronautics instructor ( or whatever Kelly McGillis played ) in love with him ; the booming tops 40s soundtrack ; the final aerial dogfight where Cruise saves his companions - - - YAWN ! ! ! This movie was a huge hit in 1986 because it gave audiences something safe and predictable . Also the movie has a horrendous performance by Cruise ( he's always bad but he REALLY sucks here - - he grins his way through the entire performance ) , an even worse one by McGillis ( SHE has a PhD in aeronautics ? ? ? ? Hah ! More like one in makeup ! ) , a total lack of sexual chemistry between them , a good ol ' buddy who you know is dogmeat from frame 1 ( Anthony Edwards giving the only good performance ) , another cocky young hothead ( Val Kilmer sneering away ) , a tough but kind leader ( Tom Skerritt , looking totally lost ) and a film that is , basically , an Air Force recruiting poster . Also dogfights that play like video games and the film seems to make war look like kids play . There's also a totally hysterical line when McGillis ( who is about 5 inches taller than Cruise ) looks DOWN at him and breathes , " When I first saw you you were 7 feet tall ! " A total waste of time - - I'm giving it a three cause I like some of the songs ( especially " Take My Breath Away " ) . So buy the soundtrack . . . skip the movie .
479261	463200	295254	4.0	Visually interesting . . . but that's it	Movie about a website in which you get killed in 2 days after watching it . . . or something like that . The plot is vague and the explanation for the killing was particularly stupid . Also Natascha McElhone was atrocious - - I've NEVER seen a worst actress ! Her facial expressions never matched the dialogue and her romance with Stephen Dorff comes out of nowhere . I NEVER want to see her again . Stephen Rea is just as bad as the killer ( believe me , I'm not giving anything away ) . He keeps babbling away in a thin , reedy voice before killing his victims . Most of what he says is the worst dialogue every written and he says . . . it . . . so . . . SLOWLLLLLLYYYYYYYYYY ! ! ! ! ! I felt like yelling " Shut up and kill them ! " Still , this wasn't a total disaster . There was some nice photography here ; there's a sequence with thousands of cockroaches that had me squirming ; Stephen Dorff is pretty good ( and a really hot , good-looking guy - - too bad he remains fully dressed ) and there is some really disturbing imagery of dead or bound women . But , all in all , it's not worth $9 . 00 or $10 . 00 . Worth a rental if you're a Dorff fan like me .
478529	463200	77975	4.0	Lousy film but , in a way , a classic	1962 : Faber College . A fraternity ( Delta House ) has for years tormented Dean Wormer ( John Vernon ) by trashing his campus and wrecking havoc with really sick , immature behavior . He finally decides to do everything he can to close them down , but they won't go out without a fight . . . This was a HUGE hit in 1978 ( and a hit again when it was rereleased in 1980 ) . I never understood why . The jokes are lame and the humor was , for its time , pretty risque . Nowadays it's pretty tame ( for an R-rated film ) . Also I saw it in a theatre in 1978 when I was in high school - - I didn't laugh once . Seeing it again over 20 years later it's even worse . But , this was the first film of its type ( the slobs vs . the snobs ) and lead to many VERY bad imitators . Compared to those this IS a classic . But still not good . It has some good things in it . It's amusing to see then unknown Kevin Bacon so young ; Peter Riegert and Karen Allen make a very appealing couple ( but their dramatic back story is dull ) ; John Vernon is excellent , and very funny , as Dean Wormer ; Tim Matheson is also very good - - he nicely underplays his role ( and flashes his butt briefly ) ; this made John Belushi a star ( he IS funny - - sometimes ) ; there's great direction by John Landis ( especially during the " Shout " number ) ; there's a bombastic Elmer Bernstein score that helps and seeing Tom Hulce and Stephen Furst so young is incredible . BUT that doesn't excuse the lousy script ; horrible jokes ; the sexism ; the racism ; Donald Sutherland's pointless and lousy performance and the fact that this film is DULL ! ! ! ! ! ! I'm giving it a 4 . . . and I'm BEING generous !
477974	463200	295700	4.0	OK for a rainy day	Chris Flynn ( Desmond Harrington ) is driving through West Virginia for a job interview . While driving through the woods he ( accidentally ) runs into a group of friends whose car is broken down . They go for help and find themselves face to face with a group of inbred cannibals . . . and they're stuck in the middle of nowhere . . . . So-so . The plot has been done MANY times in the past - - this turns into a variation of " The Hills Have Eyes " ( which I didn't like ) . The acting is OK I guess , but no one is given anything to work with . Harrington and Eliza Dushku try . On the plus side this moves fairly quick ( it's only 84 minutes ) , delivers the goods in terms of gore and violence ( one murder made me jump ) and Dushku plays a strong intelligent woman who fights back full force . But there's nothing really new here . Worth watching on a rainy afternoon if you have NOTHING else to view . I give it a 4 .
478434	463200	100670	4.0	Horrible but fun , in a silly way , . . .	ONLY if you grew up during the 1970s . David Cassidy ( looking great ) , Olivia d'Abo ( with English accent intact ) and Geoff Hoyle ( WHO ? ? ? ) travel from 2176 to 1976 by mistake . While there totally predictable " hilarity " ensures . The jokes are horribly bad ( there's not one good one ! ) and the story and dialogue are truly abysmal . Also it contains a character called Snodgrass ( ho ho ) who gives one of the worst performances in comedy history - - his idea of acting is SCREAMING every line full force . Still , I ( sort of ) enjoyed it . They caught the 70s dead on - - as a child of the 70s I can attest to that ! The fashions , the music , the cars , the horrible furniture and carpets - - all perfect ! For me it was a trip back to the past . Also , the cast gives their all to the awful script . And the movie does come to life in one sequence in which d'Abo and Leif Garrett ( another 70s icon ) do the Hustle ! Boy , did that bring me back ! Worth seeing only for those who remember or lived through the 70s . All others - - beware !
477538	463200	160127	4.0	Sexist , stupid and boring	Wow ! What a load of cp ! I didn't think it was possible , but this movie is even worse than the TV show ! The plot is beyond stupid - - to be totally honest I can't really remember it . Anyways , it's just an excuse to have Drew Barrymore , Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz get into VERY tight outfits and prance around . I'm really surprised this film got a PG - - there's so much flesh shown on these girls ! It goes VERY close to an R more than once . Also the jokes are very stupid - - one of them has Liu being a lousy cook ! I thought that stereotype disappeared in the ' 50s ! As for the acting - - Lynch is very good in her role ; Bill Murray looks miserable ; Barrymore looks confused ; Liu can't act ; Matt LeBlanc ( as Liu's boyfriend ) is basically playing Joey from " Friends " and Tom Green is REALLY annoying as Barrymore's boyfriend . Only Cameron Diaz gives out a good performance - - she's so lively and fun . Also Luke Wilson is very good as her boyfriend . Those two have great chemistry together . So , I gave the film a 4 only for Diaz , Wilson and some good fight scenes . Otherwise , this is a mess .
477442	463200	60877	4.0	Loved it as a kid	When I was growing up ( late 70s ) a local TV station used to show this constantly on Saturday afternoons along with other AIP horror movies . I liked it back then . . . the vampire woman spooked me and the " attack " sequences gave me nightmares . Seeing it now as an adult it , unfortunately , doesn't age well . The print I saw was brand-new so it looked good - - that helped a lot . The vampire woman is still spooky ( what an evil little smile ! ) and there are plenty of eerie scenes . But the film is punishingly slow and dull . . . I was fast forwarding through most of it . The only saving graces were good performances from the whole cast - - especially Basil Rathbone , John Saxon and Florence Marley . Also some of the special effects ( stolen from a big budget Russian sci-fi film ) are great . Neat ending too . And who ever knew Dennis Hopper was that young ? : ) Still , it's slow going and there are much better films to be seen . Skip it .
477613	463200	35703	4.0	I didn't like it	Spiritual ( I guess ) tale of a man named " Little Joe " ( Eddie " Rochester " Anderson ) who is saved from the Devil by the prayers of his wife . But the Devil's son ( Rex Ingram ) has 60 days or something to get him back . Sorry about the confusing synopsis . . . but I had trouble staying awake through this . I was VERY bored and it's beyond me why this is considered a great musical . For starters , the story is just silly and the script is pretty bad . Also the acting is bad . Ethel Waters OVERacts all over the place ; Anderson's idea of acting is bugging out his eyes ( I got tired of it after the 20th time ) ; Lena Horne is given nothing to do and most of the other actors either underact or overact . Only Rex Ingram and Kenneth Spencer give out decent performances . As for the songs - - I didn't enjoy one of them . Not one . And what's all this about Waters ' being such a great singer ? Her voice was OK - - that's all . . . and Anderson's singing was downright painful . Only Horne really put a little life into her numbers . And the " dancing " - - it was good in the pool hall sequence , but there's a tap dance bit in Little Joe and Petunia's kitchen that was SO bad and clumsy that I couldn't believe it stayed in the film . And it is VERY racist . Some people can ignore it but I couldn't . Actually , after 70 minutes , I turned it off . I was bored and sick and tired of the overacting and lousy script . I give this a 4 because of Horne and Minnelli's direction . Aside from that I hated this film .
477939	463200	102299	4.0	Prententious , pretentious , pretentious	Nick ( Kevin Anderson ) goes back to his hometown to take care of his dying mother ( Kim Novak ) . There he encounters an old college buddy ( Bill Pullman ) and his beautiful wife ( Pamela Gidley ) . He also gets involved with a 40 year old sex murder that may have something to do with him . . . I caught this in a theatre back in 1991 . It was part of the Boston Film Festival and I had heard it had some incredibly beautiful cinematography . Well - - it does . It just doesn't have much of a story to go with it . Also the film moves so SLOWLY - - I literally fell asleep ! Seeing it again 14 years later , I fell asleep AGAIN ! This film is dull and slow . It's one of those art films full of strange characters who act oddly and mutter obscure dialogue ( especially the police chief ) . Gorgeous images don't make up for the leaden pace . Acting doesn't help . Anderson ( a good actor ) acts terrible here . He appears to be drugged out at all times . Gidley TRIES to give a good performance but she's given nothing to work with . Pullman is the only one who pulls off a good job . Novak is ( sadly ) wasted and reduced to being bed ridden and screaming for no good reason . Also watch the part where the police chief has the longest urination sequence in cinema history . Why it's there I have no idea but at least it's somewhat funny . Otherwise this is a dull , slow-moving bore . Avoid .
478399	463200	300556	4.0	Big , loud , noisy . . . and dull	Silly time travel movie . A archaeologist ( somehow ) finds a " wormhole " to 1347 France . That's when there was a huge battle ( or something . . . history isn't my best subject ) . He goes back to get artifacts . . . and never returns . So his stupid son ( Paul Walker ) and friends ( Gerard Butler , Frances O'Connor and some others who are just there to get killed ) travel back to find him . Naturally everything goes wrong and they may be stuck there for good . What's wrong with this movie ? Just about everything . The script is REAL stupid . . . full of implausible situations and characters and some truly jaw-dropping twists and turns . Aside from the dubious " science " I find it hard to believe a bunch of people from 2003 could even remotely understand French from 1347 . Yet they have no trouble talking here . The stupidest subplot ( and that's saying a bit ) has Butler's character falling in love ( very quickly ) with a French lady who he knows will be killed . Oh , the irony ( sarcasm ) ! There are tons of explosions and fights to keep the audience awake . It all ends with a big huge battle which LOOKS expensive but I was bored silly . There's also lots of casual violence and killings in the movie - - but there's never any blood so that makes it OK for a PG-13 rating . As for the acting - - Paul Walker ( the " star " ) is VERY handsome with a nice body but simply can't act - - at ALL ! His blank stare ( flashing his big baby blue eyes ) quickly becomes annoying . I was SO hoping he would get killed . He makes Keanu Reeves look like an accomplished actor . The rest of the cast either overacts ( Butler and O'Connor ) , underacts ( Billy Connolly ) or just have this pained look on their faces ( understandable ) . The biggest surprise was Gerard Butler being so bad . He's been very good in other movies . This was a HUGE box office bomb - - it's easy to see why . Purportedly if you're a scientist or a history major this is hysterically funny . Otherwise stay away . I give it a 4 .
478290	463200	325214	5.0	Average creature feature	Back in the 1800s an miner finds tons of gold and refuses to share it . Instead he hides it and kills everybody he thinks it interested in it . He's shot but curses anyone who finds his gold and then . . . disappears . Cut to present day ( well . . . 2003 actually ) . A young guy finds some gold . The miner immediately comes to life and kills him . His friends come looking for him . They're the usual horror movie clichés - - three couples all stock characters . The women : one's a bitch , another is a slut , the last is good girl with NO personality ( meaning she'll live ) . The guys : one's a whiner with REAL greasy hair , another is a sexist jerk and the last is a nice guy with NO personality ( he'll live ) . They find the gold and the miner comes after them . That's about the whole plot . Also pros like Karen Black , John Phillip Law and Martin Kove show up VERY briefly to give the movie some much needed class . Actually this movie isn't that bad . The actors are all pretty good , the script is OK , the makeup on the miner is actually pretty scary and there are a few nice gory deaths . Only real complaints : did we REALLY need the supposedly " comic " scene where a guy takes a dump in the woods and the ending is just silly . All in all an average by the numbers horror movie but not bad OF ITS TYPE . I give it a 5 .
479482	463200	61398	5.0	Joan Crawford's 2nd to last film - - a true horror	Monica Rivers ( Joan Crawford ) is the owner of a traveling circus . One night the tightrope walker's rope breaks . He falls and ( somewhat impossibly ) is hung by his own rope . The next day Frank Hawkins ( Ty Hardin ) shows up looking for a job - - and he just happens to be a tightrope walker . Rivers hires him . . . and almost immediately begins romancing him ! But then a bunch of gory murders begin happening . Michael Gough gets a spike through the head - - Diana Dors is cut in half and there's a real surprising killing at the end . This is pretty awful . The murders themselves are pretty well-done but that's about it . By today's standards they're not that violent but were really pretty strong for 1968 . Most of the film is padding - - endless circus acts and pointless , uninteresting material detailing the personal lives of ther performers . Also seeing 64 year old Crawford romancing 38 year old Hardin is kind of scary . And Crawford ( looking pretty good considering ) has many needless dramatic scenes and she overacts all the way . Hardin is very handsome but can't act . Diana Dors does what she can with the miserable sex pot role she was given . Even Michael Gough was bad . Only Judy Geeson gives a halfway interesting performance . And the revelation of the killer at the end is ludicrous . If you think about it , it was impossible for the killer to even perform two of the killings ! Boring , stupid with only a few nice bloody killings to liven it up - - but they're few and far between . A real come down for Crawford . Skip it .
477534	463200	105219	5.0	OK action flick	I only saw this because the late Brandon Lee was in it . His acting was so good in " The Crow " , I wondered how he was before that . Sadly , not that good . He was a very handsome man with a beautiful body ( nice butt too ) , but his acting is pretty stiff . He's not horrible just not good . I guess between this and " The Crow " he learned a lot . The film itself is OK - - typical fare . The scenes where Lee uses martial arts are impressive and the acting is pretty good by everybody else . So an OK action flick - - it'll probably only be remembered as the second to last film Lee made before his tragic death .
479024	463200	303816	5.0	Unpleasant , bloody and boring	Five extremely annoying college students decide to spend a weekend in a cabin in the woods . They're attacked ( sort of ) by a man infected by a flesh-eating virus . He's killed but not before infecting them and they start to unravel as they battle the virus . . . and themselves . The plot is totally by the numbers and the dialogue is just OK , but there are passages of jaw-droppingly stupid lines . There is one horrendous sequence in which they meet a " partying " sheriff who is stupid and annoying , and says things that no human being would ever say with a straight face . Also we're never told where the virus came from . I suppose that's supposed to make it scarier but I just found it annoying . The special effects are very good but downright sickening . Seeing a bunch of young kids having their flesh peel off or spitting out blood is not my idea of entertainment . And you know next to nothing about these kids - - how can you care that they're dying when you don't know a thing about them ? The only things that make this bearable is some nice wide-screen photography , a very good score and some pretty good acting . Paul ( Rider Storm ) plays the good guy - - he gives a good performance but his goody-goody nature got on my nerves . Karen ( Jordan Ladd ) is very good but given next to nothing to work with . Jeff ( Joey Kern ) is terrible but he's not in the film enough to destroy it . Bert ( James DeBello ) is the - - sigh - - beer-swilling , stupid , dumb , sexist " comic " relief - - definetely one of the most disposable characters . Best of all is Marcy ( Cerina Vincent ) . She's strong , intelligent and sexy . Her performance was dead on target . But mostly the film either disgusts you with the special effects or bores you with the totally predictable story line - - one characters demise was so telegraphed and predictable I seriously thought they were kidding . Inexplicably this has been getting good reviews from horror fans . Well . . as a HUGE horror fan I can say don't go ! I give it a 4 .
477294	463200	175526	5.0	Badly cut and doesn't work	In the small town of Cherry Falls VA , a vicious killer starts hacking up teenagers . The thing is he only attacks virgins ! The town sheriff ( Michael Biehn ) tries to warn parents and teenagers and also protect his own teenage daughter ( Brittany Murphy ) . The movie tries to mix black humor with strong violence . While it has its moments it ultimately doesn't work . The humor isn't very funny at all - - most of the jokes are real groaners . To make things worse , every character in the school is quirky and strange in purportedly interesting ways . This was a BAD idea . There's not one normal likable character to latch on to or identify with . To make matters worse , all the adults come off as complete idiots . Also this film went through some huge edits by the stupid MPAA . The violence was cut down to next to nothing . One girls death which originally ran for 5 minutes ( ! ! ! ) now lasts about 20 seconds . And a massacre sequence at the end is virtually gone . That's too bad because the stalking and attacking scenes ( what's left of them ) are actually pretty scary . Dumb censors ! And the revelation of who the killer is was REALLY REALLY dumb ! Most of the acting is very good . Murphy is convincing in her role and she has strong support from Natalie Ramsey ( her best friend ) , Douglas Spain ( a very convincing stoner ) and Kristen Miller ( her talk about sex with other high school girls is a definite highlight ) . Unfortunately we have Gabriel Mann ( playing Murphy's boyfriend ) who looks about 30 ! Jay Mohr is downright horrible as a school teacher and even Biehn is bad ! That's surprising because Biehn is a very good , talented actor - - what happened here ? Candy Clark does have a few cute scenes as Murphy's mom . Also , as an added " bonus " , one of the worst music score in memory . It's too bad . . . this has a real original idea but just doesn't know what to do with it . Avoid .
478801	463200	194776	5.0	Saw it in college in 1980	This was actually shown as part of a psychology class I took in college in 1980 . It was used to demonstrate the stages of sex among couples ( male / female ) . To be honest it was hardly exciting . The women were , to put it bluntly , not good-looking and the guys weren't much better . No plot or story - - just sex . It was made on next to no budget ( it shows ) and was actually interesting in a psychological sense . It DOES show the stages couples go through in a sexual relationship and the film was hardcore but not in an offensive way . Also the on screen couples seem to be enjoying themselves . So it's OK to see for psychology only . A few of the actors went on to pretty successful porn careers .
477275	463200	69715	5.0	Plodding but has its moments	This takes places in 1795 England . Young Catherine ( Stephanie Beacham ) marries Charles Fengiffen ( Ian Ogilvy ) and moves to live with him at his remote ancestral estate . She's attacked by a spirit on her wedding night , starts seeing an eyeless grinning man and a disembodied hand crawling around . Is she going mad or is there some family curse ? Sounds good but this turns out to be a dreary , slow-moving horror movie . The drama drags along and seems longer than it's 90 minutes . It's also horribly edited with scenes ending just when they're starting to get interesting . Ogilvy and Beacham are pretty bad but the script does them no favors . Even old pros like Herbert Lom , Peter Cushing and Patrick Magee seem bored in supporting roles . However this does have a few things going for it . There's some incredibly beautiful art direction and nice cinematography . Also the ending does work . Worth a look for horror fans . I give it a 5 .
479701	463200	245562	5.0	Boring and clichéd	In WWII Navajo men were used as code talkers in the war - - they translated messages while in combat into their own language , and transmitted it that way . This was done so the Japanese were unable to understand the messages . It's a very interesting little known fact about the war . It's a good thing they made a movie about it - - it's too bad the movie is so lousy . SPOILERSEvery single clichéd line and character found in WWII movies are all here . There's the sergeant who is suffering from a former war trauma ; the eager young kid ( who you know is gonna get it ) ; the racist ( who sees the error of his ways ) ; the nice guy who is horrified by what he sees ; the saint-like Navajos etc etc . The dialogue is astonishingly bad . I've heard these same lines from other war flicks - - some of them are lifted verbatim ( it seems ) ! Every single line and conflict is predictable . I was able to tell in the first 20 minutes who was going to die - - that's how predictable this is ! I almost left but the movie DOES have it's good points . For one thing , war is not glorified . The battle sequences are bloody , loud , very graphic and upsetting . . . as they should be . However , director John Woo has always been good at shooting violence . Also there's no stupid obligatory romance - - heck , there's virtually no females here ! There's some good acting also - - Adam Beach as one of the Navajos is fantastic - - handsome , intelligent if a little too saintlike . Mark Ruffalo is also affecting and Christian Slater ( not playing a jerk for once ) is excellent . Unfortunately , Nicholas Cage gives another lousy performance as the main character . Can we take back the Oscar he got for " Leaving Las Vegas " ? So , aside from some good acting and extreme violence ( be warned . . . it's VERY explicit . . . some people walked out because of it ) , I can't recommend this . Too bad . . . the subject matter is so interesting .
479267	463200	9968	5.0	Dated and overdone	A kind Chinese man ( Richard Barthelmess - - who's white ) travels from China to London to teach peace and kindness to white men . Years later he lives in the Limehouse section of London - - a real slum . He's depressed but not beaten down . He meets sweet , innocent Lucy ( Lillian Gish ) who is beaten and whipped by her cruel father ( Donald Crisp ) . She finds friendship with Barthlemess - - but her evil , racist father might find out . . . For 1919 this must have been pretty racy . Even suggesting a friendship between a Chinese man and a white girl was pretty extreme . Today it's laughably dated and WAY overdone . It's also racist in itself - - Barthelmess plays a Chinese man and is constantly referred to as " the Yellow Man " in the title cards . Still , for its era , this was pretty brave . Also this is , for director D . W . Griffith , a small quiet film - - he was used to doing epics . It is well-directed and the color filters help . Gish overacts a LOT as does Crisp - - they're hard to take seriously . Barthelmess , on the other hand , underacts like he's afraid to show any emotion . So , for its time , it's daring but it just doesn't hold up . I give it a 5 .
479001	463200	244970	6.0	Predictable but fun	A woman , Jane ( Ashley Judd ) falls in love with an executive ( Greg Kinnear ) at work . She plans to move in with him , gives up her apartment . . . and he dumps her . She reluctantly moves in with hunky , womanizing co-worker Eddie ( Hugh Jackman ) who she hates . Naturally , they fall in love . Utterly predictable from first frame to last , but I enjoyed it . The script was OK and there are plenty of good performances . Judd and Jackman are both sexy and funny , and we're treated to a sequence when they're both in nothing but underwear ( so we can admire their buff bodies ) . Kinnear has played this louse role once too often - - he looks miserable too . Ellen Barkin and Marisa Tomei , however , are very good in supporting roles . So , you always know what's coming , but Judd and beautiful Jackman ( what a face and bod ! ) make this worth watching .
479338	463200	462359	6.0	The title is wrong but this is OK	A bunch of 20 somethings are going camping in the Bitteroot Mountains , Montana . However their car overturns ( not shown - - this is VERY low budget ) . They all try to get to the road but come upon a huge concrete structure . They get in to get help . . . but find dead bloody bodies and something stalking them . . . The reviews for this have ranged from some saying this is one of the worst movies ever made to others who love it . I'm somewhere in the middle . It's not good but it's hardly the worst horror movie ever . Let's deal with the bad things first . Fot starters - - the title is wrong . An incubus is a demon that comes to you in your nightmares . That's NOT what this is about . SPOILER ! ! ! ! It's about a madman who uses his thoughts to take over your body ( when you fall asleep ) and force you to kill . That's about possession - - not a demon . END SPOILER ! ! ! The cast has no personalities and are pretty interchangeable . The plot is pretty run of the mill too with that stupid " it's not over " ending . On the plus side it's pretty well-made , the acting actually isn't bad ( top billed Tara Reid is good ) , the cast are all attractive ( especially Russell Carter as Josh ) and there's some explicit bloody gore . For the record there's no nudity in this one at all . So - - all in all - - a pretty good horror film with some decent gore and a capable cast . I was never bored which isn't something I can say for most recent horror films . I give it a 6 .
479395	463200	338348	6.0	Kids will like it	A young boy doesn't believe in Santa Claus at all . On Christmas Eve a huge , magical locomotive pulls in front of his house . The conductor ( Tom Hanks ) tells him to get on - - they're going to the North Pole . It seems the train is full of kids who don't believe in Santa . Well . . . that's about to change . This is not a live action film . The characters look like humans ( Tom Hanks has FIVE roles ) and sound like them but are clearly computer-generated . In fact the whole movie is like that - - EVERYTHING is computer generated . I saw it in an IMAX 3D theatre . I admit the visuals were incredible ( if somewhat creepy ) - - - but I really didn't like it . There's very little plot , no characterization and I was basically bored silly . The " adventures " on the express didn't impress me and there's a pointlessly long episode with three of the kids lost in Santa's town ( or whatever - - we're never told what it is ) . Tons of characters and situations are left unexplored or unexplained and it gets annoying . The waiters on the train serving hot chocolate had me going " huh " ? Also the meaning of the film ( believe in Christmas ) is heavy-handed even for a kids movie . They go out of their way to make you cry and choke up - - - I found it overly manipulative . Basically you just sit there and are bombarded by tons of visual tricks . For some people , that's enough . For me I needed more . The actors voicing the figures do pretty good except for Eddie Deezen - - his voice is INCREDIBLY annoying ( as is his character ) . So I didn't like it - - I looked at my watch more than once . Still the kids in the theatre were spellbound - - they sat there in silence watching the screen . So - - I think kids will like it but , to be honest , I think some kids might get nightmares from this . These CGI characters look so strange . More than once I was feeling very uneasy looking at them . Adults MIGHT enjoy it . I give it a 6 - - and that's mostly for the visuals .
478307	463200	39377	6.0	Silly but OK	Movie designed to introduce Ricardo Montalban to American audiences . It's a drama - - NOT a musical . There are a few musical numbers but that's it . This takes place in Mexico and has Montalban and Esther Williams playing twins . No - - I'm not kidding ! If you can swallow that you might like this . Their father is a great bullfighter and expects his son to be the same . However his son Mario ( Mantalban ) wants be a musician . His sister Maria ( Williams ) is better at bullfighting then him . You can probably guess the rest . EXTREME PLOT SPOILER IN THIS PARAGRAPH ! ! ! Pretty forgettable as a drama . The situations are just silly , the dialogue pedestrian and you just KNOW how this is going to end . Also Williams isn't much of a dramatic actress . This film could have ended after an hour but this drags it out and gets REAL stupid during the second act . Williams has to bullfight in place of her brother - - but nobody notices the difference ! Seriously - - everybody thought Williams was her brother ? ? ? ? Even for a 1940s movie that's pushing it . Still it's not completely terrible . It's done with the usual MGM gloss and is shot in bright Technicolor . Montalban , Williams and Cyd Charisse are so young and beautiful and so full of life that it rubs off on the audience . The dance sequences with Montalban and Charisse are just incredible - - I never knew he could dance ! Williams even has a ( brief ) swimming scene . There's also some good acting from Akim Taminoff as Chato and Mary Astor as Williams and Montalbans mother . So it's silly but enjoyable as a no brainer . The dancing scenes alone make this worth seeing . I give it a 6 .
477728	463200	416315	6.0	It's OK - - that's about it	Purportedly based on fact story set in Australia in 1999 . Three likable 20 somethings - - Ben ( Nathan Phillips ) , Liz ( Cassandra Magarth ) and Kristy ( Kertie Morassi ) - - go to Wolf Creek . It's a remote part of Australia where a meteor had landed . The car breaks down and they're stuck in the middle of nowhere . Then , after dark , a local man shows up and says he'll help them . . . and then the nightmare begins . I can't understand why there's so much hype surrounding this . It IS gory and brutal . . . but nothing special . I've seen this story before and saying it's based on real events doesn't make it anymore different . It's a little - - only a LITTLbetter than similar American horror flicks . It's done with the same shaky camera-work and washed out color - - but it DOES have three characters you actually like and who have personalities , unlike the cardboard cutouts that most American horror films have . It works in the films favor because when the violence starts it really is hard to watch . You actually like and know these people - - seeing them tortured is horrifying . The film one fatal flaw is it takes a full hour before anything happens - - everything in that first hour is just the three main people talking and interacting . I have nothing against character development - - but a full HOUR ? ? ? They're all pretty good in their roles so that makes it somewhat interesting . Phillips is very handsome , buff and cheerful as Ben - - Magarth is strong , intelligent and completely convincing - - Morassi unfortunately is given the victim role so she has little to do but scream and whimper . By the time everything kicked in I was more than ready for it . Be warned the violence is STRONG and incredibly bloody - - three people walk out when I went to see it . So it's OK - - but nothing great or groundbreaking . I give this a marginal recommendation to horror fans - - all others stay away .
478055	463200	90223	6.0	Well acted but ridiculously predictable	Harry MacKenzie ( Gene Hackman ) leaves wife Kate ( Ellen Burstyn ) for waitress Audrey Minelli ( Ann-Margret ) . This causes huge complications with his adult children Sunny ( Amy Madigan ) and Helen ( Ally Sheedy ) . Stephen Lang and Brian Dennehy throw in strong supporting performances . This is well made and everything . . . but this has been done to death before and this adds nothing new . Aside from some swearing ( the R rating for this is not deserved ) this plays like a made for TV movie . I knew what was coming constantly all through the movie and quickly tired of it . It doesn't even have a conclusion ! It just sort of stops . ( One of my friends said , " I can't say if I like it or not until I see the end ! " ) All the acting was great - - especially Burstyn , Ann-Margret and Madigan ( she was Oscar nominated for this one ) but all the great acting in the world can't overcome the predictable storyline . If you're a sucker for Lifetime movies or predictable family dramas this is right up your alley . This came and went quickly in 1985 and is now ( rightfully ) forgotten . I believe Ann-Margret was asked about this a few years back in an interview and she couldn't remember doing it ! That should tell you something . I give it a 6 .
479677	463200	86873	6.0	Martin and Tomlin are great . The movie isn't .	Rich and dying Edwina Cutwater ( Lily Tomlin ) is arranging to have her soul transferred into the body of a young beautiful woman ( Victoria Tennant ) just after she dies . Instead it gets sent to the body of stuffy lawyer Roger Cobb ( Steve Martin ) and both of them fight to gain control . This is not a great movie by any means . It's really not all that funny ; it's flatly directed by Carl Reiner ; Tennant is terrible at comedy ; there's some highly unlikely situations ( especially at the end ) and I didn't buy what happened to the main villain at the climax for one second . Still , Martin and Tomlin make this worth seeing . Tomlin technically isn't in it that much . After she dies ( early on in the film ) you only see her as a reflection whenever Martin looks in a mirror or glass surface . It's a credit to her acting that you think of her even when she's not on screen . Martin had a VERY difficult role . He had to show male AND female characteristics in the same body at the same time . It's tricky but he manages to pull it off and he's actually pretty hysterical . Even people who hate this movie agree his performance is just incredible . There's a courtroom sequence at the end where he's just magnificent . The fact that he wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award for this is a crime ( although he DID win a Golden Globe ) . Don't miss the dance sequence during the closing credits . So , all in all , the movie has some great moments but doesn't really pull together . Worth seeing for just Matin and Tomlin . I truthfully can only give this a 6 .
477656	463200	67580	6.0	More funny than anything else	Totally plot less movie of the homo erotic images of some hot young guy . I caught this years ago at an art cinema as part of their gay and lesbian film festival . It's safe to say the entire audience consisted of gay men . When it started there was silence . . . which mostly continued throughout the movie . Some people walked out and there was scattered laughter during some of the sillier scenes . The color was bright ( and blinding ) and the print we had was in good shape but with no plot or point ( that I could see of ) this quickly became boring . The guy in it was handsome and hot ( and nude some of the time ) but that wasn't enough to keep me interested for 90 minutes . Maybe back in 1971 this was considered erotic and shocking but it sure isn't today ( although it would still get an NC-17 ) . Pretentious , pointless and overdone . It gets a 6 for some truly striking and beautiful images but I can't recommend it . When it was over at the art cinema most of the guys left complaining how stupid and boring it was . That should tell you something .
479582	463200	285531	6.0	So-so	Plot heavy - - TOO heavy - - horror sci-fi film about 4 friends ( Thomas Jane , Jason Lee , Timothy Olyphant , Damian Lewis ) in the Maine woods squaring off against disgusting killer aliens and the Army led by Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore . The film is well-directed by Lawrence Kasdan and well-acted ( especially by Jane , Lewis and Olyphant ) but there's too many plots going on and the movie rambles on for 135 minutes . I did sit through the whole thing , but I was never really involved or interested . On the plus side , the special effects are great ; the aliens are slimy and disgusting ; the attack scenes are brutal ( and bloody ) and I LOVED the way Kasdan visualized Lewis ' mind . Still , the film has too many plots to handle and it's constantly loosing its focus . Not terrible or unwatchable , just disappointing . I give it a 6 .
478587	463200	56417	7.0	My first " Road " picture	This is actually the first Cosby / Hope " Road " picture I ever saw . I knew it was the last ( after a 10 year break ) and ( for some reason ) was in b & w - - probably because Cosby and Hope looked better that way . I also heard it was pretty bad . While it's not great , I sort of enjoyed it . The plot was REALLY silly and involves the boys in espionage with Joan Collins along for the ride and a ( surprisingly ) very bad job by Robert Morley as the lead villain . Dorothy Lamour decided to not costar in this one but she does pop up ( playing herself ) in an amusing cameo and sings one song ( Cosby sings too ) . There's also a really silly and pointless bit when Cosby and Hope are sent to outer space . And the ending is desperate . Still , it was well-made and Cosby and Hope were a wonderful team - - their easy banter is great to watch and they made the worst lines seem funny . Also it's fun to see Collins ( who's quite good ) so young and full of sex appeal . So , it's enjoyable way to kill 90 minutes . I'm seen better but I've seen worse too .
477515	463200	65063	7.0	Good Woody Allen comedy	This is Woody Allen's first movie as a writer and director and unlike any other of his comedies . It doesn't open silently with the main titles in white on a black screen and it doesn't have his standard use of old music . No drama either . It's basically just a mocumentary ( complete with narration and interviews ) about the life of criminal Virgil Starkwell ( Allen ) . It chronicles how he started his life of crime , met and fell in love with Louise ( Janet Margolin ) and can't seem to stop being a criminal . This was considered a comedy classic when it came out . Today it's kind of weak . Some of the jokes work but there are a large number that don't . The jokes are also pretty silly for a Woody Allen film and it just drags along . This isn't a total bomb - - it just isn't as funny as you would expect from an early Allen film . Also , surprisingly , Allen doesn't play a Jewish guy here ! That's probably the first ( and last ) time he did that . It's OK but you can safely skip this one .
477880	463200	78288	7.0	Not that good but it works	Stefano ( Lino Capolicchio ) goes to Venice to visit his brother - - priest Don Paolo ( Craig Hill ) . While there certain people are being murdered for no rhyme or reason . Also Don Paolo is getting letters threatening his life . Plot wise there's nothing new here . You've seen these characters ( and situations ) in giallos of the past . Also Capolicchio and Stefania Casini ( playing his blank girlfriend Sandra ) are pretty terrible actors . We're supposed to identify with them but they don't come across at all . And , of course , there's the obligatory pointless sex scene and a long trip through the canals that leads to nothing . Still this works . The cinematography here is just great - - virtually every shot here takes your breath away . Hill is very good as Don Paolo - - more of him could only have helped the movie . There's also a great score by the group Goblin - - almost as good as the one for " Suspiria " . The ending is effective too . So - - it's no great shakes but you could do worse . See a wide screen print . I give it a 7 .
478364	463200	160484	7.0	Not as bad as I heard	What's the problem ? This film is no classic , but it's not the disaster critics have been calling it . WARNING : Possible spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! Winona Ryder discovers that Ben Chaplin will play host to the Devil , become the Anitchrist and take over the world . Can it be stopped . . . and how ? This is a very odd horror film for 2000 - - there's next to no blood , no gore , no extreme violence and only a few well-placed shocks . ( How it got the R rating is beyond me ) . It's easy to see why New Line didn't release it for a year - - it's not a typical horror movie . What it is , is very well-made , creepy , exceptionally well-directed ( by Janusz Kaminski ) and a great performance by Winona Ryder . The film isn't perfect - - it's sometimes hard to follow , the ( purposely ) grainy and drained of color look of the film wears on you and Chaplin gives out a pretty bad performance . He's stated in interviews that he didn't want to do the movie - - he only did it because Ryder asked him . Unfortunately , his reluctance shows . Still , the movie is a near-perfect example of quiet horror - - it creeps up on you slowly and leads to a downbeat ( in a way ) conclusion . Again , why are people saying the ending was so stupid ? I thought it ended perfectly ! So , it's no classic but not a disaster . I gave it a 7 . Worth catching .
477297	463200	56700	7.0	Must be seen in the Cinerama format	Fictionalized ( ? ) account of the brothers Grimm ( Laurence Harvey and Karl Boehm ) - - their lives and loves . Three of their fairy tales are dramatized . " The Dancing Princess " stars Russ Tamblyn , Jim Backus and Yvette Mimieux . It's cute but there's a dance sequence that goes on much too long . However there is a long coach ride which makes full use of the three screens in Cinerama and provides some fantastic scenery ( even on TV ) . " The Cobbler and the Elves " stars Harvey and includes a little Puppetoon ( stop motion animation ) sequence . It's OK for the kids . " The Singing Bone " has Terry-Thomas and Buddy Hackett fighting a very bad stop-motion animation dragon . As with the first two , it will appeal to kids . This film must be seen in the Cinerama format - - that was a short-lived process in which three screens were used to project a full picture along with three projectors running . The triple screens are used effectively all throughout the film - - I can't imagine this working in a pan & scan format . Luckily , Turner Classic Movies always shows it in that format . It's perfect family entertainment except for a few minor quibbles - - at 129 minutes it's a bit too long ; there are too many ( bad ) songs ; the dances could be cut and the stop-motion animation is stunningly bad . Still , it's beautiful to look at , the cast is very good ( except for Boehm ) and the whole picture has a playful quality about it . Also I've never seen Laurence Harvey so animated and full of life ! Worth catching - - in wide screen only .
479113	463200	151738	7.0	For Drew Barrymore fans	A VERY predictable story ( girl who was an ugly duckling goes back to high school undercover years later , meets and falls in love with her high school sweetheart . . . ) done pretty well . You're always two steps ahead of the plot , but it's pretty well-acted ( with the sole exception of David Arquette - - God , is he annoying ) and never really dull . But it's a great movie if you're a Drew Barrymore fan ( like me ) . She gives out a terrific performance and makes her character warm and believable . My only big complaint is the ending . The movie should have wrapped up everything at the prom - - the ending at Shea Stadium was VERY anticlimatic . That aside though , I enjoyed it .
479146	463200	118275	7.0	Not great but I liked it	A pretty good cop show by Steven Bochco . It got a lot of controversy at the time because the pilot show had ( for TV ) a pretty graphic scene where a man gets shot in the head . It started out with fairly good ratings but slowly sank till it was canceled . It was was no masterpiece but people kept comparing it to " NYPD Blue " which was a better show - - there was no way they could compete . Still it was well-acted and written - - I especially liked Jon Tenney as one of the main characters . Towards the end ( in a desperate attempt to get higher ratings ) they had an episode where Tenney showed his butt and publicized it a LOT . Unfortunately it didn't save the show . So , a pretty good show that deserved a better chance .
478500	463200	17739	7.0	Creaky but somewhat fun silent film	An old man ( Cyrus West ) dies accusing his relatives of hovering over him - - like cats over a canary . 20 years after his death his relatives get together as his will is read in his creepy mansion on a dark and windy night at midnight ( of course ) . One person gets all the money and estate - - unless they are proved insane . And how about the escaped lunatic from the nearby asylum . . . ? This is probably one of the first ( if not THE first ) movie about the reading of the will , a dark and ( purportedly ) haunted house and people being murdered . Plotwise it's nothing new and contains some terribly unfunny " comedy " . Still it's worth catching . It's very well directed by Paul Leni ( the juxtaposing of images was clever ) and he has fun with the title cards ( see how " HELP ! " is done ) . The acting is a little bit overdone ( but that's common in silent films ) and star Laura La Plante is pretty good . I saw the restored print ( which is still in pretty bad shape ) and it has an excellent music score that helps too . So , worth catching . No great shakes though .
477329	463200	70334	7.0	Strange and quirky doesn't even begin to cover this one	Phillip Marlowe ( Elliott Gould ) is a washed out private investigator in California . One night old friend Terry Lennox ( Jim Bouton ) asks for a quick ride to Tijuana . Marlowe agrees then gets caught up in a VERY complex plot involving sexy Nina van Pallandt , alcoholic Sterling Hayden and violent hood Mary Rydell . The plot is WAY too complicated to get into . Odd take by Robert Altman on Phillip Marlowe . He changes the story drastically . He moves it from the 1940s to the 1970s - - yet Marlowe dresses like the 40s and even drives a 40s car . He is rumpled , mumbling and run-down here . There's a security guard who does celebrity impersonations ( for no reason ) . Everybody talks strangely and the complex plot moves VERY quickly . It's never dull and it's beautifully directed . . . but I'm not quite sure what Altman's point is here . On one hand he seems to be doing a straight-forward ( albeit a little strange ) detective story - - on the other he seems to be making fun of Marlowe and his attempts . The tone of the film wavers uncomfortably between humor , violence and satire . I'm still not quite sure how to take this . The acting is great - - Gould is just wonderful - - probably his best performance ever ; van Pallandt is also very good ( interesting costumes - - VERY 70s ) ; Hayden yells and screams a lot ; Rydell is downright terrifying as a crime lord . Since it an Altman film there's pointless female nudity ( Marlowe's neighbors ) and a sick scene where a Coke bottle is smashed across a woman's face . It's also highly unbelievable - - no Coke bottle would break that easy . Also David Carradine and Arnold Schwarzenegger pop up in cameos ! A VERY odd movie and ( understandably ) a commercial failure but it's acquired a cult following . I'm not quite sure WHAT it's saying - - but I liked it - - sort of . I give it a 7 .
477711	463200	77952	7.0	Enjoyable	Fun parody of 30s movies showing two " movies " ( they're actually only 50 minutes each ) done by Warren Bros . ( ha ha ) The first is " Dynamite Hands " with Harry Hamlin ( so young and full of life ) playing a boxer to save money to . . . well , the plot is familar . . . VERY familar . Every single boxing movie cliche is hit head on with sledgehammer subtlety and the dialogue is way over the top . It's not half as clever as it thinks it is but it still works . It's quick and so energetic it's impossible to dislike . Also Hamlin is obviously enjoying himself . George C . Scott ( who's in both ) is in it briefly and Red Buttons ( also in both ) lends strong support . It was in black and white up the theatres in 1978 , but it's in color on cable . Why ? " Baxter's Beauties of 1933 " is a parody of those big , splashy colorful musicals . The plot is basically a combination of every cliche from musicals back then . Barry Bostwick is in it and he's just " swell " as a Dick Powell type and Rebecca York is just great as a Ruby Keeler type . The music and lyrics are just OK but this is lots of fun - - beautiful sets , great singing and dancing , impressive production numbers and full of fun . As said before , George C . Scott is in both but is ( surprisingly ) bad - - he looks bored and unsure of his lines . Buttons is great in both but Trish Van Devere is just terrible . She's very good-looking but a horrible actress . No great film but worth catching - - a must for movie buffs .
478819	463200	963794	7.0	Good but not great	A bunch of college kids ( Jonathan Tucker , Jena Malone , Shawn Ashmore and Laura Ramsey ) are on vacation in Mexico . They meet a friendly German man ( Joe Anderson ) who offers to take them to a Mayan temple that nobody else knows about . They go . . . but soon find themselves in terrible danger . SPOILER ! ! ! The vines covering the temple are alive - - and eat people ! ! ! END SPOILER This is about 70 % better than most of the horror films we've been getting . It has characters we know and care about ; it doesn't have any of those stupid ' jump ' scares that every horror film today seems to have ; it has next to no nudity ( only very briefly ) and it doesn't rub gore in our faces . This movie has only two really gory scenes - - and more is heard than seen . That , of course , makes it even harder to watch . I was literally cringing in my seat during these scene and it takes a LOT to get to me ! With the sole exception of Tucker ( he was WAY too calm ) the acting is very good , the script has people reacting exactly how people might react in this situation and it's very well-directed . My only complaints are that this movie is a good one hour movie stretched out to 90 minutes . Sometimes it does get a little dull . Also it's never explained exactly WHY the vines are doing that . And how about those people who won't let them leave the temple ? Why did they let them get there in the first place ? So these questions kept nagging me and somewhat lessen the film . Still this is a good strong horror film . I give it a 7 .
477349	463200	69895	7.0	Has its moments	A small town in Pennsylvania is accidentally infected with a virus the army has developed to use as a weapon . It causes its victims to go insane . The army arrives in town to contain the virus but its already infected some people . . . and things go barreling out of control . OK Romero film - - it was his first horror film after " Night of the Living Dead " . It isn't as good as that . . . but how could it be ? This is well-directed and has some nice bloody moments . . . but it doesn't work too well . The basic problem is some of the writing and acting . Some of the dramatic scenes are pretty poorly written and some of the actors are really really BAD ! Some are just OK - - Will MacMillan ( as David ) and Richard France ( as Dr . Watts ) come off best . All in all its an OK time filler . This was a commercial bomb when released although critics liked it . It finally got its audience on home video . I give it a 7 .
479381	463200	282209	7.0	Don't think and you'll enjoy it	I tried to summarize the plot but it was really too silly to get into . Basically an evil , dead witch - - who played a sort of tooth fairy when alive - - attacks and kills children and their families when the children lose their last baby teeth . A young man in his 20s - - traumatized by an attack when he was a boy - - tries to help a boy and his sister who are also under attack . But the witch is VERY determined . There's more to it but that's the bare bones of the plot . It's basically the tooth fairy as an evil monster . Silly ? You bet . But it manages to work . The movie starts slowly and quietly setting up the story in an especially creepy prologue and then moves like lightning - - it moves VERY fast , throws in lots of loud noises , tons of sudden shocks and some truly scary attack scenes - - the witch herself is very scary-looking . The trick of the movie is - - don't let the audience think for one minute . If you can do this , you'll enjoy it . If you think , you see the gaps in logic and plot . The film is fairly well-done and the CGI of the witch works very well . It's also very short ( 85 minutes ) and does have its dull stretches . Also , the acting , with one exception , is pretty poor . Chaney Kley ( a Mark Wahlberg look-alike ) plays the hero - - he's kind of nice-looking and has beautiful brown eyes - - but he can't act . Also he's short ( 5'6 " - - maybe ) , not in good shape and has a thin-sounding voice - - this is not to take pot shots at the guy , but if you're playing a hero and called on to do a lot of physical stuff at least pump up a little ! Emma Caulfield does throw in a very good performance as the female lead - - she more then makes up for Kley . The only way to really enjoy this is to see it in a theatre with a great sound system - - I did and it really helped the movie . Hearing the witches screams and growls from all around really work on you . So , a good little one for horror fans - - I give it a 7 . Best line : " All this over a stupid tooth ? "
478635	463200	78481	7.0	Forgotten Altman	Dino Corelli ( Desi Arnaz Jr . ) is marrying Margaret Brenner ( Amy Stryker ) . Naturally everything goes wrong . There's the married woman ( Carol Burnett ) who's being chased around by another man ; a lesbian wedding planner ( Geraldine Chaplin ) ; a gay captain ( Craig Richard Nelson ) ; a senile priest ; a topless portrait of the bride as a wedding gift ; the old head of the family ( Lillian Gish ) who is bedridden etc etc . This isn't even close to being one of Altman's best works like " Nashville " and " Short Cuts " . There are far too many characters , it meanders all over the place and it's too long . Still it's not his worst ( " H . E . A . L . T . H . " is MUCH more horrible ) . This comes across as him trying to please the audience . The story lines are pretty conventional and the PG rating prevents him from throwing in tons of female nudity ( which he seems to love showing in all his films ) . It's not bad but it doesn't look or feel like an Altman film . I was seriously surprised to see he directed it - - I thought it was just some by-the-numbers director who doesn't even try anything different . Direction aside the plots are pretty predictable and Altman doesn't do comedy that well . The bits with Burnett only work because of Burnett's considerable comedic talents . The acting varies from terrible ( Arnaz Jr . ) to OK ( Stryker ) to very good ( Burnett and Chaplin ) . Not the total fiasco that people have said it is but definitely a lesser Altman . A 7 .
477227	463200	71517	7.0	Overly violent but enjoyable trash	Foxy Brown ( Pam Grier ) goes after some vicious drug dealers after they kill her boyfriend . Not as good as " Coffy " for one reason - - it's way too violent and Grier's character is treated horrendously . She's beaten up repeatedly , raped , shot up with drugs , tied down , whipped in the throat and dragged around and tortured - - it just goes too far . However , she gets her revenge very brutally too . It's all fairly enjoyable trash . There's bad dialogue , loads of blood and violence , a lesbian bar fight and some truly terrible acting by Kathryn Loder as the head villain . Also she wears the worst 70s outfits I've ever seen ! Still , worth seeing - - it moves quickly , Grier is fantastic ( as always ) . . . but it's still trash .
478335	463200	67384	7.0	Not really a giallo but pretty good	American reporter Gregory Moore ( played by French Jean Sorel ) is in Prague with fellow reporters Jessica ( Ingrid Thulin ) and Jack ( Mario Ardof ) . He prepares to leave and go to England with Czech girlfriend Myra ( Barbara Bach ) . However she suddenly disappears without a trace . Moore starts to investigate but the police try to block him , his friends tell him to forget her and a mysterious man is following him . . . This is advertised as an Italian giallo but I don't think it really is . At the end it becomes one but about 85 % of the movie is just a thriller - - a good thriller but not a giallo . The title means next to nothing ( as the director says in a short interview on the DVD ) . It was supposed to be called " Short Night of the Butterfly " ( which does work ) but it had to be changed at the last minute . " Glass Dolls " was just picked out of thin air . The film is hurt by poor dubbing - - some of the dialogue is virtually incomprehensible . I had to keep turning the volume up and down to hear ! That aside this is a good movie . The plot is complex and it's beautifully directed . The DVD of this has a gorgeous transfer . The acting is good by everybody - - especially Sorel and Thulin . There's also a beautiful score by Ennio Morricone that perfectly fits the film . All in all a good strong thriller worth catching .
477953	463200	129280	7.0	Better than the original	Remake of the dreadful 1970 Jack Lemmon-Sandy Dennis " comedy " about a couple from Ohio who go to NYC ( for a job interview for the husband ) and have everything go wrong . The original was sick , morbid and had the very annoying Dennis . This one is funny , not hilarious , but funny . It has a better cast ( Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn are comedians - - Lemmon and Dennis weren't ) , and has John Cleese who is hilarious as a snotty hotel manager - - his dead pan delivery of all his lines really worked . Not a masterpiece but not the disaster I heard it was - - for instance the previous Hawn-Martin movie " Housesitter " was much worse . This moves quickly , has an excellent music score and the stars are both in top form . Worth seeing .
479637	463200	47811	8.0	Silly soap opera - - but I LOVED it	40ish Cary Scott ( Jane Wyman ) a wealthy widow falls in love with 20ish Ron Kirby ( Rock Hudson ) who is a gardener . They intend to get married but Cary's rich friends are horrified ( saying he just wants her for the money ) and her college-aged children are totally against it . Will they marry or will all this tear them apart ? OK - - it's glossy , lush , has gorgeous color cinematography , beautiful settings and costumes and wonderfully directed by Douglas Sirk - - but it's NOT a good movie . All the beautiful production values couldn't cover up that this is a very dumb and silly movie . For starters , Hudson and Wyman are pretty lousy . Wyman has the same expression in EVERY shot ( she looks mildly constipated ) and Hudson just stands around looking stunning . Also there's a truly astounding lack of sexual chemistry between the two - - I didn't believe they were in love for a second . The reactions of the friends and family to the wedding was , to say the least , overdone . I couldn't help but smirk at some of the dramatics I saw . Then they threw in a couple of jaw-dropping twists at the end which had me gasping - - in disbelief ! When the deer appeared at the window at the end I completely lost it - - I almost fell out of my chair laughing ! Audiences took this seriously ? ? ? ? ? There are some good things about the movie - - the color and a VERY strong supporting cast headed by Agnes Moorehead . I am giving this film an 8 - - but that's mostly for the camp value . I can honestly say I was never bored - - but I never believed it for a second . Very good for laughs .
477356	463200	87799	8.0	Deserves a cult following	This takes place in the late 1990s . A comet passes through Earth's orbit . It reduces most people to dust or turns them into flesh-eating zombies . The only ones not affected are two Valley Girl sisters ( Catherine Mary Stewart , Kelli Meroney ) who meet Hector ( Robert Beltram ) . They band together to find other survivors . And then there's the evil think tank of scientists ( Mary Woronow among them ) . . . This is dated of course ( the dialogue and the clothes give it away ) but it's LOTS of fun ! It's a smart satire with great dialogue ( there are some hysterically funny lines ) , unusual characters , good direction , a solid soundtrack and a good cast of actors giving their all . Stewart and Meroney especially are a delight throwing off one liners with ease - - their shopping spree to the tune of " Girls Just Wanna Have Fun " is a highlight . Beltran and Woronov are as good as possible - - but they just play the straight men basically . This was marketed as a teen sci-fi film ( which it isn't ) and predictably bombed . It found its audience on cable but disappeared . That is strange - - this has all the earmarkings of a cult classic but never made it . With its DVD release coming soon maybe that will change . Silly but fast , fun and colorful .
478762	463200	26421	8.0	Fun	Busby Berkley directed this silly but very fun musical . The plots have Alice Brady , a very rich widow , losing a great deal of money while financing a huge musical put on by con man Adolphe Menjou ( chewing the scenery ) ; Dick Powell romancing Gloria Stuart and Glenda Farrell blackmailing Hugh Herbert . For once the dialogue isn't as bad as it is in most 1930s musicals with some truly funny comic relief . Also Berkley throws in two just unbelievable production numbers . One of them is set to " The Lullaby of Broadway " - - the tap dancing in this one is incredible and it tells a story with a surprisingly depressing ending . Aside from the Berkley numbers however this is no great shakes but very pleasant and lots of fun . Look for the hilarious scene where Powell and Stuart are on a lake supposedly at 9 : 00 at night but a wide shot shows the sun shining and a clear sky ! And in the very next shot they're in a moonlit grotto ! Didn't anyone ever catch this ?
478152	463200	53001	8.0	Dogpatch in VistaVision !	Adaptation of a hit musical based on a comic strip . It's about a tiny town called Dogpatch and its various strange inhabitants . Chief among them are strong , tall , incredibly handsome Li'l Abner ( Peter Palmer ) and incredibly beautiful Daisy Mae ( Leslie Parrish ) . There are various plots flying around but basically Daisy Mae is in love with Li'l Abner and wants to marry him . . . but he keeps stopping short of it and doesn't know why . There's also various other characters that have names like Earthquake McGoon and Marryin ' Sam . This is one of the few movies shot in a widescreen process called VistaVision . That was a great idea because there are some huge musical numbers that completely fill the wide screen . The dances are colorful and ( to put it mildly ) energetic . The songs are all pretty good with some very clever lyrics . In fact all the characters introduce themselves by singing to the audience ! Some people may enjoy the fact that all the young women here are in great shape and wear VERY revealing costumes . We also have a sequence with some muscular handsome men are shown only wearing shorts . Cheesecake AND beefcake ! However there are drawbacks here . Palmer and Parrish are both incredibly beautiful people and can sing and dance . . . but not act . Palmer's acting was incredibly wooden - - Parrish wasn't much better . Everybody else overacts to a large degree . The plots are pretty stupid and full of corny humor . A little corny humor goes a LONG way and , at two hours , it gets annoying . Still this is worth seeing for the colorful sets and costumes , the songs and the incredible dance numbers . Also Jerry Lewis does a ( thankfully ) brief cameo . Also look for Valerie Harper and Beth Howland as two of the women who have husbands at the end .
478690	463200	60801	8.0	Terrible but in a VERY fun way	The story of Frank Fane ( Stephen Boyd ) and his best friend Hymie Kelly ( Tony Bennett - - yes THAT Tony Bennett ! ) . He treats women like dirt and claws his way to the top and becomes a big Hollywood actor . However he's such an evil character you know he's going to be punished ! Just dreadful . The script has every single cliché you've ever heard of and there's just one hysterically bad line after another ( the actors deserve credit for keeping straight faces ) . So it's not good but it's so bad I was never bored . It's so ridiculously bad you just watch it grinning wondering what they're gonna hit you with next . To add to the fun they use actual Hollywood people in small roles ( Edith Head and Hedda Hopper appear as themselves ) . In a way it's too bad this was such a bomb . If this had been a big hit ( and any good ) it might have made Boyd a big star . He is great in this ! He's over the top nonstop but in an enjoyable bad way . He keeps the movie roaring along and he's always on . He's surrounded by some great actors who give their all . Jill St . John , Milton Berle ( in a dramatic role ! ) , Eleanor Parker , Joseph Cotten ( chewing the scenery ) , Ernest Borgnine , Peter Lawford and Edie Adams all appear in bit parts and they're fantastic . Unfortunately there's some terrible acting by Elke Sommer and Bennett ( no surprise there - - he's a great singer NOT an actor ) . Those two have main roles next to Boyd and they weaken the movie . Still this is a funny , nonstop trashy Hollywood movie . It also shows that Boyd WAS actually a good actor . A must see for movie fans like me . An 8 all the way .
479359	463200	264804	8.0	Pretty good documentary	Documentary on silent film star Lon Chaney . It shows his start in the movies back in the 1910s It seems he was born and raised by two deaf mutes . . . this goes a long way to explaining how he was able to convey so many emotions with his face and gestures . It chronicles his marriages ( one produced his only child - - Lon Chaney Jr . ) and start in show business . The docu is OK . It does stress that Chaney only did a few horror movies - - although that is what he's known for today . It shows rare clips from his many lost films ( over 100 ! ) and from virtually all of his surviving ones . It's a great opportunity to see what a great actor Chaney was - - but this is lacking . There's VERY little info about his personal life - - some people say he was happy go lucky but all accounts I've heard of said he was a very cruel , violent man . There is some interview footage from Chaney Jr . s son talking about his grandfather but that's about it . The movie consists mostly of footage from Chaney's films or talking heads - - people like Ray Bradbury , Forrest Ackerman , Lon Chaney Jr . ( in an old interview before his death ) , various cameraman and such who worked with him . It's a good chronicle of Chaney's movies but VERY little about his personal life . I give it an 8 .
477306	463200	435625	8.0	Very good	Creepy eerie little horror film from England . It's about six women friends who decide to explore an unknown cavern that leads underground . While there that get trapped and find there is a race of cannibals down there too . That's about it for plot but this is still very good . We get to know and understand who the women are before they descend . Refreshingly they aren't all stereotypes - - they are flawed by interesting human beings . Their dialogue is sometimes hard to understand ( this was done in England and the accents are thick ) but you can still figure things out . All the acting is excellent too . The descent down the cave is beautifully done - - constantly being filmed from odd angles to keep the viewer off balance . Also we don't see anything more than the women see underground . They're surrounded by darkness and we're always expecting something to leap out . The film works beautifully in a dark theatre - - it's like you're in the cave with them . The cannibals themselves don't pop up until an hour in - - but it's worth the wait . The first views of them are downright terrifying ( I yelled aloud at one ) but then it doesn't work . For me they stopped being scary when we get good looks at them - - they look like what they are which is guys in costume . Still the gore starts and it is STRONG . Blood flies and bodies are torn asunder . Most of the fights are shot in fast motion which , oddly , works . It all leads up to a silly ending . I know the American version has a different conclusion than the European version - - we'll have to wait for the DVD to find out what it is probably . Still a good strong horror film . But DO NOT see it if you can't stand blood and gore - - this is very strong stuff .
478606	463200	39923	8.0	Oscar-winning cartoon	The first pairing of Tweety Bird and Sylvester was also an Oscar winner . Quick , violent and absolutely hilarious . And every time I hear Tweety say " I tawt I taw a puddy tat " I break up . Well worth catching . Also the print I saw had bright , vivid color . TCM usually shows this around Oscar time - - look for it !
479112	463200	210616	8.0	Cliché city , but I LOVED it !	Let's see - - you've got a bunch of young hopefuls in a tough ballet school in NYyou have the tough , but lovable , black girl ; the token gay man ; the sweet virginal heroine ; the arrogant Russian guy ; the sweet lovable guy who's perfect for the sweet heroine , but she doesn't know it ; the b who's starving herself to death ; the guy who loves her and wants to help her ; the tyrannical ( but lovable ) ballet teachers - - yep , they're all here ! The script is utterly predictable , you know how it's going to end 10 minutes into the movie , but I loved it ! The acting is surprisingly good , it's beautifully filmed , the whole cast is attractive and the dancing is simply superb . I wasn't bored once during the entire 2 hours . Well worth seeing .
478679	463200	64064	8.0	No classic but funny	I had heard about this for years but thought it was just a silly joke . Really - - " Bambi Meets Godzilla " . . . come on ! To my total surprise it played one night years later as part of an animation festival . I admit the credits were amusing and I broke out laughing at the end . . . but that was about it . The animation is terrible and , after seeing it once , it doesn't play well again at all . I think it gets all this attention just because of the title . So , worth catching once but it's just a one-joke film . That's all I have to really say but IMDb requires 10 lines of text for everything . That's kind of silly . I mean foe feature films it makes sense but for a 2 minute short ? ? ? ? ? How much can you say ? It's taking me more time to type this than it takes to watch this short . THERE ! I completed over 10 lines : )
477409	463200	36098	8.0	Lots of fun	I was expecting to hate this film . After all it's a kids film ( I'm 37 ) . I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it ! It's one of those few films that works for both adults and children . It's in color ( which was rare in the early 1940s ) , has a simple story and never becomes too sentimental or childish . It's particularly fun seeing Elizabeth Taylor and Roddy McDowall as children ; Elsa Lancaster as roddy's mother ( ! ! ! ) ; and Nigel Bruce NOT playing Doctor Watson for once and actually proving he could be gruff and aggressive in a performance . Best of all though , is Lassie . I don't know how they did it , but the dog ( actually a male dog named Pal ) gives in an astonishing performance . Just the expressions on her ( his ) face tells you what she ( he ) is thinking ! Also has a great ending that is very moving ( in a good way ) . Very well woth seeing . Only complaint - - the color in this film is so washed out ! Why doesn't someone restore it ?
478199	463200	300274	8.0	Not as good as the first . . .	but still well worth seeing . It's another concert film and Margaret Cho is raring to go . This time around the material is much more explicit with stronger language ( it veers into NC-17 land more than once ) , but it is frequently hilarious . Still , there are many dead spots and some of the jokes bomb badly . Still , I did laugh long and loud more than once . Worth catching . . . but stay away if explicit material bothers you .
477413	463200	335547	8.0	Interesting	OK documentary on the making of " West Side Story " . It has some of the original actors ( like Richard Beymer , Rita Moreno and Russ Tamblyn ) and director and executives talking about the film . It is good to see some of the outtakes of certain scenes and hear Natalie Woods original recordings of the songs ( she was dubbed because , basically , she couldn't sing ) but I found this a little dull . I have little interest in art direction and such so this dragged . For whatever reason George Chakiris wouldn't participate and they got just one or two guys from the gangs to participate . So you're listening to a lot of information from the same people . Also seemingly everyone ( except Tamblyn ) has forgotten that Wood HATED Richard Beymer and didn't want him . Even Beymer doesn't mention it ( although he has talked about it before in other shows ) . So we're given a very cleaned up version of what went on . Still it is worth seeing if you want a complete version of every aspect of the movie . I'm giving it an 8 ( mostly because I love the movie ) but I can't say I'm thrilled by it .
478116	463200	82894	8.0	Not enjoyable but fascinating	This takes place in 1934 Chicago . Sheet music salesman Arthur Parker ( Steve Martin ) hates his job and is married to a frigid unloving wife ( Jessica Harper ) . He then meets naive unmarried Eileen ( Bernadette Peters ) . Sex , rape , abortion , prostitution and murder follow . This is all pretty grim but , without warning , all the characters start lip syncing to cheerful songs from that era and musical numbers start . These numbers are very impressive and would make Busby Berkeley turn green with envy . This was ( for 1981 ) a very odd idea for a big budget Hollywood movie . A bleak , depressing storyline full of unlikable characters is undercut by the cheerful music and dancing . This was released around Christmas as a holiday movie ( a VERY bad idea ) and was savaged by the critics and ignored by audiences . If this had been released at any other time of the year it might have been successful . Also this was years ahead of its time . I saw it twice when it came out . I was thoroughly depressed after each screening but fascinated too . There was nothing else like this at the time . The set design was VERY impressive . Some shots are recreations of famous paintings of that time-I recognized " Nighthawks " right away ! The songs were great and they used the original recordings . They didn't transfer the songs to stereo either - - they wanted them to sound like they did back then . The dances are just downright astounding . They're among some of the best I've ever seen . Christopher Walken stops the show by lip syncing ( and tap dancing ) to " Let's Misbehave " . Casting Martin and Peters in this was a mistake . At this point neither were known for doing drama - - Martin was a comedian and Peters just sang . Martin does OK in his role but Peters is pretty bad in hers . It doesn't destroy the movie it just lessens the impact . Harper is very good ( although she's not in the movie much ) . So it's a depressing but a one of a kind movie . I give it an 8 .
478595	463200	48977	8.0	Classic chiller	Perfect little 8 year old Rhoda ( Patricia McCormack ) is a murderer . When this was released in 1956 , it was for adults only . A movie about a murderous child was very shocking back then . Sadly , though , it isn't anymore . Still , this movie is very scary and still packs a wallop . Patricia McCormack is brilliant as Rhoda - - you see the sweetness swing right into evil and back . . . she should have won the Oscar for this . Nancy Kelly gives a heart-rendering performance as her mother . You can feel her pain and confusion over what to do with Rhoda . Evelyn Varden is fine as the talkative landlord , although she overdoes her adoration of Rhoda a bit . Eileen Heckart is annoying and overacting as an alcoholic . The movie never shows any of the murders . . . you just hear about them later and in one truly terrifying sequence , you hear a man screaming in pain as he's burnt to death . Very effective . The film is pretty obviously adapted from a stage play ( LOTS of talking ) and is a little overlong . Also the psychology is a bit far-fetched . . . " inherited evil " ? Come on ! Also , they changed the ending ( for the censor ) and added a silly little epilogue that single-handedly wrecks the tone of the movie . Still , worth watching . Just turn off as soon as " The End " appears on screen . NOT for children ! ! ! ! ! !
479550	463200	17075	8.0	A very good early Hitchcock film	A story loosely based on Jack the Ripper . In London a killer called the Avenger goes around killing blond-haired girls . Around this time Mr . and Mrs . Bunting take in a lodger ( Ivor Novello ) . He's quiet but very odd . He takes a liking to their blond-haired daughter Daisy ( June Tripp ) . But then the Buntings begin to suspect that he may be the Avenger and want Daisy as his next victim . . . Hitchcock's first thriller and a very good one . Very few title cards are used - - he uses images to carry the film . Sometimes it works but , more than once , I was confused . It was one of his first films though so this can be forgiven . It also moves a bit too slow . But it's still worth seeing . You can see the beginnings of his later work peeking through and there are some sequences so well directed that they're stunning ( the one where Novello and Tripp kiss is just SO beautiful ) . Also the acting is actually quite good by everybody - - especially Novello . He was a box office draw in the 1920s and it's easy to see why . The man is not only a good actor he was undeniably beautiful . It's easy to see why he was once called one of the most beautiful men alive . Novello was gay - - I wonder if Hitch knew that . There are two lines in this film where people talk about his character - - " Good thing he doesn't like girls " and " Even if he is a bit queer " . These lines are quite interesting now - - I wonder if they were put in on purpose or just happened to be written without anyone knowing . Interesting to think about . . .
478415	463200	101757	8.0	Really stupid bit I LOVED it !	OK the premise is dumb , the babysitter dies within the first 15 minutes and the kids basically have to live alone all summer . Applegate easily gets an executive position ( just like real life , right ? ) and , naturally , is incredible at her job . And her brothers and sisters learn values from her example . . . yadda , yadda , yadda . Sounds horrible , but it's well-acted ( especially Applegate and Cassidy ) , it moves quickly , it is very funny and I enjoyed every minute of it ! Not a great movie by any means , but if you can turn off your brain for 2 hours , you'll really enjoy it !
479609	463200	83642	9.0	Sadly forgotten	Big , splashy , fun musical about a whorehouse ( the Chicken Ranch ) in Texas run by Miss Mona ( Dolly Parton ) . She's in love with the sheriff ( Burt Reynolds ) and the town has no problem with the house . Then a sleazy TV showman ( Dom DeLuise ) exposes the ranch and all hell breaks lose . This was a huge bomb in 1982 for some reason . It's full of energy and enthusiasm , has great songs and some fantastic all out production numbers . Reynolds is just OK but Parton is an absolute joy - - she gives one of her best performances and even sings " I Will Always Love You " ( I prefer Whitney's version ) . Also there is equal amounts of male and female nudity and has a healthy attitude about sex ( this was made before AIDS was well-known about ) . And Charles Durning stops the show with his " sidestepping " number . . . he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for this . This should never have bombed - - maybe the title scared people away . Only complaint is the ending . It's way too serious and realistic - - I wish they had opted for a fairy tale like ending . Also Lois nettleton's subplot is seriously underdeveloped - - I assume it was shot but cut out for the running time . See it and enjoy !
478796	463200	48028	9.0	Near perfect movie	WARNING - - There are going to be many plot spoilers in this review . This takes place in 1917 Monterey , California . Adam Trask ( Raymond Massey ) is bringing up two sons alone - - Cal ( James Dean ) and Aaron ( Richard Davalos ) . He tells them their mother ( Jo Van Fleet ) is dead but actually she left him and is now a madam in a neighboring town . Adam doesn't like Cal but loves Aaron and his girlfriend Abra ( Julie Harris ) . Cal tries to get his father's love in any way he can but things escalate and get worse and end tragically . In some ways this is just great . Some of the direction by Elia Kazan is annoying ( he continuously frames sequences at tilted angles which throws you out of the movie ) but all in all it works . The acting is superb . Massey is good and Van Fleet is very good - - she won a Best Supporting Actress award for this . She's good but not THAT good ! Burl Ives is also excellent in a supporting role . However the three young leads carry this movie . Davalos is just great in his role - - especially at the end when he meets mother . Harris ( top billed ) is just wonderful . She perfectly captures her characters innocence . Dean is just simply superb . When he's on screen you can't stop watching him . He captures his characters hatred and yearning to get his fathers love . The scene where he breaks down at his fathers party at the end is just heart-breaking . My problems with this is the story jumps around . At one point Cal seems to have a girlfriend - - but we're never introduced to her or find out who she is . Also Cal seems to be punished at the end . For what ? Trying to win the love of an uncaring father ? For showing his brother the truth about their mother ? I never bought the end for one second . That prevents me from giving this a 10 - - but it does deserve a 9 . Worth seeing .
477215	463200	1021000	9.0	Amusing	Short about a gay couple - - Michael ( Justin Martindale ) and John ( Sam Mathewes ) - - who want a baby . A pregnant woman ( Katharine Phillips Moses ) " interviews " them to see if they would be good parents for her unborn child . Things don't go smoothly . Funny little comedy . The two men WOULD be good parents ( you can tell ) but they constantly stumble over their words and , out of nervousness , say the wrong things . They also take a few mild jabs at each other . It's well-acted - - Martindale and Mathewes play off each other very well and the dialogue is on target and funny . A nice funny short about gay parents and surrogate mothers . A 9 .
478064	463200	14142	9.0	Classic silent film	Quasimodo ( Lon Chaney ) is the hideously deformed bell ringer for Notre Dame . Esmeralda ( Patsy Ruth Miller ) is a beautiful dancing gypsy . She loves high and mighty Phoebus ( Norman Kerry ) but is loved by evil , scheming Jehan ( Brandon Hurst ) . All this comes to a head at the end with a revolution . This is not a horror film as many believe . It's a strong , exciting and epic drama . This was a huge production for Universal pictures - - the sets themselves covered acres and acres of land . Notre Dame itself is especially impressive . They also got Chaney and Kerry who were both big stars at the time and a supporting cast of hundreds ( that's no exaggeration ) . The movie itself is just great - - all the money and effort that went into it pays off . It moves at a brisk pace and the numerous subplots always keep you interested . All the acting is good with top honors going to Hurst , Miller and Kerry . Best of all is Chaney - - he's just superb . His acting beneath all that makeup is nothing short of miraculous . In some ways this is almost better than " Phantom of the Opera " ( which is considered his best movie ) . I still like " Phantom " more but this one is great on its own . A must-see . I saw the uncut 2 hour version on TCM . It's not in the best of shape but is still OK .
478321	463200	44954	9.0	Excellent film noir	A dead mobsters wife ( Marie Windsor ) is going to testify against the mob . Detective Sergeant Water Brown ( Charles McGraw ) is hired to take her from Chicago to Los Angeles by train and protect her . There are bad guys on the train - - but they don't know what she looks like . Can Brown keep her a secret all the way ? Fast ( 70 minutes ) , tight B film . A perfect example of how to shot an exciting movie in a small setting - - 95 % of the film takes place in small train compartments . Director Richard Fleischer deserves a lot of credit for this . The script moves quickly and there's a great twist at the end ( I'm almost ashamed to admit I didn't see it coming ) . Also a very violent fight in a compartment is a highlight . Windsor and McGraw are fine in their roles - - no Academy Award performances here but they are as good in their roles as is possible . A classic B film noir . Well worth catching . Avoid the terrible 1990 remake .
478653	463200	75148	9.0	The first was the best	Rocky Balboa ( Sylvester Stallone ) , a second-rate boxer in Philadelphia , gets a match with the world champion Apollo Creed ( Carl Weathers ) . Also he falls in love with mousy Adrienne ( Talia Shire ) who blossoms with his love . He's trained by a tough-as-nails ( but loving ) trainer ( Burgess Meredith ) . This is the type of story that was being laughed off screens in the 1940s . . . but it works beautifully here . The characters are believable , flawed human beings ; the script is just great ( written by Stallone before he became full of himself ) and ( surprisingly ) all the acting is good ( Meredith and Shire take top honors ) . The theme music is rousing and the climatic fight is just fantastic . It's predictable as they come , but it's all so well-done you won't care . A HUGE hit in 1976 . As much as I like this I still can't believe it won the Best Picture Oscar back in 1977 . Still , don't miss it ! As for the sequels , Rocky 2 wasn't bad but 3 , 4 and 5 were horrendous .
477691	463200	114369	9.0	Very grim and disturbing but you can't stop watching	Detective Lt . William Somerset ( Morgan Freeman ) is about to retire . He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills ( Brad Pitt ) . Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M . O . Meanwhile Mills ' wife Tracy ( Gwyneth Paltrow ) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed . Dark and depressing but just fascinating . Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face . The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter . No humor either . It all leads to a truly harrowing ending . There was supposed to be a happy ending but they ( wisely ) chose not to do it . Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances . I even thought Paltrow ( who I hate ) was good ! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role . If you have trouble with blood , gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie . But if you can handle that , watch this one . It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting .
477484	463200	1544	9.0	Mostly historically important but moderately entertaining	This is obviously not a full adaptation of Charles Dickens story - - it only runs 17 minutes ! It assumes the audience knows the story and just basically gives us the highlights . It involves all 4 visits from the ghosts ( using some surprisingly good special effects for the time ) and flashbacks to Scrooge's life . And it shows his complete change . It's actually very well-done and , for what it is , entertaining . But where's Tiny Tim ? Nevertheless , recommended .
479660	463200	108906	10.0	Talk about warped !	Brilliant , scary , funny soap opera ( sort of ) of an extremely dysfunctional hospital in the Netherlands . Yeah , it's 4 hours and a half . . . yeah it's all subtitles . . . yeah , it has no ending . . . but who cares ? The film basically LOOKS different ! It always looks drab ( purposely ) , and some camera-work that's very shaky but it perfectly fits the tone of the film . It's basically a combination of all different genres - - horror film , love story , sex , blackmail , malpractice and two mildly retarted dishwashers who act as a Greek chorus . The acting ranges from OK to excellent . The plot twists and turns and weaves - - I was never bored ! One complaint - - reading subtitles for so long can strain your eyes . I first saw it at a revival theatre . They showed it straight through with NO breaks ! No one left and the audience applauded long and loud after the showing . I walked out exhausted and laughing at the same time . It's unlike ANYTHING you've seen before . This is continuted in " Riget 2 " which still has no ending . It was going to be wrapped up in a third miniseries but two of the main actors died and the director said he couldn't do it without them . So they'll never be an ending but you won't care . You'll just be astounded by what you do see . Highly recommended .
478214	463200	35140	10.0	Davis ' best	I haven't seen every Bette Davis film , but I find it hard to believe anything can top this one ! Beautifully shot , wonderfully romantic score , interesting story , well-acted and Davis is breathtakingly beautiful ! She's never looked better ! It's one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen ( shipboard romance , TWO goodbyes at airports , everybody looks so handsome or glamorous ) , and has three classic sequences - - Davis telling a man she can't marry him by saying , " Let's not dwell on it . " ; Paul Henreid lighting two cigarettes in his mouth ( romantic , but they both smoke WAY too much ! ) ; and Davis ' line , " Let's not wish for the moon , when we have the stars " . A great movie all the way . Not to be missed !
477876	463200	347930	10.0	A gay classic	The " story " involves a young marine ( Brian Thompson ) on leave . He goes to visit friends and treks through a forest . There he meets a hunky forest ranger ( Bill Henson ) who supposedly watches over the entire forest ! Surprisingly they DON'T have sex ! He reaches his friends and experiences sex with them . THEN he goes back through the forest and meets Henson again and they enjoy each other . OK - - this is amateur night in terms of plot and acting . . . but who watches a gay porno for those ? You watch for hot guys with nice bodies . This is an early one ( it was shot in the late 1970s ) so none of the guys are muscular ( except for Henson ) but they are young , good-looking ( in a 70s sort of way ) and rearing to go ! The sex is very erotic and exciting and no condoms ( this was pre-AIDS ) . I personally thought Thompson was hot and he's in almost every sex scene ! Henson is tall and muscular . . . but that accent of his ( vaguely Southern ) makes him sound like an idiot . Still u sort of forget that when he's nude . This won numerous awards at adult film ceremonies and is rightfully considered a gay porn classic . A must see for gay porn viewers .
479628	463200	132367	10.0	Chilling	I caught this documentary at a small art house cinema back in 1981 . There was no rating but you had to be over 18 to be admitted . I have never forgotten it . It's about pornography and how it degrades women . They specifically target porno films where women are tied up and used . To make their point they do have to show clips from these films - - and they're just revolting . I have nothing against porn - - but not when it's violent and people are being tied up or forced . They also talk to people who run porno shops and women who perform sex acts live . The most interesting interview I remember was when they talked to a wife and husband who preformed live sex acts to each other on stage ( she's white , he's black ) . She actually defends what she's doing quite well and had me believing her ! Just fascinating with hardcore sex - - but it IS necessary for the integrity of the film . It's also horrifying that some people enjoy this sort of " entertainment " . Hard to find - - it deserves wide distribution . A 10 .
478962	463200	166924	10.0	One of Lynch's best	Betty ( Naomi Watts in a fantastic performance ) tries to help an amnesiac " Rita " ( Laura Elena Harring ) find out who she is . There's a lot more than that to the plot , but you should see the film yourself to find out . Almost as good as " Blue Velvet " , this is David Lynch's newest mind trip . It makes sense for an hour and 45 minutes ( it was originally a pilot for a TV series that was rejected by ABC ) but then things change drastically and images ( and characters ) go barelling out of control . . . but that's expected from Lynch . Characters and things change in very unexpected ways . . . alternate realities seem to step in . Or do they ? This last section is wide open to interpretation - - like the best Lynch films this demands multiple viewings . If you're a Lynch fan ( like me ) or if you like films that are adult and challenge you , go see it . If not , stay away . Also , there's a not so explicit lesbian love scene .
478465	463200	18054	10.0	Excellent silent movie	Movie follows the story of Jesus Christ ( H . B . Warner ) starting with Mary Magdelene ( Jacqueline Logan ) and ending with his resurrection . While not exactly accurate ( Magdalene was Judas ' lover ? ) to the Bible this is actually an excellent movie . It's very reverent to the story and doesn't preach to the audience like other Biblical movies did . Some of the shots of Jesus were stunning - - he ( literally ) GLOWS . It's all done with lighting but it looks realistic . And since it's directed by Cecil B . DeMille it's a spectacle - - this movie is BIG ! The sets are colossal , there's a cast of hundreds and a big huge Crucifiction sequence that is quite impressive . There's also some nice special effects - - surprising in a movie that's over 70 years old . Also , it's well-cast . The standouts are Warner as Jesus ; Logan making a very impressive Magdelene and Joseph Schildkraut playing a very young and handsome Judas . Also his father Rudolph Schildkraut plays Caiaphas . And the Resurrection sequence at the end is in two-color Technicolor . This is a much better than the 1961 remake . That one was badly cast ( Jeffrey Hunter was way too young for the role ) , too long ( almost 3 hours ) and dragged . This one is barely 2 hours and moves very quickly . A very impressive silent film - - well worth catching .
477292	463200	22208	10.0	Tough , quick melodrama	Barbara Stanwyck plays a night nurse at a very strange household where some children may be in serious danger . Strong pre-Code film has ( for 1931 ) strong dialogue , Stanwyck and Joan Blondell in their underwear , alcoholism , nymphomania , attempted rape , child abuse and Clark Gable ( without his mustache ) slugging Stanwyck unconscious . The plot is kind of silly but the film moves so quickly ( 72 minutes ) that you sort of disregard it . There are also some nice directorial touches from William Wellman . The whole cast is great : Stanwyck is just superb in the title role - - smart , strong and has no fear - - she almost manages to stare Gable down in one of their fights . Gable is incredible as the bad guy - - violent , brutal and very scary . There's great support from Blondell as Stanwyck's best friend and Ben Lyon as a bootlegger with the hots for her . A really great film - - don't miss this one ! Two of the many great lines : " I'm a nymphomaniac . . . and I'm proud of it ! " " You MOTHER ! "
477146	463200	35524	10.0	One of the best Superman cartoons	Mt . Monokoa ( located on a nice little island ) seems like it's about to erupt . Naturally there's a town right at the base of the mountain . Reporters Clark Kent and Lois Lane are sent to cover the story for the Daily Planet . While there Lois hides Clark's press pass so she can see the mountain for herself and " scoop " him on the story . While Lois is at the top of the mountain it explodes ! She's trapped up there with the lava flowing all around . Superman is around but how can he save her and the entire town ? Very good cartoon - - quick-moving , beautifully animated and some very nice sequences when the volcano explodes . Never a dull moment - - I especially like how Lois tries to escape from the lava ! Worth catching .
479063	463200	92005	10.0	Just great	The best ever adaptation of a Stephen King work ( " The Body " from his book " Different Seasons " ) . In 1959 Maine , 4 12-year-old boys go to find a dead body . It's a 2 day journey and , along the way , one of them Gordy ( Will Wheaton ) , grows and realizes things about himself . Yes , it's a coming of age story , but very well written , directed ( in Oregon ) and with mostly great performances . Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell are just OK as two of the boys . Wheaton is very good as Gordy and River Phoenix is exceptional as Chris - - it's sad that he ODed at such a young age . Also Keifer Sutherland is chilling as the head of a teenage gang . Also John Cusack has a good small role and Richard Dreyfuss narrates the story . This movie perfectly captures what it's like to be a 12 year old boy growing up - - the dialogue is just perfect . Some people complained about the excessive profanity in this ( it IS R rated ) , but swearing did exist back in 1959 . Well worth seeing . Don't see this on commercial TV : that version edits the language out and renders parts of the film incomprehensible .
479170	463200	51658	10.0	Exhausting but great	Movie musical takes place in France in 1900 . Teenage tomboy Gigi ( Leslie Caron ) is madly in love with an adult man ( Louis Jourdan ) but he just sees her as a little girl . Her aunt ( Hermione Gingold ) is trying to bring her up to be a proper lady . Jourdan does start to realize Gigi is a woman . . . but doesn't want to marry her . Very colorful and energetic MGM musical - - easily one of the best musicals of the 1950s . The costumes and settings are wonderful ( and won Academy Awards ) and makes you believe that you are in 1900 ! In fact it received nine ( I believe ) Academy Awards - - among them best director and best picture . The songs are great - - there's not really a bad one among them ( although the title song is kind of dull ) . The acting is great too - - Caron is full of life and her transformation from teenager to woman is totally believable . Gingold is great as her aunt and Jourdan is tall and VERY handsome . Also Maurice Chevalier pops up to instruct Jourdan every once in a while . I do have a few minor quibbles - - Chevalier ( who was 70 at the time ) singing " Thank Heaven For Little Girls " while leering at some teenage girls - - I realize this was done in a more innocent era but it comes across as pretty unsettling today . There's totally dreadful back projection when Jourdan and Chevalier are talking ( and singing ) in a carriage . And the RED walls of Gingold's apartment really were getting to me . Also this movie gets too lively at times - - I was exhausted just watching some of the numbers ! Still , this is a lively fun movie . Highly recommended .
478024	463200	257850	10.0	Powerful , moving	Excellent cable movie dealing with the horrendous murder of gay Matthew Shepard in 1998 in Laramie , Wyoming . A theatre group went to the town and interviewed the citizens and came back with 400 hours of material . This became a play with actors playing the towns citizens . It's now been done as an HBO film with a top-notch cast playing the citizens . There are also reenactments of the trial of the two murderers and their convictions . This is definetely a strange film but totally fascinating with many powerful moments . The scene where Matthew Shepard's father addresses one of the killers of his son is gut-wrenching - - it's hard to believe it's just an actor reading dialogue . Previous posters have complained about not using the real townspeople talking . I don't think that's a valid argument - - many of these people probably wouldn't want to appear on film and would they really want to go through recreations of the trial and the protests outside ? Also , there's not one bad acting job from anybody in the cast but special honors go to Camryn Manheim , Christina Ricci and Amy Madigan . A powerful , painful film . A definite must-see for everybody .
478436	463200	90756	10.0	A masterpiece	A very strange movie but incredible . A young man ( Kyle MacLaclan ) comes home to help care for his sick father . Soon he's in love with a detective's daughter ( Laura Dern ) and mixed up in a mystery involving Dorothy Valdes ( Isabella Rossellinni ) and psycho Frank Booth ( Dennis Hopper ) . Probably David Lynch's best film . The story has gaps in logic , but it's secondary to some incredible wide screen imagery ( this has to be seen letter-boxed . . . no two ways about it ) . Lynch has said in interviews that he thinks of the image first then works it into the movie . You can tell . . . things that make no sense at first gradually make sense later on . This movie also demands multiple viewings . . . I was so shocked the first time I saw it , I couldn't concentrate on it . . . it took THREE viewings to finally get it . As to what the movie is about . . . it depends who you ask . Some people said it's the Hardy Boys on drugs . . . others say it's about a boy's sexual awakening . . . others see it as good vs . evil . . . each one is a valid statement ! To me , that's a true art film . . . one that means multiple things all at once . The performances are top-notch . This film made MacLachlan . . . him and Laura Dern work well together and give nice low-key performances . Dern is just great . . . but she does look pretty silly when she tries to cry . Rossellinni is nowhere near as good as her mother ( Ingrid Bergman ) was , but she deserves credit for taking such a risky role . She's pretty good . Hopper is WAYYYYYYY over the top as Booth . . . he's both horrifying and hilarious . . . a great performance . And let's not forget Dean Stockwell as " suave Ben " . His " performance " of " In Dreams " is a definite highlight . Be warned - - the film is very extreme . There's explicit violence , plenty of nudity , sex and tons of profanity . Not for the squeamish . Still , I loved it from beginning to end . One of my favorite films of all time .
