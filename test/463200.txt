479483	463200	372884	1.0	Boring , stupid , unfunny and homophobic	Hunky Caleb ( Scott Lansford ) is a laid-back guy who has the hots for aggressive girls . He falls for Gwen ( Emily Stiles ) a VERY aggressive girl who only goes for gay guys . Caleb's roommate Kyle ( Jim Verraros ) tells Gwen that Caleb is gay . Gwen is immediately attracted to him and pairs him up with her hunky gay roommate Marc ( Ryan Carnes ) . Unfortunately Kyle is in love with Marc . Got all that ? It all culminates in a supposedly " hilarious " dinner party . Horrid movie . The plot is just old hat - - a straight guy playing gay - - how many times have we seen this ? Also everybody acts like idiots . At any time in this movie Caleb could have just set Gwen and Marc straight - - but he never does . Also the film has more than a few homophobic comments - - at one point Gwen believes Caleb is a virgin and says , " Shouldn't you try NORMAL sex before gay ? " That's not funny just blatantly offensive . The script is dreadful - - the characters don't talk like any person I've ever met in my life . They use this slang which is supposed to be funny but it's just confusing and annoying . Acting - - Lansford underplays Caleb . . . . but his character IS supposed to be passive so it works . He's also exceptionally handsome with a great body . Carnes is also very handsome with a great body . Too bad he can't act . And they both have a frontal nude scene ( which was surprising ) . Verraros overacts dreadfully as Kyle - - he comes across as whiny and stupid - - very annoying . But Stiles is much worse - - she overacts so much she makes Verraros look restrained ! She screams every line and is basically attacking Caleb even when he's dating Marc ! She also brutally tells Kyle off at the end and is wearing the most atrocious hair style I've ever seen . Caleb is attracted to HER ? ? ? I saw it at the Gay & Lesbian Film Festival in Boston . The audience did laugh occasionally - - but mostly they sat there in dead silence . This is a truly horrendous gay film . It's too bad because the two leads ARE hot and have no trouble showing their bodies . But I can't recommend this at all . The worst film of 2004 - - it's THAT bad ! Some people have called this the first of a new wave of gay cinema . If this is an example of things to come we're all in trouble .
477632	463200	83550	1.0	Makes Part 1 look like " Gone With the Wind "	The original " Amityville Horror " was not a good horror film . It wasn't totally worthless either - - it had good acting , a few nice scares and a great ending . . . but it wasn't that good . Still , compared to this , it's some sort of a masterpiece . Purportedly this took place before " The Amityville Horror " which came out in 1979 . It shows a severely dysfunctional family with an abusive father ( Burt Young ) . The son ( imaginatively named Sonny ) starts hearing noises and voices . He also ( for no good reason ) starts an incestuous relationship with his sister . Then he slowly starts to go crazy and the voices tell him to kill his family . . . The story is by the numbers , the acting in this one is bad and the material is very disturbing - - Sonny ( who looks about 22 but is supposed to be a teenager ) seducing his sister is particularly sick ( and needless ) . The special effects are sickening , not frightening and the movie manages to be boring and sleazy all at once . The only part that scared me was when the girl was trying to run away from her brother ( who has a gun ) . . . and literally runs right into him . A stupid , sleazy , boring horror film . Avoid .
478523	463200	202677	1.0	Dreadful	A 2 hour commercial for guns . Two morons capture a heavily pregnant woman , and hold her for ransom . The direction is good , but that's about it . The plot makes no sense ( I'm still not sure what a whole group of old men was doing in this ) , characters appear and disappear very quickly , the humor is sick , the tone of the film is very disturbing and it's just one gunfight after another . As for the acting . . . they have good actors , but they give the worst performances of their careers . Taye Diggs , Ryan Philippe , James Caan . . . all are horrible . . . and they're all very good actors ! A total waste of time and talent .
478333	463200	77942	1.0	I had ( blessedly ) forgotten this train wreck	Rich and lonely Trish ( Lily Tomlin ) meets and falls in love with Strip ( John Travolta ) who's at least 15 years younger than her . They both have issues - - but do they love each other enough to battle those issues together ? Believe me - - you won't care ! I had forgotten that I saw this . I was 16 when it came out and this ( inexplicibly ) has an R rating . I had always loved Lily Tomlin and wanted to see it . In fact at the time this came out Tomlin and Travolta were ( purportedly ) madly in love with each other in real life . It turns out that was all a publicity stunt to sell the movie . Anyways , I conned my mom into taking me to see it . Wow - - was THAT a mistake ! Talk about dull ! My mom and me literally kept dozing off during the movie . By the end ( which is REAL stupid ) I actually was giggling at how hopeless this movie was . It bombed badly and years of therapy helped me block it . But . . . it's come back to haunt me ! Tomlin and Travolta CAN be good ( given the right material ) but this script was just so tedious and dull that even they couldn't pull it off . Travolta is as good as anyone can be . Tomlin REALLY tries but she's hopelessly miscast . She only got the role because director Jane Wagner and her were ( and still are ) lovers . I ( sorta ) want to see this on DVD to see if it's as bad as I remembered . I've heard there might actually be a DVD release of this in the works . That would be kind of cool . A 1 all the way .
479193	463200	101026	1.0	A sexist piece of garbage	WARNING - - SPOILERS AHEAD ! Some previous posters have said this film is a masterpiece and not sexist . Oh really ? The woman ( Abril ) is shown doing a really embarrassing thing with an underwater toy , is tied up repeatedly , threatened with a knife , gagged , hit ( quite brutally ) by Banderas and is constantly being verbally abused by him . But she ends up falling in love with him ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ! What the hell was that ? A woman has to be abused by a man to fall in love with him ? That's not sexist ? It's disgusting ! To make matters worse Abril and Banderas give such good performances ( easily Banderas ' best ) that it all looks believable . It all leads to a really stupid ending that made me want to throw something heavy at the screen . I see lots of movies and I've never been more offended than I was by this one . A sick , degrading , sexist piece of crap . Almodovar should be ashamed of himself .
478435	463200	171344	1.0	Boring and silly	First off , the title is wrong . There are girls and there is a gang but they're only incidental to the story . Most of the movie deals with a bunch of very overage " teenagers " getting hooked on heroin . Purportedly this movie is supposed to be a warning against it , yet it shows them all having a great time while on it ! They're singing , dancing ( a sequence that goes on for 10 minutes . Why ? To eat up running time ! ) and having sex . . . so what it they're hooked ? There's even a sequence which shows - - step by step - - how to inject heroin ! Very cheaply done , all horrible acting with uproarious dialogue . Also the worst use of music ever ! Most of the time it doesn't even fit the scene ! It's really hard to explain how totally worthless this movie is . Not even bad / good . Skip it .
477164	463200	582	1.0	Hilarious	Silly short silent is NOT " Ben-Hur " . It's highlights from the book with cards filling in the ( many ) gaps . The sets are cardboard cut-outs ( pretty obviously ) , ALL the acting is bad and the " direction " is virtually nonexistent . I suppose it's got some historical value as the very first version of the story but is totally lacking in entertainment value . See it for laughs only .
479442	463200	67361	1.0	Another crappy Fulci film	An extremely dull murder mystery about murders and a woman who has extremely strange ( and stupid ) dreams and hallucinations . Surprisingly , there's no gore in this film ( usually director Fulci rubs the audience's face in it ) . . . doesn't make it a good film though . The story is slow and confusing , the direction is very annoying ( the strobe lights were particularly grating ) and the acting is lousy . Also there's a lieutenant in the film who is CONSTANTLY whistling . . . I wanted the killer to show up and kill him to shut him up ! There is an OK chase towards the end , but that's about it . I realize Fulci has his admirers - - but why ? His films are pointless , badly dubbed , have unbelievably disgusting gore , no plots and zero characterizations . This is one of the films minus the gore . A total waste of time - - can't say talent because there isn't any .
477658	463200	339209	1.0	Just dreadful gay coming of age movie	Movie about a college guy who is confused about his sexuality . He's in a fraternity and keeps it hidden from his fraternity brothers . Then he meets a male student he's attracted to and things come out in the open . PLOT SPOILERS ! ! ! I caught this a few years ago at a Gay & Lesbian Film Festival . I had blocked it - - for good reason - - until I saw it here . It's all come roaring back . First off , the basic plot is OK but this takes forever to get going . Secondly , the acting really REALLY sucks . I notice that most of the " actors " here never made another movie . Thirdly , it's flatly directed with faded color and occasionally inaudible sound . Fourth , you don't care about the characters or situations for one second . Five , the reactions of the fraternity brothers to one of their own being gay were so accepting it's almost comical . Six , it's so obvious the two actors are hating every second of the ( one ) gay kiss in this . Some people mention there was some full frontal nudity and butt shots ( I seriously don't remember any ) but you don't want to see ANY of these guys nude . You can rent a gay porno for hot nude guys . This may have been made with serious intentions but the lousy script and bad acting destroy it . At the film festival this was met with dead silence and lots of people walked out complaining how bad it was . There are many other better gay movies out there . Skip this one .
479011	463200	101917	1.0	Bottom of the barrel here	It WAS supposed to be the last Freddy movie ( and it was for over 10 years ) - - you would think they would have tried to get a good movie done . But they turned out giving us the worst of the series ( and that's saying a lot ) . The plot made no sense ( I seriously can't remember it ) , all the main characters were idiots ( you REALLY wanted them dead ) and Freddy's wisecracks were even worse than usual . The only remotely good bit about this was a brief ( and funny ) cameo by Johnny Depp ( the first " Nightmare " movie was his first ) . Also I originally saw it in a theatre were the last section ( reaccounting Freddy's childhood ) was in 3-D . Well - - the 3-D was lousy - - faded colors and the image going in and out of focus . Also the three flying skulls which were supposed to be scary ( I think ) had the opposite reaction from my audience . EVERYBODY broke down laughing . Looks even worse on TV in 2-D . Pointless and stupid - - very dull also . Skip this one and see " Freddy vs . Jason " again .
479413	463200	221583	2.0	Pretty horrendous	This takes place on Fire Island back in the 1970s . A couple Peter ( Craig Dudley ) and Buddy ( J . Will Deane ) are throwing a 4th of July party at their house . Unfortunately their relationship is falling apart and they have to get ready for a house full of very strange guests . The rest of the movie chronicles the party and what happens between Peter and Buddy . OK - - I'm a gay man but I was 8 back when this was made . If this is a true view of what gay life was in the 1970s , I'm glad I wasn't around . From the puzzling opening credits which shows kids playing in the sand ( ? ? ? ) this movie slides slowly into disaster . There's a guru ( Robert Case ) who talks nonstop about nothing of any importance . I wanted to gag the guy halfway into his first LONG speech . There's the young kid Danny who is there for his first time . There's the lesbian couple ( who do nothing - - except one strips for no reason ) . There's the leather queen . Worst of all is the effeminate man named Jimmy ( Jimmy Foster ) . We're introduced to him and his friend ( whose name I never got ) when they get a flat tire . They basically scream and screech for 10 minutes and have NO idea how to fix a flat . I know some people find this funny but I found it offensive and pretty sad . The party itself is full of people you would never want to know . It's like being dumped in a party full of bad actors playing obnoxious people . With the sole exception of Dudley no one can act . This may be valuable as a portrait of what Fire Island was like in the 1970s . . . but it's pretty dull viewing . This gets a 2 only for the frequent male nudity of some very nice bodies .
478303	463200	59914	2.0	A real snooze	This takes place in the future . There's a space station under the watch of Commander Mike Halsted ( Tony Russel ) with buddy Jake ( Franco Nero ) and ex-girlfriend Lt . Gomez ( Lisa Gastoni ) . Obnoxious Dr . Numi ( Massimo Serato ) is conducting some mysterious experiments . It seems he's shrinking people down for . . . some reason . To be honest I had trouble staying awake ! Sleep inducing mess full of bad dubbing , hilarious special effects ( you HAVE to see the obvious miniatures they use ) , an incomprehensible plot , gorgeous vapid babes , square-jawed bland heroes and just tons of bad lines . " Helium head " had me roaring ! Unfortunately it's more boring than funny and I kept dozing off . There is a great fight sequence between three guys and three women ( the women are winning ! ) and a fantastic ending but that's not enough to save this . Dubbed and dull . Drink lots of coffee if you expect to make it through this one ! A 2 .
478674	463200	30396	3.0	Dismal attempt at a screwball comedy	Society deb Melsa Manton ( Barbara Stanwyck ) discovers a body late one night in a abandoned house . She goes to get the police but when they return the body is missing . The police don't believe her so Manton and her bunch of ditzy friends try and solve the murder mystery themselves . Reporter Peter Ames ( Henry Fonda ) immediately falls in love with Melsa ( after hating her on sight ) and helps them . Pretty unknown movie . . . and it's easy to see why ! Stanwyck , a wonderful actress , is woefully miscast as Manton . Fonda hated doing this movie and it shows . He's stone-faced throughout . The movie has plenty of potential but the comedy is either stupid or unfunny . Also I found Melsa's bunch of friends incredibly annoying - - they all act like idiots and they're constantly screaming at everything . The romance between Manton and Ames comes out of nowhere and isn't believable for one second . Pauline Kael once wrote that this was written by people who had too much time on their hands . How true ! Halfway through I just turned it off in disgust - - I was bored and sick of having my intelligence insulted . If you want to see a good movie with Stanwyck and Fonda see " The Lady Eve " . This one is hopeless .
479072	463200	303732	3.0	Never saw the first . . .	. . . but I heard it's dreadful . This one isn't much good either . A bunch of annoying camp counselors are closing down a summer camp for the winter . A masked killer suddenly shows up and starts killing them off one by one . Who is it and why ? The movie has its good points - - it's pretty well directed ; the script isn't TOO bad and the murder scenes are VERY gory , brutal and scary . That's about it for compliments . That aside the movie is atrociously sexist - - there is a pointless shower sequence and sex scene in which the women's breasts are shown constantly ( in closeup no less ) . Meanwhile next to nothing is shown by the guys . I'm sick and tired of filmmakers throwing pointless female nudity in a film . This might shock them but not EVERY male viewer wants to see that . I see a horror film to be scared - - not have nudity rubbed in my face . It's degrading . If you're going to show it on the girls why not show what the guys have ? Be an equal opportunity sexist ! That aside the movie is slow-moving , the acting is lousy ( with Kelly Gunning as Mike being the worst ) and the final chase with the killer after the final girl goes on FOREVER ! So I've seen worse but I've definetely seen better . The appalling sexism in this really got to me . I give it a 3 .
478562	463200	60921	3.0	Talk about dated !	A Russian submarine is accidentally grounded off the coat of a small New England island named Gloucester Island ( which is fictional ) . Some Russians ( headed by Alan Arkin ) go to the island to get help . Naturally everybody on the island thinks they're being invaded . " Hilarious " complications ensure . I realize this has is fans - - but most people who like it seem to have fond memories of seeing it as children . I was too young to see it when it came out and I personally find this a bad movie . It found it loud , labored , slow-moving and far too long . Also it isn't funny - - not even once . I think I smirked once but that was it . I also fail to see the humor when all the townspeople grab their guns automatically to go and kill all the Russauins . It all leads up to a horribly manipulative ending which just made me angry . Dull and unfunny . The few saving assets are some beautiful cinematography ( even though it wasn't shot anywhere near New England ) and appealing performances by Alan Arkin ( nominated for this ) and John Phillip Law ( blue eyes blazing ) . Seriously - - THIS was nominated for Best Picture ? ? ? I realize it was a big hit at the time of its release but it doesn't age well at all . I'm being generous by giving this a 3 .
478603	463200	190865	3.0	Vertical Crap	Mountain climber Robin Tunney and two other stock characters , are trapped in an avalanche on a huge montain ( K-4 ) . It's up to her brother ( Chris O'Donnell ) and other stock characters to save them . Not a bad premise . . . unfortunately it's ruined by many things - - - Lousy dialogue - the lines were groan-inducing , totally predictable and boring ; every single person was a stock characters seen in other disaster movies ; and the opening set-up takes a full 40 dull minutes to get started ( the movie runs 2 hr 10 min ) . The scenery is beautiful ( wide screen viewing is essential ) and there are a few really exciting , gripping action sequences but that's only 20 minutes out of a 2 hr + film . Acting - - Tunney does very well with her victim role ; Bill Paxton can do his villain role in his sleep ( and he does ) ; Scott Glenn does what he can with his wise , old mountain climbing man role ( unfortunately , the dialogue sinks him ) . As for O'Donnell - - he's an extremely good-looking man with a nice body - - but he can't act . He's blander than usual in this film and I had no interest in him or his character after a while . If you want to see a good , suspenseful montain-climbing film , rent " Cliffhanger " .
478971	463200	94715	3.0	Just horrid	Film follows the friendship of two very different women over the course of their lives - - loud , tacky , driven CC ( Bette Midler ) and quiet , demure Hilary ( Barbara Hershey ) . CC will do everything to become an actress and singer - - Hilary isn't sure what she wants . This is commonly referred to as a " chick flick " . Now I LIKE those types of movies and I think Midler and Hershey are great actresses ( and singer in Midler's case ) but I REALLY hated this film . It starts off OK but slowly falls to pieces . At the halfway point I started to truly despise this movie . There's HORRIBLE dialogue and such clichéd situations and characters that I was literally rolling my eyes a few times . I began to hate it more and more and by the end I was fed up completely . The movie is so completely obvious I was truly shocked . When a character is diagnosed with a fatal disease I came close to throwing something at my TV screen . And it takes her FOREVER to die ! The movie has at least three different endings - - all bad - - and the REAL ending is so horribly manipulative I was stunned ! Many people said they cried at the end - - I did too - - tears of JOY that this dreck was finally OVER ! ! ! It's really astounding that people think this is a great movie . It WAS a huge hit in 1988 - - that's kind of sad . I'm giving it a 3 instead of a 1 for a few reasons - - It was great to see Lainine Kazan and John Heard ( although they're given nothing to do ) ; " Wind Beneath My Wings " is a great song ; and Hershey and Midler were good despite the material . Midler especially made the most of her few good lines . But this is a morbid , sick , depressing and insulting movie . Avoid it like the plague !
477523	463200	67124	3.0	Pretty poor	" Comedy " about two warring Mafia gangs in Brooklyn . Purportedly the original book is hilarious and this movie has a great cast - - but something went wrong . The jokes aren't very funny and the cast just seems to be unable to put across the punchlines . Flat direction doesn't help either . I'm only giving it a 3 for Leigh-Taylor Young and Robert DeNiro ( who are both very good and play a very appealing couple ) and Jo Van Fleet who has the movie's only funny lines in a very broad , over the top , amusing manner . But , all in all , this really isn't worth seeing .
478589	463200	74967	3.0	Repulsive	Originally aired as an ABC Movie of the Week . This involves two young innocent female college students who are railroaded into a prison camp in a little Southern town . They aren't allowed phone calls and nobody knows they're there . What follows is rape , torture , beatings , humiliation and degradation leading to a very disturbing conclusion . The TV version was ( for its time ) grim . No nudity and the beatings were pretty tame but the overall feeling of sleaziness wore one down . The unrated version is even worse - - there's plentiful nudity , the violence is extreme and , in one particularly disgusting sequence , we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard " uses " her . YUCK ! There's nothing wrong with exploitation films but this one just goes over the brink . You get the feeling that the filmmakers enjoy having these poor women being tortured and degraded - - all this is shoved in your face like you're supposed to enjoy it . The needlessly downbeat ending doesn't help . I'm giving it a 3 because the acting is good - - but that actually makes the movie harder to watch . A sick , sleazy film . Not recommended .
479111	463200	53219	4.0	Pretty silly , and unnecessary sequel	Like father , like son . This is a black & white sequel to the color original . The sone of the originals ' father starts the same experiments as his father and the same thing happens to him . The acting is pretty good ( Price and Halsey do a very good job ) but the makeup on Halsey is laughable , the plot has nothing fresh or original to it and it's nowhere near as intelligent as the original . A pretty dull little film . For Vincent Price completists only . Even the sequel after this " Revenge of the Fly " was better !
478564	463200	86946	4.0	I never liked hip-hop so obviously I didn't like this	Hilariously obvious " drama " about a bunch of high school ( I think ) kids who enjoy non-stop hip-hop , break dancing , graffiti and trying to become a dj at the Roxy - - or something . To be totally honest I was so bored I forgot ! Even people who love the music agree this movie is terribly acted and - - as a drama - - failed dismally . We're supposed to find this kids likable and nice . I found them bland and boring . The one that I REALLY hated was Ramon . He does graffiti on subway trains and this is looked upon as great . Excuse me ? He's defacing public property that isn't his to begin with . Also these " great " kids tap into the city's electricity so they can hold a big dance party at an abandoned building . Uh huh . So we're supposed to find a bunch of law breakers lovable and fun . I could forgive all that if the music was good but I can't stand hip hop . The songs were - - at best - - mediocre and they were nonstop ! they're ALWAYS playing to the point that I was fast-forwarding through the many endless music numbers . ( Cut out the music and you got maybe a 30 minute movie - - maybe ) There are a few imaginative numbers - - the subway dance fight , a truly funny Santa number and the climatic Roxy show . If you love hip hop here's your movie . But it you're looking for good drama mixed in - - forget it . Also HOW did this get a PG rating ? There's an incredible amount of swearing in this .
477939	463200	102299	4.0	Prententious , pretentious , pretentious	Nick ( Kevin Anderson ) goes back to his hometown to take care of his dying mother ( Kim Novak ) . There he encounters an old college buddy ( Bill Pullman ) and his beautiful wife ( Pamela Gidley ) . He also gets involved with a 40 year old sex murder that may have something to do with him . . . I caught this in a theatre back in 1991 . It was part of the Boston Film Festival and I had heard it had some incredibly beautiful cinematography . Well - - it does . It just doesn't have much of a story to go with it . Also the film moves so SLOWLY - - I literally fell asleep ! Seeing it again 14 years later , I fell asleep AGAIN ! This film is dull and slow . It's one of those art films full of strange characters who act oddly and mutter obscure dialogue ( especially the police chief ) . Gorgeous images don't make up for the leaden pace . Acting doesn't help . Anderson ( a good actor ) acts terrible here . He appears to be drugged out at all times . Gidley TRIES to give a good performance but she's given nothing to work with . Pullman is the only one who pulls off a good job . Novak is ( sadly ) wasted and reduced to being bed ridden and screaming for no good reason . Also watch the part where the police chief has the longest urination sequence in cinema history . Why it's there I have no idea but at least it's somewhat funny . Otherwise this is a dull , slow-moving bore . Avoid .
478702	463200	261392	4.0	More misses than hits	The idea was fun ( Jay and Silent Bob traveling to Hollywood to try and stop a movie being made ) but it doesn't work . There are plenty of jokes but for every good one there are five or six that fall flat . Also , to get most of the jokes you have to have seen every Kevin Smith movie ever made . If you haven't , you'll be lost . The plot rambles all over the place . . . there are constant detours that just make no sense . The cameos by many actors sometimes work - - but more often than not the actors seem embarrassed by what they're doing . The only really funny one involves Ben Affleck and Matt Damon . Also we ( unfortunately ) get Jason Lee - - unattractive as always and giving another bad performance . Also we see director / writer Kevin Smith's fascination with young , gorgeous women in tight-fitting clothes walking around in slow motion - - in fact , we're treated to this THREE TIMES ! ! ! Keep your sexual fantasies out of your movies next time , OK Kevin ? And ( since it's a Kevin Smith ) a certain four-letter work beginning with " f " is uttered about 100 times - - in a 90 minute movie . I'd like to see if he could write a script NOT using that word . Probably not . I'm not recommending this ( of course ) but some of the jokes do work and I did get a kick out of the constant references to the crap Miramax cranks out . Still , there is an audience for this . . . so if it looks good to you , you might like it .
477967	463200	106400	4.0	Silly	I have to admit that I've never seen a full episode of the TV series . I've seen bits and pieces of enough to know the basic premise and the characters . This is just to let you know that I'm reviewing it without comparing it to the TV series . But still - - with the silly premise who ever thought this would work as a full length film ? The Clampetts strike oil , become billionaires and move to Beverly Hills . An evil bank assistant ( Rob Schneider ) and his girlfriend ( Lea Thompson ) plan to swindle them out of it all . There's very little plot , even for 90 minutes . There are some good jokes but most range from lame to insultingly stupid . It's all up to the actors to carry this off . Luckily , they're up to it . Deidrich Bader is very good as dumb as dirt Jethro ( and his sister ) - - he's full of life , engaging and has a great smile . Dabney Coleman is good but given nothing to work with as Mr . Drysdale . Erika Eleniack is cute and perky as Elly May - - she can't act but she was hired for her body not comedic talent . Cloris Leachman is good but a little too loud as Granny . Lilly Tomlin is hysterical as Miss Hathaway - - she looks great and provides the few true laughs in the film . The late Jim Varney is surprisingly very good as Jed - - who would have thought ? Schneider and Thompson try to be funny but their material is very poor . Guest appearances by Buddy Ebsen , Dolly Parton and Zsa Zsa Gabor ( in a VERY dated joke ) don't help . With a better script this could have been great . As it is , it's almost worth seeing for the actors ( especially Tomlin ) . Maybe the TV series is better . . .
477270	463200	78087	5.0	Can't say I liked it . . .	The government hires a scientist ( Kevin McCarthy ) to develop man-eating piranhas to use in combat ( ? ? ? ? ) . Unfortunately they escape into a public stream . . . which runs into a summer camp , a resort and then the ocean . Can Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies stop the creatures ? This is a Roger Corman production with all his trademarks - - stupid script , bad acting , pointless nudity , bad dialogue and some truly pathetic special effects ( the piranhas themselves are obviously cardboard cutouts in a few shots ) . Purportedly a spoof on " Jaws " but ( aside from a few lines ) I didn't find this funny . It does move quickly but the plot is just too ridiculous ( and not funny ) to be taken seriously . Also the piranha attacks are VERY vicious and bloody and they show them attacking ( and killing ) children . I draw the line when any horror movie needlessly throws in children being killed for " entertainment " . I also fail to see how that is funny . Also it has a very downbeat ending . It is well directed by Joe Dante and some reasonably OK acting helps . Dillman is pretty good but Menzies just basically says her lines with a blank face . Corman regulars Paul Bartel and Dick Miller pops up but they're not even remotely funny . However Barbara Steele appears as Dr . Mengers and she's having a whale of a time with her role . She plays it with just perfectly - - smiling at the audience while acting seriously . I found this too violent to enjoy and too stupid to take seriously but this does have an audience . There is one exchange that made me laugh out loud : " Sir the piranhas . . . " " What about the piranhas ? " " They're eating the guests sir " .
477957	463200	66550	5.0	Terrible direction , stupid script but sometimes it works	A white bigot ( Godfrey Cambridge ) wakes up one morning to find himself a black man . Good idea , horrible execution . The script hits all the jokes you expect and then goes nowhere . The dialogue is terrible - - people don't talk like that ! Also , there's no ending - - the film just stops . And Van Peebles direction is annoying beyond belief . Yes , I realize he was one of the first black independent directors - - it does NOT make him a good director though . He puts annoying music on the soundtrack without rhyme or reason . . . sometimes it almost drowns out the actors ! The color filters he uses don't help at all and scenes go on WAY too long . He's worse than Spike Lee ( and that's saying a lot ) . Still , some of the jokes are very funny and the film makes a strong comment against racism . Also Godfrey Cambridge gives a wonderful performance - - he has some horrible dialogue , but he pulls it off . The main problems here - - the direction , the script and boy is it dated ! However not Van Peebles worst movie - - that goes to " Sweet Sweetbacks Bada Song " .
479073	463200	83336	5.0	Too smart for its own good	SPOILER BEGINSA rich couple are brutally murdered when they take a little nighttime stroll through the bad part of NYC . Detective Albert Finney is called in to investigate . It turns out the murderers aren't even human - - they're super intelligent wolves just trying to protect their hunting ground . But it seems the city plans to demolish their area to make room for apartment buildings . . . and the wolves aren't happy about that . This movie has good things - - it's well-directed ; Gregory Hines attacks his role and has fun with it ; Edward James Olmos has a surprising nude scene and there is some very good special effects showing how the wolves see things . But , ultimately , this movie doesn't work . It's a " message " horror film - - it tries to give us a little moral message about civilization , the environment , Indians . . . You know , I go to horror films to be scared NOT have messages shoved down my throat . Also the film is VERY slow ( I fast-forwarded through a lot of it ) ; Albert Finney looks like he's drunk most of the time and the surreal touches just annoyed me . And , worst of all , the wolfen weren't scary ! They looked kind of cute and cuddly not frightening . This movie was dumped by the studio on its release . It's easy to see why . Horror fans would be bored and people who like message movies wouldn't see a movie like this . Basically this is an interesting misfire . I give it a 5 .
479098	463200	74512	5.0	Sad to say but Hitchcock's last is one of his worst	Movie about a couple - - Blanche ( Barbara Harris ) and George ( Bruce Dern ) - - searching for the long-lost nephew of a very rich woman . Unfortunately they get involved with two kidnappers - - Adamson ( William Devane ) and Fran ( Karen Black ) - - and Adamson is VERY evil . Hitchcock's heart wasn't in this one - - and it shows . He was in ill health all during the shot and kept butting heads with Black and Devane - - they were Method actors ( which Hitchcock hated ) and drove him crazy asking what their motivations were for every scene . He got along well with Harris and Dern though . The plot itself is ( to put it nicely ) pretty light-weight and needlessly convoluted . Also the film is indifferently shot ( only a few sequences look even remotely good ) and it's far too long . To be honest , I was dozing off halfway through ! The only things keeping this from being a total bomb are good performances by Harris and Dern , a hair-raising ride in a car with no brakes down a twisting road , John Williams ' jokey score and Harris ' final wink at the camera . But , all in all , this is overlong , boring and sub-par piece of work . Hitch should have stopped with " Frenzy " ( 1972 ) . I can only give this a 5 .
479267	463200	9968	5.0	Dated and overdone	A kind Chinese man ( Richard Barthelmess - - who's white ) travels from China to London to teach peace and kindness to white men . Years later he lives in the Limehouse section of London - - a real slum . He's depressed but not beaten down . He meets sweet , innocent Lucy ( Lillian Gish ) who is beaten and whipped by her cruel father ( Donald Crisp ) . She finds friendship with Barthlemess - - but her evil , racist father might find out . . . For 1919 this must have been pretty racy . Even suggesting a friendship between a Chinese man and a white girl was pretty extreme . Today it's laughably dated and WAY overdone . It's also racist in itself - - Barthelmess plays a Chinese man and is constantly referred to as " the Yellow Man " in the title cards . Still , for its era , this was pretty brave . Also this is , for director D . W . Griffith , a small quiet film - - he was used to doing epics . It is well-directed and the color filters help . Gish overacts a LOT as does Crisp - - they're hard to take seriously . Barthelmess , on the other hand , underacts like he's afraid to show any emotion . So , for its time , it's daring but it just doesn't hold up . I give it a 5 .
478652	463200	233469	6.0	Typical	Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a fireman ( for no particular reason that I could see ) , whose wife and kid are accidentally killed in a Colombian terrorist attack . 10 minutes later he's in Columbia searching for the terrorist . Typical Arnie film but very fast-moving with tons of fights , explosions , gun play , really implausible situations and loads on violence . But it's hard to watch a Hollywood film about terrorists after the Sept 11 tragedy . In fact , it's downright uncomfortable . All in all it's OK but very familar and really silly . There was a good twist at the end though . One thing - - Arnie is 55 and looks it . Isn't he getting a little too old to be doing this ? In some shots he looks terrible !
478689	463200	52427	6.0	Kids might like it	Story about Tom Thumb ( Russ Tamblyn ) who is no bigger than someone's thumb . He gets involved with two bumbling crooks ( Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers ) and such . Kids might like it but this is pretty hard going . Basically this is more of a musical than anything else . The songs are ( to be nice ) unmemorable and annoying . It got to the point that I was dreading each song - - and there are LOTS of them ! The story ( what there is of it ) is very slight and the lapses in logic were puzzling even for a fairy tale movie . Terry-Thomas ( chewing the scenery ) and Peter Sellers were stupid and unfunny and Alan Young and June Thorburn were unbelievably bland as young lovers . On the plus side Tamblyn was good in the title role , the dances are colorful and there's some really cool stop motion animation with Tom's toys . So kids will probably like this ( although they might howl at the stop motion animation which looks clumsy next to CGI ) but I was bored silly and couldn't wait for this to be over . I give it a 6 .
479326	463200	95270	6.0	Doesn't age well	I loved this film back in 1988 . . . 13 years later I don't . John Waters first PG rated film was considered fresh , innovative and funny back then . It was . . . back then . It just doesn't hold up well . The plot is ( to put it mildly ) thin , all the characters are skin-deep and the jokes are either forced and / or unfunny . The small roles filled by various stars are sometimes good ( Debbie Harry is wonderful ) but , most of the time , are really off ( Sonny Bono ? ? ? Pia Zadora ? ? ? ! ! ! ? ? ) . Also Waters isn't such a great director - - some of the sequences are horribly staged and he does NOT know how the shoot dances . Remember , his films are well-known for their content not their cinematic quality . What keeps this film going is a great soundtrack ( all from the early 60s when the movie takes place ) , fun hairstyles & costumes and some very good acting . Divine ( in , sadly , his last role ) is fun as Edna Turnblad , Tracey's harried mother . As Tracey herself , Ricki Lake is perfect . She's plump , pretty and absolutely adorable . Colleen Fitzpatrick is also good as Amber , a rich witch . Ruth Brown is having a whale of a time playing Motormouth Maybell ( interesting clothes Ruth ! ) . The only real bad performance is by Michael St . Gerard ( notice his career went nowhere after this ) . He's handsome and a dead ringer for Elvis ( who he played in a 1990 TV mini ) but bland . Of course , the script doesn't give him much to do . Considered to be Waters ' most accessible ( I agree ) and best ( I disagree ) film . Give me " Pink Flamingoes " or " Serial Mom " anyday over this !
479514	463200	60818	6.0	Silly	Pretty dumb comedy about neglected wife Natalie Wood becoming a kleptomaniac to get her husband's ( Ian Bannen's ) attention . She even sees a psychiatrist ( a very annoying Dick Shawn ) to try to be cured . Then she robs her husband's bank and things just get sillier . . . This isn't a total bomb . It's beautifully photographed - - I've never seen NYC look like this ; the settings and costumes are incredible ; Wood is just gorgeous and Bannen is handsome and actually quite amusing as her husband . But two things destroy this - - the script and Shawn . Shawn is WAY over the top in his performance - - he's not funny just annoying . The script is pretty poor - - there are a few good parts here and there but most of the comedy is just BAD ! ! ! Wood and Bannen give it their all but the material just isn't there . The rest of the cast just overacts ( horribly ) . It leads to a " happy " ending which had me rolling my eyes . So it's worth seeing for Wood , Bannen , the cinematography ( letter boxing is a must ) and some mildly humorous material . Otherwise - - forget it . I give it a 6 .
478266	463200	57197	6.0	Great special effects	Ray Harryhausen's special effects are the only reason to see the movie . The script is somewhat literate but boring , the acting is pretty bad ( although some people were dubbed over ) and it doesn't really end . But when Harryhausen's creations are on-screen , the movie is fantastic . There are some quibbles - - some of these creatures move REAL slow and the harpies don't look anything like harpies . But these are minor points . The stop-motion animation is flawless and the climatic fight with skeletons is truly amazing . Worth seeing , but don't go out of your way to see it .
477728	463200	416315	6.0	It's OK - - that's about it	Purportedly based on fact story set in Australia in 1999 . Three likable 20 somethings - - Ben ( Nathan Phillips ) , Liz ( Cassandra Magarth ) and Kristy ( Kertie Morassi ) - - go to Wolf Creek . It's a remote part of Australia where a meteor had landed . The car breaks down and they're stuck in the middle of nowhere . Then , after dark , a local man shows up and says he'll help them . . . and then the nightmare begins . I can't understand why there's so much hype surrounding this . It IS gory and brutal . . . but nothing special . I've seen this story before and saying it's based on real events doesn't make it anymore different . It's a little - - only a LITTLbetter than similar American horror flicks . It's done with the same shaky camera-work and washed out color - - but it DOES have three characters you actually like and who have personalities , unlike the cardboard cutouts that most American horror films have . It works in the films favor because when the violence starts it really is hard to watch . You actually like and know these people - - seeing them tortured is horrifying . The film one fatal flaw is it takes a full hour before anything happens - - everything in that first hour is just the three main people talking and interacting . I have nothing against character development - - but a full HOUR ? ? ? They're all pretty good in their roles so that makes it somewhat interesting . Phillips is very handsome , buff and cheerful as Ben - - Magarth is strong , intelligent and completely convincing - - Morassi unfortunately is given the victim role so she has little to do but scream and whimper . By the time everything kicked in I was more than ready for it . Be warned the violence is STRONG and incredibly bloody - - three people walk out when I went to see it . So it's OK - - but nothing great or groundbreaking . I give this a marginal recommendation to horror fans - - all others stay away .
477317	463200	278435	6.0	By the numbers , but watchable	Beautiful waitress Slim ( Jennifer Lopez ) meets Mitch ( tall , handsome , muscular Billy Campbell ) . In the space of 20 minutes screen time ( along with silly little title cards ) , they fall in love , get married , buy a house and have a kid who is about 6 when the story really begins . Turns out that Mitch is cheating on Slim . When she confronts him with evidence he beats her ( within a PG-13 rating ) . She tries to run , but he always finds her . What will she do ? Beat the crap out of him ! An OK thriller but it has gaping plot holes and huge implausibilities - - for instance , Campbell would cheat on sexy , beautiful Lopez ? ? ? ? ? Come on ! He also finds her way too easily each time she runs away and , at the climax , she learns how to break into his house and totally fix it so he can't get away . Also seeing small , thin Lopez beat up Campbell looks more than a little laughable and it does seem to trivialize wife beating . I have a definite problem with that . Still , it's not too bad . Lopez is good and Campbell ( cast totally against type ) is exceptional . There's also strong supporting roles from Juliette Lewis and Dan Futterman . So , an OK movie . Wait for the DVD or video .
479305	463200	36172	6.0	It's just OK	During the 1940s housing shortage in Washington DC , Constance Milligan ( Jean Arthur ) decides to take in a boarder to help the war effort . Benjamin Dingle ( Charles Coburn ) moves in and he , in turn , invites hunky Joe Carter ( Joel McCrea ) to move in . Complications ensure . It's beyond me why this is considered a classic . It's not a bad movie just an OK movie . It does have lots of things going for it : Arthur is just wonderful - - and beautiful ; Coburn is a delight ( he won an Oscar for this ) ; it's well-directed and some of the romance works . But I never believed the story for one second and I didn't find this that funny at all - - I thought most of the jokes fell flat . Arthur and Coburn tried by McCrea ( never a good actor ) just could not do comedy . He did wonderfully in one scene ( his expressions when Colburn introduces him to Arthur are quite funny ) but he was his usual expressionless self the rest of the movie . He was handsome and hunky - - that was about it . Also the ending was just REALLY going too far . I realize I'm in a minority here but I just thought this was so-so . I can truthfully only give this a 6 .
478055	463200	90223	6.0	Well acted but ridiculously predictable	Harry MacKenzie ( Gene Hackman ) leaves wife Kate ( Ellen Burstyn ) for waitress Audrey Minelli ( Ann-Margret ) . This causes huge complications with his adult children Sunny ( Amy Madigan ) and Helen ( Ally Sheedy ) . Stephen Lang and Brian Dennehy throw in strong supporting performances . This is well made and everything . . . but this has been done to death before and this adds nothing new . Aside from some swearing ( the R rating for this is not deserved ) this plays like a made for TV movie . I knew what was coming constantly all through the movie and quickly tired of it . It doesn't even have a conclusion ! It just sort of stops . ( One of my friends said , " I can't say if I like it or not until I see the end ! " ) All the acting was great - - especially Burstyn , Ann-Margret and Madigan ( she was Oscar nominated for this one ) but all the great acting in the world can't overcome the predictable storyline . If you're a sucker for Lifetime movies or predictable family dramas this is right up your alley . This came and went quickly in 1985 and is now ( rightfully ) forgotten . I believe Ann-Margret was asked about this a few years back in an interview and she couldn't remember doing it ! That should tell you something . I give it a 6 .
478383	463200	257076	6.0	Just about what you'd expect	" S . W . A . T . " was a by the numbers TV cop show from the 70s . It only lasted one season and its only claims to fame are that it had a young Robert Urich in its cast and had a really catchy theme song . The movie isn't much better than the show but it's not a total washout . Jim Street ( Colin Farrell ) and his partner Gamble ( Jeremy Renner ) are part of SWAT and on a mission . Gamble ignores a direct order and a hostage is wounded . Gamble is fired from SWAT and Street is sent to cage duty . Six months later Lt . Dan " hondo " Harrelson ( Samuel L . Jackson ) starts to head SWAT . He puts Street back on along with a few others ( the only standout is LL Cool J ) and they go into training . Then a vicious French killer ( horribly played by Olivier Martinez ) raises hell in L . A . and SWAT may have more than they can handle on their hands . As you can see this is , plotwise , an hour-long TV cop show extended to 2 hours . Ever twist and turn was boringly predictable . And we have too loud rock songs played over all the action sequences along with ear-splitting gun shots . Also there's tons of casual violence but no blood and gore ( maybe that's how it got by with a PG-13 ) and a surprising amount of swearing ( thank you " NYPD Blue " ) . Still , the dialogue wasn't half bad ; the action sequences were quick , loud and full of energy and everybody gives a good performance ( especially Farrell and Jackson ) . So , it's nothing new . . . but you could do worse . Not a film for small kids though .
479201	463200	95652	7.0	Interesting but this movie has problems	Allan Mann ( Jason Beghe ) becomes paralyzed from the neck down after a car hits him . He falls into a deep depression until a scientist friend ( John Pankow ) gets him a trained monkey named Ella ( Boo ) to help him . Allan also begins to fall in love with Ella's trainer ( Kate McNeil ) . . . but Ella begins to get very attached to Allan - - TOO attached . This was supposed to be director / writer George Romero's comeback film . He said the studio loved it and was going to put a big promotional push behind it . But , for whatever reason , when this came out in the summer of 1988 the studio just dumped it . There was next to no ads for it or coming attractions . Romero remains bitter about it to this day . It's too bad this film was just ignored . It's no masterpiece but it isn't bad . The movie does have problems - - it's far too long ( almost two hours ) , the ending goes on forever and some of the plot is really hard to believe ( I thought the psychic link between Allan and Ella was really stupid ) . Also the POV by the monkey was annoying and overused and there's a REAL embarrassing sex scene between Beghe and McNeil . Still I do like this movie . As I said it's too long but I was never really bored . Beghe is excellent in a very difficult role ; Pankow nicely underplays the scientist and McNeil is fresh and appealing . Also Boo ( who plays Ella ) is a good " actor " . I realize she was just trained for her role but the expressions on her face and body movement was incredible . The plot is also quite interesting - - until the end when it just strains credibility . So not a bad film or a good one but worth catching . I give it a 7 .
477922	463200	39080	7.0	Not bad	In 1890 England , Sydney Greenstreet is forced to retire as the chief of Scotland Yard . It seems he accidentally sent an innocent man to be hanged . He's more than upset over this . Then an seemingly " perfect " murder baffles the Yard and Greenstreet is called in again . But can even he find out the murderer ? Also Peter Lorre is along as his best friend . This was the ( I believe ) 9th and last teaming of Greenstreet and Lorre - - they had made a number of films together after they met doing " Casablanca " . It was director Don Seigel's first film . All in all , it's a pretty good murder mystery . It's VERY atmospheric ( the streets are always covered in fog ) and moves nicely . Shot in b & w it takes place always at night and in dark , gloomy rooms - - it gives the film an appropriately grim feel . Lorre is very good in his small role . However Greenstreet is not - - he seems tired and listless . His face always has the same grim look on it . When he tries to register surprise in one scene he fails miserably . It's pretty well-written but I had already figured out what was going on long before the ending . Still , it's entertaining enough . Worth seeing if it's on TV - - but don't go out of your way .
478804	463200	105151	7.0	Good , but not great	An executive at a movie studio ( Tim Robbins ) accidentally kills a writer who he thinks is harassing him . He tries to cover it up . Also his job at the studio is in jeopardy as he's competing with a younger , aggressive man ( Peter Gallagher ) . This was Altman's first Hollywood film after a 12 year absence ( " Popeye effectively stopped his career ) . At first I hated this movie . Very cold , VERY cynical with not one likable character in it . Slowly , though , it won me over . Basically , it's a satire of Hollywood and movie making . . . but a very vicious one . The script is great ( there are countless great lines ) and Altman does his usual great directing job . . . I love the opening 10-15 minutes which is done without any cutaways - - just one long shot . It's just too cruel at times . The acting is ( with one exception ) fine . Gallagher is dead on perfect as the young hot-shot ( he was in his 30s when he did this but he looks in his 20s ) . Robbins , however , is a disappointment . He has a blank , depressed look on his face during most of the movie and sleepwalks through his role . In a way that's a good thing . If he had been real good and convincing in the role this would have been unwatchable . Also Whoppi Goldberg is hysterical as a police officer investigating the case - - watch for the scene with her and a tampon ! Also a huge amount of Hollywood actors appear playing themselves . It's a lot of fun in certain scenes playing " who's in this one " ? So it's good , but Altman has done better . . . like " MASH " and " Nashville " . However , this isn't as bad as his worst film ( " Popeye " ) . So , I ultimately liked it , but the first half was a trial to sit through . I give it a 7 .
478500	463200	17739	7.0	Creaky but somewhat fun silent film	An old man ( Cyrus West ) dies accusing his relatives of hovering over him - - like cats over a canary . 20 years after his death his relatives get together as his will is read in his creepy mansion on a dark and windy night at midnight ( of course ) . One person gets all the money and estate - - unless they are proved insane . And how about the escaped lunatic from the nearby asylum . . . ? This is probably one of the first ( if not THE first ) movie about the reading of the will , a dark and ( purportedly ) haunted house and people being murdered . Plotwise it's nothing new and contains some terribly unfunny " comedy " . Still it's worth catching . It's very well directed by Paul Leni ( the juxtaposing of images was clever ) and he has fun with the title cards ( see how " HELP ! " is done ) . The acting is a little bit overdone ( but that's common in silent films ) and star Laura La Plante is pretty good . I saw the restored print ( which is still in pretty bad shape ) and it has an excellent music score that helps too . So , worth catching . No great shakes though .
478454	463200	435653	7.0	An actually very good horror flick	SPOILERS After the funeral of a man three of his buddies - - Harris ( Dominic Purcell ) , Kira ( Josie Maren ) and Sid ( Marcus Thomas ) - - get drunk and dance on some graves in a graveyard late at night . It turns out they unwittingly resurrected some evil ghosts who go after the people who disturbed them . This was barely released back in 2006 but it actually isn't half bad . The bad points are : the movie has those stupid jump scares ; some of the acting is pretty bad ; it has a totally pointless beginning ( which the director rightly protested ) and a frustrating ending . The good : there are likable characters ; there's some good acting ; the story sounds far-fetched but they put it across and it has some VERY scary moments . The ghosts aren't actually even seen till the end and believe me - - they are frightening ! There are three horrific standouts here : the first view of the ghost in Harris ' bed , a sequence in a graveyard halfway through and the all out assault at the end . The special effects are excellent and it truly scared me - - there aren't many films I can say that about ! Some bad acting by Purcell ( who can be good ) lessens the full effect but everybody else is pretty good ( especially Clare Kramer as Harris ' wife ) . So a good strong ghost movie . Turn off all the lights and pop this into the DVD player ! I give it a 7 .
477782	463200	113270	7.0	Not good but not bad	I originally caught this back in 1996 in its one week run at a movie theatre . I was under impressed by it and my feelings haven't much changed . Documentary about the infamous Edward D . Wood Jr . covering his life and movies . There are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him . They include : Vampira , Dolores Fuller , Bela Lugosi Jr . , Loretta King , Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco . Interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations . It is interesting ( somewhat ) but was this really needed ? I've seen all of Wood's films and they're just terrible . Wood had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out . I wouldn't say he was the worst director ever but he's down there . Do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker ? I do like the fact that they didn't try to make Wood out to be some sort of saint . More than a few of those interviewed ( especially Lugosi Jr . ) pretty much hated the man and it comes through loud and clear . Also they totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s . Still it's of interest if you're a Wood fan . The best interviews are with Vampira ( who tears Wood apart ) and Dolores Fuller ( a long time girlfriend ) .
478745	463200	65854	7.0	Good horror anthology	Four stories written by Robert Bloch about various people who live in a beautiful , old mansion and what happens to them . The first has Denholm Elliott as a novelist who sees the killer he's writing about come to life . Some spooky moments and the twist at the end was good . The second has Peter Cushing becoming obsessed with a wax figure resembling his dead wife . The third has Christopher Lee who has a child ( Chloe Franks ) and is scared of her . It all leads up to a pretty scary ending ( although the ending in the story was MUCH worse ) . The last is an out and out comedy with Jon Petwee and Ingrid Pitt ( both chewing the scenery ) and a cape that turns people into vampires ! There's also a cute line about Christopher Lee playing Dracula . This is a good horror anthology - - nothing terrifying but the first one and the ending of the third gave me a few pleasurable little chills . Also the fourth one is actually very funny and Pitt makes a VERY sexy vampire ! Also the house itself looks beautiful . . . and very creepy . It's well-directed with some nice atmospheric touches . A very good and unusual movie score too . All in all a good little horror anthology well worth seeking out . Try to see it on DVthe Lions Gate one looks fantastic with strong colors and great sound .
479546	463200	47472	7.0	Great musical with some SERIOUS problems	In the 1850s a man ( Howard Keel ) who lives with his six brothers out in the middle of nowhere takes a bride ( Jane Powell ) . He expects her to be a maid , housecleaner , cook , etc . She does but makes all seven of the guys dress nicely , eat correctly and have good manners . Soon the six brothers fall in love with some town girls . So Howard tells them go off and kidnap them ( ! ! ) They do and the girls fall in love with them ( ! ! ! ! ! ) OK - - this film has good things - - - some absolutely beautiful , if fake , scenery ; some pretty good songs ; an incredible barnraising sequence ( the dancing is unbelievable ) and it's shot in bright color and widescreen . BUT . . . the film has an annoying boys will be boys attitude and some really upsetting violence ( for a musical ) - - during the barnraising sequence especially . Also there's horrible back projection ( especially when Keel takes Powell to his house ) and a just astonishing hatred of women . We're supposed to find it amusing that the seven guys KIDNAP the women ( after beating their boyfriends senseless ) and the women fall in love ! Yeah yeah I know it was made in the 1950s but that doesn't excuse it . I had a LOT of problems with that . Still I'm giving it a 7 for the dancing alone .
478678	463200	60668	7.0	I haven't the slightest idea of what this is about but it works !	This takes place in 1808 in an insane asylum . The Marquis de Sade ( Patrick Mage ) puts on a play of an assassination for an audience . He uses the other inmates as actors . Things slowly get out of hand leading to a truly horrifying ending . I first caught this way back in 1980 at a center for adult education . It was a video of the movie shown for free . The picture was murky and the sound was terrible . Still I sat through it . I just caught it again ( over 20 years later ) on cable . This time I could see and hear it clearly . I'm not going to pretend that I understand what this is about , aside from the basic premise about a bunch of inmates putting on a play , and I do know it was based on a stage play . Still , I watched all 2 hours . The acting is great across the board but Magee , Ian Richardson and Glenda Jackson ( in her major film debut ) are exceptional . The movie is disturbing - - I realize these are all actors playing roles but they're so good that you believe everything you're seeing . The direction also is masterful - - it opens up the play cinematically . It has an R rating but that's mostly for subject matter and a brief nude scene with Richardson . This isn't for everybody - - some people will be bored silly by it - - but for those who like challenging movies this fits the bill . The ending is very disturbing . I give it a 7 .
477486	463200	60182	7.0	Very good	True life story . George and Joy Adamson ( Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna ) live in the wilderness in Kenya . In self defense , George kills a lion and his mate only to find they were protecting their three cubs . He and his wife decide to raise the cubs . They give two of them away to zoos , but can't part with Elsa , a lioness . But then they realize they can't keep her and don't want to put her in a zoo . Can they help her live in the wild ? I read the book " Born Free " when I was in grammar school in the 70s and loved it . I also vaguely remember seeing the movie on TV ( and liking it ) and the very short-lived ( 13 episodes ) series in the early 70s . Also the song was a big hit in the mid 60s and again in the early 70s . But I had forgotten all about it until it popped up on TCM . I decided to tune in and loved it ! The movie was shot beautifully on location in Kenya ( where it took place ) . Wide screen viewing is essential for this one . Also , Travers and McKenna were a real-life couple when they did this film ( in fact they remained married until his death in 1994 ) and there devotion to each other comes through loud and clear . Also the lions ( male and female ) are SO cute when they're cubs and even beautiful as they get older . Elsa herself was portrayed by a number of different lionesses but you can't tell the difference . And Travers and McKenna worked with all the animals for 2 weeks before filming so they all interact together perfectly . This is perfect family viewing - - adults will adore it as much as the kids . I'm only giving it a 7 for a few reasons - - there isn't much of a story and the film DOES drag a little . Also the cute little shots of the cubs get a little bit much . Yeah they are adorable , but it got to the point that I thought the filmmakers were purposely shoving them in our faces to get us to go " awwwwwwww " ! A little bit too cute for my tastes . Still it's a great film and the music in this one is fantastic ( and Oscar-winning ) . Also I defy anyone not to cry during the final sequence - - it even got to me and I'm the last person to cry at movies like this . A very good family film . See it !
478213	463200	174856	7.0	Well-done with great acting	The only problem with this film is it's length . . . it's 2 hours - - way too long . But the basic true story and the acting ( especially by Washington ) keep it interesting . Worth seeing - - just don't accept it as gospel truth , and be prepared for the length .
478337	463200	67217	7.0	A little overdone but good	PLOT SPOILERS ! ! ! ! Dr . Boch ( George C . Scott ) is the chief of medicine at a major NYC hospital . He's left his wife , his children have disowned him , he's impotent , drinks a lot and contemplates suicide . Also there's a killer roaming the hospital . Then he meets VERY strange Barbara ( Diana Rigg ) and falls in love . She wants him to run away with her - - but can he completely give up on his old life and start a new one ? Very strange movie with an Oscar winning script by Paddy Chayefsky . It presents a suicidal main character and shows us a hospital full of overworked nurses and doctors that is run incompetently . It manages ( somehow ) to actually make this seem pretty funny . It's not laugh out loud humor - - it's VERY black humor . Also the acting is right on target - - Scott is just great ( and Oscar nominated ) here . You see him trying to keep his sanity in a totally crazy situation . Riggs character is more than a little odd but her matter of fact manner works and she's also incredibly beautiful . The script is strong and brutal - - but never too much . I think it fumbles the ball at the end with a situation that goes way too over the top - - but it's still worth seeing . If this had been done totally seriously it probably would be impossible to take . Also look for Katherine Helmond in a small bit and Stockard Channing and Christopher Guest in uncredited bits . I personally had trouble taking this seriously . From what I've heard hospitals WERE this bad back in the 1970s but not anymore . See it for the acting and script . I give it a 7 .
477485	463200	49061	7.0	Depressing but good	Jane Hurley ( Debbie Reynolds ) , a poor girl , is marrying Ralph ( Rod Taylor ) . They don't want a big , elaborate wedding but her mother Agnes Hurley ( Bette Davis ) is determined to give it to her - - even if it drives her husband Tom ( Ernest Borgnine ) to bankruptcy . Purportedly this was made for TV but I have my doubts . Consider the talent - - it's based on a play by Paddy Chayefsky and adapted by Gore Vidal , and it has Borgnine , Davis and Barry Fitzgerald who were all movie actors . Also Reynolds and Taylor were rising stars in movies not TV . For whatever reason it was released theatrically . It's well-directed and has a very beautiful score which is used sparingly ( as it should be ) . But this is strong stuff . Seeing a likable if poor family being torn apart by a wedding is very upsetting . If they had used lesser actors this might have been easier to take but when you have Davis and Borgnine giving their all it's difficult to watch . Borgnine is just great - - you feel the man's anger and shame . Davis is fantastic too - - she gestures a little bit too much but it's still a powerful performance . And she fakes a very convincing Brooklyn accent . Reynolds isn't that good ( except for one scene in the kitchen when she explodes ) but she was just starting out . And Barry Fitzgerald had played the lovable Irish uncle once too often when he did this movie . But there's a great screenplay ( of course ) and it's shot appropriately in atmospheric black & white . My only big complaint is the ending . It ends on a happy note . On one hand , I liked it - - on the other hand , I didn't believe it for a minute . It was great to get a break from all the bleakness , but it rang so false that I couldn't swallow it . That aside though , this is well worth seeing . I'm giving it a 7 .
478218	463200	73812	8.0	Dated but lots of fun !	Tommy is very 1970s - - the clothes , the music , the drugs . . . but it's lots of fun . Also if you came of age in that era ( like me ) , it's very nostalgic . The movie is stunningly directed by Ken Russell - - the imagery is astounding and manages to complement the music . The music is , for the most part , good , but the Who obviously made changes for the movie - - and not very good ones . The acting is all good , especially Ann-Margret who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for this movie . I think she got nominated just for her sequence with the exploding TV ! Most of the singing is great ( Ann-Margret , Tina Turner , Elton John ) but there are a few who should never have been allowed to sing ( Oliver Reed , Jack Nicholson , Keith Moon - - he was a great drummer but no singer ! ) . My only complaint is it loses a lot on TV . I saw it in a movie theatre on a large screen and loud sound . It blew me away ! On TV , you don't get the same effect . Still , worth watching . If you get a chance to see it in a movie theatre , don't pass it up !
479466	463200	44009	8.0	Easy to see why this won the Oscar as Best Documentary of 1953	Adaptation of Rachel Carson's book about the sea . I've never read the book so I don't know how faithful it is but some of this is fascinating . It starts out pretty badly with ponderous narration describing how the Earth ( and sea ) came into being . After that it lightens up pretty quickly and shows us various creatures of the sea including some incredible microscopic views of sea life . There's an interesting ( and non-bloody ) fight between a shark and an octopus . It also shows various occupations men have dealing with the sea like a shark walker and crab herder . The part showing different ways to capture fish ( so they can be killed and eaten ) might be troubling to some viewers but it's more of a sign of the time it was made than anything else . Narration aside this should be seen for visuals alone . Also the ending seems to predict global warming before it was discovered ! I give it an 8 .
478781	463200	43924	8.0	Well-made but dated	Beautiful acting , good diretion help VERY dated story of a poor man ( Montgomery Clift ) falling in love with a rich woman ( Liz Taylor ) after getting another poor woman ( Shelley Winters ) pregnant . All the examinations of class and rich vs . poor are obvious and very 1940s . The acting helps a lot - - Clift is pretty good in the title role , but sometimes he seems too mannered in his portrayal . . . he should have shown more depth in his performance . Winters is excellent in her role , but she is annoying ( she's supposed to be ) and overly pathetic at times . Taylor is drop-dead gorgeous and very good in her role . She's a bit too goody-goody , but you never once disbelieve that she loves Clift . Worth seeing .
477237	463200	47688	8.0	Glossy but entertaining	Musical drama / soap opera about three sisters ( Doris Day , Dorothy Malone , Elizabeth Fraser ) and the men they fall in love woth - - film concentrates on Day and her romances with Gig Young and Frank Sinatra . Film takes place in a picture perfect world - - everybody lives in big beautiful houses ; everything is squeaky clean and full of color ; everybody looks perfect - - typical 1950s Hollywood . The story is interesting and ( with one exception ) the acting is good although Malone and Ethel Barrymore look miserable and are totally wasted . However , Gig Young is exceptional as the man in love with Day - - he kick starts the movie whenever he's on screen . Day grins ( and grins and grins and grins and grins . . . ) . Day and Sinatra sing all the songs ( separately ) and when they sing the movie becomes magical - - they were both at their peaks here . There's only two problems with the picture - - 1 ) the ending is totally unrealistic and comes out of nowhere and 2 ) Sinatra . He was a great singer but no actor . His character comes off as childish , obnoxious and depressing - - I couldn't believe Day falling for him . He doesn't destry the picture , just lessens it . All in all , it's colorful and entertaining with a superb performance by Young . Worth seeing .
479095	463200	95599	8.0	Very good mystery / thriller	Young handsome Tim Whalen ( Rob Lowe ) falls in love with filthy rich Olivia Lawrence ( Meg Tilly ) . But does he love her or just her money ? There's also his jilted ex lover ( Kim Cattrall ) , her lecherous stepfather ( John Glover ) , HIS mistress ( Dana Delany ) and police officer Mike McGill ( Doug Savant ) . I saw this originally back in 1988 and loved it . Seeing it again all these years later I STILL love it . As you can see this has an incredible cast of people before they hit it big . They're all great too - - especially Savant . Also it gives the audience what it wants pretty quick - - both Lowe and Cattrall have nude scenes within the first 10 minutes ! The story has many twists and turns and always keeps the viewer guessing . It was beautifully filmed and directed in the Hamptons and has a lush music score . SPOILERS ! ! ! There are also two scenes between Lowe and Savant that have STRONG homoerotic vibes . In one Savant is in a pair of VERY tight white underwear . I swear at one point I thought they were gonna kiss ! It adds an interesting subtext to the film . END SPOILER ! ! ! ! With the exception of Tilly all the acting is good . Even Lowe pulls off a difficult role . Beautifully done , intricate mystery . Well worth seeing .
479064	463200	38988	8.0	Very good film noir	As a young girl Martha Ivers accidentally kills her evil grandmother . She and a boy friend of hers cover it up and accuse an innocent man of it . Years later they're all grown up and played by Barbara Stanwyck and Kirk Douglas ( his film debut ) . They're married and miserable but have their lie keeping them together . Then a man ( Van Heflin ) Martha loved very much as a girl accidentally crashes his car in the town . He has no interest in Martha but is in love with someone else ( Lizabeth Scott ) . . . but Martha won't let him go . Well-done film noir . The dialogue is great ( especially the exchanges between Heflin and Scott ) , it looks beautiful and the acting is mostly well-done . Heflin is just OK - - but it fits his role ; Stanwyck is very good but not given much to do ( she doesn't appear until 30 minutes in ! ) and Douglas is TERRIBLE . . . but this WAS his first film . Scott is , surprisingly , the best . A very good , credible performance . I couldn't take my eyes off her when she was on screen . She easily outacted everybody else . I can only give this an 8 though for 2 reasons : Kirks ' lousy acting and the movie goes on way too long - - at least 20 minutes could have been cut . Still , worth catching . Some consider this Stanwycks ' best film ( I disagree ) .
477228	463200	126029	8.0	Finally ! A good 2001 movie !	This has been a horrible year for movies so far - - no doubt about it . From horrendous comedies to lousy horror films to boring art fims it's been a sad year . Finally , though , a really good film has come along . " Shrek " is a computer animated comedy for all ages . It's one of those rare films that adults and children can enjoy . Shrek ( voiced by Mike Myers with a Scottish accent ) , is a large green-skinned ogre who goes to save a princess ( Cameron Diaz ) from a fiery dragon . Why ? Because evil Lord Farquaad ( John Lithgow ) is destroying his property but will spare it if he saves the princess . An abrasive donkey ( Eddie Murphy ) comes along to help . Murphy gets a little too loud and abrasive and the movie does have its dull stretches , but mostly the jokes are flying fast and furious , the animation is flawless and occasionally beautiful , and the whole thing has a happy ending . There's also a few hilarious pot shots at Disney . Go , see it and enjoy ! Well worth 10 bucks .
477579	463200	39391	8.0	Long but entertaining	Story takes place in 1660 England . Strang willed 16 year old Amber St . Clair ( Linda Darnell ) falls in love with bland Bruce Carlton ( Cornel Wilde ) . She follows him to England but he doesn't love her . So Amber decides to become rich and powerful no matter what . The book this was based on was a HUGE bestseller in the 1940s . It was ( for its time ) a racy book that makes it clear that Amber sleeps her way to the top . Also the book was historically accurate and ( even at 800 + pages ) a fascinating read . 20th Century Fox took the book , jettisoned all the racy stuff ( more or less ) and spent great care and no expense in bringing this to the screen . It's in beautiful color with gorgeous costumes and sets . Sure , there are plot holes and bad acting but this is never dull and speeds along . Even at 140 minutes it didn't seem too long . Darnell is beautiful and pretty good in the lead . George Sanders matches her playing Charles II . He's clearly enjoying himself . Richard Greene is good also popping up as a friend of Ambers . However Wilde is pretty bad as Carlton - - you keep wondering what Amber sees in him . The silly wig he wears doesn't do him any favors . It's kind of funny to realize this was considered pretty dirty back in 1947 . It wouldn't raise an eyebrow today and , as it is , the movie never makes it clear that Amber is sleeping around . So it's colorful , elaborate and well worth catching . The book was better but this is easier than reading it ! An 8 .
477173	463200	105275	8.0	Violent and brutal	A gang of skinheads in Melbourne Australia hate Asians and attack them every chance they get . They realize their neighborhood is being " taken over " by Asians and go on a rampage . The gang leader is Hondo ( Russell Crowe ) who picks up Gaby ( Jacqueline McKenzie ) . However she soon tires of his violent attitude and falls for his best friend Davey ( Daniel Pollock ) . It all comes to a tragic end . This film is far from perfect . The movie jumps around and the story is somewhat vague . Still it's well-directed with some very brutal violent fights and one fairly explicit sex scene . The movie doesn't take sides either . It does concentrate on the skinheads and Gaby , Davey and some of the women are shown as sympathetic characters but the rest are shown as sick , violent sociopaths . This originally got an NC-17 from the MPAA . From what I read , this was given that only because the MPAA thought if they gave it an R rating they would be accused of promoting racism ( which is just silly ) . It now has an R and ( from what I can see ) there's no cuts from the NC-17 version . Pollock ( who sadly committed suicide before this was released ) and McKenzie are very good in their roles and the others are too . Only Crowe is just OK . A very violent brutal film . Not for everyone , but it is a strong angry statement about racism and how it can destroy and kill . I give it an 8 .
477362	463200	30287	8.0	Wonderfully directed , superbly acted by Davis and Bainter	Bette Davis is at her best in this 1800s Southern melodrama in which her attempts to snag a married ex-love ( Henry Fonda ) end in tragedy . Storywise this is nothing new , and there are way too many scenes were people talk endlessly about Southern manners . Also seeing all the black slaves so happy and singing is a bit hard to take . But the direction by William Wyler is excellent . He directs in a way that makes you part of the action ( especially in the ball sequence and a duel at the end ) . Best of all is Davis . Her performance is superb - - when she's on screen you can't take your eyes off her . She won a well-deserved Best Actress Oscar for this . Also Fay Bainter is excellent as her long-suffering aunt - - she won Best Supporting Actress . All the acting is good except for Henry Fonda - - he's so stiff and dull - - what does Davis want with him ? One last complaint - - it's not in color . I know there are two reasons for this : 1 ) the expense and 2 ) they did tests and Davis looked horrible in color ( think about it - - how many color movies did she make ? ) . Still , the non-stop compliments about the red dress at the beginning are annoying - - the dress looks black ! Still , this is worth seeing for Davis , Bainter and the direction .
478995	463200	39286	8.0	Powerful , well-made but a little overstated	A bigoted soldier kills a man for being Jewish and tries to pin it on a fellow soldier . Not as good as the novel it was based on ( " The Brick Foxhole " ) in which it was a gay man who was killed . . . but Hollywood wouldn't touch that in 1947 . That said , it's still a very good film . The anti-Semitism is handled very well , but it's hammered into the audience that bigotry is bad . . . well duh ! But this was 1947 . The picture is well-acted by the entire cast ( especially Robert Young and Robert Ryan ) and the tone is very dark . . . as it should be . Very atmospheric too . A deserved big hit in its day . . . well worth seeing .
477539	463200	180093	8.0	Brilliant but very disturbing	A chronicle of four people ( Jared Leto , Marlon Wayans , Jennifer Connolly and Ellen Burstyn ) and their drug addictions and what it does to their lives . Starts off OK but becomes darker and more disturbing as it goes along . It ends with a montage showing what happens to all four of them - - this sequence contains some of the most harrowing imagery I've ever seen in a film . Honestly , I don't think I'll ever see it again - - it's that graphic ! Still , see the film . Leto is OK ; Wayans is ( surprisingly ) pretty good ; Connolly is excellent - - I've never liked her until now ; and Burstyn is simply superb - - a sure Oscar winner if I ever saw one . Well , worth seeing but very disturbing . Unfortunately , this film has an NC-17 rating . That's too bad - - it should have an R rating so high school kids could see it . This would turn them off drugs for good !
479169	463200	100768	8.0	Very good documentary	William Greaves hosts this fascinating documentary about the underground black film made from the 1920s to the 1950s . Black people saw they were being portrayed negatively in Hollywood films so they went out to make their own films that showed them as they really were . These were made only to be shown in all-black cinemas ( cinemas were segregated back then ) . Most of these films are gone forever but this shows clips from a number that are still around . The movies spoke out against racism and the terrible conditions that black ghettos were in but - - other than that - - they were like any other Hollywood film . This film showed me some things I never knew like : How some Hollywood studios used white actors in black face to play black people because they didn't think black people could act ! Bing Crosby is shown in one ! Black actors had to go to Europe to get roles . Paul Robeson went to England to make movies - - - and he STILL found himself cast as a slave ! Horribly negative stereotypes where shown in cartoons . Lena Horne , Ethel Waters , Nat King Cole , Cab Calloway all got their start in black independent films . Even Sammy Davis Jr . shown here at the age of 8 in his first film . Very good and short ( about 1 hour ) docu on a subject most people are unaware of . Worth catching .
477856	463200	22276	8.0	Fast-paced and racy	Poor factory girl ( Joan Crawford ) goes to New York to find fame and fortune . She quickly becomes a " kept " woman for a rich lawyer ( Clark Gable - - without his moustache ) . But she can't keep her past away forever and things start to go terribly wrong . Strong ( for 1931 ) , short ( 71 minutes ) pre-Code drama . The script is sharp and believable , the direction good and there are some incredibly lavish settings . Also Crawford and Gable are just great in their roles and both of them look incredibly beautiful . There was a brief part at the end that I didn't buy , but that didn't destroy the picture at all . Well worth seeing for anybody , but a definite must for Crawford and Gable fans .
477729	463200	408666	8.0	Very well-done original vampire movie	A man comes home for his birthday party after work . However it seems he has been " infected " by vampire's and intends to " pass it " on to his family . A gang of black youths get involved and it all ends up with humans vs . vampires . Interesting take on vampire's that shows it as a disease and one that works FAST . When people get a taste of tainted blood they immediately become vampires . These vampires have huge fangs , piercing eyes ( neat makeup job ) , move FAST and tell plenty of bad jokes ( we got " Nightmare on Elm Street " to thank for that ) . The movie is by no means great . It was direct to video and it shows . The film is very grainy with bad sound too . Also they throw in a lesbian couple for no reason other than to show gratuitous female nudity . ( I'd LOVE to see a gay male couple in one of these films ) . The film does have a mix or black and white characters - - but they're all stereotypes . The family is heavily dysfunctional and all the black guys and woman are in gangs , swear constantly and always travel with guns . Still this film works . It IS scary and has tons of blood and gore ( I can't see how this got by with an R rating ) . There's also a very eerie atmosphere with plenty of shock cuts to keep you off balance . The acting is OK - - nobody is really good but nobody is really bad either . Basically they all do well in their roles . Interesting ending too . This is no masterpiece of horror but I found it interesting and well-done ( on its budget ) . I give it an 8 .
479112	463200	210616	8.0	Cliché city , but I LOVED it !	Let's see - - you've got a bunch of young hopefuls in a tough ballet school in NYyou have the tough , but lovable , black girl ; the token gay man ; the sweet virginal heroine ; the arrogant Russian guy ; the sweet lovable guy who's perfect for the sweet heroine , but she doesn't know it ; the b who's starving herself to death ; the guy who loves her and wants to help her ; the tyrannical ( but lovable ) ballet teachers - - yep , they're all here ! The script is utterly predictable , you know how it's going to end 10 minutes into the movie , but I loved it ! The acting is surprisingly good , it's beautifully filmed , the whole cast is attractive and the dancing is simply superb . I wasn't bored once during the entire 2 hours . Well worth seeing .
479353	463200	102370	8.0	Great documentary	Documentary of Madonna's 1990 " Blonde Ambition " tour . Madonna had total control over this film so most of it was manipulated by her and she probably left off some of the really damaging material . Still , there are more than a few unguarded moments in the film with Madonna and her crew talking , fighting , complaining that can't be staged . Also there are a few hilarious moments with her then-boyfriend Warren Beatty . The documentary , backstage stuff is in grainy black and white ( with lousy sound ) and the concert scenes are in bright color , great sound and ( sadly ) MTV style editing . Still , it's fun , entertaining , very dirty ( but this IS Madonna ) and a hilarious game of truth or dare played with her and the crew . Low points : Director Alex Keshishain strangely has fairly extensive interview footage with the only straight male dancer in the group - - Oliver Crumes . Crumes comes across an as obnoxious , homophobic and sexist jerk . He's actually surprised that all the other male dancers are gay ! What planet did he grow up on ? Also his dancing ( what you see of it ) is pretty lousy . And the portrayal of the gay dancers is not exactly positive . The film is too long ( it could lose 20 minutes ) and not all the songs are good . Still , worth seeing . One BIG complaint - - the video version has two extra added numbers - - " Hanky Panky " and a Dick Tracy number - - they're not on the DVD . Why not ?
478679	463200	64064	8.0	No classic but funny	I had heard about this for years but thought it was just a silly joke . Really - - " Bambi Meets Godzilla " . . . come on ! To my total surprise it played one night years later as part of an animation festival . I admit the credits were amusing and I broke out laughing at the end . . . but that was about it . The animation is terrible and , after seeing it once , it doesn't play well again at all . I think it gets all this attention just because of the title . So , worth catching once but it's just a one-joke film . That's all I have to really say but IMDb requires 10 lines of text for everything . That's kind of silly . I mean foe feature films it makes sense but for a 2 minute short ? ? ? ? ? How much can you say ? It's taking me more time to type this than it takes to watch this short . THERE ! I completed over 10 lines : )
477858	463200	51554	8.0	OK - - I'm giving it an 8 BUT . . .	I can't really say I enjoy this movie . It's not terrible but I find a lot of it very slow and dull and it doesn't scare me at all . Still , it IS a horror classic . This is where Christopher Lee first played Dracula and Peter Cushing became van Helsing . It's very handsomely produced with bright vivid colors . The settings are just beautiful and there's a loud , pounding score driving the film . Cushing and Lee are just perfect in their roles . Lee is tall , handsome and sexually attractive . . . but is downright scary when he's hungry . The scene where we first see him with blood on his face and the red glaring eyes STILL makes me jump . Cushing is just great as the good doctor - - he made that role his . Everybody else isn't really that good . Michael Gough , a very good actor , is surprisingly terrible ! This film was critized a lot when it came out for the amount of violence . In Britain there were actual cases of people fainting in the theatres ! By today's standards this is pretty tame stuff - - PG rating all the way . The only scene that is still cut from most TV prints is the staking of Lucy ( it's not that bad ) . So , I acknowledge that this is a classic and that Lee and Cushing were born to play these roles . I just find the movie sort of slow .
478648	463200	82533	8.0	An almost classic	TV newswoman Karen White ( Dee Wallace ) is traumatized by a meeting with a psycho killer in a porno shop . A pompous doctor , George Waggner ( Patrick Macnee ! ) , invites her to " The Colony " - - a woodland clinic of his to help her get over the shock . Karen and her husband Bill ( Christopher Stone ) go . . . unaware that there are wolves roaming around . . . This is a full throttle horror-comedy with an emphasis on the comedy . It's almost as good as " American Werewolf in London " . It's fun , has sharp dialogue and constant wolf references ( a copy of the book " Howl " is seen on a desk ; people watch " The Big Bad Wolf " and " The Wolf Man " on TV ) . Also The Colony itself is just gorgeous and beautifully atmospheric . In the day it's clear and bright - - at night the fog rolls in and it becomes really creepy . Also it playfully injects horror clichés in the movie ( I got a big kick out of the sequence in which Karen and a friend get lost in the woods , their flashlight goes out and there's howling in the distance . . . ) . It's ALMOST a classic . The problems are many , but the main one is that the film isn't scary - - when you see the werewolves they look pretty pathetic . This is supposed to be ( partially ) a HORROR film - - it doesn't help when the main monsters look silly . The transformation scenes look lousy too - - but this was over 20 years ago . The story is sort of vague ( why does Dr . Waggner invite her to the colony in the first place ? It puts her in danger ! ) and there are plenty of dead spots . It seems too long and it's only 90 minutes ! Also Wallace and Stone are not good actors - - Wallace's reaction to finding a dead , bloody body is very poor and Stone sleepwalks through his role ( although he does very well at a campfire sequence - - you'll know it when you see it ) . So , it has great atmosphere , some very good laughs , John Carradine and some very good cameos ( Dick Miller , Roger Corman and Forrest J . Ackerman holding a copy of his magazine " Famous Monsters of Filmland " ) but it's VERY light and insubstantial - - you want to see a real movie after this . Nevertheless , it's worth seeing but not the classic it could have been .
478116	463200	82894	8.0	Not enjoyable but fascinating	This takes place in 1934 Chicago . Sheet music salesman Arthur Parker ( Steve Martin ) hates his job and is married to a frigid unloving wife ( Jessica Harper ) . He then meets naive unmarried Eileen ( Bernadette Peters ) . Sex , rape , abortion , prostitution and murder follow . This is all pretty grim but , without warning , all the characters start lip syncing to cheerful songs from that era and musical numbers start . These numbers are very impressive and would make Busby Berkeley turn green with envy . This was ( for 1981 ) a very odd idea for a big budget Hollywood movie . A bleak , depressing storyline full of unlikable characters is undercut by the cheerful music and dancing . This was released around Christmas as a holiday movie ( a VERY bad idea ) and was savaged by the critics and ignored by audiences . If this had been released at any other time of the year it might have been successful . Also this was years ahead of its time . I saw it twice when it came out . I was thoroughly depressed after each screening but fascinated too . There was nothing else like this at the time . The set design was VERY impressive . Some shots are recreations of famous paintings of that time-I recognized " Nighthawks " right away ! The songs were great and they used the original recordings . They didn't transfer the songs to stereo either - - they wanted them to sound like they did back then . The dances are just downright astounding . They're among some of the best I've ever seen . Christopher Walken stops the show by lip syncing ( and tap dancing ) to " Let's Misbehave " . Casting Martin and Peters in this was a mistake . At this point neither were known for doing drama - - Martin was a comedian and Peters just sang . Martin does OK in his role but Peters is pretty bad in hers . It doesn't destroy the movie it just lessens the impact . Harper is very good ( although she's not in the movie much ) . So it's a depressing but a one of a kind movie . I give it an 8 .
477949	463200	66740	8.0	Strange horror movie	Doctors are being killed in various gruesome ways in 1925 London . They only have one thing in common - - they all worked on an operation to save Victoria Phibes - - but she died . Her husband Anton ( Vincent Price ) supposedly died in a car crash . It seems he survived , blames all the doctors for his wives death and sets out to kill them using the curses visited on the pharaohs before Exodus in the Bible ! Phibes has a helper named Vulnevia ( Virginia North ) and , occasionally , dances with her in front of a robot band while old music plays . As you can see this is one odd horror film . Still it's ALMOST great . The deaths are imaginative , bloody and pretty funny ( this wouldn't get a PG rating today ) . The sets are beautiful - - especially Phibes ' Art Deco place and the all green hospital . The film also has plenty of comedy which is ( for once ) actually funny . But the musical interludes don't work for me . They stop the film dead and add nothing to the plot . It seems they were just added to pad out the running time . Still , we get to see beautiful Virginia North in some eye-popping costumes and hear some great old music - - but that's not what I look for in horror films . The acting is good too - - Price can't move a muscle in his face but still manages to overact ( amusingly ) with his voice ; Peter Jeffrey is LOTS of fun as Inspector Trout ; Joseph Cotton gives a very good performance as one of the doctors and North doesn't have a word of dialogue but looks stunning and plays her part completely straight-faced . Also Caroline Munro pops up ( in pictures ) as Victoria Phibes . Some people have complained that this is a bit too gruesome for kids . Well . . . I saw it at a drive-in when I was 9 and it didn't bother me ! The only part that scared me was when Price took off his mask and revealed his face . I distinctly remember hiding behind the car seat when that came on ! I can only give this an 8 though because the movie , logically , doesn't make a bit of sense ! Most of the murders could never happen and I still can't figure out how Phibes faked his death , got rescued , bought the house and make the ( very ) elaborate sets . And who the heck is Vulnavia ? Still it is enjoyable and has a great ending which uses " Over the Rainbow " to great effect . Even some of my friends who hate horror films like this one ! Worth catching . Just ignore logic . And stay tuned after the closing credits for a neat little surprise !
479088	463200	101694	8.0	Goldie tries a thriller	Dark , somber thriller about an art restorer Adrienne ( Goldie Hawn ) meeting Jack Saunders ( John Heard ) and falling in love . They marry , have a kid and are happy - - until 6 years ( or so ) into the marriage he's suddenly killed . Slowly Adrienne discovers her husband wasn't who she thought he was . . . Sort of a film noir . Hawn decided to take a chance on a dramatic role . Unfortunately this film fizzled at the box office and Hawn herself later said she made a mistake . I actually like the film . I liked it in 1991 and I still like it now 15 years later . It's got an intricate plot and some very nice directorial touches ( some of the scenes were beautiful ) . Love their apartment too . There was also a very unusual but effective music score and a few nice jolts in the movie too . The acting varies . Heard is VERY good is his role . Unfortunately Hawn isn't in hers . She's somber , quiet and too restrained . She seems very uncomfortable in the role . She doesn't ruin the movie but she lessens the impact - - maybe it's a good thing that she never tried this again . Also I noticed quite a few plot loopholes left dangling after the movie was over . Still I found this engrossing and well-made . Worth catching . I give it an 8 .
477232	463200	51755	8.0	Neat little thriller	Eerie little film about a cemetery caretaker ( Richard Boone ) who finds he can cause the deaths of people by changing their white pins in a cemetery map into black pins . . . or can he ? Sounds silly and the film definetely has it's dull stretches ( even at 75 minutes ) , but it works . The whole cast plays it straight , which helps , and there's also a very spooky music score . Also some views of the map were pretty spooky . I felt the ending cheated a little , but it worked . Good compact thriller - - not a horror film . Recommended .
479067	463200	74554	9.0	Not funny but a great movie	Fictionalized look about the 1950s blacklist . Woody Allen ( in a rare dramatic role ) plays a man who sells the scripts of blacklisted writers under his name . He splits the proceeds with the writers . He's apolitical - - he's just doing it to help friends . Then he starts to see how horrible the blacklist is and how it's destroying people and careers . He wants to take a stand - - but how can he ? This is often mentioned as being a comedy . In that respect , it fails . There was nothing funny about the blacklist . But , as a drama with light moments , it works . It moves quickly , is well written ( by a former blacklisted writer ) , well-directed ( by another blacklisted man ) and stars two blacklisted actors ! Basically these people know what happened so that actually helps . Allen is surprisingly good in a dramatic role - - who knew he had it in him ? He tones down all his mannerisms and delivers a very controlled , nicely done job . Andrea Marcovicci ( whatever happened to her ? ) is also good playing his girlfriend . And Michael Murphy is excellent as one of the blacklisted writers . And Zero Mostel is just superb as a blacklisted actor . The pain and confusion shows plainly on his face . This was also one of his last films - - - he died 2 years later of a heart attack . Also look for Danny Aiello in a small role . The 1950s era is captured beautifully , the film looks great and they have Frank Sinatra singing ( ironically ) " Young at Heart " at the beginning and end of the film . Great final line too . But I'm only giving this a 9 . The script is good but a little too simplistic and painted in very broad strokes . The bad guys are evil to the core and all the blacklisted people are shown as being victims . That's NOT how it was . They were probably writing down to appeal to a mainstream audience but went too far . This bombed badly back in 1976 - - it's easy to see why . The subject matter is too strong for most audiences and the movie company ( I heard ) was completely at a loss on how to deal with this . Just a year before an entire blacklisting sequence was cut from " The Way We Were " . Sadly Hollywood was STILL touchy about this subject in the 1970s . This should be seen by more people - - it really deserves to be discovered . A lot of people don't even KNOW about the blacklist . Well worth seeing .
477647	463200	55597	9.0	Landmark of gay cinema . . . and a good drama too	Film takes place in Britain in 1961 . Back then you could be sent to jail if you were found to be a homosexual . A happily married successful barrister ( Dirk Bogarde ) is being blackmailed by a brief affair he had with another man years before . He doesn't want to pay . . . but if he doesn't his career and marriage will be over . What can he do ? When this came on TV originally all the scenes with dialogue about gays were cut out ( ! ! ! ! ) cutting the film by 10 minutes and making it incomprehensible . It wasn't until 1990 that complete versions started showing up and people realized how good this film really was . There's nothing explicit in it but the dialogue ( heard today ) comes across as incredibly homophobic and ignorant . Also homosexuality is presented as a disease that can be cured ! Still , for its time , that's how it was thought of and some of the characters make it clear that gays are just like anybody else . It tries to show both sides of the issue . The film is tight and quick - - it moves very quickly . It's shot in moody black & white which helps the atmosphere of the film . The writing is good and the acting is just great - - there's not one bad performance in this . The two leads are incredible - - Dirk Bogarde is just great as the barrister whose life is slowly becoming a living hell . You see him fighting to keep control . Even better is Sylvia Syms as his wife who struggles to understand what is happening . The sequence between the two of them when he tells her what happened is just great . Ironically star Bogarde was gay in real life - - but never came out even though he lived until 1999 . It's sad that decades after this film was made , gay people are still afraid to come out . As a film this is no ground breaker - - just a quick , very good thriller . For gay representation it's a milestone . It was the first time the word " homosexual " was used in a film ( I believe ) and showed compassion for its gay characters . A must for viewers of gay cinema and anyone who likes a well-done thriller . A 9 .
479109	463200	120910	9.0	Not as good as the original but fun	First off , I could have lived without the little intros from an all-star cast ( Steve Martin , Bette Midler , James Earl Jones , Penn & Teller , Angela Landsbury , etc . ) and the movie was way too short ( 75 minutes ) . Still , the music was great ( of course ) and the animation fit the music perfectly . My favorites were the Tin Soldier one , the flamingo with the yo-yo and Donald Duck helping Noah get the animals on the ark . They stuck to classical music too . I heard they were considering using MODERN rock ' n'roll ! ! ! Thankfully that was no carried out . ( I can just picture animated figures dancing to " Like A Virgin " - - shudder ) . Not really for kids - - they'd be bored silly . But fun and entertaining for adults . Worth seeing - - couldn't it have just been a little longer ?
477838	463200	73778	10.0	Excellent drive-in trash	Film focuses on two gangs - - the Silver Daggers lead by Dominic ( Asher Brauner ) and the Dagger Debs lead by Dominic's girlfriend , Lace ( Robbie Lee ) . A new girl in town Maggie ( Joanne Nail ) joins the Debs and becomes friends with Lace - - but Dominic wants Maggie . Evil Deb Patch ( Monica Gayle ) knows this and manipulates Lace into hating Maggie . Also there's a rival gang , the Crabs , who are trying to take over . Silly but very engaging trash movie - - it's really an excellent movie OF ITS TYPE ! There's prison fights , lesbian guards , rape , prostitution , feminism , politics , a black female gang and tons of violence and action . There's also a hilarious ( and exciting ) shoot out at a skating rink ! There was a twist halfway through the movie that I didn't see coming and it all ends up with a climatic switchblade fight . I can honestly say I was never bored and enjoyed this thoroughly . The script is terrible but it never takes itself too seriously . As for the acting - - Brauner is OK as Dom ; Nail is lousy as Maggie and Lee is TERRIBLE as Lace - - easily one of the worst acting jobs I've ever seen in a movie ( and that's saying something ) . Gayle was actually pretty good as Patch . Also of note is Kitty Bruce ( Lenny Bruce's daughter ) who's character ( Donut ) is treated like dirt . The is NOT a good movie but an excellent trash film . Next to " Coffy " and " Foxy Brown " probably director / writer Jack Hill's best film . . . although he DOES call this a piece of trash . He's right !
477927	463200	91630	10.0	A rarity - - a horror comedy that is funny AND scary !	It all starts out with a beautiful black & white prologue at Corman ( nudge nudge ) University in 1959 . Some " creeps " ( disgusting little things ) come to Earth and attack a young man ( they get in through your mouth , turn you into a zombie and plant other " creepers " that shot out of the mouth to infect people ) . He is caught and frozen solid and ( for some reason ) kept at the university . Then , in 1986 , two friends Chris Romero ( nudge , nudge ) ( Jason Lively ) and J . C . ( Steve Marshall ) unwittingly revive him . He wakes up and attacks the university . Soon , it's overrun by the things - - it's up Chris , J . C . , Cynthia Cronenberg ( nudge nudge ) and Detective Cameron ( nudge nudge ) to battle them . As you can see this movie doesn't take itself seriously for one moment . Heck , there's even a cameo from Dick Miller ! And it IS very funny ( especially some of J . C . ' s lines ) . But it doesn't shy away from blood and gore - - there's PLENTY of that . And it is creepy ( sorry ) more than once . They even break one of the rules of horror films - - POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAa sympathetic character ( I won't say who ) dies and it's actually one of the film's more unpleasant moments ( you don't see it but you HEAR it ) . As 83 minutes it doesn't overstay it's welcome and ends with an all out massacre ( I'm REALLY surprised - - and pleased - - that this got an R rating ) . There are some gaps in the plot ( things happen way too quickly and characters just automatically correctly guess what's going on ) but this is a small quibble . I saw this back on video in 1986 after Fangoria magazine raved about it . I loved it - - then it disappeared . I never even saw it again until today ! Here's another great movie awaiting rediscovery . From what I heard Sony owns the rights - - hopefully we'll see the DVD someday . A fun , scary , gory movie . A 10 all the way ! " The good news is that your dates are here . The bad news is they're dead ! "
478981	463200	30442	10.0	Great forgotten comedy	Rich , scatterbrained Emily Kilbourne ( Billie Burke ) has the habit of bringing in down-on-their-luck , homeless men to help them much to the disgust of her husband and children . They usually rob her blind and leave . Then Wade Rawlins ( Brian Aherne ) who just LOOKS down and out enters her life and she invites him in and he starts to change the whole family . . . for the better . The plot IS predictable but this is still a very funny screwball comedy . The script is great with one liners flying fast and furious . The entire cast is up for it - - Burke is just great and received an Oscar nomination for her performance ; Aherne is just OK ; Constance Bennett is wonderful as Jerry who falls for Rawlins and Alan Mowbray has some very funny sequences as the family butler . Catchy title tune too ( also nominated for an Oscar ) . The romance between Bennett is Aherne is a bit too predictable and there's a very rushed ending . Also an offensive black stereotype is thrown in at the end . Still this is a fast , funny , wonderful film that deserves to be better known . Recommended . Good luck finding a good print - - the only one available is in terrible condition .
479544	463200	303797	10.0	Just great	Fascinating documentary with the actors and actresses of Broadway's " Golden Age " ( late 1940s-late 1960s ) talking about their experiences on stage , who influenced them , how they got into the business etc etc . What's truly incredible is when they compare and contrast how Broadway was back then and how it is now . They were a close-knit family back then ; they didn't need mikes to project their voices throughout the theatre ; the incredibly low ticket prices back then as compared to now . . . The picture isn't perfect . . . it's not done chronologically and there's no historical or sociological perspective . Still there's rare live footage of some of the Broadway shows and all the stories are just incredible . It makes one feel sad to realize we'll never see a world like that again . Everybody is good but Elaine Stritch is an absolute howl ! A must see for all Broadway fans . A 10 all the way .
478427	463200	39192	10.0	A one of a kind	Nuns led by Sister Clodagh ( Deborah Kerr ) attempt to establish a hospital and school in the Himalayas . They find themselves having to deal with physical , emotional and sexual hardships . The story here is secondary - - this film is one of the most stunning color films ever made ( try to see a good color print ) . It contains breathtaking visuals , great direction ( particularly fine use of color , light and shadow ) and great performances all around . The only fault I had was with the two main male characters played by Sabu and David Farrar - - they were both annoying ( especially Farrar ) and ( in the case of Sabu ) not really necessary to the plot . However , that's a small complaint . This is a must see film . Best acting comes from Kerr and Kathleen Byron ( especially at the end ) .
478349	463200	35753	10.0	Depressing and disturbing but just great	This takes place in a small French town in 1943 . Someone called " The Raven " is sending poison pen letters to various people in the town . They're filled with half-truths or outright lies but it begins to affect people . Quickly the whole town falls apart - - relationships are destroyed , mistrust and suspicion are all over and it finally leads to suicide and a murder . Plotwise this may seem familiar to many but it's beautifully done . The film moves quickly , is well-acted and director Henri-Georges Clourot ( who also directed the classic " Diabolique " ) does a wonderful job of visualizing the paranoia and hatred of the townspeople . The best sequence has a nurse running away when she thinks she is being chased by a crowd . Also this deals with sex outside marriage , pregnancy and abortion - - taboo subject in 1943 . Believe it or not this was seen as Nazi propaganda in its day ! It was shot while France was being occupied and shows a town full of violent , suspicious and angry people . French people thought it was a slap in the face to them - - showing them as ignorant people who let lies destroy them . That seems pretty silly now . It's now rightfully regarded as a classic . Well worth catching . I give it a 10 .
479345	463200	109508	10.0	Fascinating if unsettling	Absorbing profile of Robert Crumb , an underground cartoonist . Shows him at work and interacting with his friends and heavily dysfunctional family . I had no idea who Robert Crumb was ( all I knew was that he created " Fritz the Cat " ) and I find underground comics repulsive but I was never bored or repelled by this movie . It has him talking about his life and his work along with interviews with his family and friends also discussing him and his work . The film shows many of Crumb's graphic work ( VERY graphic for an R rated movie ) and has him discussing , analyzing and ( at times ) defending his work . We also see oppossing or agreement from other art critics or artists . What's most interesting is that we see he came from a very destructive family and puts all of his hatred and childhood misery into his drawings . I still don't like underground comics , but this movie helped me understand them . . . to a degree . Also a haunting look at a disturbed family . . . but it's treated sort of lightly . . . not dark and heavy . Very interesting and well done . Not for everyone but great for those with VERY open minds .
477855	463200	47296	10.0	Quite simply a classic	Gripping , powerful drama of corrupt unions for dock workers and how one man Terry Malloy ( Marlon Brando ) fights back . This movie is a definite must-see . The story is pretty simple and has been done before but the script is superb and all the actors are at the height of their powers . Brando is unbelievable as Malloy - - he portrays his innocence and hurt so easily - - I actually started to get a lump in my throat when he comes to grips about the corruption . Rod Steiger is great in a small role as his brother . The taxicab sequence between him and Brando has become a legend - - rightfully . Lee J . Cobb is frightening as the leader of it all . Eva Marie Saint ( in her first theatrical role ) is gorgeous and just great as a woman who falls in love with Brando . The scenes between them are incredible . There's also superb direction by Elia Kazan - - this is possibly his best work . The only debit here is Karl Malden as the priest - - he overplays it way too much and got on more nerves . But that's about it . This movie is one of those rare instances where everything clicked together perfectly . A HUGE hit in its day . Don't miss this one !
478450	463200	74285	10.0	One of DePalma's best	High school misfit Carrie ( Sissy Spacek ) unleashes her telekinetic fury on her tormentors . This was a huge hit in 1976 and scared me silly . It doesn't scare me now ( except for the closing sequence ) , but I still think it's a good solid horror film beautifully handled by Brian De Palma . It moves quickly , has some beautiful imagery ( everything is shot soft focus with muted color ) and has almost uniformally good performances . The only bad one is by John Travolta way out of his depth playing a hood . Amy Irving ( as a student who befriends Carrie ) , William Katt ( with a very 70s afro ) , Nancy Allen ( playing a real bitch ) , Betty Buckley ( so young and full of energy ) and P . J . Soles ( silly but bearable ) are all perfect . But Spacek is superb matched by Piper Laurie who is very scary and marvelous as her deranged , religious mother . They were both nominated for Best Supporting Actresses Awards ( very unusual for a horror film ) . Also the film is ( by today's standards ) very restrained in terms of blood and gore . And the final sequence will make you jump ( also notice the cars in the background during that - - they're moving backwards ! ) Only complaints - - De Palma REALLY hates some of the high school kids - - you feel like like he's working out some personal issues here . And did we really need the slow-mo shower sequence at the beginning ? That aside - - this is a great film . See it letter boxed .
477790	463200	179624	10.0	Just great ! ! ! ! !	This was put together in 1994 to celebrate the first 100 years of the movies . It starts with the silents and moves all the way up to 1994 ending with " Schindler's List " . For a movie fan like me it's pure magic and loads of fun figuring out which clips come from what movie ( I'm proud to say I got 95 % of them ) . They reference and show classic clips from just about every famous film in Hollywood . Some go by a little TOO fast but I can understand that . Also the clips of music from various movies is fantastic . My favorites are the title music from " Gone With the Wind " and " Rocky " and " We're in the Money " from one of the Gold Diggers films . My only complaints ( and they're tiny ones ) - - some of the clips are WAY out of place . I caught " American in Paris " in the 1940s section ! And where was " Gigi " ? It was one of the few musicals to win an Academy Award as Best Picture . There were other omissions but these stood out . Still it's a great short . Anybody who has even a passing interest in movies will love this . A 10 all the way !
477912	463200	104745	10.0	A classic of gay cinema	Two HIV + men go on a road trip . Basically that's about it . It's not as depressing as it sounds . There's lots of humor in the movie but no pulling back on the anger they feel . The camera-work is shaky , the sound goes from audible to inaudible more than once and there really is no plot . Also , must we have the tired old stereotypes of two lesbians being psychopaths ? But the dialogue contains more truth than any Hollywood movie I've seen . For instance , at one point , one of the guys goes " Let's go to Washington and inject our blood in the President . Want to bet they'll find a cure in 30 seconds ? " Sadly , I believe they would . This was WAY ahead of its time in 1992 . It was angry , in your face and catch a look at a little message after the closing credits , . Grim , funny , powerful with a sad ( but truthful ) ending . Also Mike Dytri is one of the most beautiful , hunky men I've ever seen . A must-see for gay men .
477975	463200	424136	10.0	Disturbing but a must-see	A guy in his thirties Jeff ( Patrick Wilson ) meets teenage Hayley ( Ellen Page ) online . They agree to meet . They get along and she goes to his house with him . Then she drugs his drink . He wakes up tied to a chair and Hayley calling him a pedophile and prepared to teach him a lesson . But is he ? Basically just a 2 person movie and mostly all talk but absolutely fascinating . The will of wits between the two characters is just stunning and has you questioning if Hayley is right or if Jeff is innocent . It's incredible how the movie has you feeling pity for BOTH of the characters at different times . You're never sure who's right and how it will end up . The acting is superb . I must say Patrick Wilson shocked me . I saw him in " Angels in America " and " Phantom of the Opera " . I thought he was a very handsome man but a bland actor . This movie changed all that . He's just brilliant ! The agony and terror his character goes through seems all too real . This part demands a LOT out of any actor and he pulls it off . Very brave . Page is downright terrifying . Her character is ( obviously ) unstable and you're never sure what she'll do next . Again . . . a very difficult role but she pulls it off . Also the direction is great . Everything is done in closeups of the actors faces . At first it annoyed me - - then I realized it works in the movies favor giving it a very claustrophobic , uneasy feeling . This is not for everybody . It's grim and explicit ( in terms of dialogue ) and I'm sure there are moments which might have some guys bolting for the exits . I found it unsettling and fascinating . If you can handle the subject matter I strongly recommend this . A 10 .
478177	463200	113443	10.0	Touching and powerful drama	Brandon Theis ( Gregory Harrison ) and Nick Stark ( Eric Roberts ) have been lovers for years . Then Nick is diagnosed with HIV . Brandon promises to not leave him - - - but eventually does . He can't handle The HIV . A year later Nick is told he will die very soon of lesions in the brain . Rather than slowly become a vegetable and wither away , Nick decides to commit suicide . He invites all of his friends to a 2 day party - - at the end , he'll take the pills and die . Brandon finds out and attends the party . But does Nick want him there and will Nick be able to forgive him before he goes ? Strong , powerful movie . I saw it in a theatre in 1996 and cried my eyes out . I saw it 2 years later with a friend and we BOTH cried our eyes out ! Saw it again tonight - - cried again . This drama is harrowing at times and brings about questions about love , death with dignity , suicide , HIV . . . etc etc . But it never gets too maudlin and is always fascinating . Roberts is just superb as Nick . Strong , handsome , refusing to wither away . He also approaches his HIV condition with strength and humor - - as he should . Lee Grant is ( sadly ) wasted as his mother . Harrison is so-so as his boyfriend . Usually he's sort of stone-faced but there were a few moments that the looks on his face made me break down . There's one scene of him and Roberts just looking at each other across the room - - you can see the love , fear and hatred in their faces - - it's just great . And Harrison really delivers during the last 30 minutes of the movie . There's a huge cast in this movie - - Margaret Cho ( hilarious ) ; Marlee Matlin ( wasted ) ; Olivia Newton-John ( just great ) ; Bronson Pinchot ( overdoing the bitchiness a bit ) ; Bruce Davison ; Roddy McDowall . There's the problem - - there are too MANY characters ! I'm still not sure who McDowell was and Sally Kellerman shows up looking great but - - who is she ? We're never told . Also , the party scenes are scattershot - - the camera seems to linger around catching certain characters and snatches of their conversations . I also have a hard time believing that anyone has this many friends and they all keep quiet about him committing suicide . Still - - problems aside this works . I think this film hit too close for director / writer Randal Kleiser . Supposedly he went through the same things with his lover . When this movie was released he couldn't promote it . It came ( and went ) very quickly . That's really a shame . It's a strong , powerful movie that should be seen by everybody . And Roberts gives out one of his best performances . The scene when him and Harrison kiss is heart-breaking . Well worth catching - - an excellent drama . Just bring plenty of tissues - - you'll need them !
478400	463200	40068	10.0	One of the best horror comedies ever	Dracula ( Bela Lugosi ) wants to transfer the brain of Wilbur ( Lou Costello ) into Frankenstein ( Glenn Strange ) but Lawrence Talbot , the Wolf Man ( Lon Chaney ) , is out to stop him . This isn't as bad as the title suggests . By the time this was made in 1948 the Universal monster movies were dying . . . and so were Abbott & Costello's movies . So Universal decided to combine them and give them a big send-off . This is ( obviously ) a big-budget production with great special effects ( Lugosi turning into a bat ) and settings ( LOVE the castle on the island ) . They also got Chaney and Lugosi to recreate their most famous roles - - only Boris Karloff refused to play Frankenstein . The best thing about this movie is they DON'T make fun of the monsters - - they're all played straight and treated with respect . Abbott & Costello are there to provide the comedy and they do just great . The script was full of hilarious routines and one-liners that they pull off . Also there's a GREAT music score and it's very well-directed too . Acting is good all around . Abbott & Costello by that point had been together many years and worked well together . Lugosi is obviously enjoying playing Dracula again - - and he's just great . Chaney's performance is routine but he pulls of some lines that might have sounded silly otherwise . Also beautiful Jane Randolph is good in a supporting role . And listen for Vincent Price's voice at the end ! A great horror / comedy WELL worth seeing . I give this a 10 .
477714	463200	29604	10.0	Just great	Superb comedy / drama about a theatrical boarding house and its tenants ( all women ) focusing primarily on Katherine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers . A once in a lifetime cast , all of them in top form . The movie moves VERY quickly with non-stop wisecracks flying across the screen and a very depressing turn at the end . Also , there's no sappy romance subplot - very unusual for a 1930s film . The interplay between Rogers and Hepburn is incredible - - they're both holding their own against each other . Nominated for 7 Academy Awards ( including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress - - Andrea Leeds ) . A must-see . " The calla lillies are in bloom . . . "
477616	463200	51201	10.0	One of the best courtroom dramas ever	A man ( Tyrone Power ) is accused of allegedly murdering a woman . His wife ( Marlene Dietrich ) also believes he did it and testifies against him in court . A powerful , brilliant lawyer ( Charles Laughton ) believes Power is innocent and does his best to prove it . Sounds dull but it's not . I caught this on TV way back in the 1970s . I started watching it casually but very soon was caught up in it . The script is smart and , even though it's over 2 hours , it never feels too long . There are many ingenious twists and turns and an ending that ( I have to admit ) I didn't see coming at all . I've seen it many times since and never tire of it . The acting is great . Power is good in one of his last roles ; Laughton is just superb as the lawyer - - he throws out one liners or insults so casually that it's hard to believe he's just acting . I never found Dietrich that good of an actress - - I hate to admit this , but her accent always made me giggle . However she's great here - - especially at the end . Also Elsa Lanchester is a scream as Laughton's by the book nurse . Her and Laughton had a marriage of " convenience " for many years and their fondness for each other comes through making their verbal fights even funnier . A wonderful , exciting , fun courtroom drama - - one of the best ever made . Well worth catching . I give this a 10 .
477316	463200	20629	10.0	Still works after over 70 years !	A bunch of young enthisiastic German schoolboys volunteer for WWI believing it to be a noble and fun thing to do for their country . They quickly find out that war is a living hell . One of the first ( and best ) anti-war films ever made . It has problems - - the sound recording is not that good and the acting is bad - - the guys are either overacting or pretty wooden and there is some howlingly bad dialogue . But it still works . Lewis Milestones ' direction helps . The battle scenes are long , vicious and pretty graphic ( for 1930 ) and he really makes you feel all the pain and agony the soldiers endure . There are many unforgettable scenes : a young man , his eyes shot out , screaming and stumbling in a battlefield ; a young soldier trapped in a crater with a corpse of the enemy , the sequence where the soldiers are being driven mad by nonstop bombing from the enemy and a final scene that packs a real wallop . It's also interesting to see flashes of male nudity ( this was pre-Code ) and Lew Ayres so young and full of life . It's hard to believe such an old film can still work so strongly but this does . I can imagine the impact this had in 1930 . See the full 130 minute version . . . avoid the edited 105 minute one . Good luck finding a clear print with good sound .
477332	463200	86543	10.0	One of Verhoeven's best	In Holland a gay writer Gerard ( Jeroen Krabbe ) gives a lecture . He stays overnight with a beautiful woman Christine ( Renee Soutendijk ) and has sex with her ( by imagining she's a boy ) . He plans to leave the next day , but gets a look at a picture of Christine's hunky boyfriend Herman ( Thom Hoffman ) and decides to stay to have a try at him . Then things get strange . A big X-rated art house hit in the US in 1983 . Why was it X rated ? Let's see . . . there's strangulation , full frontal male and female nudity , castration , mutilation , simulated sex , a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people , a gay sex scene in a crypt . . . and it's all a comedy ! ! ! ! ! Paul Verhoeven made this after " Spetters " . " Spetters " was attacked by the critics for it's extreme sexual sequences and denounced as trash . So , Verhoeven filled this film with very obvious symbolism thinking the critics would think it was art and praise it . He was right ! Critics loved the film not realizing that Verhoeven was playing a big joke on them . Still , it's a great film . It's beautifully shot by Jan de Bont ( now a director himself ) and there's so much symbolism and obvious " hidden " layers in the dialogue that you're never bored . All the acting is great - - Krabbe plays a thoroughly despicable character but ( somehow ) has you rooting for him ; Soutendijk is just stunning to look at and plays her part to perfection - - the little smile she gives when Gerard agrees to stay with her is chilling ; Hoffman is extremely handsome with a great body - - he deserves credit for doing the church sequence and going at with Krabbe in the crypt . This is not for people easily offended or the weak of heart , but if you like extreme movies that playfully challenge you ( like me ) this is for you ! A 10 all the way .
478040	463200	63612	10.0	Truly one of a kind	Retired gangster Tony ( Jackie Gleason ) who's married to Flo ( Carol Channing ! ! ) is brought out of retirement by God ( Groucho Marx - - yes THAT Groucho Marx ) to rub out Packard ( Mickey Rooney ) . Problem is Packard is in prison . They're going to sneak Tony in so he can do the job . The plot is pretty straightforward but this movie gives some characters astonishing names , throws in VERY 60s designs and clothes , tons of unfunny lines and plot twists to show how " with it " the directors and such were . This was made when old Hollywood was at a loss at what attracted teenagers to movies like " Easy Rider " . So they got all these old directors and actors and wrote scripts that were totally abysmal and made zero sense ( old Hollywood thought " Easy Rider " was pointless - - it isn't ) . This is one of those movies . What's wrong with it ? Where to start ? It's impossible to list everything that happens in this train wreck ( worse than Britney Spears ) but here are a few high and low lights : Carol Channing trying to seduce Frankie Avalon ; God trying to seduce young teenage Darlene ; tons of dated dialogue showing how peaceful and loving hippies are ( sigh ) ; John Phillip Law playing a hippie named Stash - - he deserves credit for keeping a straight face while giving out the most nonsensical dialogue ever heard in a movie ; the great George Raft reduced to playing a skipper on a boat ; Gleason having an LSD trip which is a true jaw dropper ; Richard Kiel as a prison guard ; Law giving a code message over the phone ( OK - - THAT scene is great ! ) ; an entire prison spaced out on LSD ; Burgess Meredith as a warden ; Peter Lawford as a senator ( figures - - he was married to a Kennedy ) and a Garbage Pail number which will have you questioning your sanity . There's more but those hit me . The acting - - well who can tell ? The movie is all over the place . Still Gleason is actually pretty good and Channing chews the scenery . Marx ( in his last theatrical role ) was , sadly , pretty terrible as God . He doesn't even get any jokes to crack ! The movie goes barreling over the edge at the end with Channing singing the title song ( which is admittedly pretty catchy ) and ALL the closing credits are sung ! This is a one of a kind motion picture . Yeah it's terrible - - a bunch of older actors / producers / directors trying ( in vain ) to prove how " hip " they are . Still , you can't stop watching and I was never bored for one minute . I just sat there in amazement watching the movie unfold . Truly a camp classic and a 10 all the way ! This NEEDS a DVD transfer ! Paramount is probably ashamed of it - - they let TCM show it but they gave them a full frame print and it played early in the morning . Look - - if we can get jaw-droppers like the 1980 musical " The Apple " out there we can get this ! See it if you get the chance . Trust me - - you'll be amazed !
477283	463200	66580	10.0	Superb documentary	Oscar-winning documentary on the 3 day long concert back in 1969 . Despite more people showing up than was expected and running out of food , water and medical supplies and dealing with a torrential downpour everything went fine . There was no rioting , no violence . . . just people helping each other out . The film beautifully captures all this . It contains interviews with the kids attending the concert ( their views are absolutely incredible ) , people in the surrounding town , the police , media . . . all viewpoints are presented . Everything that comes through is tolerance , peace and love . The musical acts are varied - - you'll love some and hate others . For me the definite highlights were Joan Baez ; the Who ; Sha-Na-Na ; Joe Cocker ; Crosby Stills & Nash ; John Sebastian ; Country Joe McDonald ; Sly and the Family Stone and Jimi Hendrix . Also the sound is great and there is superb editing during the sequences with excellent use of multiple screens . I saw the directors cut with adds 40 minutes of music ( bringing the running time up to 3 hours and 40 minutes ) . They add Canned Heat , Jefferson Airplane , Janis Joplin and another number by Hendrix . Except for the Joplin footage none of it is really good or needed . The original 3 hour cut is fine . Warning - - there's lots of swearing , nudity , sex and drug taking . It didn't bother me , but it might bother others - - originally this got an X rating because of it ! A great one of a kind movie . Don't miss it !
477464	463200	70917	10.0	Exceptional but NOT a horror film	A police sergeant ( Edward Woodward ) goes to a remote island near Scotland hearing that a young girl is missing . When he gets there it seems no one has ever heard of her . . . and most say she never existed . He continues to search and the mystery gets deeper and deeper leading up to a very disturbing conclusion . I saw this during it's theatrical reissue in 1980 - - it was the cut 88 minute version . I was disappointed . It was advertised as a horror film and the edited version leaves gaping plot holes . I just saw the extended version on the DVD and loved it ! For one thing , as I said , it is NOT a horror film . I went in expecting that and didn't get it . It's actually a thriller with strong religious and sexual overtures . There's WAY too much to get into about the religious views in this film , and the sexual element is STRONG ! There's a whole circle of nude young women dancing around a fire , and an exceptional sequence in which a very erotic song is sung by a nude Britt Ekland . The mystery itself is fascinating but I really got caught up in the religious and social aspects presented in this film . Credit writer Anthony Shaffer for his script . Also the acting is great on all counts . Woodward deserves credit for playing such an unlikable character - - and STILL getting you to sympathize with him ! Also Hammer stars Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt ( whose part is brutally reduced in the short version ) are just great ! For one thing it's interesting to see them playing fairly " normal " people ( instead of vampires ) and they give out excellent performances . Lee especially is enjoying himself - - he did the film for free ! To this day he said it's his best movie - - he's right . An excellent , haunting thriller but it might be too much for some people . There's next to no blood or violence , but I do know some people who just found the ending a bit too much to handle . Still , it's a definite must-see . A deserved cult classic .
