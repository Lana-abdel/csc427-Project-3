478956	463200	65031	1.0	Homophobic and dull	A gay couple ( Rex Harrison and Richard Burton ) in 1960s England . Burton is a hairdresser ( of course ) and Harrison is an actor . They complain nonstop , tear each other apart verbally , dress horribly , hate their mothers and are depressed and full of self-loathing . I suppose this was revolutionary in 1969 but it's horribly offensive today . The movie was subtitled " A sad gay story " . The script is dull , the film looks horrible and the actors . . . Harrison minces around and preens so much I got very angry - - a sick , disgraceful performance . I heard he wasn't too proud of it either . Burton is actually OK - - he brings some dignity to his role . But this film is a total waste of time . It just shows gay men as being pathetic lonely creatures and is very condescending . Offensiveness aside it's sleep-inducing - - I kept dozing off ! Sick , depressing , homophobic . . . there's no reason to see this . Makes " Boys in the Band " look like a comedy . Dudley Moore did the music ! ! !
479429	463200	118688	1.0	Talk about overkill !	Batman ( George Clooney ) and Robin battle Mr . Freeze ( Arnold Schwarzenegger ) and Poison Ivy ( Uma Thurman ) . Meanwhile Alfred ( Michael Gough ) is dying and his niece ( Alicia Silverstone ) visits and becomes Batgirl ! Oh yeah - - and Bane is helping Ivy . . . Wow - - what a MESS ! I never liked the first two Batman films ( too dark and violent ) . The third was light but fun . This is just moronic from the word go . There are tons of bad jokes flying left and right from heroes and villains ( if Arnie had made one more " cold " joke I would have screamed ! ) . No dialogue - - just stupid jokes . I knew I was in trouble during the first big fight sequence : Batman and Robin are battling Mr . Freeze but are sliding on the ice he produces . They're on their backs boots in the air , click the boots together . . . and SKATES pop out ! ! ! ! ! Even for a comic book film that was ridiculous ! The plot is thin to begin with , but at the end it's just completely incomprehensible . Its like the screenwriters threw up their hands and gave up . The movie is always throwing things at you - - never stopping for breath . At first it's fun . . . but it wears you down . There's an entire motorcycle race thrown in for no reason ! GREAT special effects . . . but that's all there is . Also the homoeroticism in here is upped to a ridiculous degree . Can ANYONE explain why Batman and Robins suits have nipples ? ? ? ? And why doesn't Silverstone's suit have them ? Isn't that sexist ? And why does O'Donnell have a bigger cod piece than Clooney ? Acting is pretty poor . Clooney ( who admits that he hated the film ) looks uncomfortable and ( he says ) he played Bruce Wayne as gay . I never caught that though - - and I'm gay ! O'Donnell is drop dead handsome and drop dead bland . He plays Robin as an obnoxious brat - - again ( he did it in " Batman Forever " too ) . I kept waiting for Clooney to deck him . Silverstone is OK I guess . Gough is given nothing to do but look sick . Schwarzenegger - - he never COULD act and his reciting of the " comic " lines are painful . Thurman seems so totally lost that she got desperate - - she vamps it up to an embarrassing degree . Her lines were SO pathetic I actually groaned aloud and rolled my eyes a few times ! Only John Glover is any fun by hamming it up mercilessly as the mad ( sigh ) scientist who creates Bane . Big , loud and incredibly stupid . It's easy to see why this killed the Batman franchise .
478435	463200	171344	1.0	Boring and silly	First off , the title is wrong . There are girls and there is a gang but they're only incidental to the story . Most of the movie deals with a bunch of very overage " teenagers " getting hooked on heroin . Purportedly this movie is supposed to be a warning against it , yet it shows them all having a great time while on it ! They're singing , dancing ( a sequence that goes on for 10 minutes . Why ? To eat up running time ! ) and having sex . . . so what it they're hooked ? There's even a sequence which shows - - step by step - - how to inject heroin ! Very cheaply done , all horrible acting with uproarious dialogue . Also the worst use of music ever ! Most of the time it doesn't even fit the scene ! It's really hard to explain how totally worthless this movie is . Not even bad / good . Skip it .
477634	463200	65481	1.0	Well acted but sleazy and slow	Silly psychological drama about Ma Barker and her sons who robbed and killed in the 1920s . Roger Corman directed this . . . it seems like he was actually trying to do a serious movie . . . sadly , it doesn't work at all . This movie has a following but damned if I know why . It is very well-acted but the script and direction ramble all over the place . Also I found most of the actors dialogue unintelligible - - they're all putting on stupid Southern accents which don't help . Also , the movie is VERY sleazy . Rape , murder , incest , torture , beatings , drug abuse , homosexuality ( portrayed negatively unfortunately ) . . . you name it . I'm no prude , but this movie rubs your face in it . For instance , the opening scene has a young girl ( about 13 ) being held down by her brothers while her father rapes her ! This is ALMOST worth seeing to see Shelley Winters chewing the scenery as Ma and Robert DeNiro before he hit it big . All in all , a must miss .
477473	463200	65478	1.0	Just incredible	Young , unstable beautiful Victoria ( Maria de Aragon ) falls in love with young , hunky doctor Craig ( Peter Carpenter ) who's caring for her rich , sick father . She plans to inherit all his money when he dies . Then Dr . Craig is being blackmailed and needs a lot of money FAST ! And Victoria's father is near death . Did I mention Victoria was unstable ? Sleazy piece of garbage . The script is silly to put it mildly with a REAL stupid ending ; terrible direction in which characters speaking aren't even in the frame - - one whole conversation is only shot from the waist down ! ; annoying , horrid 70s music which doesn't even remotely fit the on screen antics and just unbelievably bad acting by EVERYBODY ! It's truly astonishing to see how badly EVERY scene is acted - - you just stare at the TV screen in disbelief . The movie is chock full of unpleasant characters , plenty of gratuitous female nudity and cheap sex - - including a hysterically bad sequence between de Aragon and Carpenter . As for the actors themselves - - they were all hired for their looks and bodies - - not acting ability . Virtually every female member of the cast has multiple nude scenes and even Carpenter bares his butt briefly once or twice . The DVD of this makes this movie look better than it deserves . The picture and sound are crystal clear and the colors are strong and vibrant . This could be used in film school - - an example of how NOT to do a movie ! Also this isn't really a horror film - - just a stupid , sleazy " drama " . Bottom of the barrel - - I give it a 1 .
479676	463200	118423	1.0	Easily one of the worst TV shows ever	Dreadful sitcom which has seems to have ( thankfully ) faded from public memory . Pauly Shore plays a man living at home with his widowed father . His father marries a hot young blonde who Pauly lusts after . . . but it's him MOM ! Predictable " jokes " and complication ensue . Truly sick and tasteless . Every single joke was unfunny and painfully obvious . This also has the dubious award for having more jokes about womens breasts than any other sitcom in history . I watched only two shows in utter horror . This played on FOX . I realize their standards were low but THIS low ? ? ? ? Completely forgotten and will hopefully stay that way . I wish IMDb had negative numbers . . . .
478807	463200	65553	1.0	What the hell ? ? ? ? ? ?	Why is Mario Bava considered such a great horror film director ? He's done some great films , but for every " Black Sunday " there's five like " Lisa and the Devil " , " Rabid Dogs " , " Black Sabbath " and this film . This is probably his worst ( and that's saying something ) . This is total , utter crap . A bunch of uninteresting people are killed off one by one on an isolated island . That's about it . It's VERY badly dubbed ( even the sound effects are off - - notice during the fight scene between two guys ) ; the acting is wooden ( to put it nicely ) ; the plot makes no sense especially at the ending where all logic is thrown out the window ; the 70s clothes are horrendous ; there's needless female nudity thrown in and the WORST music I've ever heard in my life - - it almost never fits the scenes it's played in ! Even Bava's usual great direction is off - - the movie takes place all in bright sunlight - - Bava is at his best filming in shadow or darkness . Even the murders are dull . Pointless , stupid and boring . A total disaster . P . S . The full meaning behind the title is real stupid !
478043	463200	91799	1.0	Why ?	OK - - " Psycho " is an acknowledged classic horror film . " Psycho II " was , surprisingly , a very good sequel with an intricate plot . They should have stopped there . This needless third one has a bad plot ( which contradicts the second one ) , lazy acting ( Perkins was very sick when he made this . . . and it shows ) and shoves blood , gore and nudity in your face . The first one had none of that and the second one used it sparingly . Compared to this Gus Van Sant's remake of " Psycho " looks like a masterpiece . Some of the dialogue in here was laughably bad and the scene where someone sees Norman as Mother as the Virgin Mary was enough to make me almost run screaming from the room . Why did they do this ? Perkins must have been desperate for the money . Best forgotten . Probably the worst horror sequel ever . . . and that's saying a lot !
478105	463200	69994	1.0	To avoid fainting keep repeating . . . . it's only a movie . . . it's only a movie . . . . it's only a movie . . .	That was the tag line used to sell this movie back in 1973 . It played at mostly drive-ins along with " Last House on the Left " and " The House That Vanished " . This triple feature was so incredibly popular it kept playing at drive-ins into the mid 80s ! Never saw " House That Vanished " but " Last House . . . " was sadistic trash . This is boring trash ! A " horror " film about inmates at a sanitarium who are getting a little out of control . Young , beautiful nurse Charlotte Beale ( Rosie Holotik ) comes to work there . She finds a new administrator under control - - Dr . Masters ( Annabelle Weenick ) . The former one had been killed by one of his patients . But things are fine now . . . or are they ? There is a plot twist in this which you'll probably see coming from a mile away - - but I still won't reveal it . This has a nice murder at the beginning and turns into an all out bloodbath at the end - - - but everything in the middle is dull ! It just has a bunch of horrible bad actors portraying mental patients - - and very badly too . Padded endlessly with repititous scenes , pointless dialogues , horribly unfunny " humor " and some really gratuitous nudity . Basically a 30 minute feature dragged out to 90 minutes . There is some good acting by Holotik and Weenick and also Betty Chandler as Allyson - - but that's about it . ALMOST worth seeing for the incredible gore at the end . . . ALMOST . For drive-in cultists only . Otherwise avoid .
477164	463200	582	1.0	Hilarious	Silly short silent is NOT " Ben-Hur " . It's highlights from the book with cards filling in the ( many ) gaps . The sets are cardboard cut-outs ( pretty obviously ) , ALL the acting is bad and the " direction " is virtually nonexistent . I suppose it's got some historical value as the very first version of the story but is totally lacking in entertainment value . See it for laughs only .
477943	463200	95853	1.0	Pretty bad	A teenager who seems to have it all commits suicide . It leaves his family and his best friend ( Keanu Reeves ) asking a lot of questions . . . and blaming themselves . Good idea , badly handled . For starters this HAS been done before 1988 - - mostly in TV movies and After School Specials . Aside from some swearing and dialogue ( hence the PG-13 rating ) this added nothing new . The outcome is predictable and Reeve's attempts at acting were truly painful to watch . He's good NOW but not in 1988 . Aside from that his character was dressed like a slob and always looked so dirty is was hard to build up sympathy . That aside the movie is dull . I saw every scene coming and every " surprise " was telegraphed . I basically couldn't wait for this thing to get over . I have a vague recollection of seeing it in a theatre in 1988 and hating it ( it bombed BADLY ) . It still looks lousy almost 20 years later . The subject is worth handling but it's been done better ( with better acting ) in countless other movies . " Ordinary People " comes to mind . You can skip this one .
478357	463200	82934	1.0	Poorly cast and dull	In the 1920s drifter Frank Chambers ( Jack Nicholson ) starts doing odd jobs for an alcoholic cafe owner Nick ( John Colicos ) . He then meets Nick's sexy young wife ( Jessica Lange ) . Sex and murder follow . The 1946 version was perfect so , naturally , Hollywood had to redo it . They claimed the original had to be toned down because of the Hays Code ( this is true ) . This version is true to the book - - but bad casting and a SLOW pace destroy it . For starters Nicholson is far too old for the role - - they needed someone in his 20s or 30s . It seems ridiculous that Lange would fall for someone like him . Also Lange was , at that point , still learning as an actress . She's not terrible but not as good as she usually is either . The sex scenes ( which were promoted nonstop during the films production ) aren't much . They're more violent than erotic and seriously - - do YOU want to see Nicholson nude ? Also the story is morbid and slow-moving - - I was seriously bored and depressed halfway through . Nicholson manages to throw in one of his worst performances and , as I said before , Lange isn't that good . This was a major bomb ( for some reason the studio chose to release this around Christmas ! ) and has rightfully been forgotten . A 1 .
479461	463200	82748	1.0	Just dreadful	Film takes place in Massachusetts ( obviously it was shot in Spain ) . It starts in the 1940s with a mother catching her young son putting together a jigsaw puzzle of a naked woman . She freaks out , yells at him and orders him to get a plastic trash bag ( which didn't exist in the 1940s ) . He leaves , comes back in with an ax and hacks mommy to pieces . That's the OPENING SCENE ! ! ! ! Then it cuts to 1983 at a college where somebody is hacking young female students into pieces . But who . . . and why ? You won't really care . Aside from Christopher George and Lynda Day George all the actors are ( badly ) dubbed ( I love how the dean of a MA college has an ENGLISH accent ) . The story doesn't make a lick of sense , the gore is explicit and pretty sick ( this was released unrated in the US ) and it's surprisingly dull at times . Even the casting was way off - - one of the characters is ( purportedly ) the school stud but he's played by a short , below average looking guy with no body whatsoever ! There's a sequence with him and a woman in bed which is hilarious . Basically this film was made to show off tons of blood and gore . I have no problem with that at all - - but that's all the movie has . Supposedly the dreadful dubbing was purportedly done badly so people would laugh at it . . . . but it's kind of hard to laugh at any movie which is shoving VERY explicit gore in your face . I saw it in a theatre in 1983 and no one laughed once . The stupidest murder has to be when one girl is decapitated by HEDGE TRIMMERS - - in broad daylight - - on a college campus - - and NOBODY SEES ANYTHING ! That's about when I gave up on the film - - they're treating the audience like they're full of idiots . And the final revelation of who the killer is was predictable and there's a truly pathetic " shock " at the end . A very sick , nasty , stupid , dull horror film . For gore completists only
479352	463200	82806	1.0	Bottom of the barrel	The story has already been summarized by previous posters so I won't bother . This is a rock-bottom , stupid , boring , horrendous " Halloween " clone - - HORROR movie is right ! The plot is silly ( killing people for every hour it turns midnight across the U . S . - - please ! ) , the performances are truly bad ( it's truly astounding at how bad Roz Kelly was - - you just stare at the screen in amazement . It's no wonder she's not in films anymore ) . Also the music - - this was NOT punk rock ! ! ! ! This is some Hollywood studios version of it . Also the " dances " the kids did were hilariously bad ( also those are the cleanest punks I've ever seen ) . But , more often than not , I was bored . Bad acting ( everybody is bad - - I mean EVERYBODY ) , a plot that is totally predictable ( I figured out the killer within 10 minutes ) , very minor gore ( yes , that's a problem - - this IS an early 80s slasher film after all ! ) , unlikable characters , HUGE gaps in logic . . . need I go on ? A must-miss . It might be fun to sit around watching it with a bunch of friends and tear it apart .
477667	463200	156843	1.0	Not as much fun as " Plan 9 "	Ed Wood's followup to " Plan 9 from Outer Space " . Lt . Bradford ( Duke Moore ) and patrolman Paul Kelton ( Paul Marco ) go investigate a deserted house where strange things are happening . There they find Dr . Acula ( sigh ) ( Keene Dunacn ) who's a phony spiritualist trying to bilk wealthy people by " contacting " their dead spouses . This is the legendary Wood film that sat unreleased for 25 YEARS because Wood couldn't pay the lab bill ! It has the typical Wood ingredients - - a bad script , lousy acting ( although Moore wasn't bad ) , a stubborn refusal to make sense and dreadful direction and editing . However it's not as bad ( or as funny ) as " Plan 9 " or " Bride of the Monster " were . This is just pretty boring stuff . It has some fun moments - - Tor Johnson's truly laughable makeup job and a bewildering séance ( where someone is shot at multiple times and someone is knocked out cold - - and no one bats an eyelash ) but it's mostly just dull . Even Criswell ( narrating from a coffin this time ) seems to just be going through the motions . And good luck explaining what the Black Ghost is doing in this ! Pretty bad . . . even for Wood . I give it a 1 .
477767	463200	285462	1.0	Homophobic , sexist , stupid and dull	Alleged " comedy " about two straight men - - Jerry ( Cuba Gooding Jr . ) and Nick ( Horatio Sanz ) - - who mistakenly get stuck on a gay cruise . Naturally all the gay men are blatantly offensive stereotypes - - sex-obsessed , feminine , lisping and ( of course ) they all love drag . About a half hour in they run into a all-female Swedish sun tanning team ( don't ask ) so we can have juvenile sexist sex jokes and show women in tiny bikinis . A few offensive lesbian jokes are thrown in too . As a gay man I found this horribly offensive and not even remotely funny . A certain ice sculpture shown made me want to throw something heavy at the TV . I'm sick and tired of all gay men being shown as lisping , feminine people . To make things worse the film throws in a few short lines about how great gay people are - - then goes right back to comic gay-bashing . And , worst of all , we have the very unfunny Will Ferrell do a cameo . The film has a few OK things - - Roger Moore plays a gay man very well , the soundtrack is good and the overreaction of Gooding and Sanz when they find they're on the wrong cruise is somewhat amusing . The acting doesn't really help . Gooding overacts constantly - - he got annoying real quick ( can we take back that Oscar he got ? ) ; Sanz is obnoxious and unfunny ; Roselyn Sanchez has a few good moments and Vicica A . Fox pops up briefly doing OK . This film was a HUGE bomb at the box office ( for good reason ) and is just a stupid piece of garbage . Everybody connected with this should be embarrassed . I really wish I could rate this lower than 1 .
478404	463200	256415	2.0	Annoying and unfunny	I really wanted to like this movie - - I love romantic comedy-dramas ( like " Steel Magnolias " ) and I think Reese Witherspoon is a fantastic actress . But I really hated this movie . The plot has Melanie Carmichael ( Witherspoon ) , a successful fashion designer in NY , being proposed to by rich , handsome , wealthy son of the mayor ( Patrick Dempsey ) . She accepts without telling him one teensy problem - - she's still married to Jake ( Josh Lucas ) who she left in Alabama before going to NY . She goes back there to get him to sign the divorce papers . He refuses and things get out of control . Annoyingly predictable , dully made , tiredly politically correct and incredibly unfunny " comedy " . All the characters are cliches and every twist and turn is telegraphed a mile away . And it's just not funny ! I think I laughed twice ( maybe ) . The only thing that made this bearable is the acting . Dempsey , Lucas , Candice Bergen ( as the mayor of NY ! ) , Fred Ward , Mary Kay Place are all just great - - especially Lucas . He's so handsome and full of charisma - - a few closeups of him took my breath away . Best of all is Witherspoon . It's her show and she pulls it off . She's bright , full of energy , beautiful and one hell of an actress . She's got a great future ahead of her . Let's hope next time she gets a better script .
479592	463200	74258	2.0	This wowed me when I was 14 . . .	A couple ( Oliver Reed and Karen Black ) , their young son ( Lee Montgomery ) and aunt ( Bette Davis ! ) become caretakers for this huge Gothic mansion , in the middle of nowhere , for the summer . Everything seems fine at first but then Black becomes obsessed with the house , Reed starts having some truly disturbing nightmares and the feisty old aunt begins to get ill . . . and the son is terrified . I saw this at a theatre when I was 14 . It was packed with kids my age ( the film is PG ) and I remember it scaring me . It all led up to a bloody climax which left my audience screaming . Seeing it 30 years later I can't see why I ever liked this . The film is too long , VERY slow and the ultimate resolution struck me as pretty stupid . Nothing really happens until the very end . I was basically bored . Also Reed gives out a horrible performance - - but Davis hated him and kept telling him off - - that could account for it . Davis hated this film . She complained long and loud about the script and would basically tell off the crew and director daily . She only got along with Black and Montgomery . The film gets a 2 for a few reasons - - Davis ( despite hating it ) is good ; Black and Montgomery aren't bad ; the visions Reed has are still pretty scary and the ending really jolts you ( don't see it on commercial TV - - it's edited ) . Still that doesn't save it . Bette Davis completists might want to tune in . . . but that's it .
479194	463200	91310	3.0	Justly forgotten	Boring , utterly predictable soap opera . Mary Tyler Moore is married to Ted Danson who's having an affair with Christine Lahti . Moore is friends with Lahti and doesn't know about the cheating . Danson dies in an accident and Lahti is pregnant with his baby . YAWN ! I'm ashamed to admit I paid money to see this in a theatre in 1986 . I liked all three stars but even their considerable talents couldn't pull this off . I CONSTANTLY knew what was going to happen . Like another poster said - - this plays like a PG-rated Lifetime movie . It does have Lahti swearing nonstop at one point and even Moore lets loose once ! Also there's a pointless shots of topless women playing football ( ! ! ! ) . Other than that it's TV friendly . The only good thing about this was Timothy Gibbs playing Moore and Danson's teenage son . Very handsome and quite a good actor . That aside there's nothing to recommend this . You've seen it before . . . and done better . It's obviously been forgotten . Skip it .
479072	463200	303732	3.0	Never saw the first . . .	. . . but I heard it's dreadful . This one isn't much good either . A bunch of annoying camp counselors are closing down a summer camp for the winter . A masked killer suddenly shows up and starts killing them off one by one . Who is it and why ? The movie has its good points - - it's pretty well directed ; the script isn't TOO bad and the murder scenes are VERY gory , brutal and scary . That's about it for compliments . That aside the movie is atrociously sexist - - there is a pointless shower sequence and sex scene in which the women's breasts are shown constantly ( in closeup no less ) . Meanwhile next to nothing is shown by the guys . I'm sick and tired of filmmakers throwing pointless female nudity in a film . This might shock them but not EVERY male viewer wants to see that . I see a horror film to be scared - - not have nudity rubbed in my face . It's degrading . If you're going to show it on the girls why not show what the guys have ? Be an equal opportunity sexist ! That aside the movie is slow-moving , the acting is lousy ( with Kelly Gunning as Mike being the worst ) and the final chase with the killer after the final girl goes on FOREVER ! So I've seen worse but I've definetely seen better . The appalling sexism in this really got to me . I give it a 3 .
479150	463200	87298	3.0	The Final ( HA ) Chapter	This starts off great with a replay of parts 1-3 then picks up where part 3 ended with Jason supposedly dead . He's carted off to the morgue where he quickly comes to life , kills a few people and is off to Crystal Lake to kill more . I'm not sure it's Crystal Lake - - it's never made clear . Also WHY is he killing these people ? Anyways , there's a family living there now - - Mrs . Jarvis ( Joan Freeman ) , daughter Trish ( Kimberly Beck ) and son Tommy ( Corey Feldman ) . The house next to them is being rented by a bunch of brainless teenagers . You can pretty much figure out what happens next . Some of the negative things about this pic : The body count has been upped - - 6 guys and 6 girls and ( in a hysterically fake scene ) 1 dog ; as in part 3 , characters are just introduced to be killed ( the hitch hiker and the twins ) ; there's a skinny dipping scene which gives us female AND male nudity and Jason seems to know exactly where everyone will be so he can kill them ( I love it when he happens to be outside the house , standing on a ledge to kill someone ! ) Also people scream bloody murder while being killed - - and no one hears a thing . Terrible dialogue and acting too ( as usual ) . There are some good things about the film . . . Tom Savini's special effects are very realistic ; Joan Freeman , Peter Barton and Kimberly Beck aren't bad ( I LOVE how Beck fights Jason back at the end ) ; Feldman is OK too ; the last 20 minutes or so are good ( that's why I'm giving this a 3 ) with some real gruesome stuff when Jason is killed . I'm surprised the MPAA let some of the stuff in the picture . . . but I guess they thought this was it so they let it pass . There are two truly bad mistakes in the film - - When Jason kills the dog notice the dog's " corpse " is wagging its tail as it's thrown out the window ! Joan Freeman's character disappears completely from the movie - - we're left to assume she's dead . They did film a scene where Beck discovers her corpse but it was cut out - - director Joe Zito figures everyone knew she was dead so why bother keeping it in . ( ? ? ? ? ? ? ) This was supposed to be it for the series but it made plenty of money so Paramount continued it . For this series this isn't bad - - but that's not saying much . I give it a 3 .
478562	463200	60921	3.0	Talk about dated !	A Russian submarine is accidentally grounded off the coat of a small New England island named Gloucester Island ( which is fictional ) . Some Russians ( headed by Alan Arkin ) go to the island to get help . Naturally everybody on the island thinks they're being invaded . " Hilarious " complications ensure . I realize this has is fans - - but most people who like it seem to have fond memories of seeing it as children . I was too young to see it when it came out and I personally find this a bad movie . It found it loud , labored , slow-moving and far too long . Also it isn't funny - - not even once . I think I smirked once but that was it . I also fail to see the humor when all the townspeople grab their guns automatically to go and kill all the Russauins . It all leads up to a horribly manipulative ending which just made me angry . Dull and unfunny . The few saving assets are some beautiful cinematography ( even though it wasn't shot anywhere near New England ) and appealing performances by Alan Arkin ( nominated for this ) and John Phillip Law ( blue eyes blazing ) . Seriously - - THIS was nominated for Best Picture ? ? ? I realize it was a big hit at the time of its release but it doesn't age well at all . I'm being generous by giving this a 3 .
478461	463200	57093	3.0	Boy - - my taste must have been LOW as a kid : )	I remember seeing this a few times on TV as a kid . I vaguely remember liking it and had an amusing time hearing Judy Garland doing vocals for an animated cat ! Seeing it now ( about 30 years later ) I can't figure out WHAT I ever liked about this . The story is dull , silly and trite and the animation is ( and I'm being nice ) 4th rate . I've seen episodes of " The Flintstones " with better animation that this ! The songs were entirely forgettable , the characters were ALL annoying and it was a struggle to make it through to the end . This is getting three stars just for the vocals of Garland and Robert Goulet - - they even make the bland songs sound OK . Very young children might like this but anyone over the age of eight will be bored out of their minds ! Easy to see why this is mostly forgotten .
477523	463200	67124	3.0	Pretty poor	" Comedy " about two warring Mafia gangs in Brooklyn . Purportedly the original book is hilarious and this movie has a great cast - - but something went wrong . The jokes aren't very funny and the cast just seems to be unable to put across the punchlines . Flat direction doesn't help either . I'm only giving it a 3 for Leigh-Taylor Young and Robert DeNiro ( who are both very good and play a very appealing couple ) and Jo Van Fleet who has the movie's only funny lines in a very broad , over the top , amusing manner . But , all in all , this really isn't worth seeing .
477742	463200	244799	4.0	Too much boring strip teases	Compilation of coming attractions of some VERY odd , stupid and downright sleazy movies . Highlights are coming attractions for : " Maihuana " ( which causes women to laugh hysterically , disrobe and run around nude ! ) ; " The Flesh Merchant " ; " Pin-Down Girls " ( about female wrestlers ) ; " Curfew Breakers " ( ! ! ! ) ; a hysterical PSA AGAINST cable and pay TV ; " The Smut Peddler " ; " Strange Rampage " ; " Young Seducers " ( which has VERY explicit female nudity ) ; " Just for the Hell Of it " and " Jailbait Babysitter " ! This is fun but it gets repetitious - - even at just 60 minutes . And there's a truly boring montage of strip tease acts ( not everything comes off BTW ) . It gets a 4 for the coming attractions . Not for the kids - - some of this material is X rated .
478090	463200	74356	4.0	MIGHT scare kids	Boring , obvious " horror " film about 2 idiots who go to search for the title creature . Obviously this is just another ripoff of the legend of Bigfoot . I saw this back in 1976 at a local theatre when I was 14 . I went because the local paper gave it a positive write up . I also dragged along my 9 year old brother and his friends . Basically they LOVED it . They said it was scary and " cool " . I did not agree at all . I was bored and extremely angry - - I expected them to SHOW the creature but ( except for one half-way clear shot ) they don't . You hear it's roar and you might see a hand or a foot but that's about it . In retrospect this was probably a good idea - - the unseen is much more scary than what we CAN see . But when you're a young kid you could care less about subtlety - - you want to SEE the monster . This movie came ( and went ) without a trace . It hasn't popped up on VHS or DVD yet ( and hopefully won't ) . I give it a 4 because it IS an OK monster movie for kids - - YOUNG kids . All others - - stay away .
478556	463200	35784	4.0	Rightfully forgotten but has its moments	The print I saw of this was in terrible shape with sometimes inaudible sound so my synopsis may be a little off . The evil Dr . Elwyn Clayton ( George Zucco ) is being laid to rest . His twin brother Dr . Lloyd Clayton ( Zucco again ) is a kind man . He oversees his brother's funeral and begins to burn papers of the work he was doing . Elwyn's assistant Zolarr ( Dwight Frye playing a hunchback - - again ) tries to stop him to no avail . Then Elwyn ( somehow ) rises from the dead as a vampire . He goes after his niece Gayle ( Mary Caslisle ) who begins to slowly die of blood loss and the townspeople think Lloyd is responsible . . . OK - - the acting is pretty bad ( except for Zucco and Frye ) with a truly terrible performance by Fern Emmett ( playing Kate ) ; the dialogue is terrible ; the direction is pedestrian and the sets show the VERY low budget this picture was made on . Still this isn't a total disaster . The plot is ( to say the least ) pretty interesting and Zucco has a field day playing two brothers . As Elwyn he really chews the scenery in an enjoyable way . Also it's impossible to dismiss any movie that has Frye as a humpbacked assistant . There are also some eerie scenes involving Frye moving Clayton's coffin around in a graveyard . So this is pretty badly done ( and the only prints available seem to be in terrible shape ) but it has it's moments . Horror fans might want to take a look .
477967	463200	106400	4.0	Silly	I have to admit that I've never seen a full episode of the TV series . I've seen bits and pieces of enough to know the basic premise and the characters . This is just to let you know that I'm reviewing it without comparing it to the TV series . But still - - with the silly premise who ever thought this would work as a full length film ? The Clampetts strike oil , become billionaires and move to Beverly Hills . An evil bank assistant ( Rob Schneider ) and his girlfriend ( Lea Thompson ) plan to swindle them out of it all . There's very little plot , even for 90 minutes . There are some good jokes but most range from lame to insultingly stupid . It's all up to the actors to carry this off . Luckily , they're up to it . Deidrich Bader is very good as dumb as dirt Jethro ( and his sister ) - - he's full of life , engaging and has a great smile . Dabney Coleman is good but given nothing to work with as Mr . Drysdale . Erika Eleniack is cute and perky as Elly May - - she can't act but she was hired for her body not comedic talent . Cloris Leachman is good but a little too loud as Granny . Lilly Tomlin is hysterical as Miss Hathaway - - she looks great and provides the few true laughs in the film . The late Jim Varney is surprisingly very good as Jed - - who would have thought ? Schneider and Thompson try to be funny but their material is very poor . Guest appearances by Buddy Ebsen , Dolly Parton and Zsa Zsa Gabor ( in a VERY dated joke ) don't help . With a better script this could have been great . As it is , it's almost worth seeing for the actors ( especially Tomlin ) . Maybe the TV series is better . . .
478399	463200	300556	4.0	Big , loud , noisy . . . and dull	Silly time travel movie . A archaeologist ( somehow ) finds a " wormhole " to 1347 France . That's when there was a huge battle ( or something . . . history isn't my best subject ) . He goes back to get artifacts . . . and never returns . So his stupid son ( Paul Walker ) and friends ( Gerard Butler , Frances O'Connor and some others who are just there to get killed ) travel back to find him . Naturally everything goes wrong and they may be stuck there for good . What's wrong with this movie ? Just about everything . The script is REAL stupid . . . full of implausible situations and characters and some truly jaw-dropping twists and turns . Aside from the dubious " science " I find it hard to believe a bunch of people from 2003 could even remotely understand French from 1347 . Yet they have no trouble talking here . The stupidest subplot ( and that's saying a bit ) has Butler's character falling in love ( very quickly ) with a French lady who he knows will be killed . Oh , the irony ( sarcasm ) ! There are tons of explosions and fights to keep the audience awake . It all ends with a big huge battle which LOOKS expensive but I was bored silly . There's also lots of casual violence and killings in the movie - - but there's never any blood so that makes it OK for a PG-13 rating . As for the acting - - Paul Walker ( the " star " ) is VERY handsome with a nice body but simply can't act - - at ALL ! His blank stare ( flashing his big baby blue eyes ) quickly becomes annoying . I was SO hoping he would get killed . He makes Keanu Reeves look like an accomplished actor . The rest of the cast either overacts ( Butler and O'Connor ) , underacts ( Billy Connolly ) or just have this pained look on their faces ( understandable ) . The biggest surprise was Gerard Butler being so bad . He's been very good in other movies . This was a HUGE box office bomb - - it's easy to see why . Purportedly if you're a scientist or a history major this is hysterically funny . Otherwise stay away . I give it a 4 .
479681	463200	75314	4.0	Come on ! A masterpiece ? I think not .	Travis Bickle ( Robert De Niro ) is a Vietnam war veteran who drives a cab in NYC . NYC is shown as an utter hellhole - - full of unpleasant characters and events . He tries to romance classy rick Betsy ( Cybill Shepherd ) but shocks her instead . He meets 12 year old prostitute Iris ( Jodie Foster ) and decides to save her from her sadistic pimp ( Harvey Keitel ) . I've seen this multiple times over the years and it's always escaped me why people find this a masterpiece . It's slow , boring and pointless . I mean really - - what was Scorsese trying to show or tell us with this movie ? We just spend two hours watching a sick pathetic man and his final explosion of violence . And the point is . . . ? There are credibility gaps galore - - when he first takes out Betsy he takes her to see a porno movie ! No way is he so dumb that he's take a classy woman like her to that . He shoots four ( I believe ) guys dead to " save " Iris yet is never punished for the crime . And just why was he trying to save her ? She didn't ask him . Why not just report it to the police ? This deserves just one star but the acting of Keitel and especially De Niro and Foster adds some points . Only for those who enjoy wallowing in sick unpleasant situations and characters for no good reason for two hours .
478639	463200	51724	4.0	A searing expose on teenage drug use ! Just kidding	Silly exploitation movie . It's about tough kid Tony ( Russ Tamblyn ) going to live with his nymphomaniac aunt ( Mamie Van Doren ) and attending a new school . He meets the head kid J . I . ( John Drew Barrymore ) , gets involved with his girlfriend Joan ( Diane Jergens ) and gets involved with selling drugs . But Tony may not be who he seems to be . At times funny but mostly boring teen flick . This throws reality out the window right at the beginning with Jerry Lee Lewis on the back of a truck ( with a band no less ) " singing " a tune and all the " high school " kids ( they're easily all in their 20s ) start dancing ! The 50s slang is way out of date and makes most of the " teenagers " sound like a bunch of idiots . The story is predictable and the attempt to sell this as a serious drug movie are just laughable . And seriously - - Russ Tamblyn as a tough kid ? ? ? ? ? ? He's terrible but he's totally miscast and the dialogue does him no favors . Barrymore adopts a hysterically stupid Southern accent and Van Doren shows off her " assets " by wearing VERY tight shirts ! Sterling and Jergens try to act but nobody could make this work . I suppose this might be fun for some people but I was mostly bored . Might be worth catching to see some of the actors so young and Michael Landon in a small role but the dull story , bad acting and real jaw-dropping vamping by Van Doren make this a chore to sit through . I give it a 4 .
478913	463200	39826	5.0	Great color - - little else	The adventures of Sinbad ( Douglas Fairbanks Jr . ) . Maureen O'Hara plays the love interest and Anthony Quinn plays the villain . A VERY elaborate film from RKO Radio Pictures . The sets are huge , the costumes beautiful and the color is great . . . but I really didn't enjoy this . For starters , Fairbanks is in lousy shape and looks way too old for the role ( he was 38 ) . Also he overacts CONSTANTLY to an embarrassing degree . He's supposed to be dashing and charming - - he comes across as loudmouthed and immature . And what's with that silly arm gesture he gave during the " fights " ? The fights basically had him doing acrobatics and little else . Quinn underacts and plays an Arab ( ! ! ! ) but he's easily to take then Fairbanks . O'Hara is absolutely gorgeous but she comes across as bad as Fairbanks ! She was so obnoxious - - I kept wondering what anyone saw in her . And then there's Walter Slezak ( who's very good ) playing an Oriental ( ! ! ! ! ) . The dialogue is silly and the plot wanders all over the place . I had my finger down on the fast forward button a LOT during this film . Also there really isn't a lot of action in this film - - it's mostly talk . The only thing that kept me watching was the truly breathtaking Technicolor . The colors are rich and vibrant and the movie looks fantastic . Too bad the script and acting weren't up to the visuals . Kids might like it but there is some extreme ( for the time ) violence - - whippings , caning , arrows - - but never any blood . I can only give this a 5 .
478459	463200	74533	5.0	Saw it quite a while ago . . . but still remember it	An enthusiastic young and talented cast try to put on the first nudie musical with numbers such as " Dacing Dildoes " and a totally incompetent director . I caught this years ago on cable ( early 80s ) . I remember when it came out in 1976 people were shocked that Cindy Williams ( of TV's silly " Laverne & Shirley " sitcom ) would star in an R rated movie . Just in case you're curious she remains fully clothed throughout the entire film . The entire cast is young , healthy , good-looking and out to please . There's plenty of female nudity ( some full frontals ) but , strangely , no male nudity ( from the waist down at least ) . There's a constant air of amiability about the film and some of the jokes and songs are pretty good . . . but there are an equal number that are pretty bad . So it was kind of amusing but no blockbuster . The fact that I can still remember scenes and lines from it 20 + years later should tell you something . Good luck finding it - - it seems to have disappeared .
477741	463200	36307	5.0	" Things walkin that ain't got no business walkin "	A somewhat fun Monogram horror movie . The wife of Dr . von Altermann ( John Carradine ) has died mysteriously . Her brother and a hired detective ( hunky Robert Lowery ) investigate . It seems the doctor is quite mad and experimenting on human beings and turning them into zombies . Yes , it's a cheap no budget movie but it's fun . It has a nice atmospheric opening , a few amusing lines , some funny bits by Mantan Moreland and an interesting plot . Also Carradine gives a good performance and Lowery is tall , handsome , muscular and pretty good in a nothing role . A light enjoyable horror flick . Good viewing around Halloween . I give this a 5 .
478382	463200	71524	5.0	Not bad but a disappointment	The second remake of the " Front Page " - - there was a 1931 version , a 1940s version titled " His Girl Friday " AND a 1980s version called " Switching Channels " . The best is " His Girl Friday " but the others aren't bad . In 1920s Chicago Hildy Johnson ( Jack Lemmon ) , a reporter , wants to leave the newspaper business and get married ( to Susan Sarandon ) . His editor Walter Burns ( Walter Matthau ) is dead set against it and will do anything to get Hildy to stay . And then there's the execution of Earl Williams ( Austin Pendleton ) coming up . . . Elaborate , star-studded and very good-looking movie . It did keep me entertained BUT it's a very bad adaptation of " The Front Page " . The original was filled with quick , very funny dialogue to be delivered at lightning speed . This movie " updates " the dialogue ( that means throwing in swearing ) , adds some really crude jokes and throws in unnecessary slapstick sequences . As some other posters have mentioned this movie is VERY loud - - too loud . The cast does what they can - - Matthau is horrible but doesn't destroy the movie ; Lemmon , although too old for the role , is just great ; Sarandon is shamefully wasted ( but she was unknown when she did this ) ; Carol Burnett is ( surprisingly ) not that good as a prostitute ( yes - - you read that right - - Carol Burnett plays a prostitute ) ; Austin Pendleton is letter-perfect as Earl Williams ; Vincent Gardenia explodes and yells ( a lot ) as the sheriff and Harold Gould ( wisely ) underplays the part of the mayor . So this is a good movie but too loud and crude . And it's a real travesty if you compare it to " His Girl Friday " . See it for the cast and the great sets .
479134	463200	55459	5.0	About what you'd expect	An innocent girl , Ann ( Jill Ireland ) is framed by an evil girl , Lucy ( Jocelyn Britton ) and sent to a borstal ( British girls prison ) . There we have an evil prison guard , suicides , cat fights , riots and a strong suggestion of lesbianism . For what it is , it's not bad . It's made in bright , strong colors and has a fairly decent script . Jill Ireland is actually pretty good as Ann , Sheila Whittingham is equally fine as a fellow inmate and Ellen Pollock amusingly chews the scenery as the evil Miss Smith . Also the lesbian suggestions were pretty strong for its time . But I can only give this a 5 . For some reason , they play sleazy music almost constantly in the background . It never matches whats playing on the screen and totally destroys any dramatic impact . Also , you can tell the actors are doing a good job , but the music is really distracting . At some points the music almost drowns out the dialogue ! What's the point of all that ? So , without the music I would probably give it a higher rating but , as it stands , I can only give this a 5 .
478441	463200	117342	5.0	Surprisingly OK	The plot basically has a large wooden puppet coming to life and killing people . . . or is he ? The title is stupid and this was made on no budget , but it was quite interesting . All the acting is good , the story moves quickly and you're kept guessing until the very end about what's going on . The only bad part - - there was a totally unnecessary shower scene just put in to show off female nudity . And there are some BAD special effects . Still , worth catching .
478652	463200	233469	6.0	Typical	Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a fireman ( for no particular reason that I could see ) , whose wife and kid are accidentally killed in a Colombian terrorist attack . 10 minutes later he's in Columbia searching for the terrorist . Typical Arnie film but very fast-moving with tons of fights , explosions , gun play , really implausible situations and loads on violence . But it's hard to watch a Hollywood film about terrorists after the Sept 11 tragedy . In fact , it's downright uncomfortable . All in all it's OK but very familar and really silly . There was a good twist at the end though . One thing - - Arnie is 55 and looks it . Isn't he getting a little too old to be doing this ? In some shots he looks terrible !
478689	463200	52427	6.0	Kids might like it	Story about Tom Thumb ( Russ Tamblyn ) who is no bigger than someone's thumb . He gets involved with two bumbling crooks ( Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers ) and such . Kids might like it but this is pretty hard going . Basically this is more of a musical than anything else . The songs are ( to be nice ) unmemorable and annoying . It got to the point that I was dreading each song - - and there are LOTS of them ! The story ( what there is of it ) is very slight and the lapses in logic were puzzling even for a fairy tale movie . Terry-Thomas ( chewing the scenery ) and Peter Sellers were stupid and unfunny and Alan Young and June Thorburn were unbelievably bland as young lovers . On the plus side Tamblyn was good in the title role , the dances are colorful and there's some really cool stop motion animation with Tom's toys . So kids will probably like this ( although they might howl at the stop motion animation which looks clumsy next to CGI ) but I was bored silly and couldn't wait for this to be over . I give it a 6 .
477339	463200	338459	6.0	Not as good as the first . . .	. . . I never saw the second , but this was OK . The story is kind of confusing . Juni Cortez ( Daryl Sabara ) has to enter a video games designed by the Toymaker ( Sylvester Stallone ! ! ! ) to save his sister Carmen ( Alexa Vega ) and aided by his grandfather ( Ricardo Montalban ) . And the game , if activated , will control all the minds of the children playing them . I didn't like the movie at first . The plot was vague , the jokes silly and when Juni enters the game no rules are given . Very annoying . . . and I never liked video games anyways . But eventually the story clears up , the special effects are impressive and ( best of all ) the whole trip inside the game ( 95 % of the movie ) is in 3-D ! I've always loved wearing those glasses and having things thrown at you . The effects didn't always work ( sometimes I saw double images instead of 3-D ) but when it did work it was great ! And I didn't have one of those 3-D headaches afterwards ! The acting was just OK - - this movie was basically made to show off the special effects . And top-billed Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino have maybe 10 minutes screen time combined - - although Banderas is clearly having a FUN time ! Montalban is just great as the kids grandfather but Stallone is disappointing as the main villain . He tries but he was never good at doing comedy . So I'm giving it a 6 mostly for the special effects and the 3-D . Forget what little there is of a story . Also stay seated for some funny outtakes right after the 3-D closing credits .
478948	463200	67341	6.0	Subtle horror - - but it doesn't really work	Jessica ( Zohra Lampert ) has just been released from a mental institution . She , her husband and a best friend buy a house in a secluded Connecticut town so she can recuperate . They also meet Emily and ( inexplicbaly ) invite her to stay with them . Things are OK at first but slowly unravel - - Jessica starts hearing voices ; she sees dead bodies and a mysterious girl in white and something in the lake tries to pull her under when she goes swimming . Is something going on . . . or is she loosing her mind again ? Despite the title this is a quiet moody little horror film . It has a lot of good moments but never pulls together . There are too many unexplained things - - especially who IS the mute girl in white ? Also the ending doesn't make a lot of sense . Some clumsy dialogue doesn't help and Lampert's performance goes all over the place . She has said she didn't like doing this movie - - and it shows . The film does have some things going for it . There lots of eerie noises ( a constantly blowing wind especially ) and spooky music on the soundtrack that works . There are some moments of quiet horror that work - - especially when Emily walks out of the lake . Also the DVD release looks incredible - - the colors are rich and sound loud . Still this is a quiet little horror film that just doesn't work . With a better lead actress and a clearer storyline this might have really been great . Worth a look if you're a horror fan . I give it a 6 .
477569	463200	366548	6.0	I'm not sure how I feel about this	Two penguins Norma Jean ( voiced by Nicole Kidman ) and Dallas ( Hugh Jackman ) give birth to a baby called Mumble ( Elijah Wood ) . According to this movie the penguins sing constantly ( from 1950s to present day music ) but Mumbles can't sing . . . but he CAN dance . However the tribal elders said his singing is evil and the reason their fish supply is dwindling , and he is banished . I could go on but basically you've seen this before . . . only with human beings . It's another story telling children that it's OK to be different and this one has an environmental message with it . There's nothing wrong with that ( the kids in my audience were dead silent and seemed to love this ) but I was unimpressed . The CGI was incredible , the songs were good and the voices matched the characters completely . . . but I didn't know how to take this movie . I mean when a bunch of penguin kids started singing " In My Room " by the Beach Boys i didn't know how to respond . It wasn't funny , it wasn't cute , it was just . . . weird . SPOILERS AHEAD ! ! ! There are also sequences where the penguins are attacked by other animals which might disturb real young kids . And Mumbles ends up in a zoo towards the end . . . and begins to go crazy . THAT'S for kids ? ? ? ? I found it disturbing and I'm an adult ! END OF SPOILERS ! ! ! ! It does all end on a very happy but totally unbelievable note - - even for a kids movie that end was pushing it . So I ( sort of ) liked it but it all left me kind of cold ( no pun intended ) and the movie slams you in the face with its message again and again . When you see a whole colony of penguins break-dancing and it's not funny ( my audience was dead silent ) something is wrong . The only real humor here was a bunch of penguins ( with Spanish accents ) which befriend Mumbles - - they were absolutely hysterical . So kids will probably love this but adults should use caution . Some adult couples walked out of this when I saw it ! I can only give it a 6 - - but put that rating higher if you're seeing it with kids .
478253	463200	120841	6.0	For WHAT it is - - it's OK	This movie begins with a REALLY stupid premise : they recreate the SIL from the first film ( who killed many people and is still played by Herstridge ) and they try to figure out a way to kill her in case creatures like her invade Earth ! ( ! ! ! ? ? ? ) Meanwhile a manned mission to Mars returns to Earth unknowingly infected with an alien virus which produces a MALE version of SIL ( Justin Lazard ) . Like the first he has to mate with women who get pregnant immediately and the babies FORCE their way out . Now this IS a stupid movie - - no two ways about it . The plot is dumb full of plot loopholes , the dialogue is howlingly stupid ( I THINK some of the lines were meant as jokes ) , it's VERY gory and contains a large amount of female nudity ( naturally Lazard is never shown completely nude ) . BUT , as a stupid B movie , it does work . I was truthfully never bored . It's only 90 minutes and DOES move quickly . Also the special effects aren't bad . . . but not as good as the first . The acting , like in the first one , varies . Herstridge is actually not bad - - she was terrible in the first one . Michael Madsen walks through his role . Marg Helgenberger was surprisingly good ( considering she has the worst dialogue ) . James Cromwell is excellent as a slimy senator . As the main SIL here Lazard tries - - but he's given nothing to work with . He is a very handsome man with a very nice body but can't do anything with his character . And it has a silly ending which sets up Species III ( which never happened because this one bombed ) . There is one very disturbing aspect of this picture - - there are MANY views of nude women torn open and dead as their babies come out . We get the idea with the first one but they keep constantly showing other victims . It's unpleasant and sick . . . it gives the film a very sick edge . Because of that I can only give this a 6 . Again - - this is NOT a good movie but a very good / bad one .
477331	463200	73802	7.0	Dated but somewhat worthwhile	Robert Redford plays a reference assistant for the CIA in New York . While he's out getting lunch the entire staff are brutally shot to death . He comes back , discovers the bodies , calls the CIA . . . and soon discovers that they want him dead too . He has nowhere to turn to and the CIA after him . . . The technology in this film is laughably dated ( the dial phones and the computer search made me giggle ) but , that aside , this is reasonably entertaining . It's extremely well shot - - NYC looks just great . There's also some good acting - - Faye Dunaway is just great as a woman Redford kidnaps ; Max von Sydow is very good ( and scary ) as a killer ; Cliff Robertson is just so-so as a CIA head and John Houseman is very commanding in his small role . I was entertained for 2 hours , but I can only give it a 7 . The problems : the film was too long ; Robert Redford gives another lousy performance ; the dialogue is occasionally very bad ( especially in the scenes between Redford and Dunaway ) and there's a very silly , needless romance and sex scene between Dunaway and Redford . Still , the film has its moments and might have had more with a better leading man . The R rating on this film should be lowered to a PG-13 . By todays standards the violence is pretty tame and there's only fairly mild swearing .
479441	463200	65143	7.0	Very good , especially for Argento fans	A writer notices a woman being attacked and tries to save her . She survives . . . but now the killer is after him . A very early Argento film ( I believe his first ) shows all the trademarks that he perfected in his later films - - shots from the killers POV ; the killer being in a black trenchcoat ; the stalking sequences ; the eye looking through the hole in the door ; the killings ; the great use of wide screen . The only thing missing is graphic gore ( the film is PG ) . . . there are murders but they're pretty tame . The story is fairly interesting with huge gaps in logic ( an Argento trademark ) and has some very good , suspenseful moments . The dubbing does detract and the acting is pretty bad , but Argento keeps things moving quickly and some of his direction is astounding . Worth seeing . If you're an Argento fan ( like me ) this is a must-see . Also , it has the be seen in a theatre or letter-boxed . . . that's the only way it would work .
477470	463200	337921	7.0	No masterpiece but lots of fun !	Jessica Martin ( Kim Basinger ) is kidnapped from her house . They lock her in a dark , dusty attic - - it seems her husband did something and they need the information from her . All that's in the attic is a busted up phone . She frantically keeps connecting wires until she gets somebody's phone to ring . It's the cell phone of Ryan ( Chris Evans ) a 20 something guy . He agrees to help her get the kidnappers while keeping her on the line . The plot sounds kind of lame but it actually works . The movie has tons of twists and turns and almost never stops moving . Basinger is ( surprisingly ) very good . William H . Macy has a few good moments too as a cop and Jason Statham is downright horrifying as one of the main bad guys . But this is Evans ' movie all the way . He's very handsome and in great shape ( he's introduced with his shirt off to show his great body - - woof ! ) . He is also a very good actor and is convincing throughout the film . My only complaints are minor - - the story DOES have its dead spots and the villains are TOO violent - - Basinger is beaten up a LOT and it looks all too realistic . Still this is 99 % better than most of the crap churned out by Hollywood . So far this is the best Hollywood thriller of 2004 . Worth catching - - especially for gorgeous Evans .
477934	463200	39017	7.0	Pretty good	Sherlock Holmes ( Basil Rathbone ) and Dr . Watson ( Nigel Bruce ) are hired by Roland Carstairs to travel with him and his mother on a train from England to Edinburgh . His mother is in possession of the Star of Rhodesia - - an expensive and beautiful diamond - - and Roland wants to make sure Holmes is there to protect it . In short order Roland is murdered and the Star is stolen . Holmes has to figure out who on the railway car killed him and stole the diamond . One of the better Holmes & Watson movies done for Universal . It moves VERY quick ( it runs under an hour ) and has a very ingenious plot . To be honest I had guessed who had done it before it was revealed - - but I still didn't know why . Rathbone is excellent as Holmes and Bruce unfortunately plays Watson as an idiot - - BUT he surprisingly does help quite a bit in getting the killer at the end . The acting is pretty good by everybody else if a little broad ( we're to suspect all of them so they ALL act suspicious ) . Unfortunately we get the incredibly annoying Inspector Lestrade ( Dennis Hoey ) in this too . He's an even bigger idiot than Watson and his " comic " relief is downright painful . Still a fast-moving pretty good murder mystery . Perfect late-night viewing .
479146	463200	118275	7.0	Not great but I liked it	A pretty good cop show by Steven Bochco . It got a lot of controversy at the time because the pilot show had ( for TV ) a pretty graphic scene where a man gets shot in the head . It started out with fairly good ratings but slowly sank till it was canceled . It was was no masterpiece but people kept comparing it to " NYPD Blue " which was a better show - - there was no way they could compete . Still it was well-acted and written - - I especially liked Jon Tenney as one of the main characters . Towards the end ( in a desperate attempt to get higher ratings ) they had an episode where Tenney showed his butt and publicized it a LOT . Unfortunately it didn't save the show . So , a pretty good show that deserved a better chance .
478117	463200	74021	7.0	Ahead of its time	A satire on soap operas dealing with a VERY strange housewife named Mary Hartman ( Louise Lasser ) and her heavily dysfunctional family and friends . It dealt with homosexuality , alcoholism , wife beating , drug abuse , rape , murder ALL done with a comic twist . Most TV shows wouldn't touch those subjects - - but this one did . This was considered very strong material for its time . It usually played during the afternoon hours but parents were horrified that their children were being subjected to this . Personally I was 14 when it started - - I just found it funny and not even remotely shocking . It was moved to late night ( 11 : 30 ) in most areas on the country . It had a successful run for a few years until creator Norman Lear decided to end it . There was a final episode that tied together all the loose ends . In terms of subject matter this was extreme . . . but its also very much of its time . The show didn't get too controversial ( two gay characters were only allowed to talk to each other - - no kissing or hugging ) and the off the wall humor kept giving the show a light touch . So it was ahead of its time - - but today it comes across as pretty slow and dated . The humor seems pretty silly now and the subject matter isn't even remotely extreme anymore . TV Land tried to revive it a few years ago and it didn't work . So - - it did help push the boundaries of what could be shown and talked about on TV but , unfortunately , it doesn't age well .
478270	463200	113026	7.0	Good , could have been great	It's a mystery to me why this film sat on the shelf for 5 years . It's no masterpiece , but it's colorful and entertaining . The songs are beautiful and well performed by ALMOST the entire cast . The story is interesting but gets confusing at the half-way point - - I'm assuming it's because of the 15 minutes cut out of the original print . Unfortunately there's one huge problem with the movie - - Joey McIntyre . He can sing OK , but sounds bad compared to everyone else . And his acting is horrendous ! At one point he's trying to be romantic with his girlfriend on a porch bench - - he was so bad the audience I had was in hysterics by the end of the scene . Also , he's not good-looking at all ( sorry ! ) and just unbelievable . Without him this might have been a great musical . Sadly , it just misses the mark . Still worth seeing though .
478819	463200	963794	7.0	Good but not great	A bunch of college kids ( Jonathan Tucker , Jena Malone , Shawn Ashmore and Laura Ramsey ) are on vacation in Mexico . They meet a friendly German man ( Joe Anderson ) who offers to take them to a Mayan temple that nobody else knows about . They go . . . but soon find themselves in terrible danger . SPOILER ! ! ! The vines covering the temple are alive - - and eat people ! ! ! END SPOILER This is about 70 % better than most of the horror films we've been getting . It has characters we know and care about ; it doesn't have any of those stupid ' jump ' scares that every horror film today seems to have ; it has next to no nudity ( only very briefly ) and it doesn't rub gore in our faces . This movie has only two really gory scenes - - and more is heard than seen . That , of course , makes it even harder to watch . I was literally cringing in my seat during these scene and it takes a LOT to get to me ! With the sole exception of Tucker ( he was WAY too calm ) the acting is very good , the script has people reacting exactly how people might react in this situation and it's very well-directed . My only complaints are that this movie is a good one hour movie stretched out to 90 minutes . Sometimes it does get a little dull . Also it's never explained exactly WHY the vines are doing that . And how about those people who won't let them leave the temple ? Why did they let them get there in the first place ? So these questions kept nagging me and somewhat lessen the film . Still this is a good strong horror film . I give it a 7 .
479103	463200	96223	7.0	Has its moments but needed more	Ivan Alexeev ( John Cusack ) and Josh Tager ( Tim Robbins ) try to break into the L . A . music scene in the late 1980s . Quirky Samantha Gregory ( Mary Crosby ) tries to help . I caught this back in the late 1980s at a small art house . The audience loved it and it was held over for a few weeks . Back then I thought it was just great . Seeing it now , 20 years later , its charms have faded . It is very energetic and Cusack , Robbins and Crosby are just great . There's also a large cast of character actors in small roles that help . The commercial parodies and music videos are funny and inventive . BUT the film gets repetitious real quick - - the same jokes are made over and over . It's also very dated ( you have to laugh when a character says " Video is the future " ) , has plenty of bad jokes and some real mediocre songs . Still this has enough good moments to give it a 7 and the closing song / video during the closing credits is lots of fun ! Ex MTV DJ Martha Quinn appears as a - - music TV DJ ! This might work better with an audience .
477389	463200	70078	7.0	Minor but fun	Four stories revolving around a shop named Temptations Limited . It's run by Peter Cushing so you know there's something evil going around . People buy ( or steal ) items from it and meet horrible fates . The first involves a customer buying an old mirror . It seems it has an evil spirit in it that orders him to kill . It's pretty bloody for a PG film . The second has a man unhappily married who meets a strange beggar and his equally strange daughter . They promise to help him . . but are they ? The third is mostly comedy when a man has an " elemental " on him and has to get it removed . The last has a man buying a door from the shop that leads to an evil room . . . and man . I caught this when I was 12 or 13 at the theatre . I liked it . No great shakes but pretty well done . Seeing it again I still feel the same way . No great shakes but OK . The stories are pretty good with cool twist endings and they have a cast of talented British actors who are all having fun with their roles ( especially Margaret Leighton ) . Also it's always good to see Cushing in anything and he makes the most of his small role . Easily one of the better horror anthology movies . No unsung classic but fun .
479225	463200	65669	7.0	Psychedelic horror	Nancy Wagner ( Sandra Dee in her last movie role ) is a librarian at the Miskatonic Univ where the only copy of the Necronomicon ( an evil book ) is kept . Sinister Wilbur Whatley ( a young Dean Stockwell in a hideous mustache and hair do ) uses her to get access to the book . He then invites her to his house in Arkham . He gets her there and drugs her to make her stay . . . he has plans for her ! Also there's someTHING in the attic banging at the locked door . Two of Nancy's friends come to get her and all hell breaks loose ! First off , this is NOT a faithful adaptation of H . P . Lovecraft's story ( I should know - - I just read it a few weeks ago ) . Some scenes are taken from it but the script is very different from the source . That said it's not a bad film . It's elaborately done ( beautiful settings , eerie sounds and rich deep color ) and is mildly engrossing . Unfortunately it's far from perfect . The script is OK but there are far too many plot holes ( for instance , Dee tells Stockwell she can't stay the weekend . . . in the very next scene she's saying she is ! ) . Also the acting is really bad by the two leads - - Dee seems uneasy and unsure of how to play her part ; Stockwell ( who is a great actor ) is , surprisingly , terrible ! He acts like he's stoned half the time ( maybe he was ) and is just horrible . There are scenes of a monster stalking about ( hey , it's an AIP film ! ) and attacking which are very psychedelic ( lots of flashing lights , negative film , different colors , loud sounds ) and quite effective . Look for Talia Coppola ( later Shire ) as one of the victims . However , there's no graphic gore or blood . Also , a real cool ending . Also , there's an odd somewhat homophobic line in this - - a friend of Dee comments on her staying with Stockwell - - " If he were straight , I wouldn't be worried . " ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Is that supposed to be funny ? It's pretty stupid and offensive today . All in all , an OK film . It's been reissued in VHS and DVD in a beautiful new print with great color and sound . Try to see it that way - - it really helps the film .
478454	463200	435653	7.0	An actually very good horror flick	SPOILERS After the funeral of a man three of his buddies - - Harris ( Dominic Purcell ) , Kira ( Josie Maren ) and Sid ( Marcus Thomas ) - - get drunk and dance on some graves in a graveyard late at night . It turns out they unwittingly resurrected some evil ghosts who go after the people who disturbed them . This was barely released back in 2006 but it actually isn't half bad . The bad points are : the movie has those stupid jump scares ; some of the acting is pretty bad ; it has a totally pointless beginning ( which the director rightly protested ) and a frustrating ending . The good : there are likable characters ; there's some good acting ; the story sounds far-fetched but they put it across and it has some VERY scary moments . The ghosts aren't actually even seen till the end and believe me - - they are frightening ! There are three horrific standouts here : the first view of the ghost in Harris ' bed , a sequence in a graveyard halfway through and the all out assault at the end . The special effects are excellent and it truly scared me - - there aren't many films I can say that about ! Some bad acting by Purcell ( who can be good ) lessens the full effect but everybody else is pretty good ( especially Clare Kramer as Harris ' wife ) . So a good strong ghost movie . Turn off all the lights and pop this into the DVD player ! I give it a 7 .
478659	463200	245674	7.0	Better than the original	The original 1960 " 13 Ghosts " was a very boring , stupid horror film . This one , while no classic , is actually quite good . A grieving widower Arthur ( Tony Shalhoub ) , his hot daughter ( Shannon Elizabeth ) , annoying son ( Alec Roberts ) and feisty black maid / cook / babysitter / whatever ( Rah Digga ) get trapped in an all glass house with a sort of psychic ( Matthew Lilliard ) and a ghost liberator ( Embeth Davidtz ) . It was set up by the evil Cyrus ( F . Murray Abraham ) and he has 12 murderous ghosts in cages down in the basement . But they all get out , one by one , and go after the family . This is pretty dull stuff until they get locked in the house , the ghosts escape . . . then the movie REALLY gets going . The ghosts are very brutal-looking and their attacks are bloody and violent . In a nice tip of the hat to the original , people in the movie can only see the ghosts when they have special glasses on . The special effects are excellent and it has more than a few scary scenes . The plot does go out the window at the end , but I was still interested . The acting - - Shalhoub is OK as the father . Davidtz is in it for the money ( and her character is badly written ) . Lilliard goes way over the top . . . as always ( take a few Valium bud ) . . . seriously , can't this guy do anything but overact ? Elizabeth is full of life and is viciously attacked in one scene but she's not in the movie enough . Roberts is just annoying as the kid . And F . Murray . . . he can play this villain role in his sleep . . . and he does . And Digga is funny but her character is cliché city . No masterpiece but not the disaster I was expecting . Worth seeing in a theatre with a good sound system .
478837	463200	47573	7.0	OK , some of the ants look fake , but . . .	the movie works . It's about a colony of giant ants ( caused by nuclear radiation ) on the rampage . The story moves VERY quickly , has decent acting and characterizations and some of the special effects are very good . But when they look bad , they look BAD ! ! ! But hey . . . it was done in the 1950s ! This is easily the best " big bug " movie of the 50s . Well worth catching .
479066	463200	64100	7.0	VERY 60s but not uninteresting	Robert Culp and Natalie Wood play a VERY liberated couple who basically love each other . . . when they cheat on the other they discuss it and talk out their feelings and end up still madly in love . They share their views with another couple played by Dyan Cannon and Elliott Gould . They try to convert them to their way of thinking . . . but will it work or tear them all apart ? For starters this film would NOT be made today . With HIV and AIDS out there the casual sex shown here is a stupid idea . And can anyone seriously say they would honestly tell their partners that they had cheated on them and DISCUSS it ? ? ? ? That aside , I still sort of like the movie . The script was well-written with some sharp observations on sex and love and I found the discussions between Culp and Wood fascinating . Also Culp and Wood give out great performances ( I especially liked Wood's little smiles ) . Cannon is good too but , surprisingly , looks HORRIBLE . Gould is just OK . But the script carries this one . If you can accept the ideas in this it works . However it all ends in a laughably horrible ending that ( almost ) destroys everything that went before . Ending aside , I think this is a pretty interesting and a ( I think ) accurate picture of the late 1960s . Worth a look . I give it a 7 .
478032	463200	408236	7.0	It's OK	Film version of the play . Based on fact it tells the story of a man ( Johnny Depp ) who is jailed ( for no good reason ) for 15 years . It was done by slimy Judge Turpin ( Alan Rickman ) because he wanted his wife and child . 15 years later he returns , adopts the name Sweeney Todd and sets out for vengeance . He's helped by Nellie Lovett ( Helena Bonham Carter ) who uses the meat from his victims to put into her meat pies which become VERY popular . I saw the play back in 1980 with Angela Landsbury and George Hearn . I remember loving it and the acting was superb . This version just doesn't match up - - it can't ! Tim Burton correctly shoots it in seriously drained color and he gets a superb performance by Depp and young Ed Sanders ( as Toby ) . Everybody can sing too . Also the murders are shown with blood gushing out - - once onto the camera lens ! Still it's impossible to take them seriously . Still this has its drawbacks . Carter is terrible - - she can sing but her acting is pretty dreadful . Rickman has done the evil act once too often - - and it shows . Also it's depressing ! It wears you down running on for two full hours . Some songs were cut out too - - I really miss " The Ballad of Sweeney Todd " . So - - it's not a disaster but it could have been so much better with a different leading lady and not cutting ANY of the songs . Depp really puts this film across though - - for him alone I give this a 7 .
479335	463200	187696	7.0	Bad dubbing hurts but I liked it	I saw ( unfortunately ) the dubbed version on Encore . Student Paula Henning ( Franka Potente who was also in the cult favorite " Run Lola Run " ) stars as a serious medical student who gets into a prestigious school in Germany . But she soon discovers that some students go missing and the bodies they work on in the anatomy lab are incredibly fresh . . . I was stuck seeing the dubbed version on Encore . It hurt a lot ( the words not matching the lips got annoying real quick ) but I still liked what I saw . The acting was good , it was beautifully photographed , it wasn't TOO gruesome and I was never bored . Even more refreshing was a likable heroine who fights back when the bad guys go after her . The ( mild ) nudity was , in a refreshing twist , male ! A previous poster mentions Benno Furmann ( who is excellent ) showed his butt but I don't remember seeing it . Regardless this is a well done , scary and excellent thriller . From all I've read the original German language version is the best ( I don't doubt that for one second ) but the dubbed version is watchable . I give this a 7 .
479027	463200	66249	8.0	Strange but enjoyable	Sherlock Holmes ( Robert Stephens ) and Dr . Watson ( Colin Blakely ) get involved in a very weird case involving a mysterious French woman ( Geneuieve Page ) , Sherlock's brother Mycroft ( Christopher Lee ) , midgets , Scotland , the Queen and the Loch Ness Monster ! Believe it or not they all come together . I originally saw this on TV back in the late 70s but it was so heavily edited ( for instance , the entire first half hour was gone ! Probably because it dealt with gay characters which was still a taboo on TV back then ) that I couldn't follow it and gave up . Now it's back on uncut and I'm glad I'm finally able to see it . A very strange movie but lots of fun . Some people think this is a spoof . It really isn't but there are some very funny moments - - my favorite is at the beginning when Holmes blasts Watson for how he writes about his cases - - " Watson , I've never said ' elementary my dear Watson ' in my life ! " " Poetic license Holmes " . There's also quite a few funny one liners mostly delivered with great relish by Stephens and it does deal with the sexual relations of Holmes and Watson ( it was hinted that they were gay lovers ) . But it does involve a very serious case and the jokes stop towards the end . Stephens is actually very good as Holmes - - he won't make you forget Basil Rathbone but he's not bad . Colin Blakely isn't as big a buffoon as Nigel Bruce was but he tends to overact a little . Page is just terrible as the mystery woman - - but then again , English is her second language . Lee , surprisingly , is kind of stiff as Mycroft . He's a very good actor - - I'm surprised to see him so bad . The movie is very lavish ( probably because Billy Wilder was involved ) . . . a lot of money and attention was given to sets and costumes , and they actually went on location to shoot the end in Scotland . The cinematography is just beautiful and the movie was never dull . It doesn't always mix the comedy with the drama successfully but it works more often than it misses . Worth catching . . . a must see for Holmes fans .
477683	463200	87688	8.0	Loved it in 1984 - - still love it	Father Tim Farley ( Jack Lemmon ) is a well loved priest in his church . He is given a month to teach headstrong Mark Dolson ( Zeljko Ivanek ) on how to tone his anger down and become a priest . He finds out Mark had gay sex before he decided to enter the Church . Unfortunately homophobic Monsignor Thomas Burke ( Charles Durning ) finds out too and wants him thrown out . Farley wants to stand up for Mark . . . but can he without getting thrown out himself ? Quite obviously this was a play but it still works . There's nothing great or flashy about the direction but it has a great script and two wonderful performances by Durning and especially Lemmon . I wish I could say the same about Ivanek but he comes across as too angry and stubborn - - it seems reasonable that he shouldn't be a priest . Still the issue about how the Catholic church views homosexuality is dealt with in a intelligent manner . As a lapsed Catholic myself I applaud the film for pointing out how biased and ridiculous their view is . I again have to say how good Lemmon is - - I don't think this man ever gave a bad performance and he's just perfect here . A few of his discussions with Ivanek are ( purposely ) very funny . The ending is sort of muted here . They didn't change it from the play but it doesn't hit as hard - - they didn't want to depress the audience I guess . For whatever reason this was barely released in 1984 . The studio was probably afraid of the Catholic church condemning it but that actually might have made it more popular ! Look at " Hail Mary " or " Last Temptation of Christ " . The very few reviews here show that it's still pretty unknown . That's a shame because it's a well-made and thoughtful comedy drama . Well worth catching . " Mark don't kick a ! " " It's better than kissing it . "
478540	463200	264616	8.0	Disturbing	Kind , widowed Texas dad ( Bill Paxton ) is bringing up his two sons Adam ( Jeremy Sumpter ) and Fenton ( Matthew O'Leary ) - - it's made clear that he loves them both very much . Then , one night , a " vision from God " tells him to kill some demons disguised as people . He follows the orders and drags his two young sons along with him . Fenton starts getting very scared about his dad's sanity . Creepy , scary and absorbing movie is part horror movie , part psychological thriller , part coming of age movie , part religious . . . and it all works beautifully . The direction by Paxton is assured ( hard to believe this is his first directed movie ) and his acting is just flawless - - he's always good but he's great here . Young Matthew O'Leary is another standout - - you really feel his confusion . Also Powers Boothe ( obviously enjoying himself ) is good and Matthew McConaughey plays his usual laid back self and flashes those beautiful blue eyes ( and there is a shirtless scene - - thanks Bill ! ) The story is complex and twists and turns in directions I didn't see coming . The killings are all off screen - - this is NOT a blood and guts movie . Basically it's a very good thriller . Be warned - - there is a very hard to watch sequence with child abuse .
478563	463200	470272	8.0	For gay porno this is groundbreaking	An update of classic novel of the same name . This is set in modern day New York and is an all gay version . For gay porno this is a one of a kind . There's an actual plot and , for porno , the acting isn't half bad . Also what's interesting is that don't use all young hairless guys as most pornos do . These guys range from 20s-30s , some are pretty hairy and they're not all drop dead gorgeous . They do all have buff bodies and the hardcore scenes go on and on and on . That's not a bad thing but this runs 2 hours with ( maybe ) 45 minutes of plot . I actually lost track of what was going on after the sex scenes ended ! Still this is a very good attempt to go a hardcore gay porno with a plot based on a classic novel . The settings are beautiful , there are plenty of cameos and the sex is VERY hot and erotic . This is ( obviously ) not for everyone but gay guys will love it - - it sold out at a gay bookstore I know of . This is already considered a mini-masterpiece of gay porno . Recommended .
479172	463200	104466	8.0	One of Woody Allen's best comedy / dramas	A married couple , Sally ( Judy Davis ) and Jack ( Sydney Pollack ) , tell their best friends - - another married couple named Gabe ( Woody Allen ) and Judy ( Mia Farrow ) - - that they are separating . This news throws Gabe and Judy into a tailspin . It makes them reexamine their own marriage and find it lacking . Meanwhile Sally starts seeing a handsome , romantic man ( Liam Neeson ) and Jack is living with a girl at least 30 years his junior . This film follows what happens to them over the course of a year . A fascinating film . I'm not married ( or even straight ) but I don't think that matters - - this is about love , sex and relationships and has dialogue and situations that anyone can relate to . Allen's script is right on target - - the insights are just incredible , and we slowly begin to see exactly how all of the four main characters really are . During the film they are all interviewed by a never seen person - - these interviews really help the story and reveals how everybody feels about the others . It pulls everything together . The acting is almost all great . Allen and Farrow were living together when this was filmed - - when it was released they were in a bitter custody battle . This movie actually provides insight to WHY they broke up - - their argument scenes are just a bit too realistic . Davis and Pollack are just superb in their roles . They let you feel their characters pain and confusion - - just great acting . Neeseon isn't asked to do much but he is very affecting in his scenes . However Juliette Lewis is terrible as a college student . Her voice is nasal and whiny and her acting is pretty lousy - - but it doesn't ruin the film . I saw this back in 1992 in a theatre and loved it . Twelve years later I STILL love it . A great film . I'm only giving this an 8 though . There are two big faults with this film : the hand-held jittery camera work being the main one . My guess is Allen filmed it this way to make the film more immediate and give it a documentary feel . It works but it IS distracting . Also it gets a little repetitious towards the end . Still this is well worth seeing . Recommended .
479534	463200	382073	8.0	Nothing new but well done	Diana ( Glenn Close ) is a drama teacher who daughter Isabel ( Elizabeth Banks is getting married . She's going to marry Jonathan ( James Marsden ) but she's not sure if it's what she should do . Her ex Mark ( Matt Davis ) offers her a job that might be a way out . Actor Alec ( Jesse Bradford ) auditions for Diana and she becomes attracted to him . And photographer Benjamin Moore is having a show . . . and all hell will break loose . Got all that ? Multi-character drama seriously offers nothing new plot-wise but it's well-written and acted by a great cast . Close leads the way and is superb followed closely by Banks . Even Marsden , Bradford and Davis are good - - and I've never really liked any of them . Well-directed with good use of Rufus Wainwright music . There's also a very passionate gay kiss . But seriously . . . I've seen this all before . These plots have been done in other movies . Still it's worth catching for the acting alone . Recommended .
478841	463200	179626	8.0	Very exciting but unbelievable and sadistic	Two foreigners ( one Russian , the other Czech ) go to America and decide to get rich by videotaping themselves murdering people , sell it to a sleazy TV tabloid host ( wonderfully played by Kelsey Garmmer ) , get off by pleading insanity and then sell their story to the highest bidder . Obviously , the plot is ridiculous . Also it decries violence but shoves scenes of extreme blood and violence in our face - - one sadistic sequences shows a topless hooker being beaten and stabbed the death . Also we get more than a few shots of her nude , bloody body afterwords . Yet , if you ignore the loopholes ( and there are many ) in the plot and brace yourself for the violence , the film works . It's virtually nonstop action , violence , noise going at you full blast . The acting - - well , who cares ? This movie is not an acting movie . DeNiro walks through his role as a celebrity cop and Edward Burns looks very handsome but utterly miserable all through the film . Also the two psychos tend to overdo it too much . And the constant switching between video and film stock gets tiresome real quick . But if it's a loud , noisy , stupid , fun ( in a way ) action film you're looking for . . . this is it !
477817	463200	60479	8.0	Took me a while to get into it . . . but I did	Glossy soap opera about 8 Vassar graduates of 1933 . It follows their lives after college and deals with alcoholism , mental breakdowns , frigidity , beatings , adultery , child rearing , lesbianism and death . I tried reading the book this was based on but I couldn't understand it . They kept throwing in 1930s slang and politics and lost me . This movie keeps out the slang , tones down the politics ( but it is there ) and came up with a good movie . Yes , it is a soap opera but well made with some great actresses and it deals with it's subjects seriously . Some of the story lines involve : Polly ( Shirley Knight ) falling in love with a married doctor ( Hal Holbrook ) ; Kay ( Joanna Pettet ) dealing with an alcoholic husband ( Larry Hagman ) ; Dottie ( Joan Heckett ) falling in love with a womanizer ( Richard Mulligan ) and Priss ( Elizabeth Hartman ) dealing with raising a child . It's fascinating to see these actors so young and full of life . All the acting is good but Hartman and Knight stand out . Also Candace Bergman shows up at the beginning and the end as a lesbian - - quite daring for 1966 . The surprise is that she's dealt with in a very sensitive manner and not made evil . This movie is long ( 150 minutes ) and its cast is very big ( it took me at least an hour to figure out who was who ) but I ended up enjoying this and recommend it . I give it an 8 .
478606	463200	39923	8.0	Oscar-winning cartoon	The first pairing of Tweety Bird and Sylvester was also an Oscar winner . Quick , violent and absolutely hilarious . And every time I hear Tweety say " I tawt I taw a puddy tat " I break up . Well worth catching . Also the print I saw had bright , vivid color . TCM usually shows this around Oscar time - - look for it !
479112	463200	210616	8.0	Cliché city , but I LOVED it !	Let's see - - you've got a bunch of young hopefuls in a tough ballet school in NYyou have the tough , but lovable , black girl ; the token gay man ; the sweet virginal heroine ; the arrogant Russian guy ; the sweet lovable guy who's perfect for the sweet heroine , but she doesn't know it ; the b who's starving herself to death ; the guy who loves her and wants to help her ; the tyrannical ( but lovable ) ballet teachers - - yep , they're all here ! The script is utterly predictable , you know how it's going to end 10 minutes into the movie , but I loved it ! The acting is surprisingly good , it's beautifully filmed , the whole cast is attractive and the dancing is simply superb . I wasn't bored once during the entire 2 hours . Well worth seeing .
477853	463200	74633	8.0	Fun for film buffs . . .	but probably nobody else . A young , beautiful woman ( Candice Rialson ) comes to Hollywood to become a star . She starts working with Miracle Pictures ( " If it's a good picture , it's a miracle " ) as a stunt girl . Miracle makes nothing but ultra cheap t & a movies . There's the star director ( Parl Bartel ) who supposedly thinks he's making art and an arrogant diva ( Mary Woronov ) who wants all the film to herself . Then woman are being killed on the set . Who's doing it . . . and why ? Film was actually shot in 10 days with directors Joe Dante and Allan Arkush using tons of footage from previous Roger Corman movies . The movie never takes itself too seriously and does have some VERY funny lines . But the plot is way too feeble even at 83 minutes ( there's LOTS of padding ) ; the acting is pretty bad ( except for Bartel , Woronov and Dick Miller - - all having a GREAT time ) ; there is an unnecessary ( and stupid ) wet T-shirt sequence ; there's a very sick rape scene played for laughs ( and repeated twice ) ; a very brutal knife slashing and plot holes galore ( why DOES that guy at the end have all that stuff about victims in his little shed ? ) . What kept me watching is the tons of funny little injokes for movie fans . They're way too numerous to mention but they are there . Also it was just released in a 25th anniversary edition and looks just great . Most casual viewers will probably find this dull , stupid and sick - - they're right , but it is fun for film fans . Don't miss the jokes during the closing credits and one right after them .
478648	463200	82533	8.0	An almost classic	TV newswoman Karen White ( Dee Wallace ) is traumatized by a meeting with a psycho killer in a porno shop . A pompous doctor , George Waggner ( Patrick Macnee ! ) , invites her to " The Colony " - - a woodland clinic of his to help her get over the shock . Karen and her husband Bill ( Christopher Stone ) go . . . unaware that there are wolves roaming around . . . This is a full throttle horror-comedy with an emphasis on the comedy . It's almost as good as " American Werewolf in London " . It's fun , has sharp dialogue and constant wolf references ( a copy of the book " Howl " is seen on a desk ; people watch " The Big Bad Wolf " and " The Wolf Man " on TV ) . Also The Colony itself is just gorgeous and beautifully atmospheric . In the day it's clear and bright - - at night the fog rolls in and it becomes really creepy . Also it playfully injects horror clichés in the movie ( I got a big kick out of the sequence in which Karen and a friend get lost in the woods , their flashlight goes out and there's howling in the distance . . . ) . It's ALMOST a classic . The problems are many , but the main one is that the film isn't scary - - when you see the werewolves they look pretty pathetic . This is supposed to be ( partially ) a HORROR film - - it doesn't help when the main monsters look silly . The transformation scenes look lousy too - - but this was over 20 years ago . The story is sort of vague ( why does Dr . Waggner invite her to the colony in the first place ? It puts her in danger ! ) and there are plenty of dead spots . It seems too long and it's only 90 minutes ! Also Wallace and Stone are not good actors - - Wallace's reaction to finding a dead , bloody body is very poor and Stone sleepwalks through his role ( although he does very well at a campfire sequence - - you'll know it when you see it ) . So , it has great atmosphere , some very good laughs , John Carradine and some very good cameos ( Dick Miller , Roger Corman and Forrest J . Ackerman holding a copy of his magazine " Famous Monsters of Filmland " ) but it's VERY light and insubstantial - - you want to see a real movie after this . Nevertheless , it's worth seeing but not the classic it could have been .
479288	463200	82801	8.0	Odd doesn't begin to describe this one	Earl ( John Belushi ) and Enid ( Kathryn Walker ) are a middle-aged couple who have a boring existence in a big house in the middle of nowhere . Then Vic ( Dan Aykroyd ) and Ramona ( Cathy Moriarty ) move in next door . . . and life becomes a nightmare for Vic . This is one strange one . Hard to believe a major studio green lighted this at all . However Belushi and Aykroyd were at the height of their popularity when this came out so they probably were able to do anything they wanted . This is a pitch black comedy AND very surreal at the same time . I wouldn't call it funny ( I think I laughed once ) but you can't stop watching . Logic goes out the window in this movie when Vic and Ramona show up so you're never sure what's going to happen next . It does have a point ( sort of ) but this isn't for a mass audience . It helps that all the actors are just great . Aykroyd and Belushi purportedly switched roles before the film started shooting . . . and it worked beautifully . They were both cast against type and pulled it off . Moriarty is incredibly sexy and one hell of an actress . Walker throws off comic lines left and right and somehow fits right in with Ramona and Vic . Bill Conti's score is incredible . It's a strange one all right but it fits the movie like a glove . This was ( for some stupid reason ) released around Christmas time . People expected to see a typical silly comedy and that's not what they got . Director John Avildsen hated this too - - he complained Belushi and Aykroyd were constantly rewriting the script . Most critics savaged the film ( very few understood it ) and it was a bomb . Sadly it was Belushi's last movie too . This is a very strange comedy but I really love it . Definitely worth catching if you're looking for something offbeat . An 8 .
477958	463200	35899	8.0	Fast-paced , well-done fun	The wolf man Lawrence Talbot ( Lon Chaney Jr . ) is revived ( in a very spooky , atmospheric sequence ) and searches for Dr . Frankenstein to cure him . The doctor is dead , but his creation is still alive . Silly , but it moves quickly and is lots of fun . The film has plenty of plot , beautiful costumes and sets and good special effects . Lon Chaney Jr . is good ( as usual ) as the tormented Talbot , and is ably supported by Maria Ouspenskaya ( as a gypsy - - as always ) , Patrick Knowles ( handsome and a little mad ) and Lionel Atwill ( the mayor ) . The big mistake was casting Bela Lugosi as the monster . He turned down the role back in 1932 - - it must have been very embarrassing to him to take it 10 years later . Also , he's too small for the role ( Chaney is actually taller ! ) and he seems really uncomfortable ( understandably ) . It all ends up with a short climatic fight between the two . Worth catching - - one of the last really good Universal horror flicks .
477428	463200	106273	8.0	Well-meaning , well-made but no impact	All star adaptation of Randy Shilts book on the AIDS epidemic from 1977-1985 . It follows Matthew Modine as a doctor trying to find a cure for it in the face of homophobia and government bureaucracy . It's very well-done , has a great cast ( except for Alan Alda who's really bad ) and does a very good job of adapting a difficult book . . . but it lacks any real power . It's dated ( of course ) and AIDS is no longer the death sentence it was when this movie was made . The movie should be more angry than it is and it concentrates on the doctors , not the victims which distanced me . It also has its dull stretches and is also at least 20 minutes too long . Sincere performances by the entire cast help . Still , it's a groundbreaking movie ( for TV ) . It just should have been better .
478054	463200	265587	8.0	A true one of a kind !	When a movie starts out with a rather catchy title song ( entitled " Beware of the 4-D Witch ) and then promises to " potray ( ing ) for the first time the Astral World in Transetheric Vision " you KNOW you're in for something different . Mostly the whole film is narrated by Cindy ( played by an actress only called " Margo " ) who practices witchcraft . She contacts an ancestor - - a real Salem witch named Abigail . Abigail escorts Cindy through a series of sexual adventures ( pretty mild ) which Cindy loves . But then things get too extreme and Cindy rejects Abigail . To retaliate Abigail goes after Cindy's brother Mark ( who takes over the narration here ) and turns him into a sex vampire ! Basically it has the actor wearing the fakest fangs I've EVER seen ! If it sounds strange you should see it ! The camera is constantly throwing colors and visions at you ( mostly dime store fright masks with glowing eyes ) and the narration is absolutely hysterical . The " acting " wavers between bad and atrocious . There's also plenty of female nudity but the picture is R rated ( which is mysteriously shown to us at least twice ) . Along with bright colors and visions there is also a soundtrack consisting of classical music ( " Night on Bald Mountain " pops up quite a bit ) mixed with rock music . I can't say I liked this . . . but I couldn't stop watching ! It's so over the top and ridiculous you sort of watch in fascination and try to think of what these people thought they were doing . It gets an 8 because it is a true one of a kind . This is one of those rare movie that's so bad it's good !
478753	463200	29030	8.0	Silly but enjoyable	On a remote island Tarangi ( Jon Hall ) marries Marama ( Dorothy Lamour ) . But , while away in Tahiti on a job , he strikes a white man who insults him . He is instantly jailed - - it's forbidden for a native man to strike a white man . Nasty Gov Eugene De Laage ( Raymond Massey ) won't help him . He keeps trying to escape and that keeps extending his prison sentence . Will he ever get out and be reunited with Marama ? This film deals fairly realistically with racism ( it's against it of course ) but this is hardly a message movie . It's a big , silly but enjoyable piece of escapism . It looks great , there's a beautiful score and plenty of attractive shirtless men and women in sarongs . The script is merely serviceable but it does work - - I admit to getting misty-eyed once or twice ! John Ford directed this very well . Jon Hall is very handsome , nicely toned . . . and very bland as the lead . Lamour isn't much better . But their good looks ( and bodies ) make them pleasant to look at . Massey is just OK ; John Carradine is fun as an evil warden ; Thomas Mitchell is good ( and Oscar-nominated ) as a doctor and even Mary Astor has a few good moments . But the climatic hurricane sequence at the end really sells this . It has still impressive special effects and goes on for a good 15 minutes ! No music here - - just the sound of the wind howling and the waters crashing ( this won a well-deserved Oscar for Sound Effects ) . It's worth sitting through the movie for this one part . So not a great movie but a big , fun popcorn movie . If only the leads had been better actors . . . I give it an 8 .
478341	463200	36733	8.0	No curse , no cat people	This is a semi-sequel to the horror hit " Cat People " . A lonely little girl Amy ( Ann Carter ) lives in a fantasy world - - she believes in magic and make-believe . Her parents ( Kent Smith and Jane Randolph from the first film ) don't understand her and she has no friends . Then the ghost of Kent's first wife shows up to become her friend . Famed director Robert Wise's debut sounds strange but it really works . The title is terrible - - this is no horror film but a charming little fantasy about a little girls coming of age . There are a few scary elements ( a retelling of the story of the Headless Horseman ) but nothing that would frighten anyone . This film has definite problems however - - Kents first wife was cursed , killed a man and died horribly - - there's absolutely no reason for her to suddenly appear as a kindly ghost . Heck , Ann isn't even her child ! The acting is pretty bad ( especially by Smith ) , the movie seems forced and the child psychology is extremely dated ( notice how Smith is LYING to Amy at the end to make her feel better ? ) . Still this is sensitively handled , has some truly beautiful , haunting cinematography and is a definite classic OF ITS KIND . Worth catching . . . but could someone PLEASE change that title ? I give it an 8 .
477827	463200	56048	8.0	Overdone but good	Highly fictionalized account of the rise of famous 1940-1950s stripper Gypsy Rose Lee . It concentrates on her domineering mother Rose ( Rosalind Russell ) and how she pushed both of her daughters into show business . One daughter ( played at various stages by both Ann Jillian and Morgan Brittany ! ) runs off so Rose concentrates on Louise ( Natalie Wood ) who becomes a world famous stripper . It's loud , overblown , too long and really takes liberties with Gypsy's real life but I was entertained . I didn't believe it for one second but the songs were great ( especially " Everything's Comin Up Roses " ) , the production numbers are certainly colorful and all the dancing is good ( I was surprised to see Wood doing a good job at one point ) . The singing is mostly good - - except for Russell . Russell herself said she couldn't sing so they mixed her voice with the voice of another singer . It certainly SOUNDS like Russell but it's off tune a few times . By all rights Ethel Merman should have been cast but she wasn't considered a box office draw in 1962 . Everybody else sings great though . There's also a show-stopping dance number by young Paul Wallace ( he plays Tulsa ) halfway through . I do wonder why he never hit it big . The acting is pretty good . Russell is just fantastic . She takes the role and runs with it . It's a crime that she wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award for this . Karl Malden is also excellent as a man who loves Rose . Surprisingly Wood is bad - - very quiet and subdued . Her character is supposed to be shy and quiet for most of the picture but she doesn't come to life even at the end when she's a famous stripper . Supposedly the real Gypsy Rose Lee showed Wood how to move on stage but it looks like Wood is hating every moment of it . But , this is Russell's show all the way and she bulldozes her way through it . It's worth seeing just for her . I give it an 8 . Look for Jack Benny in a short uncredited appearance .
477960	463200	73747	9.0	Well-done , entertaining thriller	Possible spoilers , but you probably already know the ending . Katharine Ross , hubby and kids move from NYC to Stepford - - a picture perfect town where all the women seem to be absorbed in housework . She slowly begins to realize that something is very wrong . . . A huge hit in its day , this film is dated but still holds up . Some people might see the film as anti-female but , really , the men come off very badly . And they are the villains . The acting is good - - Ross ( whatever happened to her ? ) is excellent as is Paula Prentiss as her VERY energetic best friend Bobbi . Also interesting to see Tina Louise ( very good ) , Dee Wallace and Mary Stauart Masterson ( as a little girl - - no dialogue ) in the mid 70s . The film isn't really scary ( mostly because everybody knows the ending ) and a little bit long , but it's still well worth catching . Also , personally , this film had a defining moments for me . I'm gay , and I saw the movie when I was 13 at a theatre . I didn't know I was gay . . . I just knew there was something different about me . When they show Ross ' robot double with the HUGE breasts clearly visible my immediate reaction was " Ewwwwwwwww ! " So , this movie helped me come out !
477526	463200	70468	9.0	Depressing , disturbing	An English police officer , Sgt . Johnson ( Sean Connery ) is cracking under pressure on his job . He beats a rape suspect ( Ian Bannen ) to death . But why ? Was it the pressures of the job . . . or something else ? Combination murder mystery and character study . This film was a major bomb in 1973 and quickly disappeared from view . It's still virtually unknown - - I had no idea it even existed till it popped up on cable ! That's really a shame . It IS a very dark , depressing film but it's always absorbing and easily contains one of Connery's best performances . He's letter perfect as a tired , disgusted police officer who doesn't know how to deal with his job and the stress . There's an especially harrowing sequence between him and his wife ( Vivien Merchant ) when he tries to explain to her what's happening to him - - and she can't deal with it . Incidentally , Merchant's acting is superb also but it makes the scene very uncomfortable to watch . Also , Merchant was suffering from alcoholism at the time and she ( understandably ) looks horrible - - but it fits the role . Also Trevor Howard turns in a good performance as a lieutenant who has to question Johnson . Don't let his top billing fool you - - he doesn't show up until over an hour in and is only around for about 20 minutes . The picture isn't perfect - - SPOILERS AHEAD ! ! ! ! For one thing , the opening credits are in slow motion with a VERY annoying sound playing all through it . Also it gives away the ending . And director Sideney Lumet is ( almost constantly ) flashing a bright light in our faces - - it's annoying and not needed . The identity of the rapist is never made clear ( it's suggested - - that's all ) and Bannen ( as the suspect ) gives a VERY strange performance . I didn't know what to make of his character . Still , it is a great , if disturbing , motion picture . . . faults aside . Worth catching . . . but brace yourself . It's pretty strong stuff .
479609	463200	83642	9.0	Sadly forgotten	Big , splashy , fun musical about a whorehouse ( the Chicken Ranch ) in Texas run by Miss Mona ( Dolly Parton ) . She's in love with the sheriff ( Burt Reynolds ) and the town has no problem with the house . Then a sleazy TV showman ( Dom DeLuise ) exposes the ranch and all hell breaks lose . This was a huge bomb in 1982 for some reason . It's full of energy and enthusiasm , has great songs and some fantastic all out production numbers . Reynolds is just OK but Parton is an absolute joy - - she gives one of her best performances and even sings " I Will Always Love You " ( I prefer Whitney's version ) . Also there is equal amounts of male and female nudity and has a healthy attitude about sex ( this was made before AIDS was well-known about ) . And Charles Durning stops the show with his " sidestepping " number . . . he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for this . This should never have bombed - - maybe the title scared people away . Only complaint is the ending . It's way too serious and realistic - - I wish they had opted for a fairy tale like ending . Also Lois nettleton's subplot is seriously underdeveloped - - I assume it was shot but cut out for the running time . See it and enjoy !
478165	463200	342172	9.0	Powerful	Documentary about the arrest of Arnold Friedman in 1987 . He received a package with images of young boys in sexual situations which he ordered . He then is accused , along with young son Jesse , of sexually molesting young boys in a computer class he taught at his house . But did he ? The documentary talks to prosecutors , family members , the police and the alleged victims , and it becomes very clear that the Friedmans did absolutely nothing . It's just a case of sexual hysteria that goes barreling out of control . Along with the interviews is home footage shot by family members during this time . You see the underside of a seemingly perfect suburban family and watch it slowly fall apart . Harrowing , moving , absolutely fascinating . One of the best documentaries ever made . A most definite must-see . . . but it is strong stuff .
478796	463200	48028	9.0	Near perfect movie	WARNING - - There are going to be many plot spoilers in this review . This takes place in 1917 Monterey , California . Adam Trask ( Raymond Massey ) is bringing up two sons alone - - Cal ( James Dean ) and Aaron ( Richard Davalos ) . He tells them their mother ( Jo Van Fleet ) is dead but actually she left him and is now a madam in a neighboring town . Adam doesn't like Cal but loves Aaron and his girlfriend Abra ( Julie Harris ) . Cal tries to get his father's love in any way he can but things escalate and get worse and end tragically . In some ways this is just great . Some of the direction by Elia Kazan is annoying ( he continuously frames sequences at tilted angles which throws you out of the movie ) but all in all it works . The acting is superb . Massey is good and Van Fleet is very good - - she won a Best Supporting Actress award for this . She's good but not THAT good ! Burl Ives is also excellent in a supporting role . However the three young leads carry this movie . Davalos is just great in his role - - especially at the end when he meets mother . Harris ( top billed ) is just wonderful . She perfectly captures her characters innocence . Dean is just simply superb . When he's on screen you can't stop watching him . He captures his characters hatred and yearning to get his fathers love . The scene where he breaks down at his fathers party at the end is just heart-breaking . My problems with this is the story jumps around . At one point Cal seems to have a girlfriend - - but we're never introduced to her or find out who she is . Also Cal seems to be punished at the end . For what ? Trying to win the love of an uncaring father ? For showing his brother the truth about their mother ? I never bought the end for one second . That prevents me from giving this a 10 - - but it does deserve a 9 . Worth seeing .
479257	463200	34856	9.0	Still powerful	A Nazi officer ( Tim Holt ) falls in love with a freedom-fighting American girl ( Bonita Granville ) in WWII Germany . Very dated ( of course ) but still worth seeing . The film pulls no punches is showing how horrible life in Germany was during the war . I especially like them showing German citizens as being against Hitler and unhappy also . It is naive ( concentration camps are mentioned once and very casually ) but , at the time this was made , that's all we knew about Germany . A big hit in its day - - it's easy to see why . Holt and Granville are good in the leads - - especially Holt who has a powerful speech at the end . Also the film moves quickly and is never dull . A very good look at Germany during WWII . Well worth catching .
477848	463200	56869	9.0	Still scary	Melanie Daniels ( Tippi Hedren ) visits Bodega Bay to give some birds to Mitch Brenner ( Rod Taylor ) a man who flirted with her once . While there her and Mitch begin to fall in love . But also strange things are happening - - birds seem to be attacking people for no reason . The attacks escalate and soon Mitch , Melanie and their friends are fighting against birds who attack and kill for no reason . . . Some of the dialogue is awkward and it goes on way too long but this is one of Hitchcock's most frightening films . It's beautifully shot and everything looks perfect . The only real debits are the length and Hedren's lousy acting ( she was beautiful - - but no actress ) . Taylor gives out a good performance and Jessica Tandy and Suzanne Pleshette are excellent in strong supporting roles . Still , I have trouble watching this movie . I love horror films and pride myself on being able to sit through anything but I get horrified watching this film . Children are attacked twice - - I seriously draw the line at films that have children being hurt . The sequences at the birthday party and ( especially ) the school ( with the infamous jungle gym bit ) are just harrowing . Seeing screaming children running in terror as birds peck at them them is not fun . But then it isn't supposed to be . Also Hedren being attacked is even worse . The poor actress had a bunch of birds tied to her by nylon rope - - when the birds tried to fly away they couldn't and , naturally , attacked Hedren . They shot that for THREE DAYS until Hedren had a complete nervous breakdown . Knowing this makes the scene even harder to watch . And the discovery of Pleshette's body is hard too . Some people have complained that no reason was given for the birds attacking but seriously - - what reason COULD they give ? A strong , frightening film but one of Hitch's best horror films . Decidedly not for children .
478706	463200	53146	9.0	Just stunning	The Greek legend of Orpheus and Eurydice updated to Rio de Janeiro of 1959 during carnival . It's shot in bright color and is subtitled . Orpheus ( Breno Mello ) is being pushed into marriage by beautiful but dangerous Mira ( Lourdes de Oliveira ) . Then he meets sweet innocent Eurydice ( Marpessa Dawn ) and falls in love . But Death is stalking Eurydice and Mira will kill to get Orpheus . . . I only know the bare facts of the Greek legend and I think you DO need some knowledge of it to totally enjoy the film . . . but maybe not . The film is bursting with energy . . . there is virtual nonstop music and some of the most incredible dancing I've ever seen in a film . What's most pleasing about this film is seeing a community of black Porteguese men and women who are always there for each other and always happy and dancing . It may not be realistic but it fits the movie perfectly . Mello and Dawn are both attractive with great bodies and make a very likable couple . de Oliveira is downright frightening as Mira . . . and the appearance of Death ( a man in a skintight black costume with a skull mask ) is actually quite frightening . But it's the music and dancing that propels this film . . . it takes up a great part of it and you can't take your eyes off the screen ! Towards the end I actually caught myself sort of " dancing " in my seat bopping to the music ! The film does drag down a little at the end when a character dies and a strange ( and dull ) voodoo ceremony is thrown in . . . but this is a small complaint . A riveting beautiful film - - I've been lucky enough to see it twice in a theatre . I give it a 9 .
479117	463200	36260	9.0	Top notch film noir	Scott Henderson ( Alan Curtis ) is unjustly accused of killing his unfaithful wife . The night she was murdered he was out with a mystery woman who refused to give him her name . After accused of the murder , the police visit all the places he had been with her , but people only remember him being alone . He's sentenced to die and his secretary ( Ella Raines ) sets out to find the murderer herself because she loves him . This was made as a B film from Universal ( look at the cast - - all character actors and one star - - Franchot Tone - - on the decline ) . The budget was small and the cast mostly unknown but what came out is one of the best film noirs of the 1940s . It's beautifully directed by Curt Siodmak and has a fantastic script that came from an excellent book by William Irish ( a pen name for Cornell Woolrich ) . It moves quickly and just looks fantastic . And there's the infamous jam session with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr . which just comes off the screen with incredible sexual energy ( I'm surprised the censors didn't cut it ) . There are only a few flaws that prevent this from being perfect . Tone gives a dreadful performance . He looks ghastly and he's just horrible . Also Curtis is stiff and bland as Henderson . You really wonder why Raines loves him - - he's so unemotional . But Raines is pretty good in the lead role . She's pretty and full of life . Also the last scene when the murderer is after her never rings true . He's hardly a threat physically and her reactions just seem overstated . Still I'm giving this a 9 . A really great film - - flaws aside .
477321	463200	20640	9.0	One of the best Marx Brothers films	The plot here is really secondary . It involves Captain Jeffrey Spaulding ( Groucho ) coming to a rich woman's ( Margaret Dumont - - as always ) house for the unveiling of a famous painting . Harpo and Chico are on hand as musicians and are hired to steal the painting . Zeppo is wasted ( as always ) and there's a groan-worthy romantic subplot between Lillian Roth and Hal Thompson . This isn't a perfect film . Ther are some problems - - it's based on a stage play - - and it shows ; the plot gets real silly ; some of the songs are terrible ; Chico and Harpo have their obligatory ( and dull ) piano and harp solos ; there's an incredibly fake-sounding thunderstorm and Roth is TERRIBLE . Also there's one sequence where Harpo keeps hitting Dumont in the stomach - - that's NOT funny . Still there's enough good material here to make it worth watching . There's a great poker game with Chico , Hapo , Dumont and another guest ; the " Hooray for Captain Spaulding " number ; Dumonts facial expressions are priceless and there are plenty of nonsensical conversations between Chico and Harpo - - even Zeppo gets into one ! This was out of circulation from the 1950s to the 1970s ( for some reason ) . When it came back out it was released to theatres and a big hit . Worth seeing .
477402	463200	95675	10.0	Almodovar at full throttle	Funny , outrageous , ridiculous , colorful and fascinating film by Almodovar - - his most popular film in America ( so far ) . The story defies description but , basically , it's about three women ( an actress , a psychopath and one on the run from the law ) who are all affected by one man . THe story starts slow , picks up speed and is barreling out of control by the end . Well-acted , beautiful to look at and never a dull moment . Just see it ! You won't be disappointed . Love the cabdriver and his cab !
477833	463200	26266	10.0	Just great !	Film follows the life of David Copperfield ( Freddie Bartholomew as a boy , Frank Lawton as a man ) and all the colorful characters he meets in 1880s England . I've never read the book so I can't say how faithful this is , but as a movie it's just wonderful ! The sets are beautiful , it's very well-directed by George Cukor and there's some wonderful acting here . Special notice must be given to - - Bartholomew who is excellent as the young Copperfield ( he was only 11 when he did this ! ) ; Elizabeth Allen as his mother ; Basil Rathbone as the evil Mr . Murdstone ; Lionel Barrymore as Peggotry ; Edna May Oliver as Aunt Bessie ; Made Evans as Agenes Whitfield ; Hugh Williams as Steerforth and Roland Young as Uriah Heep . The only real bad acting was by Lawton ; Maureen O'Sullivan who's just awful as Dora and W . C . Fields as Micawber - - Fields was a wonderful COMEDIC actor but this was a dramatic role . Never boring despite the length and a perfect example of the kind of picture they just don't make these days . One of the best pictures of the 1930s - - a definite must-see !
479640	463200	21571	10.0	Just stunning	This silent film focuses on a small Ukranian village in 1930 . It's about small independent farmers working against a " collective " - - a state run collaboration of farms . The film ( kind of ) is about their conflict . To be truthful there isn't much of a story - - that's secondary in this film . The imagery is what counts and it's truly stunning . It contains some of the most gorgeous footage I've ever seen of nature and , in images , clearly documents man's love of the earth . There are characters and a minor story but they're actually pretty bad - - the story is painfully slow , the acting horrendous ( one very good-looking actor just stands there with a big beautiful grin on his face no matter WHAT the scene is about ) and has some of the most laughable dialogue cards I've ever seen ( I'm assuming it doesn't translate well from Russian ) . Also the " restored " print looks pretty terrible . Still the images are incredible and there's a beautiful music score going along with it . Historically and visually this is a landmark of world cinema - - a definite must-see . Try to see the unedited prints which contain surprising ( for 1930 ) female nudity .
477221	463200	65488	10.0	Like it or not , it's powerful	A bunch of gay men ( and one straight guy ) get together for a birthday party . Things slowly barrel out of control , the men attack each other and " The Truth Game " tears them apart . I'm an out , proud gay man and I love this movie . Yes , it's a downer - - yes , they all hate themselves - - yes , they tear each other apart . But you know what ? Those men EXIST ! I met them when I came out in the 80s and they're still around now almost 20 years later . Go to any popular gay bar on a Saturday night and you'll find plenty of Michaels in full voice . Also , this film was made in 1970 when homosexuality was still considered a mental illness and was against the law in many states - - no wonder these guys were miserable . Also , it was a milestone in Hollywood - - the first movie which dealt with all gay characters and not one of them killed himself ! I saw it unedited on TV when I was closeted and it didn't depress me at all . It was uplifting ( in a strange way ) . Even though these men are clawing at each other , they're still friends and they are there for each other . Also , the " Truth Game " has never been played at parties I've gone to . So , you may not like it , but gay men like this do exist . Avoid at all costs the cut TV version . It's 13 MINUTES shorter and is incomprehensible .
477644	463200	78480	10.0	Excellent animated film - - more for older children and adults	British animated film about a bunch of rabbits leaving their old warren ( which one psychic rabbit can tell is going to be destroyed ) and searching for a new one . The movie recounts their adventures searching for one . It may sound like a movie ideal for little kids - - but it really isn't . It's an excellent adaptation of Richard Adams book which was written more for teenagers and adults . It's an ecological tale of how men are destroying the earth and ( inadvertently it seems ) killing innocent wildlife . It's also a very interesting story about how a group of rabbits survive on their own . The animation is excellent - - right up there with Walt Disney . The score is great , the script intelligent and the voices used perfectly match the characters . However , as I said , this isn't really for little kids . The story is dead serious and the only humor is provided by the bird Kehaar ( who I personally found very annoying although Zero Mostel DOES have fun with the voice ) . Also , at the end , it gets very violent and quite bloody . When I saw it in a theatre in 1978 one small kid was in tears by the conclusion . So , use your own judgment but I would never let a small kid see this . This is perfect for teenagers and adults . A 10 .
477975	463200	424136	10.0	Disturbing but a must-see	A guy in his thirties Jeff ( Patrick Wilson ) meets teenage Hayley ( Ellen Page ) online . They agree to meet . They get along and she goes to his house with him . Then she drugs his drink . He wakes up tied to a chair and Hayley calling him a pedophile and prepared to teach him a lesson . But is he ? Basically just a 2 person movie and mostly all talk but absolutely fascinating . The will of wits between the two characters is just stunning and has you questioning if Hayley is right or if Jeff is innocent . It's incredible how the movie has you feeling pity for BOTH of the characters at different times . You're never sure who's right and how it will end up . The acting is superb . I must say Patrick Wilson shocked me . I saw him in " Angels in America " and " Phantom of the Opera " . I thought he was a very handsome man but a bland actor . This movie changed all that . He's just brilliant ! The agony and terror his character goes through seems all too real . This part demands a LOT out of any actor and he pulls it off . Very brave . Page is downright terrifying . Her character is ( obviously ) unstable and you're never sure what she'll do next . Again . . . a very difficult role but she pulls it off . Also the direction is great . Everything is done in closeups of the actors faces . At first it annoyed me - - then I realized it works in the movies favor giving it a very claustrophobic , uneasy feeling . This is not for everybody . It's grim and explicit ( in terms of dialogue ) and I'm sure there are moments which might have some guys bolting for the exits . I found it unsettling and fascinating . If you can handle the subject matter I strongly recommend this . A 10 .
478177	463200	113443	10.0	Touching and powerful drama	Brandon Theis ( Gregory Harrison ) and Nick Stark ( Eric Roberts ) have been lovers for years . Then Nick is diagnosed with HIV . Brandon promises to not leave him - - - but eventually does . He can't handle The HIV . A year later Nick is told he will die very soon of lesions in the brain . Rather than slowly become a vegetable and wither away , Nick decides to commit suicide . He invites all of his friends to a 2 day party - - at the end , he'll take the pills and die . Brandon finds out and attends the party . But does Nick want him there and will Nick be able to forgive him before he goes ? Strong , powerful movie . I saw it in a theatre in 1996 and cried my eyes out . I saw it 2 years later with a friend and we BOTH cried our eyes out ! Saw it again tonight - - cried again . This drama is harrowing at times and brings about questions about love , death with dignity , suicide , HIV . . . etc etc . But it never gets too maudlin and is always fascinating . Roberts is just superb as Nick . Strong , handsome , refusing to wither away . He also approaches his HIV condition with strength and humor - - as he should . Lee Grant is ( sadly ) wasted as his mother . Harrison is so-so as his boyfriend . Usually he's sort of stone-faced but there were a few moments that the looks on his face made me break down . There's one scene of him and Roberts just looking at each other across the room - - you can see the love , fear and hatred in their faces - - it's just great . And Harrison really delivers during the last 30 minutes of the movie . There's a huge cast in this movie - - Margaret Cho ( hilarious ) ; Marlee Matlin ( wasted ) ; Olivia Newton-John ( just great ) ; Bronson Pinchot ( overdoing the bitchiness a bit ) ; Bruce Davison ; Roddy McDowall . There's the problem - - there are too MANY characters ! I'm still not sure who McDowell was and Sally Kellerman shows up looking great but - - who is she ? We're never told . Also , the party scenes are scattershot - - the camera seems to linger around catching certain characters and snatches of their conversations . I also have a hard time believing that anyone has this many friends and they all keep quiet about him committing suicide . Still - - problems aside this works . I think this film hit too close for director / writer Randal Kleiser . Supposedly he went through the same things with his lover . When this movie was released he couldn't promote it . It came ( and went ) very quickly . That's really a shame . It's a strong , powerful movie that should be seen by everybody . And Roberts gives out one of his best performances . The scene when him and Harrison kiss is heart-breaking . Well worth catching - - an excellent drama . Just bring plenty of tissues - - you'll need them !
478662	463200	29658	10.0	Grim , powerful	A young girl ( Lana Turner in her first role ) is killed in a small Southern town . A Northener , Robert Hale ( Edward norris ) is accused of it . . . but is he guilty ? It doesn't seem to matter because everybody uses his accusation for their own gain . Fast moving , still relevant ( sadly ) look at prejudice , gossip , mob rule and media manipulation . Occasionally the characters give out unmotivated speeches ( especially Hale's wife ) , but the movie is very well-written and acted with Claude Rain chewing the scenery again and again . A must see . . . don't miss this one !
478846	463200	473434	10.0	Absolutely amazing	In 1963 14 British children , all age 7 but of varying classes , were interviewed about a variety of subjects . Thereafter they were interviewed every seven years . This is the seventh installment . By now only 12 are left ( 2 dropped out ) . This may be deadly boring to some but I found it fascinating - - you see the most recent interviews along with clips from all the previous shows . You literally see these people grow up before your eyes - - you share their struggles , dreams and triumphs . This was originally done to trace something about social classes - - but that seems to have been dropped . There's nothing extraordinary about these people - - they're mostly plain , average men and women just doing their best to get through life . Sounds dull but I was spellbound throughout . I saw 28 , 35 and 42 Up also and , in a strange way , seeing this was like having a class reunion ! You get in touch with people you haven't seen in a number of years and catch up on them . I remember all of these people from the previous episodes and I loved seeing them again and how most have happy content lives . Not for everybody but I couldn't stop watching . This should really be the last one . One woman makes it clear that she won't do another one and all of the participants comment on how the show negatively affected their lives . So maybe it's time to let them go . Not for everybody but I give it a 10 .
477463	463200	71286	10.0	Ahead of its time	Harrowing drama of a married woman ( Elizabeth Montgomery ) who is raped twice by the same man . She is treated like a piece of meat in the hospital ( the scene where someone photographs her bruises is unbelievable ) and , in court , they act like she deserved it . I saw this on TV when I was 12 and have never forgotten it . Before this there was never any talk ( on TV at least ) about this subject . Also , back then , rape was considered an act of lust ( ! ! ! ! ) . This haunted me for days after the initial showing . What really got to me was the uncompromising , realistic ending - - TV , at that time , always had pat , happy endings . Not this one . Montgomery was absolutely superb in her role and the rapes were presented tastefully . This movie was a HUGE hit in its first two showings . I believe it was instrumental in changing the publics perception of how rape is a disgusting act of violence and how it can destroy a woman's life . This isn't available in any form that I know of , and that's a shame . It's now 30 years old and deserves a release on DVD . If you can see it , do so . A definite must-see .
477316	463200	20629	10.0	Still works after over 70 years !	A bunch of young enthisiastic German schoolboys volunteer for WWI believing it to be a noble and fun thing to do for their country . They quickly find out that war is a living hell . One of the first ( and best ) anti-war films ever made . It has problems - - the sound recording is not that good and the acting is bad - - the guys are either overacting or pretty wooden and there is some howlingly bad dialogue . But it still works . Lewis Milestones ' direction helps . The battle scenes are long , vicious and pretty graphic ( for 1930 ) and he really makes you feel all the pain and agony the soldiers endure . There are many unforgettable scenes : a young man , his eyes shot out , screaming and stumbling in a battlefield ; a young soldier trapped in a crater with a corpse of the enemy , the sequence where the soldiers are being driven mad by nonstop bombing from the enemy and a final scene that packs a real wallop . It's also interesting to see flashes of male nudity ( this was pre-Code ) and Lew Ayres so young and full of life . It's hard to believe such an old film can still work so strongly but this does . I can imagine the impact this had in 1930 . See the full 130 minute version . . . avoid the edited 105 minute one . Good luck finding a clear print with good sound .
