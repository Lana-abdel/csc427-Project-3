Bob Nolan and the " Sons of the Pioneers " are around when necessary . Gamblers aboard the boat " Casino Del Mar " aka " S . S . Casino " are the main adversaries , led by nasty George Meeker ( as Reed Calhoun ) . This film is very poorly performed and presented by Rogers and company . Ms . Evans is absurd as a disguised Senorita , and her song " There's Nothing ' Like Coffee in the Morning " looks like a breakfast commercial try-out . Mr . Howlin's quickly disappearing " black eye " might have been better placed on the entire disjointed production . Apache Rose ( 1947 ) William Witney - Roy Rogers , Dale Evans , Olin Howland

Horrifically re-produced from the original Spanish , " The Fury of the Wolf Man " loses whatever charms it may have possessed in its original form . Lycanthropic Paul Naschy's werewolf characterization is uneven and ineffectual . Dominatrix scientist Perla Cristal and sexy assistant Verónica Luján never get close enough to truly titillate .

The hostage victims are so taken by their abductor's charms , they begin to fight over him - desiring to continue serving him as hostage , in Mexico . Halfway into the story , Joe ( William Smith ) arrives , posing as a traveling salesman ( the " Stanley " character referred to in the episode title ) .

To wit , Mr . Corrigan witnesses his " friend " Frank Merrill ( as Ed Bradford ) in the old silent serial . Mr . Merrill , who also played " Tarzan " , must have got a kick out of seeing himself co-starring in a new movie , after almost 20 years of retirement from film .

Complicating matters are Ms . Funicello's boozy race car boyfriend Warren Berlinger ( as Eddie Sands ) , and her father Jan Murray ( as Pete Madsen ) , who encourages the reckless drivers . Funicello's cow-eyed performance is sometimes enjoyable ; however , her drunken driving scene is unnerving . " Thunder Alley " provides marginally more NASCAR excitement than its predecessor , " Fireball 500 " ( 1966 ) ; be warned , it isn't much .

Astute observers will know the " twitch " in the ending cameo isn't even done correctly . On the plus side , Mr . Keaton has more to do this time around , and it's good to see he and Mr .

Pickford was one of the greatest early film performers ; and , this , her first sound offering , is an artistic failure . The Helen Hayes play " Coquette " ( 1927 ) might have seemed like an ideal way to introduce a talking Pickford . Sadly , it may have contributed to her impending retirement from films ; and , Pickford continued to choose some questionable film projects . The opening scenes , with Pickford positively awful as the coquettish southern belle " Norma Besant " , are embarrassing . If you can get used to the characters , later scenes may marginally repair the damage ; in fact , the much admired " trial " and " cabin " breakdown scenes earned Pickford a " Best Actress " Oscar .

Edmund McDonald ( as Ross Lambert ) leads the evil-doers . The story is slight . Mr . Burnette and Mr . Hayes team-up for a ludicrous " two-men-in-the-horse " joke . This , and action sequences appear to have been speeded up for dramatic and / or comic effect . The film includes a generous , interesting amount of location work ; climaxing with a storm-drenched river scene . Unfortunately , the relatively low budget makes certain sequences appear more technically incompetent than exciting . Song highlights are when Mr .

In the spring of 1910 , a New York mining company's contract with the Republic comes up for renewal . Paragonia's " Minister of War " Carl Stockdale ( as Salsa Espada ) is alone in opposing the renewal ; he thinks Americans are " pigs " , and wants to rule the Republic . President Spottiswoode Aiken ( as Hernando de Valdez ) and Premier Tote du Crow ( as Alberto de Castille ) have their way , and the contract is signed . Meanwhile , Mr . Aiken's comely daughter Alma Rubens ( as Juana de Valdez ) attracts suitors like Charles Stevens ( as Colonel Gargaras ) . In New York City , young mining engineer Douglas Fairbanks ( as " The Americano " ) is offered a job in Paragonia . At first , Fairbanks refuses ( " Too far from Brooklyn ! " ) - - but , when he sees fetching Ms . Rubens visiting the American Mining Company office , he is smitten . Upon arrival , Fairbanks finds the dictatorial Mr . Stockdale has taken over the country , and thrown its popular president in prison . Moreover , Rubens is being forced into an unhappy marriage ? This was the last , and not the best , of the Fairbanks " Triangle " films supervised by D . W . Griffith . The acclaimed director's influence can be seen occasionally , in the film's relatively elaborate structure , and characterizations . For example , Reubens is introduced petting a bird . And , while it wasn't only Griffith who employed offensive black-faced characters like Tom Wilson ( as Harold Armitage " Whitey " White ) , he created this role for Wilson ( who pets his lucky rabbit's foot ) . The Mexican locale is a highlight .

Mr . Litel gets to play the leading man , but in a low-budget , under-rehearsed quickie . Perky reporter Florence Rice ( as Linda Gregory ) , in her penultimate screen appearance , is Litel's main female interest . Ms . Rice wears very TALL headgear .

Can he rally the townspeople to save the monument from demolition ? Although the Courthouse in danger is a Confederate Courthouse , there is no political agenda offered by the film - it's simply a story about weeding out political corruption , and preserving an old building . There is , however , a stereotypical servant ( called " Orderly 98 " ) who isn't too hard to take until his offensive fencing scene with Coburn . The " whistle " which accompanies close-ups of Ms . Bennett's legs is ridiculous . Don't expect authentic Georgia accents . A nice idea , and a competent cast , aren't enough to lift this " Colonel Effingham's Raid " .

Through the combined efforts of the sheriff and a quick witted mechanic , the source of the problem is discovered , a fifty-foot Gila monster who has run out of food , and is now preying upon the local populace , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . God's unexplored wilderness ( aka Texas ) , as shown in the film's beginning , includes no sign of food ; so , it's only natural to have its " Giant Gila Monster " leave . It starts off by eating two tasty teenagers , who are trying to enjoy some " submarine races " . The director , Ray Kellogg , seems to have a thing for actors putting their legs up somewhere . Watch for both hero Don Sullivan ( as Chase ) and Sheriff Fred Graham ( as Jeff ) to put their legs up together , in the auto-mechanic shop ( Compton's Garage ) . The characterizations are interesting . Sullivan is an older " influence " on the younger and more rebellious " gang " of teenagers ; and , he has turned from hot-rodder to auto-mechanic . He is supporting his mother and crippled little sister . Sullivan also sings well ; although , his choice of material definitely does NOT rock . Not as much is revealed about Mr . Graham's character ; but , he is refreshingly non-confrontational with the younger cast members . The movie is at least two legs up over awful , and is fun to watch with friends .

Twelvetrees attracts Montana cowboy Clark Gable ( as Rance Brett ) , who helps at the ranch . When Twelvetrees gets a hankerin ' for Mr . Boyd , the spurned Mr . Gable gets jealous . Often described as Gable's first " talkie " , this film might more accurately be described as his first role of consequence . Note , Gable had about as much to say in " Du Barry , Woman of Passion " as in most of his silent films . Farnum , a huge star in the mid-teens , was in the talking " Du Barry " , also . Considering the successful careers had by Farnum , Boyd and Gable , this film is quite disappointing . The dialogue comes out of everyone's mouth like molasses . A little fun to see the stars somewhat dimmer than usual .

The plot thickens when Mr . Lewis and " Moon " tribe woman Margaret Lee ( as Moah ) fall in love . In English , misleadingly reproduced as " Fire Monsters Against the Son of Hercules " ( ) . The English dubbing is dreadful ; in a couple of scenes , two completely different voices dub Lewis . The bleached-blond muscleman throws cavemen around , and poses . Mr . Marin essays his part better than others ; but , considering the shoddiness of the production , it's a wasted effort . The best part of the movie is the added-on TV theme song , " The ( Mighty ) Sons of Hercules " .

When Donna's reputation as a " super-mom " becomes the talk of the town , Alex begins to wonder about his worth . So , Donna turns Alex's birthday party into an homage to father Stone .

While some ministers pass around collection plates , Mr . Johnson reaches into his pocket to give an offering to needy bums . Enter Stephanie Longfellow ( as Mary Rollins ) ; she is in cahoots with thieves Frank Powell and Henry B .

452579	15896852	71634	3.0	Huck and Jim Sing	Unnecessary and unsatisfying musical rendering of Mark Twain's classic " Adventures of Huckleberry Finn " . At least , it captures the genuine friendship between Jeff East ( as Huckleberry Finn ) and Paul Winfield ( as Jim ) . However , these two performers are much more likable in other projects . Interestingly , Mr . East portrayed " Huck " in 1973's similarly presented re-make of " Tom Sawyer " , which was considered the better film . In my opinion , East would have been a better " Tom " than " Huck " . Some of the photography is rather nice , especially during the more moody ending . The Sherman-Sherman musical numbers are well below standard . The movie doesn't seem much like the book . Roberta Flack sings " Freedom " to end it all , at last . Huckleberry Finn ( 1974 ) J .

The fatal shot is fired in semi-darkness while a distinguished audience observes the stars projected on the dome above them . A hardboiled homicide detective ( Russell Hopton ) trades verbal jabs with a wisecracking gal reporter ( Lola Lane ) as they attempt to unravel the mysterious killing , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . In a very dull manner . The " gal reporter " character played by Lola Lane was , in part , writer Jerry Siegel's inspiration for Superman's Girl Friend , " Lois Lane " ; however , Ms . Lane's later " Torchy Blane " characterization is a more accurate reference point . Perhaps , " Death from a Distance is most notable as featuring the penultimate performance of George F . Marion ( as Jim Gray ) , who so memorably played the father of Pauline Lord ( 1921 ) , Blanche Sweet ( 1923 ) , and Greta Garbo ( 1930 ) in Eugene O'Neill's " Anna Christie " .

Kenney hooks up with salesman John Agar ( as Bob Westley ) . Then , Kenney learns Mr . Hoyt's previous secretary has mysteriously disappeared , along with a mailman ( they didn't elope ) . Soon , Mr . Agar joins the missing persons list . When an Agar doll turns up among Hoyt's creations , Kenney freaks . Could the odd " Mr . Franz " be , in reality , a mad scientist ? Could he be turning people into dolls ? Is Kenney next ? A very small budget , and likely short production time keeps " Attack of the Puppet People " from becoming something bigger . Still , the direction ( Bert I . Gordon ) and story situations keep things moving along ; a " drive-in " movie and silly theme song are pleasant diversions . The film's main asset is the lead performance of the smooth talking John Hoyt as the obviously touched , but slightly touching , " Mr . Franz " . My contribution to the movie's unanswered questions is , " What about the other doll people in the plastic tubes ? " Attack of the Puppet People ( 1958 ) Bert I .

452363	15896852	49006	3.0	Beyond a Reasonable Plot	The film begins with an interesting premise : A writer and a newspaperman are anti-Capitol Punishment . They decide to " frame " the writer ( Mr . Andrews ) for murder ; after he is tried and convicted , they plan to reveal he didn't commit the murder - saving him from the electric chair and showing how easily an innocent man can be killed with circumstantial evidence . The movie held my attention , albeit barely . For a movie requiring you to THINK ( as in , think about Capitol Punishment ) , you really can't THINK at all . The more I thought , the more I had questions - about the PLOT of this story - like WHAT do these guys think should happen to the " REAL KILLER " of this woman ? You really have to turn off you brain to fully enjoy Beyond a Reasonable Doubt , because it makes no sense if you think it through . . . I had events pretty much figured out before they happened . I thought too much , I guess . I don't think the film says much about Capitol Punishment , but the IDEA is a good one ; it would make a much better film in more adept hands .

453621	15896852	65079	4.0	Shooting the Breeze	The opening explains , " In the summer of 1909 , a member of the oldest American minority , a Paiute Indian named Willie Boy , became the center of an extraordinary historical event . This is what happened in the deserts of California . " The setting seems more 1969 than 1909 . The plot gets started when downtrodden Indian Robert Blake ( as Willie Boy ) is caught in a sexual liaison with his Indian mate , Katharine Ross ( as Lola ) , by her father . Believing he will be killed , Mr . Blake shoots Ms . Ross ' dad dead . Then , the couple go on the run , pursued by handsome Sheriff Robert Redford ( as " Coop " ) . Mr . Redford isn't as prejudiced as others in his posse , who'd prefer Blake be brought back dead . This film gets credit for renovating the careers of Jennings Lang and Abraham Polonsky ; but , it isn't , otherwise , very remarkable . Redford and Ross , riding on the success of " Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid " , receive relatively exaggerated billing , over Blake and Susan Clark ( as Liz Arnold ) . Robert Lipton ( as Charlie ) strums the guitar , but does not sing a theme song . The film is well-intentioned , but dull .

Wanda Hendrix adds femininity to " My Outlaw Brother " . Tip your cowboy hat to Mickey Rooney , who is the film's greatest asset ; and , he gets the larger women . Mr . Stack is penetrating as Rooney's unlikely brother . Mr . Preston makes a good partner ; wisely , he is low key in the presence of Rooney . Just an interesting cast in a slight film .

Starring Antonio Banderas , Salma Hayek , Johnny Depp , Mickey Rourke , Eva Mendes , Enrique Iglesias , and Willem Dafoe , ' Once Upon a Time in Mexico ' is a full-frontal assault , " according to the DVD sleeve . That's about as good a description of this blood-splattering , testicle-crunching Robert Rodriguez film as you're going to get . Mr . Rodriguez borrows the title , some of the style , but little of the greatness from Sergio Leone's " Once Upon a Time in the West " . Hard to dope it all out .

452517	15896852	43547	4.0	Never Getting Off the Ground	Don't get too excited about the prospect of seeing John Wayne and Robert Ryan in a Nicholas Ray-directed World War II drama . Considering those three names , " Flying Leathernecks " does not meet expectations . It's a mediocre Howard Hughes-RKO-commissioned war movie . Mr . Ray shows off his most " production line " direction . Mr . Wayne ( as Dan Kirby ) and Mr . Ryan ( as Carl " Griff " Griffin ) have an vacuous attitude conflict ; it's interesting to watch their acting techniques , without being distracted by a sensible story . A script highlight is the cute reference to the nursery rhyme " Jack and Jill went up the hill ? " Jay C . Flippen ( as Clancy ) provides additional " comic relief " , but check out the " narration track " , for real laughs . Also notable is the inclusion of several scenes from the actual war , in color ; however , this footage would be more appropriately seen in a documentary .

" The movie's story is likewise without direction . For what seems like an interminable length of time , the volcano Krakatoa spurts and sputters - - you are teased by the threatening eruption . During this time , the film should be providing its great characterizations ; so , you really care about the people who are soon to be blanketed with volcanic lava and / or tsunami waters . That doesn't exactly happen . Some of the special effects are explosive . Stars Maximilian Schell ( as Captain Hanson ) and Diane Baker ( as Laura ) are fine performers , who seem to be trying their best with the material . Brian Keith ( as Connerly ) is wasted . Sal Mineo ( as Leoncavallo ) is the best supporting player ; though the director cuts away from him a little too soon following a nice " goodbye " scene with father Rossano Brazzi , it shows the most unused potential . Mr . Mineo resembles Marlon Brando in pensive medium shots - - too bad he didn't get more Brando-caliber scripts . Krakatoa , East of Java ( 1969 ) Bernard L .

453117	15896852	20143	4.0	Marion Meets the Moustache	Marion Davies moves unsteadily into sound films , as the title character in the musical " Marianne " . This was Davies ' first sound film ; a silent version was filmed earlier . In her first aural offering , Ms . Davies combines silent mannerisms with a sometimes lilting , sometimes grunting French accent . Davies is admired by several U . S . soldiers , but mostly Lawrence Gray ( as Stagg ) . Mr . Gray helps retrieve Davies ' stolen pig , albeit mostly eaten . There are several embarrassing scenes , but the film really goes downhill during a musical number involving Benny Rubin ( Sam ) and Cliff Edwards ( Soapy ) serenading a distraught Davies . This song and dance is followed by Davies doing deep knee bends , in drag , while bragging about her intimacy with a General . Later on , she does musical impressions of Maurice Chevalier and Sarah Bernhardt . They are not as fun as they sound ! Mr . Rubin sings " The Girl from Neufchâteau " extremely well , though ; his is the film's best musical performance . The best scene occurs with Davies in a military jeep , with Gray ; she is still disguised as a male officer , complete with moustache and a cap . The scene works because Davies , instead of playing a French woman , play-acts a French officer . Here , she proves herself an actress well-suited for talking pictures . You may also notice her sometimes uncanny resemblance to Lucille Ball ; especially , recall Ms . Ball's " Lucy Meets the Moustache " ( 1960 ) . It is most obvious Ball referenced some of Davies ' comic work .

Rogers , if elected Sheriff , will follow in the footsteps of his Roy Rogers namesakes ( including his father and grandfather ) . However , Rogers seems meek and mild ; though a popular man , townspeople wonder if he is up to the job . This is an interesting Rogers vehicle in that the character is presented as a hero perhaps not up to the task at hand ; no points for guessing how he does , finally ! There is the expected " shootout " to end the film , but it really peaks earlier as Rogers ' car is stolen ; he gets the car back in fine form . Rogers sings with Gabby , with Bob Nolan and the " Sons of the Pioneers " , and with some unfortunately intrusive dialog .

Despite director / writer David Cronenberg's script , " Shivers " isn't any great shakes as a bloody erotic horror . Mr . Cronenberg shows promise , however ; and , there are at least three sexy scenes . First , you have luscious Lynn Lowry ( as Forsythe ) sexily undressing . Also , still beautiful Barbara Steele ( as Betts ) takes a bath ; and , later , engages Susan Petrie ( as Janine Tudor ) in a seductive Lesbian kiss . Other than that , the movie features more bad hair than anything else . Cronenberg could have gotten off more steam by setting the maniacal sex parasites loose in a college . Paul Hampton ( as Roger St Luc ) emerges as the last man standing . Imaginatively re-titled " They Came from Within " and " The Parasite Murders " .

Everyone comes to the conveniently shore-situated " Jamaica Inn " , where leader Leslie Banks ( as Josh Merlyn ) and his gang hang out . Alfred Hitchcock directed this old English costume drama , before taking his work to Hollywood . So , there are some understandably well-directed moments ; and , the coastal and cave scenes are nicely done . However , " Jamaica Inn " is a poorly staged version of Daphne du Maurier's novel . The actors and director make it mildly entertaining ; but , the story does not captivate . Apparently , the cast had a contest involving outrageous eye make-up , which Mr . Laughton obviously won ( by a hair ) . Jamaica Inn ( 1939 ) Alfred Hitchcock - Charles Laughton , Maureen O'Hara , Robert Newton

But , in one day , the bustling building is going be demolished , " until the last brick is carted away . " Its " last night " attracts many nostalgic patrons to the " Continental " , but most importantly ( for the sake of this motion picture ) , it attracts embezzler Theodore von Eltz ( as James Bennett ) . The suave Mr . Von Eltz has just finished a stint in prison , and needs to collect a stash of money before the hotel closes . Von Eltz checks in as " A . R . Cooper " , and maneuvers his way into the suite where he stashed the money . Along the way , he falls in love with suicidal Peggy Shannon ( as Ruth Carleton ) . Von Eltz doesn't know it , but the duplicitous Ms . Shannon has ulterior motives ! You will need to check your brain at the door of the " Hotel Continental " , if you want to fully enjoy the movie . There is NO WAY this building is ready to be torn down . Every fixture remains in place - probably , even the soap and towels haven't been removed . The place is , also , doing rather brisk business . Mostly , director Christy Cabanne follows the Von Eltz / Shannon storyline , with drunken Irishman Bert Roach ( as Charlie Layton ) providing comic relief . Mr . Cabanne was a D . W . Griffith " Biograph " veteran , as was Henry B . Walthall , who has a small role ( as Tommy Winthrop ) . " Tiffany Productions " got this film out in time to get some box office overflow from MGM's impending " Grand Hotel " .

As a young woman , Ms . Woodbury finds herself struggling to keep a job , as her murdered father's ex-convict status makes Woodbury a bad business risk . Woodbury rooms with understanding songstress Linda Ware ( as Donna Andrews ) , who advises Woodbury to get in touch with old orphanage friends John Archer ( as Bob Elliott ) and Jack La Rue ( as Mickey Roman ) . But , none of her friends can help when Woodbury is the victim of a scam , which lands her in prison . Upon release , Woodbury decides to give the male mobsters a run for their money ? Re-titled " Gangs , Inc . " , this is an obviously weak , cheap mobster melodrama . Still , it's a lot of fun to watch Woodbury work wonders with inferior material . She plays the innocent growing more sophisticated " Rita " quite convincingly ; and , she tosses in a great bit as a blonde hooker . Woodbury must be added to the list of unfortunately underutilized Hollywood actresses of the past . " Paper Bullets " also features an early Alan Ladd ( as Jimmy Kelly aka Bill Dugan ) . Ms . Ware , who sang the hit " An Apple for the Teacher " with Bing Crosby , sings a couple of fair ' 40s numbers nicely . But , mainly , it's Woodbury's show .

As punishment , God periodically orders Helge Nissen ( as Satan ) to " ' Continue thy evil doings ! ' " And , director Carl Theodor Dreyer traces the Evil One's deeds through the ages . The film concentrates on three historically set studies : the crucifixion of Christ , the Spanish Inquisition , and the French Revolution ; with the fourth , and last , leaf in Satan's book the ( then ) contemporary Russian invasion / occupation of Finland . Dreyer is clearly inspired by D . W . Griffith's infinitely superior , and highly recommended , " Intolerance " ( 1916 ) .

It starts out a little like " Beach Party " - of-the-absurd , and moves to a reverse - " From Here to Eternity " , then muddles around . It ends with the " Big Battle . " There are some well-staged dramatic scenes ( Otto Preminger directed ) and some nice photography . It's nice to see Mr . Wayne with an age appropriate looking feminine interest in Ms . Neal , who lifts the film quite a bit with her presence . It's interesting to see Kirk Douglas ' and Mr . De Wilde's relative unsympathetic characterizations , which made me wonder about the filmmakers ' motives . Strange film , but admittedly star-studded , and worth a look .

Bernard receives word that a $2 , 000 payroll will be arriving by train , and placed in her trust . This attracts some bad elements ; specifically , tramps Edwin August and Alfred Paget ; they are plotting steal the $2 , 000 . . . Director D . W . Griffith's " cross-cutting " makes " A Girl and Her Trust " an exciting early silent , improving on the his earlier " The Lonely Villa " ( 1909 ) ; however , the story situation is not nearly as good as the forthcoming " An Unseen Enemy " ( 1912 ) , with the Gish sisters , which also improves on " The Lonedale Operator " , which this film is practically a re-make of . . . Bernard performs very well as the heroine ; Mr . Lucas steals both her heart , and co-acting honors . Griffith's cast of " extras " is always extraordinary . Though memorable , the way Bernard uses : a bullet , a keyhole , and scissors as a gun may have you shaking your head .
453026	15896852	15145	5.0	Taking a Powder	Rudolph Valentino ( as Philippe , aka the " Duke de Chartres " ) is a member of France's 18th century powder set ; he and royal cousin Bebe Daniels ( as Princess Henriette ) are quite a pair , but etiquette gets in the way . So , Mr . Valentino leaves the court of Lowell Sherman ( as King Louis XV ) and Lois Wilson ( as Queen Marie ) ; and , he relocates to Bath , England . There , he assumes the identity of ordinary barber " Monsieur Beaucaire " . Valentino enjoys life as a commoner ; nonetheless , he quickly assumes the role of a French nobleman , in order to romance Doris Kenyon ( as Lady Mary ) . Eventually , he realizes there's no place like home ? After a two year strike , Rudolph Valentino made " Monsieur Beaucaire " his comeback film . It's an elaborate , confusing , and mannered production . Nevertheless , in Valentino's case , absence did make the hearts of America grow fonder ; and , Valentino spent the next two years as the USA's top male Box Office Star . Probably , the position was enhanced due to the continued circulation of the star's previous hits . " Monsieur Beaucaire " is a valiant failure . Staid , light and shadow direction by Sidney Olcott , daintily made-up and costumed players , and elaborately designed scenes are featured . The story of a royal assuming the commoner's role is interesting ; but , despite the title , Valentino is only briefly seen in the entertaining role of barber . Possibly , the film's focus was lost during the making . One of Valentino's 1923 song recordings was added to the soundtrack ; listen for it when the star sings a serenade , near the film's beginning . A record wasn't released until later , but the song is chronologically correct , herein ; thematically , the Valentino recordings more closely fit other films , however . This recording , and Valentino's successful American tour , suggested a Garbo-like success in talking films was possible , had Valentino lived into the sound era .

453521	15896852	32342	5.0	Giving it Up for James Cagney	James Cagney ( as Danny ) is a New York City truck driver who takes up boxing in order to finance his brother Arthur Kennedy ( as Eddie ) ' s musical career . Ann Sheridan ( as Peggy ) is Danny's childhood girlfriend - she gives up their romance for a dancing career , and ends up weeping profusely for it . The film begins as the " City for Conquest " characters are children , living in New York city's lower East Side . Each child mirrors his / her adult development ; for example , " Danny " fights , " Peggy " dances , and " Eddie " squeezes his music box . These opening scenes are well-done , and effectively introduce the characters . However , the switch from children to adult actors fails because the " Danny " boy is so unlike actor James Cagney - it's very startling when Cagney appears . The other children are very well-cast ; the boy playing Elia Kazan's " Googi " character looks especially like the adult " Googi " . The boy playing Mr . Cagney looks so different , you have to wonder if another actor might have been planned to star in this film . Additionally , the children are depicted as being about the same age , but the adult Cagney appears much older when they are adults ; he goes from being about Ms . Sheridan's age to looking like her father ! He looks too out-of-shape for the role , also , of the " Young Samson " . Frank Craven appears as " Old Timer " ; he seems to have great knowledge , but his role is confusing . Anthony Quinn is Ms . Sheridan's greasy dancing partner ( and abductor ? ) Murray Burns . For some reason , Mr . Quinn spent WAY TOO LONG in the make-up chair - his eye make-up is the film's heaviest ! Yet , the cast is worth watching . James Cagney is , after all , still Cagney . Mr . Kennedy and Mr . Kazan perform their parts very well . The structurally flawed story does move - and , Sheridan's profuse weeping could squeeze one out of you .

453550	15896852	2521	5.0	A Sweet and Harrowing Story of the Early West	The story begins by introducing two married couples - - prospector Charles Gorman ( as Jack Hardy ) and his " Homesick for the East " wife Blanche Sweet ( as Alice ) ; and , Mexicans Charles Hill Mailes ( as Jim ) and wife Claire McDowell . The husbands meet at a saloon , where the Mr . Gorman makes a laughing stock out of the " good-for-nothing " Hill Mailes , then throws him out of the bar . Next , Hill Mailes joins a couple of cutthroats , and shoots " Indian " Robert Harron's father , just to watch him die . So , two of the film's characters seek revenge - - Hill Mailes wants to get even with Gorman for throwing him around ; and , Indian son Harron wants vengeance for his murdered father . Hill Mailes kidnaps his enemy's wife , Ms . Sweet ; and , despite advice from his Chief to keep the peace , Harron rounds up some Young Braves to go after Hill Mailes . Subtitled " A Story of the Early West " , " A Temporary Truce " compares very favorably with some of Director D . W . Griffith's more well-known " little epics " from the period . The southern California location sequences are exciting ; Griffith and cameraman G . W . Bitzer are , obviously , in the process of kicking up film-making a notch ( or two ) every year . Sweet gives a particularly fine performance as the kidnapped wife , and the other performers are , at least , interesting . Harron is noteworthy as the wronged Indian boy ; he steals the film , and tilts the story toward the unexpected side of the traditional " Cowboys and Indians " western . Extras include Mary's little brother , Jack Pickford , who joins Harron's Indian gang ; and , Mae Marsh is easy to spot as an murdered settler . It's strange to watch Ms . Marsh get attacked by Harron , so notable a future film partner !
453409	15896852	28603	5.0	The Best Movie Ever Made Starring John Beal and Joan Fontaine	Young New York City surgeon , and amateur pilot , John Beal ( as James Stanton ) rubs the older doctors at " General Hospital " the wrong way . Most of all , they consider his interest in flying an inappropriate hobby . After Mr . Beal gives the wife of another doctor a lift in his plane , it crashes ; and , the young woman dies . The accident becomes a national scandal , with the unwed Beal becoming romantically linked with his married passenger . After being put on probation , Beal gives up his privileged life , hitchhikes to California , and becomes a hobo . He is recognized by pilot friend Philip Huston ( as Dick Miller ) , who helps Beal get back up on his feet . Then , Mr . Huston , and pretty blonde nurse Joan Fontaine ( as Doris King ) help Beal turn his life around . Ms . Fontaine receives a special introduction in this , her first co-starring role . She is not only very obviously like her famous sister , but also very engaging . Fontaine's performances would grow more individual and adept , with increasingly better material . Although never growing into stars of Fontaine's stature , Beal and Huston are also quite good . It's nice to see the expressive Beal , who presided over the witchcraft trial of Quentin Collins on " Dark Shadows " , as a leading man . And , Huston essays a very convincing " drunk " scene .

453474	15896852	271259	5.0	Five Guys , One Safe , No Brains	Despite its intriguing title , this film has nothing whatsoever to do with " Dark Shadows " ; Collinwood is an area in Cleveland , Ohio . Mainly , the film involves " down-and-out working stiffs " Sam Rockwell ( as Pero ) , Michael Jeter ( as Toto ) , Isaiah Washington ( as Leon ) , William H . Macy ( as Riley ) , and Andy Davoli ( as Basil ) . They plan " the BIG heist " - but things go comically wrong . Of the other players , George Clooney ( as Jerzy ) stands out - or , would that be sits out ? - as an expert the gang of five hires , for $500 , to learn safe-cracking . It's quite nice that Mr . Jeter's performance is a highlight , since this is one of his last . If only this comedy " re-make " of the Italian " I soliti ignoti " were funnier ?

453713	15896852	206314	5.0	Re-treading Lightly	Handsome California student Paul Walker ( as Lewis Thomas ) gets a break from college studying , and takes off in his new ( to him ) 1971 Chrysler Newport . In Salt Lake City , Utah , he springs his fun-loving , delinquent brother Steve Zahn ( as Fuller Thomas ) from jail . While on their way to pick up cute Boulder , Colorado coed Leelee Sobieski ( as Venna ) , the men hear a trucker named " Rusty Nail " on their CB radio . In a joke cooked up by Mr . Zahn , Mr . Walker pretends to be a sexy woman named " Candy Cane " ; and , he sets up a date with the horny " Rusty Nail " . Alas , the trucker can't take a joke , and decides to terrorize the travelers ! John Dahl's " Joy Ride " features some good locations and camera-work , which doesn't add up to as much as it should , due to the film's huge storyline familiarities ; it's sometimes suspenseful , and seldom scary . The lead character , and his likely complicated relationships with a troubled brother and potential girlfriend , come across as unusually bland . The intriguing " villain " ( well-voiced by Ted Levine ) is , also , not too intense . The earlier parts of the film are more interesting , and / or original ( the brothers in the hotel room , for example ) . The latter acts are less effective retreads . Notably , Walker and Zahn have a contrived public nude scene , courtesy of " Rusty Nail " . The " cornfield " part of " North by Northwest " is employed ; and , the old " gun and door " trick was used with more clarity and suspense by Thayer David ( as Count Petofi ) on " Dark Shadows " ( episode # 841 ) . Joy Ride ( 2001 ) John Dahl - Paul Walker , Steve Zahn , Leelee Sobieski
452989	15896852	37408	5.0	Two Girls , a Sailor , and a Variety Show	Extremely long World War II story about " Two Girls and a Sailor " ( portrayed by June Allyson , Gloria DeHaven , and Van Johnson ) . The threesome from the customary " love triangle " - will Sailor Johnson choose pert June Allyson or sexy Gloria DeHaven ? The film would be more accurately titled , " Two Girls , a Sailor , and a Variety Show " because the singing sisters aren't just shown at work - every act in their musical revue is shown . It's like a Musical spliced with a Variety Show ; and , it clocks in at over two hours without ever becoming anything more than low average . June Allyson , Jimmy Durante , Harry James , and Gracie Allen have fine moments ; and , it's nice to see " Inka Dinka Doo " and all of the other 1944 era acts preserved on film . Two Girls and a Sailor ( 1944 ) Richard Thorpe - June Allyson , Van Johnson , Gloria DeHaven
452505	15896852	37988	5.0	Sometimes Too Subtle & Sometimes Too Obvious	The story is familiar - Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray wishes his painting would grow old whilst he remain young . The sets , direction , and photography are beautiful . Through no fault of their own , the actors ' characters falter - for example ; Angela Lansbury is strikingly beautiful and terrific , but annoyingly sings " Goodbye Little Yellow Bird " ( foreshadowing ? ) , and Hurd Hatfield grows into the role , but annoyingly stabs a table ( more foreshadowing ? ) . Mr . Hatfield ends up impressing , but the film's early going makes it difficult . George Sanders is delicious , as usual . More often than not , the script is way too subtle . Why couldn't the frequent narration help explain things more mysterious , instead of things more obvious ? AND , the switching from " black and white " to " color " is a gimmick that almost worked the first time . The Picture of Dorian Gray ( 1945 ) Albert Lewin - Hurd Hatfield , George Sanders , Donna Reed
453582	15896852	1062	5.0	Hats Off to D . W . Griffith	Early film short directed by D . W . Griffith ; it might be more accurately called a " short short " at barely three minutes . It is entertaining , though . The director is saying , " Ladies , please remove your hats ! " Why ? Because you can't match a movie when some woman parks herself in front of your seat , and leaves her HUGE hat on . There are some early silent film stars in attendance - obviously Flora Finch , Linda Arvidson , and Florence Laurence . Mack Sennett is the man with the finny nose and the checkered suit . The men are not easy to identify , with their backs turned ; but , that must be Robert Harron in the lower right of your screen , going crazy over " Those Awful Hats " . The film really MOVES ? all the time , there is movement ALL OVER the screen . Ms . Arvidson recalled , in her autobiography , " How many times that scene was rehearsed and taken ! It grew so late and we were all so sleepy that we stopped counting . But pay for overtime evolved from this picture . " Those Awful Hats ( 1909 ) D . W .

452416	15896852	19558	6.0	In Apple Blossom Time	In Vienna , before The Great War ( aka World War I ) , dashing Erich von Stroheim ( as Nicki ) is a Prince with little family money ; therefore , parents George Fawcett and Maude George ( as Prince and Princess von Wildeliebe-Rauffenburg ) want their son to wed the wealthy , but crippled , Zasu Pitts ( as Cecelia ) . Mr . von Stroheim seems game ; though , obviously , he plans to continue bedding maids and other girlies . However , attending the " Corpus Christi " celebration , he meets impoverished beauty Fay Wray ( as Mitzi ) . And , for von Stroheim and Ms . Wray , it's love at first sight . As if matters weren't complicated enough for the mutually attracted pair , Wray has been promised to spitting butcher Mathew Betz ( as Schani ) . Will von Stroheim marry for love , or money ? " The Wedding March " is a very well-produced film , but Stroheim miscasts himself as the romantic young " love child " ; and , he takes more than a little getting used to . When Wray falls in love with him , Stroheim recalls , all decked out , the cruel " Iron Man " knight which helps open the film . By the end , this appears to have been intentional . The film is , also , way too lengthy ; while possessing some lovely images , it drowns itself in a sea of apple blossoms . The soft focus lens is unnecessarily excessive on Wray's beautiful , young face . The actresses perform very well ( Wray , Pitts and George ) ; and the photography , including a color segment by Ray Rennahan , is luxurious .
453573	15896852	30491	6.0	Bonita Granville Suspects Fowl Play	The " Brinwood School for Young Ladies " is buzzing about the arrival of wealthy sponsor Helena Phillips Evans ( as Mary Eldredge ) . Pretty teenage sleuth Bonita Granville ( as Nancy Drew ) and the girls hope the woman's offer of $250 , 000 will be used to install a swimming pool . When the elderly woman disappears just before making the donation , Ms . Granville suspects foul play . Her father , lawyer John Litel ( as Carson Drew ) , and others try to veer Granville of the case ; but , she is determined to find the missing woman . Granville enlists help from young wavy-haired neighbor Frankie Thomas ( as Ted Nickerson ) . The " Carolyn Keene " characters were unfamiliar to this commenter , but this certainly seems like a satisfactory adaptation . Granville , who made an impression in " These Three " ( 1936 ) , is an attractive , determined , intelligent , and charming heroine . Unlike most early " teen " stars , Granville appears natural and endearing , even with expressions like " I'll bet you $23 . 80 " and " I should say not ! " Mr . Thomas , who made an impression in " Wednesday's Child " ( 1934 ) , is similarly appealing and unaffected , for a 1930s movie juvenile . Thomas says " Let's keep it clean " and makes the " drag " scene . " Nancy Drew - Detective " shows how well a " small " genre film can be done . Granville and Thomas make a cute team . Nancy Drew - Detective ( 1938 ) William Clemens - Bonita Granville , Frankie Thomas , John Litel
452979	15896852	215750	6.0	All Quite on the Russian Front	It's 1942 , and the Russians are brutalized by the Nazi Army at Stalingrad . Still , the Russian resisters proclaim , " Never will the enemy put his foot on the soil of Stalingrad ! " Sharp-shooting soldier Jude Law ( as Vassili Zaitsev ) meets , and bonds with , commissar comrade Joseph Fiennes ( as Danilov ) . Mr . Fiennes , who survives massacre by playing possum , is very impressed with Mr . Law's sniper fire . Law had been firing between the eyes since his days as a shepherd boy . After losing several Germans to Law's bullets , the Nazis send their own Major sharpshooter , Ed Harris ( as König ) , out to bag Law . Meanwhile , Law and Fiennes form the obligatory " love triangle " with fetching Rachel Weisz ( as Tania ) . Jean-Jacques Annaud directs big production values well enough , and the story's setting is a refreshing change from the usual western-fronted World War II epics . But , the whole thing collapses under its unnecessary , and startlingly ordinary " love triangle " . Law and Ms . Weisz are the main lovey-dovey duo . Their love-making scene may remind you about . . . well , not waking up the roommate . Duplicitous chocolate-loving young Gabriel Thomson ( as Sasha ) and Mr . Harris portray somewhat more interesting supporting characters . Enemy at the Gates ( 2001 ) - Jude Law , Joseph Fiennes , Rachel Weisz
453056	15896852	54988	6.0	Something Is Rotten in Denmark	Obviously intended to frighten , director William Castle's psycho trip , instead , amuses . Joan Marshall ( as Emily ) ' s homicidal performance may be unconvincing on a technical level ; but , she performs it endearingly , and with a straight face . Glenn Corbett ( as Karl ) and Patricia Breslin ( as Miriam ) are an attractive vis a vis . And , Eugenie Leontovich ( as Helga ) is a " knock-out " ( note : stroke victims may want to see what else is on ) . Don't miss the beginning , when Ms . Marshall propositions handsome bellhop Richard Rust for marriage , but not sex , then loses control on her wedding day . Also , enjoy Burnett Guffey's photography . " Homicidal " screams out for a TV-movie or home video remake , with the " fight break " replaced by a " bathroom break " .

452494	15896852	32143	6.0	Putting The Women in Their Place	After Norma Shearer ( as Mary ) discovers her husband is having an affair with Joan Crawford ( as Crystal ) , she learns women must not be proud . Rosalind Russell ( as Sylvia ) leads an MGM parade of supporting players - all women ; in fact , only women appear in the film ! But , don't expect a " feminist " statement from George Cukor's " The Women " . The message may waver , but it never really gets too far away from putting women in their place . If the film is about anything other than being faithful and subservient to your man , it's about gossip . It could have been titled " Gossip " . What's appealing about " The Women " is enjoying some of its fine , albeit dated , dialog and situations . There are scores of actresses to watch ; Ms . Shearer and Ms . Russell come off best , but appreciators of any will like their favorites . Ms . Crawford likes to smoke in her bathtub . The film's fun is severely weakened by an extremely distracting interlude - the " Fashion Show " - which is presented in COLOR . " Gimmicks " like the color segment and the all female cast ruin " The Women " ; and , the acceptance of a " double standard " for men and women is presented as part of a great woman's character .

452699	15896852	55304	6.0	Steele Away	This retains much of the " House of Usher " glow , but is too repetitive ( of the earlier film ) , and loses story focus . It's really one short story - the ending , basically , stretched way out to feature film length . I didn't like the flashbacks - with the camera lens going down to brick size ( foreshadowy , though ) . They seemed only to pad the film , and didn't expand my knowledge of character motivation . I think the script was sloppily written , with the viewer left to explain away horrific plot holes , like : Who was buried in wife's tomb ? AND - Why oh why couldn't they let Barbara Steele scream " Let Me Out ! LET ME OUT ! " at the end ? Still , more fun than not .

453726	15896852	743195	6.0	Duke and the Preacher	As the Wagon Train moves , Duke ( Denny Miller ) is out scouting the terrain . Meanwhile , traveling preacher Franchot Tone ( as Malachi Hobart ) settles down to camp for the night . Duke , afoot due to problems with his saddle , is relieved to encounter Mr . Tone , who shares his food and campfire with the younger man . Tone ministers , " We are all brothers under the sky . " In the morning , Tone fixes Duke's saddle . Duke leaves very impressed , and perhaps naively enthralled , with the charismatic preacher . Before re-joining the Wagon Train , Duke visits feisty old Irene Ryan ( as Martha Gresham ) ; and , he learns her boozing husband has drowned . When a sobered-up Wally Brown ( as George Gresham ) turns up alive , Duke learns the old couple were bilked out of $300 . 00 by Tone , who is revealed a fraud . Duke decides to find the unholy minister ; pretending to be a friend , he invites Tone to join the Wagon Train ? The resulting dramatics may be predictable ; but , they are deftly handled , by writer Ken Kolb and the Wagon train crew . Train master Chris Hale ( John McIntire ) takes a back seat , as the episode focuses on Mr . Miller's attractive " Duke " character . Miller performs well with veteran Tone , who performs marvelously as the bilking preacher . Tone explains , " I tell people what they want to hear . I revive their faith in miracles . " Ms . Ryan and Mr . Brown are noteworthy among the typically fine supporting players . After this appearance , Ryan began her successful episodic career as " Granny " on " The Beverly Hillbillies " . Conversely , Brown's career was over ; he died shortly before this episode aired . It must have been startling to see his character " come back from the dead " ; still , his appearance in " The Malachi Hobart Story " is served by a coincidently reverential tone . The script affirms the characters ' ( Christian ) faith . The Malachi Hobart Story ( / 62 ) David Butler - Franchot Tone , Denny Miller , John McIntire

Granville , looking more and more curvaceous , enlists the aid of young wavy-haired neighbor Frankie Thomas ( as Ted Nickerson ) , who looks swell in boxing trunks .

453048	15896852	9976	6.0	A Baseball Hit for Charles Ray	Charles Ray ( as Benjamin " Ben " Harding ) is a country boy who loves baseball ; he's the pride of small town Brownsville . His sweetheart , Colleen Moore ( as Mazie Palmer ) , has a batting average of 1 , 000 in Mr . Ray's affection - however , he barely gets to first base ! John " Jack " Gilbert ( as Jim Blair ) is a rival for Ms . Moore's affections ; he is not only a heel , with a tendency to drink and gamble - Mr . Gilbert is also more well-heeled , being a banker's son . When St . Paul Pink Sox , a big league team , is stranded in Brownsville , Ray gets to strut his stuff ; then , he is offered a major league spot . Will success spoil Ben Harding ? Ray is convincing as " The Busher " , displaying the little mannerisms which made him so successful in this type of part . His face and body movements expertly portray the " innocent country boy " type . He says , " Gosh ! " . Entering a social , he pats his hair down with a licked hand . His performance at the " Box Social " is charming - at this occasion , the men " bid " on women they can only see as shadows behind a screen . Moore and Gilbert are fine in the supporting roles ; both would become major 1920s stars . The St . Paul Pink Sox ? It might have been a combination of the Boston Red and White Sox . Ray's curve ball nicely strikes out into one of the title cards , and that " Box Social " sure looked fun . It's difficult to believe a major league baseball team considers you finished after one bad game , though ; if that were true , there would be no baseball .

The group includes Mr . Bacon's beautiful ex-girlfriend Elisabeth Shue ( as Linda McKay ) , and her handsome new bed partner Josh Brolin ( as Matt Kensington ) . After successfully making a gorilla ( " Isabelle " ) invisible , and bringing her back to the " seen " world , Bacon decides it's time for a human to take the invisibility plunge . Bacon swallows the serum , and becomes an invisible man . . . " What would you do if you knew you couldn't be seen ? " asks Kim Dickens ( as Sarah Kennedy ) . Good idea . An updated , darker " Invisible Man " - with Kevin Bacon as the title character , and fantastic special effects - is ruined by a truly absurd storyline . The side effects of Twinkies are astonishing . And , you won't believe the healing powers of Duct Tape . For what it's worth , the scenes with Greg Grunberg ( as Carter Abbey ) show the subject of voyeurism handled well . As usual , Bacon is game . Finally , Rhona Mitra is an eyeful , as Bacon's busty neighbor . Hollow Man ( 2000 ) Paul Verhoeven - Kevin Bacon , Elisabeth Shue , Josh Brolin
452754	15896852	2199	7.0	Crossing the Water	In Palestine , a virgin named Mary ( Gene Gauntier ) is visited by one of God's angels ; subsequently , she becomes pregnant . Meanwhile , an angel of God invites Joseph , a son of David , to wed Mary . The angel explains that Mary's child is the savior Jesus Christ , who will grow up to save his people from their sins . The child grows up without fanfare ; but , as an adult ( Robert Henderson-Bland ) , Christ assembles disciples , and begins performing miracles . He is persecuted for his beliefs ; and , finally , he is crucified . For its time , a very good version of the often told story of Jesus Christ . Director Sidney Olcott and photographer George Hollister do very well ; their scenes with Mary , Joseph , and young Jesus in Egypt are a beautiful example . It's nice to see the scenes with Jesus as a child ; and , note the one where he carries a stick of lumber foreshadows the crucifixion . Mr . Henderson-Bland acts the part very well ; he is subdued , and looks comfortable in the role . Ms . Gauntier , who assisted Mr . Olcott greatly throughout the production , was certainly the film's most valuable player . The miracles scenes are very silly looking , and acted ; although , to be honest , I haven't seen enough people " raised from the dead " to judge the antics on screen . The " walking on water " might have worked if the water was a little calmer . There should have been more story explanation given for it , but the crucifixion elicited passion . Not the first " feature " film , but an important one ; for its lovely Egypt , Palestine , and Ireland location scenes . " From the Manger to the Cross " is the peak production from the early " Kalem " film company . Notably , it omits the resurrection ( some versions add it , from another film ) .

Vain , selfish , and very attractive ; Ms . Davis prefers to string her suitors along . During one cocktail hour gathering , Davis discovers her ne'er-do-well brother Richard Waring ( as Trippy Trellis ) has been embezzling funds from Jewish banker Claude Rains ( as Job Skeffington ) . To shield her beloved brother from prosecution , Davis endeavors to wed the ultra-wealthy Mr . Rains . Rains , like most men , has worshiped Davis from afar ; but , she is unable to change her coquettish lifestyle . " The most difficult aspect of the character Fanny was ( that ) she was a famous beauty of her day , " Davis observed , " I was far from being beautiful . " Yet , Davis , with her strength of personality and acting prowess , pulls off the role ; she is , as always , a great one to watch . Rains also performs well ; but , his is more of a supporting role , despite playing the title role . Walter Abel ( as George Trellis ) gets a lot of good camera time , also . And , George Coulouris is exceptional , as Davis ' astute psychoanalyst . " Mr . Skeffington " is a relatively long film , in its " restored " length . Davis and Rains were nominated for " Academy Awards " in the " Best Actress " and " Supporting Actor " categories . The film might have been cited for its decade spanning make-up work , if the category had existed back then . Mr . Skeffington ( 1944 ) Vincent Sherman - Bette Davis , Claude Rains , Walter Abel
453389	15896852	43625	7.0	John Garfield's Last Shot	After a heist goes wrong , cop killer John Garfield ( as Nick Robey ) is on the run . Taking cover in a public swimming pool , Mr . Garfield meets plain Shelley Winters ( as Peg Dobbs ) . Flattery gets him everywhere ; and , Garfield uses Ms . Winters for getaway cover . Starved for the manly affection , Winters mistakes his advances for interest . Soon , Winters has Garfield in her apartment , to meet the family . When he feels the police closing in , Garfield holds up in Winters ' apartment , holding the family hostage . Desperate hours ensue ? It's difficult to understand Winters ' continued naivety ; and , the " family held hostage " plot doesn't ring quite true . Still , Garfield's paranoia , and Winters ' character development make it well worth watching . Sadly , this was Garfield's final film ; he died within a year , at age 39 . Director John Berry and photographer James Wong Howe make it look great . " He Ran All the Way " boasts a fine supporting cast , led by Wallace Ford . And , the ending grows with an exciting , thought-provoking intensity .

Next , the bandits force the train passengers to lineup , and loot their valuables . Meanwhile , the railroad operator has recovered , and rounds up a posse ; then , they go after the robbers ? A landmark Edwin S . Porter film , with future western star Gilbert M . " Broncho Billy " Anderson . The lasting image , and film highlight , however , is Justin D . Barnes firing away , in the film's closing seconds . It still packs a punch , since the final shot is so unexpectedly different from the rest of the film .
453043	15896852	18097	7.0	From Beyond the Unknown	As of October 20 , 2007 , " London After Midnight " is a lost film - there is no known surviving footage . Hopefully , a print or portion will be discovered . Until then , TCM's 2002 reconstruction , by Rick Schmidlin , will have to suffice - it was created by referencing the original script and utilizing movie photograph still . Robert Israel provided a representative musical score . Cheers to all involved ! Before viewing the restoration by Mr . Schmidlin , consider watching the other Tod Browning ( director ) , Lon Cheney ( actor ) , and Merritt B . Gerstad ( cameraman ) collaboration " The Unknown " ( 1927 ) ; it may provide the best indication of how " London After Midnight " might have looked on the motion picture screen . Then , see Browning's re-make " Mark of the Vampire " ( 1935 ) ; its script closely follows " London After Midnight " , and it will help explain some story elements limited by the movie stills available . I'm speculating the performances of Lon Chaney ( as Prof . Edward Burke ) and Henry B . Walthall ( as Sir James Hamlin ) were noteworthy , but the story disappointing . Conrad Nagel ( as Arthur Hibbs ) must have been very impressive ; he would shortly co-star with none other than Greta Garbo , in 1928 and 1929 films . And , certainly , Marceline Day was lovely ( as Lucille Balfour ) . London After Midnight ( 1927 ) Tod Browning - Lon Chaney , Henry B . Walthall , Conrad Nagel
453415	15896852	649	7.0	Robert Harron Makes an Impression	Historically important as Robert Harron's first starring feature , " Bobby's Kodak " ( February 10 , 1908 ) also features Biograph cameraman G . W . Bitzer . It was directed by Wallace McCutcheon . Mr . Harron started playing " bit " parts at the studio in late 1907 as an after school job , with future film editor James Smith . Collaborator D . W . Griffith had yet to arrive . " Jim and I were earning five dollars a week , " Harron recalled in a February 8 , 1920 newspaper interview with Louella Parsons , " At that time , five dollars was considered a big salary for a boy . We were proud of ourselves until we started playing regular parts . And then , we used to hold indignation meetings , and say if the company didn't realize our value , we would leave ; a threat which never worried anyone , and which we never carried out . " Happily , the boys stayed with Biograph , and met director Griffith the following year ; thus , with Mr . Bitzer , the ingredients for movie magic were stirred . Unhappily , " Bobby's Kodak " is a lost film . Here is Harron's synopsis : " ' Bobby's Kodak ' was the title . I was the infant terrible , and I snapped my father kissing the maid , mother flirting with the butler , the nurse maid having an affair with the cop . Later , I showed all the pictures ; and , the pandemonium that followed has some of our best slapstick comedies looking lifeless . There was a chase - Edward Dillon played my father , and it was from his irate grasp I had to escape . " Bobby's Kodak ( 1908 ) Wallace McCutcheon - Robert Harron , Edward Dillon
453336	15896852	29844	7.0	Tears Along the Mississippi	Mark Twain's classic characters are brought back to life , by David O . Selznick , for an updated movie adaptation . For the first time , Tom and Huck are seen in color ( specifically , " Technicolor " ) , which contributes to the film's main strength : it looks storybook beautiful . The reliance on set pieces seems entirely appropriate , giving the film great style ; and , they are very well done . The cinematography , by James Wong Howe , is remarkable . The story wavers from true triumph , however , in the direction of the characters ; the " cuteness quotient " is set far too high . Many tears flow . Tommy Kelly ( as Tom Sawyer ) suffers the most , of course , being the lead player . It should be emphasized , however , that this is not due to his effort ; under the circumstances , Mr . Kelly performs well . Jackie Moran ( as Huckleberry Finn ) is a cute best friend ; but , not much like the " Huck " from Twain's book . Ann Gillis ( as Becky Thatcher ) is a cute girl friend . The players are all good , but May Robson ( as Aunt Polly ) seems the truest . While more cute than mischievous , and far too clean , " The Adventures of Tom Sawyer " is good enough to stand on its own . The familiar " lost in the caves " ending is a great climax ; and , Victor Jory ( as Injun Joe ) still startles . The scene of " Tom " emerging , at last , from the caves - - his black silhouette shot against the blue sky of freedom - - is indelible .

Although the film is suggestively titled " Street Girl " , Ms . Compson avoids dabbling in the world's oldest profession . Instead , Compson hooks up with attractive John Harron ( as Mike Fall ) , who is so taken with briefly homeless Compson , he asks her to move in with his jazzy musical group . As " The Four Seasons " , Mr . Harron's " Mike Fall " is teamed with Jack Oakie ( as Joe Spring ) , Ned Sparks ( as Happy Winter ) , and Guy Buccola ( as Pete Summer ) . Compson , conveniently a violinist , joins " The Four Seasons " both at home and on stage . The group is lively and likable ; especially , the smiling Mr . Oakie , in his spring . The " Seasons " become successful , and romance blooms for Compson and Harron ; but , a visiting Prince threatens the duo's happiness . . . Compson , who was at an artistic peak around the time silent films found their voice , tends to be a little too theatrical in " Street Girl " , her starring vehicle ; she certainly proves her versatility on the screen , however . Leading man Harron gives director / co-producer Wesley Ruggles the film's best acting performance ; he ( perhaps unfairly ) certainly makes you wonder what heights deceased brother Bobby Harron might have reached in the " talkies " . The early Oscar Levant music ( with lyrics by Sidney Clare ) is very good . Gus Arnheim " and His Coconut Grove Ambassadors " skillfully dubbed their instrumentals ; apparently , this is before future star Fred MacMurray joined the group . The frequently heard " Loveable and Sweet " is considered a jazz classic , in the cover version expertly recorded by Annette Hanshaw with the Dorsey Brothers . Although the early " RKO Radio Picture " production is more than a little rough around the edges , the musical / comedy genre storyline is solid .

452538	15896852	164181	7.0	Kevin Bacon's Second Sight	Blue-collar lineman Kevin Bacon ( as Tom Witzky ) would have rather become a rock musician . Instead , Mr . Bacon has settled for a more ordinary life . He has just moved to a modest Chicago house , in a " decent " neighborhood . Bacon , and sexily pregnant wife Kathryn Erbe ( as Maggie Witzky ) have a mildly creepy ( but innocent looking ) young son , Zachary David Cope ( as Jake Witzky ) . Young Cope can see , and talk to , dead people . Ms . Erbe looks good in denim . She has a witchy sister , Illeana Douglas ( as Lisa Weil ) , who gets the story going , after hypnotizing Bacon into seeing dead people , too ? David Koepp's " Stir of Echoes " is a mostly effective ghost story . Bacon and the cast are terrific . Thankfully , the focus is on Bacon's protagonist , rather than kid Cody , who does not ( also , thankfully ) portray the usual annoying devil movie tot . The story is intriguing , well-paced , and nicely detailed . The " aborted kidnapping " of Cody , and " foreshadowed suicide " of Chalon Williams ( as Adam ) are two highlights . The story starts to falter when Erbe goes to find mysterious Eddie Bo Smith ( as Neil ) ; you expect the film to advance to a higher level , but the sequence ends up giving away too much . Dig it . For the " Talk About Good Taste " department : Bacon searches for the lost chords of the Rolling Stones ' " Paint it Black " ( a great version is sound-tracked , by Gob ) . Cody can't get George Romero's " Night of the Living Dead " off of his television set . And , babysitter Liza Weil ( as Debbie Kozac ) reads dog-eared paperback writer Richard Matheson's incredible " Shrinking Man " .

453520	15896852	10103	7.0	The Eyes of Clara Are Upon You	Clara Kimball Young ( as Gina Ashling ) is at a crossroads in her life - - she has a promising operatic voice , and is invited to pursue a career in Paris ; her family , however , wants her to remain at home and help support the family . She is also being courted by a wealthy man ; however , she does not love him , and would only be marrying for financial security . ENTER a disciple from the East - - the spiritual-type Hindu ( played by Vincent Serrano , he is introduced in the film's opening ) ; he arrives to show Ms . Kimball Young his Crystal Ball - - in which she sees her future . This is an impressively mounted silent film production , with a great cast , and an ambitious story structure . The mysterious Hindu man's crystal ball provides heroine Kimball Young ( and movie viewers ) the opportunity to " see " three different future scenarios : In " The Path of Duty " she stays with the family and becomes a schoolteacher . In " The Path of Ambition " she pursues her operatic singing career . In " The Path of Wealth " she marries for money and security . You may believe a Hindu can show Kimball Young the future in a crystal ball - - but , some of the unfolding events , and choices , strain credulity . Schoolteachers and career-women are wretched creatures ! Kimball Young's performance is the film's highlight . She is not consistently great ; but , her best scenes are enough to explain her status as one of the decade's top actresses . For example , in a " Duty " scene , she checks her aged appearance in a mirror effectively . Her best work occurs in the film's final " Wealth " segment - - incredibly , she transforms herself into a gaunt , drug-addicted street-walker . The scenes with the desolate Kimball Young walking rain-drenched streets are convincing , and artful . Director Albert Parker and Kimball Young are assisted by a fine supporting cast - - the Ashling family includes brother Gareth Hughes , sister Pauline Starke , and father Sam Southern . Kimball Young's suitors include Milton Sills , Edmund Lowe , and Ralph Lewis - - all performing well . The most notable supporting player , in hindsight , is Rudolph Valentino as smarmy " Cabaret Parasite " Clarence Morgan ; he further elevates the film's fine " Path of Wealth " segment . Valentino watchers should note he appears about 50 minutes into the production . Eyes of Youth ( / 19 ) Albert Parker - Clara Kimball Young , Edmund Lowe , Rudolph Valentino
452359	15896852	47849	8.0	Stranger in Town	Spencer Tracy is an old one-armed man who goes to town in " Bad Day at Black Rock " . He wants to give a medal to an old war buddy's father ( who saved his life ) . I was a little confused by this backstory ; I wondered why everyone didn't just tell Mr . Tracy his friend's father passed away . Now , that I think about it , I'm sure the filmmakers must have wanted us to think Tracy's character was much younger . That , and one of Tracy's almost super-human feats , are the film's major flaws . Otherwise , it's great . Tracy's performance carried the film - he is an immediate visual intrusion on this old western-style town ; instead of western gear , he wears a regular suit . Although it's a dark suit , Tracy's performance relays the fact that he is the " good guy " . John Sturges does an excellent job directing ; I've seen the Sturges credit on a number of films , and believe this may be his best . Robert Ryan and the citizens of Black Rock work very well indeed with Sturges and Tracy . This is a film I'm looking forward to seeing again .

453286	15896852	61385	8.0	Dancing Barefoot	Jane Fonda ( she's Corie ) and Robert Redford ( he's Paul ) are a deliriously happy newlywed couple who begin their wedded days in a modest five-flight high New York City walk-up apartment . Her mother , Mildred Natwick , is their most frequent visitor ; she becomes involved with neighbor in the attic Charles Boyer . This film is a BIG improvement over Ms . Fonda's previous New York City situation comedies " Sunday in New York " ( 1963 ) and " Any Wednesday " ( 1966 ) . The " situation " isn't sexual ( it's mainly the apartment ) , and the material is much better . Fonda and Mr . Redford are fine , and supporters Ms . Natwick and Mr . Boyer are a delight to watch . You can't help but wonder : how are all these people exhausted by five flights , with the possible exception of Boyer ? I also worried , more than laughed , about Natwick falling . Still , " Barefoot in the Park " is a well-done comedy with a satisfying ending . If you are familiar with the 1966-1971 TV program " Dark Shadows " , watch Redford's performance closely . He reminded me of Joel Crothers ' role of " Joe Haskell " . Both Redford and Crothers played Neil Simon's " Paul " on Broadway , and I would say Mr . Crothers brought some of that character to his role on " Dark Shadows " . Barefoot in the Park ( 1967 ) Gene Saks - Jane Fonda , Robert Redford , Mildred Natwick
453291	15896852	41716	8.0	New York , New York ! ( It's a Wonderful Town )	Three sailors spend their 24-hour shore leave looking for women in New York City . Gene Kelly ( he's Gabey ) finds Vera-Ellen ( she's Ivy ) , Betty Garrett ( she's Brunhilde ) finds Frank Sinatra ( he's Chip ) , and Jules Mushin ( he's Ozzie ) finds Ann Miller ( she's Claire ) . The movie opens with the extraordinary production number " New York ! New York ! " , with the Kelly , Sinatra , and Mushin trio dancing and singing all over New York City . It's one of the best musical introductions ever , and the New York City location footage is exquisite . You should know that , while the film is classy and energetic throughout , it never again even approaches the high standard exhibited in the opening . The exuberance is enough to sustain the film for some time - how long will depend on individual tastes . On the Town ( 1949 ) Gene Kelly , Stanley Donen - Gene Kelly , Frank Sinatra , Ann Miller
453182	15896852	21542	8.0	All Quiet on the Westfront 1918	It is incredible that the U . S . and Germany , in between two Great World Wars , would simultaneously produce two very similarly-themed films - this one , and " All Quiet on the Western Front " ( 1930 ) . The sounds of war are eerily alike - relentless , disturbing , horrifying ? " Westfront 1918 " is less drama , and more documentary-style than its cousin . The war scenes are remarkable ; but so is an interlude when Gustav Diessl ( as Karl ) goes on leave , expertly directed by G . W . Pabst . This part is slightly better than the Lew Ayres ( as Paul ) leave in " All Quiet on the Western Front " ; and , it is more realistic . However , " Westfront 1918 " is less memorable in its final " emotion grabbing " scene ( and , overall ) . Still , it's an excellent film . Westfront 1918 ( 1930 ) G . W .

453472	15896852	18054	8.0	If I Were a Carpenter	Cecil B . De Mille's EPIC " The King of Kings " is his New Testament follow-up to the Old Testament EPIC " The Ten Commandments " ( 1923 ) . These films are better than their sound-era re-makes ; their lack of spoken dialog makes them seem more reverent , somehow . DeMille even promises this , " play ( is ) a reverent part in the spirit of ( Christ's ) great command . " To introduce his version of Jesus Christ ( H . B . Warner ) , " The King of Kings " heals a blind girl - as the girl opens her eyes , Mr . Warner becomes the Christian sin-savior . It's one of many marvelous bits of film-making . For its time , this was a very artistic , well-produced film . In a foreword to accompany this picture , DeMille wrote , " At no time in the world's history has humanity so hungered for the Truth . Science has declared there is a God . And a groping , eager World cries , ' How may we find Him ? ' The answer goes back two thousand years , to a Man who stood with a little band of ragged followers in the midst of bigotry , cruelty and ignorance - lighting with the torch of His own life the flame of hope in the heart of man and showing us by sublime Sacrifice - Death and Resurrection - our own Immortality . " DeMille takes liberties with the story , but doesn't waver too far from what could have happened in the lives of the characters . For example , since the affairs of Mary Magdalene ( Jacqueline Logan ) aren't explicitly documented , DeMille ( with writer Jeanie Macpherson ) creates one , to introduce and move the story along . With a prominently jeweled bust , Ms . Logan's " Mary " meets Christ after learning her lover , Judas Iscariot ( Joseph Schildkraut ) , is spending too much time with the Divine one . But , in casting an older man as Christ , DeMille helps avoid possibly making Christ appear too erotic . The film benefits from some story tinkering ; however , it still plays like a series of stilted vignettes - most of the time . One of the more memorable moments occurs when a girl asks Christ to " heal " her doll's broken leg . This simple scene stands out , due to its lack of miraculous content . The " special effects " highlight in " King of Kings " is the rollicking crucifixion ; and , like " Ten Commandments " , some color footage is included . Watch closely , and you'll see the character " Judas " steal the picture ; and , overall , Mr . Schildkraut's hanging disciple is the film's most memorable character .

453226	15896852	57197	8.0	Gods and Monsters	In order to claim his rightful throne , Todd Armstrong ( as Jason ) must find the legendary Golden Fleece ; the assembled " Jason and the Argonauts " assume the quest , but are stymied by a series of monstrous obstacles . Behind the scenes , the Greek Gods ( led by Zeus and Hera ) are fighting over the mission's outcome . The heroic Mr . Armstrong also catches the eyes of mortals Gary Raymond ( as Acastus ) and Nancy Kovack ( as Medea ) , but ? for different reasons . Ray Harryhausen's special effects are outstanding ; especially noteworthy are the dueling skeletons near the film's end - - and , the " stop motion animation " is excellent throughout . The skeleton sequence , and others , like the statue of Talos " coming-to-life " , are classic . Armstrong portrays the hero " Jason " handsomely , while Nancy Kovack ( as Medea ) and Honor Blackman ( as Hera ) add feminine charm . Don Chaffey ( director ) and Bernard Herrmann ( musician ) also excel . The supporting cast and crew is stronger than you'd expect in a film of this type ; Mr . Raymond is the best supporting actor , with his clear , focused characterization of " Acastus " . Raymond's underrated performance provides some unexpected dramatic tension - - note how he calculatingly observes Armstrong , catching both the hero and the viewer off-guard . Jason and the Argonauts ( 1963 ) Don Chaffey - Todd Armstrong , Gary Raymond , Nancy Kovack
453376	15896852	20269	8.0	When Love Comes Stealing	London " Piccadilly Club " proprietor Jameson Thomas ( as Valentine Wilmot ) is having an affair with the female half of his star dancing duo " Mabel and Vic " , shimmying Gilda Gray ( as Mabel " Mab " Greenfield ) . When Ms . Gray's dancing partner gets too amorous with his lady love , Mr . Thomas fires the man . Alas , the departing Cyril Ritchard ( as Victor " Vic " Smiles ) was the nightclub duo's main attraction , and business tanks . But , Thomas has discovered a new dancer in his kitchen , sexy scullery maid Anna May Wong ( as Shosho ) . Ms . Wong becomes an immediate sensation . Older Gray feels put out , especially when Thomas slips easily into the younger Wong's arms . Eventually , passion leads to murder . Director E . A . Dupont and photographer Werner Brandes are superb , in their final collaboration ; they give " Piccadilly " a great , artful style . Wong's performance , the last of her " silent " career , is almost revelatory ; and , it's at least " Supporting Actress " award-worthy . Higher-billed Gray handles her less flattering role well , too . And , Thomas meets Wong's subtlety in wonderful ways ; catch him admiring Wong's torn stockings . Small bits of business , like Mr . Ritchard slitting a deeper crease into his hat , suggest additional eroticism . Charles Laughton has a delicious cameo as a " Piccadilly Club " patron more interested in his food than the dancers . The film is not without its sour notes , however ; for example , some characterizations / relationships are poorly defined ; and , the ending could have been better . However , any attempt to improve " Piccadilly " might have encouraged the producers to fix things that weren't broken . Even the fly crawling up Wong's left arm as she reclines , during a seduction scene , seems magically planned .
453283	15896852	29604	8.0	All About Kate	Katharine Hepburn moves in with Ginger Rogers at a boarding house for ( mostly ) would-be actresses . Soon we meet the many women in the boarding house , and become involved in their hopes , friendships and competitions . . . This is a very busy film . We are introduced to many characters and situations , it's sometimes difficult to focus on the story . It's the revolving door of stardom ( one star dies , another is born ) , centering around the relationship between Ms . Hepburn and Ms . Rogers ( mainly ) and the rest ( complimenting the leads and the theme ) . The film's many other performers are distracting ? there are so many stars to watch . Eve Arden comes on with a cat and I don't know what else just happened ! I had to read the IMDb comments , and watch this one twice , to make sure I didn't miss anything .

452876	15896852	44837	8.0	Limelight is a Cruel Lover	Charlie Chaplin moves into the 1950s with an unusual drama about an alcoholic old timer ( Chaplin as Calvero ) and suicidal young ballerina ( Claire Bloom as Terry ) . The comedian " Calvero " is drunk as the film opens , and obviously in the twilight of his career . He rescues Ms . Bloom from a suicide attempt and helps her to get back on her feet ( so to speak ) . The film seems almost like nothing , but becomes quite substantial . It's a very thoughtful film - - obviously , Chaplin in his 60s has lost none of his film-making skills : the difference is that you come to Chaplin on His terms . No longer interested ( capable ? ) of producing massive audience " hits " , Chaplin produces an indulgent , sentimental " Limelight " . It's an excellent work , but very hard to digest . Some impressions : Comedy is ballet . Life is ballet . Young needs old . Old needs young . Comics need a drug . Perhaps the film needs a single focus ? I found the sequences where Chaplin is told by the " suits " he's washed-up to be most memorable ; along with the small scene where a comic goes in for Chaplin's job because he's heard the old clown is awful . The stuff with Buster Keaton is very nice , too , and makes you wish the would have done a full film together . I believe Keaton's role makes the film deliberately less autobiographical than many would believe , but you can never be sure ? Chaplin is interesting to watch always ; when he seems to be doing nothing , he's not . Limelight ( 1952 ) Charles Chaplin - Charlie Chaplin , Claire Bloom , Buster Keaton
453370	15896852	55489	8.0	The Pleasure of His Company	Tennessee Williams ' tale of sexual repression in a small Mississippi town makes it to the big screen , with enough , but not all , of its integrity intact ; most notably , it glistens when it should sweat . Geraldine Page ( as Alma Winemiller ) is excellent as the minister's daughter who guiltily longs for rakish playboy Laurence Harvey ( as John Buchanan Jr . ) . Ms . Page's characterization is one that unravels ; its full impact realized is in a devastating last act . Mr . Harvey does well , successfully conveying the near-equal importance of his character . Page gives Harvey spiritual love , and he wants her physically ; their reversal of desire is very convincingly , and thoughtfully , portrayed . Excellent supporting performances are highlighted by crazed Una Merkel ( as Mother Winemiller ) and lonely Earl Holliman ( as Archie Kramer ) . If the film seems a little too staged , remember , it is Tennessee Williams ; a staged atmosphere is pardonable when your fluttering heroine speaks lines like , " The wind is penetrating this afternoon . " ( A decade earlier , Page played the role on stage . ) Elmer Bernstein's soundtrack is lovely . Music , performance , and dialogue give " Summer and Smoke " an appropriately sexually-charged atmosphere . Toss thoughts of blasphemy to the wind , and turn OFF the color ( if you can ) , to watch " Summer and Smoke " in mood-altering grayish tones . Summer and Smoke ( 1961 ) Peter Glenville - Geraldine Page , Laurence Harvey , Una Merkel
453475	15896852	110632	9.0	A Red-Blooded American Man and Woman	In 1994 , Oliver Stone held a mirror up to the face of America's preoccupation with mindless violence , and most recoiled in disgust . It was a good sign ! Alas , the obsession remains ; and , with a few twists and turns unforeseen in Mr . Stone's film . Perhaps , it won't end until a " reality show " films an actual " Mickey and Mallory Knox " in action . Until then , " Natural Born Killers " gives the lowest common dominator exactly what they won't admit they desire : " The gory details . " Thankfully , Stone and his skillful crew depict the violence in an artful , poetic , and ( sometimes ) humorous manner . Violent or not , it is an excellent piece of film-making . Stone , with photographer Robert Richardson , uses film types and techniques in an extraordinarily powerful way ; the differing styles are a relevant enhancement of the story , rather than a catalog of gimmicks . Stone brilliantly captures 1990s TV media ( and beyond ) . In particular , Robert Downey Jr . ' s portrayal of an Australian Geraldo Rivera-type interviewer " Wayne Gale " is a dead-on treasure . This type of interviewer peddles the perverse as entertainment ; and , with viewers ratings , turns " folks " like Charles Manson , Bonnie , and Clyde into celebrity stars . A decade later , Chris Hansen's " To Catch a Predator " proved media could sink even lower , by celebrating pedophilia . Woody Harrelson and Juliet Lewis are individually chilling and brave , in the lead roles ; somehow , they aren't as memorable together as other criminal and / or degenerate couples ( " Bonnie and Clyde " , " Sid and Nancy " ) . Perhaps , their relative aloofness is intentional . Mr . Downey Jr . and Tom Sizemore are award-worthy , in their supporting roles ; the former's portrayal is the best example of the film's uncomfortable resonation . Stone's soundtrack choices ( Yo ! Patti Smith ) rock . The " Nature / Nurture " balance / influence on the film's anti-heroes is explained during the appropriately placed " Super Bowl " TV interview .

453559	15896852	2553	9.0	Making Movies Magical	Great early film short , directed superbly by D . W . Griffith . In it , Lillian and Dorothy Gish play sisters ( is that ever inspired casting ? ) terrorized by a wicked housekeeper and her male companion . They have the Gish sisters locked in a room , and terrorized them by firing a gun through a hole in the wall . It doesn't sound like much , but the direction makes in exciting ( there is a race to rescue them after they are able to make a phone call ) . Lillian and Dorothy Gish look extraordinary on film , together , in " An Unseen Enemy " ; though , the situation more than a little implausible . The Gish sisters are radiant . Also noteworthy are the scenes with Robert Harron which open and close the drama , earning him a Kiss from Dorothy Gish .

452825	15896852	119978	9.0	Matt Damon Passes the Bar for Francis Ford Coppola	" Francis Ford Coppola directs and scripts an exciting , star-packed adaptation of John Grisham's novel about an idealistic young attorney who takes on the case of a lifetime , " exactly as promotional synopsis promises , " Matt Damon plays Rudy Baylor , a rookie lawyer in over his head on a high-profile case . Opposing him : an army of seasoned legal sharks ( led by Jon Voight ) . On Rudy's side : Deck Shifflet ( Danny DeVito ) , a feisty ' paralawyer ' who specializes in flunking the bar exam . Rudy's chances are slim to none - until he uncovers a trail of corruption that might lead to the one thing that could win his case : the truth . " Mr . Damon's almost simultaneous participation in " Good Will Hunting " probably blew some of the wind out of this film's sails ; in hindsight , " The Rainmaker " shines brightly , and includes some award-worthy work . The most obvious nomination for " Supporting Actress " would be veteran Teresa Wright's lovely swansong as " Miss Birdie " ( it turned out to be the last of many great performances ) . Additionally , Mr . DeVito and Mr . Voight should have received some " Supporting Actor " consideration . The film features many strong characterizations , with Damon's lead providing perfect counterbalance . He , director Coppola , and novelist John Grisham are a formula worth repeating . Coppola manages to adapt Mr . Grisham's story successfully to film ; and , he keeps the staid courtroom sequences exciting . The characters played by Claire Danes ( Kelly Riker ) and Johnny Whitworth ( Donny Ray Black ) seem lacking - an additional scene or two , with Damon , would have been nice . The film's thesis rings true , and is expertly concluded . Grisham , Coppola , and Damon are a winning firm .

452475	15896852	29843	9.0	In Living Color	It's difficult to imagine anyone ( with a straight face ) filming a more definitive version of " Robin Hood " than this one . This is the story of the green clad crusader and his band of " Merry Men " ; to combat injustice , they rob from the rich and give to the poor . Errol Flynn ( as Robin Hood ) , Olivia de Havilland ( as Lady Marion Fitzwalter ) , Basil Rathbone ( as Sir Guy of Gisbourne ) , Claude Rains ( as Prince John ) , Patric Knowles ( as Will Starlett ) and Eugene Palette ( as Friar Tuck ) head up a great cast . Alan Hale ( as Little John ) most notably reprises his role , from the previous standard " Robin Hood " ( 1922 ) . Tony Gaudio and Sol Polito set stunning standards in color photography . And , Erich Wolfgang Korngold's soundtrack punctuates the picture perfectly .

At one café , sexy stowaway Laurie Bird ( as The Girl ) climbs into their 1955 Chevy ( and , later , into their jeans ) . After some roadhouse blues ( taking Jim Morrison's " Moonlight Drive " ) , the young men encounter exhibitionist Warren Oates ( as G . T . O ) , who thinks Mr .

Taylor and Wilson sing nothing at all ; but , if they had , the film's spell would be broken . Monte Hellman's " Two-Lane Blacktop " is not an easy rider . Often , it seems like nothing is happening . But , the characters and situations blend into something very pure , and dependable . Laid-back Harry Dean Stanton's gay cowboy and trucker George Mitchell ( the first handyman on " Dark Shadows " ) , fit perfectly into the mix . The landscape is extraordinary . The story is minimalist . Criticism is pointless . It can be about anything . And , the road goes on forever . . .

453345	15896852	29606	9.0	Sunrise , Sunset	Perky aspiring actress Janet Gaynor ( as Esther Blodgett ) leaves her small town for Hollywood ; instead of extra work , she finds work as a waitress . Ms . Gaynor breaks dishes ; imitates Greta Garbo , Katharine Hepburn , and Mae West ; and meets alcoholic actor Fredric March ( as Norman Maine ) . Mr . March likes Gaynor's sweetness and sincerity ; he arranges a screen test for her , and the two become romantically involved . Then , Gaynor becomes Hollywood's newest star sensation ( as " Vicki Lester " ) while March ( as " Mr . Lester " ) ' s star sets . David O . Selznick's version of " What Price Hollywood ? " ( among others ) is beautifully photographed ( W . Howard Greene ) and directed ( William A . Wellman ) ; especially noteworthy are the location scenes , with its near-final " sunset " providing an excellent thematic statement . Few of Gaynor's contemporaries could have played the early scenes with the same sincerity ( which parallels her character ) . She is terrific as the naïve young star ; most importantly , she is believable as a woman who steps from obscurity to stardom . March is perfect as the eclipsed movie idol ; it would have been nice to know more about his character's history of , and reason for , drinking ( amusement is a given reason ) . Lionel Stander ( as Matt Libby ) ' s portrayal of a prickly publicist stands out , among the supporting cast ( Adolphe Menjou , May Robson , and Andy Devine ) . This film was heralded as realistic depiction of " Hollywood " stardom ; and , there are cute , clever , and realistic details throughout . Nothing too extraordinary is revealed , however . The film barely scratches the surface ; and , it is curiously more asexual than previous cinematic trips down the walk of fame ( it was affected by the " Hays Code " , no doubt ) . Still , due to its strengths , this version of " A Star Is Born " compares most favorably with subsequent versions . A Star Is Born ( 1937 ) William A .

453041	15896852	246578	10.0	The Sky Is Falling ! The Sky Is Falling ! ( Don't Go in the Basement , Donnie ? )	This is " an edgy , psychological thriller about a suburban teen coming face-to-face with his dark destiny , " according to the promotional verbiage for the film , starring Jake Gyllenhaal as " a delusional high school student visited by a demonic rabbit with eerie visions of the past and deadly predictions for the future . " This description hardly scratches the surface of " Donnie Darko " . While watching the film , to enjoy a quirky , satisfying thriller , you may get the impression may be watching something more meaningful . You are . Repeated viewings ( recommended ) will reveal completely different films . Writer / director Richard Kelly creates more than a movie monster . " Donnie Darko " is an multi-layered , inspirational , and beautifully produced work . Most obviously , it is superbly written and directed . Mr . Kelly , who really pulls a rabbit out of his hat , should have received an " Academy Award " , along with several members of his crew ; perhaps , the film's more " independent " status was an obstacle . The cast is exceptional , from Mr . Gyllenhaal's central role , to the many supporting characterizations , right down to the smallest players . This film is full of memorable characters , arriving on the screen for a variety of reasons , and for various lengths of time , to serve a defined purpose . They're all jewels . The film is set in Middlesex , Suburbia , during 1988 . Forget April , for the Darko family , October is the cruelest month . Gyllenhaal is a kid held back in high school , for burning down a house . Presently , Gyllenhaal is a disturbed sleepwalker , who is not taking his medication ; perhaps , intuitively , he knows it wouldn't make any difference . Gyllenhaal lives with mother Mary McDonnell ( as Rose Darko ) , father Holmes Osborne ( as Eddie Darko ) , big sister Maggie Gyllenhaal ( as Elizabeth Darko ) , and little sister Daveigh Chase ( as Samantha Darko ) . They're all jewels . As with the entire cast , it's difficult to single out one Darko family performance . Gyllenhaal never disappoints . Secondarily , Ms . McDonnell's may be the best , due to Kelly's skillful writing . Motherly love , for a son who seems to be drifting into madness , is wondrous ; the delicacy of McDonnell's performance is perfectly suited to Gyllenhaal's fragility . Even Ms . Chase , who you'd expect to be the minor Darko , is magical ; she even writes about " The Last Unicorn " , Ariel ( before he died in the possession of Count Petofi ) . The characters who exist outside the Darko family are as important . Many of them are teachers . At school , Drew Barrymore ( as Karen Pomeroy ) covers English literature in spectacular fashion ; she challenges students ' critical thinking skills , and gives Gyllenhaal guidance . As one of the film's producers , Ms . Barrymore's the most valuable member of the faculty lounge . Beth Grant ( as Kitty Farmer ) displays a limitless ability to multitask . Noah Wyle ( as Kenneth Monnitoff ) lurks in the science department , and helps Gyllenhaal consider slipping into time . Moreover , he reveals the truth about Patience Cleveland ( as " Grandma Death " aka Roberta Sparrow ) , who whispers : " Every living creature on Earth dies alone . " Among the students , new girl in school Jena Malone ( as Gretchen Ross ) provides Gyllenhaal with love interest ; and , with a dark past of her own , she's a natural . Katharine Ross ( as Lilian Thurman ) is a dignified and memorable hypno-therapist . Patrick Swayze ( as Jim Cunningham ) plays the self-help guru with a convenient focus , " Controlling Fear " . Even small parts shine , like Jolene Purdy ( as Cherita Chen ) . And , imaginary friend James Duval ( as Frank ) belongs in a very special class ( note , he is not actually related to the addiction-signaling " Harvey " ) . Finally , the soundtrack , including original music by Michael Andrews , has to be one of the best assembled for a motion picture . From " The Killing Moon " ( by Echo and the Bunnymen ) to the new " Mad World " ( by Gary Jules ) , the mood is always finely tuned . Look up . Plane to catch . My time's out of space . Donnie Darko ( 2001 ) Richard Kelly - Jake Gyllenhaal , Jena Malone , Drew Barrymore , Mary McDonnell
452369	15896852	36241	10.0	Nursing the Outlaw	Jane Russell nurses Jack Buetel back to health - but , that's not all . Seriously , I rate this film extraordinarily high . I've watched the film three times . The first time , I resisted . I watched with amazement ? this movie has an incredible " look " . I suppose it's a film made in the ' 40s , seen mostly in the ' 50s , looking very much like an early ' 30s " talkie " - but , ACTED IN SLOW MOTION ! I wanted to dislike the film , but I really could not . I loved the saloon - reading the visible graffiti on the walls , never knowing who was going to shoot who , when , and why . . . When Mr . Buetel and Ms . Russell tumble in the hay , I recognized the scene from a dozen subsequent westerns ; yet , it seemed suspenseful the way director Hughes ( ? ) shot it here . I could not really state there is a rape ( others may ) ; and , I think , later scenes imply there was no rape . I believe the scene simply ended with her shirt torn . There certainly is a lot of ambiguity ! I agree there are some lines between the male actors which could be taken sexually . I caught those upon viewing the film during a second sitting . Early on , Mr . Huston wonders if Mr . Buetel might want to bunk with him if he doesn't " have a girl " . BUT , Huston has Russell already lined up . There is also the age old question of whether the western hero needs his horse , or his girl , more . Of course , the western hero picks his horse ! I believe these ambiguities add to the enjoyment of the film . They are additional things to think about during repeated viewing . During my second viewing , I just enjoyed the movie more ? it's just so unusually interesting . With all " classic " films , I think about different meanings , and things going on ? this movie has the ability to grow stronger thematically with repeated viewings . That's something I look for when rating a movie highly . A movie can take on a life of its own . I love the performances ? Mr . Mitchell and Huston are older , more experienced actors while Buetel and Russell are younger . They all work well together . I especially enjoy " Billy " and " Rio " as she nurses him to health . The most recent viewing ( today ) had me wondering about how the peculiar " look " of this film was achieved . It's very claustrophobic , but has some " location " stuff . I watched those scenes more carefully . I watched Mr . Buetel's guns during his " exchange " near the end . I noticed Ms . Russell's attire became more alluring with each scene . I noticed the tombstone closing : " HERE LIES ? " The tombstone is a " LIE " . Could this play on words have been intended ? This is a film I would call " chance art . " I have no idea what effect the filmmakers were looking for - - was it just intended as a showcase for Jane Russell's attributes ? That was achieved . All the rest is icing . I submit that " The Outlaw " creates a unique and entertaining " world " of its own . The four main performers are riveting . I think " The Outlaw " is a world worth repeated revisiting . Next , I need to keep my eyes on Billy the Kid's ears , and see when the blood drops appear on his shirt . The Outlaw ( 1943 ) Howard Hughes - Jack Buetel , Jane Russell , Walter Huston , Thomas Mitchell
453435	15896852	9968	10.0	The Twain Shall Meet	Richard Barthelmess ( as Cheng Huan ) is a gentle Chinese man ( " The Yellow Man " ) , immersed in the teachings of Buddha ; he is thinking of leaving China as a missionary . After witnessing a brawl among visiting westerners ( " Jackies " ) , Mr . Barthelmess is convinced that Anglo-Saxons need the gentle lessons of Buddha ; so , he immigrates to Limehouse , a poor London district . There , Lillian Gish ( as Lucy ) lives with her " Daddy " - - abusive boxer Donald Crisp ( as Battling Burrows ) . Ms . Gish is treated like a slave in the Burrows hovel ; she is regularly whipped by hard-drinking Mr . Crisp . Barthelmess finds London uninterested in Buddhism ; disillusioned , he opens a modest souvenir shop . Barthelmess and Gish meet , and fall in love ? Subtitled " The Yellow Man and the Girl " , D . W . Griffith's " Broken Blossoms " is poetically directed and photographed ( G . W . Bitzer ) . The opening scenes are lovely , simple scenes of Chinese people carrying on with their lives . Buddhist Barthelmess is the main " Yellow Man " ; and , though he is Caucasian , he fits in well . Griffith has some fighting " Anglo-Saxons " disrupt the peaceful scenes , this foreshadows later developments and illustrates the main theme and relationship - - the Eastern / Western culture clash represented by Barthelmess and Gish . Of course , the meeting of the two is doomed . Barthelmess ' performance as an Asian has a sensitivity not present in subsequent attempts by big name " Anglo " actors to play " Oriental " parts ; with a lot of integrity , he plays shopkeeper Cheng Huan as an idealist Buddhist becoming a disillusioned pipe-smoker ( probably of Opium ) . Watch for Barthelmess ' reaction when a Christian missionary announces he is leaving for China to convert their heathen ; it's a classic revelation of maturity and understanding . His expertly played love for Gish shows up in his eyes as love , not lust ; this is the more difficult , but correct , way to play the part . Gish is likewise magnificent , creating one of her most memorable characterizations ; her motion of using two fingers to force upon her face a " smile " is classic ; her eyes reveal the horror behind her tear-aged face . Gish is great , sadly walking the Limehouse streets , collecting tin foil , and admiring unaffordable flowers and dolls . At home , she finds it increasingly impossible to avoid Crisp's abuse . Crisp is sometimes too grimaced ; but , it works in later scenes . Note , in an early scene , when Gish encounters two prostitutes , that the prostitute to the left of your screen is making a " date " ! The good folks at KINO include Gish's introduction to " Broken Blossoms " ; she is a delightful storyteller ; among other things , she reveals boxer Norman Selby was " The Real McCoy " . An amazing , never to be equaled , film . Broken Blossoms ( / 19 ) D . W . Griffith - Richard Barthelmess , Lillian Gish , Donald Crisp , Edward Peil
