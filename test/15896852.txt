Unfortunately , the serum transforms Dr . Brewster into a simian-like creature and he desperately attempts to find a cure . Only human spinal fluid will return him to normal but , Dr . Brewster uses some nefarious methods to extract his needed supply , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . The author of the story supposedly makes an appearance at its closing - it's a good thing he rolls up the car window , to miss whatever you feel like throwing up at the screen . William Beaudine's " The Ape Man " is an embarrassment , even for a low-budget programmer . If the movie were a little better , you might be able to take some delight in Minerva Urecal's stone-faced sister , " Agatha Brewster " . But , the best actor has to be Emil Van Horn as " The Ape " , since he gets to save face . The Ape Man ( 1943 ) William Beaudine - Bela Lugosi , Louise Currie , Wallace Ford

Unbeknownst to the man , he has been attacked by a werewolf and now he's inherited the curse associated with such creatures . Now our hero must race against time to rid himself of this dreadful affliction before the next full moon , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Horrifically re-produced from the original Spanish , " The Fury of the Wolf Man " loses whatever charms it may have possessed in its original form . Lycanthropic Paul Naschy's werewolf characterization is uneven and ineffectual . Dominatrix scientist Perla Cristal and sexy assistant Verónica Luján never get close enough to truly titillate . The often incoherent storyline isn't even ghoulishly amusing .

" Like other films of its type , " Perversion for Profit " sought to both frighten and titillate its audiences ; today , it's either offensive or funny ( depending on your mood ) . The film provides a generous parade of pornographic images . Narrator George Putnam ( subtitled " outstanding news reporter " ) promises the photographs displayed will cover up offensive body parts , " for the sake of decency " - but , don't worry , he mostly means the little dark slits covering some of the models ' eyes . Mr . Putnam's approach is much like that employed , presently , by " folks " like Bill O'Reilly ; express shock while providing your audience with perversion , for profit .

What our travelers don't know is ' The Master ' and his demon-worshiping wives have awakened from their slumber to prey upon them for their sacrifices , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis .

While falling for the professor's daughter , our scientist begins to suspect that Professor King's secret research is somehow connected to the radiation and the deaths , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . There may be some effect of radiation on marine life , but this film presents the possibility in the dullest , most illogical way possible . The monster looks very silly . Possibly the most interesting character is inquisitive Vivi Janiss ( as Ethel ) , secretary to Professor King . And , more evidence that everyone in show business is related can be found in Helen Stanton ( as Wanda ) being the real life mother of " Doctor Drew " aka Drew Pinsky .

A final confrontation between the white gorilla and his former tribe's leader will decide the fate of all of Africa , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Ray " Crash " Corrigan ( as Steve Collins ) extensively recalls seeing the 1927 serial " Perils of the Jungle " , which had noting to do with " The White Gorilla " in his present form ( as Ray Corrigan ) . To wit , Mr . Corrigan witnesses his " friend " Frank Merrill ( as Ed Bradford ) in the old silent serial . Mr . Merrill , who also played " Tarzan " , must have got a kick out of seeing himself co-starring in a new movie , after almost 20 years of retirement from film . The opening credits promise an " All-Star Cast " , but neither Bing Crosby nor Greer Garson appear in this movie . The 1927 footage is better than the newer parts .

Pryor ( as Eddie ) had to have already been contracted and paid for this film to see completion . Otherwise , there are no credible responses to the remarks , " You guys are awful ! " and " This is NOT working ! " The most jaw-dropping unfunny moments involve yodeling . Mercedes Ruehl ( as Elaine aka Mimi ) has an sexy and effective black underwear scene . Pryor has a good sequence , upon arriving at the Fielding mansion . Wilder impersonates Cary Grant and Desi Arnaz . If you don't count Lucy , Ethel , and Elvia Allman working in the candy factory ( on the Fielding's TV ) , the early 1990s Hollywood location footage is the film's only real strength .

Ronald Reagan is a college professor who seeks to prove " nurture ' more important than " nature " by playing house with Diana Lynn ( surrogate mother ) and Chimpanzee - Bonzo . The homey environment will prove " bad " monkeys can be " good " monkeys ( just like people ) with a little family love and understanding ! The premise is ludicrous , of course - but , it's really only done to set-up a situation to make a movie starring Bonzo the Chimp . Bonzo is fine . How is he supposed to know the story is illogical ? Since it has a chimpanzee to share scenes with , the movie is disjointed - for example , witness this sequence : Bonzo escapes into a tree , is joined by Reagan in an obviously different tree , drops eyeglasses to nowhere , jumps into the house in time for the next scene , then shocks everyone by escaping from the house ! It all manages to looks even worse than it is ; assisted , obviously , by a low budget . Bedtime for Bonzo ( 1951 ) Frederick De Cordova - Ronald Reagan , Diana Lynn , Walter Slezak

Marion Leonard is " The Gibson Girl " , an extraordinarily beautiful woman ; so much so , she draws a crowd of admiring followers wherever she goes . The fact that Ms . Leonard's feminine frame is always complimented by figure hugging frocks doesn't help the men stay away . Tired of the manly attention , Leonard endeavors to pretend she has fat legs ; finally , will the men leave her alone ? Marion Leonard is , indeed , a very beautiful woman . That's about it for this film . Some ambiguity among her masculine admirers adds some comic relief to D . W . Griffith's " The Gibson Goddess " .

Notice how , even suspended , Mr . Rogers is able to get the Rough Riders to join in his Round-up ! This is not one of the better Roy Rogers westerns . The fighting scenes look like choreographed dances . Rogers sings / yodels " Ridin ' Down the Trail " , one of two relatively ordinary songs ; and , a stand-out moment , overall .

Carlson wants to marry wealthy Lugene Sanders ( as Meg Hubbard ) , defying the statuesque ex-girlfriend . This is a sometimes intriguing , and occasionally okay , ghost story . Sweet little sister Susan Gordon ( as Sandy Hubbard ) , creepy beatnik Joe Turkel ( as Nick ) , and stocky blind seer Lillian Adams ( as Mrs . Ellis ) are an oddly appealing supporting cast . Ms . Gordon is , coincidently , director Bert I . Gordon's daughter ; and , she ain't half bad . The story is the main problem , as you'll see . There are several obvious ways it could be improved upon .

452816	15896852	19800	3.0	Losing It	For her second talking film appearance , Paramount presented Clara Bow ( as Pat Delaney ) in the audience pleasing " circus " genre , with a " Wings " co-star , Richard Arlen ( as Larry Lee ) . Although the formula seemed like a blockbuster in the making , the film was disappointing . Bow is cast in an inappropriate , and dull , " change of pace " role . She is unconvincing as the demure girl who becomes a " high wire " circus star . At one point , we are expected to believe Bow's pleasingly plump figure passes for Mr . Arlen , in a clown costume , on the high wire ! Arlen is also unconvincing , playing the tending to be tipsy alcoholic " King of the High Wire " . Kay Francis ( as Zara Flynn ) rounds out the expected " love triangle " . Bow's " stand around and wait " attempt to pry Arlen's interests from Ms . Francis ' arms is uncharacteristic . On the plus side , the cast and crew put some obvious effort into a sound production . The " Dangerous Curves " referred to in the title are plainly stated as Arlen's trials and tribulations with job , alcohol , and women . So , the film's content may have been altered to focus on Arlen , then a lesser box office star than Bow . Still , it was a Bow film , and audiences undoubtedly bought tickets to see Clara Bow's " Dangerous Curves " . And , as a Bow starring vehicle , " Dangerous Curves " was a modest success . For the year 1928-29 , Clara Bow was the US # 1 " Box Office Star " , according to the industry standard list compiled by Quigley Publications . After " Dangerous Curves " , box office receipts declined sharply . Suddenly , Clara Bow's reign was over . Dangerous Curves ( / 29 ) Lothar Mendes - Clara Bow , Richard Arlen , Kay Francis

Big mistake . Mr . Gleason draws the attention of a passing policeman , and Emerson is left holding the bag .

Having idolized his brother to the point of it being an obsession , the young man cannot believe he was guilty , even though he was , and swears to avenge him . The crazed young man decides to carry out his revenge by tracking down and killing all the officials and jurors responsible for his brother's trial and execution , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Boris Petroff's " Anatomy of a Psycho " is a pale period piece , which seemingly sought to ( given the title ) bask in the glow of two significantly more timeless films . It might have been interesting had it tweaked the covertly homosexual relationship between Darrell Howe ( as Chet Marco ) and Frank Kiliman ( as Bobby Brown ) , for starters . By the way , it's easy to mistake Mr . Howe for Ronnie Burns ( as Mickey Craig ) , due to the latter's star billing . Mr . Burns , who plays a slightly more secondary role to Mr . Howe's " bad boy " lead , was the more well-known actor , due to his appearing from 1955-'59 on his parents ' TV series . Relax , Ronnie does not stray too far from his familiar role as the nice young son of George Burns & Gracie Allen .

As they plot a hilarious heist that could make - or break - their futures , the students grow closer , never suspecting where they'll ultimately find the real answers ? within themselves . " The leading players are good-looking , but they neither look nor act like they are in high school . Nothing against the actors hired , but there are adult performers who could pass for high school age students . A couple of changes would have given the cast a more believable appearance . What makes it worse is that the idea was a good one , but , really ? this cast doesn't look like they are teens stressing-out over getting " The Perfect Score " on their SATs . Instead , they look like they should be having sex and getting sliced up by " Freddy " or " Jason " . The lighting and photography ( Clark Mathis ) are nice .

His assistant uses the formula to keep the scientist's severed head alive in an attempt to transplant the head of ( a ) beautiful , but hunch-backed , nurse to the body of an exotic dancer , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Victor Trivas ' " The Head " is a lurid decapitation import . The dog operation is referred to , but not shown . The film is better done , but not as much fun as " The Brain That Wouldn't Die " .

After making an impression in 1940's popular " The Westerner " , young Forrest Tucker ( as Jerry Barton ) is piloted into a starring programmer role . " Emergency Landing " ( inappropriately re-titled " Robot Pilot " ) is an unimpressive vehicle for Mr . Tucker , who would find later success in television's " F Troop " . Listen for an amusing exchange between leading lady Carol Hughes ( as Betty Lambert ) and aunt Evelyn Brent ( as Maude Marshall ) : on their way to tinsel town , Ms . Brent wonders what she will do in Hollywood . Ms . Hughes replies , " Barrymore is single again . " Brent appeared with John Barrymore in " Raffles " ( 1917 ) and " Night Club Scandal " ( 1937 ) ; indeed , he had just received his fourth divorce .

Although neither seems at all attracted to the other , he tries to pick her up . After repeated attempts and refusals , the ill-matched duo decide they can make beautiful music together . They make out in a cab , and eventually tie the knot . Then , wouldn't you know , their careers follow the predictable " A Star Is Born " path . How could a well-budgeted Martin Scorsese direct Ms . Minnelli , and Mr . De Niro in a film so dull ? " New York , New York " is an astonishing misuse of resources . A lot of the dialogue seems improvised , as has been noted by some of the principals . Mr . Scorsese certainly gives the undeserving story a stylish look , however . And , the music is terrific ; especially Minnelli's standout performance of " New York , New York " - - if you can stand the wait .

As planned , Lawrence falls for her noble savior ; but , later , she learns of the deception , and sends him away . Yet , she loves him ? The D . W . Griffith stock is more difficult to spot in costumed frocks . Lawrence is pretty as the Princess ; she and Powell have fun playing for the " The Cardinal's Conspiracy " . Griffith always makes the most out of a man's facial hair .

Proud of her successful baking endeavor , Lawrence packs up her remaining biscuits , to bring to Cumpson's workplace , a " Theatrical Booking Office " . " Biograph Girl " Lawrence shines . There is mild fun in watching a slew of 1909 D . W . Griffith players acting " theatrical " after partaking of Lawrence's distasteful biscuits ! Not surprisingly , Mack Sennett is a stand-out among the bunch - - however , for the most part , the promising comedy bits / situations are far too underdeveloped to make this film a comic classic .

Arlen writes John and Martha Smithers a check , to buy their oil-rich land , then schemes to cover its cost . But , old enemy Buster Crabbe ( as Mike Rawlins ) isn't about to let Arlen strike it rich without a fight . Additional arrivals provide further intrigue ( William Frawley ) and love interest ( Arline Judge ) . While " Wildcat " Arlen and many of the supporting cast are pleasant , this is an mostly dull story . An exciting scene occurs early on , which prematurely kills off the film's most endearing , up to that point , character . The tragedy is necessary for subsequent plot developments , which are anticlimactic .

The soundtrack songs are a highlight , appropriately sounding like Brian Wilson's Beach Boys ; moreover , Frankie and Annette are joined by Dick Dale and Stevie Wonder . Morey Amsterdam should have been retained as a series regular . The Eric Von Zipper motorcycle gang is missing .

Doubting their story , the attorney begins to reconsider when a rash of mysterious deaths occur at the castle , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Translated from Italy as " Terror-Creatures from the Grave " , this disappointing slice of horror is most notable for the inclusion of the always delectable Barbara Steele ( as Cleo Hauff ) in its cast .

Like in days of old , handsome male model Ethan Erickson ( as Louis ) wishes for eternal youth . Then , while one of his pictures ages , he becomes the ageless " Dorian " of the title . Like his predecessors , Mr . Erickson descends into decadent debauchery . A charismatic older mentor , Malcolm McDowell ( as Henry ) , eggs him on . . . Re-titled " Pact with the Devil " . Allan A . Goldstein's updated " Dorian " alters the story in ways that become nonsensical . The main problem occurs by making Mr . McDowell's character semi-Faustian . To have McDowell in the cast , and render his character inexplicable , should be a crime . Erickson , an extremely good-looking man , is also slighted by a faltering characterization - in an early scene , he is required to pretend he couldn't imagine someone thinking he could be a pin-up boy ? And , Jennifer Nitsch ( as Bae ) has an undeveloped , but intriguing , back-story . Dorian ( 2001 ) Allan A . Goldstein - Ethan Erickson , Malcolm McDowell , Jennifer Nitsch

As is the case in most Civil War stories , the opposing soldiers once had a close relationship ; in this case , they were West Point buddies . Mr . Craig is also in love with a beautiful woman , Barbara Payton ( as Kathy Summers ) . This is a fairly predictable Civil War story . The dramatics are enhanced by Ms . Payton in the feminine lead . Payton is the most interesting player in the middling " Drums in the Deep South " ; with a better part , and direction , Payton might have been a much bigger star . Her biography is sad , and typical .

Thinking the woman is her long-lost mother , DuVall uses a mutual lover , Eric Roberts ( as Jacob ) , to learn about Hannah , and herself . Paul Ryan's photography is the film's main strength . DuVall is endearing . It's nice to see Roberts in a more " artistic " film . However , Melissa Painter's " Wildflowers " are just of reach .

They have been told surgical separation would risk Mr . Kinnear's life , because Mr . Damon possesses most of the pair's operating liver . The twins , who prefer to be called " conjoined " , work in a Martha's Vineyard hamburger joint ( " Quickee Burger " ) . Despite their disability , they lead relatively fulfilled lives . However , Damon has not been able to have a romantic relationship ; although , he has been corresponding with a Los Angeles woman on the Internet . Kinnear also has interests in the Hollywood area - he wants to move there , and pursue an acting career . In Hollywood , Kinnear gets a job on a TV show with Cher ( as Cher ) . Cher doesn't really want to do television , and uses her cast approval clause to hire Kinnear / Damon as co-star of " Honey and the Beaze " . She hopes the network will have difficulty with conjoined twins , and terminate her contract . Meanwhile , Damon has hit it off with Asian Internet sweetheart Wenn Yann Shih ( as May Fong ) ; but , he is hiding his physical limitations from her ? Neither gross nor funny , " Stuck on You " simply plays itself out . The film reaches its height during the satirical subplot featuring Cher , and her unwanted TV series . Eva Mendes ( as April Mercedes ) is another supporting attraction . Meryl Streep has two cameos ; the first one , in the tinted glasses , is better .

452698	15896852	58700	4.0	I Am Legend ( Not )	As many others note , the plot and several scenes are eerily similar to the superior " Night of the Living Dead " . The fact that this film came first , and probably inspired the latter film , does not mean this film should be elevated ; it is not good . It isn't even original , being another adaptation of " I Am Legend " . I found myself wondering how Mr . Price's character is able to hold up in that house for a number of years - - Who keeps the electricity running ? How are food and water supplied ? Why don't these obviously very intelligent ( despite their appearance ) ghouls figure out a way to get into Price's house ? Well , those are only the beginning questions ? Price could have been helped by a bigger film budget . I thought the dog turned in the finest acting performance . The worst performance was that of the crying baby ; I guess the baby's Italian cry had to be dubbed into an English cry ?

453117	15896852	20143	4.0	Marion Meets the Moustache	Marion Davies moves unsteadily into sound films , as the title character in the musical " Marianne " . This was Davies ' first sound film ; a silent version was filmed earlier . In her first aural offering , Ms . Davies combines silent mannerisms with a sometimes lilting , sometimes grunting French accent . Davies is admired by several U . S . soldiers , but mostly Lawrence Gray ( as Stagg ) . Mr . Gray helps retrieve Davies ' stolen pig , albeit mostly eaten . There are several embarrassing scenes , but the film really goes downhill during a musical number involving Benny Rubin ( Sam ) and Cliff Edwards ( Soapy ) serenading a distraught Davies . This song and dance is followed by Davies doing deep knee bends , in drag , while bragging about her intimacy with a General . Later on , she does musical impressions of Maurice Chevalier and Sarah Bernhardt . They are not as fun as they sound ! Mr . Rubin sings " The Girl from Neufchâteau " extremely well , though ; his is the film's best musical performance . The best scene occurs with Davies in a military jeep , with Gray ; she is still disguised as a male officer , complete with moustache and a cap . The scene works because Davies , instead of playing a French woman , play-acts a French officer . Here , she proves herself an actress well-suited for talking pictures . You may also notice her sometimes uncanny resemblance to Lucille Ball ; especially , recall Ms . Ball's " Lucy Meets the Moustache " ( 1960 ) . It is most obvious Ball referenced some of Davies ' comic work .

Sent away to a mental institution for evaluation , the man returns later to take up residence at his sister's home . Psychosomatically blinded by the incident , the man struggles with his life daily but finds things harder for him , when strange incidents begin to happen to him that has people doubting his sanity . Is it someone with a vendetta against him or is it something far more sinister ? " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Psycho-acting Anthony Perkins ( as Allen ) is good , gradually building up sympathy for his character's questionable point of view . Scarred sister Julie Harris ( as Katherine ) and girlfriend Joan Hackett ( as Olive ) provide fine support . Yet , this TV movie squanders everything in its final seconds , as the title " How Awful About Allen " is reprised . It's difficult to comprehend what is being suggested ; perhaps , it was meant to stifle the previous predictability . Good cast , though .

Renegade bloodsuckers don't help matters by creating vampire mischief among the tasty humans . In order to help a government plan to integrate vampires into mainstream society succeed , vampire cop Adrian Paul ( as Aaron Gray ) teams up with human cop Bokeem Woodbine ( as Steve Grant ) . Mr . Paul , who survived Nazis by becoming undead , is a vampire rights proponent . Paul is troubled by flashbacks , and has to avoid bloodlust . Mr . Woodbine has to overcome his prejudices against vampires , when he finds himself falling in love with sexy Chinese vampire Bai Ling ( as Lucy Westenra ) . Michael Oblowitz ' " The Breed " has a good supporting cast , and a stylish look ; but , the plot doesn't really dig . Most obviously , the mishmash of symbolism is confusing ; and , the movie becomes absurd . The " love story " between Woodbine and Ms . Ling has no teeth ; in fact , the shooting of a gay vampire's testicle is played as sexier . Nosferatu and Dracula are obviously referenced . And , so is horror queen Barbara Steele , who co-starred with Adrian Paul in " Dark Shadows " , as " Her name is Barbara Steele ? " introduces the film's most bloody victim .

Rogers , if elected Sheriff , will follow in the footsteps of his Roy Rogers namesakes ( including his father and grandfather ) . However , Rogers seems meek and mild ; though a popular man , townspeople wonder if he is up to the job . This is an interesting Rogers vehicle in that the character is presented as a hero perhaps not up to the task at hand ; no points for guessing how he does , finally ! There is the expected " shootout " to end the film , but it really peaks earlier as Rogers ' car is stolen ; he gets the car back in fine form . Rogers sings with Gabby , with Bob Nolan and the " Sons of the Pioneers " , and with some unfortunately intrusive dialog .

453724	15896852	71803	4.0	Lucy Hits the Wall	" You're invited to party hearty - and in fabulous style - with this lavish 1974 screen version of the beloved Broadway musical . Lucille Ball brings star sparkle to the title role , a high-living grande dame who's outlandishly eccentric and , when suddenly faced with raising an orphaned nephew , fiercely loving . Veterans of the New York stage original join her : Beatrice Arthur as best friend ' Vera ' , Jane Connell as prim governess ' Agnes ' , choreographer Onna White , and director Gene Saks . As Mame's husband ' Beauregard ' , Robert Preston sings ' Loving You ' , written specially for the film . Jerry Herman's songs , from ' It's Today ' to ' We Need a Little Christmas ' to ' If He Walked Into My Life ' , rank among the best show tunes ever . For a grand time , bring home ' Mame ' , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Let's try to be kind , since Lucy's " Mame " is all too obvious in its faults . After about an hour - if you can stay tuned ( if not , fast forward to the coach arrival of Ms . Ball and Mr . Preston at his southern plantation ) , the film gets better . Ball hilariously meets Preston's family while impersonating " Scarlet O'Hara " , goes fox-trotting on the horse " Lightning Rod " , and participates in the film's best musical production number . The choreography and performance of the title song " Mame " is breezy and breathtaking ; and , it serves as a sweet tribute to Ball , in her last feature film . These mid-movie sequences give the film a lift , and the next hour of the film is more enjoyable than the first . Still , there's no getting around the fact that the miscasting of Ball in the title role was a fatal flaw . Now , with Mae West as " Vera " and Desi Arnaz as " Beauregard " , it might have worked ?

After Mr . Bradford helps the voluptuous Ms . Christensen get into the locker , she succeeds in getting into his swimming trunks . Bradford wants their wet encounter to remain a " one night stand " , but Christensen wants more . She goes psycho . Soon , high school life for Bradford and sweet , steady girlfriend Shiri Appleby ( as Amy Miller ) is filled with misery ? and murder . " Swimfan " is smoothly directed by John Polson , nicely photographed by Giles Nuttgens , and contains some engaging performances - but , the film is really very ordinary . The story misses opportunities to plot new ground . And , the " younger " performers are clearly too old to be in high school ( they might have tried a " community college " setting ) . The supporting cast includes Richard Burton's daughter Kate ( a very sweet lady ) , and John Ritter's son Randy ( nepotism doesn't run in the Ritter family , it gallops ) .

453703	15896852	109836	4.0	Kenneth Branagh's " Frankenstein "	This curious , good-looking version of Mary Shelley's " Frankenstein " was promoted as faithful to the original work - and , although is follows events much more closely than the familiar version , its changes make it a more different , distant work than you might expect . The overriding theme is not man creating artificial life , and the consequences of this action . Instead , this film is about Kenneth Branagh ( as Victor Frankenstein ) desiring Helena Bonham Carter ( as Elizabeth ) . As he is unable to consummate their relationship , the sexually frustrated Mr . Branagh goes crazy and creates a artificial , monster man . Both are drenched in goopy embryonic fluid , with Branagh displaying his chest most prominently . The created Robert De Niro ( as Frankenstein's Creature ) wants to mate , just like his creator . But , when Branagh is about to have sex ( finally ) with Ms . Carter , Mr . De Niro interrupts . After a near encounter with De Niro , Carter expires . Then , she is brought back to life , with the same face gashes De Niro displays . By the way , why do the creatures have these face gashes ? Anyway , now you have two sexually frustrated men vying for the same , once pretty " Bride of Frankenstein " - and , they don't care how she looks anymore ! Will Branagh ( or even De Niro ) ever get to consummate with Carter ? Two dizzying hours later , will you care ? Frankenstein ( 1994 ) Kenneth Branagh , Robert De Niro , Helena Bonham Carter
453229	15896852	38033	4.0	Way Out West with the Stooges	The Three Stooges in a feature length western comedy-musical ? Perhaps " Rockin ' in the Rockies " was meant to combine the Stooges comedy short with the western musical , in a matinée ; if so , this was a pleasant way to break up a Saturday afternoon . Jay Kirby ( as Rusty ) is a handsome young hero ; and , Marty Beth Hughes ( as the blonde June ) and Gladys Blake ( as the brunette Betty ) are pretty women . The Hoosier Hotshots are a harmonious group ; their songs are quite tuneful ; however , this is the 1940s , not the 1950s , so the film doesn't exactly " rock " . There are a few laughs ; but the Stooges ' brand of humor is more subdued than usual . The talking horse is also underutilized .

453521	15896852	32342	5.0	Giving it Up for James Cagney	James Cagney ( as Danny ) is a New York City truck driver who takes up boxing in order to finance his brother Arthur Kennedy ( as Eddie ) ' s musical career . Ann Sheridan ( as Peggy ) is Danny's childhood girlfriend - she gives up their romance for a dancing career , and ends up weeping profusely for it . The film begins as the " City for Conquest " characters are children , living in New York city's lower East Side . Each child mirrors his / her adult development ; for example , " Danny " fights , " Peggy " dances , and " Eddie " squeezes his music box . These opening scenes are well-done , and effectively introduce the characters . However , the switch from children to adult actors fails because the " Danny " boy is so unlike actor James Cagney - it's very startling when Cagney appears . The other children are very well-cast ; the boy playing Elia Kazan's " Googi " character looks especially like the adult " Googi " . The boy playing Mr . Cagney looks so different , you have to wonder if another actor might have been planned to star in this film . Additionally , the children are depicted as being about the same age , but the adult Cagney appears much older when they are adults ; he goes from being about Ms . Sheridan's age to looking like her father ! He looks too out-of-shape for the role , also , of the " Young Samson " . Frank Craven appears as " Old Timer " ; he seems to have great knowledge , but his role is confusing . Anthony Quinn is Ms . Sheridan's greasy dancing partner ( and abductor ? ) Murray Burns . For some reason , Mr . Quinn spent WAY TOO LONG in the make-up chair - his eye make-up is the film's heaviest ! Yet , the cast is worth watching . James Cagney is , after all , still Cagney . Mr . Kennedy and Mr . Kazan perform their parts very well . The structurally flawed story does move - and , Sheridan's profuse weeping could squeeze one out of you .

Suddenly , Mr . Marshall's doctor character reveals he has been in love with Garbo since they were 12-year-old schoolchildren . At last , Garbo has a suitor ! At last , Dr . Marshall finds a woman ! Then , the entire supporting cast is wiped away as the quickly wedded couple moves to China . In China , Garbo wears funny hats and attracts the attention of Mr . Brent . Now , the film is a " love triangle " . Next , cholera erupts , giving the doctor's life much purpose ( a " War on Cholera " ) . About an hour into the film , Garbo begins to give flashes of a fascinating acting performance - peaking in the scene where she makes coffee for estranged husband Marshall . Her skills are wasted , however , in this poorly executed film . The Painted Veil ( / 34 ) Richard Boleslawski - Greta Garbo , Herbert Marshall , George Brent

There , she moves in with her generous , more well-to-do sister Polly Moran ( as Polly Rochay ) . Ms . Dressler joins Ms . Moran at work in her " Beauty Parlor " and " Reducing " salon , with calamitous results . Dressler is frequently funny , and Moran mostly so ; but , the comedy suffers whenever the focus becomes their respective daughters ' love story . Dressler and Moran squabble over the younger women's interest in the same man , which becomes an issue about class . Still , Dressler is terrific , especially in the first half .

Parmalee ( Philip Carey ) sends Reese ( Neville Brand ) and Joe ( William Smith ) out to assist the slightly embarrassed Chad , and salvage the mission . Pretty-in-pink Ms .

Skin watchers should note that studly Chad and hunky Smith perform their opening scenes shirtless . And , later on , " Playboy Playmate " Staley gets to show her bare shoulders and legs while dressing ( behind a conveniently large tree , however ) . This episode features a very enjoyable guest performance , by Staley . She and Mr . Brown perform their " re-encounter " scene exceptionally well . " Anybody Here Seen Billy ? " is very nicely directed , by non-appearing actor Lawrence Dobkin ; and , Andrew Jackson's color photography is just right . Finally , Mr .

Moreover , Mary won't shop until she's sure she'll get a gift in return , and Jeff is keeping a " profit-and-loss ledger " for the year . Donna wonders what happened to the Christmas spirit of giving . She finds answers when she gets to know the generous janitor at the Hilldale Hospital - indeed , very special guest star Buster Keaton ( as Charlie ) . This episode must have endeared Donna and her television family to millions of viewers . It isn't terribly well done , but it isn't terrible . The appearance of Mr . Keaton is a treat . And , the hospital children are very sweet . In their hospital beds , they read a very rare edition of " Captain Marvel Adventures " - the cover is visible , but it doesn't match any cover I could find , web-surfing . Since the comic book ended publication in 1953 , it's strange to see a decent copy last through ( at least ) five years in a children's hospital ( or , TV prop room ) .

He has an overweight friend ( Ethan Suplee as " Tuna " ) . In 1968 , he has grown into Johnny Depp . Mr . Depp and pal " Tuna " move to California . They meet women on the beach , and get stoned . Depp also meets Paul Reubens ( as Derek Foreal ) , who turns him on to selling pot . Depp becomes a HUGE drug dealer . This movie had me going until the switch to California . I was distracted by Depp's different hairstyles . By the 1970s , Depp looked older than his mother . The way people age , and change hairstyles is screwy ; so , is the soundtrack song selection order . Depp's characterization is interesting , at least ; he has my respect for taking chances with his movie roles . Penelope Cruz ( as Mirtha ) lifts things considerably when she appears , but it's a long , long wait . For a film so effective in its " based on a true story " opening , I was surprised so few of the cast seemed to act like they took drugs . Depp performed well , however ; with his scenes hitting bottom , and recovering , being impressive ( see the beating and childbirth scenes ) . Emma Roberts performs very well as the daughter Kristina ; her scenes with Depp make you care about the character . Director Ted Demme was promising , but died shortly after this film . . .

" Little Annie Rooney " is a well-produced film ; however , Pickford's " little girl " characterization does not fit the slummy story . The film begins with Pickford in a protruded fight with fellow street children , throwing bottles , bricks , and fists at each other . Apparently , this is meant to show Pickford as a " tomboy " character ; but , frankly , she appears insultingly retarded . Pickford's pouting performance is more cloying than convincing , through most of the film . A well-intentionally diverse cast provides some cringe worthy moments ; for example , Pickford spoon-feeding Spec O'Donnell's " Abie Levy " character some ham . Gordon Griffith ( as Tim Rooney ) is another notable co-star ; his mother Katherine was the fine supporting actress seen in Pickford's " Pollyanna " . Director William Beaudine re-teamed with his star for the superior " Sparrows " ( 1926 ) .

So , he has second thoughts . Mr . Harnett decides to track down Ms . Kruger . So , he runs into ravenous Rose Byrne ( as Alex ) . Matthew Lillard ( as Luke ) is a pleasant on-screen pal .

In order to clinch the job , Murray pretends to be infamous dancer Gloria De Moin . Murray is also the only dancer available to hire , as all of the other applicants walk out . Randy Rudolph Valentino ( as Jimmy Calhoun ) is a " Peach Tree Inn " patron who becomes enamored with Murray - he wants to marry her , but his wealthy father is wary . Meanwhile , Bertram Grassby ( as Duke de Sauterne ) returns to complicate matters ; he was involved with the real Gloria De Moin , and is on the lam from the law ? Handsome Valentino and smarmy Grassby are the highlight of the film , which picks up considerably whenever the two strut their stuff over Murray . Otherwise , the story is uninteresting , and the comedy doesn't work . Unfortunately , the film is " speeded up " - possibly , this is done to enhance its comedy effect ; instead , it can make you dizzy , or put you to sleep . " The Delicious Little Devil " is not the place start , if you want to appreciate silent films fully . The Delicious Little Devil ( 1919 ) Robert Z .

A " star vehicle " for Chatterton ; " Frisco Jenny " is , otherwise , unsatisfying . Chatterton and the cast are entertaining , though ; and , she performs especially well during the film's final scenes . During the trial , William A . Wellman's direction is somewhat dizzying .

In fact , she enjoys treating men they way they have always treated women ; and , attractive new hires are invited to Ms . Chatterton's mansion for an evening of vodka and sex . When invitees get out of line , or expect more than a " one night stand " , Chatterton has them transferred . The boss woman goes unsatisfied when evening " pick up " George Brent ( as Jim Thorne ) turns her down . When she discovers Mr . Brent is a new hire at her company , Chatterton again tries , and fails , to seduce him . Has Chatterton finally met her match ? " Female " looks most like a William A . Wellman film , but boasts three directors ; and , here's how ( more or less ) : The film's director was William Dieterle ; then , he became ill . So , the film was directed ( mostly ) by Mr . Wellman . However , Jack Warner was unhappy with George Blackwood's performance ( as Cooper ) . The studio ordered the scenes with Mr . Blackwood re-shot . Then , Michael Curtiz directed ( only ) the scenes with Blackwood's replacement , Johnny Mack Brown ( as Cooper ) . Still , the completed film was to credit Wellman ( rightly ) . But , Wellman and Warner Brothers terminated their relationship ( unhappily ) . So , the studio credited Mr . Curtiz . With whomever directing , Chatterton is terrific ; sadly , her efforts are ruined by an ending which is almost repulsive - - what this film does to Chatterton's character is criminal . Still , " Female " is well worth watching , mainly for Chatterton's great style , and performance . Brent ( her off-screen husband , at the time ) is at his very best , too . And , the supporting cast is great fun . For example , Ferdinand Gottschalk ( as Pettigrew ) amuses in the workplace ; and , don't miss Rafaela Ottiano ( as Della ) getting a swat in the derrière ! Note Ms . Ottiano was Greta Garbo's maid in " Grand Hotel " ( 1932 ) ; incidentally , Garbo used the name " Harriet Brown " ( Lois Wilson's character ) , and the soon divorced leading man George Brent , from this film .

There are some stereotypes evident , but this is a surprisingly well-done comedy from the time period . Possibly , the most " offensive " bit is not the gender role playing , but the repeated bit involving Mr . Menjou and the water fountain . Donald Meek ( as Henry ) and Marjorie Main ( as Nora ) are delightful as servants to the gender-bending couple . Mr . Hubbard and Ms . Landis are funny and believable .

They are : computer expert Robert Redford ( as Bishop ) , former CIA employee Sidney Poitier ( as Crease ) , gadgets wizard Dan Ackroyd ( as Mother ) , young genius River Phoenix ( as Carl ) , and blind soundman David Strathairn ( as Whistler ) . The men are joined in progress by Mary McDonnell ( as Liz ) , likely a former " Sneaker " and definitely a former girlfriend of leader Redford . Mr . Redford , who dominates the action , is also connected to the film's main villain , Ben Kingsley ( as Cosmo ) . Mr . Kingsley's identity isn't too surprising , once you realize he didn't grow up to be the character played by Mr . Ackroyd . The mission is to retrieve a " black box " for some nasty men , who claim to be representing the United States government . The best chunk of the film involves the extended " computer date " Ms . McDonnell has with Stephen Tobolowsky ( as Werner Brandes ) as Redford breaks into the man's office . It begins about the time Mr . Ackroyd arrives with the man's trash and ends with Mr . Phoenix crashing into a scene between Redford and nasty Eddie Jones . Director Phil Alden Robinson , and WarGames-men Lawrence Lasker and Walter F . Parkes , create a good deal of suspense , highlighted by a light sense of humor . But , the picture's conflict ( Redford / Kingsley ) isn't very interesting or dramatic . Although the terrific " Sneakers " team falls short of expectations , their participation alone makes it a film worth watching .

Hampton Fancher's " The Minus Man " is baffling . What's up with the imaginary room entrance , the borrowed truck , and the head bashing ? What compels Wilson ? Was it the spider that crawled in his ear ? Are the detectives imaginary , or from the future ? Like Vann says , " There's a mystery here that I could one day be tempted to explore , when I learn it better . " The film is interesting and well-performed , but only minimally satisfying as a story . The Minus Man ( 1999 ) Hampton Fancher - Owen Wilson , Janeane Garofalo , Brian Cox
453473	15896852	12940	6.0	J . B . Warner Jumps the Fence	Devil-may-care buckaroo J . B . Warner ( as Jim Gregory ) is torn between two pretty women : south-of-the-border Senorita Elinor Fair ( as Mercedes Aloyez ) catches his romantic eye - but , beautiful Caucasian waitress-in-distress Wilamae Carson ( as Mary Moore ) also captures his attention . Probably , the weakest part of the story involves how the women become a dilemma for Mr . Warner , because he is scripted to favor Ms . Fair almost exclusively ; Ms . Moore unexpectedly attains an equal romantic status , later in the running . And , Warner's selection seems strangely xenophobic . Despite its shortcomings , " Big Stakes " is an enjoyable , well-paced silent western . The handcuffed " big stake " opening leads a few clever bits , and the cast performs them very well . The climax provides some old-fashioned D . W . Griffith-styled excitement . Tall-in-the-saddle Warner is comically supported by rotund ton-of-fun Hilliard Karr ( as " Skinny " Fargo ) . This film provides a rare look at Warner , a western star who died unexpectedly . Les Bates and Robert Grey , the actors playing the two main villains , also died too soon .

452860	15896852	34936	6.0	Citizen Forrest	Keeper of the Flame ( 1942 ) George Cukor - Spencer Tracy , Katharine Hepburn , Margaret Wycherly The film opens with the never appearing " Robert Forrest " dying in a car crash . Robert Forrest was , as it turn out , a great American hero ; his tragic accident is big news ; and , and the country mourns . Biographical journalist Spencer Tracy ( as Steve O'Malley ) decides to write a story about Forrest's life ; but , the prospective " Keeper of the Flame " finds it difficult to interview beautiful Forrest widow Katharine Hepburn ( as Christine ) . And , the people closest to the deceased accident victim are mysteriously uncooperative . What are they hiding ? Tracy and Hepburn , under George Cukor's moody direction , are great fun to watch . Mr . Cukor and photographer William Daniels are especially Garbo-like when introducing Hepburn's character . Still , it's Tracy who holds everything together . The revelation about " Robert Forrest " was unexpected ( to me , anyway ) ; it was nice to see a film show the American belief system is based on ideas and truths rather than mindless patriotism . The film should have been better . First , the movie's main " romantic " relationship seems to occur too suddenly ; certainly , the film's stars were capable of portraying a man and woman falling in love . Also , what did the Forrests ' do ? It's hinted , once , that " Christine " may have been an actress ( believable ) ; but , what office did her husband hold ( if any ) ? Of the supporting cast , Margaret Wycherly seems truest , as the dead hero's " invalid " mother ; a couple of the other players become more grating than effective , after a good first impression .
452588	15896852	56891	6.0	Hello , Ann-Margret !	Don't expect this to be a faithful adaptation of the stage hit , starring Dick Van Dyke ( as Albert ) , with a black-wigged Janet Leigh ( as Rosie ) attractively shouting " Ole ! " Instead , this is a showcase for the delicious Ann-Margret ( as Kim ) . Ms . Margret , with the co-operation of director George Sidney , pulls the rug out from under everyone and everything in sight . Although miscast ( " a child of fifteen " ! ) as a star-struck teenager , Ms . Margret is a delight . Watching her perform must have made moviegoers feel like star-struck teenagers . The thirtysomething ( but drafted ! ) " Elvis " - inspired Jesse Pearson ( as Conrad Birdie ) suffers , in comparison . But , so do most of the cast ? Though nowhere near as successful as it should be , " Bye Bye Birdie " is worth watching . Most of all , for Ann-Margret's breakout performance as a 1960s sex symbol . The production number " A Lot of Living to Do " ( perhaps inspired by Presley's similarly titled " Loving You " tune ) easily goes to the head of the class - with Ann-Margret , Bobby Rydell ( as Hugo ) , and troupe performing admirably and energetically . Ironically , Mr . Rydell is successfully cast . In " real life " , Rydell was the type of " teen idol " the film was unsuccessfully satirizing . The other musical numbers are fair to middling ( the " Moscow ballet " is poor ) . You do get to see Dick Van Dyke " Put on a Happy Face " ( in his first feature film ) , and Paul Lynde's observations on " Kids ! " - but , both performers improved upon the renditions offered herein . Matronly Maureen Stapleton adds some weight to the cast . Ed Sullivan fills a flattering supporting role . All things considered , it's Ann-Margret's " really big shew " , with Rydell and the production's " kids " doing their best to help out .

453085	15896852	98230	6.0	From Flashback to Déjà Vu	In 1969 , peace loving hippies Eric Roberts ( as Fred ) and Cheech Marin ( as Hesus ) flee to Central America , to avoid being drafted into Vietnam War service . Why the US government believes Mr . Marin would be of any real use during warfare is never explained ; but , Mr . Roberts looks like a major Commie-killing loss . Anyway , they spend the next 20 years hiding in the jungle , smoking marijuana , and enjoying peace . Their hippie friends , Julie Hagerty ( as Petra ) and Robert Carradine ( as Sammy ) , remain behind . While in Central America , Roberts and Marin learn about a US invasion plan , and decide to return to New York , and stop the war . They are in for a rude awakening . . . In 1989 , the peace movement appears dead . Roberts and Marin try to adapt to the changes in American society . They try to re-connect with Ms . Hagerty and Mr . Carradine , who have become materialistic yuppies . How can they erase their friends ' 1980s brainwashing , avoid capture by perseverating FBI man Cliff De Young ( as Brubaker ) , and stop the war ? Aaron Russo and Neil Levy's underrated " Rude Awakening " certainly doesn't always work ; but , it's funny more often than not . Roberts and Marin are almost a satirical casting in-joke ( sixties , meet the eighties ) . One of the film's most obvious misses is that the main attempt to transcend a 20-year-gap is an unconvincing pair of pasted-on beards . Although , to answer Roberts ' later , more general question , " How's my hair ? " Great . It's impossible to hold back laughing at Marin's first meeting with the " fish " . But , they should have used Don Knotts voice . Of the four " hippie " friends , Carradine's is , performance-wise , most convincing . Check out Louise Lasser ( as Ronnie ) ' s customers ! The highlight of the film is a terrific " cocktail party " hosted by Carradine and uptight wife Cindy Williams ( as June ) . They are visited by the " Stools " , Buck Henry ( as Lloyd ) and Andrea Martin ( as April ) . A cocktail party attended by Cheech Marin , Eric Roberts , Robert Carradine , Buck Henry , Cindy Williams , and Andrea Martin is every bit as funny as it sounds . If only they could have figured out how to get Lasser there ( and the overhead mike out ) . There are enough funny moments , all around ; but , the hilarious supporting characterizations by Martin and Williams , alone , make this well worth watching .

Searching this new found subterranean passage , our heroes are surprised to find the lost city of Atlantis . Ruling over this fantastic underworld realm , an evil queen sets her sights upon these strangers to her kingdom , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . To begin , Legionnaire John Stuart ( as André de Saint-Avit ) responds to modern speculation about the lost city of Atlantis by proclaiming he and partner Gustav Diessl ( as Jean Morhange ) actually visited the legendary city . A flashback recounts the men being kidnapped , and brought to Atlantis ; it is still in existence , a labyrinth beneath the Sarah Desert . Beautiful and bewitching Brigitte Helm ( as Antinea ) is the city's ruler ; descended from ancient queens , she has an insect-like agenda for the men caught in her web . Extraordinarily directed ( by G . W . Pabst ) and photographed ( by Eugen Schüfftan and Ernst Körner ) , " The Mistress of Atlantis " offers a lot of eye-appeal ; but its storyline suffers considerably , in comparison . Searching for information on Pierre Benoit's original novel , " L'Atlantide " , will uncover the sexuality buried in the mix . Ms . Helm and Mathias Wieman ( as Ivar Torstenson ) heat things up a little , however . " Die Herrin von Atlantis " ( 1932 ) , the German version , must be considered definitive .

Wallace Beery ( as Bill Hawkes ) , the " Stool Pidgeon " who played a part in her father's death , raises Ms . Dean to be an accomplished London pickpocket . Meanwhile , enterprising Mr . Griffith scams pawns as " The Mechanical Chess-player " . Mr . Beery , who calls himself " Count Donelli " invites Griffith to join himself and Dean . Soon , the unholy trio travel to New York's Fifth Avenue ; there , they plan their biggest heist . Tod Browning's " White Tiger " is entertainingly performed , and directed . Later in the running time , Matt Moore ( as Richard Longworth ) makes the troupe a fine acting quartet . The story situation requires too great a suspension of disbelief , however . You'll may wonder why Griffith and Dean don't dope things out sooner ( just for starters ) . The " White Tiger " referred to in the title is , by the way , the criminal element that lives in the heart of the unholy criminal : " Fawning and hating the strong , ready to ravage the weak , faithless ? suspicious ? cruel and savage , fearing no God ? trusting no man ? that's White Tiger in the heart of the crook !

Upon graduation , Ms . Stanwyck gets a job as " Night Nurse " to a pair of plump looking children ; she suspects the well fed looking kids are being starved to death , possibly by their drunken mother's gangster lover Clark Gable ( as Nick , the chauffeur ) . Soon , Stanwyck is in great danger ? Delightfully lurid melodrama , with star Stanwyck in fine form ( she and Blondell are seen are often shown undressing , by the way ) . Full of things they couldn't do , say , or show in movies after the Hays Production Code began enforcing its standards on all motion pictures released on or after July 1 , 1934 . Today , it's a fun William A . Wellman directed film .

Salisbury has a fondness for betting on the horses , and pilfers money from the fund . For the sake of family honor , Mr . Farnum accepts responsibility for the missing funds , and sails off to America . Farnum buys a ranch , befriends the local Indians ( Native Americans ) , and feuds with wicked William Elmer ( as Cash Hawkins ) . When Salisbury dies , on the Swiss Alps , widow Winifred Kingston ( as Diana ) wants to bring Farnum home to England , but he's settled in America with Squaw Red Wing ( as Nat-u-ritch ) ? Due to its relatively long length , this is sometimes called the first feature film . It is also the noted as first feature filmed in Hollywood , California ; but , you wouldn't know it - the Farnum ranch looks like Hollywood ( check out the background ) , but the more memorable ship trek and heavy snowfall scenes can't be Hollywood ( obviously ) . It's the first film by director Cecil B . DeMille , who shows some promise ( in hindsight ) . There are no great performances ; Dustin Farnum was an important stage actor , getting acquainted with film . I thought Farnum was best and most impressive in the scenes with his " half-breed " son ( who looks NOTHING like his Indian mother ) . Billy Elmer was entertaining in what should have been a larger role ( Cash Hawkins ) . I found " The Squaw Man " confusing - some of the events and relationships are like . . . " fill in the blanks " . The Indian / Englishman relationship was , perhaps , daring for an early film theme ( if you can figure out what's going on ) ; and , Ms . Wing was a real Winnebago Indian actress . The Squaw Man ( 1914 ) Cecil B . DeMille , Oscar Apfel - Dustin Farnum , Red Wing , William Elmer

Mr . Veidt receives an offer of exoneration from ruthless and powerful Raymond Massey ( as Cardinal Richelieu ) ; but , he must first capture Mr . Massey's enemy , a revolutionary Duke . Veidt manages to install himself as a guest in the Duke's castle , with its master away . While waiting for his prey to return , Veidt becomes smitten with the Duke's sister , Annabella ( as Lady Marguerite ) . Notable as Victor Sjöström final film as director ; and , the direction of " Under the Red Robe " is certainly a highlight . The performances of the three leads are also excellent , intensified by Mr . Sjöström , a master filmmaker . Unfortunately , this re-make of a 1923 swashbuckling silent doesn't offer very much action , which doesn't help its already slow-moving story . Romney Brent ( as Marius ) contrasts the intense lead performances , as Veidt's light-heeled lackey . Under the Red Robe ( / 37 ) Victor Sjöström - Conrad Veidt , Annabella , Raymond Massey

Rogers and company find lawlessness in Tombstone , led by corrupt Mayor Addison Richards and wayward Sheriff Harry Woods . Jay Novello steals away with all acting honors as John Anderson aka Joe Martinez ; Mr . Novello is dialect-able , makes terrific getaways - and , he is more fun to watch than the cute kids , the granny , and the love interest for Rogers . Novello's versatility is very much appreciated in this film . By the way , the film closes with a suggestion Rogers is about to do some major neckin ' with Elyse Knox ( as Mary ) . Rogers and Ms .

After consulting with a Priest , Mr . Holmes decides to visit the man's family , in Germany . Holmes intends to confess his act , and clear his Christian conscience . But , the dead soldier's family mistake Holmes for friend of the deceased , after learning he's been bringing flowers to Mr . Holderlin's grave . Eventually , the dead man's father , Lionel Barrymore ( as Dr . Holderlin ) , accepts Holmes as almost a replacement son . Then , Holmes falls in love with pretty Nancy Carroll ( as Elsa ) , the fiancée of the man he killed ? Ms . Carroll and Holmes were more memorable in " The Devil's Holiday " ( 1930 ) ; and , Carroll was runner-up in the " Academy Award " for " Best Actress " for the 1929-30 eligibility period . But , here , Carroll doesn't have anywhere near the screen time or script she needed to make a like impression . The more focal relationship is between " son " Holmes and " father " Barrymore . Holmes is the lead actor ; and , with direction from Ernst Lubitsch , performs in a manner that sometimes seems over-the-top , but was favored by many " serious " actors during the early 1930s . Still , Mr . Lubitsch contributes memorable moments , and the opening montage is terrific . The film's thesis is out of fashion is some ways , but is nevertheless interesting .

Meanwhile , an angel of God invites Joseph , a son of David , to wed Mary . The angel explains that Mary's child is the savior Jesus Christ , who will grow up to save his people from their sins . The child grows up without fanfare ; but , as an adult ( Robert Henderson-Bland ) , Christ assembles disciples , and begins performing miracles . He is persecuted for his beliefs ; and , finally , he is crucified . For its time , a very good version of the often told story of Jesus Christ . Director Sidney Olcott and photographer George Hollister do very well ; their scenes with Mary , Joseph , and young Jesus in Egypt are a beautiful example . It's nice to see the scenes with Jesus as a child ; and , note the one where he carries a stick of lumber foreshadows the crucifixion . Mr . Henderson-Bland acts the part very well ; he is subdued , and looks comfortable in the role . Ms . Gauntier , who assisted Mr . Olcott greatly throughout the production , was certainly the film's most valuable player . The miracles scenes are very silly looking , and acted ; although , to be honest , I haven't seen enough people " raised from the dead " to judge the antics on screen . The " walking on water " might have worked if the water was a little calmer . There should have been more story explanation given for it , but the crucifixion elicited passion . Not the first " feature " film , but an important one ; for its lovely Egypt , Palestine , and Ireland location scenes . " From the Manger to the Cross " is the peak production from the early " Kalem " film company . Notably , it omits the resurrection ( some versions add it , from another film ) .

They were responsible for many memorable character roles ( mostly ) in silent films ( mostly ) ; and they are in excellent form , reprising their " Covered Wagon " roles . Cooper obviously enjoys working with them . Ms . Damita is cute and effective .

Vain , selfish , and very attractive ; Ms . Davis prefers to string her suitors along . During one cocktail hour gathering , Davis discovers her ne'er-do-well brother Richard Waring ( as Trippy Trellis ) has been embezzling funds from Jewish banker Claude Rains ( as Job Skeffington ) . To shield her beloved brother from prosecution , Davis endeavors to wed the ultra-wealthy Mr . Rains . Rains , like most men , has worshiped Davis from afar ; but , she is unable to change her coquettish lifestyle . " The most difficult aspect of the character Fanny was ( that ) she was a famous beauty of her day , " Davis observed , " I was far from being beautiful . " Yet , Davis , with her strength of personality and acting prowess , pulls off the role ; she is , as always , a great one to watch . Rains also performs well ; but , his is more of a supporting role , despite playing the title role . Walter Abel ( as George Trellis ) gets a lot of good camera time , also . And , George Coulouris is exceptional , as Davis ' astute psychoanalyst . " Mr . Skeffington " is a relatively long film , in its " restored " length . Davis and Rains were nominated for " Academy Awards " in the " Best Actress " and " Supporting Actor " categories .

In the town of " Willard " , pre-teen K'Sun Ray ( as Timmy Robinson ) lives with parents Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker ( as Helen and Bill Robinson ) . Alas , the Robinsons are the only family on their street who do not own a zombie ; their new neighbors , the Bottoms , have six . So , to keep up , the Robinsons obtain zombie Billy Connolly ( as Fido ) . Unfortunately , Mr .

Meanwhile , young Ray has grown attached to Connolly ( the boy and his zombie are like TV's " Timmy and Lassie " ) and , the Robinson family find it difficult to cooperate with the controlling " Zomcom " authorities . " Fido " doesn't go far enough into its own intriguing " Wild Zone " ; but , it is a colorful , stylish , and amusingly satirical addition to zombie film lore . Ray and the cast perform well , individually ; with nubile zombie Sonja Bennett ( as Tammy ) and owner Tim Blake Nelson ( as Theopolis ) the most memorable pair .

But neither Spencer nor Jillian know that those 120 seconds of terror will ultimately threaten their sanity , their future and their lives in this heart stopping psychological thriller the critics call , ' One scary edge-of-the-seat nightmare ' , " according to the film's official synopsis . Everything you see about this movie gives away the story ; the trailer makes the plot obvious , and every other critic compares it to " Rosemary's Baby " ( 1968 ) . Indeed , it is an updated version of Roman Polanski's classic , with Aliens substituted for Satan - the old devil has clearly been replaced as top villain , after his 1960s-1970s heyday . Although nothing is outlined , anyone with rudimentary knowledge about plotting will figure out what's happening in " The Astronaut's Wife " ; its flaw is that it takes no real risks . Even the swipe has been done . Ms . Theron is the lead . She and Mr . Depp look great ( eyebrow and hair color are perfect ) , but Theron only has a couple of scenes approaching the level of Mia Farrow's characterization in " Rosemary's Baby " . She looks almost too good during her pregnancy , whereas Ms . Farrow looked more and more sickly . Director Rand Ravich shows promise more as a director than writer . Allen Daviau's photography is excellent . The film is so derivative it dims the impact of some excellent supporting performances , led by a dazzling Joe Morton ( as Sherman Reese ) . The moronic ending should be chopped off and sent to deleted scenes hell . . . before that , the film's strengths outweigh its weaknesses .

W . Bitzer . It was directed by Wallace McCutcheon . Mr . Harron started playing " bit " parts at the studio in late 1907 as an after school job , with future film editor James Smith . Collaborator D . W . Griffith had yet to arrive . " Jim and I were earning five dollars a week , " Harron recalled in a February 8 , 1920 newspaper interview with Louella Parsons , " At that time , five dollars was considered a big salary for a boy . We were proud of ourselves until we started playing regular parts . And then , we used to hold indignation meetings , and say if the company didn't realize our value , we would leave ; a threat which never worried anyone , and which we never carried out . " Happily , the boys stayed with Biograph , and met director Griffith the following year ; thus , with Mr . Bitzer , the ingredients for movie magic were stirred . Unhappily , " Bobby's Kodak " is a lost film . Here is Harron's synopsis : " ' Bobby's Kodak ' was the title . I was the infant terrible , and I snapped my father kissing the maid , mother flirting with the butler , the nurse maid having an affair with the cop . Later , I showed all the pictures ; and , the pandemonium that followed has some of our best slapstick comedies looking lifeless . There was a chase - Edward Dillon played my father , and it was from his irate grasp I had to escape . " Bobby's Kodak ( 1908 ) Wallace McCutcheon - Robert Harron , Edward Dillon
452653	15896852	29440	7.0	Uneven Exchange	In the slums of 16th century London , young Billy Mauch ( as " Pauper " Tom Canty ) makes the most of his life as a beggar ; though , he is beaten by his father , and thrown in the mud . Meanwhile , royal Bobby Mauch ( as " Prince " Edward VI ) lives a life of luxury ; soon , he will replace father King Henry VIII on the throne . One evening , Pauper Mauch takes refuge from a storm on Prince Mauch's palace grounds . The look-alike boys meet , and strike up a friendship . Prince Mauch invites Pauper Mauch over to the palace , where the two become intrigued by their different lifestyles , and identical appearance . After they exchange clothing , they become separated , by happenstance . When nobody believes their stories , the boys are forced to assume each other's identities . This is a well-produced version of the Mark Twain classic . Sadly , the unevenly paced scenario does not produce the film classic which was , evidently , possible ( considering those involved ) . The " Mauch Twins " and Claude Rains ( as the Earl of Hertford ) are especially strong in their portrayals ; and , Erich Wolfgang Korngold's soundtrack should be noted . Don't expect to see top-billed Errol Flynn ( as Miles Hendon ) until later in the film , as a supporting player . Alan Hale , Barton MacLane , Henry Stephenson , and Montagu Love are also worth noting ; but , the film's main strengths are Mr . Rains , Mr . Korngold , and the " Mauch Twins " .

453362	15896852	20827	7.0	One Good Turn Deserves Another	Norma Shearer ( as Jerry Martin ) tests the freedom acceptable for men , but not permissible for women - the sexual " Double Standard " . As the film opens , Ms . Shearer is an happily married woman . However , husband Chester Morris ( as Ted Martin ) gets " plastered " , and succumbs to the advances of a sexually aggressive woman ? at least , that's what is discernible from the after-the-fact behavior of the adulterous duo , as Shearer catches them in a light embrace . Disillusioned , Shearer turns the tables by having a " one night stand " of her own - with one of the soon-to-be divorced couple's pals . In a film themed like Greta Garbo's recent " The Single Standard " ( 1929 ) , MGM takes another shot at the sexual " Double Standard " . The results are similar , but not the same . Shearer's winning performance is bold , fascinating , and fun to watch ; she elevates the character far above the material . The film's problem is that it pulls its punches with a disappointing ending , extinguishing a truly interesting story . Yet , somehow , Shearer makes the character ring true . It's a strong performance , which manages to rise above the film's abandonment of its thesis . Director Robert Z . Leonard , writer John Meehan , and a fine supporting cast are a great help . Robert Montgomery's performance ( as Don ) is a standout . And , Conrad Nagel ( as Paul ) is another Shearer castoff , who has a potable problem ; he has a harrowing car crash near the film's opening . A lot of alcohol is consumed in this movie ! " The Divorcée " is a flawed , but worthwhile film . The Divorcée ( 1930 ) Robert Z . Leonard - Norma Shearer , Chester Morris , Robert Montgomery
452548	15896852	27518	7.0	Three Hoodlum Musketeers	Great opportunity to see three of the biggest child actors of the 1930s , at different stages in their careers . The 1930s started with Jackie Cooper on top ; then , mid-decade , Freddie Bartholomew ruled ; and , finally , Mickey Rooney reigned . This film was made during Mr . Bartholomew's peak of popularity . After some promising scenes , it becomes obvious Bartholomew , Cooper , and Rooney are not being well served by the production . Some of their scenes appear rushed ; at times , it looks as if they are rehearsing alongside each other , rather than acting together . Possibly , this is due to director W . S . Van Dyke being assigned to the film , after the firing of Rowland Brown . Mr . Van Dyke was known for his sometimes hurried direction . Still , the actors are professional , and earnest ; and , some on-screen rapport is in evidence . Rowland Brown's story is excellent - - much more realistic than several similar 1930s " young hoodlum " dramas . Rooney gets the best part ; and , naturally , he makes the most of it ; scene stealers Bartholomew and Cooper wouldn't have missed a similar opportunity . This is one of Rooney's best-written , best-performed early roles ; he is a terrific actor , and his portrayal of " Gig Stevens " should be more renown . Writer Brown , fired as the film's director , would go on to pen " Angels with Dirty Faces " . With some more care , this film might have been as classic .

Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter	Mickey Rooney ( as Mi Taylor ) is a young man drifting along the figurative road to ruin , where he meets 12-year-old Elizabeth Taylor ( as Velvet Brown ) - - she adores horses , but he has a sad history with the animals . Ms . Taylor is enamored with Mr . Rooney's horse-sense ; she takes him home , and gets him room and board with her family . They are supported very well by Anne Revere and Donald Crisp ( as Mr . and Mrs . Brown ) . Butch Jenkins and Angela Lansbury are Taylor's strained siblings . The plot of " National Velvet " is implausible to a fault ; for example , the circumstances leading to Taylor's ride in the " Big Race " are quite a stretch ( but were likely more believable on paper ) . Still , the characters ' connection to horses , and to Ms . Revere's character are nicely conceived . Rooney and Taylor are excellent in the starring roles ; there is a balance between Rooney's fading " child star " and Taylor's exuberant new " child star " , which adds depth to their characterizations . The excellent performances of Rooney and Taylor are further enhanced by fine direction , photography , and editing from Clarence Brown , Leonard Smith , and Robert Kern . A sentimental classic .

452824	15896852	32022	8.0	John Garfield Gets in the Ring for Billy Halop and " The Dead End Kids "	After winning a championship fight , boxer John Garfield ( as Johnnie Bradfield ) celebrates with a drinking binge , which leads to the manslaughter of a pushy reporter . Although his manager killed the man , Mr . Garfield is blamed . When the manager dies in a car crash , wearing Garfield's stolen watch , authorities think the boxer is dead . Still a WANTED man , Garfield changes his identity to " Jack Dorney " and moves to an Arizona ranch . There , Garfield meets " The Dead End Kids " : Billy Halop ( as Tommy ) , Bobby Jordan ( as Angel ) , Leo Gorcey ( as Spit ) , Huntz Hall ( as Dippy ) , Gabriel Dell ( as T . B . ) , and Bernard Punsly ( as Milt ) . Garfield bonds with the young " Dead End " lads , who were sent to stay with sweet " Grandma Rafferty " ( May Robson ) as an alternative to reform school , courtesy of her brother , deceased priest " Father Rafferty " . Garfield falls in love with Halop's sister , pretty " Peggy " ( Gloria Dickson ) , who is there to keep any eye on the kids . Of course , Garfield's past comes back to haunt him ? " John Garfield and The ' Dead End ' Kids " make beautiful ( Max Steiner ) music together , thanks to effective direction and photography , by Busby Berkeley and James Wong Howe . The story is predictably comfortable , with the Warner Brothers support team in fine form . Garfield and the " Dead End " kids are a winning combination ; although Garfield made no further movies with the " East Side " gang , the studio had him re-team with both Billy Halop and Bobby Jordan , almost immediately , for " Dust Be My Destiny " . The boxing scenes are nicely staged . But , the most exciting sequence has Garfield and four of the New York " Kids " ( Halop , Jordan , Hall , and Punsly ) climbing into a giant water tank for a swim - which unexpectedly puts their lives in danger . Other , more brief , highlights include floozy Ann Sheridan ( as Goldie ) , boozy Barbara Pepper ( as Budgie ) , and young Ronald Sinclair ( as Douglas ) losing at strip poker .

453606	15896852	55184	8.0	Bottoms Up ! ( ? or Meat Is Murder ? )	In Reno , Nevada , voluptuous Marilyn Monroe ( as Roslyn Taber ) obtains a divorce ; then , she attracts the attention of three boozing cowboys : Clark Gable ( as Gay Langland ) , Montgomery Clift ( as Perce Howland ) , and Eli Wallach ( as Guido ) . Mr . Gable emerges as Ms . Monroe's ( and the film's ) leading man ; he leads the group on a hunting quest for flesh , explaining , " Nothing can live unless something dies . " Mr . Clift and Mr . Wallach agree with Gable . But , sensitive Monroe believes meat is murder . So , apparently , does Monroe's motherly landlady Thelma Ritter ( as Isabelle Steers ) ; however , she begs off the expedition early on , to join an ex-husband . The cast is extraordinary ; and , adding director John Huston and writer Arthur Miller to the mix guarantees a very interesting motion picture experience . " The Misfits " falls short , but not by much . Despite the fact that Mr . Miller must have written the story with Monroe ( then , his wife ) in mind , the main character is played by Gable - that is , if you consider the fact that his character undergoes the greatest transformation , in reaction to Monroe's character . And , Gable , performs the part very nicely . More importantly , he displays a dramatic , " modern " acting prowess , which might have served him well through the 1960s . Of course , that potential went unrealized when Gable suddenly died . In part , his heart attack was attributed to Gable's work in " The Misfits " . This is one film where the personal lives of the cast , director , and writer adversely affects what you see on the screen . The most " negative " result is Monroe's characterization ; she obviously needed more time with the role . Watch , for example , the scene with Monroe and Ritter , which plays after Gable walks off calling his dog ( " Tom Dooley " ) . As the women turn a corner , Monroe has to steady herself . It's a slight , almost unnoticeable misstep ; and , honestly , one which should have been re-shot . Probably , Monroe was so often indisposed , Mr . Huston had to do the best with what he had . It's a shame , because Monroe's acting is not at all inadequate . A particularly good moment to watch for is her " truck ride " , with Wallach ; in this scene , Monroe is exceptional . Another good scene includes Monroe using her real voice , listen to her say , " I don't care about the lettuce ! " At other times , Monroe appears very disconnected ; often , she seems to be acting alongside , rather than with , her co-stars . Gable , Monroe , Clift , and Ritter are certainly convincing as heavy drinkers . Interestingly , Clift uses his " personal demons " to good acting advantage ; whatever he was going through , privately , fit the character ; and , he manages to essay the film's most consistently convincing performance . If " The Misfits " were more successful , Clift might have been nominated as a " Best Supporting Actor " for his role . Also award-worthy is Alex North's perfect musical score . The ending lines , uttered by Gable and Monroe , are quite touching . . . indeed , the stars are out tonight . The Misfits ( 1961 ) John Huston - Clark Gable , Marilyn Monroe , Montgomery Clift
452937	15896852	183649	8.0	Smooth Operator	Captivating director Joel Schumacher imprisons cocky publicist Colin Farrell ( as Stu Shepard ) in a Manhattan " Phone Booth " for almost the entire length of this eighty minute movie - and , the result approaches amazing . Mr . Schumacher's cinematic sense , and willingness to experiment , is worth of comparisons with Alfred Hitchcock . Most obviously , this film is " Rear Window " in reverse . Note how successfully both directors keep you , and their protagonists , is their opposite settings . Of course , Mr . Hitchcock ( for a small sample of his " phone booth " usage , see " The Birds " ) would have done several things differently in a feature-length " Phone Booth " . For example , the " menacing " toy near the beginning of the film would certainly have been owned by an annoying kid . And , the film's moral compass ends up strangely askew . Still , Schumacher , cast , and crew keep you on the line . Phone Booth ( / 02 ) Joel Schumacher - Colin Farrell , Kiefer Sutherland , Forest Whitaker
453053	15896852	68286	9.0	First You Must Learn How to Kill	I put the tape in , made a quick trip to the refrigerator , and returned to find six guys acting like they were animals , being massacred by hunters . Curses ! I thought the tape hadn't been re-wound - - and , I was watching the ending . BUT , it was only a nightmare . This IS how the film begins . . . Barry Robins ( as " Cotton " ) wakes up , all right , in his " Box Canyon Boys Camp " cabin . Mr . Robins rounds up his troops ; then , they head out to save the buffalo ? and civilization . The opening " flashback " is appropriately disturbing . More importantly , it clearly and directly relates the teenagers at the " Boys Camp " to caged animals . Further flashbacks tell the story of how the six " emotionally disturbed " kids are put out , by failed parents , to be either housed or " corrected " . The camp's motto is : " Send Us A Boy ? We'll Send You A Cowboy " ! The prospective cowboys , corralled by leader Robins , are : stoner Bill Mumy ( as " Teft " ) , comedian Miles Chapin ( as " Shecker " ) , fairy Darel Glaser ( as Goodenow ) , and feuding siblings Bob Kramer ( as " Lolly 1 " ) and Marc Vahanian ( as " Lolly 2 " ) . The entire cast performs well , with Robins and Mr . Mumy more obviously standing out . Watch for a great scene , after the travelers ' " Pest Control " truck , hot-wired by Mumy , runs out of gas . Robins tries to start the truck ; and , his hopeless efforts trigger an important " flashback " . Imaginatively directed , by Stanley Kramer , we see Robins through his mother's vanity mirror , applying make-up for a young date . When Robins threatens to reveal his mother's age , she responds , " I'll kill you . . . " Telling . Another important , well-played , sequence occurs with Mr . Glaser's last " flashback " - - to when he was " cast out " of his cabin . Branded a " sissy " for bed wetting , Glaser is humiliated , and attempts suicide . Robins is the boy's Savior ; he raises " Goodenow " from a drowning pool to the " Bedwetters " cabin , where introductions are made . This part of the film might have been better placed earlier , as it so effectively " introduces " the individual characters , and cinematically ties them together as a team . While this is a " non-linear " film , there are editing / continuity problems ( real and speculative ) ; hopefully , a better cut version of " Bless the Beasts & Children " can be found . The music is outstanding : both the instrumental theme by Barry DeVorzon and Perry Botkin Jr . , and the vocals " Bless the Beasts and the Children " ( by Carpenters ) and the ill-titled " It's a Beautiful Day " by co-star Mumy ( written with Paul Gordon ) .

453534	15896852	36868	9.0	Nothing But the Best	This is a great film from director William Wyler , cast and crew . I agree with so many of the prior comments . The film's appeal - represented early on by amputee Harold Russell - is that this is going to be a realistic depiction of post-war comings home . Mr . Russell , Mr . March , and Mr . Andrews make a great team , and each give great performances . Russell is an amputee , March has an alcohol problem , and Andrews shows some post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms . The film shows them adjusting , or not adjusting , to civilian life . Myrna Loy is wonderful to watch ? especially , her eyes . The background / foreground action is nice . I noticed that March and the others do not look like they've missed all that much shaving , despite the script . In fact , March's moustache looks very neatly trimmed , to me . My major criticism is , after starting as a " realistic " drama , the film ends with a glossy " happy ending " . The servicemen's differing problems are all too conveniently . . . gone . The movie becomes less a realistic drama and more a Fantasy Hollywood Movie . It becomes way , way too sentimental . It's , still , incredibly well-presented sentimentality . I think its closeness to the actual war being represented both adds and detracts from the film . I'm sure audiences benefited from this movie greatly during release - but , it was too soon for an honest reflection . Instead of it's goal , I think the film becomes an essential American time capsule . It shows the mood of the country in a way , today , the filmmakers were perhaps not expecting - and , it's sentimentally perfect Hollywood ending is no less valuable than gritty real life dramas .

452604	15896852	97714	9.0	Tra-La-La ( and The Killing of Georgie , Part I )	A startling trip into the lower-class bowels of the fourth largest city in the world , circa 1952 . This is the film version of Hubert Selby Jr . ' s unrelentingly pessimistic 1964 novel " Last Exit to Brooklyn " . In the film medium , the material makes a sideways , but successful , impression ; this is an exceptional drama . There are many great sub-plots , and performances ; but , mainly , the film focuses on the character stories involving beautiful young prostitute Jennifer Jason Leigh ( as Tral ) , and striking bisexual union leader Stephen Lang ( as Harry Black ) . Writer Selby has said , " Sometimes , we have the absolute certainty that there's something inside us that's so hideous and monstrous that , if we ever search it out , we won't be able to stand looking at it . But , it's when we're willing to come face to face with that demon , that we face the angel . " Selby's brutal , heart-wrenching treatment of its characters would not have been as successful a film without an extraordinary look at the " angel face " referred to in his quote . In a scene not in the book , young Cameron Johann ( as Spook ) , who has a teenage " crush " on Ms . Leigh , happens upon her drunken figure , after she is nearly raped to death . She is resurrected by his tear-stained face , and realizes her fling with soldier Frank Military ( as Steve ) provided fulfilling sexual intimacy . The scene implicitly offers salvation to Mr . Lang , who , after attempting sex with an underage boy , has been crucified . Still , the film can't shed some " dock-time " , for rancid sexual one-sidedness . Director Uli Edel , cinematographer Stefan Czapsky , editor Peter Przygodda , and musician Mark Knopfler are award-worthy . Jennifer Jason Leigh won several well-deserved awards , but no Oscar ; and , there are at least five performances worthy of a " Best Supporting Actor " nomination . From the central roles , to the smallest " walk on " player ; this film is an example of " ensemble acting " at its best . Its shocking content must have put off a lot of viewers , at the time ; yet , " Last Exit to Brooklyn " succeeds because its violence is not mindless .

453651	15896852	52618	9.0	Chariots of the Gods	Charlton Heston ( as Judah Ben-Hur ) grows up in Judea , around the same time as Jesus Christ . A wealthy Jew , Mr . Heston maintains his princely lifestyle , despite the Roman occupation of his land . After a number of years , Heston encounters old friend Stephen Boyd ( as Messala ) , a Roman . Heston soon discovers that politics does not , in every case , make strange bedfellows ; as Mr . Boyd is the steadfast leader of the occupying Roman forces . Soon , the political upheaval threatens Heston's freedom , and life ? " State-of-the-art " epic , from William Wyler and the outstanding MGM cast and crew . Relatively speaking , this film is not as " original " as the 1925 version ; still , it's a very worthy update , with superlative production values . With a few exceptions , the film looks very natural , unlike the increasingly tired animated " look " used for big productions some decades later . The film's lighting , scenes , and direction are very aesthetically appealing . The supporting characterizations are better than those in the older version . Christianity remains respectfully restrained ; arguably , the amount of Christian faith demonstrated by Heston is unnecessarily subdued . Heston takes some getting used to , as the young Jewish hero ; in fact , he looks more convincing as a Roman , especially after his " adoption " by Jack Hawkins ( as Quintus Arrius ) . An interesting , but unacceptable-at-the-time , idea might have been for Heston and Boyd to switch roles ; Boyd appears capable of handling either " Judah " or " Messala " . Still , Heston wins you over ; his scenes in the " slave boat " , and the reunification with his leper mother are outstandingly played . Boyd's characterization is extraordinary ; watching the way his eyes dart over Heston , in their first scenes together , lends credence to co-writer Gore Vidal assertion there was a homosexual subtext planned for the characters . Realistically , homosexual relations were not all that uncommon among the ancient Romans . Although , this was not likely to be found in the Lew Wallace novel , it does help explain the otherwise inexplicable love / hate relationship between the " Judah " and " Messala " characters . The entire supporting cast does very well , it must have been difficult for award nominators to single anyone out . But , in addition to those mentioned above , Haya Harareet's " Esther " and Hugh Griffith's " Sheik Ilderim " most definitely make an impression . The film's weakest moments occur during the very fake looking " sea battle " sequence ; surprisingly , the old 1925 version is much more consistently exciting . Both films ' " chariot races " are essential thrill rides . Ben-Hur ( 1959 ) William Wyler - Charlton Heston , Stephen Boyd , Jack Hawkins , Hugh Griffith
452565	15896852	105265	9.0	Gone Fishing	Craig Sheffer ( as Norman ) and Brad Pitt ( as Paul ) are Montana sons-of-a-preacher man Tom Skerritt ( as Reverend Maclean ) . You will immediately notice the breathtaking Montana scenery - photography by Philippe Rousselot , direction by Robert Redford , with an obviously adept cast and crew . The kids playing the younger Macleans were quite an asset ; I did recognize Joseph Gordon-Levitt in an impressive debut ( though not his first ) . As I was watching , I thought : well , it looks all nice , but what's happening ? I was unsure about the film's focus . The film is often slow and confusing , even if you are familiar with the Norman MacLean story ; and , this is a somewhat alternate version / vision of the original written work . And , I realized what I was watching . It happened twenty minutes ( or so ) after the kids " grew up " - this is the story of Norman Maclean's remembrances ? the touching stones of his life . They may not be the things you'd believe an old man remembers ; but , by the end of the film , you know . You'll understand the focus on his brother , with that magical quality that just slipped away ? Perhaps , there was no perfection there ; but , you'll know why Norman sees it . You'll know why that memory of the perfect fly fisherman is there . Just a few other thoughts : At the risk of over-analyzing , I felt the characters of Norman , Paul , their father , and Redford merging into ONE character at the end of the film ; I wonder if Redford intended it that way ? His direction , narration , and lead performances seemed blend together ? Directing , Preaching , Fishing , the River - it all runs together ; and , we're all water . The end of the film is very powerful . A River Runs Through It ( 1992 ) Robert Redford - Brad Pitt , Craig Sheffer , Tom Skerritt , Brenda Blethyn
452643	15896852	289879	9.0	Come Back When You Grow Up	This review recommends you watch the " directors ' cut " before sampling the " theatrical version " of " The Butterfly Effect " . Also , it will also enhance the film's effect if you refrain from reading the comments , good and bad , until after viewing ; I was more intrigued by the storyline because I wasn't completely sure where the psychology and physics were going to wind up . The writer / director team of Eric Bress and J . Mackye Gruber kept me guessing as I did not read any comments , or even the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Bress and Gruber weave an extremely intricate , thought out , well paced , and imaginative drama . The protagonist is unstuck young " Evan Treborn " ( played by Ashton Kutcher , John Patrick Amedori , and Logan Lerman ) . The film traces the lives of Evan and three childhood friends : " Kayleigh " ( Amy Smart , Irene Gorovaia , and Sarah Widdows ) , " Tommy " ( William Lee Scott , Jesse James , and Cameron Bright ) , and " Lenny " ( Elden Henson , Kevin Schmidt , and Jake Kaese ) . Kayleigh and Tommy's abusive father ( Eric Stoltz ) , and Evan's loving mother ( Melora Walters ) are the main parental figures . To say the cast exceeds expectations would be an understatement . The overall effect left by the interrelating performances is remarkable , and rarely achieves at the level evident . This is also a technically beautiful film . Be prepared . The character " George Miller " is a pedophile , who has obviously abused his children ( off screen ) . " Mr . Miller " invites young Evan and his daughter to get undressed for his camera ; it is a non-erotic , tastefully filmed scene . But , the violence , especially between the young children , is disturbing to the extreme ; certainly , it shows the most devastating effects of child abuse . In the case of " The Butterfly Effect " , artistic license trumps irreparable damages . " I'll come back for you " indeed . The Butterfly Effect ( 2004 ) Eric Bress , J .

452733	15896852	43465	9.0	Unbecoming an Officer	Kirk Douglas is very effective as a police detective with an surprise connection to someone he encounters on the job . Mr . Douglas ' performance is outstanding ; and , the supporting players all move around him like a finely tuned clock . Of them , I thought William Bendix was superb , very natural - everyone is fine , in fact , as directed by William Wyler . Of the little stories , I liked the young couple - the thief and girlfriend . I had to go to see the IMDb comments to find out what was happening in the film - I really couldn't understand some of the dialog Since the film deals with " issues " considered too delicate to really talk about in a movie , you have to really pay attention . To reveal more would spoil the film - but , its weakness is that it couldn't really be totally " realistic " due to the era when it was produced . Observe , for example , the amount of profanity uttered in that precinct ! The strongest word used is " tramp " . " Detective Story " does manage to bring its characters and story to the viewer , and scores points for realism ( despite some likely censorship ) . Keeping that in mind , it's an essential character study . Detective Story ( 1951 ) William Wyler - Kirk Douglas , Eleanor Parker , William Bendix , Lee Grant
453223	15896852	20025	9.0	The Sound of Silence	Working class Irishmen Lars Hanson ( as Gypo Nolan ) and Carl Harbord ( as Francis McPhillipp ) are members of an anti-establishment " Party " , where politics is punctuated with gunfire . While maintaining a friendship with his comrade , Mr . Hanson is obviously interested in Mr . Harbord's fickle moll , the lovely Lya de Putti ( as Katie Fox ) . After Harbord kills the local police chief ( during a gunfight ) he is driven underground ; leaving Ms . de Putti free to hook up with Hanson . Then , when Harbord surfaces to visit his mother , Hanson suspects he is seeing de Putti . So , Hanson becomes " The Informer " , hounded by detective Warwick Ward ( as Dan Gallagher ) . Fascinating , superb direction from Arthur Robison , and gorgeous photography from Theodor Sparkuhl and Werner Brandes , highlight this undiscovered classic . Director Robison and crew are always moving the picture ; even a background window is filled - - if only with the shadows of passing figures . The crowds of people are a moving backdrop for the film's atmospheric array of shadows , alleys , streets , police , and prostitutes . Although " The Informer " is labeled " A British International Picture " , it might more accurately be described as a " German Film Noir " . John Ford re-made " The Informer " in 1935 ; and , obviously , he was influenced by this version . Heavily accented leading players Hanson ( Swedish ) and de Putti ( Hungarian ) found their film careers killed by talking pictures , regrettably . Their performances are excellent ? . . . then . . . After about 45 minutes , the film changes from " silent " to " talking " . The switch works as a dramatic device ; although , it certainly couldn't have been planned by cast and crew . More probably , the studio ordered the change , as the popularity of all-silent films plummeted . The decision might have been a sound one ; however , the voices dubbing Hanson and de Putti are inadequate . A restoration of " The Informer " , with improved dubbing , could remedy the situation . The eerie " your mother has forgiven me " ending , with Hanson achieving Salvation , must remain , however . If , for some reason , you feel inclined to leave this version of " The Informer " unfinished , don't dare miss the last few minutes of work from actor Hanson and director Robison .
453471	15896852	14532	9.0	Church of the Poison Mind	Cecil B . DeMille's Paramount EPIC " The Ten Commandments " tells the Old Testament's " Moses " story during its first hour . The " special effects " highlights are : Theodore Roberts ( as Moses ) parting the Red Sea , and the Biblical patriarch's thunderous receiving of God's commandments . The production is first rate throughout . After about fifty minutes of spectacle , the film switches to a " Modern Story " - wherein Mr . DeMille seeks to tell a morality story involving " The Ten Commandments " . For the main story ( the more memorable Moses segments were a mere " prologue " ) , DeMille introduces the McTavish brothers - saintly carpenter Richard Dix ( as John ) , and partying atheist Rod La Rocque ( as Dan ) . While Mr . Dix stays home to read The Bible , with dear mother Edythe Chapman ( as Martha McTavish ) , Mr . La Rocque breaks Commandments , with lovely Leatrice Joy ( as Mary Leigh ) . Of course , Dix falls in love with Ms . Joy , after she becomes his brother's wife ? DeMille's morality tale is extremely heavy-handed , but nevertheless enticing , and expertly directed . The " Biblical " and " Modern " story format recalls D . W . Griffith's superior " Intolerance " ( 1916 ) . The all-star cast ( it's 1923 , remember ) performs exceptionally , with La Rocque being seen in one of his finest performances . As any actor will tell you , La Rocque was halfway there , upon receiving the " bad brother " role , over Dix - and , La Rocque runs away with the film . His is a " Best Actor " - worthy performance . Nefarious Nita Naldi ( as Sally Lung ) leads a strong supporting cast . All things considered , this one's a lot more fun than the 1956 re-make .

The story ( and much about the film ) is excellent . Certainly , the writers deserved recognition for the intriguing story , and complex characters . But , to see " The Naked Spur " was NOT nominated for " Best Color Cinematography " is shocking . William Mellor's photography is truly superior . Perhaps , they felt one nomination was enough for a movie about greed . James Stewart ( as Howard Kemp ) , Janet Leigh ( as Lina Patch ) , Robert Ryan ( as Ben Vandergroat ) , Ralph Meeker ( as Roy Anderson ) , and Millard Mitchell ( as Jesse Tate ) are an outstanding Colorado quintet . With Mann and Mellor directing , the small cast appears sprawling . Of the five , Mr . Ryan's intensely malevolent " Ben " reigns supreme ; it's difficult to envision " The Naked Spur " without Ryan's psychological thorn throwing . Recipient Stewart is also at his best . The other three are great ; though , more should have been to done develop and / or explain the relationship . Leigh had / has with Ryan and Stewart ; she is underused . That , and a couple of continuity and / or editing problems may distract , slightly . We shouldn't be to be too greedy about great movies , after all .

When one of the group's trips reveals a bleak future for the human race , the government steps in to shut down their research . The researchers decide to travel forward in time to find the cause of the horrible accident that apparently will ruin the ecology and threaten the very existence of man , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Actually , the research scientists send young people to the future , to study the discovered ecological crisis ; and , the young men and women contemplate starting a futuristic civilization there . Watch for the lead actress Kelly Bohanan ( as Karen ) visit the dentist early in the running time ; she emerges as the film's main character . Without her metallic dental braces , Ms . Bohanan is able to join sister Caroline Hildebrand ( as Isa ) in time traveling exploration . Ms . Hildebrand and sister Bohanan nonchalantly take off their pants for the camera ; because , anything with metal ( like zippers or buttons ) must be put in the " Material Projection Department " for time travel . The women are very attractive , but nothing is gratuitous . The first scene with Hildebrand explains the rules of time travel to Bohanan is where the film first grabs you . It is absolutely ludicrous : two hippie-type women explaining time trip rules , in their underwear ; but , it is also absolutely believable . " Idaho Transfer " succeeds , at this " guidelines for travel " moment , because you are ( or should be ) putting your trust in the young travelers . It's obviously going to be a very unusual movie . Most of the characters ' dialogue helps explain events ; still , it's not always clear what is happening , or where . And , yet , the movie is never dishonest . Director Peter Fonda and writer Thomas Matthiesen create a very captivating , thought-provoking world , with its own rules . Mr . Fonda should consider directing more often ; and , with the so often neglected type of performances from this cast . Kevin Hearst ( as Ronald ) emerges as Bohanan's " leading man " ; and , Keith Carradine is most notable among the other players . Although Fonda undoubtedly guided them , it's surprising so few in the cast achieved later fame , especially Bohanan . The character " Karen " is where you will find the real story ; it's in her almost constant longing for a child . Bohanan's face , and Fonda's camera , capture the desire frequently . And , of course , it is not an easy prospect . " Ronald " may be homosexual and / or asexual , along with others . Although it is discussed , you won't see sex . The desire for children symbolizes hope for the future , which may not be likely , in this world . Instead , industry eats up , and ruins things , like the derelict car " Karen " and " Ronald " find . And , literally , the train Mr . Hearst discovers has " eaten " its skeletal passengers . The ending is a perfect culmination of events . The ecological and environmental issues addressed in " Idaho Transfer " were certainly ahead of the curve .

With masterful use of light and shadows , from cinematographer John Alton , " He Walked by Night " is one of the most visually striking films of the 1940s . Basehart's psychotic star performance is also award-worthy ; especially , after witnessing his character operate on himself , in close-up , to remove a bullet . The supporting cast is a treasure trove , among them : Roy Roberts as the determined police captain , Dorothy Adams as the loony lady on Brady's milk run , Whit Bissell as Basehart's bookish friend , Billy Mauch as the mugging head of a teen gang , and Jack Webb learning how to make " Dragnet " a west coast version of " The Naked City " . And , that's not all ; read the extended cast list on IMDb before watching , so you don't miss anyone !
453678	15896852	10193	9.0	Robert Harron's Last Hurrah	In the valley of Silver Waters , a peddler family has parked their wagon . " Little Nellie " ventures out into the woods , and unexpectedly witnesses a horrific crime - Martin Cain and his wife ( George Nichols and Josephine Crowell ) are raging against a poor immigrant woman they have obviously employed ; and , they inadvertently kill the woman . The violent act becomes a repressed memory for little Nellie . Ten years later , Lillian Gish ( as the grown up Nellie Jarvis ) is , once again , traveling through Silver Waters , with her ailing , widowed mother . After her mother dies ( " A life flowing out to mysterious uncharted seas . " ) , Ms . Gish meets Robert Harron ( as Jimmie Hilton ) , who lives nearby , with his poverty-stricken family . Mr . Harron's family helps Gish bury her mother ; and , with nowhere to go , she accepts their invitation to stay ? Harron is attracted to Gish ; and , they become inseparable . Harron's father George Fawcett ( as Robert Hilton ) is unable to work , due to disability . Precognizant mother Eugenie Besserer ( as Mrs . Hilton ) sees her favorite son Ralph Graves ( as John Hilton ) off to war , believing she will never see him again . To help out her financially strapped surrogate family , Gish seeks employment with Mr . and Mrs . Cain ; the memory of their evil deed is still repressed . Harron kisses Gish goodbye ; then , she moves in with the wicked Cains ? " The Greatest Question " is most notable as Robert Harron's last film ; he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on September 5 , 1920 . When Harron died ( " A life flowing out to mysterious uncharted seas . " ) , this film was still being widely exhibited . And , it's a representative role - the " boy next door " he played so well for director D . W . Griffith . Harron is charming and natural , in the role of Jimmie Hilton . His reflective look at Gish's departure , from behind his fence , is just what Gish was longing for in " True Heart Susie " ( 1919 ) . Robert Harron was one of the finest actor of his time ; his record of performances , and acting style , portended a great career in the coming decades . In hindsight , he looks like one of the few silent performers certain to make a natural transition to sound film performances . At the time of his death , Harron had signed with Metro , where he worked on an unavailable film . There seems to be some controversy about whether or not Harron committed suicide ; if so , it could not have been due to an ongoing rivalry with actor Richard Barthelmess , over roles offered by director D . W . Griffith . By the time Harron died , both actors had left Griffith's company ; and , they remained friendly enough to attend the New York première of " Way Down East " ( 1920 ) . Ironically , " The Greatest Question " is about death ; and , Harron had a relatively unknown friend in New York , at that time , to attend the same " Way Down East " premiere - the soon famous , and also short-lived , Rudolph Valentino .

453428	15896852	27532	9.0	Mr . and Mrs . Dodsworth at Odds	Walter Huston ( as Sam Dodsworth ) and Ruth Chatterton ( as his wife , Fran ) are beginning their wedded " golden years " by taking a trip to Europe , as their daughter begins her own marriage . It's fairly obvious , early on , that Mr . Dodsworth loves Mrs . Dodsworth ; and , probably , he feels the European trip will enable the married couple to renew their relationship - - and grow closer , before growing old , together . It is also very clear , early on , that Mrs . Dodsworth is not " on board " ; in fact , her behavior is startlingly selfish and destructive . Mr . Huston and Ms . Chatterton perform very well as the Dodsworths . " Dodsworth " is a film to watch for performances , and they are very effective . Their characterizations are full enough for viewers to get an ever clearer picture of the Dodsworth marriage , as the film progresses . Chatterton , of course , participates in the unraveling , while Huston works for preserving of their marriage . Fran Dodsworth is a complicated part ; and , it is certainly a most unflattering choice of role for an actress in the 1930s - - this is probably a courageous role for Ruth Chatterton to accept , for the time . Of the supporting players , Mary Astor stands out as Mr . Huston's potential " other woman " - - the scene where Chatterton and Ms . Astor meet should not be missed ; watch the two actress ' faces and listen to the tone of their voices , for an extremely well-acted scene . William Wyler expertly directed the drama .

453571	15896852	169547	10.0	A Film with its Finger Firmly on the Pulse	" My name is Lester Burnham . This is my neighborhood . This is my street . This is my life . I am 42 years old . In less than a year , I'll be dead . Of course , I don't know that yet , and in a way , I'm dead already . Look at me . . . jerking off in the shower . This will be the high point of my day . It's all downhill from here . That's my wife Carolyn . See the way the handle on those pruning shears matches her gardening clogs ? That's not an accident . That's our next-door-neighbor Jim , and that's his lover Jim ? " That opening narration is a terrific invitation to " American Beauty " , a dead-on depiction of sexual fantasies and foibles in suburbia . Writer Alan Ball and director Sam Mendes construct an amazingly intuitive and artful picture . The cinematography ( Conrad L . Hall ) and music ( Thomas Newman ) are perfect . The entire cast is marvelous . Kevin Spacey plays his " Lester " to perfection - the moment when he decides NOT to indulge in a fantasy is just as uplifting as it would have been otherwise ; it is salvation .

453276	15896852	20030	10.0	Ho-LA ! ( Douglas Fairbanks ' Greatest Adventure )	Musketeer par excellence Douglas Fairbanks ( as D'Artagnan ) is back , in this extraordinary sequel to his " The Three Musketeers " ( 1921 ) . After some years , Mr . Fairbanks ' main job becomes protecting the French King's good son . Unbeknownst to most everyone ( except the movie audience ) , the Prince and heir to the throne , William Bakewell ( as Prince Louis XIV ) , has an evil twin brother ; the identical twosome were separated-at-birth , in order to assure one King ascended to the throne , without incident . However , " good " Prince Bakewell is abducted , and locked up in " The Iron Mask " ; then , " bad " Prince Bakewell takes his place . Fairbanks and his musketeer pals must set things right . With its superb acting , brilliant pace , and stunning photography , this is the one Douglas Fairbanks film you must see , if you only see one . " The Iron Mask " is among the best films in the swashbuckler and silent film genres . It's also ( probably ) Fairbanks ' best performance as an actor . His quintessential performance , and film , might have been overlooked for " Academy Award " consideration due to Fairbanks being , at the time , President of the Academy . It was also apparent , to Fairbanks and others , that the popularity of talking pictures would soon silence the older style , despite the artful late 1920s silent film productions . " The Iron Mask " featured a spoken word introduction ( with Fairbanks in fine voice ) ; currently , it is the rarer version . As the Fairbanks ' introductory words invite viewers into the " shadows of the past " , of a different " age " , it's worth seeking out the original introduction . Another version featured Douglas Fairbanks Jr . ' s narration , replacing intertitles ; this version is interesting , to a point . Note , eventually , the " narration " version becomes distracting and obvious . Fairbanks , with director Allan Dwan and photographer Henry Sharp , came up with an ending so memorable it's been said to symbolize the approaching end of its star's career , and the end of silent films in general . They could hardly have had a more suitable ending . For Douglas Fairbanks and company , " The Iron Mask " was a perfect fit .

453554	15896852	6864	10.0	A Most Extraordinary Film For the Ages	State-of-the-Art motion picture from director D . W . Griffith and company . This film requires a great deal of commitment , and concentration , in viewing . A good summation can be found in the words of " The Book " , which turns the pages on the historical eras depicted . Fleeting , and difficult to read during the film's running , the good folks at KINO include " The Book " in a special feature : " The book of this play is arranged in four parallel plot threads or lines of action , telling four stories with four sets of characters and dealing with four periods of history , all bearing on the one theme of intolerance . Intolerance is that thing in all of our nations which causes us to condemn all those who believe differently from ourselves . It has been the same in all ages , as far back as history goes . Intolerance as been the cause of more bloodshed than all other influences combined . How true it is that intolerance ever cloaks itself in the garb of righteousness that it may the more easily impose on the minds of men . " THE MODERN STORY ( 1916 ) : This is the main , and the finest , of the four stories . It begins with a group of women ( ironically called " Uplifters " ) promoting their " reformist " movement . " When women cease to attract men they often turn to Reform as a second choice " ; they embody the " garb of righteousness " being imposed , through the ages , on society . They become involved with the Jenkins family , millers , who run the town . THE JUDAEAN STORY ( Christ ) : This is the shortest of the four time slips ; it's the story of the betrayal and crucifixion of Jesus Christ . Griffith is wise to use Christ sparingly , as a compliment to his other stories ; to do more would have severely undermined this film , which needed to focus on the paralleled " crucifixion " ( hanging ) , in the " Modern Story " . THE FRENCH STORY ( 1572 ) : This Renaissance-era " hotbed of intolerance " Catholic / Protestant story further links Christianity ( or , depending on your beliefs , a misrepresentation of Christianity ) to the " Modern Story " of intolerance , social injustice , and self-righteousness . THE BABYLONIAN STORY ( 539 BC ) : This is the most visually stunning of the stories ; it links themes in the other stories ; and , importantly , it visually confirms " intolerance " as present throughout " ages " of history . Without " The Babylon Story " , the film would have left a much different impression , regarding religion and intolerance . Of the thousands of performers , the hero and heroine of " The Modern Story " must stand out , and they do : Robert Harron ( as The Boy ) and Mae Marsh ( as The Dear One ) are the stars of " The Modern Story " , and , so , they are the film's focus . Mr . Harron's performance is a masterpiece of screen acting . Ms . Marsh is perhaps too exuberant in some scenes , but equals Harron more often than not . The two , and their relationship , are the heart of the film ; their final reunion scene is heart-wrenching , and beautifully played ; amongst the thousands of extras , and millions of dollars , it's a film peak . Of the other " Modern " players , Miriam Cooper ( as The Friendless One ) stands out as a rival for Harron's affection ; instead , she finds herself fated to be the mistress of his gang boss Walter Long ( as The Musketeer of the Slums ) . Also noteworthy is Constance Talmadge ( as The Mountain Girl ) in " The Babylonian Story " ; like Marsh , she is sometimes too exuberant , which looks especially out of place during the battle scenes ; still , she makes an undeniable star-making impression . Elmer Clifton ( as The Rhapsode ) is noteworthy as her admirer ; enjoy the scene where he tries to get Ms . Talmadge to sit beside him ! Tully Marshall ( as The High Priest of Bel ) is always nice to see . Howard Gaye is a believable Christ in " The Judean Story " , and Margery Wilson ( as Brown Eyes ) is the focus of " The French Story " . There are numerous other performers , images , and moments ; the production levels are so high , Lillian Gish is employed to simply rock a cradle , between major time changes - - of course , she performs the task expertly ! Intolerance ( / 16 ) D . W . Griffith - Robert Harron , Mae Marsh , Constance Talmadge , Miriam Cooper
452810	15896852	18183	10.0	Mary Pickford Is " My Best Girl "	Mary Pickford ( as Maggie Johnson ) is a lowly " 5 & 10 cent " stockroom worker . One day , while covering a salesclerk's station , she encounters cute Charles " Buddy " Rogers ( as Joe " Grant " Merrill ) . Ms . Pickford thinks Mr . Rogers is a customer ; so , she tries to sell him on a Devil Doll - blowing it up for size ! The two are mutually attracted ; and , Rogers is happily assigned to be Pickford's stockroom ward . Pickford doesn't know it , but Rogers is actually millionaire store owner Hobart Bosworth ( as Robert E . Merrill ) ' s son , posing as a " commoner " in order to earn some business sense . Moreover , Rogers is engaged to marry his societal equal , Avonne Taylor ( as Millicent Rogers ) ? This was Pickford's final silent film ; and , in hindsight , she might have been wise to end her career right here , on top . " My Best Girl " is an indispensable film , one of several late 1920s films which show the silent film had achieved a considerable level of artistic sense . It's difficult to point out single pieces , since the entire film works so well ; however , the rainy location scenes are notably exquisite . Director Sam Taylor and Pickford shine throughout . Dave Kesson , Charles Rosher , and Jack Schulze make outstanding contributions . This is one of Pickford's finest performances ; and , she forms an extraordinary partnership with relative newcomer Rogers . Their scenes together are magical , rivaling the more rustic Lillian Gish / Robert " Bobby " Harron romances directed by D . W . Griffith . Pickford and Rogers later took the chemistry evident on film to heart , and formed a more long-term partnership ; their wedding and " newsreel " footage provide a lovely coda for " My Best Girl " . . . Life imitates art . My Best Girl ( / 27 ) Sam Taylor - Mary Pickford , Charles ' Buddy ' Rogers , Lucien Littlefield , Hobart Bosworth
452787	15896852	9796	10.0	The Slow Acid of Discontent ( Do You Hear Voices ? )	Raymond Hatton is " John Tremble - 2nd Assistant Cashier of the Clumley Contracting Company . " He hears voices from the Hall of Echoes . Kathlyn Williams is " Jane Tremble - his wife . " Eventually , she will hear voices of her own . Elliott Dexter is " ' Fighting ' George Coggeswell - A far-seeing young legislator who heads a commission with extraordinary powers to investigate the muddy waters of the state's politics . " He tilts the scale of justice with pipe ashes . Mr . Hatton is stuck in a $25 a week dead end job , with no hope for the future ; living with his mother ( Edythe Chapman ) he is unable to even buy a cheap little dress for Ms . Williams , for Christmas . To make ends meet , Mr . Hatton embezzles $10 . 000 from his company . Plagued by guilt ( and an investigation ) , Hatton drops out of sight , for a couple of days . Whilst fishing , he reels in a dead man , and decides to exchange identity with the deceased Edgar Smith . He becomes Smith , and very unwisely ( as it turns out ) frames him for both the Tremble embezzlement , and the murder of Tremble - so that he may achieve martyrdom . Then , he becomes a fugitive ? This is an epic psychological drama ; always interesting , it slowly becomes more and more unnerving , even horrific . The crescendo of images and plot build wildly , to an INTENSE ending . The film sometimes appears to be off-track , but winds up a tightly woven nightmare . There are SO MANY images to praise - but , just watch . . . Also , look for the cross-cutting as Hatton fishes for a dead body while Dexter fishes for Tremble - then , later , Tremble hooks up with a Chinatown prostitute while his wife marries Dexter . Director Cecil B . DeMille and the production team are in peak condition . Hatton , remembered mainly as a " supporting " or " character " actor , performs supremely in the lead role ; he effectively portrays the " slow acid of discontent steadily consuming " the soul of John Tremble . Williams shows some psychological problems of her own . Noah Berry has an important role as a longshoreman who guiltily houses Hatton , after unintentionally crippling him . It's difficult to believe this film was released in 1918 , and has received relatively little acclaim . It's a NOT TO BE MISSED silent classic . The Whispering Chorus ( 1918 ) Cecil B . DeMille - Raymond Hatton , Kathlyn Williams , Elliott Dexter , Noah Berry
452895	15896852	38057	10.0	Mona Lisa Without the Smile	Lowly cashier Edward G . Robinson ( as Christopher " Chris " Cross ) receives the nominal company gift of an engraved watch , for 25 years of faithful service . Slightly tipsy , Mr . Robinson leaves to look for the New York City subway . On a Greenwich Village street , he sees beautiful Joan Bennett ( as Katherine " Kitty " March ) being slapped around , and thrown to the ground , by boyfriend Dan Duryea ( as Johnny Prince ) . Robinson rescues Ms . Bennett , and Mr . Duryea flees . Unhappily married , Robinson is enthralled with shapely , sexy Bennett , and succumbs to her request for a drink . Bennett suspects the older , unattractive Robinson is a wealthy artist ; she decides to use his obvious interest to her advantage . Director Fritz Lang's brilliant , daring , and imaginative follow-up to " The Woman in the Window " ; " Scarlet Street " is one of its genre's crowning achievements . Bennett's nasty , spitting " Kitty " is a sleazy , amoral classic ; if the part weren't so unflattering , she could have won a " Best Actress " award . Somewhat less underrated , Robinson masterfully manages his mild-mannered role ; certainly , he deserved " Best Actor " consideration . Always convincing in " tough " roles , Robinson is especially believable as the apron-clad " Chris Cross " . Bennett and Robinson formed a striking screen partnership , under Lang's direction . Their characterizations are beautifully summed up when Bennett , likely a lazy prostitute , orders aspiring painter Robinson to paint her toenails . At home , Robinson is forced to paint his pictures in the bathroom ; he sees beauty in a flower on the sink ; and , you'll see the clear outline of his toilet bowl , in the lower right of your screen . Dudley Nichols ' screenplay ( of the original " La Chienne " ) cleverly plays within , and stretches the limits of , mainstream motion picture standards . Duryea , Margaret Lindsay ( as Millie ) , and shrewish Rosalind Ivan ( as Adele ) are the best supporting players . See " Scarlet Street " once for the story , and twice for the art . Scarlet Street ( 1945 ) Fritz Lang - Edward G . Robinson , Joan Bennett , Dan Duryea , Rosalind Ivan
