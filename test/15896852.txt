Dale Evans ( as Billie ) sails a local tugboat named " Apache Rose " and Olin Howlin is Mr . Rogers ' lovable old codger friend " Alkali " . Bob Nolan and the " Sons of the Pioneers " are around when necessary . Gamblers aboard the boat " Casino Del Mar " aka " S . S . Casino " are the main adversaries , led by nasty George Meeker ( as Reed Calhoun ) . This film is very poorly performed and presented by Rogers and company . Ms . Evans is absurd as a disguised Senorita , and her song " There's Nothing ' Like Coffee in the Morning " looks like a breakfast commercial try-out . Mr . Howlin's quickly disappearing " black eye " might have been better placed on the entire disjointed production . Apache Rose ( 1947 ) William Witney - Roy Rogers , Dale Evans , Olin Howland

He is held at gunpoint ( and later tied up ) by three outlaws : gang leader Warren Kemmerling ( as Jack Hanks ) , Mexican right hand man Fernando Lamas ( as Paco Romero ) , and slightly psycho Jack Weston ( as John Holden ) . The bar's proprietor is saucy Jeanette Nolan ( as Martha Tuforth ) . She and young blonde " niece " Sheilah Wells ( as Maryanne ) are also hostages . Later , city councilman Tol Avery ( as Millburn Willburn ) and his older blonde wife Marian Moses ( as Letty ) become additional hostages . The episode's bizarre storyline involves outlaw Lamas romancing the experienced " old blonde " ( Ms . Moses ) and the pliable " young blonde " ( Ms . Wells ) . The hostage victims are so taken by their abductor's charms , they begin to fight over him - desiring to continue serving him as hostage , in Mexico . Halfway into the story , Joe ( William Smith ) arrives , posing as a traveling salesman ( the " Stanley " character referred to in the episode title ) . Perhaps wisely , Peter Brown and Philip Carey do not appear during the hour . It ends strangely . Moses later appeared on " Falcon Crest " ; both she and Lamas had sons ( Lorenzo and William ) who were regulars on the show .

The time alone makes the gorilla hate all other primates and turns it into a murderous monster . A final confrontation between the white gorilla and his former tribe's leader will decide the fate of all of Africa , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Ray " Crash " Corrigan ( as Steve Collins ) extensively recalls seeing the 1927 serial " Perils of the Jungle " , which had noting to do with " The White Gorilla " in his present form ( as Ray Corrigan ) . To wit , Mr . Corrigan witnesses his " friend " Frank Merrill ( as Ed Bradford ) in the old silent serial . Mr . Merrill , who also played " Tarzan " , must have got a kick out of seeing himself co-starring in a new movie , after almost 20 years of retirement from film . The opening credits promise an " All-Star Cast " , but neither Bing Crosby nor Greer Garson appear in this movie . The 1927 footage is better than the newer parts .

Extra sensory perceptive Cynthia Cline ( as Vivian ) unfortunately gets swept up in his investigation . " UFO Target Earth " plays like a stretched-out " Outer Limits " episode , with one-tenth of the old show's budget . But , in this case , there IS something wrong with your television set .

His wife and daughter visit him , thus destroying his cover , and the head of the ring , a kind older man with a dark secret , kidnaps his daughter , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . " The Island Monster " has a drug-smuggling Boris Karloff ( as Don Gaetano ) and his gang kidnapping the daughter of leading man Renato Vicario ( as Mario Andreani ) . Franca Marzi ( as Gloria D'Auro ) provides ample feminine distraction , which Mr . Vicario has promised his wife he'll avoid , romantically .

Mr . Wayne becomes " John Jones " . Mr . Chandler's is supposed to be " Rev . Smith " , but Wayne calls him " Dr . Smith " . At no time are either of them as entertaining as Roger Davis , Pete Duel , Jonathan Harris , or Ben Murphy ; although , Wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them , career wise . Pretty blonde Mary Kornman ( as Anne ) , grown-up from her days in " Our Gang " , is a lovely interest for Wayne . She and Chandler have a couple of cute scenes with Wayne . If you're not a fan of low budget John Wayne films of the 1930s , this movie won't make you one .

" A man in town for a convention gets lost while trying to return to his hotel room , after seeing a woman , and ends up being taken in by a mortician to wait out a storm . To pass the time , the mortician shows the man four recently deceased people and begins to tell him how each person ended up as an occupant of one of his coffins , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . John Ericson ( as Talmudge ) is the man who finds refuge with mortician Ivor Francis , during the rainstorm . Mr . Francis ' four stories aren't as enthralling as his characterization is appealing . Bernard Fox ( as McDowal ) is featured in the , passable , third story . Mr . Fox was , perhaps , most memorable the delightful witch doctor first called upon by " Samantha Stevens " on " Bewitched " ; but , even " Dr . Bombay " can't save this plodding film . Charles Aidman ( as Toliver ) banters well with Fox . " Alien Zone " was appropriately re-titled " House of the Dead " . Steve March , vocalizing the theme song " The Sound of Goodbye " , sounds a little like his famous father .

Pryor ( as Eddie ) had to have already been contracted and paid for this film to see completion . Otherwise , there are no credible responses to the remarks , " You guys are awful ! " and " This is NOT working ! " The most jaw-dropping unfunny moments involve yodeling . Mercedes Ruehl ( as Elaine aka Mimi ) has an sexy and effective black underwear scene . Pryor has a good sequence , upon arriving at the Fielding mansion . Wilder impersonates Cary Grant and Desi Arnaz . If you don't count Lucy , Ethel , and Elvia Allman working in the candy factory ( on the Fielding's TV ) , the early 1990s Hollywood location footage is the film's only real strength .

However , blackouts , delirium , and rejection threaten to thwart his efforts . He would also like to rekindle romance with an old sweetheart , a significantly flawed prospect , as things turns out . Mr . Redfield also directed this dramatization of the mysterious last days of Edgar Allen Poe . Redfield employs a lot of black and white , color , and trick photography to create mood . Kevin G .

She promises to wait for his successful return , and gives him half of a locket ; and , they pledge their eternal love . While Pickford pines away , Powell gets way-out-west drunk , and takes up with Mexican woman Marion Leonard . Powell's descent is a little difficult to comprehend ; perhaps it is the power of drink . He seemed to have very little use for " The Broken Locket " while in Ms . Leonard's company . Leonard writes one powerful letter , by the way ; the mere reading of one may cause blindness !
452722	15896852	507834	2.0	( He's Got ) The Magic Touch	" This two-part story is about Peter Hurkos , a man trying to escape from the Nazis , who falls from a five-story building and is severely injured . After awakening from a coma , Hurkos discovers that he now has some amazing psychic abilities . Struggling to deal with his newfound abilities , Hurkos falls into drinking heavily while trying a career in show business , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . That's a fairly accurate description of " The Peter Hurkos Story ( Part 1 ) " . Albert Salmi ( as Hurkos ) tries his best - but this " true story " of a man's uncanny psychic powers , resulting from his Nazi-era experience , never rings true . It might have been more convincing if Mr . Hurkos recalled some predispositions toward the psychic , before the fall . Betty Garde , as modern day witch " Tante Elsa " , is the half-hour's highlight . And , you might enjoy John Banner , pre - " Sgt . Schultz " .

453220	15896852	39892	2.0	Ronald Reagan Takes Shirley Temple in a Bizarre Act of Unnatural Love	In a small Ohio town , randy lawyer Ronald Reagan ( as Tom Bates ) is rumored to be the father , in a child-producing scandal . Eighteen years later , the child has grown into perky student Shirley Temple ( as Mary Hagen ) . " That Hagen Girl " doesn't know about her shadowy past , but intuitively feels the taint . When Mr . Reagan returns to town , both he and Temple hear the father / daughter story ( which everyone else in the cast knows ) . Reagan dismisses the story as malicious gossip , while courting Temple's teacher , Lois Maxwell ( as Julia Kane ) . Meanwhile , Temple scores with athletic Rory Calhoun ( as Ken Freneau ) . After Calhoun spontaneously weds Penny Edwards ( as Christine Delaney ) , Temple gets expelled after a wild night out with fun-loving Conrad Janis ( as Dewey Koons ) , who called Temple and Calhoun " The gruesome twosome of 1947 . " Reagan , who was impressed with Temple's performance as " Juliet " in her school play , offers to pay for her University education . Temple takes it as fatherly interest ; but , Ronald Reagan is falling in love with young Shirley Temple ? This is a very strange film . The now not-so-shocking " romance " between the older Reagan and younger Temple is overshadowed by their timelessly unconvincing and unappealing performances - at no time do they EVER seem like they are falling in love . The supporting players , several in early appearances , are a few notches better . Certainly , young Janis realizes the full potential of his ( " Dewey Koons " ) role - something this adept and entertaining actor would do for decades to come .

453332	15896852	57227	2.0	Smokey Mountain Bore	Elvis Presley plays Brunet Lieutenant Josh and his Blond " hillbilly " cousin Jodie . Brunet Elvis has to secure the family of Blond Elvis ' land for an important U . S . Army base . The Elvises wrestle and stuff ; but , they never actually kiss . Yvonne Craig stands out among the busty mountain women ; later , she was one of Batman's TV Catwomen . The fun in " Kissin ' Cousins " is not in the situation ; but in picking out the Elvis " double " in the scenes where they both appear . It's fairly easy to spot the fake Elvis . There are a lot of very well-proportioned women in bikinis running around and squealing ; today , there are more satisfying ways to find that kind of entertainment . I enjoyed the song " Tender Feeling " ; but , it's actually the song " Shenandoah " with different lyrics . " Barefoot Ballad " is the most embarrassing song . The musical highlight is the song " Kissin ' Cousins " ; but , watch for the superior version at the end , not the beginning , of the film . The material in " Kissin ' Cousins " would make one good music video . As a full-length feature film , it's shameful .

453638	15896852	69159	2.0	The Dirty Dozin '	This English re-titled " A Reason to Live , A Reason to Die " is a thoroughly unconvincing United States Civil War swipe of " The Dirty Dozen " , done in the Clint Eastwood " spaghetti western " style . James Coburn ( as Pembroke ) leads a less than star-studded group of seven desperadoes . ( Still pre-Kojak ) Telly Savalas , who appeared as one of the original " Dozen " , is Mr . Coburn's major foil . Mr . Savalas ( as Ward ) has interesting taste in sculpture art . The locations are nice , but don't seem very American . The film's relatively high level of explosions , shootings , and stabbings must have been the box office draw , back in the early 1970s . Today , you only need to play a video game .

Mr . Guizar is also a singing cowboy . As " The Gay Ranchero " of the title , Guizar seems to have more to do than Rogers . Andy Devine ( as " Cookie " ) works at the Manzanita Springs Airline being sabotaged , and helps out singling cowboys out - and , gets helped out during the bull session . Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers add songs and laughs . This film seems to be an attempt to cross-over the audiences of American singing cowboy star Roy Rogers and Mexican singing cowboy star Tito Guizar . Or , it may be an attempt to introduce the Mexican singing cowboy star to Rogers ' U . S . audience . The resulting film is like two partial movies , either of which are very good . The cowboy stars never really operate / act as a " team " ; they have little rapport , and few opportunities to show any .

Mr . Robbins , who runs the gambling and " hop " joint " The Royal Pekin Club " , wants young Ms . Eddy for himself .

Big mistake . Mr . Gleason draws the attention of a passing policeman , and Emerson is left holding the bag .

452973	15896852	120757	3.0	Broken Hip	The DVD sleeve explains the premise : " Three problem teens are headed for jail , " and are " set to do time until Captain Greer offers them a deal to work for him - undercover . " The film opens with definitions of the words " Mod " and " Squad " , so you won't have to look them up in the dictionary . For a visual definition of " Cool " , search for photographs of the original threesome : Michael Cole ( as Pete Cochran ) , Clarence Williams III ( as Linc Hayes ) , and Peggy Lipton ( as Julie Barnes ) . One black . One white . One blonde . Once they defined cool . The three who make up Scott Silver's version of Aaron Spelling's " The Mod Squad " are twentysomethings : Claire Danes ( as Julie Barnes ) , Giovanni Ribisi ( as Pete Cochran ) , and Omar Epps ( as Linc Hayes ) . They aren't able to do much with the material given . Mr . Ribisi's portrayal is the most " far out " , meaning he digresses most from the original characterization . Ms . Danes romances Josh Brolin ( as Billy Waites ) , who looks like he could be in a re-make of " Marcus Welby , MD " . You won't believe hefty Michael Lerner dancing with Mr . Epps ' " Linc " . He explains , " I'm not a fairy , I just like to dance ! " and requests , " Spin me ! " The Mod Squad ( 1999 ) Scott Silver - Claire Danes , Giovanni Ribisi , Omar Epps

The crazed young man decides to carry out his revenge by tracking down and killing all the officials and jurors responsible for his brother's trial and execution , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Boris Petroff's " Anatomy of a Psycho " is a pale period piece , which seemingly sought to ( given the title ) bask in the glow of two significantly more timeless films . It might have been interesting had it tweaked the covertly homosexual relationship between Darrell Howe ( as Chet Marco ) and Frank Kiliman ( as Bobby Brown ) , for starters . By the way , it's easy to mistake Mr . Howe for Ronnie Burns ( as Mickey Craig ) , due to the latter's star billing . Mr . Burns , who plays a slightly more secondary role to Mr . Howe's " bad boy " lead , was the more well-known actor , due to his appearing from 1955-'59 on his parents ' TV series . Relax , Ronnie does not stray too far from his familiar role as the nice young son of George Burns & Gracie Allen .

Stanley Holloway and Mona Washbourne ( as Mr . and Mrs . Brown ) lift the film's acting levels only slightly , unfortunately ; they have a very fetching teen model daughter Judy ( Sarah Caldwell ) , who catches Mr . N-o-o-n-e's eye . The other " Mrs . Brown " is his greyhound dog . By far , the best part of the film is Herman's " There's a Kind of Hush ( All Over the World ) " night dream ; it's a great song , and was a huge international hit for the group in early 1967 . Title song " Mrs . Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter " is also a winner ; however , it is not given a full performance in this film - - and , it's an even older track . Strong new material from the group ( and session players Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones ) might have helped this film . The " My Old Man's A Dustman " scene / song is amusing , but why wasn't a Hermits-sung performance if this song used ? That might have provided the group with a film supporting novelty hit ; at least in the USA , which the Hermits seemed more able to do than Most . . . it is spelled N-o-o-n-e , but the correct spelling doesn't work

Foreign agents learn of their work and sabotage the plane , hoping to stop the inventors and allowing the spies to steal the invention . Our inventors hope to thwart the plans of the spies and deliver the robot plane to the army , thus saving the country , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . After making an impression in 1940's popular " The Westerner " , young Forrest Tucker ( as Jerry Barton ) is piloted into a starring programmer role . " Emergency Landing " ( inappropriately re-titled " Robot Pilot " ) is an unimpressive vehicle for Mr . Tucker , who would find later success in television's " F Troop " . Listen for an amusing exchange between leading lady Carol Hughes ( as Betty Lambert ) and aunt Evelyn Brent ( as Maude Marshall ) : on their way to tinsel town , Ms . Brent wonders what she will do in Hollywood . Ms . Hughes replies , " Barrymore is single again . " Brent appeared with John Barrymore in " Raffles " ( 1917 ) and " Night Club Scandal " ( 1937 ) ; indeed , he had just received his fourth divorce .

The two reporters start out as rivals but combine efforts to solve the crime and write the story when more residents of the apartment building turn up dead , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . This said-to-be follow-up to " The Thirteenth Guest " has little to do with the earlier movie ; it is not a sequel , as has been inferred . Ms . Rogers continues to develop her skills . Mr . Talbot adds a little humor to his characterization . They are a pleasant team , the plot is interesting and mysterious ; but , the resulting film is very dull . The opening and closing are startling . A long-winded wrap-up of plot development points follows the climax . A Shriek in the Night ( 1933 ) Albert Ray - Ginger Rogers , Lyle Talbot , Harvey Clark

Notable as a very early effort from writer / director Francis Ford Coppola , who went on to much greater success in the 1970s . Producer Roger Corman should be commended as he , once again , provides work for an up-and-coming Hollywood player . Mr . Coppola , unlike some other Corman travelers , doesn't really rise to the occasion , for his " Dementia 13 " . What worked for Alfred Hitchcock ( director of " Psycho " ) does not work for everybody , obviously . On the other hand , under-appreciated actress Luana Anders ( as Louise Haloran ) is worth checking out , both in and out of her clothing .

Rogers's ex-pal , Sheriff Gabby . Gale Storm ( Jane Fillmore ) and Sally Payne ( Polly Morgan ) are a noteworthy team , as two reporters on the lookout for stories about the elusive outlaw hero . Of course , mistaken identity / impersonation is a plot development , since Rogers essays a " dual role " . Rogers is charming , as usual ; but , there is nothing really elevating this his performance above the ordinary - any potential to deliver a memorable Jekyll / Hyde performance is done in by poor material . The better pair to watch are Ms . Storm and Ms . Paye as the St . Louis Journal reporters - they are the film's highlight . The songs are fine , though badly synched .

Akins on a dangerous mission transporting a box of legal documents to nearby Uvalde . This is the first of several episodes featuring semi-regular Claude Akins . Like George Kennedy in a previous episode , his character seems like a " replacement " for Neville Brand . Mr . Akins does quite well in his part-time Ranger role . Mr . Brand , who does appear , seems unwell , probably due to alcohol consumption . Ironically , this is most apparent when the prohibitionist Judge tells the " Laredo " group he doesn't feel Brand is competent enough to go on the episode's mission ; and , " Reese " is left to mind the office .

453586	15896852	29804	3.0	Don't Even Try	Playboy lawyer Preston Foster ( as Jimmy Hughes ) is reluctantly recruited to run against an incumbent mayor , while romancing his daughter , pretty blonde Joan Fontaine ( as Trudy Olson ) . The campaign leads to the uncovering of a gang of racketeering gamblers in the city , with both mayoral candidates , and the city police chief , becoming suspects . " You Can't Beat Love " is a competent , but routine little piece of fluff , which looks to have benefited few of those involved . There are a few likable moments . Thankfully , it was as forgettable as it was routine . You Can't Beat Love ( 1937 ) Christy Cabanne - Preston Foster , Joan Fontaine , Herbert Mundin
452868	15896852	624863	3.0	The Kid Stays in the Picture	Reese ( Neville Brand ) , Chad ( Peter Brown ) , and Joe ( William Smith ) are to bring in wounded bank robber Jack Kelly ( as Lance Mabry ) , but find it difficult after meeting his perky pigtailed daughter , Gina Gillespie ( as Kim " Missy " Mabry ) . This is the obligatory " outlaw with a cute kid " episode ( and , it was Easter time , after all ) . Unfortunately , it is a noticeably sloppy production . Kids do help with characterization , and the Rangers react accordingly . The script experiments with an out of the blue " point-of-view " flashback , with Capt . Parmalee ( Philip Carey ) speculating about how events unfolded . At least , each member of the " Laredo " cast is utilized .

452508	15896852	75200	3.0	You Can't Teach an Old Dog New Tricks ?	When his house is repeatedly robbed , Dean Jones ( as Wilby ) receives no assistance from the local authorities ; so , he decides to run for District Attorney . Complicating his run is the reemergence of a magical ring from his teenage years - which turns him into an on again / off again shaggy dog . This movie is the first sequel to Walt Disney's " The Shaggy Dog " ( 1959 ) . Wilby Daniels , the teenager from the first film ( Tommy Kirk ) , has grown up , and has a family of his own : Suzanne Pleshette ( as wife Betty ) and Shane Sinutko ( as son Brian ) . None of the original film's leading actors appear in either flashback or cameo . " The Shaggy D . A . " attempts to explain more about the reasons for the change , raising more questions than it answers . This movie has a few funny moments , helped immensely by Tim Conway - there are a lot of other 1970s TV performers to pick out , which can be fun . But the film is a dog , compared to the original . The " special effects " from the first Shaggy progress surprisingly little , and look worse in color . The charming interacting performances of Mr . Kirk and the original's young characters is gone . The Shaggy D . A . ( 1976 ) Robert Stevenson - Dean Jones , Tim Conway , Suzanne Pleshette
453578	15896852	1439	3.0	Loan Shark !	Early social commentary directed by D . W . Griffith ; it's about " The Usurer " ( think " Loan Shark " and " Money Lender " ) who calls in some loans , resulting in misery for those not as well off as he . As he collects money , he indulges more and more . Like Mr . Griffith's previous " message film " he receives an ironic comeuppance . An unremarkable Griffith short ; technically , it's not up to the director's own standards . The sealed room looks like it might fall down any moment . Both the actors and sets move in the wrong ways ; and , it's painful to see poor Mary Pickford and Henry B . Walthall have their furniture repossessed ! The Usurer ( 1910 ) D . W . Griffith - George Nichols , Grace Henderson , Mack Sennett
452845	15896852	286106	4.0	What in God's Name Is Going On Here ?	Man-of-the-cloth Mel Gibson ( as Graham Hess ) has left the Priesthood . Six months ago , Mr . Gibson lost his wife in a car accident ; and , he is struggling with a loss of Christian faith . Gibson's younger brother , Joaquin Phoenix ( as Merrill Hess ) has moved in , to help Gibson and his children grieve . Mr . Phoenix was a promising baseball player , but he stuck out too much . Gibson is an Episcopalian , obviously ( a wife and sex are permitted ) , with two children : asthmatic alien-conscious Rory Culkin ( as Morgan Hess ) and perpetually thirsty Abigail Breslin ( as Bo Hess ) . Gibson is also a farmer . The movie gets started when extraterrestrials startle Gibson's family , by turning their Pennsylvania cornfield into " Crop Signs " - aka " Crop Circles " . Soon , these " Signs " are popping up all over India , and the world . Presumably , the designs are signposts for motherships - it's difficult to understand what logical purpose they would serve , as an alien spacecraft would be too technically advanced to use them . . . maybe , then , they are merely alien pranks . Or , they could be sent from God , to help Gibson re-harvest his faith ? " Signs " borrows its basic plot from H . G . Wells ' " The War of the Worlds " - a frequently tapped well . Gibson , Phoenix , and the kids look very silly in two memorable poses , sitting stone-faced with their palms on their knees and / or wearing pointy tinfoil hats . The biggest " jolt " comes early in the film , with a simple dog's bark . Mr . Shyamalan builds suspense well , in the early scenes . The best performance is delivered by director M . Night Shyamalan ( as Ray Reddy ) . Cherry Jones ( as Caroline Paski ) is okay as the local cop , but her character should have written up ( as a possessed alien , for example ) . The main " special effect " is good ; but , the aliens , if they are real , have to be the dumbest extraterrestrials in the galaxy , if you stop and think about it ? Signs ( 2002 ) M . Night Shyamalan - Mel Gibson , Joaquin Phoenix , Rory Culkin
453636	15896852	91170	4.0	Tennessee Walls	Fifteen-year-old Gary McCleery ( as Bobby Lipscomb ) skips school , hangs around with his older brothers , and dreams of flying airplanes . One evening , he makes the " Hard Choice " and joins drug-addicted Martin Donovan ( as Josh Lipscomb ) and trigger happy John Snyder ( as Ben Lipscomb ) in a " Food Market " robbery . Unfortunately , Mr . Snyder kills a police officer , who happens upon the scene . The three brothers are quickly apprehended . Mr . McCleery hopes to be tried as a juvenile ; but , Tennessee judges rule he is to be tried as an adult . When things look bleakest for young McCleery , social worker Margaret Klenck ( as Laura Stephens ) steps in to improve his treatment in prison and the courts ; she is only partially successful . Then , Ms . Klenck makes a " Hard Choice " of her own ? According to the sleeve , this film got excellent reviews ; and , the quotes are from reliable sources . Perhaps some of these reviewers will consider re-evaluation " Hard Choices " ? It really isn't all that believable a story . McCleery doesn't seem much like a 15-year-old , and Klenck's character development is disappointing ( to say the least ) . However , they , and the other performers , do as well as they can ( with the story ) . It's great to see Mr . Donovan in an early role ; strangely , he and Snyder are abandoned during the running time . Writer-director John Sayles is good , also , as Klenck's coke companion . The photography , by Tom Hurwitz , is a major strength . Hard Choices ( 1985 ) Rick King - Gary McCleery , Margaret Klenck , John Sayles
453315	15896852	23996	4.0	That Sinking Feeling	The acronymic " F . P . 1 " stands for " Floating Platform # 1 " . The film portends the building of an " F . P . 1 " in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean , to be used as an " air station " for transatlantic plane flights . Based a contemporary Curt Siodmark novel ; it was filmed in German as " F . P . 1 antwortet nicht " ( 1932 ) , in French as " I . F . 1 ne répond plus " ( 1933 ) , and in English as " F . P . 1 " ( 1933 ) . Soon , technology made non-stop oceanic travel much more preferable . Stars Conrad Veidt ( as Ellissen ) , Jill Esmond ( as Droste ) , and Leslie Fenton ( as Claire ) find love and sabotage on and off the Atlantic platform . Karl Hartl directed . Mr . Veidt is most fun to watch ; but , he is not convincing in the " love triangle " with Ms . Esmond and Mr . Fenton . The younger co-stars were the spouses of Laurence Olivier and Ann Dvorak , respectively . Both the concept and film have not aged well .
453498	15896852	37084	4.0	Gorilla in the Midst	" A scientist has developed a serum which grotesquely distorts the victim's hands and heads . The scientist decides to use his serum on a concert pianist to extort money from him for the cure as well as take the man's daughter for a wife , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . J . Carrol Naish ( as Dr . Igor Markoff ) plays " The Monster Maker " in the low budget Bela Lugosi mode . Mr . Naish's serum causes a real disorder , " acromegaly " , which American Heritage defines as , " A chronic disease of adults marked by enlargement of the bones of the extremities , face , and jaw that is caused by overactivity of the pituitary gland . " Ralph Morgan ( as Anthony Lawrence ) plays the afflicted man with some dignity . Pretty blonde Wanda McKay ( as Patricia " Pat " Lawrence ) is the daughter desired by mad scientist Naish ; in early scenes , Ms . McKay and Naish emote hilariously . Watch for Tala Birell ( as Maxine ) in a surprisingly good supporting performance ; she plays the somewhat Garbo-like , and long suffering , assistant to Naish . Ms . Birell definitely steals the film ; and , you've got to question Dr . Markoff's sanity in casting her aside . Glenn Strange ( as Steve ) and a crazed gorilla ( Ray Corrigan ) add to the fun . The monster makeup ( Maurice Seiderman ) is very good . The Monster Maker ( 1944 ) Sam Newfield - J . Carrol Naish , Ralph Morgan , Tala Birell
453544	15896852	258534	4.0	Another Picture of Dorian Gray	The story is familiar - recall , original novelist Oscar Wilde's " Dorian " wished his painting would grow old whilst he remain young . Like in days of old , handsome male model Ethan Erickson ( as Louis ) wishes for eternal youth . Then , while one of his pictures ages , he becomes the ageless " Dorian " of the title . Like his predecessors , Mr . Erickson descends into decadent debauchery . A charismatic older mentor , Malcolm McDowell ( as Henry ) , eggs him on . . . Re-titled " Pact with the Devil " . Allan A . Goldstein's updated " Dorian " alters the story in ways that become nonsensical . The main problem occurs by making Mr . McDowell's character semi-Faustian . To have McDowell in the cast , and render his character inexplicable , should be a crime . Erickson , an extremely good-looking man , is also slighted by a faltering characterization - in an early scene , he is required to pretend he couldn't imagine someone thinking he could be a pin-up boy ? And , Jennifer Nitsch ( as Bae ) has an undeveloped , but intriguing , back-story . Dorian ( 2001 ) Allan A . Goldstein - Ethan Erickson , Malcolm McDowell , Jennifer Nitsch
452909	15896852	43482	4.0	The Civil War is Predictable	During the US Civil War , Confederate Major James Craig ( as Clay Clayburn ) finds himself fighting Union Major Guy Madison ( as Will Denning ) . As is the case in most Civil War stories , the opposing soldiers once had a close relationship ; in this case , they were West Point buddies . Mr . Craig is also in love with a beautiful woman , Barbara Payton ( as Kathy Summers ) . This is a fairly predictable Civil War story . The dramatics are enhanced by Ms . Payton in the feminine lead . Payton is the most interesting player in the middling " Drums in the Deep South " ; with a better part , and direction , Payton might have been a much bigger star . Her biography is sad , and typical .

But soon the horrible truth about their ' vacation ' surfaces . Betty's husband doesn't intend to bring his family back to America . . . ever . She may return , he says , but their daughter must stay . In a hostile , war-torn country , where even the slightest misstep can mean death , she makes a desperate bid to escape with her child , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . This Iranian husband , who reads newspapers at work printed in his own language , doesn't know how much his country has changed ? What on EARTH did Ms . Field's character see in this psychopath ? Did they cut the scene where someone deposits a giant pea-pod in his Iranian backyard ? The relationship between the two principles is totally unbelievable , with Mr . Molina faring the worse . One wonders what " American " citizens thought of Iranian immigrants after watching this film in 1991 . But , it plays ( as a monster " moody " ) .

452657	15896852	18440	4.0	Comedy Off Course	William Haines ( as Jack Kelly ) is a shipping clerk , and an avid golfer ; he is much more interested in the hobby than the livelihood . Mr . Haines ' golfing prowess earns him a two week membership in the ritzy " Oakmont Country Club " , where he meets fetching young Joan Crawford ( as Allie Monte ) . Of course , Ms . Crawford assumes the dashing Haines is a well-heeled member of the " golf set " . Will she still love him if she finds out he is poor ? Haines ' wardrobe is remarkably ill fitting in the opening scenes ; and , as a result , he rather badly tears the right sleeve of his jacket . It's quite noticeable after he enters the workplace , following the initial golfing scene . Also , watch for Haines to tap another man's derrière , very quickly , as he passes the man , after entering the shipping company . Haines and Crawford are a great screen team ; especially , their rapport is evident when he shows her how to improve her golf game - which develops into a courtship . But , overall , " Spring Fever " is fairly routine . There are a few witty title cards , and scenes . George K . Arthur ( as Eustace Tewksbury ) stands out among the fine supporting cast . Considering the situation and cast , the film is a letdown . It might have been improved by more directly involving Haines and Mr . Arthur in some more comic interplay ( on the golf course ) .

Meanwhile , Jeff is broke , and asks sister Mary to lend him some money ( incidentally , Mary loses five cents on the dollar ; and , Jeff needs to watch out for tables ) .

453674	15896852	74829	4.0	Strangers in the Night	" A young woman suffers from the delusion that she is a werewolf , based upon a family legend of an ancestor accused of and killed for allegedly being one . Due to her past treatment by men , she travels the countryside seducing and killing the men she meets . Falling in love with a kind man , her life appears to take a turn for the better when she is raped and her lover is killed by a band of thugs . Traumatized again by these latest events , the woman returns to her violent ways and seeks revenge on the thugs , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Rino Di Silvestro's " La lupa mannara " begins with full frontal , writhing , moaning dance by shapely blonde Annik Borel , who ( as Daniella Neseri ) mistakenly believes she is a werewolf . The hottest part is when the camera catches background fire between her legs . The opening " flashback " reveals her hairy ancestor was ( probably ) a lycanthropic creature . Ms . Borel is , unfortunately , not a werewolf ; she is merely a very strong lunatic . As a film , " Werewolf Woman " ( in English ) would have been better if Borel's character really was a female werewolf ; with her sexual victimization a great bit of characterization . But , as far as 1970s skin and blood flicks go , this one is hard to beat . Bouncy Borel is either nude or sexily clad throughout the film , which features a fair amount of gratuitous gore . Dazzling Dagmar Lassander ( as Elena ) and hunky Howard Ross ( as Luca ) are good supporting players .

Hutton discovers Hart's secret stash , whilst cleaning up his untidy cabin ; so , she calls off the wedding . Next , Hutton succumbs to the charms of mining swindler Frank Borzage ( as W . Sloane Carey ) . Serviceable entertainment from superstar Hart ; he was ranked no less than # 1 at the box office , by Quigley Publications , for the years 1915 and 1916 ( ahead of Mary Pickford ) .

The three young men ride bikes , go swimming , and think about having sex . After his widowed father goes off on a pleasure trip with a sexy secretary , Mr . Stern is sent to live with his grandparents , in Buffalo . Meanwhile , Mr . Kelman and Mr . Roberts are sent to summer camp . Stern is lonely , and writes to his friends about traveling across the border to Canada ( at Niagara Falls ) , where claims to be a regular customer at a whorehouse he calls " Rosie's " . Naturally , Kelman and Roberts want a piece of the action , and surprise Stern with a visit . The lads are eager to sample the prostitutes Stern has bragged about - but , of course , the brothel doesn't exist . After seeing the more asexual Canadian sights , the three pick-up beautiful Jacqueline Bisset ( as Anna ) , and take her to their hotel room ? Just ridiculous . Stern , the leading man , is supposed to be playing a young teenager ( he will be returning to high school in the fall ) . He is obviously too old , but has a goofy quality that helps make the movie's " coming-of-age " theme bearable . Stern's plaintive questions to Ms . Bisset about why girls don't like him is nicely played . Bisset has about one and a half sexy scenes ( you'll see a lot more of Niagara Falls ) . So , why would Bisset's English accent be a problem at the Canadian border ? The First Time ( / 69 ) James Neilson - Wes Stern , Jacqueline Bisset , Ricky Kelman
452746	15896852	25531	4.0	Cheap Freak Show	Enterprising " Times Herald " reporter John Harron ( as Jerry Ross ) investigates " The Murder in the Museum " of a city councilman . This " Museum " isn't what you may be expecting ; although there appear to be a few paintings on display , it's really a traveling freak show - " The World's Largest Collection of Natural and Unnatural Wonders " . Among the attractions : an armless man , a bodiless woman , and the mysterious Henry B . Walthall ( as " Professor Mysto " aka Bernard Latham Wayne ) . Patrons seem more interested in scantily-clad dancing women ; unfortunately , they are told to keep it " tame it down plenty " when " the law " is spotted . The " Sphere Museum " is also a front for drug-runners ( which has attracted police and politicians ) . Just before the murder , Mr . Harron meets shapely blonde Phyllis Barrington ( as Lois Brandon ) ; and , the two fall in love . Mr . Walthall is appropriately mystic ; his casting , alongside the brother of frequent co-star Robert Harron , is inspired . Unfortunately , this production is very poor . The cast and crew manage to get through the picture smoothly enough , considering the obvious lack of rehearsals and re-takes .

453680	15896852	16672	4.0	George K . Arthur plays The Boob	Country boy George K . Arthur ( as Peter Good ) is in love with Gertrude Olmstead ( as Amy ) , but she has taken up smooching with city-slicker Tony D'Algy ( as Harry Benson ) . Mr . Arthur dons western Tom Mix-type clothing to appear more manly , but Ms . Olmstead is unimpressed . Arthur suspicions that Mr . D'Algy is really a criminal bootlegger are proved to be correct ; and , Arthur must rescue Olmstead from D'Algy's clutches ? Though he is a likable character , this is a dated-to-the-point-of-unfunny comedy feature for Arthur . Most unfunny is Charles Murray ( as Cactus Jim ) ' s running gag about hiding his endless supply of booze - - helped , no doubt , by bootleggers . Joan Crawford ( as Jane ) lifts spirits considerably , with her turn as a crack revenue agent ; and , D'Algy is a good kisser . " The Boob " is more of a curiosity than a comedy ; and , it's a chance to see some silent performers in well-preserved celluloid .
453026	15896852	15145	5.0	Taking a Powder	Rudolph Valentino ( as Philippe , aka the " Duke de Chartres " ) is a member of France's 18th century powder set ; he and royal cousin Bebe Daniels ( as Princess Henriette ) are quite a pair , but etiquette gets in the way . So , Mr . Valentino leaves the court of Lowell Sherman ( as King Louis XV ) and Lois Wilson ( as Queen Marie ) ; and , he relocates to Bath , England . There , he assumes the identity of ordinary barber " Monsieur Beaucaire " . Valentino enjoys life as a commoner ; nonetheless , he quickly assumes the role of a French nobleman , in order to romance Doris Kenyon ( as Lady Mary ) . Eventually , he realizes there's no place like home ? After a two year strike , Rudolph Valentino made " Monsieur Beaucaire " his comeback film . It's an elaborate , confusing , and mannered production . Nevertheless , in Valentino's case , absence did make the hearts of America grow fonder ; and , Valentino spent the next two years as the USA's top male Box Office Star . Probably , the position was enhanced due to the continued circulation of the star's previous hits . " Monsieur Beaucaire " is a valiant failure . Staid , light and shadow direction by Sidney Olcott , daintily made-up and costumed players , and elaborately designed scenes are featured . The story of a royal assuming the commoner's role is interesting ; but , despite the title , Valentino is only briefly seen in the entertaining role of barber . Possibly , the film's focus was lost during the making . One of Valentino's 1923 song recordings was added to the soundtrack ; listen for it when the star sings a serenade , near the film's beginning . A record wasn't released until later , but the song is chronologically correct , herein ; thematically , the Valentino recordings more closely fit other films , however . This recording , and Valentino's successful American tour , suggested a Garbo-like success in talking films was possible , had Valentino lived into the sound era .

452592	15896852	9086	5.0	Joseph M . Schenck presents Norma Talmadge in a Beautiful Production	East meets west when Chinese made-up Norma Talmadge ( as San San ) falls in love with visiting United States consulate Thomas Meighan ( as John Worden ) . Mr . Meighan is the answer to her prayer , " Oh , Buddha , please send love-man here to give me million sweet kisses . " Their " forbidden " union produces an interracially grown-up Ms . Talmadge ( as Toy ) , who falls in love with another American , Reed Hamilton ( as Philip Halbert ) . But , Talmadge's dark past threatens their relationship , as Mr . Hamilton's surprisingly prejudiced guardian refuses to bless the union . Despite featuring two of the biggest stars of the silent era , Talmadge and Meighan , and a very capable director , Sidney Franklin , " The Forbidden City " fails to make too much of an impression . The locales and sets are nice , especially during the early scenes . The moon is an appropriate eternal image . Talmadge's prayer to Buddha , and declaration " I American - I no need ancestors ! " make the film more amusing than dramatic . The Forbidden City ( / 18 ) Sidney Franklin - Norma Talmadge , Thomas Meighan , Reed Hamilton
452417	15896852	4113	5.0	Be It Ever So Humble	D . W . Griffith's allegorical study of John Howard Payne , who composed the heart-tugging standard " Home , Sweet Home " . The director presents the drama in four parts : In " Part I . ( Prologue ) " , Henry B . Walthall ( as Payne ) leaves home to make his fortune in the big city , leaving Lillian Gish to pine away at home , with his mother . Mr . Walthall succumbs to a decadent lifestyle ( he becomes an actor ! ) ; and , he never returns home to find true happiness with Ms . Gish . Unfortunately , there is no East Hampton location footage featuring " Payne House " ; which would have been lovely to see , as I am a resident . Walthall and Gish are typically up for the task , in this pivotal episode . Josephine Crowell and Fay Tincher offer support ( from opposite sides of the fence ) . In " Part II . ( First Episode ) " , Robert Harron ( as Robert " Bob " Winthrop ) has better luck as " a fortune seeking youth from the east " who falls for country girl Mae Marsh ( as " Apple Pie " Mary ) . Though tempted to return to his Eastern lifestyle , Harron finally comes to his senses , after hearing " Home , Sweet Home " . This is the best " Episode " of the film , with Harron and Ms . Marsh proving a very pleasant pair . Marsh is especially memorable ; with a cute , lighter characterization than her illustrious co-actresses . Spottiswoode Aiken and Walter Long ( as Alkali Pete ) lend their support . In " Part III . ( Second Episode ) " , Jack Pickford gives mother Mary Alden a will to live after hateful brothers Donald Crisp and James Kirkwood shoot each other to death . Structurally and thematically , this is the weakest link in the overall story . Unlike the other episodes , there is a good deal of outdoor location footage ; highlighted by seacoast scenes , and Pickford's " The brothers are fighting , the brothers are fighting ! " warning ride . Fred Burns lends support , as the sheriff Pickford idolizes . This may have been intended as an individual film , praising good dullness over wicked excitement . In " Part IV . ( Third Episode ) : ' The Marriage of Roses and Lilies ' " , Blanche Sweet is tempted to carnally engage suave Owen Moore , but returns to the arms of sleepy Courtenay Foote , after hearing " Home , Sweet Home . " Here , the drama returns more solidly to the power of the song to change one's direction , in the face of temptation . Happily reversing the earlier episodes , the woman is the character tempted ; although , Ms . Sweet's looks more like innocent flirtation . Edward Dillon lends stalwart support . In " Epilogue " , Walthall is in Hell , or being pulled there by his lustful life . Gish , now an angel in Heaven , flies around , searching for her earthly beloved . Finally , in Gish's loving arms , Walthall ascends . Overall , " Home , Sweet Home " suggests Payne received salvation , in the afterlife , through the everlasting power of his song . Griffith's patchwork storytelling would significantly improve , in a couple of years ? Home , Sweet Home ( / 14 ) D . W . Griffith - Henry B . Walthall , Lillian Gish , Mae Marsh
453474	15896852	271259	5.0	Five Guys , One Safe , No Brains	Despite its intriguing title , this film has nothing whatsoever to do with " Dark Shadows " ; Collinwood is an area in Cleveland , Ohio . Mainly , the film involves " down-and-out working stiffs " Sam Rockwell ( as Pero ) , Michael Jeter ( as Toto ) , Isaiah Washington ( as Leon ) , William H . Macy ( as Riley ) , and Andy Davoli ( as Basil ) . They plan " the BIG heist " - but things go comically wrong . Of the other players , George Clooney ( as Jerzy ) stands out - or , would that be sits out ? - as an expert the gang of five hires , for $500 , to learn safe-cracking . It's quite nice that Mr . Jeter's performance is a highlight , since this is one of his last . If only this comedy " re-make " of the Italian " I soliti ignoti " were funnier ?

An unfortunate childhood ends with Ms . Young being sent to a reform school ; upon release , she falls in with a bad crowd , led by handsome Ricardo Cortez ( as Leo Darcy ) . In an attempt to go legit , moll Young meets suave lawyer Franchot Tone ( as Tom Mannering Jr . ) ; and , they fall in love . Then , predictably , Young's past catches up with her ? Young and chum Una Merkel ( as Bunny ) are remarkably good playing themselves as young girls , in the opening ; and , Mr . Cortez plays his final scene very well , as directed by William A . Wellman . An interesting , but irrelevant , newspaper headline reads , " Hitler Said to Be Gaining in Popularity " , after Andy Devine ( as Sam Travers ) ' s voice cracks . Midnight fun .
453593	15896852	19993	5.0	Mike Fright	MGM's " Hollywood Revue " often comes off like an elaborate amateur " Talent Show " from an otherwise uninvolved in show business group of people . It could be any school , or workplace . Everyone gets a role , and a few people stand out . The early appearance by Joan Crawford sets the tone . She is clearly not at her best , performing a song and dance ; but , she is enthusiastic . So , the company's workforce goes through their assigned tasks , for better or worse . As a variety show , the movie is sometimes good ; but , the brighter spots can't justify its length . It's also a chance to see some big name " stars " in a disappointing light . Without a doubt , the three MGM stars shining brightest are the non-appearing Greta Garbo , Lon Chaney , and Ramon Novarro . Mr . Navarro would have appeared ; but , he was abroad , with his family . Of those appearing , Conrad Nagel and Jack Benny ( his debut ) do well hosting . Mr . Nagel is especially good , singing " You Were Meant for Me " ( to Anita Page ) well enough to have pursued a singing career . Nagel and Bessie Love were already " sound " investments for MGM .

453136	15896852	39678	5.0	Spanish Trail Mix-Up	With " The Great Southwestern Tent Show " in town , cowboy king Roy Rogers ( as Roy Rogers ) learns a featured attraction , his singing " Sons of the Pioneers " pals , have a $10 , 000 I . O . U . debt due . From sleepwalking constable Andy Devine ( as Cookie Bullfincher ) , Mr . Rogers learns about a convenient $10 , 000 reward for the capture of a bandit known as " The Gypsy " . Rogers wants to capture the Spanish outlaw , and pay off his friends ' debt . But , Rogers ' target , Tito Guízar ( as Rico ) , may not be the guiltiest gun in the west ? This colorful " cross-over " western for singing cowboys Rogers and Mr . Guízar is better than " The Gay Ranchero " ( 1948 ) , a similar vehicle . Pretty Dale Evans stand-in Jane Frazee ( as Candy Martin ) arouses romantic feelings in both men ; she has an amusing introductory scene , with Rogers collecting her undergarments from a fallen suitcase - watch as he holds her slip in his teeth ! Estelita Rodriguez ( as Lola ) is memorable . The songs are smooth and forgettable , except for Ms . Rodriguez ' lively " Guadalajara " . The ending is well staged .

452364	15896852	25617	5.0	Watch for Garbo	This film begins with a failed set-up : specifically , Ms . Garbo's younger sister marries , and it is implied that Garbo is becoming an " old maid " . Suddenly , Mr . Marshall's doctor character reveals he has been in love with Garbo since they were 12-year-old schoolchildren . At last , Garbo has a suitor ! At last , Dr . Marshall finds a woman ! Then , the entire supporting cast is wiped away as the quickly wedded couple moves to China . In China , Garbo wears funny hats and attracts the attention of Mr . Brent . Now , the film is a " love triangle " . Next , cholera erupts , giving the doctor's life much purpose ( a " War on Cholera " ) . About an hour into the film , Garbo begins to give flashes of a fascinating acting performance - peaking in the scene where she makes coffee for estranged husband Marshall . Her skills are wasted , however , in this poorly executed film . The Painted Veil ( / 34 ) Richard Boleslawski - Greta Garbo , Herbert Marshall , George Brent
453234	15896852	33367	5.0	Medicine Show People	Roy Rogers , George " Gabby " Hayes , and Sally Payne are members of " Professor Blackstone's Medicine Show " . Their offering of tuneful entertainment and elixir receives a poor reception in the town of Deadwood , led by Bad Man Hal Taliaferro ( as Ripper ) . They decide to stick around and extinguish the " Bad Man of Deadwood " and his wicked gang . The Rogers / Hayes / Payne trio ( plus cute pet ) are a treat as " Medicine " show people . This is an above average , concise Rogers western . Carol Adams ( as reporter Linda Barrett ) is a good romantic interest for Mr . Rogers ; though , they don't flirt enough . It's great to see silent star Monte Blue and weasely Jay Novello among the fine supporting players . It's all lower cost level movie stuff , but ever so pleasant .

Ms . Pickford is best during the well-photographed Karl Struss storm , and post-storm , scenes ; and , Mr . Fairbanks give the best overall performance in the picture . Pickford improves much upon her previous " Coquette " ; and , Fairbanks proves himself a fine " talking " film actor . While relatively well-received , at the time of release , this " Shrew " fell considerably shy of being highly regarded . Still , for what it is , it's more enjoyable than embarrassing . Certainly , it should appeal to admirers of Pickford and Fairbanks . The Taming of the Shrew ( / 29 ) Sam Taylor - Mary Pickford , Douglas Fairbanks , Edwin Maxwell
453016	15896852	45016	5.0	Overly Sentimental , but Captivating Drama	Loretta Young stars as the wife of University professor Kent Smith . Life seems wonderful ; however Ms . Young is told , after a second miscarriage , she can never have children . Later , she is speeding home , after some event , and hits a child with her car . A truck driver ( also on the road ) takes the boy , and leaves the desperate woman wondering what injuries she's caused . " Paula " begins as a seemingly routine Loretta Young drama , but keep your eye on the picture for a grabber . The story becomes very interesting as circumstances make Young a dramatic hit-and-run driver . The story builds suspense in several ways - - beginning as Young searches for the boy she hit , while the police search for Young . Although it's a great story , the script becomes more and more sentimental - - by the end , it's so maudlin you'll want to scream ( if you're not crying ) . Tommy Rettig is notable as the boy ; in fact , he is Young's co-star . Mr . Rettig also played one of Lassie's famous owners ( Jeff ) . Young and Rettig do well , but they would be even better after a realistic script re-write . The film has some unexpected depth , and raises some interesting crime / punishment questions ; perhaps , its flaws could be addressed in a modern re-make . Paula ( 1952 ) Rudolph Maté - Loretta Young , Tommy Rettig , Kent Smith
453649	15896852	75213	5.0	John Wayne's Last Shot	Notorious western gunslinger John Wayne ( as J . B . Brooks ) is dying of cancer . He receives some painkilling medicine from friendly old doctor James Stewart ( as E . W . Hostetler ) . Then , Mr . Wayne rents a room from Lauren Bacall ( as Bond Rogers ) ; there , he hopes to die ( God willing ) as peacefully as possible . Ms . Bacall has a son , Ron Howard ( as Gillom Rogers ) , who has a hankerin ' for notorious western gunslingers ? The film opens nicely , with a slightly older " Opie Taylor " narrating over scenes from superior westerns from Wayne's past . These tie Wayne's " Shootist " character in with the old Wayne persona ; at least , it's a blended memory of the older western roles Wayne played - - from Red River ( 1948 ) to El Dorado ( 1966 ) . The character Wayne plays does not compare favorably with the older roles , however . The director , cast , and storyline make " The Shootist " a sentimental undertaking , as it is Wayne's last film ; eventually , he would die from cancer ( unlike the character in this film , incidentally ) . Actor Wayne and director Don Siegel have some good moments , and Bacall does very well . The sets and locale are lovely . Mr . Howard is a little tough to take as a ( presumably ) teenager idolizing Wayne . The ending , with Wayne and Howard in some cathartic moment , does not work . It's weird to see Wayne stick a gun in " Morning Appeal " reporter Richard Lenz ' mouth , and order him to suck . Soon after , he kicks him . Even weirder is the scene where Wayne goes to get a shave and haircut in the local Barber Shop . You never see the barber cut into his hair . In fact , Wayne looks no more " trimmed " than when he went in - - but the barber sweeps up a bunch of silver hair anyway , after finding a piece on Wayne's vest .

Naturally , as a famed symbologist , Mr . Hanks is called upon , to help investigate the murder . Assisting Hanks is pretty police cryptologist Audrey Tautou ( as Sophie Neveu ) . Ms . Tautou immediately hooks up with Hanks ; and , the two quickly turn from investigators to investigated . Meanwhile , fanatical self-flogging murderer Paul Bettany ( as Silas ) eludes capture ? Writer Dan Brown's storyline is a grand one ; and , director Ron Howard's film adaptation of " The DaVinci Code " is definitely well-produced . Still , it's neither as successful nor startling as the book . If you've managed to stay unfamiliar with the main plot revelations , they should be apparent by the time Ian McKellen ( as Leigh Teabing ) pontificates . Mr . McKellen and Mr . Bettany effectively play their showy supporting roles . Hans Zimmer contributes a marvelous soundtrack . Until something better comes along , this version of the story is intriguing , at least .

453070	15896852	34928	6.0	There Were Snakes in the Jungle	Sabu ( as Mowgli ) is raised by wolves after his father is killed in the jungles of India . After a dozen or so years as an " animal " , he encounters a village of humans . The village includes his natural mother Rosemary DeCamp ( as Messua ) , who coincidently takes him in , and teaches him to speak English . But , adjusting to human life is difficult . Sabu discovers humans are a mixed bag ? Beautiful color photography is the highlight of " Jungle Book " . Additionally , the performance of Sabu is certainly intense ; his eyes , in introductory scenes , really seem like the eyes of someone raised by wolves ! Storyteller Joseph Calleia ( as Buldeo ) is charming . This is , however , a very lethargic movie . I expected to like the " village " scenes , but was surprised to favor the non-talking jungle scenes . Okay , GIANT English speaking SNAKES are exempt from the previous sentence . I did like the pursuit of the ordinary non-speaking tiger . Admittedly , I'm not a " Jungle Book " movie fan , but I do recall seeing another version ; and , this one is better . . .

" Mr . Dean ( as Latham ) plays a restless young man from Wisconsin , who has just ended his stint in Korea . With little luck hitchhiking after dark , Dean enters the diner , and orders coffee and a sandwich . Dean goes behind the counter to fix proprietor Murvyn Vye ( as Mike Deegan ) ' s broken coffee pot , revealing he's worked in diners . Mr . Vye needs help in the coffee shop , and offers Dean a job , and a room . With no place to go , Dean happily accepts . While tending tables , Dean meets pretty Pat Hardy ( as Ann Burnett ) , who becomes his girlfriend ( Hardy was a real-life friend of Dean ) . Dean feels his restless drifting may have ended , with a stable job , and relationship . After a date with Ms . Hardy , Dean overhears a conversation revealing his trusted benefactor is involved with local crime lord Edgar Stehli ( as Matt Schreiber ) . Though disillusioned , Dean stays in town , intending to avoid criminal activity . Mr . Stehli and Vye , however , have other plans . Vye tricks Dean into transporting some stolen goods ; and , while driving on an " unlighted road " , Dean's car draws gunfire . Dean's speedy attempt to get away causes the other car to swerve out of control , and crash . Racing back to the diner , Dean learns the other driver , a state trooper , has died . Now a " cop killer " , Dean must choose to work for gangster Stehli , or turn himself over to the police . . . Appearing after the premiere of " East of Eden " , this short drama was no great shakes , relatively speaking . Still , " The Unlighted Road " is a neat little play . Writer Walter C . Brown , Dean , and the cast perform admirably . With Brown's script , Dean is able create a sympathetic character . And , it's nice to see Dean , newly a big screen " movie star " , still appearing in an occasional small screen drama . The Unlighted Road ( / 55 ) Justus Addiss - James Dean , Murvyn Vye , Pat Hardy
452615	15896852	332280	6.0	The Memory Play's Tricks	" As teenagers , Allie ( Rachel McAdams ) and Noah ( Ryan Gosling ) begin a whirlwind courtship that soon blossoms into tender intimacy . The young couple is quickly separated by Allie's upper-class parents who insist that Noah isn't right for her . Several years pass , and , when they meet again , their passion is rekindled , forcing Allie to choose between her soul mate and class order . This beautiful tale has a particularly special meaning to an older gentleman ( James Garner ) who regularly reads the timeless love story to his aging companion ( Gena Rowlands ) , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . " The Notebook " is a pretty and predictable love story . Mr . Gosling and Ms . McAdams never seemed ( to me ) like they would age into characters like those essayed by Mr . Garner and Ms . Rowlands . Many times , the younger lovers appear to be modeling , rather than playing , their roles . The older couple is more enjoyable . Garner's performance , and narration , is particularly strong . James Marsden ( as Lon Hammond ) and Joan Allen ( as Anne Hamilton ) have interesting , underdeveloped roles . ( Ms . Allen may been channeling Ellen Burstyn's " Lois Farrow " ) . The " teenage " , and later , undressing scenes are very funny . And , some of the characters ' implausible actions ( the 365 letters , for example ) could be explained as embellishments and / or enhancements made by Rowlands ' character , in her " The Story of Our Lives " account . It is interesting that the lead characters write , at different times , a prolific amount of material to be read at a later time . With the exceptions of Robert Fraisse's photography and Gosling's dirty undershirt , the film applies too much gloss .

453075	15896852	8652	6.0	Frank Lloyd Raises the Dickens with William Farnum	Frank Lloyd's silent version of Charles Dickens ' " A Tale of Two Cities " may make you wonder why D . W . Griffith didn't direct his own version of the classic ( not that he didn't come close , on a few occasions ) . Mr . Lloyd's Griffith-like direction is a plus ; though , it's somehow not as good as the original . William Farnum , who was one of the leading actors of the teens , does a fine job in the leading role ; seeing Mr . Farnum play both as reluctant French nobleman " Charles Darnay " and English alcoholic lawyer " Sydney Carton " is , today , the main attraction . While filled with decent performances , the more famous sound re-makes lose something by casting different men in the lead roles . Beautiful Jewel Carmen has no trouble attracting both men , as " Lucie Manette " . And , Florence Vidor ( King's wife ) sews up stardom on the way to the guillotine . " A Tale of Two Cities " was considered a top production in its time , but it doesn't possess the timeless quality you'll find in many other silent movies .

453637	15896852	42994	6.0	Curtain Call	Without going into details , director Alfred Hitchcock's " Stage Fright " does something with a character's " point-of-view " that fatally flaws the film . By the last act , it will be obvious . It's surprising that so adept a director would " cheat " so ineffectively ; especially , when the technique can ( and has ) be done so well elsewhere . Possibly , Mr . Hitchcock is deliberately misleading the viewer , when he should be ambiguous . The picture is , otherwise , enjoyable . Wilkie Cooper's camera performs expertly . The cast , individually wonderful , never convincingly comes together . For example , it's difficult to believe Jane Wyman ( as Eve Gill ) is the daughter of Alistair Sim ( as Commodore Gill ) and Sybil Thorndike ( as Mrs . Gill ) . Still , Mr . Sim and Ms . Thorndike provide for a wealth of dry Hitchcock humor . Ms . Wyman and Marlene Dietrich ( as Charlotte Inwood ) are , of course , a treat ; and , they make the romantic entanglements as believable as possible . Leading men Richard Todd ( as Jonathan " Johnny " Cooper ) and Michael Wilding ( as Wilfred " Ordinary " Smith ) do their best opposite strong women and , especially in Mr . Todd's case , an unsure storyline . Kay Walsh ( as Nellie Goode ) leads the pack of smaller , delightful Hitchcock characters .

" The Matrix Reloaded " , the first of the inevitable sequels , sucks all the awesome special effects it can muster , and coats the screen with them . The underdeveloped storyline , which helped make the original more mysterious and imaginative , is filled in enough babble to expose it as significantly less than satisfactory . The creative balance of action , effects , and imagination is lost . The three main actors ( Reeves , Fishburne , and Moss ) are upstaged by " exciting new allies " . So , what's left ? - Although overwrought and onerous , the visual effects are STILL exciting , and the " Matrix Universe " isn't damaged beyond repair . Like they say , " To Be Concluded ?

Sometimes , " AntiTrust " comes on a little too pretty ; but , it's an all-around good effort . And , it definitely captures that sinking feeling you have when switching from a school-centered to a work-based lifestyle . Robbins ' character isn't hard to figure out , but he plays it deliciously . Ms . Forlani is truly fascinating ; " Does that make me Yoko ? " she asks . Mr . Howitt has a terrific cameo .

An updated , darker " Invisible Man " - with Kevin Bacon as the title character , and fantastic special effects - is ruined by a truly absurd storyline . The side effects of Twinkies are astonishing . And , you won't believe the healing powers of Duct Tape . For what it's worth , the scenes with Greg Grunberg ( as Carter Abbey ) show the subject of voyeurism handled well . As usual , Bacon is game .

452754	15896852	2199	7.0	Crossing the Water	In Palestine , a virgin named Mary ( Gene Gauntier ) is visited by one of God's angels ; subsequently , she becomes pregnant . Meanwhile , an angel of God invites Joseph , a son of David , to wed Mary . The angel explains that Mary's child is the savior Jesus Christ , who will grow up to save his people from their sins . The child grows up without fanfare ; but , as an adult ( Robert Henderson-Bland ) , Christ assembles disciples , and begins performing miracles . He is persecuted for his beliefs ; and , finally , he is crucified . For its time , a very good version of the often told story of Jesus Christ . Director Sidney Olcott and photographer George Hollister do very well ; their scenes with Mary , Joseph , and young Jesus in Egypt are a beautiful example . It's nice to see the scenes with Jesus as a child ; and , note the one where he carries a stick of lumber foreshadows the crucifixion . Mr . Henderson-Bland acts the part very well ; he is subdued , and looks comfortable in the role . Ms . Gauntier , who assisted Mr . Olcott greatly throughout the production , was certainly the film's most valuable player . The miracles scenes are very silly looking , and acted ; although , to be honest , I haven't seen enough people " raised from the dead " to judge the antics on screen . The " walking on water " might have worked if the water was a little calmer . There should have been more story explanation given for it , but the crucifixion elicited passion . Not the first " feature " film , but an important one ; for its lovely Egypt , Palestine , and Ireland location scenes . " From the Manger to the Cross " is the peak production from the early " Kalem " film company . Notably , it omits the resurrection ( some versions add it , from another film ) .

Frank Capra's " The Bitter Tea of General Yen " isn't as offensive as it appears , on the surface ; although , the story is , ultimately , unsatisfactory . Still , it's a fine looking production , with beautiful direction and photography ( Joseph Walker ) . Ms . Stanwyck and Mr .

But neither Spencer nor Jillian know that those 120 seconds of terror will ultimately threaten their sanity , their future and their lives in this heart stopping psychological thriller the critics call , ' One scary edge-of-the-seat nightmare ' , " according to the film's official synopsis . Everything you see about this movie gives away the story ; the trailer makes the plot obvious , and every other critic compares it to " Rosemary's Baby " ( 1968 ) . Indeed , it is an updated version of Roman Polanski's classic , with Aliens substituted for Satan - the old devil has clearly been replaced as top villain , after his 1960s-1970s heyday . Although nothing is outlined , anyone with rudimentary knowledge about plotting will figure out what's happening in " The Astronaut's Wife " ; its flaw is that it takes no real risks . Even the swipe has been done . Ms . Theron is the lead . She and Mr . Depp look great ( eyebrow and hair color are perfect ) , but Theron only has a couple of scenes approaching the level of Mia Farrow's characterization in " Rosemary's Baby " . She looks almost too good during her pregnancy , whereas Ms . Farrow looked more and more sickly . Director Rand Ravich shows promise more as a director than writer . Allen Daviau's photography is excellent . The film is so derivative it dims the impact of some excellent supporting performances , led by a dazzling Joe Morton ( as Sherman Reese ) . The moronic ending should be chopped off and sent to deleted scenes hell . . . before that , the film's strengths outweigh its weaknesses .

He expects to return to his old job as an automobile mechanic ; however , the boss breaks a promise , and turns Mr . Cagney away . In fact , the United States is descending into economic turmoil , which will end with " The Great Depression " . Unable to make an honest living , Cagney drifts into profitable " Prohibition " - era bootlegging . Valiant speakeasy hostess Gladys George ( as Panama Smith ) pines for Cagney , but he only has eyes for sweet Priscilla Lane ( as Jean Sherman ) . As the years roll along , Cagney's trusted lawyer Jeffrey Lynn ( as Lloyd Hart ) falls in love with pretty Ms . Lane ? Warner Brothers seems to have pulled out all the stops for " The Roaring Twenties " . Cagney , who had reached an extraordinary peak with the recently released gem " Angels with Dirty Faces " , is a marvel to watch , from beginning to end . Interestingly , after this film , Cagney sought to stop to his " gangster " image , until " White Heat " ( another gem , from 1949 ) . But , here , Cagney is still the victim of circumstances ; note , he does not become a criminal due to his nature . In this film , Cagney is another " Angel " , with a environmentally influenced " dirty face " . . . " The Roaring Twenties " is , also , about relationships ; or , to be more specific , it's about unexciting relationships . The only believable passion Cagney's character has is for best pal Frank McHugh ( as Danny Green ) , who needed some more expository scenes . The one that got away , Ms . George makes the most of a poorly scripted relationship between her character and " Eddie " - this is the pairing the film really serves up short shrift . The production is " top of the line , " , but the story is neither as strong , nor as artfully told as its studio's other " gangster " movies . Still , a star like Cagney , supporting players like Humphrey Bogart , and bit players down to Maurice Costello , make " The Roaring Twenties " purr .

453328	15896852	65856	7.0	Come See the Dark Shadows Vampires Do It	This is an excellent , flawed film spin-off of the classic TV serial " Dark Shadows " . It captures Jonathan Frid , Joan Bennett , Grayson Hall and many of the cast on film , in character , during the time of the original Dark Shadows-mania . For that , we should be eternally grateful . Other favorites David Selby , Kate Jackson , and Lara Parker can be found in the next Dark Shadows movie . What keeps this movie from becoming truly exceptional is that it overindulges . The thing you expect too happen in a vampire horror story happens over and over AND OVER again , to seemingly every character . It's all very stylish and well-done - but , it's OVERKILL . The production , by Dan Curtis is marvelous , but he takes the characters too , too far away from their television characterizations ; at times , they seem like strangers . If considered another in the band of Dark Shadows ' " Parallel Time " , it works . It's a surprise Dick Smith's make-up and Bob Cobert's music weren't Oscar-nominated .

453653	15896852	64886	7.0	Risky Mississippi Business	" Oh , Reivers ? that's an old-fashioned word from my childhood , " explains narrator Burgess Meredith , " In plain English , I'm afraid it meant ? thieves ! " The narrator is fondly recalling an adventure he had as an 11-year-old boy , " coming of age " in Mississippi . Young Mitch Vogel ( as Lucius Priest ) is the lad ; he accompanies father-figure / handyman Steve McQueen ( as Boon Hogganbeck ) , who steals the family's first automobile - a brand new , yellow-colored 1905 Winton Flyer . Rupert Crosse ( as Ned McCaslin ) makes " The Reivers " a trio by stowing away in the car's trunk . Their main destination is a bordello , where Mr . McQueen wants to hook up with prostitute girlfriend Sharon Farrell ( as Corrie ) . Meanwhile , Mr . Crosse swaps the trio's prized vehicle for a slow horse named " Lightning " ? Mark Rydell's direction of William Faulkner's final novel is a qualified success . The principal cast members work very well together , with Vogel and Crosse exhibiting as much star presence as the more famous McQueen . The supporting cast is great ; the participation of Will Geer , Burgess Meredith , and Juano Hernandez add to the film's old-world charm . Richard Moore's Mississippi photography is beautiful . Although it doesn't ever go quite far enough , " The Reivers " main strength is in its depiction of real , flawed characters . Faulkner's portrayal of race and gender , as much as they show , are noteworthy . The most touching moments occur when young Vogel learns that women are not viewed the same way , after adolescence .

452412	15896852	10662	7.0	Griffith Goes West	Subtitled " A Tale of the Old West , " director D . W . Griffith promises , " This story corroborates the old saying that truth is stranger than fiction - incidents being taken from actual episodes of those stirring days . " He means those western gold-fevered days in California , circa 1849 . Mr . Griffith ( with assistance from Elmer Clifton ) brings " Scarlet Days " to the expected climactic chase and rescue sequence , in a western setting . It's an excellent picture , overall , though obviously lesser than other Griffith films in release at the time . " Scarlet Days " joined " Broken Blossoms " ( at # 1 ) , " The Girl Who Stayed at Home " , and " True Heart Susie " in " The New York Times " ten best films of the year 1919 list . The main story involves " lonely , little " Carol Dempster ( as " Lady Fair " ) arriving in California to look for her long-absent mother , after the death of her aunt . In the west , Ms . Dempster's mother , Eugenie Besserer ( as " Rosy Nell " ) , has become an embarrassed dance-hall hostess , in order to save money for Dempster's education and dowry ( presumably ) . Upon arriving , irresistible Dempster attracts male attention from darkly handsome Richard Barthelmess ( as Don Maria Alvarez , " The Wandering Knight " ) , fair young hunk Ralph Graves ( as John Randolph , " Sir Whiteheart " ) , and lustful sleaze Walter Long ( as King Bagley , " Knight of the Black Stain " ) . At one point , Mr . Long forces Mr . Graves to watch him attempt raping Dempster . Another Griffith regular , Clarine Seymour ( as Chiquita , " Little Flameheart " ) , has a relatively satisfying role , as the piteous maiden who pines for Mr . Barthelmess . A Griffith regular and promising actress , Ms . Seymour died too soon , after one more film ( " The Idol Dancer " ) . Barthelmess and Graves do well , individually ; but , are a visual mismatch when sharing the screen . Gangly and eye-rolling , Dempster is unconvincing and miscast as the comely maiden . Ms . Besserer's " stained soul " portrayal of her mother is the stand-out performance . Scarlet Days ( / 19 ) D . W . Griffith - Richard Barthelmess , Carol Dempster , Eugenie Besserer
452790	15896852	16294	7.0	A Story of Past Relations	Joseph Schildkraut as ( Kenneth " Ken " Paulton ) and Jetta Goudal ( as Malena Paulton ) are honeymooning at the Grand Canyon ; but , Ms . Goudal is uninterested in consummating the marriage . This , understandably , frustrates Mr . Schildkraut , who can't explain a worsening pain in his arm . They are acquainted with the William Boyd ( as John " Jack " Moreland ) , a minister , who suggests Schildkraut ask God for relief from the hurt in his arm . Schildkraut prays for three weeks , to no avail . Meanwhile , the Reverend Boyd has met and fallen in love with Vera Reynolds ( as Elizabeth " Bess " Walsingham Tyrell ) , a " very modern young lady " who cools off when she finds out he is a minister . These four players act out their modern problems for about half the film ; THEN , fate arranges for them all to be on a train , bound for San Francisco - THEN , the train spectacularly crashes , head-on , into another train ! As the passengers whirl in the train wreckage , Reynolds is mysteriously transported back to 16th Century England . There , she finds faces which are familiar to her , but their personalities are slightly different - these are the " past lives " of her modern day friends and acquaintances . Reynolds assumes the identity of " Lady Elizabeth Tyrell " . Joseph Schildkraut is " Lord Strangevon " , William Boyd is " Reformado Jack " , and Jetta Goudal is " Black Melena " . By the time of the flashback , the film has shifted to feature Vera Reynolds as the star and protagonist ; earlier , " The Road to Yesterday " was a drama centering on the Paulton newlyweds . During the trip to the past , Reynolds ( and viewers ) discover the origins of mysterious stuff from the present . You'll see some startling events , culminating with a character being burned as a witch ! This is a very unusual film . The only story structure like it ( that I've seen ) is " Dark Shadows " TV flashback of 1967 , detailing Barnabas Collins ' 1700s origin . There is no vampire in " The Road to Yesterday " , but Schildkraut's rape of Goudal looks about the same ( attacked in a darkened room ? ) . Cecil B . DeMille directs some fine performances ; strangely , Reynolds and Boyd outdistance Schildkraut and Goudal as the film progresses . Boyd would later star as " Hopalong Cassidy " . I also enjoyed Reynolds ' less reverend fiancée , Casson Ferguson as " Adrian Thompkyns " ; and , Trixie Friganza as " Aunt Harriet , " who appears as a similar character in the past . Also , Frank Coghlan Jr . is memorable the freckle-faced boy ; he was a very popular child star , and played " Billy Batson " ( Captain Marvel ) during an incredibly long career . More potential is lost than realized in this intriguingly original film , from an older Beulah Marie Dix story - it's disappointing , ultimately , but a fascinating watch - nicely photographed by J . Peverell Marley . With some more work , it might have been one of the better DeMilles ( see " The Cheat " and " The Whispering Chorus " for great DeMilles ) . Note : After the witch is burned at the stake , a fleeting title card flashes - I freeze-framed to see , and it reads , " The Road to Yesterday - End of Part 9 " ; probably , signaling the End of Reel 9 . Also note , in the past , Reynolds character reveals she is from 1926 ; the film was released at the end of 1925 , but DeMille expected most would be watching in 1926 .

453426	15896852	18515	7.0	Lewis of Arabia	William Boyd and Louis Wolheim are the " Two Arabian Knights " referred to in the title , humorously . The pair start out as U . S . POWs trying to escape from the Germans during World War I . Eventually , they find themselves on board a ship bound for Arabia . While tripping out to the Middle East , they rescue an Arab woman , Mary Astor , who turns out to be a Princess ; and , of course , becomes a romantic interest for the " Two Arabian Knights " . No points for guessing who wins the veiled Ms . Astor ! The film is very well photographed and directed ; Lewis Milestone has wonderful sets , and stages scenes beautifully . Of the performances , Mr . Wolheim stands out - he creates a character so understandable you can almost hear him speak , trough the film is silent . The story isn't as strong as it could be - there are some events and sequences which had me wondering how and why the characters ' locale changed . The last looks , exchanged between one of the stars and an extra , is an example of something I didn't understand . Perhaps these were comic bits which had a particular appeal for the time . The film is damaged in several places ; but there is enough preserved , in even these scenes , to allow your mind to fill in the visual blanks . Boris Karloff appears as the " Purser " ; watch for his big scene on ship , when Wolheim goes into a room with him for some money ( what actually happens is a mystery ) . Early in the film , there is a long scene with a lot of naked men shown from the waist up ( or , thereabouts ) ; they are POWs being herded to the showers . Director Milestone uses parades of soldiers moving to great effect ; this " shower " scene is different in that several of the men don't look as Caucasian as you might expect - maybe not as many Caucasian men would agree to appear nude ?

453320	15896852	16461	7.0	Dust in the Wind	In the 1939 re-release's introduction , William S . Hart explains , " The story of ' Tumbleweeds ' marks one of the greatest epochs of our American history . It tells of the opening of the Cherokee Strip in the year 1889 . Twelve hundred square miles of Cherokee Indian lands , on one front , over two hundred miles long , were thrown open by our government to those seeking good earth upon which they might make their homes . " Mr . Hart ( as Don Carver ) and comic sidekick Lucien Littlefield ( as Kentucky Rose ) are two of the cattle ranchers who are put out when as the Oklahoman Cherokee Strip is " thrown open " by the government . For Hart , the silver lining comes in the form of a several decades younger sweetheart , homesteader Barbara Bedford ( as Molly Lassiter ) ; however , her nasty half-brother J . Gordon Russell ( as Noll Lassiter ) threatens to spoil the fun . Little brother Jack Murphy ( as Bart Lassiter ) and his pup have the highest profile relationship that actually works . Still , the film has Hart ; and , its exciting " land rush ! " sequence . The re-release ( which , apart from Hart's cool Shakespearian appearance , is the inferior version , by the way ) features the legendary star's farewell : " My friends , I loved the art of making motion pictures . It is as the breath of life to me ? no longer a cloud of dust , but a beautiful golden haze through which appears a long phantom herd of trailing cattle . At their head , a Pinto pony ? with an empty saddle ? the boys up ahead are calling - - they're waiting for you and me to help drive this last great round-up into eternity ? " Adios , amigos . God bless you all , each and every one . "
452357	15896852	49061	7.0	Who's Afraid of Bette Davis ?	" The Catered Affair " was the movie adaptation of a Paddy Chayefsky's TV drama , which starring Thelma Ritter and Pat Henning . I'm guessing this was made due to the success of Ernest Borgnine's " Marty " . The film is interesting in its depiction of a different time , when the ceremonial aspects of weddings were very strange . Today , I doubt these people would go on and on about such trivialities . But , then , there were certain " ways " people married . There are some terrific " period " scenes . The Hurley's home is a real time trip . Great kitchen ! I loved the scene when Bette Davis takes in the frozen laundry from a clothesline outside her window . Ms . Davis totally commands the film - at times , her presence is overbearing . Her performance is excellent , but sometimes veers very close to going over-the-top . Ernest Borgnine , Debbie Reynolds , and Barry Fitzgerald hold their own in Davis ' presence . I believe , due to the presence of Bette Davis , the film should have been altered to focus more on her character . Reworked , this could have been Davis ' " Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? " You really have to pay attention to get what the film is really about - there is one instance where Davis ' own wedding is explained . There should be more about both Davis's dwelling on the past , and Borgnine's hopes for the future . The Catered Affair ( 1956 ) Richard Brooks - Bette Davis , Ernest Borgnine , Debbie Reynolds
452445	15896852	16039	7.0	Jurassic Start	" This was the first screen adaptation of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle story of prehistoric creatures still alive on a remote Amazon plateau . An expedition is lead ( sic ) by Professor Challenger and consists of a newspaper reporter , a big-game hunter , and his servant as well as the daughter of the plateau's discoverer , who is still stranded in this uncharted land . After a long journey , the group finds the prehistoric land and encounters all kinds of remarkable plants , dinosaurs , and ape-like men , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Arthur Conan Doyle's " The Lost World " makes its impressive movie debut ; the creatures , characters , and situations continue to be imitated , with no end in sight . Oddly enough , this silent version is a case where the original is not the greatest . Herein , the creatures and humans are not scripted , directed , or edited to full advantage ; at times , it seems as if the characters are watching a dinosaur movie . More interaction between dinosaur and human was difficult , but possible ; a similar lack of contact between apeman and human is inexplicable . The possibilities lost in this outing would be found , to the extreme , in " King Kong " ( 1933 ) ; a film which makes excellent use of Willis O'Brien's extraordinary stop motion animation effects . That film certainly takes fuller advantage of human / animal interaction . " The Lost World " adds Bessie Love ( as Paula White ) , to up the expedition's romance level . Ms . Love's character wasn't even in the original novel ; so , it's an understandably weak addition . However , she helps adventurer Lewis Stone ( as John Roxton ) give the film's best performance ; as his longing for Love is just about the only interesting " non-creature " element . Wallace Beery ( as Professor Challenger ) and Lloyd Hughes ( as Edward Malone ) are good , as the film's other leading players . Unfortunately , the film includes not only explicit , but also implicit racially insensitive and inaccurate images .
453520	15896852	10103	7.0	The Eyes of Clara Are Upon You	Clara Kimball Young ( as Gina Ashling ) is at a crossroads in her life - - she has a promising operatic voice , and is invited to pursue a career in Paris ; her family , however , wants her to remain at home and help support the family . She is also being courted by a wealthy man ; however , she does not love him , and would only be marrying for financial security . ENTER a disciple from the East - - the spiritual-type Hindu ( played by Vincent Serrano , he is introduced in the film's opening ) ; he arrives to show Ms . Kimball Young his Crystal Ball - - in which she sees her future . This is an impressively mounted silent film production , with a great cast , and an ambitious story structure . The mysterious Hindu man's crystal ball provides heroine Kimball Young ( and movie viewers ) the opportunity to " see " three different future scenarios : In " The Path of Duty " she stays with the family and becomes a schoolteacher . In " The Path of Ambition " she pursues her operatic singing career . In " The Path of Wealth " she marries for money and security . You may believe a Hindu can show Kimball Young the future in a crystal ball - - but , some of the unfolding events , and choices , strain credulity . Schoolteachers and career-women are wretched creatures ! Kimball Young's performance is the film's highlight . She is not consistently great ; but , her best scenes are enough to explain her status as one of the decade's top actresses . For example , in a " Duty " scene , she checks her aged appearance in a mirror effectively . Her best work occurs in the film's final " Wealth " segment - - incredibly , she transforms herself into a gaunt , drug-addicted street-walker . The scenes with the desolate Kimball Young walking rain-drenched streets are convincing , and artful . Director Albert Parker and Kimball Young are assisted by a fine supporting cast - - the Ashling family includes brother Gareth Hughes , sister Pauline Starke , and father Sam Southern . Kimball Young's suitors include Milton Sills , Edmund Lowe , and Ralph Lewis - - all performing well . The most notable supporting player , in hindsight , is Rudolph Valentino as smarmy " Cabaret Parasite " Clarence Morgan ; he further elevates the film's fine " Path of Wealth " segment . Valentino watchers should note he appears about 50 minutes into the production . Eyes of Youth ( / 19 ) Albert Parker - Clara Kimball Young , Edmund Lowe , Rudolph Valentino
452625	15896852	13140	8.0	A Woman and Her Money Are Soon Parted	Three Russian aristocrats lease a villa from which they can luxuriously enjoy Monte Carlo . They are : maid-pinching Maude George ( as Princess Olga Petchnikoff ) , blonde-wigged Mae Busch ( as Princess Vera Petchnikoff ) , and monocled lady-killer Erich von Stroheim ( as Count Wladislaw Sergius Karamzin ) . You should also keep an eye on their foolish maid , Dale Fuller ( as Maruschka ) . Mr . von Stroheim is the film's star , director , and writer . It becomes obvious the trio are really counterfeiting con artists . The gang of three are intrigued by the notice of the arrival of American Envoy Rudolph Christians ( as Andrew J . Hughes ) and his wife Miss DuPont ( as Helen ) ; they decide to strike up a societal acquaintanceship with the Americans , to help provide cover for their swindling . Then , von Stroheim shows Ms . DuPont his stiff cane , and give her bare legs a leer ? Have a great laugh when Ms . DuPont , while applying her face cream , declares she is twenty-one years old ; husband's reply he that is a sun-burned forty-one shows he can shave off years with the best of them . Mr . Christians died during the production , and his white-haired replacement , back to the camera , is obvious ; with all the expense obviously spent on " Foolish Wives " , it's difficult to understand why von Stroheim could not add a little bit of cheap shoe polish to Robert Edeson's head . There are other problems with the story , which was brutally cut down from a multi-hour epic . Still , the studio heads could not cut the neither the length of von Stroheim's cigarettes , nor the fact that his ( vanity ) production of " Foolish Wives " retains its spectacle .
452359	15896852	47849	8.0	Stranger in Town	Spencer Tracy is an old one-armed man who goes to town in " Bad Day at Black Rock " . He wants to give a medal to an old war buddy's father ( who saved his life ) . I was a little confused by this backstory ; I wondered why everyone didn't just tell Mr . Tracy his friend's father passed away . Now , that I think about it , I'm sure the filmmakers must have wanted us to think Tracy's character was much younger . That , and one of Tracy's almost super-human feats , are the film's major flaws . Otherwise , it's great . Tracy's performance carried the film - he is an immediate visual intrusion on this old western-style town ; instead of western gear , he wears a regular suit . Although it's a dark suit , Tracy's performance relays the fact that he is the " good guy " . John Sturges does an excellent job directing ; I've seen the Sturges credit on a number of films , and believe this may be his best . Robert Ryan and the citizens of Black Rock work very well indeed with Sturges and Tracy . This is a film I'm looking forward to seeing again .

452458	15896852	36962	8.0	Writing on the Wall	" It Happened Tomorrow " could have stood a better beginning - the choice to introduce the story with elderly Dick Powell and Linda Darnell ( as Larry and Sylvia Smith ) celebrating 50 years of wedded bliss sacrifices the story's surprises . The film does possess the light touch required to make the framing sequence charming . But , director René Clair and Mr . Powell build an unexpectedly good level of suspense regarding Powell's courtship , and mortality . They are so good , you can almost forget how much the opening gives away ? Watch for a thoroughly delightful ( and unfortunately rare ) performance by sagely John Philliber ( as " Pop " Benson ) . He plays the keeper of the " Evening News " " morgue " ( a place where newspapers keep obituaries and other files ) . Possibly , Mr . Philliber had read his own notice ; he died in 1944 . Powell was also able to read the writing on the wall , and saved his fledgling career by pursuing more interesting roles ( like this one ) . Jackie Oakie and Edgar Kennedy are also on board . A subtle celebration of life , and its mysteries . It Happened Tomorrow ( / 44 ) René Clair - Dick Powell , Linda Darnell , John Philliber
453130	15896852	38975	8.0	Some Must Watch	A serial murderer is on the loose , in a New England town . The killer's latest victim succumbs as maid / companion Dorothy McGuire ( as Helen ) enjoys one of the town theater's latest silent movie " flickers " , directed by D . W . Griffith . Her employers , the wealthy Warren family , believe Ms . McGuire's life is in danger , as she is a mute ; and , all the victims have suffered from a disability . Their concerns are , of course , dead on . " The Spiral Staircase " is as unpredictable as the sunrise ; and , McGuire's physical condition , ( presumably , she's a self-inflicted mute ) strains credulity to extreme limits - but , the film's direction , performances , and overall style are so well-done , it doesn't matter . Director Robert Siodmak and star McGuire are beautifully matched . Steadfast George Brent ( as Albert Warren ) and nipping Elsa Lanchester ( as Mrs . Oates ) lead the charge , in choice roles . But , Ethel Barrymore ( as Mrs . Warren ) is especially commanding ; she acts up a storm , though confined to a sick bed . Barrymore's cranky , creepy , and perceptive performance is the film's most riveting . By the way , the silent film McGuire sees during the opening murder is not " The Kiss " , but " The Sands of Dee " ( 1912 ) , starring Mae Marsh and Robert Harron . Ms . Marsh does receive a fateful kiss in the old film , but it is not shown . " The Spiral Staircase " picks up with Marsh being thrown out of the house by her parents , after a fling with a painter . Mr . Harron is the young man who frantically searches for his departed love . Harron was one of the 1910s best actors ( perhaps the best ) ; and , the emotions he helps elicit from McGuire's " Helen " ring true .

453434	15896852	37059	8.0	Home is Where the Heart Is	Judy Garland ( star ) and Vincente Minnelli ( director ) team-up for a classic MGM musical . Ms . Garland is the focus of the camera's attention as part of a sweet St . Louis family ; with younger sister Margaret O'Brien following close behind . The other players are suitably supporting . The film is beautifully photographed , with extraordinary colorful sets and locations . This " Smith Family of St . Louis " is a studio " creation " , and probably looks like no actual St . Louis town that ever existed - - but , that is irrelevant . The film's musical numbers are very strong , with " Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas " my choice the highlight ( it's nearer the end of the film ) . " The Trolley Song " and title song are not far behind . Garland performs them perfectly . I thought the song " You and I " was very much like the song " True Love " - - it seems like one swiped the other . Ms . O'Brien is both sweet and tearful , holding her own with a stellar cast . She played the role wonderfully , but I was distracted by some of her character's actions . I have been through a lot of Halloweens , but never like the one O'Brien experiences . Perhaps that is how the evening was celebrated ? I found it strange , even with her " bad girl " tendencies . Note also the film as a message curiously similar to " The Wizard of Oz " .

Ms . Lynley has arrived from America , to join her London-based journalist brother , Mr . Dullea . After some shopping , Lynley goes to pick up her daughter from school , but ? " Bunny Lake Is Missing " . Soon , sleuthing Laurence Olivier ( as Inspector Newhouse ) arrives to investigate the disappearing child ; but , unexpectedly , he has trouble finding evidence " Bunny Lake " has ever existed . Director Otto Preminger artfully holds interest , as his psychological thriller gets creepy on you . Lynley and Dullea are quite effective , and intriguing , as the oddly coupled siblings . Olivier is as arresting as ever . Hindsight will prove the story cheats ; however , it doesn't deter from the viewing pleasure . The supporting cast is fantastic . Noel Coward ( as Horatio Wilson ) is the reddest herring around , but highly amusing . Martita Hunt ( as Aida Ford ) is delightful as the frightfully intuitive woman upstairs . The sets and photography ( Denys N . Coop ) are terrific . And , you can't beat The Zombies , performing " Remember You " , " Just Out of Reach " , and " Nothing's Changed " . Cheers !

453014	15896852	41239	8.0	In the Ring with Kirk Douglas	Kirk Douglas delivers an astonishing performance as rags-to-riches boxer . " Champion " is a dark film , told in flashback . The main feature is Mr . Douglas ' performance , but it also works as a " boxing film " - however , don't expect Douglas's character or the film to be typical 1940s Hollywood film . This is a film which raises questions about this " sport " and others . It's well written ( for the time ) and directed Mark Robson . There are some other good performances ; in particular , Arthur Kennedy as Douglas ' brother ; when the story first flashbacked , the two actors were very believable as brothers . This kind of drama might seem a little tired , at times , because it's been done so many times since , and the scenario is ( or , has become ) so predictable . Oh , and you have to just go along with Douglas and Kennedy being named " Midge " and " Connie " . Champion ( 1949 ) Mark Robson - Kirk Douglas , Arthur Kennedy , Ruth Roman
452877	15896852	14440	8.0	Beautiful Spectacle from Ingram with Novarro	Ramon Novarro stars as André-Louis Moreau . Lewis Stone is Moreau's enemy , the Marquis de la Tour d'Azyr . And , Alice Terry is the woman they both love , Aline de Kercadiou . The story is set during the time of the French Revolution . The film begins with Mr . Stone as the Marquis de la Tour killing Mr . Novarro ( Moreau's ) best friend , which makes them great enemies . Enemies usually like the same woman ; in this case , the coveted Ms . Terry ( as Aline ) creates the additional animosity . This is a well-produced spectacle , from director Rex Ingram ; the film obviously cost a fortune , and the money was well spent , creating a beautiful looking film . Mr . Ingram does a great job of pacing the approximately two hours of film ; it retains much of its pace today , relative to other 1920s epics . Ingram's cinematographer John F . Seitz and star Ramon Novarro are indispensable . Mr . Seitz ' photography is great , from the windmilly opening until the final conflicts . Some of the spectacular scenes are still terrific ; but , some do look like they were staged to fit the movie screen , where everyone gathers for " Action ! " Mr . Novarro's lead performance is excellent ; though , it might have been wise to let him use more of the ahead-of-their-time skills that are clearly evident . But , what's left is fine - best are the " looks " from the performers , which are not overacted ( mostly ) . Lewis , Terry , and most everyone performs well . Novarro must join an acting troupe , by the way , while on-the-run - he becomes " Monsieur X " and play acts clown " Scaramouche " , giving the film its title . Watch for the relationship between Novarro and a woman from the troupe , and the reason he finally rejects her ( it parallels the major love triangle ) . Also , watch for two of the characters to startlingly look exactly like / alike the " shocking " second revelation at the end of the film .

452836	15896852	393109	8.0	Rian Johnson Makes an Impression with Joseph Gordon-Levitt	In sunny Southern California , love-spurned loner Joseph Gordon-Levitt ( as Brendan Frye ) discovers his former girlfriend's dead body in a watery tunnel . In flashback , Mr . Gordon-Levitt recalls a strung-out Emilie de Ravin ( as Emily Kostich ) reaching out for help , explaining , " I screwed up real bad . " Unfortunately , the soon-to-be-dead blonde speaks in riddles . So , Gordon-Levitt is left with word clues - like " Brick " , " Tug " , " Frisco " , and " Pin " . Cross-legged genius Matt O'Leary ( as Brain ) provides assistance ; fortunately , he remembers everyone's locker number . Realizing the authorities are clueless , Gordon-Levitt decides to carry on his own investigation , beginning with doped-up rival Noah Segan ( as Dode ) . Gordon-Levitt infiltrates the drug ring managed by creepy Tolkien reader Lukas Haas ( as The Pin ) , after mixing with femme fatale Nora Zehetner ( as Laura ) and bodyguard Noah Fleiss ( as Tug ) . Alas , the closer Gordon-Levitt gets to solving the mystery of his ex's death , the more he gets smacked down . " Brick " shimmers with potential . Most obviously , debuting director / writer / editor Rian Johnson makes a great impression ; there is always something interesting happening on Mr . Johnson's screen . Steve Yedlin's crisp photography , and Nathan Johnson's peaking music , are great mood enhancers . Lead actor Gordon-Levitt continues to work wonders with interesting , offbeat roles ; and , importantly , shows he can " carry " a film , with his singular characterization . The story updates 1940s " film noir " quite effectively . The high school setting may have been a mistake ; other than the high-school grounded Mr . O'Leary , the " Brick " cast seem more like post-high school deadbeats . Gordon-Levitt visits his Assistant Vice Principal ( Richard Roundtree ) , but , nobody ever goes to class ; and , there are no scenes in the cafeteria or gym , either . The settings used , instead , are a real treat . Paintings , posters , birds , vehicles , and water add stillness and movement to backgrounds ; but , the movie is never gimmickry or busy . Perhaps the best inside joke ( and a great visual to boot ) was dressing up Mr . Haas as Jonathan Frid from " Dark Shadows " , with his Inverness-styled cape , and cane ; in silhouette , and behind a screen door , Haas even looks like " Barnabas Collins " . As a former " Dark Shadows " star , Gordon-Levitt would have been familiar with the figure ; he played " David Collins " and " Daniel Collins " during the series ' 1991 incarnation . " Brick " is a film to watch with focus and concentration ; if you can't bring those , wait for the right frame of mind .

452361	15896852	45793	9.0	From Montgomery Clift to Eternity	Fred Zinnemann's " From Here to Eternity " is really more of a soap opera than a war story . Still , it is very well done , and very entertaining . The main attraction isn't World War II , or the soap opera story lines - the main attractions in " From Here to Eternity " are the actors ' performances . Montgomery Clift's is the " main attraction " performance . He makes his character the central figure , despite other story lines , and his performance is mesmerizing . Every look Clift gives , every facial tic , every syllable is fascinating to watch . And , it's all very natural ? very character-driven . Not that all the others aren't terrific , too . Burt Lancaster is a close second , and everyone performs exceptionally well . Mr . Clift's performance helps elevate both the other performances , and the film in general . Check out how great he makes all the other actors , " look " simply by playing a bugle . This is a case where an actor's performance affects both the other players in the scene , and even leaves its impressions in scenes where the actor doesn't appear . If you take Clift out of the film , you have a much more ordinary movie . I'm not sure , however , what / if the film is trying to say about war - is it making a statement of some kind ? The main story is : Will Mr . Clift's character box ( fight ) ? or , won't he fight ( box ) ? I guess he is bullied into fighting , but does not initiate fighting ( he blinds a man , symbolically , by knocking him out in an unseen fight ) . I am not sure if I got the film's message , or even if there was one . I would have also made either MORE EXPLICIT or MORE SUBTLE the whole prostitution part - it was a place to have sex during the time , I guess . Donna Reed and the other women were prostitutes , I guess . Since they couldn't make it more explicit , they toned it down to make us really think these men went to town so they could exchange " nice " smiles with " nice " women . Elsewhere , Mr . Lancaster and Ms . Kerr's sound like they've had physical relations , when , it looked , to me , like they'd only been hit by a wave . I know this was the ' 50s , but filmmakers had developed many subtle ways of relaying this information ? for the prior half century ! So , what it boils down to : This is a great wartime soap opera , with great performances .

453406	15896852	23948	9.0	John Barrymore and Marie Dressler are the Main Course	David O . Selznick and MGM's " Dinner at Eight " is a great comedy-drama follow-up to " Grand Hotel " . Although it seems to have been less critically acclaimed ( back then , at least ) , it's actually a little better . The story , characters , and setting are more related ; they are all affected by the " Great Depression " , and involved , directly or indirectly , with Lionel Barrymore ( as Oliver Jordan ) and Billie Burke ( as Millicent Jordan ) ' s planned dinner party . One story , or subplot , in " Dinner at Eight " is much superior to the rest of the dramatic elements ; it is the story of washed-up alcoholic actor John Barrymore ( as Larry Renault ) . While never less than good , no other story strand approaches Mr . Barrymore's riveting mini-drama . Barrymore and Lee Tracy ( as Max Kane ) perform especially well together . The other truly exceptional performance honor goes to Marie Dressler ( as Carlotta Vance ) . Ms . Dressler doesn't have her own " play " ; instead , her character serves an interlocking purpose . And , she carries the rest of the movie . Director George Cukor , photographer William Daniels , and the several credited writers are noteworthy , particularly for the Barrymore / Tracy scenes . Ms . Burke , Jean Harlow ( as Kitty Packard ) , and Louise Closser Hale ( as Hattie Loomis ) are among the others in top form . Watch Barrymore's increasingly desperate " Larry Renault " and Dressler's wise overseeing " Carlotta Vance " , for iconic performances from stars at their peak ; in , at least , the best supporting characterizations of the year .

453082	15896852	20768	9.0	Silence Is Golden for F . W . Murnau and Charles Farrell	Minnesota country boy Charles Farrell ( as Lem ) goes to Chicago , to sell the family's wheat harvest . In the hectic city , he meets pretty coffee shop waitress Mary Duncan ( as Kate ) , who longs for the simple life . The attractive pair fall blissfully in love . After marrying Ms . Duncan , Mr . Farrell takes her home to live with his country family . But , father David Torrence ( as Tustine ) distrusts the " City Girl " , and is angry with his son for selling his wheat at an inferior price . A stern patriarch , Mr . Torrence drives a wedge between the happy couple . To make matters worse , Duncan becomes prey for some arriving reapers ? This is another stunner from director F . W . Murnau ( " Sunrise " ) , who would so tragically die in a car accident ( after only one more film ) . " City Girl " was produced by Mr . Murnau as a " silent " ( " Our Daily Bread " ) ; but , Fox Films recalled the movie , and turned it into a " talkie " . At the time , Farrell's name was rising to the upper reaches of " Box Office " star lists , but , truth be told , only Charlie Chaplin and Greta Garbo still had the power to draw audiences to a silent movie ( and , even that was fading ) . With re-shoots , a partially talking " City Girl " was seen briefly , and forgotten . The unearthed full length silent version was , thankfully , preserved . It is a near-perfect film . Farrell , who many felt deserves some " Best Actor " recognition fro his role in " 7th Heaven " , outdoes himself . Murnau , photographer Ernest Palmer , set director Harry Oliver are also award-worthy . Although she looks too startlingly glamorous in the country portions , Duncan is hot in the city . No wonder leering Richard Alexander ( as Mac ) couldn't keep his hands off her . The entire cast performs splendidly , right down to David Rollins giving Duncan lift at work . Sequences to re-play ( if not the whole movie ) : Farrell walking the crowded city streets , Duncan in her apartment ( where she blows the city dust off her suffocating plant ) , the couple's ecstatic run through his father's wheat fields , the arrival of grinning Guinn Williams and the reapers , and their harvesting scenes . Murnau's direction of the horse-driven wagons is especially spectacular . The lighting is brilliant throughout . City Girl ( / 30 ) F . W .

452452	15896852	71647	9.0	What Happens When We Run Out	" A group of research scientists based at an Idaho facility discovers a means to travel forward in time , whilst remaining at the same locale . When one of the group's trips reveals a bleak future for the human race , the government steps in to shut down their research . The researchers decide to travel forward in time to find the cause of the horrible accident that apparently will ruin the ecology and threaten the very existence of man , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Actually , the research scientists send young people to the future , to study the discovered ecological crisis ; and , the young men and women contemplate starting a futuristic civilization there . Watch for the lead actress Kelly Bohanan ( as Karen ) visit the dentist early in the running time ; she emerges as the film's main character . Without her metallic dental braces , Ms . Bohanan is able to join sister Caroline Hildebrand ( as Isa ) in time traveling exploration . Ms . Hildebrand and sister Bohanan nonchalantly take off their pants for the camera ; because , anything with metal ( like zippers or buttons ) must be put in the " Material Projection Department " for time travel . The women are very attractive , but nothing is gratuitous . The first scene with Hildebrand explains the rules of time travel to Bohanan is where the film first grabs you . It is absolutely ludicrous : two hippie-type women explaining time trip rules , in their underwear ; but , it is also absolutely believable . " Idaho Transfer " succeeds , at this " guidelines for travel " moment , because you are ( or should be ) putting your trust in the young travelers . It's obviously going to be a very unusual movie . Most of the characters ' dialogue helps explain events ; still , it's not always clear what is happening , or where . And , yet , the movie is never dishonest . Director Peter Fonda and writer Thomas Matthiesen create a very captivating , thought-provoking world , with its own rules . Mr . Fonda should consider directing more often ; and , with the so often neglected type of performances from this cast . Kevin Hearst ( as Ronald ) emerges as Bohanan's " leading man " ; and , Keith Carradine is most notable among the other players . Although Fonda undoubtedly guided them , it's surprising so few in the cast achieved later fame , especially Bohanan . The character " Karen " is where you will find the real story ; it's in her almost constant longing for a child . Bohanan's face , and Fonda's camera , capture the desire frequently . And , of course , it is not an easy prospect . " Ronald " may be homosexual and / or asexual , along with others . Although it is discussed , you won't see sex . The desire for children symbolizes hope for the future , which may not be likely , in this world . Instead , industry eats up , and ruins things , like the derelict car " Karen " and " Ronald " find . And , literally , the train Mr . Hearst discovers has " eaten " its skeletal passengers . The ending is a perfect culmination of events . The ecological and environmental issues addressed in " Idaho Transfer " were certainly ahead of the curve .

When the suspicious officer asks to see some identification , Mr . Basehart shows him the barrel his gun . Soon , cop-killer Basehart is being perused by Scott Brady ( as Marty Brennan ) and the Los Angeles Police Department . Basehart proves himself to be a quite resourceful ; notably ; he uses the city's sewers as an escape route ? With masterful use of light and shadows , from cinematographer John Alton , " He Walked by Night " is one of the most visually striking films of the 1940s . Basehart's psychotic star performance is also award-worthy ; especially , after witnessing his character operate on himself , in close-up , to remove a bullet . The supporting cast is a treasure trove , among them : Roy Roberts as the determined police captain , Dorothy Adams as the loony lady on Brady's milk run , Whit Bissell as Basehart's bookish friend , Billy Mauch as the mugging head of a teen gang , and Jack Webb learning how to make " Dragnet " a west coast version of " The Naked City " . And , that's not all ; read the extended cast list on IMDb before watching , so you don't miss anyone !
453000	15896852	12190	9.0	Last Tango in Paris	Europe is " a world old in hatred and bloodshed , where nation is crowded against nation and creed against creed , centuries of war have sown their bitter seed , and the fires of resentment smoldering beneath the crust of civilization but await the breaking of the Seven Seals of Prophecy to start a mighty conflagration . " But , in the Americas , " boundless space offers a haven to the alien , and ancient hatreds are forgotten . " In the " New World " , Pomeroy Cannon ( as Madariaga ) and his family thrive . Mr . Cannon's eldest daughter Bridgetta Clark ( as Luisa ) marries German Alan Hale ( as Karl von Hartrott ) , and they have three sons . Youngest daughter Mabel Van Buren ( as Elena ) marries French Josef Swickard ( as Marcelo Desnoyers ) , and they sire son Rudolph Valentino ( as Julio Desnoyers ) and daughter Virginia Warwick ( as Chichi ) . From the preceding family of characters , you should pay relatively close attention to Mr . Valentino's " Julio " and Mr . Swickard's " Desnoyers " , who emerge as two of the drama's three leading players ; they are patriarch Cannon's favorite grandson and son , respectively . When the old man dies , the sisters ' families move back to their husbands ' home countries of Germany and France . Valentino studies art , thrills the French with his " Argentine Tango " , and begins an affair with married woman Alice Terry ( as Marguerite Laurier ) . Ms . Terry , wife of director Rex Ingram , is the third player of prominence . Several supporting players stand out ; perhaps none more than two men Valentino becomes acquainted with , in France : servile companion Bowditch M . Turner ( as Argensola ) and mysterious " man upstairs " ( hint , hint ! ) Nigel de Brulier ( as Tchernoff ) . Eventually , events culminate into " The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse " fulfilling its promise ; it becomes a story of The Great War ( aka World War I ) . Ibáñez ( and adapter June Mathis ) ' " Four Horsemen " are : Conquest , War , Pestilence , and Death . The war scenes are exciting . In a great crosscutting sequence , Valentino throws Mr . Turner out of the apartment , so he can " entertain " Terry . Due to a downpour , Turner goes upstairs to visit with mysterious Mr . de Brulier , who cuts into the forbidden fruit of an apple , while Valentino ( off screen ) similarly removes Terry's " beautiful covering " and " cloak of virtue . " No sexual relations are shown , but director Ingram clearly makes his point . And , all of this occurs as the Great War erupts . The film's overall thesis is unsteady , at times ; and , there are little things ( like animals ) to distract - - does nurse Terry's husband fail to recognize her voice ? Award-worthy Valentino and Terry speak French in France , by the way - - regardé , for example , " Oui " for " Yes " . " The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse " is a triumph for Mr . Ingram , photographer John F . Seitzand , and company . Despite some flaws , it's an indispensable film .

453677	15896852	10806	10.0	The Height of Sentimentality	Lillian Gish ( as True Heart Susie ) is an ordinary country girl ; she is in love with typical " boy-next-door " Robert Harron ( as William Roberts ) . The film begins with a series of seemingly silly , sentimental , and hopelessly old-fashioned observations about the relationships between men and women like " True Heart Susie " and " William Roberts " . Director D . W . Griffith astutely notes , " Of course they don't know what poor simple idiots they are - - and , we , who have never been so foolish , an hardly hope to understand ? " You can tell , early on , that minister-to-be Harron is not really interested , romantically , in Gish . Harron prefers the " kind " of woman later idealized by Clarine Seymour ( as Bettina ) . Ms . Seymour leads a fine supporting cast , as the painted and partying " other woman " . Gish tries " power and stockings " , but it is not in her character . When she accidentally chances upon Harron and Seymour kissing , Gish realizes circumstances are beyond her control , and Harron is lost to her - - this is followed by an incredible close-up of Gish , which defies description . With " True Heart Susie " , director Griffith and company achieve " non-epic " perfection . In its own way , the film is as " epic " as the director's " Intolerance " ( 1916 ) . Ms . Gish and Mr . Harron are superb , as usual ; though they are young adults , they are thoroughly convincing as opening-scene schoolchildren . The performances are almost outerworldly ; especially , after Harron expresses discontent , and Gish reacts . Gish's reactions are particularly amazing ; in fact , this may be her most supreme silent-era achievement , besting her own performance in the recently released " Broken Blossoms " ( 1919 ) . If " Best Actress " awards were given out in 1919 , Lillian Gish's " True Heart Susie " might have won over her own lead performance in " Broken Blossoms " . Truly classic .

452567	15896852	62622	10.0	" Open the Pod Bay doors , HAL . . . "	Since so much will be written about this film , I will be brief . I have seen " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " all the way through , twice . There are some parts I've watched separately , but I saw none of the film until AFTER 2001 . So , obviously , I think it has a timeless quality . I consider Stanley Kubrick's work on this film to be art , which really doesn't " age " . I believe there is also a point where " flaws " become irrelevant , and " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " reaches that point . It's probably been said ( I will look at the other comments this evening ) , but the portrayals of Keir Dullea ( as Dave ) and Douglas Rain ( as Hal ) are absolutely SPELLBINDING . I do consider Mr . Rain's portrayal of " HAL " an acting performance ; consider , also , how much Mr . Dullea accomplishes without speaking . The Dullea / Rain struggle is probably my favorite part of the film , presently . This one is indispensable . 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( 1968 ) Stanley Kubrick - Keir Dullea , Douglas Rain , Gary Lockwood , William Sylvester
453276	15896852	20030	10.0	Ho-LA ! ( Douglas Fairbanks ' Greatest Adventure )	Musketeer par excellence Douglas Fairbanks ( as D'Artagnan ) is back , in this extraordinary sequel to his " The Three Musketeers " ( 1921 ) . After some years , Mr . Fairbanks ' main job becomes protecting the French King's good son . Unbeknownst to most everyone ( except the movie audience ) , the Prince and heir to the throne , William Bakewell ( as Prince Louis XIV ) , has an evil twin brother ; the identical twosome were separated-at-birth , in order to assure one King ascended to the throne , without incident . However , " good " Prince Bakewell is abducted , and locked up in " The Iron Mask " ; then , " bad " Prince Bakewell takes his place . Fairbanks and his musketeer pals must set things right . With its superb acting , brilliant pace , and stunning photography , this is the one Douglas Fairbanks film you must see , if you only see one . " The Iron Mask " is among the best films in the swashbuckler and silent film genres . It's also ( probably ) Fairbanks ' best performance as an actor . His quintessential performance , and film , might have been overlooked for " Academy Award " consideration due to Fairbanks being , at the time , President of the Academy . It was also apparent , to Fairbanks and others , that the popularity of talking pictures would soon silence the older style , despite the artful late 1920s silent film productions . " The Iron Mask " featured a spoken word introduction ( with Fairbanks in fine voice ) ; currently , it is the rarer version . As the Fairbanks ' introductory words invite viewers into the " shadows of the past " , of a different " age " , it's worth seeking out the original introduction . Another version featured Douglas Fairbanks Jr . ' s narration , replacing intertitles ; this version is interesting , to a point . Note , eventually , the " narration " version becomes distracting and obvious . Fairbanks , with director Allan Dwan and photographer Henry Sharp , came up with an ending so memorable it's been said to symbolize the approaching end of its star's career , and the end of silent films in general . They could hardly have had a more suitable ending . For Douglas Fairbanks and company , " The Iron Mask " was a perfect fit .
