385424	391152	277371	2.0	A very poor movie indeed	The film is supposed to make fun of lame teenage comedies like She's All That , American Pie , even back to The Breakfast Club ( although I kind of like that one ) . Why ? Those are comedies in the first place . If a comedy is unfunny , then what are the chances that its spoof will be funny ? There are maybe one or two small laughs in the proceedings . The opening scene , where the main character is caught playing with herself by first her father , then her brother , then her grandparents , and then her priest is pretty amusing , if foul . That's probably the least disgusting joke of the whole film ! The younger boys are pretty funny . Cody McMains , who plays the main character's little brother Mitch , looks like he might be Judd Nelson's son , especially in the homage to The Breakfast Club . The ' token black guy ' is pretty funny . When the characters all go to a party , he has to approach another black guy who has showed up first . ' Excuse me , I am the black guy in this movie . ' ' Oh , sorry , ' the other black guy replies , ' my mistake . ' Mr . T and Molly Ringwald appear in truly uninspired cameos ( do teenagers even know who they are ? ) . Melissa Joan Hart , the star of She's All That , appears , probably to inspire nostalgia from the uber-young audience . I'm just normal young , and I'll always think of her as Clarissa . .
384641	391152	300051	2.0	Terrible !	I've always liked Kevin Smith , if not a lot , but I never imagined he would sink so low . He completely co-opts his talents to make a romantic comedy so sickly sweet that I thought my eyes were going to stick in the back of my head . Ben Affleck gives a performance that should effectively torpedo what's left of his flagging career , and Liv Tyler , while cute as ever , makes you wish that Jennifer Lopez hadn't died in the film's first ten minutes . Smith uses every cheap rom-com convention in the book . He probably thinks he's doing a send-up of the genre , but nothing feels subversive . The little girl , Raquel Castro , is adorable , especially during the climactic music sequence . I don't think I cracked a smile more than once during the movie . The worst I've seen so far in 2004 . .
385759	391152	127349	2.0	One of the worst films of the past few years	I can't believe the amount of positive comments on this film . It is poorly directed , acted and written . It wants to be a love story , but the relationship is unbelievable . The characters themselves are inconsistent and live only in a script . The politics are pathetic - it's like the screenwriter heard some stuff about political activism in the late 60s and early 70s . The sex scenes are exploitative and downright embarrassing . The two lead actors , both great elsewhere , are pathetic here , especially Connely and her Southern accent . But you can't blame them . They didn't write down this awful and pretentious dialogue . I wish I could find a quotation , but the critics have wisely not quoted a single thing from the film in their reviews . Oh yeah , there's the thing about " I need you like I have a thousand monkeys on my back . " What the hell kind of romantic imagery is this ? If this is the kind of stuff you find touching , hey , you're a lost cause . I would give it a , but I'd feel guilty . You see , I didn't have the patience to finish it , but turned the VCR off instead after an hour . Wait , so is she a ghost or is she alive ? Who the hell cares ? .
384600	391152	70290	3.0	A really terrible movie	The story is good enough : two sailors are ordered to take a younger sailor from Virginia to New Hampshire to a brig . There he'll serve eight years for a ridiculously minor offence , trying to steal $40 from a charity box . On the way there , they try to show him a good times and have some adventures . But the style of the film seems very amateurish . The sound feels like Ashby really wanted to copy Robert Altman's revolutionary soundtracks , but it just doesn't work . The characters mutter all the time and often I couldn't understand what they were saying . Luckily , I rarely cared . The dialogue seems like it was improvised . Often the characters would stumble through lines , as if they weren't sure what to say next . Some of the dialogue resembles that of the Blair Witch Project : when the actors didn't know what else to say , they just swore . Well , I guess they are supposed to be sailors . Jack Nicholson has never been so obnoxious , nor ever as bad . I despised his character more than any other I can think of offhand . Otis Young has almost nothing to do in the film . Randy Quaid is pretty good , but , if indeed it was improvised , he has an easy job as an extremely shy and dumb fellow . I don't know what the hell Hal Ashby was thinking when he did this one . He's no master filmmaker , of course , but , in his own charming , sloppy way , he made two of my favorite films : Harold & Maude and Bound for Glory . .
384565	391152	66492	3.0	A movie based on a costume from 2001 that someone found in the garbage	Joan Crawford's infamously bad swan song , the story of an anthropologist ( Crawford ) who makes a study of a missing link , whom she dubs " Trog " ( short for " troglodyte " ) . The film is extremely cheap and cheesy . Hey , I like extremely cheap and cheesy . If it were only that , I probably would love the movie . But what makes the movie bad is its slow pace . People talk interminably about stupid things , and the boredom sets in and never leaves . The scenes where Trog and Crawford play ball are the very definition of camp , and I would have much preferred Trog's final rampage to last 80 % of the film's run . So , due to boredom , this truly is a terrible movie . It may be bad , but I still liked it more than Love Story , which was released the same year .
385750	391152	408839	3.0	Ugly and misogynistic . What happened to the Farrelly Brothers ?	It's way too bad about the Farrelly Brothers . It looked like they were going to be the great comedians of modern cinema after their first three films , Dumb & Dumber , Kingpin and There's Something about Mary , but all of their subsequent films have been disappointments . Me , Myself and Irene , Shallow Hal , Stuck on You and Fever Pitch were all decent movies , but none of them had the cojones of their first three . They seemed to be getting sweeter , which wouldn't be such a bad thing if they didn't also lose their edge . Well , their new film , The Heartbreak Kid , proves that their edge is completely dulled . Where they were able to combine a certain humanity with the gross-out jokes in a film like There's Something about Mary , it now feels like they are just desperately cramming them into The Heartbreak Kid . None of the dirty jokes work . They're all groan-inducing . Nothing seems more out of place than a Tijuana donkey show . The incongruity of it all isn't even what ruins the movie , unfortunately . It's the way they treat women , or at least one woman , Malin Akerman . Man , does this movie come off as misogynistic . I'm guessing that , in the original film , written by Neil Simon , there's more insight into how bad a person the protagonist is ( there played by Charles Grodin , here by the every day more dire Ben Stiller ) . It doesn't feel like there's much insight into Stiller's character , and I think we're actually supposed to like him and root for him to get into a relationship with the " good girl " , here played by Michelle Monaghan . In the end ( and especially in the end , given the final twist of the film ) , I hated the guy . Akerman comes off as nasty , but Stiller's character doesn't even deserve to get peed on by her .
385611	391152	780608	4.0	Lame	Lame pot comedy about a girl ( Anna Farris ) who gets high , eats a bunch of cupcakes which , unbeknownst to her , have pot in them , and then becomes really , really high . The movie follows her as she stumbles about , trying to acquire more pot and then to pay off her dealer . But , being high and all , she doesn't quite have the gumption to get where she's going . There are definitely some funny moments , but in general it's never more than mildly amusing . And Farris , I think , overplays it a bit . I'm not a pothead myself , but I don't think most potheads would even find much to like about the movie . For one thing , Farris does not end up winning in the end . The message is clearly that drugs can get you into trouble . And I don't think that's something the film's intended audience really wants to hear . A big step down from Araki's previous film , Mysterious Skin .
385210	391152	27672	5.0	I'd bet that I'm in the minority , but I just found this one a bore	A bust . As disinterested as I often am in Mizoguchi's films , Sisters of the Gion effectively knocked me unconscious . Some of the acting seemed decent , as did some of the direction . The opening shots were great . But then it slows down to a crawl that I just couldn't withstand . This is the first of his films that I was just not able to take . The couple of Mizoguchi films that I really like are Life of Oharu and Sansho the Bailiff ( and Ugetsu's pretty good , as well ) , so if you haven't seen those ones , do so . .
385602	391152	32155	5.0	My least favorite Ford film	Sad to say , but this was the first John Ford movie that I did not like ( and I've seen more than 20 ) . This is the story of Abraham Lincoln's first trial as a defense attorney , working on behalf of two young men who were accosted by a deputy brandishing a pistol . Henry Fonda does not give one of his better performances as Lincoln . He seems uncomfortable , and looks particularly terrible in his make-up . Of the other actors in the film , the only two worth mentioning are Donald Meek , who plays the prosecuting attorney , and Ward Bond , the victim's best friend and a witness to the crime . The prologue to the film is corny , as is a lot of the rest of the film . I'm not a fan of courtroom dramas , and this aspect of Young Mr . Lincoln is one of the worst examples of that genre that I can think of . People often criticize Ford for injecting ill-fitting humor into his pictures , but I was never bothered by anything like that until this film . Lincoln is constantly cracking jokes , and the jury and audience are always laughing uproariously at them . The only scene I thought was really successful was the one where Lincoln stops the lynch mob . That dialogue is very good . Otherwise , I was very disappointed in this one . .
385598	391152	37630	5.0	Not Bresson	Disappointing on a couple of major fronts , as a Bresson film and as a Cocteau script . This was Bresson's second film . Five years later , he made the first film in his signature style , Diary of a Country Priest . Dames is much more conventional in its style and content . A society woman tricks her former lover into falling in love and marrying a former cabaret dancer ( a Hollywood-like front for prostitution ) . The film is pretty , but dull as Hell . Elina Labourdette , who plays Agnes the dancer , is excellent ( and she sure can dance ) , but the rest of the cast is lifeless . I can't believe Jean Cocteau worked on this script . For curiosity's sake only . .
385021	391152	62185	5.0	Weak film for everyone involved	Mostly reminiscent of Suddenly Last Summer , which was made eight years earlier . With the loosening of the Hayes Code , Huston is able to imply a lot more than Mankiewicz could , but , just like the earlier film , in the end it feels like little more than a freakshow , with little insight into the situation or characters . I was hugely disappointed in it . I also found it nearly impossible to pay attention to . It moves slowly and is very poorly paced . Except for some of the racier material that wouldn't have flied just a few years earlier , it's really hard to believe that this was made in 1967 . The film-making feels so creaky and old-fashioned compared to other American films released the same year , like Bonnie & Clyde , Cool Hand Luke and In Cold Blood . I'm not overly familiar with John Huston's filmography , but with a film like Moby Dick it felt like he was the director most responsible for modernity in American cinema . I didn't much care for the performances either . Elizabeth Taylor delivered the performance of her life the previous year with Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? , and this feels like a reversion to a more classical , palatable Liz ( palatable in looks and style ; the character is a bitch , but it's nothing new ) . Nice to see that her Martha was just an act , though , which makes that performance even more impressive . I've actually been kind of sick of Brando for several years now . His Actors ' Studio style just gets on my nerves , and those habits are in full force in this film . His constant mumbling is so difficult to understand I had to turn on subtitles . The film's final shot is hilarious , though of course unintentionally . Maybe I'll give this another try down the road , but after one viewing I really didn't care for it .
385725	391152	345032	5.0	Mediocre weepy	The story of a man ( Kim Rossi Stuart ) reuniting with the disabled son ( Andrea Rossi ) whom he abandoned at birth . This was Italy's official entry for the Academy's Best Foreign Film award , which makes perfect sense : it's the same kind of clichéd , sentimental crap that usually takes home Oscar gold . By some miracle , the Academy skipped it over ( another story of disability , The Sea Inside , won that year ) . The Keys to the House pulls out just about every cliché imaginable . The most obnoxious is perhaps the fact that the boy's mother died in childbirth ? which is why the father has ignored him for 15 years . Like many films dealing with the disabled , it sees them mostly as objects to be dealt with . A woman whom the father befriends during the film ( played by Charlotte Rampling ) also has a disabled child , and at one point she admits that she wishes her daughter would die . The only difference between this movie and your standard American prestige picture is an overbearing score . There are a couple of decent scenes , but , for the most part , and I thank it for this , the film is instantly forgettable . Avoid .
384932	391152	462538	6.0	Meant more for casual fans than for diehards . Plus , the format just doesn't really work as a movie , I think .	I'm an absolute fanatic of The Simpsons and have been watching it since it was on Tracey Ullman . I grew up with it . I was the exact same age as Bart when the very first episode premiered . Unlike a lot of fans , I've never turned my back on the show . I am not one who thinks each new episode is worse than the last . I do acknowledge that it's long past its peak , but I think almost every new episode is funny enough to be worth seeing . Once in a while , they'll produce an episode that's genuinely fantastic . But , really , I don't demand fantastic . I'll settle for a few good laughs and be at least moderately happy . Now comes The Simpsons Movie , which had been talked about for the last 15 years , at least . Much like when I watch new episodes , I wasn't expecting the movie to be that great . Unfortunately , it fell below even those expectations . It has a few good jokes and moments ( the only time I laughed really loud was the Tom Hanks bit ) , but it doesn't do much right . Those who've long turned their backs on the show like to complain about recycled plot lines . It's true , of course , for pretty much every new episode , but the show has grown more manic and self-referential over time . Many don't like that , either , but I personally do like those kind of jokes . The movie just plods along with a predictable plot that's made up of some of the most basic of all Simpsons plots : Homer and Marge relationship problems , Lisa's environmental concerns , and Bart's loss of faith in his father . None of it here is done with the irony of the newer episodes . It's like it's part of the really early Simpsons , when we hadn't seen these plots a billion times . Except it completely lacks the perfect comic timing of the early seasons . In the end , the movie is only an occasionally amusing affair . Certainly it's worth seeing if you're a fan , but , unless you're the kind of nut I am , you can wait for the DVD .
384718	391152	112817	6.0	The long awaited reviewing of a movie I've often trashed	I'm only somewhat happy to say that it's nowhere near as bad as I remembered it ? I rated it a dismal after just one viewing . Since I first saw it , probably around a decade ago , I've educated myself in both Westerns and Jarmusch , and I can judge it better being more familiar with its referents . My judgment now : still not very good . To be fair , I can't say that I'm the biggest Jarmusch fan . I've seen most of his movies now , and the only one that works for me on any large level is his most recent , Broken Flowers . That film just blows me away . Other than that , I did like Mystery Train . All of the other films I've seen of his , which include Coffee and Cigarettes , Down by Law , Stranger Than Paradise and Dead Man itself , work for me up to a point . After that point , they just bug me . My specific complaint about Dead Man is that it seems to want to be profound , or at least people think it is ( the lead comment on IMDb right now begins : " A profoundly spiritual film speaking to our true human nature in a world of illusion " ) , but it also wants to be a goofy / weird comedy . That goofiness is fun at times , but definitely kills any apparent profundity . And , dammit , how can anyone take it the least bit seriously with that damn fat Indian ? I hate the character of Nobody , and hate Gary Farmer's performance . If it weren't for him , I think I'd like the film . I like a lot about it . First and foremost , the cinematography is outstanding . I also love the quirky costume design . And the supporting performances are fun . I personally don't think Jarmusch is trying to be profound at all . I think the goofiness was more of his intention . In that case , it would have been better if it had been trimmed a bit . This is his longest film , I think , and , even besides Nobody , it overstays its welcome . While I don't hate it anymore , this is certainly my least favorite of Jarmusch's films .
384956	391152	32258	6.0	Silly , but moderately entertaining	Though this film is found on DVD in a Bela Lugosi box set , Lugosi has a supporting role . Boris Karloff is also in it in a much more major role , but the star is character actor Stanley Ridges . The fact is , Karloff was supposed to be in the Ridges part and Lugosi in the Karloff part , but Karloff was considered unconvincing in the dual role . Ridges plays a college professor who is harmed during a gangland shooting . Also injured is a gang boss , Red Cannon . Cannon is dying , as is the English professor , so Boris Karloff transplants half of Cannon's brain into the prof's head , which helps him survive . Later on , the prof starts exhibiting memories of Red Cannon . Karloff attempts to use that subliminal knowledge to get hidden gangster money . Unfortunately , the subliminal soon becomes the conscious . It's a moderately entertaining story . The wrap-around story kind of ruins it ? the movie begins with Karloff about to be executed , and then the main thrust of the story is told in flashback . But when we get to why Karloff is about to be executed , it's just stupid .
385629	391152	70155	6.0	Decent filmmaking - morally reprehensible story	For quite a while , I really loved The Harder They Come . The music is fantastic . The cinematography and location shooting are gorgeous . And , most of all , I was simply fascinated by the Jamaican dialect of English exhibited in the film . A word of warning : this film is in English , but it is very difficult to understand , almost impossible at times . The Jamaicans accent their words completely differently , and their speech patterns have an entirely different cadence than ours do . And I liked the plot a lot for about half or more of the running time . I was genuinely involved with the characters and their stories . Unfortunately , after a certain point , it becomes very morally dubious . Yes , the main character , Ivan ( Jimmy Cliff ) , is not treated too fairly by Preacher . However , it's hard to root for a hero who stabs a man in the back because he confiscated his bicycle . It would be different if the audience were not asked to root for Ivan , but we plainly are . He thinks he'd make a great singer , but the producer of his record refuses to let the radio stations play it . After a while , Ivan is forced to make a living by selling ganja - which goes really well , obviously . When a police officer attempts to pull him over for speeding , he ices the copper . Then a bit later he kills three more , and basically goes on a killing spree . All of a sudden , people want desperately to hear his record on the radio . The producer'll make tons of money , so he lets it have airtime . Instantaneously , Ivan becomes a star and a Robin Hood-esque hero to the supposedly oppressed people of Jamaica . Well , Robin Hood isn't the best example - he's much more O . J . - esque ; is there anyone in the world who won't immediately conjure up the image of a white Bronco during a scene in which a dozen people cheer Ivan on when he's blasting away at a rival ganja dealer ? This is really dispicable , and it becomes even moreso when , during Ivan's final stand-off , the director , Brecht-style , cuts to the movie's Jamaican audience clapping and laughing as he kills a couple of more police officers . .
385706	391152	349710	6.0	Yeah , Firefighters are great , but . . .	I don't think dramas about firefighters work . There's just too much tendency to heroize them . They probably deserve it , of course , but uncomplex , two-dimensional heroes are no fun to watch . The story follows the firefighting career of Joaquin Phoenix . We see him get in quite a pickle , and he flashes back to his first days on the crew as well as the meeting and the courting of his girlfriend / wife ( the gorgeous ? but somewhat uninteresting ? Jacinda Barrett ) . John Travolta plays the chief . The movie fades from memory as soon as the credits appear ( the ultra-cheesy " Wow , aren't firefighters grand ! " montage that ends the picture sees to that ) .
384867	391152	348150	6.0	Not terrible , but certainly forgettable	Fairly entertaining , but entirely unmemorable . Superman returns from exploring the wastes of his home planet , Krypton , to learn that Lois has a kid and a live-in boyfriend . Meanwhile , Lex Luthor has been released from prison and has invaded the Fortress of Solitude in order to steal Kryptonian technology . The plot from there more or less writes itself . Too bad it also doesn't edit itself , as the film lasts over two and a half hours . The cast is mostly generic . Brandon Routh seems weak , but that's probably not his fault . The screenwriters have written little for him to do . Kate Bosworth is pretty but doesn't strike me as the Lois Lane type . Only Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor gives anything close to a good performance . He pales in comparison to Gene Hackman , but he has some very good moments . I absolutely hate that little moppet who plays Lois ' kid . He's in desperate need of a haircut . The action sequences are mostly enjoyable , although they cross far into the territory of ridiculous . I read an article shortly before the release of the film that said the film pays closer attention to science than previous Superman movies . Perhaps ? the climactic sequence of the ' 78 Superman is one of the most ludicrous moments in cinema history . But the first action sequence , in which Superman saves a doomed plane and no one , given real world physics , would have survived , is nearly as bad .
384865	391152	365485	6.0	The kind of film that I really wanted to like more , but just didn't	A good premise , a pretty good script , good performances , and fairly entertaining ? but for some reason The Matador just doesn't add up to much . A businessman ( Greg Kinnear ) , down on his luck , meets a lonely and mysterious man ( Pierce Brosnan ) in a bar in Mexico City . The two become friends and during an outing at a bullfight , Brosnan reveals that he is a professional hit-man . It takes a while for Kinnear to believe him , but even after he is convinced the two remain friends . They part ways , though , on a sour note . Several months later , Kinnear and his wife ( Hope Davis ) find Brosnan at their door looking for help . The film aims for low key , and I have a lot of respect for that . It's kind of neat to see a movie about a hit-man ( and bullfighting ) with absolutely no on-screen violence whatsoever . And I like the way it depicts two men becoming friends . I like the light comedy . Somehow , I don't really like the movie . I do have some affection for The Matador , but not much enthusiasm .
384807	391152	452637	6.0	Quite likely the most original American film of 2006	With that and the excellent performance given by Paul Giamatti , I have to have at least a bit of affection for the film , which is otherwise kind of a mess . Not to mention very silly . Giamatti plays an apartment building superintendent who discovers a strange woman living in the bottom of their swimming pool . She is apparently some kind of water nymph who is being hunted by a grass-furred wolf . If she can get past the beast , a giant eagle will lift her into the sky and bring her home . Hopefully the three giant twig monkeys , along with the uniquely purposeful residents of the apartment complex , can guard her from the grass wolf monster . Seriously . Oh , and the director , M . Night Shyamalan , plays a man who , in the near future , will publish a book that will , Wyld Stallyns style , bring about world peace . And there's a film critic character , played by Bob Balaban , who is ruthlessly ridiculed in the script . I think the thing , as ambitious as it is , could have worked with a few more script revisions . I swear there must have been some important exposition missing near the beginning of the film . And the nymph character , played by Bryce Dallas Howard , is awful . As The Onion put it , she comes off like she's the product of a drunken one night stand between Darryl Hannah in Splash and ET . I do want to rewatch it someday , as I was quite tired when I saw it . If it is as sloppy as it seemed , I think it'll be due for a remake in a decade or two , possibly even by M . Night himself , if they'll let him work after this debacle , as many have dubbed it .
384619	391152	74710	6.0	A fairly disappointing picture from Ray	It starts out well enough , with a recent college graduate ( Pradip Mukherjee ) desperate for work . The montage of his looking for work is great , especially a scene where he is interviewed for a job and asked the most irrelevant questions imaginable , including " How much does the moon weigh ? " He looks at the interviewer in disbelief . " What does that have to do with the job ? " " I'll ask the questions here , son ! " After several months of unemployment , he runs into an old friend who sets him up as a " middleman , " where he can make a huge profit with very little effort . It's immoral , and Mukherjee can feel his soul slipping away . But he can't quit , because he doesn't want to disappoint his elderly father ( Satya Bandyopadhyay , who gives the film's best performance ) . The main problem with the movie is that it's just too talky , and no one's talking about anything interesting . It wouldn't work if the characters were talking out loud about the moral dilemma ; that would make the film too obvious . But they just talk endlessly about how they are going to go about their business and so forth . The movie just drags on forever , and then it throws in this utterly contrived ending . Well , I was almost happy for the contrivance , because , although false , at least it didn't involve endless prattle . It's quite overlong . I miss the economy of his better films . A dud by a master . .
385101	391152	990404	6.0	Bahrani doesn't impress me much	I remember finding Ramin Bahrani's first film , Man Push Cart , a fairly good debut , but one that lacked any real depth . He hasn't grown much in his sophomore feature , Chop Shop . It also focuses on the urban immigrant poor . The main characters of this film are homeless Hispanic orphans , Ale and his teen sister Izzy . Ale is employed at a junkyard , and he gets his sister a job with his boss's wife . The two plan to save their money to buy a food delivery truck , on which Ale has been told he can get a good deal . The film has one conflict that gives it a little energy , when Ale learns that his sister is working nights as a prostitute . It's at its strongest when it's concentrating on Ale's anger and confusion . He begins to act out by committing crimes , which get progressively more serious . The film doesn't have a lot going on , but with this plot point giving the film a mild psychological complexity , it's a decent watch . Unfortunately , the film craps out at the end with a lame , forced plot twist that so ridiculously echoes the one at the end of Man Push Cart that Bahrani should be embarrassed to have went with it . And that final shot is pseudo-poetic trash . Well , it impresses Roger Ebert , anyway .
384863	391152	370032	6.0	Hardly terrible . It might qualify as stupid fun if it were just a tad more fun .	I should begin by saying that I am overly forgiving toward films of the sci-fi genre . I generally enjoy even the worst sci-fi flicks . According to most , Ultraviolet is one of the worst ( current IMDb rating : 3 . 7 ) , but I didn't think it was that bad at all . Not good , either . Just rather mediocre . If you're looking for a big dumb action movie , you could do a lot worse . For much of the film's run , Ultraviolet ( Milla Jovovich ) runs around slicing people up with little in the way of plot ( what there is is fairly confusing ) . Yeah , the action sequences are laughable , and they do get repetitive , but they're enjoyable in a stupid way . It's only when the film decides to act as if it had a human level that it gets really weak . None of the drama works , mostly because it's difficult to understand what has already happened and what is presently happening . Plus , the action up to a certain point moves at breakneck speed , so it's pretty dumb to slow things down so the characters can actually speak to each other . Less speakie , more killie ! Perhaps the movie's worse flaw is a difficult-to-follow climactic sequence . Like most bad sci-fi films , Ultraviolet's main draw is the visual design . However bad everything else might be , the movie looks awesome . It's mostly done with computers , like Sky Captain and Sin City . Some of the movie plays as if you were watching your friend enjoy a ( fun ) video game . Not especially recommended , but it's better than people have said .
384554	391152	94606	6.0	Unsatisfied with this acclaimed drama	Strange , unsatisfying drama with a tinge of quirky comedy . I don't know , it didn't do too much for me . At first , I was infuriated . It felt forced and the dialogue felt so utterly written . It almost felt like the actors were reading the book out loud . I half expected Kathleen Turner to end some of her sentences with " she said " . It does have an interesting message , one that everyone needs to take to heart , that it's very easy to get addicted to routines and never change your life , even when it might be much better to change it . I started to warm to it after a while , but I never crossed the line into liking it . There was one aspect about it that I really liked , though : the musical score by John Williams . Very subtle , not overused . Everything we generally wouldn't expect from John Williams .
385453	391152	835787	6.0	Hong seems to be making the same film again and again	Hong Sang-Soo reminds me a lot of Eric Rohmer , which seems to be a comparison many have made before . But I would definitely rank him quite below Rohmer . I've seen four films by Hong now . I liked the first one I saw , Woman Is the Future of Man , a lot , but the other two , besides the one about which I'm currently writing , I only barely recall . Woman on the Beach seems far too similar to Woman Is the Future of Man for me to like it a lot . I didn't hate it , by any means , though I did eventually grow tired of it . I liked the initial conflict , where a man brings along a woman whom he thinks of as his girlfriend on a trip with a film director friend of his . The director is kind of a jerk , and the girl is immediately attracted to him ? either that , or she is so bothered by the meek guy that she just wants to spurn him . Later on , she discovers that the director's jerkiness is a pretty clear character trait . Well , duh . Much as I remember from Woman Is the Future of Man , Hong's major insight seems to be that men ( particularly film directors ) are jerks , and that women like jerks , but also think they can change them . It's a pretty trite observation , really , and , in the end , kind of hateful toward both sexes . It doesn't help that the woman becomes a completely jealous shrew . If I'm remembering correctly , I liked the woman of Woman Is the Future of Man much better . She seemed , in the end , better and stronger than the men in her life .
384948	391152	427327	7.0	The young cast really makes this movie	I famously predicted that this movie would bomb in the theater , but I was incredibly wrong . It's actually one of the top-grossing films of the year . When I was fumbling for an excuse as to why it was so successful , I guessed that the film's Disney Channel alumni had brought in a younger audience and recaptured them for repeat business . Well , I think I happened to be right on that account . The film itself isn't anything special . It's quite enjoyable overall , but it doesn't break any artistic ground as compared to John Waters ' original flick . It subtracts some of Waters ' best moments ( my favorite loss being the scene where the characters meet up with Pia Zadora as a beatnik ) , and adds a worthless subplot just so Edna and Wilbur Turnblad can share a duet . It's not even funny how bad John Travolta is in this movie . They might as well have filmed him peeing on Divine's grave . He cannot produce a plausible woman's voice whatsoever , and when he sings it's ten times as grating . I don't even think Travolta was this bad in Battlefield Earth . Christopher Walken brings nothing into his role , which , as far as I remember , has been expanded far too much from the original film . Queen Latifah also brings almost nothing to the picture , except a decent singing voice . Too bad there's hardly a memorable song in the entire musical . I should mention that among the adult cast , James Marsden and especially Michelle Pfeiffer are quite good . So there , I've trashed it as much as I'm going to . There are some things I really didn't care for in the film , but , I must say , the film's young cast , to which I attribute its enormous success , makes it well worth watching . They're all fantastic , without a stinker among them . Nikki Blonsky , Amanda Bynes , Zac Efron , Elijah Kelley , Taylor Parks , and Brittany Snow are all outstanding . They are the equals , if not the betters of the original film's cast . They make the movie , really .
384570	391152	405159	7.0	Probably wouldn't crack my top 50 of 2004	I don't understand all the praise . Sure , it's a pretty good movie , but it's flat , obvious , and not at all memorable . Eastwood's last film , Mystic River , was ten times better . Hilary Swank plays a boxer who persists in trying to get trainer Clint Eastwood to make her his student . He finally does accept her , especially after his friend , Morgan Freeman , who works as a janitor in his gym , convinces him of her talent . Most of the movie is a pretty straightforward boxing drama . Swank and Eastwood become each other's surrogate father and daughter , both making up for lost loved ones ( Swank's father is dead , and Eastwood's daughter refuses to talk to him ) . The final act adds a tearjerker . There is also a poorly developed subplot about a few of the regulars at Eastwood's gym . It's slow , but mostly entertaining . Swank is good , but nowhere near the level that she hit with Boys Don't Cry . It's impossible to believe that Eastwood got nominated , especially over Paul Giamatti for Sideways . His direction is fine , but he can barely speak . Plus , he's so old it looks like his skeleton is trying to escape from his body . Morgan Freeman isn't especially great in his supporting role . He can't speak clearly , either . He narrates the film , and it can often be very hard to understand him . Million Dollar Baby is worth seeing , but it certainly isn't award-worthy . .
385359	391152	851578	7.0	Brief review	Trippy Japanese animé that mixes dreams with reality . You never really know what's going to come next in this picture . It's very entertaining , but only up to a point . It never establishes its own reality , so the constant surrealism does grow tiring after a while . And the characters are thin . A movie with such fantastic imagery shouldn't be as easily forgotten as this one is , and if I cared more about the story and the characters , that wouldn't be the case . I love the drawings themselves , but the animation is choppy , certainly much more so than a Ghibli film . My only other experience with Satoshi Kon is Tokyo Godfathers , and I do prefer Paprika to that for sure . It is quite fun . Certainly worth renting , if not going to the theater .
385112	391152	420609	7.0	Good , even if it pales in comparison to Capote ; it wouldn't have been popular even if Capote never had existed	This film had the unfortunate luck to open only slightly after a film about the exact same subject appeared and won a bunch of awards , but , honestly , it would have been overlooked in any case . It's notable for some of the acting , and mostly because actor Toby Jones is a dead ringer for Truman Capote , but it doesn't dig deep into the complexity of the situation or the characters . McGrath also makes a myriad of bad choices throughout . The interviews with people who knew Capote , first and foremost , feel very pedestrian . It allows McGrath to tell us everything we need to know , instead of showing us . It ends up feeling like we've just heard the story , instead of being able to experience it . It's also a little too jokey in its manner . I especially hated the jaunty musical score that played over every " Truman has fun in New York Society " scene , even up until the end . The film also speculates that Capote did have sex with murderer Perry Smith , which is very unlikely and unhelpful to the story . I also think , though most of the cast is quite good , Daniel Craig is miscast . I suppose it's a prejudice that can't be helped after seeing him in Casino Royale , but he doesn't work as Perry Smith the way Robert Blake or Clifton Collins Jr . did . Craig just comes off as too powerful . He's not very good at suggesting Smith's vulnerability . He's always the scary version of Perry . I don't think there's a single scene between Smith and Capote where Smith doesn't freak out at him . Especially embarrassing and cheesy : that song that Perry sings played over his execution . McGrath should be smacked for that ! The 2005 film Capote really looks good compared to this ( it was my favorite of last year's Best Picture nominees ) .
385757	391152	457572	7.0	Great idea , so-so results	In a 1950's style America , humanity has survived the zombie apocalypse , which happened much as it did in Romero's Night of the Living Dead , and is now living safe inside fenced-in safe zones . There is an invention , a collar of some sort , that is able to quell the zombies ' hunger for human flesh . Now they are used as servants , or , in some cases , pets . Fido is the Lassie of zombies . He even belongs to a boy named Timmy . Unfortunately , as tame as the zombies are , the collars don't always work so well . Timmy and Fido get into trouble when the collar gets turned off , and zombie mayhem begins . The concept is gold , but I don't think co-writer / director Andrew Currie produces anything that interesting . His film-making is often sloppy . It sometimes feels like he spent all his budget on some vintage autos and an unnecessary helicopter shot . The zombie makeup looks terrible , which is always distracting . And the zombie actors are generally awful , probably on account of Currie's direction . They all seem too expressive in their faces and eyes . There are a lot of interesting aspects of this post-apocalyptic society , but the world and its rules are never adequately explained . To boot , it's difficult to understand some of the backstories , especially that of the father ( played by Dylan Baker ) . I'd still give a slight recommendation , just because the idea is so fantastic . And it's an amusing picture , even if it disappoints .
385148	391152	65492	7.0	Robert Altman proves to be no Maestro	Robert Altman is undoubtedly one of the best American directors of all time , but he very often missteps . Remember Popeye ? Well , Brewster McCloud , his first effort post-MASH , his enormous hit and Oscar winner , shouldn't really be considered a misstep , per se . It certainly is an interesting film . It's just that Altman never knows when to stop , and by the end , I couldn't wait for it to end . The first hour is hilarious . It's original , even for Altman it is unique . But after about an hour , there's this fifteen or so minute car chase that's just lame . There have been hundreds of car chases in film history , and only about three have been exciting , all three of those being in the Mad Max series . This one goes on and on . I can give it one complement , or insult , however you might see it . It predicts The Dukes of Hazzard . Several cop cars chase around an orange muscle car . This car chase kills whatever mood has been growing . Also , the film is just too dang clever for its own good . Cleverness is a good thing in the movies , because you see so little of it . But when a film is trying to be so different that it just becomes silly , well , like I said above , you just have to know when to stop . Altman ends with what seems to be an ode to Fellini's 8 . During that circus , the reason that the audience's emotions are so high is because you know and love the characters who are dancing around . Here , they're all just caricatures . I shouldn't be so hard on it . To tell you the truth , I liked it for a very long time . The film itself took too many missteps , and ended much more poorly than it had began .
385179	391152	46004	7.0	Fun but slight	A cute premise stretched rather thin . A 7 year-old boy is tricked by his 12 year-old brother into thinking he accidentally shot him . The kid is so upset he runs away , taking with him six dollars the boys ' mother left behind for them . He goes to Coney Island and spends two whole days there . It's all nice and charming , but it might have worked better as a thirty minute episode of a TV series , or even at an hour . At 80 minutes , it gets repetitive and loses much of its potential charm . Shots are even reused several times . Richie Andrusco as the 7 year-old and Richard Brewster as his older brother are excellent child stars . They are far more natural than any counterpart in a Hollywood film of this time period . It's funny the way things change . That prank with the gun would surely have seemed very cruel in 1953 . But with that kind of event being an everyday 10 o'clock news item , it's much more tainted right now . And it's funny that , when I first saw Jack the Pony Ride Man , I didn't think of him as a concerned adult but as a potential child molester ! .
384790	391152	98596	7.0	A great story told in a rather dull fashion	Philippe Noiret plays a military bureaucrat who is meticulously trying to catalogue the casualties of WWI . He and two women cross paths during the excavation of a train that was buried in a tunnel by German explosives . This would make for a great existential movie , but it's all talk talk talk . The dialogue is endless , and , with the long running time , the whole picture seems that way , too . The film would be much more powerful if it demonstrated its themes more visually . Instead , the emotions come off as somewhat flatter than they deserve to be . The production is also poor ; it feels like it was made for television . And the musical score is so weak it takes the film down a peg itself . It's still worth watching , but I think it really could have been a lot better .
385118	391152	269217	7.0	Too much romantic melodrama makes it drag , but it's worth seeing for the good parts	Harvey Weinstein famously used to buy up foreign films and then would refuse to distribute them to American theaters , thus reducing competition in the arthouses for the films he actually decided to release . Tears of the Black Tiger was one of those films . Now Magnolia Films got it away from him and has it available . It's a Thai Western , with some of the weirdest and wildest production design to be seen . Unfortunately , it doesn't live up to that amazing trailer that played the art-house circuit back in January . While it certainly is a lot of fun in parts , the pacing is poor and the story gets so bogged down in romantic melodrama that at times it's downright boring . Still , those fun parts make it worth sitting through . When the Sergio Leone-esquire violence begins , it's always entertaining . And it has a couple of the best movie deaths ever .
385968	391152	98663	7.0	I love The Wizard . It's so bad .	Yes , this is the infamous 100 minute long Nintendo commercial , climaxing with the reveal of Super Mario Bros . 3 , which was released a couple of months afterward . It also has time to fit in commercials for Hostess deserts and Universal Studios theme park . Yet , for a commercial , it's not half bad . I admit , I like it 99 % based on misplaced nostalgia ( I was 10 when the movie was released ) . Not only was it about Nintendo , it starred Fred Savage ! I seriously didn't even remember Christian Slater was in it , nor Beau Bridges ( who is terrible pretending he knows how to play Nintendo , flailing at the buttons as he does ) . And the girl who co-stars is Jenny Lewis , now one of today's greatest musicians , heading the band Rilo Kiley as well as having a fantastic solo career . I would never have recognized her . The story's not that bad . As far as feature length commercials go , it's quite a bit better than Mac & Me . youtube . com / watch ? v = Ya0F83Bmbl4 .
385158	391152	435625	7.0	Scary ? Yes . Original ? Not by a long shot .	I'm tempted to rate this higher than I'm going to because it's so rare that a horror movie is genuinely scary . When it's at its best , The Descent is extremely blood-curdling . Don't read any further if you don't want spoilers ( though they are light spoilers , they are nonetheless spoilers ) . It also avoids effectively my pet peeve in horror movies : the women characters ( and the major characters in this film are all women ) don't fight back like wusses . Most women in thrillers and horror movies whack their enemy on the head once and then run away . These ladies know that if they don't give it their all , they'll be dead . So , anyway , it's a horror movie that's scary and not stupid . What's not to love ? My problem was that writer / director Mashall goes out of his way to hit every cliché in the book . It may be effective , but it's far from original . A lot of the film is just Aliens , and that final shock is total J-horror . Most of the scares are achieved by the cheap " boo " tactic . The film is much more effective when it isn't deafening us with musical stings . The entire prologue feels extraneous , and there isn't even a pay-off that involves it . The film really should have just started with the six women meeting at the cabin the night before the spelunking . They would have lost 20 minutes , but that resulting 80 minute horror film would have been better . The characters in general are pretty weak . They aren't as bad as your run-of-the-mill horror flick , but they aren't that much better , either . Still , it works and it's well worth seeing . Definitely see it in the dark if you do .
385531	391152	234837	7.0	Good act one , but . . .	Suzhou River's beginning represents an extremely compelling film . It has it all - a great narrative , great acting , great score , and it is emotionally involving . But the director / screenwriter throws it all away when he decides simply to revert back to Sir Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo . Vertigo is one of those films that is impossible to top , so it is just a waste of time to try . Here is my experience during Suzhou River , after having enjoyed the first 30 minutes or so immensely : I hear the score sampling Bernard Herrmann's Vertiginous theme , and see the camera quoting the film , and my mind immediately jumped back on my dreamlike memories of Vertigo . It's as if Suzhou River disappeared . Near the end , the film started to become a little more original , and my daydreams faded , but I was pretty lost at that point . Don't get me wrong . Suzhou River is still a fine film . I would actually like someone to remake most of it , taking out the Vertigo homage and inserting something more original .
384755	391152	60424	7.0	Passable Billy Wilder comedy ; the first pairing of the Jack Lemmon-Walter Matthau team	I'm not a huge Billy Wilder fan . I love Some Like it Hot , but was never too impressed with Double Indemnity and I really disliked Stalag 17 . I'm rather ambivalent towards The Fortune Cookie . I laughed a bit , but was also bored some of the time . It actually kind of lacks successful jokes . Walter Matthau , who won a deserved Oscar ( thought probably a sympathy Oscar , since he had a heart attack during the making of the film ) , plays the crooked lawyer who plans to milk an insurance company after his brother-in-law , Lemmon , a cameraman for the Cleveland Browns , is run down by a football player . Most of the best jokes are Matthau's . He has a lot of energy in the role and has a lot of great one liners as well as extended speeches . Jack Lemmon himself is good but had many better roles in his career ( look no further than to Some Like it Hot ) . He is still in love with his ex-wife who ran away with someone who promised her a singing career . She comes back to take care of Lemmon , but she's clearly a gold-digger . Ron Rich plays the football player who knocked Lemmon down . He's a little stiff , and , really , could they have found a whiter black man on Earth ? Much of the film's dramatics rely on his situation . He feels guilty for the injury , and Lemmon feels guilty for faking the injury and thus damaging the player's own confidence . These dramatic pulls never work well , though , since Rich is not all that good . There're also a lot of racial issues that are raised matter-of-factly - this was made at the height of the civil rights movement - and the casting of Ron Rich , who is so wimpy , sensitive , soft-voiced and light-skinned , is rather disingenuous . Still , at least the film is trying to show a friendship building between Rich and Lemmon . The film loses further pith because of the story . It's nothing special and it becomes , through the film's course , excessively predictable . Billy Wilder's direction is decent , but ordinary . The cinematography is pretty good and crisp black and white , but it may have seemed better in color . Really , all of my attention was focused on Matthau and Lemmon . .
385579	391152	60486	7.0	Very difficult , with limited rewards ; possibly better upon repeat viewings	Possibly the most confusing movie I've ever sat through , it took me a long time to get anything out of it . I just couldn't grab onto even the slightest shred of a plot , and , without the ability to find a hook , it felt at first like watching a blank wall . But eventually , I started making inroads and , as the film progresses , its chopped-up plot begins to emerge . It is the story of a rapist and murderer and two women with whom he is intricately involved . Shino is one of his rape victims , and also , we find out , a woman he rescued from suicide in the past . Jinbo is the killer's wife , who knows his guilt ( or at least suspects it ) but loves him and wants to protect him . Nagisa Oshima actually went to film school in France , and , though part of the Japanese New Wave , no one will miss the French New Wave influences , especially Alain Resnais , whose films have similarly infuriated me in the past with their difficult narratives . Even if I never understood what the hell happened here , the film has several great aspects . The acting is quite good , that's clear . But , in particular , the music , by Hikaru Hayashi , and the cinematography , by Akira Takada , are extremely beautiful . I think I might like this one better if I give it yet another try .
384980	391152	230600	7.0	A good way to spend an evening .	SPOILERSThis has potential to be as big a hit as The Sixth Sense on account of its nature - it is clearly trying to copy its success and its formula ( not to mention its release date - I think they both opened in the exact same week , two years apart ) . It is nowhere as good as that film , but , if you did like that , you're going to probably like this . I doubt anyone will like this one better , though . Technically , the film is superb . In this aspect , it probably surpasses The Sixth Sense . The editing and especially the cinematography are often breathtaking . The acting is decent . I don't particularly care for Nicole Kidman - she harmed Eyes Wide Shut significantly , in my opinion , but her bizarre style of acting worked fabulously in the purposely campy Moulin Rouge . Here , as a constantly paranoid , possessive , and protective mother , she is more than adequate , though not deserving of any award or special hurrah . The three servants are well played by Fionnula Flanagan , Eric Sykes , and Elaine Cassidy - they have a certain air about them . The best performances come from the two children ( another echo of The Sixth Sense , although the adults in that one were also marvelous ) - James Bentley as the perpetually frightened Nicholas and Alakina Mann as the intelligent Anne . Mann is in fact wonderful and I hope to see her in other films in the future . There are just a few actors after these principals , and I commend the filmmakers very much . This saves a ton of money , and makes the film more intimate and frightening , which is exactly what this film calls for . Like always , almost all of the film's problems exist in the script . The screenwriter ( who is also the director ) realizes that his savvy audience will guess that this is a descendent of the immensely popular The Sixth Sense , so he is always attempting to trick us . What are these strange servants up to ? A few times , we experience the narrative from their point of view , and what they say drives us wild with guessing . And what is wrong with the father , who had disappeared in WWII ( this is set in the 1940s ) and then mysteriously reappears in a frightening fog ? We know that there are surprises , and these tricks work to confuse us and lead us away - good old McGuffins . I guessed right away , correctly , the father's situation , which kept me from seeing the forest for the trees . What the script forgets to do , or at least forgets to do well , is develop the characters . The children are well developed , but Amenabar relies too much on the inherent creepiness of the three servants for their effect - they almost become silly by the end ; anyway , there were several moments when I laughed at their actions , although it might have been intentional . Grace ( Nicole Kidman ) is Amenabar's biggest failure . Her main character trait is a severe neurosis - her husband has been lost in battle and she has been left alone in an enormous mansion with only her two children . Those children have a severe light sensitivity - they break out in hives when they come into contact with light ( no , they aren't Gremlins or magwies ) . For most of the film , Kidman's character is built up , but the revelations at the end don't ring true . One of the reasons that the ending of The Sixth Sense worked so well was because the final revelations revealed a lot of hidden facets about the characters and their actions in the events which happened beforehand . The revelations here , while very unexpected and clever , don't exactly follow what Amenabar was building . Amenabar also has a problem with suspense . He gives himself all these little peculiarities to deal with - the kids are allergic to light , for instance . But he never really uses that to create suspense . One morning , the children wake up to find that all the curtains in the house have been stolen . It would have been better , perhaps , if we were allowed to watch the curtains being slowly removed at night . The suspense nearer the beginning , when we don't know very much , is quite good . The first set piece is excellent . A lot of the other scary scenes are also quite good , including the climactic one , where the secrets are finally revealed . Still , the film uses too many stingers ( sharp rises in the music ) . That may make us jump , but for a dishonest reason .
385402	391152	78481	7.0	A disaster	But not without a great deal of interest , especially for Altman fans like myself . It's actually one of the most disappointing films I've ever seen . I caught the first hour about a year ago on television , and I was enthralled . " One of Altman's best ! " I exclaimed . Or at least I thought that it probably would be if I ever got to see the last half of it . Now I finally found it , and I am hurt . The first hour is brilliant . It's the kind of film Altman is best known for , the ensemble piece , this one about a wedding . Perfect , Altman has two huge families to play around with . There are dozens of characters , perhaps more than he had in his masterpiece , Nashville . It's amazing , the family dynamics , the characters ' histories , their feelings about the union between Dino and Muffin , etc . It's all staggering , entertaining , hilarious , and brilliant . The first hour buzzes along like fireworks . But then it begins to trip . You can actually see it coming . There are just too many characters and too much going on . Most of them had had their moments up to that point , but some , such as Ms . Farmer , who seems to be somewhat important , we don't know anything about . However , to make it even worse , Altman and the other screenwriters begin to add more characters ( what's with Briggs and Tina ? They're just a horribly cheap plot device , and the two actors are awful ! ) , come up with more plot twists , and insert a sort of very miscalculated humor ( especially with the drunk aunt or whatever she was , the one dressed like a gypsy ) . It's like watching a train wreck for almost the whole of the second half . A few good scenes turn up , but far more bad ones . For instance , what the hell was Altman thinking when ( SPOILERS , although the film itself is its ultimate SPOILER ) he had Geraldine Chaplin come unto Muffin ? I mean , for God's sake , the film had like 20 minutes left . That just came out of left field . Its parallel is even less believable , although at least that one has some precedent character development in the film . Both of these scenes are exploitative . END SPOILERSAlthough it is a disaster , A Wedding does contain enough to make it well worth seeing once . Mia Farrow is really good . And if you ever wanted to see her naked ( she is quite a beauty , I admit ) , here's your chance . That scene was awful and should not have been in the film . It's another moment that just made me sigh with anger . This may be Geraldine Chaplin's best role . Although Nashville is in my personal Top Ten , I have to admit that the only part of that film that strains the film is the character of Opal , the ditzy , pseudo-BBC reporter played by Chaplin . In A Wedding , she plays the wedding planner , and she is amazing . It's far too bad Altman took a dump on her character by adding that penultimate scene of hers that I mention above in the spoiler . At least he kind of made amends by giving her the excellent final shot of the film .
385508	391152	74626	7.0	Terribly beautiful - terribly pretentious	It's impossible to love this film , and it is as impossible to hate it . The plot is slight and silly , and the dialogue and acting are unintentionally hilarious . Heart of Glass could stand as the archetype of the so-called " pretentious European cinema , " you know , the kind you would have seen Mike Meyers make fun of in his " Sprockets " sketches on SNL . In fact , I don't know of anything that comes even close to Heart of Glass in its pretentions . The film is as shallow as could be . Perhaps those with overactive imaginations could " figure it out , " but I don't want to waste that time . However , Herzog is an amazingly skilled director . The script may suck , but the visuals , the cinematography and the mise-en-scene , represent some of the greatest moments in all cinema . It's not a non-stop beauty festival , but there are many individual scenes of outrageous splendor . If only Herzog had planned the script as intricately as he searched out locations for the shoot . What this film really reminds me of an Andrei Tarkovsky or Michelangelo Antonioni film with no substance whatsoever . I can't give Heart of Glass more than a , but , in many ways , it's a must see . If you've never seen a Herzog film before , though , avoid this one . Start with Aguirre the Wrath of God or , my favorite so far , Fitzcarraldo .
385820	391152	154683	7.0	Interesting , but I wish it were better	The kind of film that sounds really exciting , and is interesting , but you wish it were a bit better than it is . Its reputation is based mostly on the final 40 minutes , where all the characters take a vacation to the bowels of Buddhist Hell ( pretty much like Christian Hell , but with more lotus flowers ) . The first hour or so isn't much less hellish . A college student and his wicked friend mow down a drunk gangster in their car . The student , burdened with guilt ( somewhat nonsensical guilt seeing as it wasn't his fault ) , starts seeing tragedy occur all around him . In just the next several days , all kinds of people with whom he associates die . It's never his fault , per se , but for some reason he always blames himself . That first hour is a little boring and a little confusing ? I was wondering if the guy was supposed to already be in hell . The hell part is pretty cool , but also fairly silly . What always works in Jigoku is the cinematography and art direction . This is a damn cool looking movie . I wouldn't particularly recommend it , but it's worth seeing just for the cool parts .
385033	391152	912592	8.0	An average documentary that excels because of an interesting subject	Not a particularly well done documentary ? the director doesn't get good enough footage to assemble a " complete " documentary , and it feels a little sloppy in the end . But Bar-Lev , whose second feature documentary this is , was lucky enough to chance upon an controversy that engages the audience nicely . I've certainly been thinking about it a lot for the past couple of days . The film is about a four year-old artist , Marla Olmstead , who took the art world by storm in 2005 with her amazingly sophisticated and beautiful abstract paintings . Marla's output produced a good $200 , 000 between ' 05 and ' 06 . Bar-Lev wanted to document this child prodigy , but in the middle of his time spent with the family , the infotainment show , just one of a host of television news shows that covered the story , broke the angle that Marla's father , an amateur painter himself , may have coached the girl . All Hell breaks loose , the parents become pariahs , and they look to Bar-Lev as a possible savior . Unfortunately for them , Bar-Lev , who all the time has been trying and failing to get film of Marla painting one of her " masterpieces " , is swayed by . It's a lot of fun to look at the evidence provided , to try to read the body language of the parents and try to read between the lines with them . You also have the issue about whether Marla herself was being exploited , which can raise a lot of debate . The film also works as an exploration of modern and abstract art . I myself am a fan of it , and I think there have been plenty of truly beautiful works of non-representational art . But , yeah , there are definitely paintings , some on display at an art auction going for millions of dollars in this film , where even I think the title of the documentary puts it perfectly . Most people are far less accepting than I . The film shows just how much the genre sticks in the craw of the general American public , and , in a sequence where the parents share a host of nasty e-mails with Bar-Lev , many seem just as angry that any of these paintings sold in the first place as they do that the paintings may be a sham . Even the segment angles itself as an attack on non-representational art . Also featured are clips of a John Stossel news documentary about abstract art that I remember seeing a while back that really got my goat and has literally been making me angry for years now . Like many documentaries , the film benefits greatly from its DVD extras , which include a 30 + minute followup ( which actually caused me to lose some sympathy for the parents ; I seemed to be one of the few people who watched this movie and sympathized with them ) , and a great 15 + minute defense of abstract art by New York Times art critic Michael Kimmelman .
384835	391152	400525	8.0	Underrated noir / crime caper with a comic edge	John Cusack stars , and his performance is pretty much what you expect from him : quick-witted and cynical . But , as far as I'm concerned , as long as that's what the role calls for , he's always good . He plays a mob lawyer who has just stolen over $2 million from his boss ( Randy Quaid ) with the help of a strip club owner ( Billy Bob Thornton ) . For a good ways into the picture , I thought I was seeing one of the best films of last year . It does start to stumble after about the halfway point , but it still finishes pretty strong . All the actors are strong , but I have to give special kudos to Oliver Platt , who is always a delight . He plays a drunk friend of Cusack's who is now miserably married to Cusack's ex-wife . I don't normally praise drunk acts , but Platt is particularly believable ? and hilarious . This movie is a lot of fun and well worth seeing .
385930	391152	23694	8.0	AS YOU WISH , MASTER	Bela Lugosi plays an evil plantation owner in Haiti who knows how to utilize black magic , like voodoo dolls and zombies . Madge Bellamy plays the woman whom Lugosi turns into a zombie , and is quite stunning in her white wedding dress and her enormous eyes ; she could have been ( possibly was ? ) a great silent movie starlette . Basically , White Zombie is a beautiful horror film that moves too slowly at times and kind of lame by the end , but the majority of it is very interesting . The direction and acting are above average , as well as the cinematography - possibly the best of any classic horror film I've seen . See it if you get a chance . .
385051	391152	468492	8.0	Should have cut back on the non-monster stuff , but otherwise excellent	It's been a long time since they made a really good monster movie , one that's lean and fun and scary . Maybe it's just because I saw it for the first time in a while last week ( and on the big screen no less ) , but Spielberg's Jaws strikes me as just about the perfect film of that sort . Much of The Host seems like it could come pretty close to Jaws . Unfortunately , while it is fun and scary , it can't in any way be called lean . When The Host is focusing on the monster , or the people hunting the monster , it's just plain awesome . The monster is original , cool-looking , scary , and it acts like an animal . Bong Joon-Ho's direction in these sequences is very close to being as good as Spielberg's . The one big complaint I would have with the monster is that there is little suspense built up to the revelation ? there's a backstory ( that frankly should have been scrapped , for both time and utter stupidity , not to mention pointless anti-Americanism ? even if it is arguably a joke ) , but only a couple of minutes into the main story it appears and starts wreaking havoc . But , my lord , that scene where the monster is running up and down the park chasing people is one of the all-time great sequences of horror . It made me giddy , while I gritted my teeth at the same time . The big problem with the film is that , whenever it wanders away from the monster , it gets fairly weak . I liked some of the quirky family comedy ( the plot is basically as follows : a father is after his daughter , who was eaten by the beast but later regurgitated alive ; with him are his own father , his brother and his sister , but they are hunted by the government who thinks they're diseased ) , but there are too many scenes where the four adult family members are standing around shouting at each other or at the bureaucratic doctors who keep them imprisoned . It gets incredibly obnoxious at times . In short , it's reminiscent of Little Miss Sunshine in its worst moments ( they even ride around in a van together ) . The worst part of the film is the whole satire / criticism of South Korean government , law-enforcement , bureaucracy , and the big-bad Americans , who are of course behind the whole thing . Much like Bong's last film , Memories of a Murder , figures of authority are nothing but idiotic goofballs who want nothing more than to screw the common man over . Where the cops in Memories of a Murder miss out on solving the case , the people whom you'd think would be trying to get the monster don't even seem to be looking for him . After all , it'd be easy to find , as the four heroes of the pic find it numerous times using very simple logic . Instead , they are more worried about quarantining everyone who came in contact with the beast the first time it appeared , without any proof , or even reason to believe they might be infected with anything . After the heroes escape from the quarantine , they have a fight with the monster , which several military guys with machine guns witness . But they only pull out their guns after the monster leaves . Maybe Bong was hinting at some Alien-like plot line , but he never attempts to give us any idea what anybody is thinking about the situation outside the family members . Another sequence has the younger brother escape from about fifty cops after they get locked behind a glass door and some huge glass widows , which any of them could have kicked through . There's also this whole thing with " Agent Yellow " , a noxious gas that's supposed to kill the virus or something , and people are protesting it , but Bong never lets the audience into what that's all about . I say , if you're going to keep us in the dark , just drop it all together . There's just so much Bong could have cut back on . I realize he wanted to make it more than just a monster movie , but unfortunately he isn't nearly as talented in other departments as he is in that one . Whatever my complaints , though , I did enjoy the film and it's easily the best 2007 release I've seen so far . P . S . I hadn't had a chance to read up on the film before I wrote this review , so I completely missed that the prologue was based on a true story . Read the IMDb trivia section for further details . Of course that means I am wrong in some of my sentiments above , but I'll let my review stand as my initial reaction .
385904	391152	18033	8.0	A decent romantic comedy made wonderful by the presence of Clara Bow	I'm completely smitten with Clara Bow . After having seen Wings , and having just watched It and the TCM documentary Clara Bow : Discovering the It Girl , I have to say that she's just about the most amazing actress of the silent era . Even besides her limitless beauty , it seems like she can accomplish anything with her face . It's far too bad that she was never given a role that fully suited her immense talent . Wings is the closest she ever came to making a great film , it would seem , but , even though she steals the movie away from the other actors , the dogfights and action sequences steal the movie from her . So then It has to stand as her testament , the film that best demonstrates her legacy . And because of this , it's not surprising that Bow is all but forgotten . I mean , It certainly isn't a bad movie . It's a moderately well done romantic comedy where the shopgirl goes after her rich boss . It's fun and entertaining , but not necessarily something you'll remember for that long afterwords . Much like any romantic comedy that would be released today , among which the best is only an average movie . But then those looking to observe Clara Bow's talent don't exactly need another movie . Bow effortlessly raises the level of the project . It would have been rather average without her , but she makes it good . Quite good , in fact . I couldn't take my eyes off her , and I know that I'll visit the film again because of her . The other actors are mostly forgettable , except for William Austin . He plays the boss's best friend , and he's pretty obviously a homosexual . It's one of the more open depictions I've seen . He's quite funny , as well , and it's no mean feat that he wins any attention whatsoever away from Ms . Bow . .
385823	391152	64866	8.0	In loving memory of Gillo Pontecorvo , who died last week	Pontecorvo's followup to The Battle of Algiers , and probably his second most famous film . That's probably mostly because of the film's star , Marlon Brando , but the movie itself is quite good . It's a little slow , sometimes a little difficult to follow , and it hits us with no less than three third act speeches ( a speech a character makes near the end of the picture which more or less explains the film's themes , just in case you missed it ) . At it's best , though , Burn ! is a powerful treatise on the pains caused by colonialism . The story centers on a British man , Brando , who goes to the Portuguese-run island of Queimada in order to provoke a slave rebellion . He preaches freedom to the slaves , but his real aim is to get control over the island's sugar . A decade or so after the original rebellion , the natives aren't co-operating with the British anymore , and Brando returns to overthrow their leader ( Evaristo Márquez ) , whose career he fostered . Brando is , as expected , excellent . I wouldn't rank this among his very best performances ( the inevitable Italian dubbing always makes all performances a tad awkward ) , but it's definitely second tier Brando . This might be the most despicable character he ever got to play . I also liked Márquez , who often gets criticized for giving a wooden performance . The cinematography is beautiful , and Ennio Morricone provides an amazing score ( I love the song that plays after the revolution ) . Gillo Pontecorvo's direction is very good . In fact , I think I slightly prefer this to his acknowledged ( in my opinion , overrated ) masterpiece , The Battle of Algiers .
385955	391152	1093842	8.0	Maddin's Winnipeg	Guy Maddin's ninth feature is a pseudo-documentary about the director's hometown of Winnipeg . It mostly focuses on his relationship with the city , but it also includes re-enactments of his family life and famous weird things that happened in the city's past . It's a bit of a mess , but , as I've said before regarding Maddin , his films play out like dreams . A mess makes sense a lot of the time . I do think the film lacks the focus of his best work , and is , in fact , my least favorite of his features . Also contributing to my relatively low opinion of it ( i . e . , I don't think it's one of the best movies ever ) is Maddin's own narration . I loved his previous film , The Brand Upon the Brain ! , but objected to the narration . It's even worse here , taking a lot of the mystique out of the silent film pastiche Maddin has been perfecting since The Heart of the World ( I'm kind of hoping that he'll some day return to the stuff of his earlier works , which felt more like the films of the ' 30s than those of the ' 20s ) . My favorite sequences were the occult ceremony in the Masonic temple and the hockey legends game , where septuagenarians play one last game as their stadium is demolished by wrecking balls . Darcy Fehr of Cowards Bend the Knee returns as Guy Maddin , who , in the movie , is as desperate to leave his depressing hometown as he is to stay ( throughout the movie , Fehr appears dozing in a train car that never seems to get out of Winnipeg ) . And Maddin dug up Detour's Ann Savage , possibly literally , to play his mom .
384535	391152	47444	8.0	This review is for at least the first two films of the Samurai Trilogy , and for the third installment unless my opinion of that is different	The Samurai Trilogy is a very good work , very well worth watching . No , they aren't as great as Kurosawa's samurai masterpieces , The Seven Samurai , Yojimbo , or Sanjuro , but they are no much less worthy . My only major complaint is that they were filmed in color , which is a lot less good looking and elegant than the black and white of the Kurosawa films . In some scenes , especially those at night , it is very difficult to determine which character is which . The Samurai Trilogy excels in several aspects . First and foremost , Toshiro Mifune may be the single best actor who ever lived . Sure , he was typecast , but he was great in his roles . There is a huge difference in his acting jobs in these films and Rashomon or The Seven Samurai or Yojimbo and Sanjuro . His character here is very complex . The second reason to watch is for the great secondary characters . They are all quite complex . There will be characters you'll love and long for , and other characters whom you will hope will be killed by Toshiro . These secondary characters are extraordinarily complex at times . Third , watch it for the novelistic unfoldings of the story . Well , it should be novelistic , since all three films were based on a single novel . Don't worry about the three movies repeating in any way . Also , it is a good idea to watch all three in a row ( I watched the first two tonight , and plan to watch the third one tomorrow night ; hey , it's late ! ) . The story is constantly developing , and you don't want to forget anything . I give each segment of the samurai trilogy a solid ( unless the third installment is particularly great or awful ; i will most likely post a comment for that film by itself ) .
385687	391152	110074	8.0	Flawed , but too charming not to like a lot	The Coen Brothers ' fifth film . It's well liked today , but was a disaster when it opened , grossing less than $3 million domestic on a budget of around $25 million . It also didn't do that well critically . It's not hard to see why . It's a film of all style and no substance . It's often easy to get lost in its labyrinthine production design and forget about the rather forgettable characters . Not to mention that it has the most forehead-slapping deus ex machina outside of Greek tragedy . Oh how I wish the Coens and co-writer Sam Raimi would have re-read the script one last time and realized how poor that whole climactic sequence really was . The characters may not be as interesting as they are in any of their other films , but they deserve better than that . Despite its massive flaws , I must say that The Hudsucker Proxy is so extremely enjoyable that it's pretty close to impossible to dislike . I for one enjoy getting lost in the art deco New York City the Coens have created . And there's something magical in the clockwork way the film runs , the mechanical dialogue and editing . It's strange , and it's not always successful , but it's so wholly original that I have a lot of affection for the picture .
385722	391152	106452	8.0	Third best version ( though I haven't seen the new one yet ) , but still undervalued	The third version of Jack Finney's novel is actually quite good , too . It sets the action in a military base , where a man from the EPA and his family have just arrived to do some tests . The protagonist of the film is the man's teenage daughter ( played by the luminous Gabrielle Anwar ) . There's little set-up in this version . When it begins , the pods have already started to spread . This speeds up the proceedings . I might even complain that things happen too fast . The film is more action oriented ? which is especially proved in its hilarious final sequence . Let's just say that , unlike the other versions , which take place in urban areas , they have lots of big weapons at a military base . Despite this , the film is quite effective as horror . A lot of scenes are recycled , always intelligently , from the previous two films ( love the take on the " I didn't tell you my name ! " scene from the ' 78 version , as well as " You can fool them . " ) . They also come up with some really good new ones , like the day care sequence , where the 6 year-old son of the EPA investigator figures out that something's going on . The direction in general is gorgeous . Some of the performances are a bit weak . I especially didn't care for Billy Wirth , the hero , who may be incredibly handsome , but he's handsome in a way that says : " I am a New Kids on the Block reject ! " Recognizable faces include Forest Whitaker and R . Lee Ermey ( who tends to pop up whenever a film needs authentic military-type persons ) , as well as Meg Tilly , who has the film's most memorable line . Undervalued .
384836	391152	102138	8.0	Mostly great , with a few bad sequences that significantly harm the film	I'm not especially familiar with all aspects of the Kennedy assassination ( it was well before my time ) , but one thing's for sure : the Warren Commission's final word is more than a little incredible . I don't know how much of Oliver Stone's film is provable fact , how much of it is loony conjecture , or how much he just plain made up ( he says none , but others have denied that ) . What I do know is that the film , even though it runs at 3 and a half hours , is engaging , exciting , gripping and suspenseful . I'm not a big fan of movies that follow investigations , but it's great here . And I especially hate courtroom dramas , but the final sequences of the movie represent an extremely tight tour-de-force . The film is at its best when it's exploring the mystery , and , confoundingly , at its very worst when it takes time to develop its characters . There are two scenes particularly when Jim Garrison's wife ( played by Sissy Spacek at her very worst ) accosts him for not spending enough time with his family . I'm thinking , " HELLO ! Most important investigation in American history going on here ! " I think his kids would forgive him in the future for being a bit inattentive at the time . The second of these scenes , where Costner explains to his kids that he won't be leaving their mommy , almost had me throwing stuff at the screen it was so sappy . Kevin Costner isn't very interesting , and , besides , from what I've read Stone really softened the character of Jim Garrison , so any character development on that front is dishonest . Most of the best acting comes from the massive supporting cast , where almost anybody is liable to show up . I was quite happy when John Larroquette showed up , and even happier when Donald Sutherland appeared . And Brian Doyle Murray as Jack Ruby ? Awesome . My favorite performance by far was Kevin Bacon . I always feel bad for the guy , because he's spent such a long career acting in middling roles . He really is a fine actor , which he gets to prove every so often . He only has five or six minutes in this film , but he's great .
385514	391152	38160	8.0	Quite good , but I was expecting a little better	They Were Expendable opens on December 7th , 1941 and takes us through the opening of the Pacific leg of WWII ( from the point of view of the U . S . ) . Most of the film takes place in the Philippines . Most of the major characters are sailors on P . T . boats , which the navy doesn't believe are going to be very useful . The film is handsomely produced , with some of the best battle scenes of its time ( the boats take on destroyers and planes ) . The battles with the planes are spectacular and gripping . The film should be better than it is , but there are some major doldrums in its run . Unlike some of John Ford's better films , They Were Expendable is only sporadically great ; several individual scenes are beautiful . John Wayne is great in it ; it's definitely one of his best performances . Perhaps I might like it better if I watched it a second time ; I had a long break in the middle , and that can always harm films . .
385492	391152	205271	8.0	Solid work from Altman . A very good film indeed . ( and Andy Richter is thy God ) Contains Spoilers	I haven't read through the other comments yet to see why such a sharp animosity for Dr . T exists ( 19 % of voters gave it a 1 , the lowest score ) , but I really liked it . I am a Robert Altman lover myself , but have not been afraid to criticize his films in the past . I'm probably the only one who will say that I hated The Player . I felt it was a rather childish lash out at Hollywood . I also criticized greatly Short Cuts and Brewster McCloud ( although I ultimately gave them the thumbs up ) . But he has made at least one of the best films ever made , Nashville , a masterpiece through and through , and several other very good films , including MASH , McCabe and Mrs . Miller , and his previous film , Cookie's Fortune , which I would deem wonderful . Doctor T struck me as also very excellent , and I'm giving it an , which , in four-star criticism , equals a stars . First , before I discuss why I liked the film , I must point out its most glaring fault , the one which , I think , must sour the film for most of its viewers . This is the whole " Hestia Complex " deal to which Dr T's wife , played by Farrah Fawcett , becomes subjected . Obviously a made-up complex , it seemingly insults our intelligence . According to her psychiatrist , it is a complex which crops up when a woman is " loved too much . " When she has everything she could possibly want . It happens because " the mystery " of existence no longer exists . Thus , a woman with this complex reverts to a childlike state . This whole complex thing pops up within the film's first act , and , since we don't believe it , we just say , " Oh , that's so stupid . That could never happen . " And then we just block it out of our minds for the rest of the film . Whenever it crops up again , we just try to ignore it . Fawcett's acting skills make the whole thing seem even more stupid . This is not the right attitude to take . It is not stupid , per se , but what is truthful to say about it is that it is contrived . Contrivances are not a no-no when it comes to art . If you think they are , then you obviously don't remember Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliette , among others . You have to just accept the contrivances as much as you can , suspend your disbelief a little . This whole Hestia Complex thing is utterly important for your understanding of Dr . T . Now , onto the rest of the film . Another reason why , it seems to me , people would complain is the lack of a plot , or a conventionaly plot , anyway . These people would have to fully admit that they are completely unfamiliar with Robert Altman . Even if they are not , they still have a semi-legitimate complaint . The film's meaning takes a long , long time to reveal itself . One could easily get lost in the meantime , especially if that person has chosen to disregard the Hestia Complex portion of the film . I still don't see how it's all that different from films like Nashville and Brewster McCloud and Short Cuts . Nashville is a very difficult film , and , as Pauline Kael asks in her famous review of it , " What does it mean ? " Actually , I think I myself have figured that out ( and I'd be willing to share my views on it upon request ) . But for several of his other films , I have not . To tell you the truth , that is why I have always been so ambivalent towards Brewster McCloud and Short Cuts . I may have liked a lot of both of them , but , when it all comes down to it , I never really saw the point . However , I still enjoyed them . With Dr . T , I believe I did get the point . It's just that it isn't revealed until the film's climax , the wedding scene . By then , I'm sure a lot of viewers have already thrown up their hands . Yes , it is a long time to wait , but you just have to be patient sometimes . Altman is not interested in spoon-feeding us any answers . Okay , so here's my interpretation , so maybe you should skip this paragraph and the next if you want to figure it out for yourself or if you are just so angry that you don't give a care what some other idiot thinks it means : it's all about stability , to put it simply , the possession of it and its lack . To be stable may seem like a wonderful thing , but it can also get mighty boring . Dr . T appears to be a near-perfect human being . While it would have been simple to make a stupid comedy about a sexy male gynecologist ( see the Saturday Night Live sketch , Mel Gibson : World's Sexiest Gynecologist , to see how it could have turned out ) , this is just not done here . Women crowd to get into his office not because he is sexy , but because he is just so good to them all . He's warm , and he obviously cares for everyone around him , strangers included . The rich-and-unsatisfied wife is a stock character in drama . We don't ever see Dr . T's wife in that characterization , but she was obviously in that position . Dr . T's daughters , Connie and Dee Dee , appear at first to be pretty stable . They're a doctor's daughters and dress very beautifully . Dee Dee is a cheerleader , kind of a dream profession , but she's not very good . She's also about to get married , but she will regrettably have to abandon a more rewarding relationship to do so . To get married is , of course , the American symbol of stability and normalcy . Connie is in bundles , although she constantly asserts to her father , " Don't worry about me . I'm fine . " Hardly . She is constantly in knots over her sister's foolhearty decision and she obsesses about JFK's assassination ( the film takes place in Dallas ) . To boot , Dr . T's sister , Peggy , has arrived at his home , divorce pending , with her three daughters . Peggy is completely unstable ; she can hardly deal with her young daughters and she drinks like a fish . Dr . T also has an assistant , Carolyn , who constantly interrupts personal conversations and rest time with the pretext of anxious patients ; the truth is that she is lonely and secretly in love with her boss . Dr . T is being crowded by these and many other women in his life , and , like any doctor , relaxes on the golf course . There , he meets Bree , a woman pro golfer who has decided to relax a little herself . With all of his burdens , Dr . T immediately becomes involved with this source of stability , someone who is confident in her current decisions . All of this may seem like a mess to many , but it shouldn't be if you know a film like Nashville . As Altman likes to do , the climax takes place at a marvelous setpiece , Dee Dee's wedding . It is outside , and it's threatening to storm . A bundle of problems are arising , and , as it begins to pour , chaos ensues . Dr . T's experiences an epiphany : stability is overrated . Not everything can be perfect , so it is pointless to exhaust oneself trying to make it so . A similar theme runs through Cast Away of the same year . Dr . T embraces the chaos and jumps into a covertible . As he puts the top up , the wind rips it apart . He laughs and drives off in the rain towards Bree's apartment . He has chosen to convince her to run away with him . She wants no part in it . She is happy where she is , is stable . She knows that she cannot control her life perfectly , but she knows that she must exert some control . Hurt but not destroyed , Dr . T drives away . We don't know where he's going , and I doubt he does either . As he drives , a tornado descends upon him and sucks him away . This part probably angers a lot of viewers also because it is so random and untelegraphed . But I think it works . Fantastically , Dr . T survives the tornado , but has ended up in an isolated area of Mexico . The village nearby is isolated and in need of a doctor to deliver a baby . He does so . He is there to begin a new life . Again , he exists in a state of possible stability as the town doctor , but also there exists the possibility for random events , i . e . , the mystery .
385381	391152	97576	9.0	As good as the first two	The Last Crusade is the Indiana Jones film I've seen least . In fact , I may be lying if I were to say I've seen it more than once all the way through before this viewing . Having watched all three of the original trilogy last week , I have to say , there isn't a great gap between them in quality . They're all three excellent movies with brilliant direction by Spielberg , and pitch-perfect action sequences , paced just so as not to overwhelm the viewer . The Last Crusade is the most comic of the three films , adding Sean Connery as Indy's father and pairing the two as a kind of Abbot and Costello team . It's shocking just how well it works ? if I hadn't seen the movie and you told me Harrison Ford and Sean Connery would be the perfect comic duo , I'd have been more than a little dubious . Connery isn't known for his comic chops , but , if he didn't have them before , he definitely earned them here . I think , after James Bond ( and I'd say unfortunately so ) , his Henry Jones Sr . will prove to be his most remembered performance . Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies both return from Raiders , and both are more comic characters this time around ( Elliot in particular is hilarious ; I think Sallah is kind of wasted in this one ) . Alison Doody plays Indy's double-crossing love interest . I had remembered her as being particularly forgettable , but this time around I thought she was quite good . I still have to wonder what happened to Karen Allen ( which is kind of explained in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull ) , who was by far the best of the Indy girls , but Doody is good at what she does . River Phoenix appears in the brilliant opening sequence as young Indiana Jones . What a sad waste his death was .
385373	391152	95627	9.0	An excellent film	It begins with a scene without context , and then proceeds for a good quarter of an hour somewhat randomly , but then it pulls itself together and ends up being very good . Actually , I now have an inkling that , if I were to see it again , those opening 20 minutes or so would seem a lot better and the film would be nearly a masterpiece . Mestizo ( a word that I don't remember ever being defined , by the way ) is a Venezuelan film about the son of a wealthy , white man and a poor black woman whose people are fishermen . This boy is named Jose Ramon , and he lives in an extremely confusing society . He is brought up as a white man , though he is visibly mulatto . The aristocratic community , with whom his father is trying to assimilate him , does not entirely trust him . Later in the film , when he tries to live amongst the community of black fishermen , they trust him even less . SPOILERS : Eventually , Jose's boss , a judge , leads his wife , Gregorina , into sleeping with Jose , which arouses the judge . This is Jose's first sexual experience , and from that point on sex runs his life . He believes that he loves Gregorina , and he convinces her and three other white women , daughters and wives of rich , white men , to take a boat ride with him and another black man . The sequence in the boat , where the six of them play a game where they similize the moon convinced me that the film was very good ; it's a brilliantly edited sequence . Soon , Jose figures out that Gregorina and the other white women were only slumming . And because he took his relationship with her so far , his boss fires him . His father , who wants to mold him into a respectable aristocrat despite his African roots , verbally assaults him over the affair . Jose runs away to his mother , who also kicks him out of the fishing village when he allows the other fishermen to rip off his share of the profits . He does this , obviously , because he has never needed money . Now he does , and he won't take it . His mother is offended that her son is just a chump , and that he is treating the fisherman's life as only a game . With both of his potential homes off limits , he becomes a homeless man on the beach . It's an idyllic life , but he misses people , well , more specifically , sex with women . In the film's most amusing scene , he builds a woman out of sand . When the scene opens , you see Jose resting in the sun , but there's an odd lump of sand closer to the camera with some bits of driftwood or seaweed on top of it . Then Jose begins to caress the sand , and we realize that he has sculpted a woman ( we only see it from the hips down ) . He has used driftwood and seaweed as pubic hair ! He brushes his hand and fingers over the faux crotch , but he sharply pulls his hand off of it . The pubes fall off , and under them is a crippled tarantula , pushing itself along with its few working legs . It is a spectacular scene , lasting only a minute , if even that long . Eventually , he is convinced to come home ( by sex ) , and his father apologizes . He has planned to send Jose to Caracas ( I can't remember the name of their town ( maybe it's Mestizo ! ) , but it's a rather small fishing village ) to learn law . Before Jose leaves , he visits his mother , who also forgives him and wishes him good luck . As he stands on the ship to Caracas ( which is contrasted with the small fisherman's boat that he has used so often elsewhere in the film , including the preceding scene ) , his racial conflict has been solved : he is now a white man , in a white suit and smoking a cigar . He tips a black man for helping him . But the solution has rough edges : he begins to hear the sounds of the city in his head , and they disturb him greatly . We end with this notion . END SPOILER : The style and rhythm of the film is akin to French New Wave films , which means it's quite choppy . Some shots are on and off so quickly that they never have time to register , which is a problem a few times during the film . The acting is exquisite . Marcos Moreno plays Jose Ramon Vargas to perfection , and everyone else is as good . The direction , by Mario Handler , is quite good , especially during the boat ride I mentioned and the sex scenes that follow it . Perhaps someday others will have a chance to see it . I implore you to do so . I myself really want to see it once more , to see if the beginning was as bad as I perceived it to be . My guess is that the previous film that I had watched , the awful Natal da Portelo from Brazil , was still influencing my mind for the first 20 or 30 minutes of Mestizo , because I had a lot of the same criticisms . To think , I nearly left the theater ( it was a double feature ) after Natal da Portelo ended ! Thank God I was too lazy to get up off my butt ! I give it a .
385519	391152	28231	9.0	Underrated Hitchcock	The only thing generic about this British thriller is its title . After that , it's a rather remarkable and suspenseful Hitchcock movie . John Gielgud plays a WWI pilot who is hired by his government as a spy . He meets up with two operatives , one who is playing the part of his wife ( Madeleine Carroll ) and one who is just Peter Lorre . I'm not sure what his cover was ( perhaps this is just a small flaw ; I think that if these were real spies they wouldn't make it very far , but I think I'm mature enough to suspend my disbelief on this kind of thing ) . They are in Switzerland to root out a German spy . Robert Young plays an American tourist who has a thing for Carroll . The script is excellent , with some fine dialogue . The characters are well developed . Hitchcock's direction is super-taut . The acting is just great here , especially Peter Lorre , who is just delicious . One thing to note in this movie , as well as Hitch's other 1936 film , Sabotage , in my opinion one of his greatest achievements , is the weight that death carries . In most of his other films , the death of a human being is treated rather cynically . One need only view The Trouble with Harry , which displays Hitch's wildest cynicism . I don't particularly mind this normally , but it's interesting to see the moral implications explored more fully in Secret Agent and Sabotage . .
385498	391152	52735	9.0	excellent performances	It's unfortunate that this film is so little known . I caught chunks of it on television a few months ago and found the idea of a Satan worshiping Kirk Douglas a bit more than interesting . I didn't know the title , but came upon the film again in the tv listings . Since it also included Burt Lancaster and Laurence Olivier , I figured that I could only gain something by recording it . And I'm very glad I did . The film is a historic drama set during the American Revolution with a lot of comedy thrown in . These varying aspects mix quite well in the film for the most part , and , even when they don't , there're always those three great actors to save the proceedings . Lancaster plays an American priest who is hoping that his community takes no part in the rebellion . Douglas is the self-described devil worshiper and ne'er-do-well who is the community's most outspoken rebel . Olivier has a major supporting part as an English general . These three performances are impeccable . The dialogue is also so ( it's based on a G . B . Shaw play ) . SPOILERSThe script has a couple of large problems . The biggest is that the writers seem to have no clue how to treat the role of the priest's wife , Judith , well played by Janette Scott despite the script's flaws . I have a feeling that Hollywood conventions are getting in the way here . Judith reacts violently to the cynicism and cruelty of Douglas ' character , but , for some odd reason , the screenwriters have her fall in love with him . This is pure Hollywood hokum . Even at the film's end , the writers have not decided what to do with her character : the priest , now transformed into a militiaman ( he dresses like Davy Crockett ) , hands over his wife to the devil worshiper because of a heroic deed he has accomplished . His response to the priest is confusing . I think he refused the offer . Still , Olivier asks Douglas to join him for tea with Judith , to which Douglas agrees . Instead , Judith runs off with her original husband . It is very odd . The writers should have never pushed Judith into Douglas ' arms . One other scene is very hard to watch , too : the scene where Lancaster attempts to sabotage the British troops . It is well meant to show the priest's transformation , but they play it as an action sequence . It is quite poorly staged - one of those scenes where you are always wondering why that one British soldier doesn't kill the priest when he has the chance . Anyhow , it is pointless to complain . These inconsistencies and missteps don't harm the overall effect of the film . I watched this movie for its actors , and , boy , do they give awesome performances .
385081	391152	65233	9.0	I heard the title a long time ago . How can you forget it ?	This is one of the weirdest and most unique films I've ever seen . It's artsploitation , and like most artsploitation , its art is questionable . In the end , though , I judged that it was more art than exploitation . Others , and probably the majority , would probably feel the opposite . A shy young man follows a group of men who are dragging a woman up to his apartment building's roof . He watches quietly as they rape her . When she awakes in the morning , she asks him to kill her , for she's too unhappy to live . We discover that he himself is suicidal , and that he harbors a deep curiosity and fear around sex , which has lead him to murder before . It does cross the line several times , especially with a series of photos of Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate , among which is a picture of Tate's corpse , but there's a lot of interest to grab onto . If nothing else , the stark black and white cinematography is gorgeous , and director Wakamatsu's use of music is masterful . A trip some will definitely want to take , while others , and you probably know it already , should avoid . The director later went on to produce Oshima's In the Realm of the Senses , which , while certainly a good film , is far less daring and compelling as Go Go Second Time Virgin . .
384734	391152	35153	9.0	Marvelous	Made in the middle of WWII , One of Our Aircraft Is Missing is quite a great film . The technical aspects and special effects are extraordinary . The script is wonderful ( Oscar winning ) and the British RAF members are all well developed . Some of the Dutch could use a little more characterization , but it's not too bad . One might think that the Archers ' strengths lie in fantasy films , but they stick to realism here , and they do a great job . If you are a fan of the Archers , don't miss it . If you are a WWII buff , also make sure you catch it . .
384605	391152	61390	9.0	Beautiful peace of work	I had never seen this ten minute long Chuck Jones cartoon before . It's one of his very best . The colors are mindbending , as are the animation and drawings . I felt alternately robbed that I had never seen it before , and happy that I finally did get to see it !
385103	391152	870111	9.0	Excellent all around	Gripping account of Richard Nixon's first television interview after resigning from the Presidency . It was conducted by a man who was strictly an entertainer , Englishman David Frost , who believed it would be a great way to become famous in America . At the beginning , he has no real convictions , but the researchers he has hired ( Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell ) motivate him to attempt to give Nixon the conviction he never received from the American justice system . When the interviews begin , it turns out to be a David and Goliath story , with Frost unable to compete with Nixon . The strongest point of the film are the performances . Langella in particular hits a homerun , giving perhaps the best fictional performance of Richard Nixon yet in cinema . Much like in The Queen , which was also written by playwright Peter Morgan , Michael Sheen holds his own against a powerhouse performer . Also great are Kevin Bacon , playing Nixon's former Chief of Staff , now a defeated , hurt man desperately trying to redeem his boss , and Sam Rockwell , as Frost's most passionate researcher . Though based on a play , Frost / Nixon almost never betrays that origin . It's intimate , but open . I don't know how much you can credit director Ron Howard with the film's success ? I imagine that its success belongs more to the actors and Morgan ? but it is by quite a distance the best movie he's ever directed .
384825	391152	63415	9.0	Hilarious ! One of Peter Sellers ' best films ! .	The Party begins with a kind of lame parody of Gunga Din's final scene ( I guess you might consider it a SPOILER to Gunga Din , so consider that before you check this one out ) . Hrundi Bakshi ( Sellers ) is playing the main character of the new film production Son of Gunga Din , but he's little more than a series of accidents waiting to happen . He ends up ruining a set piece , which gets him fired . The producer of that film tells a studio exec to blacklist him . That exec accidentally adds Hrundi's name to the bottom of a party list . He goes , and , as you might expect , ends up destroying everything around him like a small tornado . Most of the film takes place at this party ( and the film only really gets funny when Hrundi gets to the party ) , where we meet various Hollywood phonies and stars who are full of themselves , as well as a few innocent newcomers being beckoned to the infamous casting couch . All these people react in different ways to Hrundi , but most like him and see him as a nice guy who probably doesn't belong there anyway . He becomes enraptured by a young French newcomer named Michelle ( Claudine Longet ) . Peter Sellers made a lot of films , and I have to admit that I haven't seen many . What I particularly like about The Party is the character of Hrundi and Sellers ' performance . Sellers ' films are usually very funny , but the characters are often just caricatures . I really like Hrundi . He could have easily been a gross stereotype . Sellers wears dark makeup to appear Indian , and he speaks in an accent . But Hrundi is not just a stereotype . He is a genuinely lovable person . He does some stupid things , but he always means well . I actually think the character would have been worth sequels . I am sure that Sellers and Blake Edwards were studying the French comedic filmmaker Jacques Tati when they were making this film . There are several scenes very , very reminiscent of M . Hulot's Holiday , Mon Oncle , and Playtime . Hrundi seems to be clearly based on M . Hulot . Of course , I am not accusing The Party of stealing or anything . I'm just happy that someone in Hollywood was a fan of Tati's films , and felt that his formulae would work in an American film . I wonder how well this film did financially . It's not well known at all today . One more note : my Lord , Claudine Longet may be the single cutest girl I've ever seen ! I don't know if I've seen her elsewhere . I can see why she didn't become a huge star . She's not imposing like others . Nor , truth be told , is she a great actress . But wowza ! I think my heart just stopped !
385074	391152	348121	9.0	Underrated	Hardly perfect , but this really did not deserve to be dismissed as thoroughly as it was . It's one of the most outstandingly awesome animated films ever made . The visuals are simply eye-popping , and the action and adventure are top notch . This film imagines an alternate route for science where steam is harnessed to its fullest extent , producing unimaginable energy . A small sphere works as some sort of super-engine , and several different groups are after it . A young boy in Manchester , England , Ray Steam , whose father and grandfather invented the sphere , must try to keep it out of the wrong hands . Unfortunately , he has no clue which hands are the wrong ones . Even his relatives might be using the power for the wrong reasons . The story isn't deep , but it's exciting . The main reason to watch is the animation , which mixes traditional and computer animation in fascinating ways . Katsuhiro Otomo , who directed the animé masterpiece Akira so many years ago , has had a small output over the years . He directed a live action film in 1991 known as World Apartment Horror . The only other animated work under his direction is the third part of the portmanteau film Memories , one of the most remarkable animated shorts ever , entitled Canon Fodder . He also wrote the screenplay and worked on the storyboards of Rintaro's Metropolis , of which Steamboy reminds me most . I think Metropolis is one of the best films of the 2000s so far , and Steamboy is only a step behind it .
385983	391152	39677	9.0	There are a couple of themes that don't seem entirely worked out , but it's an exceptional film	A startling and powerful film by the man who would direct The Third Man two years later , and a big spit in the face of anyone who has ever said he only made one great film . It's not quite as good as The Third Man , but it definitely nears its greatness . The visual style for The Third Man was being developed in this film , and perhaps earlier ( I'm very interested in seeing other films by Reed in the future , and have had The Fallen Idol , the film he made between Odd Man Out and The Third Man , on tape for a while now ) . There is a scene in this film which is close to identical to the scene in The Third Man where we see Harry Lime's gigantic shadow running across a wall . We don't quite have the quirky angles , but there are some odd shots that look like they are moving in that direction . Odd Man Out is the story of an IRA leader , Johnny McQueen ( James Mason ) who kills a man during a robbery , is injured shot by that man , and is then separated from his partners as they flee the scene . The story follows him through that night as he stumbles home , bloodied and dying . Various characters help or hinder , going through moral dilemmas as they make their decisions . It's generally very fascinating , and always very tense and entertaining . The one thing that causes me a major problem is the IRA connection . The organization's name is never mentioned ; in fact , it is referred to as ' The Organization ' . I suspect my problem is due solely to my own ignorance , but , from the little I know of the IRA , it's difficult for me to think positively of that organization . We know that Johnny wants to go about the organization's business nonviolently , or at least he has worries about violence or the possibility of violence . The whole movie seemed to skirt the whole issue of the IRA in a way , so it was difficult for me to completely care too much what happens to Johnny . My sympathies started moving towards the more colorful supporting cast . And the finale seemed to me little more than a romantic , semi-dodge of the issues of the film . The way Johnny is created in the screenplay also creates this problem . While he is coherent and thoughtful at the beginning of the film , he becomes weak and delirious immediately after he is shot . I am confused by the massive praise I've found for Mason concerning Odd Man Out ? he spends the majority of the film stumbling about , not saying anything . Yes , he has a soulful look on his mug , but this didn't impress me all that much and two minutes of Mason's Captain Nemo far outweighs this performance . He delivers a speech from the Bible late in the film , in what I would call the film's least successful scene , but its meaning in the film seemed obscure to me . The other actors , though , deserve nothing but my highest praise . Kathleen Ryan plays Johnny's girlfriend , Kathleen Sullivan , and she is a real soulful performer , much more impressive than Mason's sweaty , hangdog look ( he begins to look more and more like Edward G . Robinson as the film progresses ) . Her sadness and love are deeply felt . The supporting cast is so good , it would almost be a waste of space to write of all of them . Perhaps Peter Judge ( aka F . J . McCormick ) deserves special praise as Shell , a destitute man trying to make a little money out of Johnny's wretched situation , as well as Robert Newton , who has the most flamboyant role as a starving artist who wants to paint Mason as he is nearing death , because he feels that his soul is as expressive as any ever was in this state . .
385518	391152	27752	9.0	Another enormously touching Ozu film	Incredibly gentle and touching Ozu picture about a single mother who works her butt off to send her only son off to school . Many years later , we follow her journey to visit that son in Tokyo . He hasn't kept in contact very well . His mother doesn't even know about his wife and infant son , nor that he is a grade school teacher , a rather low ( and low-paid ) position . Simply put , he's embarrassed at the little he has accomplished and he thinks his mother will be gravely disappointed that she went to so much trouble to educate him . The whole situation really hit home , and I was deeply moved by it . The film also features incredible cinematography and editing .
385483	391152	78754	9.0	Self-congratulatory , but , without a doubt , brilliant	A brilliant movie from a brilliant artist , and you'll be reminded of that constantly as you sit through All That Jazz , both in positive and negative ways . This , Fosse's fourth and also penultimate film , is his version of 8 ½ . But the great success of Fellini's semi-autobiographical masterpiece , easily one of the five or ten best films ever made , is that its author depicts himself with the greatest humility . And not only great humility but , most importantly , honest humility ( or at least believable humility ) . Fellini's constant self-deprecation felt like honest self-criticism , and it felt as if he was truly exposing his inner self to his audience . In All That Jazz , Fosse tries to do the same , but the self-deprecation comes off almost as back-patting . Fosse presents his alter ego , Joe Gideon ( well played by Roy Scheider ) , as a lovable cad . Oh , he might bang every chick in sight , but it's very much applauded . I can complain about these more arrogant aspects of All That Jazz , but what is undeniable is how great a filmmaker Fosse really is . It may be extremely self-congratulatory , but , judging from this film itself and its three predecessors , it can be argued that Fosse deserved the adulation that he supplies himself . As a fan , I loved the way he incorporates semi-fictionalized versions of his previous films into this one . 1974's Lenny plays a major part , as Gideon is going through the process of editing his new film The Stand-Up throughout the film . He brings his daughter to its premier , and , it being her first R-rated movie , she thanks her dad and then asks him why that guy wanted to sleep with two women at the same time . The reference to Cabaret is less pronounced but clear , when , stemming off from the daughter's question about threesomes , Gideon flashes back briefly to himself recreating the " Two Ladies " number . This number , of course , was famously created for the film version of Cabaret by Fosse . I'm not 100 % sure if there is a reference to Sweet Charity ( which would make sense , since it bombed horribly and almost ruined Fosse's filmmaking career ) , but the musical number with Gideon's girlfriend and daughter begins sort of like the " If They Could See Me Now " number , with Shirley MacLaine in Ricardo Montelbahn's bedroom . The musical numbers are something to behold . I think this is a given in a Bob Fosse film , but every single one is breathtaking . The sexy rehearsal number , which leads into the even sexier " Airplane " number , would be pilfered by singer / choreographer Paula Abdul in her video " Cold Hearted Snake . " More silly trivia , John Lithgow was so goofy looking in his relative youth , that guy who was the captain of the Love Boat and also the dad in ALF has an important part , and Wallace Shawn , of Manhattan , My Dinner with André and The Princess Bride fame appears in the most poorly calculated scene in the movie ( Fosse wasn't scrutinizing his film enough if he left it in ) , has one line , and it is the worst line in the entire film . Damn , I wish I could remember it ! .
385556	391152	119823	9.0	A true gem , all the way	Just like when Jed Clampett was out shootin ' for some food , I thought that I'd watch this movie because I was hungry to see every single version of William Faulkner's fiction put to film . I expected possum stew , but , lo and behold , this was quite the bubblin ' crude . I mean , who would expect such a high quality movie to be made for television , a Hallmark Hall of Fame production , at that ? Well , the script was written by Horton Foote , most famous , I imagine , for his script for To Kill a Mockingbird . The original story is half of Faulkner's masterpiece If I Forget Thee , Jerusalem , which brilliantly alternates between the stories Old Man and The Wild Palms ( a name by which the novel has also been known ) . The Wild Palms is the better half of the novel , I think most people would agree . It's a tragedy about a woman who leaves her husband for a young man studying to become a doctor . The resulting scandal forces them to wander around the country , and the story ends with the gravest tragedy . Old Man , on the other hand , is a comedy . Where The Wild Palms presents a sickly and pained relationship , Old Man presents a parody of a marriage . A convict ( Arliss Howard ) is enlisted to help save people who are caught in the flood of 1927 , perhaps the largest the United States has ever seen ( it completely covered most of the South for miles on both sides of the Mississippi , and probably most other rivers , as well ) . He is specifically sent to rescue a young woman in a tree and a man stuck on top of the roof of a cotton house . Well , although he doesn't know how to control the boat , he does find the woman ( Jeanne Tripplehorn ) . He never finds the man on the cotton house roof , but he does find the woman in the tree , and she's eight and a half months pregnant . They get lost on the giant lake which was the South . Though the opportunity for escape , for a whole new life presents itself almost constantly , Howard refuses to take it . He's stubborn ; he only has nine more years to serve ( for a silly , attempted train robbery that barely got off the ground ) , and , dammit , he's gonna serve them no matter what . The movie consists of little more than muted conversations between the chattering woman and the convict of few words . A kind of love arises between them . This doesn't happen the same way in the original story . In fact , my sense was that the convict , who had been in jail since the tender age of 19 , had had no experience with women whatsoever and was downright afraid of both the woman and her baby , who is born in the first couple of days afloat . The comedy of this half of the novel is lessened and the work is made more dramatic . Without the tragedy of The Wild Palms , this actually works very well . The two lead performances are great . I would never expected this amount of depth from Tripplehorn , whose career has been middling at best . This proves her to be a viable actress . Arliss Howard , though I've seen him in a hundred movies , several of which are personal favorites , I do not recognize whatsoever . His performance in this film is nothing short of masterful , just magnificent .
384774	391152	829482	9.0	One I think that people will be watching over and over again	Hilarious and smart teen comedy , without a doubt one of the funniest of the year . Michael Cera and Jonah Hill play two high school seniors who are best friends . When invited to a cool chick's party , they try to get their über-geeky friend , played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse , to use his fake ID ( on which he is now infamously renamed " McLovin " ) to get them some alcohol . From there , everything goes awry . It's really a laugh-a-minute movie . The previews and commercials ruined a few of the best jokes , but there is no shortage of laughs anywhere in the movie . It also manages to be fairly touching , without devolving into schmaltz ( a problem that the film's producer Judd Apatow has yet to solve in his own films ) . The awkward dialogue is wonderfully convincing , and completely recalled high school for me . Very enjoyable , and one that I hope to enjoy very often in the future .
384892	391152	43081	9.0	A gem	When people ask the question " Why don't they make musicals anymore ? " I find that it is quite easily answered : " Well , the genre was perfected in classical Hollywood . " We can never get to that point again , and can only hope for re-invention , which we kind of got this past year with Moulin Rouge . However , that film cannot compare with the musicals of the 30s and 50s , nor can any other musical ( at least from what I've seen ) of the past 20 years . I had never heard of Two Weeks with Love , and only began to watch it because there was nothing else on when I sat down to eat my lunch . I missed the first 15 minutes or so , but the plot was simple enough to reconstruct : a family goes on vacation in the Catskills around the turn of the Twentieth Century , and the middle of three daughters ( Jane Powell ) , Patty , 17 in age , feels that she is becoming an adult . Her parents treat her like a child , though , and won't allow her to where a corset , the symbol of young womanhood . Another guest in their hotel is Demy , a Cuban gentleman played by none other than Ricardo Montalban ( how old is this guy ? this film was made in 1950 ! ) . He's a bit older than Patty , but she is extraordinarily attracted to him . Her older sister , Valerie , tries to trick her into screwing up when she's in front of him ( she wants him , too ) , and her younger sister , Melba , thinks Patty's a nut . Debbie Reynolds , cute as ever , plays Melba , two years before Singin ' in the Rain . This film has a lot of great musical numbers , but it can go a long time at some points without one . However , it's so entertaining even without the music that I was never impatiently waiting for the next one to occur . The humor is marvelous . The dialogue is very clever , and there are actually a lot of sexual innuendoes . Some of them may not have been meant . For instance , one scene has Patty explaining to Demy how she would cling to him if she fell into a lake . She wraps her arms tightly around this pole that looks far too much like a penis to suggest anything else . I hope someday that I'll be able to see the first 15 minutes that I missed . Perhaps then I'll give it a 10 , but for now I'll give it a .
385645	391152	57261	9.0	You really couldn't hope for a better film version of the novel	And saying that , I also should clarify that I've never seen more than a few minutes of the 1990 remake . I have read the novel , though . It is good , but its none-too-subtle parable make it sort of a weak read to an adult . I was 15 when I read it , and I thought it was obvious then . As far as the prose goes , it could have been written by an intelligent teenager . Peter Brooks , when adapting the novel into this film , decided to go with a cinema-verite style , obviously influenced by early French New Wave films like Breathless and The 400 Blows . What results is amazing : an immediate and believable telling of events . The amateur actors are excellent , and cast to perfection . The cinematography and editing make the film much more frightening than the novel was . All in all , the only real problem is the often inappropriate scoring , especially at the film's end . I give it a .
385139	391152	42593	9.0	Fantastic film with Bogart at his very best . Gloria Grahame also gives one of her best performances .	The story concerns a Hollywood screenwriter ( Bogart ) who is suspected of being a murderer . Grahame , a neighbor , steps in to defend him ? she saw the murdered woman leave his apartment alone . Afterwards , they begin a relationship . But Bogart's nature is a violent one , and that violence keeps pushing forward . It makes Grahame rethink her earlier testimony , as well as fear for her own safety . It's quite a unique film for the time , one that actually deals with the possibility of an abusive man . Everything is perfectly done , and the script is wonderful . The film's tagline was ' The Bogart suspense picture with a surprise ending ! ' What is surprising about the ending is just how much weight it carries . .
385795	391152	99902	9.0	Just a wrung below Raise the Red Lantern	In ten or twenty years , Zhang Yimou will be regarded as one of the greatest foreign directors . I think his film Raise the Red Lantern is one of the greatest films ever made , easily . Ju Dou is just one step below it . Its positive points are too numerous to mention in any great detail . Just let me warn you that , like almost every movie ever put on video , this film's video / DVD box lies horrendously about what you're about to experience . Ju Dou is not a passionate story of forbidden love . It is not Romeo and Juliette , and you're not going to desire to watch it every Valentine's Day . It is not erotic , but brutal . It is an utterly complex film which is consistently challenging . SPOILERS AHEADThe film starts off pretty conventionally with a mean old man purchasing a young wife in the hopes of producing a son with her . He spends several days beating her into submission . During this period , the old man's nephew , who is treated horribly by his uncle , begins to obsess over his new aunt's beauty . The aunt notices his obsession , and welcomes him as a sort of savior from the cruelty of her husband . We expect a plot where these two find a way to escape their common nemesis , or maybe even kill him . He seems like any other villain to us . The nephew and his aunt produce a child , which is passed off as the old man's . Soon after this , the old man is in an accident and is paralyzed below the waste . Now the young couple has their common tormentor at their mercy , and they use that to their full advantage with horrifying physical and mental torture . They almost instantly tell him that his son is actually the son of his nephew . They build him a tub with wheels ( the Chinese version of a wheelchair ) , and when he misbehaves , they suspend him from the ceiling . This behavior confuses us deeply . What would we do in a similar situation ? Maybe the same thing . But when we see it done , we cannot help but be horrified . Cruelty has begotten cruelty , and everything is spinning out of control . Meanwhile , the young child ages . He has not talked yet , and silently and painfully watches as his mother and cousin cavort , not hiding their lust in the least ( it does turn from passion to lust very quickly ) . The child does not feel that these two have any feelings for him , so he connects to the old man , whom he believes is his father . In fact , his first word comes when the old man is plotting to murder him : " Daddy , " spoken to the old man . The old man is ecstatic , not so much because his " son " has just spoken as because he knows the implications of the child knowing him as his father instead of his cousin . I won't go any further , but this film becomes more painful by the second . My complaints need to be voiced , too . They are few , but key . First , I think that the first half hour or so should have been fleshed out a bit . The relationships and even the characters could have stood to be more developed earlier on . I do not like how Yimou uses slow motion in this film . It does not feel right . My final complaint is with the very end of the film . It is a bit of a cop out , to end the story by burning the house down . I think the only problem in Raise the Red Lantern was also the very end , where Gong Li's character just goes insane . I think it is better to know that the character exists and will have to live with his / her mistakes forever . That is much more powerful , and a better ending . Anyhow , this film is a .
384748	391152	209144	9.0	Truly , utterly brilliant	I had grave doubts going into this one . Its fans seemed to me to be the same people who like a lot of the movies I really hated over the past five years or so , movies like The Matrix , Run Lola Run , Fight Club , and many others . I avoided it for a long time , though I always thought I had to see it no matter what . And when the chance to see it for free came along , I jumped at it . Fortunately , Memento lives up to the hype . It's one of the few movies that can . Seriously , I wouldn't doubt that this movie will one day be counted as one of the best ever made . Perhaps not the ninth best ever , its current position on the imdb top 250 , but it will certainly have its place in the history books . The main reason for this is its unique narrative structure . Add this one to the ranks of Citizen Kane for its high level of narrative innovation . What it does is it tells its story backwards . It will give us one large chunk of narrative information , stop , and then rewind to the last place Leonard ( Guy Pearce ) began his small chunk of memory . You see , Leonard has this condition where he has little short-term memory . After a few minutes , he forgets everything that has happened to him since a serious injury . He reminds himself of his purpose every time he wakes up in a new chunk of memory through hosts of photos and notes that he has written to himself . His purpose : to avenge his dead wife . She was raped , and her rapist knocked poor Lenny on his head . This condition , which is the foundation of the narrative structure , is clearly false . You just have to suspend your disbelief as you watch , and , I promise you , you'll see something very unique . The best thing about this film is that it gives you some real mental exercise . It asks you to remember a large amount of information . Add to that the fact that not everything is trustworthy , and that truth and memory and facts and everything that we take for granted are constantly being questioned and warped , and you've got yourself an enjoyable uphill battle . The rest of the film is equally commendable , which ought to be remembered as long as you can retain it . The acting is quite good , especially Joe Pantoliano , so good in Bound , and Carrie-Anne Moss , with whom I was quite unimpressed in The Matrix . Here , she shows that she can play a complex character and that her main assets aren't her T & A . Guy Pearce is also quite good , though he was perhaps better in L . A . Confidential . I think someone else might have brought a bit more depth to the part , but perhaps not . One of the most difficult things about his role is the fact that he really has no complexities - he's a blank slate . One could honestly call him simply a tool of the plot . However , someone who would say that would be missing the fact that he is often being used as a tool by other characters . Christopher Nolan is not just a master scenarist , he's also an excellent director . Also great is the cinematography , sharp color with some spatterings of black and white . Perhaps there are some plot holes , but I didn't notice them . This is truly a masterpiece , a film to remember . .
384857	391152	37077	10.0	Not only funny , but completely lovable	There are some scenes which are just perfect in their comedic ability , such as the scene where Trudy subtly tries to make Norval propose to her . Much of the comedy is not of the laugh-out-loud variety , but rather of the smile and maybe giggle variety . Plus , it may be a bit hard for younger people to enjoy , for it is certainly dated . I . e . , you have to be aware of code restrictions and you have to accept them . Even if it weren't for the comedy , though , this film would be just as wonderful , anyway , for Sturges , a comedy genius , gives us characters whom we truly care for . We love Trudy and Norval . They are amongst the most endearing characters I've ever met at the movies . Emmy and the constable are just as lovely , and by the ending , I hardly wanted to leave them .
385187	391152	48037	10.0	One of Bunuel's top works	Perhaps my favorite of Buñuel's Mexican years . As a child , Archibaldo de la Cruz willed the death of his young , sexy nanny through the device of a magical music box . As an adult , he finds this box at a pawn shop , and it awakens the exciting feelings he had as he stood over the corpse of his nanny checking out her exposed thigh . He decides to become a serial killer , but it never quite works out that way . Every person he sets out to kill ends up being murdered by another's hand . Actually , I shouldn't say " person , " as Archibaldo's violent emotions only arise towards women . There is some heavy Catholic symbology to the picture , and the violence towards women obviously arises from the twisted mores of Catholicism . His first intended victim as an adult , for example , is a brazen tramp who openly expresses her wish to seduce him to get back at her husband . Buñuel had perhaps the most impeccable sense for creating finales , and the one here is as odd and remarkable as any other . Watch the two actions Archibaldo performs with his cane . I'm not 100 % sure what they signify , but I know that must be of the utmost importance . Ensayo de un crimen should be watched back to back with Buñuel's 1953 film , Él , also about a man being driven insane over his wife because of his strict religious beliefs . .
385182	391152	19959	10.0	Deeply moving	A gorgeous , all-black masterpiece . King Vidor directs a group of ( mostly ) non-actors to depict a picture of black life in the South . Daniel L . Haynes stars as Zeke , a none-too-smart cotton farmer who is tricked into wasting half a year's pay on gambling by a sexy little hoochie ( Nina Mae McKinney ) . When Zeke gets in a fight with the man who cheated to win his money , tragedy strikes . In a fit of grief , he begins to belt out a gospel song and the people around him think he should become a priest . Not only is this a great gospel musical , it's a great religious drama , one where the emotions of faith seem deeply felt and real . Vidor's direction is as good as it ever was . When a lot of the films of 1929 were clunky and static , this one has a beautiful visual and aural flow with only a couple of small stumbles along the way .
384533	391152	154420	10.0	In the near future , say fifteen-twenty years , The Celebration will be ranked among the best films of foreign cinema	The Celebration is a remarkable film . It is actually the second Dogma film I've seen , after the Idiots . I am one of that film's few supporters ( there aren't even many people in the US who have seen it , and most who have , whether an American or not , don't like it ) , but The Celebration blows it away . Idioterne , though exhilarating , is flawed . This is partly due to the quickness of its conception , production , and editing . The Celebration , however , is flawless . It contains some of the greatest editing ever . Watch the scene where three characters are linked together in a split second around bath tubs and suicide . It is enough to make your heart skip a beat . Festen also has some of the most complicated characters you're ever going to see in a film , and they're involved in one of the most complex situations that could be conceived . You'll be laughing in one moment , then you'll be beaten down emotionally , and then you'll shake your fists in anger . There has been much said about the pretentiousness of Dogma ' 95 . I personally think it is a great idea . I have heard that " it seeks to destroy the very foundations of filmmaking that artists have tried for 100 years to build . " I say , good ! That's what Italian Neorealism sought to do , and it produced The Bicycle Thieves , Umberto D , and La Strada among others . It's also what the French New Wave attempted to do , and it produced Breathless , Shoot the Piano Player , and The 400 Blows . Need I say more ? I have hardly ever felt that a situation was more realistic in a film when the Dogma rules were used . The Idiots , The Celebration , and other films made in a similar style , Dancer in the Dark and Breaking the Waves . Dogma 95 is attempting to do something ORIGINAL . I know that scares the heck out of most people , but thank God for these directors . Even if they don't produce something as great as Idioterne or Festen , it will at least be interesting . I predict that in less than 20 years , The Celebration will be taught in film classes .
384883	391152	98253	10.0	One of the most underrated films ever	I was reminded of this film after sitting through the ( bad ) film The Cell . I don't know if that film's director , Tarsem , had seen Santa Sangre , but it was quite similar . For those who have not seen Santa Sangre , please do . It is basically a more foreign version of Hitchcock's Psycho . It is excessive , but its excesses are all interesting and fun to watch . Plus , I actually did care about the characters at the end of the film .
385562	391152	24480	10.0	Perhaps Rene Clair's most perfect film	Jean and Anna are young and in love . They spend Bastille Day together trying to dance the night away , trying to get in a kiss or two . Things keep getting in the way though , funny things like the rain , the whim of the band that's playing , and the stuffy old woman walking around . Unfortunately , when Jean returns home , his ex-girlfriend is waiting for him on his bed . Misunderstandings ensue , and it's not worth ruining by revealing all the wonderful things that happen through the rest of this film . I love À nous la liberté and Le million a lot , but neither of them reach the emotional peaks of Quatorze Juillet . It's still just as humorous as the other two , perhaps more so , but neither of them moved me like this one . It's not a musical , but it is imbued with very beautiful music . It's a magical film , one of the best ever made . Annabella , who also starred in Le million , is back as Anna in this one . .
384666	391152	113627	10.0	Best film of the 90s	I've never been more touched or involved by a movie relationship than by the relationship between Ben and Sera in this film . This film is a dream and it wrapped me up in its mood forever . I don't see it as being depressing . Surely some of it is , but the underlying spirit of this film lies in the main characters ' unconditional love for each other . There has never been any other film where I've believed in the love more ( except maybe Wings of Desire ) . Titanic is utterly laughable in comparison , a nightmarish teenage mentality that makes me sick to the soul . I would say that this is the only film in the 90s in my all time top ten . The performances should have both won Oscars ; Susan Surandon really did not deserve hers for Dead Man Walking . She always plays the same character . Nick Cage's and Elisabeth Shue's performances are paralleled by very few . It's too bad , but I think that most people have forgotten it . I think critics are too cynical in the 90s . Yes , there are a lot of bad films , more than usual probably . It's disconcerting that most bad films aren't put out by B-movie directors ( direct-to-video releases have stopped them ) , but by Hollywood and also the Indie filmmakers , who are truly just as bad as Hollywood in their lack of originality . Critics refuse to declare any film a masterpiece , as if there have been none this decade . Only three films have been deigned bona fide masterpieces in this decade : Schindler's List ( deserved , but only declared a masterpiece because of its director , who is hardly an auteur ) , Pulp Fiction ( deserved , but there have been many better films ) , and Fargo ( undeserved ; Siskel & Ebert made this one recognized all by themselves . Surely , it deserves recognition , but it has flaws ; originality should not be the only qualifier for a masterpiece ) . Leaving Las Vegas appeared on many top ten lists ( usually in the middle , though Roger Ebert had it as number one , though 1995 was a particularly poor year for films ) , but was shut out from the best Picture Oscars by such crowd pleasers as Babe and Braveheart . And Il Postino is just a Miramax joke . That is what really beat it out , because it hardly belonged at the Oscars at all . I know these comments have had little to do with the actual film . It would be really difficult to describe the power of this film . It is really an emotional experience , so you really have to see it . If you saw it and hated it , try it again . Just clear your head and let the mood absorb you . I hope it can give you a feeling similar to the one it has constantly given me since I saw it in 1995 .
385741	391152	97814	10.0	One of the greatest children's films ever made	This ranks up there with Pinocchio as the greatest movie for children ever made . One huge problem with most animated children's films are that the plots are so conventional and often contain very 1950s ideals for society that they become detrimental to society . One's childhood is the most impressionable time in their life , so movies that are directed towards them teach them what places different sorts of people play in society . There is a very humorous , but also very serious bit of dialogue in a film called The Last Days of Disco where characters discuss the effects Lady and the Tramp could have on little girls , depicting a young female dog falling for a vagabond Tramp . This , they muse , sets young women up to fall for rebellious men later in life . This may seem like a humorous idea , but it's absolutely true . Even good Disney movies give children these standards . As nice as The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella or Snow White and the Seven Dwarves may be , they basically teach that it is the woman's place to grow up and get married , prefereably to a handsome rich man ( perhaps the rich part is never said , but both the main male characters in these films do happen to own castles ) . The writers of these films probably had no idea that that is what they were doing , but it is . That is why Pinocchio is the best Disney movie . It is probably the only Disney animated film that I can think of that actually concerns the predicament of its target audience : children . I can hardly think of a single ( American ) animated film besides it that has a child as its main character ( oh , the Jungle Book , which is also excellent ) . Then comes Kiki's Delivery Service . It is an absolutely perfect movie about a young girl out on her own trying to handle the responsibilities of life . It is , in my opinion , the best movie that a child can watch . And not only will it teach children , it is also marvelously animated , directed , and written . There is a plethora of great characters , exciting moments , and imaginative situations . It should also expand a child's mind , not only because of the imagination involved , which will help to break children away from conventions in their film experience , thus making them more intelligent , but because it comes from another culture . It doesn't overtly show its Japaneseness , unless you count the imagination involved ( though you should count that as a credit towards Hayao Miyazaki , who is the greatest genius of animation as far as I'm concerned ) . But it may spark an interest in children old enough to understand that someone from another country made it . Also , for younger kids , Miyazaki's fantastic , equally good My Neighbor Totoro . ( ps : I have only seen the dubbed version of this film . I find it perfectly acceptable and great . Nothing made me cringe , anyway . I think Kirsten Dunst did a very good job characterizing Kiki , a much better job than Claire Danes did characterizing San from Princess Mononoke . )
385206	391152	29947	10.0	as funny as any other film ever made	I never really cared for the way a character in a Howard Hawks movie delivered their dialogue . I liked everything else about his movies - the direction , the actual dialogue , and the plots , but that rapid-fire delivery had turned me off in the past in such films as His Girl Friday , The Big Sleep , and The Thing from Another World ( which Hawks was rumored to have directed ) . Here , though , in Bringing Up Baby , everything is absolutely perfect . There is not the tiniest bit in this film that misfires . Everyone and everything is hitting bullseyes . You know how difficult that is to do when you're working with two leopards and a dog ? And it's so effortless it's almost scary . It's years ahead of its time - the only comparable talkie I can think of is Some Like it Hot , but I think Bringing Up Baby is actually better than that classic .
385212	391152	47550	10.0	Exceptionally funny	After the lamentably unseen The First Time , the next Frank Tashlin movie showing at my local revival theater was Susan Slept Here . I was sure that SSH could not live up to the high standard set by the first film . But it did , and surpassed it . Personally , I think it's one of my five or ten favorite comedies . Dick Powell ( whom I've always loved ) stars as Mark Christopher , a Hollywood screenwriter who hasn't had any success after winning an Oscar ( which , incidentally , serves as the narrator ) . He once had an idea to write a serious picture ( as opposed to the frivolous comedies that he has specialized in ) about a juvenile delinquent , which he mentioned to a policeman friend of his . Well , on Christmas Eve , that policeman , along with his partner , shows up at Mark's door with a 17 year-old juvenile delinquent as a present . Her name is Susan ( Debbie Reynolds , whom I also love , almost desperately ! ) , and the policeman proposes that Mark hang around her for a couple of days , you know , for research . He's in a hurry to take his girlfriend ( the gorgeous but ferocious Anne Francis , who would star in Forbidden Planet a couple of years later ) out on a date , but that comes to an abrupt halt when Susan answers Mark's phone . You know the schtick : Mark starts out annoyed at Susan , but they grow attached . The age difference is brought up frequently enough so it doesn't get too creepy . Mark is 35 ( [ laugh ] - maybe when Powell was dancing with Busby Berkeley ) and Susan is 17 ( Reynolds was 22 at the time , but she is probably the only actress who could get away with playing a teenager until she was in her 40s ) . For a very long time Mark doesn't respond to Susan's crush . The only major flaw in the film - and even it's acceptable - is Mark's motivation in marrying Susan . He does it , he says , to save her from six months jail time ( she has been arrested for assault on a sailor and vagrancy ) . It's not very believable , but it's also not that big a deal . The two leads are exceptional . This was Powell's last movie . After it , he retired to television , although I only call it retirement as a movie snob ; he was enormously , enormously successful in the new medium . He's more or less the straight man here . He has a particularly great scene where he watches a 20 year-old movie for which he wrote the dialogue on television . As the actors speak their horrendous dialogue , we watch Powell as he mouths their words , both a man's and a woman's ( it's a break-up scene ) , with an embarrassed look in his eyes . If Powell is good , Reynolds is masterful . She's such an odd actress , not conventional in any way . She had her own niche in Hollywood . Her acting is doll-like with its jerky movements and huge facial expressions . That isn't a criticism whatsoever . I have never seen her in a straight drama ( the closest is How the West Was Won ) ; I'd imagine she acts differently , or she never made one . In comedies like this and Singin ' in the Rain , she's absolutely perfect . There is not a moment when she's on screen during which I was not laughing myself to tears . The film also has one of the greatest supporting casts ever . Anne Francis I've already mentioned . I very much appreciate the fact that the writers didn't make her character abominable ; Susan Slept Here , although it's not a musical , is very much a direct descendent of An American in Paris and Singin ' in the Rain . One criticism I have of Singin ' is that Jean Hagan's villain is too cartoonish ( or at least I would have that criticism if Hagan weren't so damn funny in that movie ) . Francis in SSH is played sympathetically for the most part . Glenda Farrell plays Mark's secretary , Maude , an alcoholic who answers the telephone on Christmas morning : " You talk , I can't . " Alvy Moore is Mark's friend and assistant , Virgil , who can crack wise with the best of them . Horace McMahon and Herb Vigran play the two cops , and Les Tremayne plays Mark's lawyer , who is obsessive about his therapy sessions . Red Skeleton has a wordless but amusing cameo as Maude's teenage sweetheart . .

The joke I refer to is when one of the chicks eats a grasshopper as big as he is , and bounces around when the grasshopper refuses to stop . This is a very funny cartoon to be found on the new Silly Symphonies DVD collection .
385810	391152	87188	10.0	Left me gasping for air . . .	Conventional knowledge has it that the only film of Fellini's worth a damn after 8 ½ is Amarcord . Earlier this afternoon , I would have gladly agreed , but tonight I have discovered that this is a fallacy . I present to you And the Ship Sails On . . . , a film that is not only to be ranked alongside Fellini's permanent , almost unquestionable masterpieces , La Strada , Nights of Cabiria , La Dolce Vita , 8 ½ , and Amarcord , but one to be ranked among the best works in cinema . Perhaps this is the most underrated film ever made by a true master , the man who literally was the first filmmaker to be called " auteur " by Andre Bazin in an article about Nights of Cabiria . I would describe this film as a close relative of Amarcord's . The style of characterization is identical - instead of of a close character study , the sort of characterization most film lovers tend to like , the characters in these two films are drawn more broadly , with more attention paid to unique physical features and behavioral quirks . This is all in an attempt to have the audience identify the characters - or , more precisely , caricatures ( before he made movies , Fellini worked as a caricaturist on the streets of Rome ) - in a stereotypical way . Take Titta's parents from Amarcord - they're whom we might draw if we were asked to draw bickering parents . Take the Duke from And the Ship Sails On - could you imagine a teenage , Teutonic duke any other way than Fellini presents him ? You could also take it the other way - when you see this odd fellow on screen , do you have any doubt that he is Germanic royalty ? The visual style is also similar to Amarcord's - that one was painted with cartoonish colors . And the Ship Sails On is also very colorful , but the palette is more specified here - a beautiful canvas of blue-grays and whites . The narrative styles of the two films differ quite a bit , but still are similar . Amarcord taps the vein of nostalgia - perhaps the most untapped of human emotions - for its affect . And the Ship Sails On seems to be going for absurdist , surreal satire . It's a genre that is more or less dead in the world of cinema , which is why , I assume , this film was such a bomb in 1984 and is relatively unknown today . Why satirize the aristocracy of the WWI era anyhow ? That's a good question , but one that is not difficult to answer . I don't believe that Fellini meant the film as any kind of biting satire . It's all done in fun , although the juxtaposition of the rich with the Serbian refugees , whom the ship's crew finds afloat on sinking rafts one night , does ring with a certain painful and ironic truth about how the rich see the poor . Still , even though we might scoff at the way the aristocrats try to trace the roots of Serbian dances back to ancient times , the scene immediately following it , where those aristocrats go down on the deck to dance with the Serbians , is very entertaining and beautiful . The music in that scene , in fact , the music throughout the entire film , made me want to clap and dance . The actors move rhythmically as they progress through the film . I also have to add that Fellini never made a funnier film , at least of the ones I've seen , which are a majority of them ( Toby Dammit of the omnibus film Spirits of the Dead comes very close ) . Most of this film's greatness lies in individual scenes , and thus , as you might guess , the sum is not exactly equal to the parts - at least as far as I saw , there's no real point - the substance is thin . But when style is this beautiful , I say screw substance . Each individual scene ranks among the best ever put to film - the wine glass concert , the scene where sunlight brightens one half of the ship and moonlight the other , the boiler room scene where the great opera singers compete vocally in order to impress the sailors below , the interview with the duke , and the opera singer's funeral . Each scene is so exquisitely created by Fellini and every other artist involved that it is entirely forgiveable if the audience remembers those individual images rather than an overall effect . For me , the combination did have an overall effect : I was so awestruck that I was weeping , though there was nothing onscreen to weep at . .
385935	391152	37800	10.0	Beautiful . One of the best romances ever filmed	SPOILERSMichael Powell and Emeric Pressburger are master filmmakers , and I Know Where I'm Going is one of their greatest films . The only one that I've seen that I think is better is A Matter of Life in Death ( in America called Stairway to Heaven ) , but this film is very close . It concerns a woman who knows where she's going : to an island of the Hebrides , Kiloran , to marry a rich man , her boss . She arrives at the seashore where she can see Kiloran , but its late and very foggy . They can't cross today . She meets a man , Torquil , who lives there and is also stuck , a descendant of royalty , but now having not much money . He tells her that , if she counts the wooden beams on her ceiling and then makes a wish , it will come true as long as she believes in it . She wishes for the wind , which has gotten strong , to keep blowing and blow the fog and clouds away . For the next several days , she is stuck where she is and she cannot stop herself from falling in love with Torquil . What results is a film of subtle beauty and intelligence . The locales of Scotland are used extraordinarily well . The film has perhaps some of the most beautiful black and white photography ever captured ( you'll really want to go to Soctland after you see it ! ) . How can the Archers be so good ? I've seen four of their films , this , A Matter of Life and Death , The Red Shoes , and Black Narcissus . The latter two I have some problems with , but they are great films ( I bought Black Narcissus sight unseen , and , although I was a bit disappointed in it the first time I watched it , I have seen it four times in six months ; it grows on me , that's for sure ) . But I just don't know : these films seem so simple . I mean , they aren't abstruse art films or anything . The level of invention is staggering , but mostly because their techniques are not overly complex . Why can't these be made anymore ? I think I Know Where I'm Going may be too old fashioned for today's audiences ( which is truly sad , however sadly true ) . I guess it's the same for those other three films . It's cynicism : the bane of modernity . PS : It is a well known fact that the inspiration for the final ballet in the 1951 film An American in Paris was The Red Shoes . Gene Kelly convinced his producers to allow him to do that ballet by showing them the 13 minute ballet sequence from The Red Shoes . The ending of I Know Where I'm Going resembles the ending of An American in Paris . I wonder if Kelly and Vincente Minnelli were fans of this film , also . Anyone know ?
385515	391152	109066	10.0	A masterpiece	I don't even know where to begin on Vive L'Amour . It is the second Tsai Ming-liang film I've seen , after The Hole . I doubted that it could be as good as The Hole , but it turned out to be an even better film . In fact , I'd say it's pretty close to perfect . The only thing I don't like about it is its American title - " Vive L'Amour " makes it sound like a romantic comedy starring Gerard Depardieu . This film is about love , but not in any conventional way . I'd love to relate the plot of the film , but I think that'd ruin it quite a bit . Part of the fun of it is figuring out exactly what's going on . Those who like puzzle films will find the initial puzzle of Vive L'Amour very intriguing . Those who don't like slow-moving films should avoid it , though . A good benchmark : if you like Antonioni's films , especially L'Avventura , which is directly referenced in this film , you'll probably like it . Here's an intriguing fact about Vie L'Amour : there is not one piece of audible dialogue spoken until 21 minutes have gone by . One of the main characters does not speak until 49 minutes have passed . If you were to write out all the dialogue of the film , you could probably fit it on a single page . Tsai is simply audacious in his paucity of dialogue . And it could have easily seemed like little more than a stunt , but the characters still come off as fully developed and interesting people . The drama works wonders , and there is a lot of comedy , too . The film is also very erotic . I really don't want to say another word about this film . I hope that any reader will have enjoyed or agreed with the numerous other reviews I have written to take my recommendation at face value . I have seen hundreds of great films , and Vive L'Amour is one of the best I have seen . Also , make sure to check out The Hole , which is also on Fox Lorber DVD . Fox Lorber has gotten a lot of undeserved criticism in the past . Their DVDs aren't always the best ( they're no Criterion ) , but they're usually of great visual quality . They may have few extras , but extras are not always necessary . I would even suggest that Criterion sometimes stuffs their DVDs with unnecessary and low-quality material .
385618	391152	60277	10.0	A favorite of mine	It's not especially deep , but it's a dark and disturbing chambara about a merciless samurai , Ryunosuke ( Tatsuya Nakadai ) , who can ? and will , without hesitation ? kill anybody who challenges him with a sword . He sees himself as a force of karmic balance . The film starts off with him disposing of an old man praying for death . The film is based on a newspaper serial that began in the 1910s and continued for several decades . The story never really ended , and , likewise , the film , which only covers certain bits of the novel , has no resolution . This has often bothered people , but I think it works well . Whatever the case , even if the film doesn't satisfy you as a whole , there are a number of outstanding setpieces . Nakadai's being ambushed in the forest near the beginning . The battle in the snow , where Toshiro Mifune dispatches of a dozen or more attackers while Nakadai watches cautiously from the sidelines . And that final sequence is the mother of all rampages , where Nakadai goes apesht in a brothel . Tatsuya Nakadai is really a fantastic actor . I know , his performance here isn't particularly complex , but he is absolutely frightening in his infinite evil . Compare this to his overwhelming humanity in The Human Condition . Okamoto's direction is assured , and Hiroshi Murai provides some of the best black & white photography ever captured . The new Criterion disc is quite good . It is without extras , but the accompanying essay is a big help at putting the film and its source material in context .
384532	391152	58279	10.0	A masterpiece .	Kwaidan is a somewhat difficult work . Its four stories , with the exception of one , are not very involving and they can even become a little boring in their narrative . They are not very frightening , although they all attain a level of creepiness . Except for " Hoichi , the Earless , " one of the most stunning tales I've ever experienced in a film , you can see the ending coming from a long ways away ( the final episode , " In a Cup of Tea , " is a little different , in that it has no ending , per se ; the ending the filmmakers do come up with is a little disappointing ) . The reason that this film is a masterpiece is its masterful composition . I think I have heard that Kobayashi was a painter . Even if I just made that up , it would fit . The colors are godly . Any frame of the film is a masterful painting . If you are interested in composition and cinematography in film , this is the one to see . If you only care about narrative , read books . Don't watch films . But at least see " Hoichi the Earless " for its composition and story . I suggest buying the Criterion released DVD . It is one of the cheaper DVDs of that company . And you don't have to watch the four stories in succession . If you watch them apart , and they could very easily be watched apart , the boredom factor will fade from existence .
385356	391152	443680	10.0	One of the best so far this decade	This almost defines the oft-used term " elegiac Western " . It has some of the well-worn themes of Westerns , such as the creation of Western myth vs . the cold , harsh realities . But for some reason , it never feels like anything else I've ever seen . It has a style more reminiscent of Michelangelo Antonioni than any of the great Western filmmakers . It's slow and likes to surround its characters with enormous landscapes that almost swallow them whole . But it's also not averse to close-ups . Director Dominik , who has only made one other film , Chopper , and it's been seven years since then , loves to concentrate on facial expressions , as well as body language ( don't know if I've ever seen a film with this level of attention to body language , or maybe it's just not something to which I've ever been lead to pay much attention ) . The cast is uniformly brilliant . Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck are the titular leads , and neither has done as well . Affleck is a revelation . The supporting cast includes Sam Rockwell , Mary-Louise Parker , Jeremy Renner , Garrett Dillahunt and Paul Schneider . Andrew Dominik is the star , though . There have been plenty of successful Westerns over the past couple of decades , but I'd be hard-pressed to name a single one out that so beautifully and completely re-invents the genre . 3 : 10 to Yuma may well be the big money-making Western of the year , but I think history will recall it as being the year that The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford was released . It is the best film of the year so far , and will be hard to top .
385107	391152	20768	10.0	The sun rises again	Murnau's third American film after Sunrise and the lost Four Devils , and his penultimate before Tabu . City Girl , of the surviving three , is the least seen . The reason for this must be its close resemblance to Sunrise , which is a masterpiece of the first order . Yes , City Girl does remind one of Sunrise in its mood and focus . A young rube from Minnesota ( Charles Farrell ) travels to Chicago to sell his father's wheat crop . Business-wise , the trip doesn't go well , but his romantic world blossoms when he meets up with a lonely waitress ( Mary Duncan ) . The two marry , and the rest of the film deals with Duncan's fight for acceptance on the farm , where she faces a fierce opponent in her father-in-law ( David Torrence ) . The film is romantic , emotionally moving and utterly beautiful . Yes , it is a lot like Sunrise , but , heck , who wouldn't want a second Sunrise ? It's hardly a carbon copy , anyway , so it's like another wonderful gift . City Girl is a masterpiece , as well . I'm not the biggest fan of Murnau's German films , but his three surviving American films are probably the best proof of the sentiment that the silent cinema was at a miraculous level right when it was snuffed by sound . Murnau tragically died in an auto accident in 1931 . I find it hard to imagine his work in the talkies , but I have an inkling that the cinema would be rather different if he had survived .
385720	391152	389557	10.0	Exceptional flick . One of the best 2007 releases .	Stunning , gripping WWII thriller that plays like a pulpier version of Jean-Pierre Melville's Army of Shadows . That's not something that should be criticized , I think . There's nothing wrong with being entertaining when dealing with serious subjects , as long as the film stays respectful of its subject . And Black Book is respectful . It's tense and exciting , but it always made me understand that these were real people who were undergoing real suffering . I was both extremely entertained and involved in the situation of these characters . Carice van Houten stars , and is brilliant as a Jewish girl who escapes several near-death encounters to end up working with the Dutch resistance movement near the end of the war . She infiltrates a Nazi headquarters by seducing an officer ( Sebastian Koch of The Lives of Others ) . While the film starts off as a very black and white , resistance vs . Nazis flick , things get more and more complicated and , after a while , no one can be trusted . You never know what will happen next . The film-making is very classic , and nearly perfect . Verhoeven has always been an interesting filmmaker , but his work is plagued by sloppiness in both direction and writing . Black Book exhibits few flaws ( I might have rethought the opening , which assures us immediately that the protagonist will survive the war ) . It's one of the most satisfying cinematic experiences I've had in a very long time .
385850	391152	111873	10.0	The best television series ever on television . Go get your mind warped today !	If I were to make a list of the top ten television shows ever made , I would put Aeon Flux at # 1 . If I were to make a list of the top ten television shows and movies combined , it would end up at # 2 ( if you read my other comments , you'll notice that I often exalt films that I've seen in a similar top ten list format and that I have said that many films are this high on the list , but that was usually right after seeing it without any retrospect ; I have seen every episode of Aeon Flux at least 10 times , so I have the proper retrospect here ) . It only falls behind Stanley Kubrick's 2001 . Like 2001 , Aeon Flux is a mind-bending series that pushed the limits of narrative . As Trevor Goodchild says in the final episode of this series ( so far ; they've said that they might come back ) , " End Sinister " : " A person from a thousand years ago could never comprehend the world today . " Well , Aeon Flux is about 800 years in the future , because one has to see all the episodes several times before they begin to make sense . I like this , because the first few times you can appreciate the art . After you have seen each episode multiple times , you notice how amazingly and originally the narrative is constructed . So don't get angry at the series if you don't understand it initially . Begin with the more conventional ( though that word can hardly describe this television series ) episodes . Rent or buy ( it is certainly good enough to buy without having seen it before ; look at my other comments to see if you agree with my tastes , then go for it if you do ) the red cassette ( which is also on DVD ) , and watch the first two episodes , " Thanatophobia " and " A Last Time for Everything . " Then on the Blue Tape , watch " Reraizure , " the first episode . Next , go to intermediate episodes , " Isthmus Crypticus , " " Ether Drift Theory , " " The Demiurge , " " Utopia or Deuteronopia , " and " End Sinister " ( though you may want to save that for the end ) . Then , for the advanced class , go to the silent episodes on the red and yellow tapes , then see the hardest-to-get episodes " The Purge " and , by far the most mindbending and 2001-like , " Chronophasia . " Personally , I like the simple beauty of " Thanatophobia " and " A Last Time for Everything " best , but " The Purge " and " Chronophasia " will warp your mind for sure . And like I said , don't dismiss them if you don't understand them . Think about each episode as an individual structure and then as a part of the whole . And if you're truly impressed , good luck finding the Aeon Flux book they published , _ The Herodotus File _ . It will help in your understanding if you have the good luck to find it . Also , another miraculously-produced MTV animated series marvel that you might like if you like this is The Maxx . It can usually be found on the shelf with Anime films , but if not , it can be purchased just as Aeon Flux can . It , if I were to list it along with the greatest television series and films , would be # 3 . So please , go get your mind warped today by Aeon Flux and The Maxx !
385279	391152	40369	10.0	Brilliantly acted , directed , and written	One of John Ford's greatest films , the first of his so-called Cavalry Trilogy . Henry Fonda stars as Lt . Col . Owen Thursday , a former Union General . He gets assigned to a cavalry post in the Southwest , an assignment that he considers unimportant . He brings his daughter , Philadelphia , with him . She is played by a 16 year-old Shirley Temple , who is actually rather good . John Wayne has just about equal screen time as Fonda playing Capt . Kirby York , who has been stationed at Fort Apache for a while . York , who is familiar with the area , and Thursday , who wants most of all to win glory , clash constantly . The film unfolds beautifully , with many beautiful and exciting moments occurring along the way . I particularly love the Cavalry Trilogy because of the adherence to strict military dialogue . Of course I wouldn't know , but it sounds very authentic . I love the men barking orders and others ' compliance in this overly formal language , and with a clear but subtle expression of their feelings and attitudes . It takes great actors to do that , and Fort Apache is a showcase for a large number of excellent actors . Of course there're Fonda and Wayne , both giving their utmost to the project , but also a ton of Ford's favorite players , Pedro Armendariz , WardBond , and Victor McLaglen amongst others . John Agar , in his first film , has a very important role , as well . Pay close attention to the way Native Americans are portrayed in this film . At first , the references might cause your knee to jerk , but mind who says what . Note the beauty of the scene where John Wayne approaches the Apache warrior Chochise . That might be the best shot in a Ford film , although it's competing with about a hundred others ! Watch out for the theme of myth vs . reality in that final sequence , which would be expanded many years later in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance . .
384827	391152	15881	10.0	The mother of all melodramas !	I just finished watching the recent reconstruction of this film that was commissioned by TCM a couple of years ago . Everyone knows the history of this film , at least everyone who's ever heard of it . Von Stroheim's first cut was about nine and a half hours long . MGM , of course , couldn't release such an enormous monster . No one would be willing to sit down for that long in a theater except maybe Erich von Stroheim ! They demanded that he cut it , and he complied . The second cut was around four hours long . Still to long , MGM shouted . They took it away from him and cut it down to around two and a half hours , which was still fairly long for the time , though not unprecedented ( think D . W . Griffith ) . Von Stroheim was outraged . Because of this film , and also other films that he attempted to make in the same era , he was eventually disallowed ever to direct another film in Hollywood . Of course , he made at least two memorable appearances as an actor , first in Jean Renoir's The Grand Illusion and then in Billy Wilder's Sunset Blvd . For seventy-some years , the 2 . 5 hour version of Greed circulated . From what I can tell , it was much beloved , but somewhat difficult to follow . Cineastes pray to God that the missing reels are someday found , but the hope is never strong , because that would be quite impossible . But now this new version exists , with missing pieces filled in by publicity stills . It can actually be quite confusing , especially in the first half or so . I still want to see the 2 . 5 hour cut sometime , so I can see what was dropped and see if the remaining film is coherent . It took me a long time , at least an hour and a half , to start to appreciate Greed . Four hours is quite an investment , and I was growing weary for a long while . But after a certain point the film just gets better and better . The film is basically a long melodrama . A man and a woman get married . We experience their trials and their hardships . Both of these characters are overcome with greed . The wife becomes a miser . She has won $5000 in a lottery , but she demands that it stay in the bank and accumulate interest . Meanwhile , she and her husband go poor with that money sitting idle . The husband , on the other hand , spends every nickle he has as soon as he gets a hold of it . Elsewhere , we are given two more examples of the effects of money on people . A Mexican woman ( the one who sells the wife the lottery ticket ) drives a junkyard manager , her husband , wild with mythic stories of hidden treasures . In another subplot , an old man learns that his hobby is worth something and he gets $5000 , enough to court his neighbor , an aging , unmarried woman . These subplots will not be found in the original cut of the film . By the end of the long journey , I realized that I absolutely loved Greed . I immediately began to pray that someday every meter of the film will be recovered . I know it'll be a fruitless hope , but there are worse things to wish for ! .
385587	391152	48933	10.0	Mizoguchi's final film , and his final masterpiece	Mizoguchi's swan song is one of his best , personally my second favorite film after Life of Oharu . This is the story of a group of modern day prostitutes in the red light district of Tokyo . Their sad stories are basic melodramas , but they are deeply affecting nonetheless . One is working to support her sick husband and their baby ; they had planned to kill themselves until she found out she was pregnant . One went into the business to support a son who now rejects disowns her as his mother . One gets out of the business by marrying , but finds that marriage is even more demeaning than prostitution . One particularly clever one is manipulating a businessman to buy her way out of the place . Another ran away from home with an American G . I . and has begun to mimic Western attitudes and dress , which is a good selling point . Machiko Kyo is the standout as Mickey , the Westernized girl . She has the single best scene , where her father comes looking for her to bring her home . It's a stock scene , really , but Mizoguchi and Machiko Kyo turn it in a direction that I really didn't expect . I was liking the film a lot before this scene without loving it , but this bit blew me away ? I loved every second thereafter . Scene after powerful scene lead up to one of the most amazing final shots in a film ever . Throughout the film , we are informed that politicians are trying to outlaw prostitution . In the film , it keeps failing . Due to this film that bill was finally passed .
384942	391152	57940	10.0	The Culmination of Ford's Career ( Part 1 of 2 )	Another vastly underrated John Ford masterpiece , Cheyenne Autumn is one of his most powerful and poignant . Many see it as an apologia for his career of demonizing the red man , and perhaps there's something to that , but , for the most part , the idea that he demonized Native Americans is a misinterpretation . The modern , PC idea of a Native American is a guy sitting around in a teepee making a dreamcatcher . It's actually more insulting , as many tribes , especially the ones which are depicted in John Ford's Westerns , that is , the Apaches , Comanches , and Cheyenne , were brave and proud warriors with an impeccable talent for fighting . This can be seen very clearly in a film like Fort Apache , which shows the Apache in a very respectful light . You can tell John Ford was in awe of these people . Of course , you also have Rio Grande , which basically does fit all the stereotypes , with the Indians kidnapping a wagon full of children . Of course , historically some tribes did tend to do some pretty nasty things , and the Comanches depicted in The Searchers , the film that most often garners these ill feelings , were a very cruel tribe . Whatever one's feelings about John Ford's films , Cheyenne Autumn does set out to dispell them . At heart , it is a very didactic film . Whether Ford's films were or were not demonizing the Indians , most of the young people who watched his and others ' Westerns weren't likely to see anything but demons . They just don't have the power of interpretation . Cheyenne Autumn is the only Ford film to tell a story from the point of view of the Native American characters . I was about to say that it might have been the first film to do so , but I hate making those kind of statements . When I do so I am inevitably wrong . The story concerns the Cheyenne tribe . Promised a visit by government officials , who were asked to come and view the wretched state of life on a reservation , they decide to jump the reservation and go back home when no one shows up . Little Wolf ( Ricardo Montelban , unrecognizable except for his voice ) and Dull Knife ( Gilbert Roland ) lead the tribe . Dull Knife is married to a woman only known as Spanish Woman ( Delores del Rio ) and their impetuous son , whom I don't think is ever named in the film ( in the credits he's listed as " Red Shirt " ) , is played by Sal Mineo . And , damn , Plato got buff ! Accompanying them is a Quaker woman , Deborah ( Carroll Baker ) , who wants to teach them and keep their children safe . We accompany them on their 1 , 500 mile trek . About half of the film is told from the Cheyenne's point of view . Most of the rest is told from that of the cavalry ordered to stop them and bring them back to the reservation . Leading them is Capt . Archer ( Richard Widmark ) , who completely understands the tribe's feelings about the matter . He is also worried about Deborah , whom he loves deeply . Tellingly , we never get the idea that he is afraid that the Cheyenne themselves will harm her , and I mean that we don't get that idea from either perspective . He wants to accomplish his task without getting anyone hurt , either Cheyenne or cavalry , or whoever else might wander into the picture . Ford veterans Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr . play his scouts , a role which each of them played way back in the Cavalry Trilogy . Archer also has the task of keeping Sec . Lieut . Scott on task . He wants desperately to get in a row with the Cheyenne , as his father died in an earlier battle . Scott is played by Patrick Wayne , yes , the son of John Wayne . This character represents that young child who plays Cowboys & Indians with his friends . " I've been waiting for this chance ever since I was ten , " says Scott excitedly . He learns respect for his enemies when he falls into one of their dangerous traps . Another small thread of narrative concerns the Secretary of the Interior in Washington , played by Edward G . Robinson . Robinson wants badly to help the Cheyenne , inspired by his own fighting on behalf of the abolition of slavery in his youth during the Civil War . At one point , when others are pressuring him to punish the Cheyenne , he sadly asks Abraham Lincoln what he should do .
