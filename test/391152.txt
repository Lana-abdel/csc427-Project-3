385154	391152	116059	1.0	Most appropriate title ever	More thought should have gone into the title for this film . They had to have known it was awful when they were making it . I saw it because I was a fan of Kinnear's from his Talk Soup days . It is absolutely worthless , though , other than one transcendent moment : Rue McClanahan , Blanche from the Golden Girls , is going blind , and her son , Kinnear , makes her feel Coolio's face as a joke . It's not funny . It's just bizarre .
385018	391152	382625	3.0	Critics were right : it stinks , big time !	The critical reaction to this film was just vile , but then a lot of normal people who saw it afterward said , " Nah , it's pretty good . " I'm here to tell you that the initial critical reception was right on the money for this one . It's God-awful . A symbologist and a cryptologist ( two fields of study which probably do exist , I suppose , but sound awfully made-up ) get framed for murder and get caught up in an ages-old clash between factions of the Catholic church . The movie mostly consists of the two scholars ( Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou ) racing from one locale to another solving riddles and puzzles , and just barely escaping the cops and the villains each time . The puzzles are reminiscent of the ones the Riddler produced on the 1960s Batman show : they're completely inane ; no one could ever solve them , certainly not the audience . But somehow the heroes figure it all out in a matter of seconds . It's about as much fun as watching someone do a Sudoku when you don't know the rules . And the characters are as paper-thin as they could possibly be . I had absolutely zero involvement with them or their adventure . Dan Brown's novel is famously terrible , and , while I've often heard cinema improves his painful prose , after watching this film I shiver to think what actually reading him feels like . If the plot weren't enough to convince me , the dialogue is terrible . The actors are all only here for the fat paycheck . Hanks in particular seems completely dissatisfied with the part . Possibly the worst movie of the year .
385750	391152	408839	3.0	Ugly and misogynistic . What happened to the Farrelly Brothers ?	It's way too bad about the Farrelly Brothers . It looked like they were going to be the great comedians of modern cinema after their first three films , Dumb & Dumber , Kingpin and There's Something about Mary , but all of their subsequent films have been disappointments . Me , Myself and Irene , Shallow Hal , Stuck on You and Fever Pitch were all decent movies , but none of them had the cojones of their first three . They seemed to be getting sweeter , which wouldn't be such a bad thing if they didn't also lose their edge . Well , their new film , The Heartbreak Kid , proves that their edge is completely dulled . Where they were able to combine a certain humanity with the gross-out jokes in a film like There's Something about Mary , it now feels like they are just desperately cramming them into The Heartbreak Kid . None of the dirty jokes work . They're all groan-inducing . Nothing seems more out of place than a Tijuana donkey show . The incongruity of it all isn't even what ruins the movie , unfortunately . It's the way they treat women , or at least one woman , Malin Akerman . Man , does this movie come off as misogynistic . I'm guessing that , in the original film , written by Neil Simon , there's more insight into how bad a person the protagonist is ( there played by Charles Grodin , here by the every day more dire Ben Stiller ) . It doesn't feel like there's much insight into Stiller's character , and I think we're actually supposed to like him and root for him to get into a relationship with the " good girl " , here played by Michelle Monaghan . In the end ( and especially in the end , given the final twist of the film ) , I hated the guy . Akerman comes off as nasty , but Stiller's character doesn't even deserve to get peed on by her .
384750	391152	241527	3.0	How to take advantage of your children's naivety for the sake of cold cash . . .	I have , in all my life as a lover of both literature and the cinema , hardly ever come upon a piece of work more unimaginative , more ugly , more uninteresting , more lacking in suspense , more lacking in charm , more greedy , more incoherent . . . Okay , okay . I'll stop with the superlative negatives . Surely there have been worse , and , yes , off the top of my head , I can think of many that are worse . However , for a book that over 125 million people have read , and for a movie that cemented the record for the biggest opening weekend in history , and also for a book that has had not only kids but critics singing its praises , and also for a movie which one particularly fat-headed critic called the Wizard of Oz of its generation , I am more than severely disappointed . I know that , had it not been so overhyped , it would have been just as bad . Now , however , my anger for it is completely hardened and it's going to be a passionate battle for me for years to come . I go into an in depth criticism , but it would be impossible for me to keep to 1000 words . There is hardly a piece of it that I liked . As a film , it was poorly edited , poorly acted ( by most ) , poorly filmed . The only really memorable scene is the troll in the bathroom , although the payoff to it makes no sense whatsoever . The Quidditch game , which has been hyped to all heaven , is completely boring and poorly created . It looks like the FX guys created it with photoshop . When the chess game looked like it was about to be the most exciting sequence in the film , Christopher Columbus , who , I must say , lives up to his reputation completely , begins to edit furiously . I heard afterwards that this was done to avoid a PG-13 . My immediate thought is that the filmmakers didn't trust their young audience to enjoy watching a chess game , no matter how exciting it might have been . I'm still not sure which story to buy . But the person I really want to tear into is J . K . Rowling . What a hack . Never has the word " hack " been more fitting . A former waitress , her idea of imagination is to call things by weird names . Only in the mind of a psychopath ( or idiot ) could the name Draco Malfoy or a Cerberus clone named Fluffy be considered clever . Writing children's literature is not difficult , but this is simply awful . She's clearly ripping off Raoul Dahl like there's no tomorrow , especially in the exposition . The game of Quidditch , which seems to be a drawing point of some sort , is absolutely nonsensical . As a preteen , I invented much more interesting games with much less interesting playing pieces . Quidditch is a game where people score ten points at a time , unless someone catches a special type of ball , which ends the game immediately . So theoretically , the game could end in thirty seconds . And all the other forms of scoring matter not at all . And let's talk about the surprise climax . Really , anyone could have been standing in front of that mirror at the end . It is tremendously unclever . And the penultimate sequence , where the crown is awarded to the best dorm , is anticlimactic and just rude to the children of Slytherin , We only hate one of them , so why should we be happy that the award at first goes to them , and then is cruelly snatched away . And what about Hogwart , anyways ? If you're not supposed to use magic when you're away from Hogwart , why the heck would you want to be a wizard anyways ? Friends , you're well on the path to making your children drooling morons . If they want a great series of books about sorcery and magic creatures , make them read the Chronicles of Narnia by C . S . Lewis . This is the most soulless garbage imaginable . And I thought Shrek had taken that title .
385615	391152	432021	3.0	First film I saw on Blu Ray . Hi-def doesn't make it any better	If nothing else , this movie will be a landmark in my film viewing life : it was the first movie I ever saw on Blu Ray ( a buddy bought a Playstation 3 ) . If not for that , I'm sure it'd be one for the dustbin of my memory . Granted , it's hard to judge fairly when I never saw the first two installments of this based-on-a-video game trilogy , but Resident Evil : Extinction can only barely count as a movie . It's a post-apocalyptic zombie movie where a genetically engineered woman with excellent fighting abilities ( model / musician Milla Jovovich ? I refuse to acknowledge her as an actress ) helps a ragtag band of survivors escape to Alaska , while she herself infiltrates the underground layer of the Umbrella Corporation , which created the virus that zombified the rest of the world . The plot is mostly nonexistent . I kind of like the set and costume designs ( sci-fi being every set and costumer designer's favorite gene ) , and the movie's watchable when it focuses on the scenery . But it's an action movie , and , for God's sake , the action sequences are dull . CGI looks even more fake in high definition . The director and / or editor cut madly during these sequences , inducing headaches and making it impossible for you to tell what's going on . It's a pretty worthless film , and let's leave it at that .
385145	391152	356618	3.0	Would be better off forgotten itself ( possible spoilers )	Almost a textbook example of what a film critic would refer to as ' underbaked ' . The Forgotten is a conspiracy thriller with one half a good idea behind it . Even more unfortunately , behind that half a good idea lies piss poor script development . So that takes it down to half of a half of a film that had some potential . Julianne Moore plays a woman who lost her nine year-old son in a plane crash 14 months earlier . Lately , the memory of the child seems to be disappearing all the more . Her husband doesn't acknowledge the son's existence , and all corroborating evidence seems to have disappeared . Is she losing her mind ? Only in a good movie . No , it's a conspiracy . She confirms this when she meets up with the father of one of her son's friends , who also lost his offspring in the same crash ( played by Dominic West ) . They unite to try to figure out what happened . Meanwhile , the government comes after them . Straight from Gerald Di Pego's screenplay class , there is a subplot involving a police investigator ( Alfre Woodard ) and Moore's psychologist ( Gary Sinise ? if he's in a movie you know there's a conspiracy ! ) who both start to believe the protagonist and want to help her . The movie becomes fairly nonsensical as it moves on . Characters just don't act like real people would . After strange things begin to happen , Moore and West still plod on in search for their possibly alive children without the fear any real person would develop . When the nature of the conspiracy is finally revealed in full , tons of interesting questions should arise . Nope . I just want my kid , sir . It reminds me of an episode of South Park where the kids go on an adventure simply to retrieve their stolen video game system . When they finally find it , they just start playing , as the incidental characters reveal vast intergalactic goings-on . Nope . Just let me play my video game , sir . .
385297	391152	203632	3.0	A 10 . 0 on the pretention scale	SPOILERS SPOILERS Oh Christ ! My worst fears came true ! Tom Tykwer was told so often by both critics and audiences that he was a freakin ' genius that he actually believed it . Of course , his previous film was Run Lola Run , a smash hit on the festival circuit , and subsequently in the video stores , a couple of years ago . That film hinted that its director had some talent , but it played too much like a hip music video director's notion of a Kieslowski film . In the end , the excessiveness served only to give me a massive headache . It was also painfully lacking in substance , although I was pretty sure that Tykwer thought it was chocked full of it . The Princess and the Warrior is unfortunately a step backwards . Way backwards . Tykwer has no restraint and he certainly doesn't have a critical eye when looking at his own work . It sort of has similar themes to RLR , fate and interconnections and such . Absolutely none of it works . Few films have such an egregious lack of cohesion . I don't think there is a single scene in the entire film I thought succeeded . Take a look at this scene ( don't worry , no spoilers ) : after being rejected by the man who saved her life , Sissi ( Franka Potente ) walks out in the rain . In slow motion , she stops , and then the rain ceases . She lays down in the wet grass and looks up at the stars . Brilliant , huh ? Maybe if a middle schooler came up with it . An adult , I hope , would giggle at it . I won't ruin it ( I think you have to see it to believe it ) , but the final sequence is so bad that the audience was laughing their heads off . And Tykwer , as always , wasn't joking . He thought he was being profound . Another thing : I could tell you more , much more about the two main characters from Run Lola Run than I could about the characters in P & W , which is , incidentally , nearly an hour longer than RLR . In fact , I could tell you more about secondary and tertiary characters in RLR . All of the secondary characters in P & W are caricatures , especially the offensive stereotypes you're going to find in the mental hospital scenes . Stop for a brief second : for God's sake , Tykwer , it's like you don't even realize that that whole mental hospital schtick was done to death twenty , maybe even thirty years ago . Christ ! Anyway , before I relate the only bit of back story we get for the two major characters , I'll issue a SPOILERS warning . Sissi : yeah , um , apparently , though it's not clear , her dad's one of the patients . Her mom was electrocuted in the bath tub by a hair drier that mysteriously fell into it . This is explained near the end of the film , but it's rather laughable . After those two facts , nothing else . I knew absolutely nothing about her , except that she works at a mental hospital and is not opposed to masturbating her patients . Why does Tykwer even include this scene , btw ? I'll tell you : it is simply to shock . Does it say anything whatsoever about Sissi ? It serves little purpose . The same goes for half a dozen other scenes in the film , like when one of the patients gets mad and starts to eat glass . Riemer : okay , now this is especially funny , although it's played , if you can believe it , as straight drama : he was arguing with his girlfriend one day in the car ( we know nothing about her ) , so , when he was in the bathroom at a gas station , she , um , lit a cigarette and blew herself to smithereens . I would say that this has to be the stupidest I'm - depressed - 'cause - my - girlfriend's - dead backstory in the history of the cinema , and the world , for that matter . Actually , there's that great one in The Naked Gun where Leslie Nealson tells the ol ' boy - meets - girl - girl - dies - in - a - tragic - blimp - accident story . I think the one in P & W is funnier . END SPOILERSAnother thing that bugs the hell out of me is Tykwer's use of music . In RLR , the film is so steeped in execrable techno that it either hypnotizes you and carries you past the numerous flaws or it gives you epilepsy . The same is true of P & W , except that the score is a bit more traditional . The film is never once suspenseful , but you could easily be tricked into thinking it was just by the music . Actually , there is a simple piano score during the bank robbery sequence that is so beautiful I was nearly fooled into thinking the scene was the only good one in the film . It would have remained that way in my mind if not for the fact that I started to think about what was going on . The acting is pretty horrible , also . The two main characters have a combined total of two expressions . This rather disappoints me . Although I disliked Run Lola Run , I thought that Potente was quite pretty and that she might be able to act in a real film . I was wrong . My guess now would be that , even in a film where the characters are well developed , she would be poor . Maybe I should rent Blow and check out if I am right on that . So what did I like about P & W ? Well , as you can probably guess , very little . However , I can recognize that Tykwer ( or , more correctly , his photographer ) has a talent for camera movement and framing . Color is sometimes used well . The editing can be interesting , though poorly used 99 % of the time . Still , with such vapid writing , no technical prowess could ever have saved The Princess and the Warrior . It's awful . .
385159	391152	404032	3.0	The most offensive movie of 2005	If not the most poorly made film of the year , it is indeed the most insulting , offensive , idiotic and just plain evil film of the year . It is , in fact , the absolute worst movie of 2005 . What makes this one particularly sting is that I was completely familiar with the true story it is based on , that of the German woman Anneliese Michel . I have or have had an interest in the occult , demonic possessions included . Not that I believe in it , but I do find stories of it interesting and often very frightening . I read of Michel's case years ago , and it's a chilling one . It is also one of the complete failure of religion which , as an atheist , delights me , I must admit . What really happened is that two priests began performing an exorcism on Anneliese . They didn't bother to care for her physically and eventually starved her to death . As a result , the Roman Catholic Church required that a physician be present at any future exorcisms that they might sanction . In Emily Rose , which moves the story to America , the priest who is accused of letting the possessed girl die is conveniently already given a doctor to observe the ceremony . It's even specifically mentioned that this is Church doctrine . This fact doesn't come into trial right away ( which doesn't make any sense ) . Anyway , we're pretty much told right off the bat that the priest ( played by Tom Wilkinson ) is completely guiltless . There's never any doubt , and no ambiguity whatsoever . The only reason he wants to go to trial is so that he can " tell Emily's story " , as he says about twenty times . And her story , as written by the girl herself , is that she died because the Virgin Mary , whom she saw in a vision , told her she had to so that the people would realize that the spiritual elements of life do in fact exist . So God lets demons take over an innocent girl's soul so that more people would believe in Him . It's Job all over again . The film ends with updates that treat the story as if it happened the way the idiots here have told it , informing us that Emily's story helped people to believe in God . One wonders why it wouldn't do the exact opposite .
385969	391152	458525	3.0	Nooooooooooooooooooo ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	Way to start the summer , Marvel . This is a prequel to a series of mostly decent comic book movies - I'd rank the second one , X2 , as maybe the second or third best comic book movie ever . It concerns the origin of the series ' most popular character , Wolverine . Well , that's kind of a lie . It's not really that concerned with anything . It's an indifferently created action movie that goes through the cliché plot line ploddingly . Dialogue is flat , as is the acting . The film is overly violent but completely bloodless - I hate when they edit an R-rated movie into a PG-13 rated movie . At least it's sometimes laughable . Try not to giggle every time Wolverine is on his knees , hands ( and claws ) spread , screaming " NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! " That happens four times in the story , and the movie flashes back to one of those times at least once , as well . There's hardly a good thing I can say about it . It's a stinker , probably the worst summer blockbuster since Van Helsing . Sorry , Mr . Jackman . I have nothing against you , but these two movies are beyond abysmal .
385611	391152	780608	4.0	Lame	Lame pot comedy about a girl ( Anna Farris ) who gets high , eats a bunch of cupcakes which , unbeknownst to her , have pot in them , and then becomes really , really high . The movie follows her as she stumbles about , trying to acquire more pot and then to pay off her dealer . But , being high and all , she doesn't quite have the gumption to get where she's going . There are definitely some funny moments , but in general it's never more than mildly amusing . And Farris , I think , overplays it a bit . I'm not a pothead myself , but I don't think most potheads would even find much to like about the movie . For one thing , Farris does not end up winning in the end . The message is clearly that drugs can get you into trouble . And I don't think that's something the film's intended audience really wants to hear . A big step down from Araki's previous film , Mysterious Skin .
385625	391152	372784	5.0	Mediocrity	A nice effort , I suppose , but a failure nonetheless . I actually prefer the first three installments of the 1980s & 1990s Batman franchise , though none of them are great movies , either . Tim Burton ? and even Joel Schumacher ? brought at least some vision into their Batman worlds . Nolan attempts to do this realistically ? that was the original idea , anyway ? but he is bogged down by screen writing and action movie clichés . There weren't half as many explosions in all four of the 90s Batman films combined . Batman Begins does little to deepen the story , as some critics have claimed . The backstory was told perfectly , and with great economy , in 1989's Batman . There was no emotion lost . Nolan takes nearly an hour to tell it , and he doesn't make it any more interesting . They didn't find a better actor to play Batman . Christian Bale is as dull as Keaton , Kilmer , and Clooney . The villains are uninteresting . Ra's Al Ghul ( which is mispronounced throughout the film ) has always been my least favorite of the Batman villains . Dr . Jonathan Crane , aka " the Scarecrow " is wonderfully played by Cillian Murphy when he's out of his mask , but he is supremely uninteresting when he's in it ( doesn't help that Nolan resorts to stupid distorted images and noise pollution whenever he puts the mask on ) . Katie Holmes is a wonderful actress in small projects , but , like Natalie Portman , she doesn't translate well to blockbusters . Plus , Tom Cruise just ruined her for me . Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkinson are horribly miscast ( Wilkinson as a mob boss ? ) . They actually might have just switched roles and it would have been better . The only things the film gets excessively right are Alfred and Lucius Fox , played by Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman . But , really , while these two consummate actors bring an air of class to this kiddy pool , they out-act both the hero and the villains to such an extent that it warps the movie . I really should not desire more scenes with the butler . I should add Liam Neeson to that , as well . He's very good , and perfectly cast . Batman Begins is often a good actioner , but it should have been much better .
385019	391152	475298	5.0	It's hilariously awful	Maybe the best bad movie of 2006 . It's an amateurish horror anthology hosted by Snoop Dogg . The stories are dumb and often nonsensical , but there's enough amusing stuff to make it worthwhile . Any movie where Snoop Dogg blows a chihuahua into smithereens or where a gangsta impales himself on his own forty has to be worth at least something ! The second segment of three ( not counting the terribly animated opening ) is by far the most entertaining , where a redneck trust fund kid , subtly named Tex Jr . and partly modeled after the President ( played by Anson Mount ) , has to move in with some old black veterans who served under his father in Vietnam . Mount's performance is as offensive as anything Stepin Fetchit could ever produce , but it's just so damn funny . Recognizable actors include Billy Dee Williams ( aka Lando Calrissian ) , Ernie Hudson ( aka Winston Zedmore , the black Ghostbuster ) , Danny Trejo ( the Columbian knife thrower from Desperado ) , Jason Alexander ( George from Seinfeld ) , Aries Spears ( a player on MAD TV ) and Lin Shaye ( the ugly woman from Kingpin and There's Something About Mary , and she's a surprisingly attractive older woman in real life , apparently ) . If you like bad movies , check it out when it hits video . If you actually want a watchable urban horror film , check out Tales from the Hood .
384631	391152	37514	5.0	One of Hollywood's worst musicals	Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra play sailors on leave who get mixed up with Kathryn Grayson . They promise her an audition with musical director José Iturbi ( playing himself ) in order to get her in good with Sinatra , but the two sailors are unable to procure such an audition . Predictably , Kelly begins to fall for Grayson instead , but , luckily , the second female lead ( Pamela Britton ) attracts Sinatra's attention . This was the first iteration of this formula , which was used again in the other Kelly / Sinatra pairings Take Me Out to the Ball Game and On the Town , but the other two films did it better . Yes , even Take Me Out to the Ball Game . The difference ? Ball Game wraps up its plot in an efficient 93 minutes , and has a few memorable songs ( along with several very unmemorable ones ) . Anchors Aweigh runs for two hours and twenty minutes with this hackneyed plot . The songs are more in line with Sinatra's early crooning days , and several of the musical numbers here consist of classical music ( not to knock classical music or anything , but it's just not what I want when watching a Hollywood musical ) . The film is best known for Gene Kelly's dance with MGM's Jerry the Mouse . That sequence is great . I also very much like the adorable Grayson , and the set design is often excellent . Otherwise , it's completely forgettable .
384784	391152	80736	5.0	Good concept , poorly executed	The kind of movie that has a pretty good idea at its center , but doesn't do all that much with it . That idea is that a modern day aircraft carrier runs into a wormhole and ends up in the Pacific on December 6th , 1941 . Should they stop the bombing of Pearl Harbor , or should they not reveal their presence , lest they change history ? Unfortunately , most of the movie consists of the characters figuring out what has happened , and no one really asks the kinds of important questions you'd think they would . The cast is good , including Kirk Douglas , Martin Sheen , Katharine Ross and Charles Durning , but none of them has much to do . Sheen in particular , what was the point of his character ? He adds little to the movie , except that he is Martin Sheen and Martin Sheen is pretty awesome . Just out of curiosity , I checked out Roger Ebert's review of the movie . Hilariously , he reveals the ending and every secret the movie has in the second paragraph . He also doesn't seem to understand the concept of time travel whatsoever . Was this like the first time travel movie ever ? He is right that it's not very good . I'd say more forgettable than bad , though .
385264	391152	1068649	5.0	French award bait that's pretty poorly written ( though , I admit , well performed )	You've got to be kidding me ! If this were an American film , it would be dismissed outright by many as Oscar bait . As it is now , it should be dismissed as Cesar bait . I think , if it were a French language film without the stunt casting of a famous English actress , it would also be dismissed . Anyhow , the point is , it should be dismissed . It's just not that good of a film . Yes , Kristen Scott Thomas is quite good as a woman recently released from prison after a 15 year stint . Elsa Zylberstein , playing the little sister who was forced by her parents to forget about Thomas , is actually quite a bit better . But , yeah , between those two , the film doesn't lack in the acting department . But the script ! Oh , the script ! The film would be good or great if it were all about the relationship between the two sisters . It's definitely at its best when it concentrates on relationships . The screenplay is so awful , though . Claudel writes it as an ongoing mystery . First it's " Where has this woman been ? " That lasts for about ten minutes . After that the mystery is , " What has she done ? " This is left untold for about thirty minutes . And then comes the big one , " Why ? " They keep that one covered up for the rest of the film . But that's pretty much the only thing you think about for ninety minutes . Even when the characters are growing , it's hard to care about anything else . I mean , after all , that " why " is going to go a long way toward understanding Thomas ' character . The fact is , when you do actually find out " why " , it's extremely dumb , as well as completely unbelievable . But I would have been bothered even if Thomas ' " why " had been good . The structure of the film is rather annoying . By the end , the film feels like a complete waste .
385975	391152	831887	5.0	I should rate it lower , but it has a couple of things going for it that make it watchable , at least	There might be a movement in the future to turn this box office bomb into a cult classic , but it doesn't deserve that . Much in the style of Robert Rodriguez's Sin City , but different enough not to feel like a cheap imitation , The Spirit does look cool . The images are often gorgeous . Add to that a number of pretty women , notably Eva Mendes and Scarlett Johansson , and it's almost worth watching with the sound off . But then you'd miss Sam Jackson's hammy villain , which is fun enough . But after the look and Jackson , there's nothing worth seeing . Miller infamously got a directing credit for Sin City because Rodriguez felt he followed the comic book so literally it would be wrong not to . But Miller here finds that storyboarding is not the same as directing . His tone is all over the place . He's going for over-the-top comic book-style camp , and it works occasionally . More frequently it flops on the ground like a suffocating carp . Miller also doesn't properly establish who any of his characters are , and , especially nearer the beginning , it's difficult to follow the plot . Most of the fault is surely Miller's ( I've also heard that fans of the original Eisner work feel like Miller has put too much of his stamp on the work ) , but the editor is probably partly at fault , too , for the confusion . It's extraordinarily sloppy , but I was carried along enough by the art work enough where I can't rate it too low .
384866	391152	104779	5.0	Weak in pretty much every way	If Polanski has made a worse film , I haven't yet seen it and don't want to . The story is dull and fairly common . It's about the tempestuous relationship between two lovers ( Peter Coyote and Emmanuelle Seigner ) who meet in Paris . At first things are beautiful between them , but over time the relationship deteriorates and becomes abusive . The story actually takes place quite a time after that , when Coyote , now paralyzed , is telling their story to Hugh Grant on a cruise ship . Grant is madly attracted to Seigner , which annoys his wife , Kristin Scott Thomas . I think the worst thing about the film is the casting . Peter Coyote is fine in supporting roles , but he's not a strong enough actor to carry this film . James Woods was originally cast , and he would have been a lot better ( though I doubt he would have been able to make it a good movie ) . I absolutely despise Hugh Grant . Completely talentless , and utterly unable to carry dramatic roles like this one . Emmanuelle Seigner , Polanski's wife , is sultry but not much of an actress . Only Kristin Scott Thomas among the four is reliable , and she's given by far the least to do . Even Victor Bannerjee , whom you may remember as the lead in Lean's A Pasage to India , has more to do than her ( and may just give the best performance in the film , with about five minutes of screen time ) . The film didn't offend me with its sheer terribleness or anything like that . It's just imminently forgettable .
384586	391152	1155056	5.0	Mediocre comedy	I could easily sum up my feelings on this one in three words : Not Enough Laughs . But I'll go a little further , ' cause I know that's hardly satisfying . Paul Rudd is a newly engaged man who realizes that he doesn't have any male friends . Where his future wife has seven brides maids , he hasn't a groomsman to his name , let alone a Best Man . The film plays like a romance , except it's about a guy looking for a guy friend . It even ends with his guy friend rushing to the wedding . The guy he finds is Jason Segel , who , for the first time , gets Rudd to act like a guy . Which , of course , ends up upsetting his wife-to-be . Everything's very predictable here . But , I'll say it again , it would all be forgivable if there were laughs . There are some , but never big ones . I might be more forgiving if it weren't for the bevy of fantastic comedies we've had in the past few years . Last year alone there was Forgetting Sarah Marshall , Step Brothers and Pineapple Express . Those three are enough to keep you laughing for weeks , and you remember the laughs . So many laughs , in fact , that after I saw each of those films I forgot many of those laughs . Not because they were forgettable , but because other big laughs replaced the first laughs ! Nothing at all like that here . For the first time in a while , at least among the other films made by the actors featured in this film , almost all of the good moments were in the commercials . And , I must add , this film must set a record for the biggest waste of a great cast : Jaime Pressly , Jane Curtin , J . K . Simmons , Andy Sandberg , Joe Lo Truglio and Thomas Lennon appear . Most of them get a joke or two ( except Curtin ? why cast Jane Curtin and not give her one gag ? ) , but with all those great comedians , you want more .
385646	391152	104237	5.0	Last Lambada in London	This is a huge misfire by a great director . In fact , I have seen many , many Malle films and have given four of them 10s , two 9s , and an 8 . That's a great average now brought down considerably by the 5 I'm giving this film . And , truth be told , it isn't a bad film . It's just uneventful . A movie about a man who falls in love with his son's fiancee just isn't all that shocking , at least in the movies . It might have worked if the characters were better developed . Anna ( Juliette Binoche ) is given a compelling background story , but it is not well used by the script , the direction , or the actress . And it pains me to say so , because I am in LOVE with Juliette Binoche . Stephen , the main character , played by Jeremy Irons , is even less well off . We learn nothing at all about him . His lust comes about almost immediate ( which isn't hard to understand : we're talking about BINOCHE here ) , but we are not given any real reason to believe that he would so quickly betray his son and his wife . Martyn ( Rupert Graves ) is the cuckolded son . He has a nice speech about the disappointments he had as a rich child , but that isn't enough to give his character any weight . Slightly better off is Miranda Richardson as Ingrid , Stephen's bored wife . She plays her upper class fears well as she has to deal with the newcomer Anna , who seems suspicious to her . She also has a good scene at the end when she confronts her husband . The one character whom I did find interesting is Sally , the teenage daughter . Through the film , she silently develops and loses a relationship with a boy . It is almost a parody of the seriousness of the two older men's relationship with Anna . We see Sally and her new boyfriend several times together , but he always has headphones on and they never talk to each other ( the adults never seem to talk to their lovers , either ) . Surely , if some more tension had been injected into the mix , or just anything else to get the audience to think about something , it could have been good . As it is , it's a dud . Instead , see some of its precursors : especially Last Tango in Paris , which is the kind of movie that can draw you in . I'd even suggest these two exploitation flicks as alternatives : In the Realm of the Senses ( Japanese : Ai no corrida ) and The Night Porter ( which I think is either a French or Italian film , but I happened to have seen it dubbed into English ) . Those films have the ability to entertain you a little , unlike Damage .
384718	391152	112817	6.0	The long awaited reviewing of a movie I've often trashed	I'm only somewhat happy to say that it's nowhere near as bad as I remembered it ? I rated it a dismal after just one viewing . Since I first saw it , probably around a decade ago , I've educated myself in both Westerns and Jarmusch , and I can judge it better being more familiar with its referents . My judgment now : still not very good . To be fair , I can't say that I'm the biggest Jarmusch fan . I've seen most of his movies now , and the only one that works for me on any large level is his most recent , Broken Flowers . That film just blows me away . Other than that , I did like Mystery Train . All of the other films I've seen of his , which include Coffee and Cigarettes , Down by Law , Stranger Than Paradise and Dead Man itself , work for me up to a point . After that point , they just bug me . My specific complaint about Dead Man is that it seems to want to be profound , or at least people think it is ( the lead comment on IMDb right now begins : " A profoundly spiritual film speaking to our true human nature in a world of illusion " ) , but it also wants to be a goofy / weird comedy . That goofiness is fun at times , but definitely kills any apparent profundity . And , dammit , how can anyone take it the least bit seriously with that damn fat Indian ? I hate the character of Nobody , and hate Gary Farmer's performance . If it weren't for him , I think I'd like the film . I like a lot about it . First and foremost , the cinematography is outstanding . I also love the quirky costume design . And the supporting performances are fun . I personally don't think Jarmusch is trying to be profound at all . I think the goofiness was more of his intention . In that case , it would have been better if it had been trimmed a bit . This is his longest film , I think , and , even besides Nobody , it overstays its welcome . While I don't hate it anymore , this is certainly my least favorite of Jarmusch's films .
384548	391152	177971	6.0	The one thing I never want to hear while in a helicopter : " We're running on fumes here . "	It's difficult to gage whether or not _ The Perfect Storm _ is worth seeing . On the negative side , the film contains about the most generic and stock characters and situations one will find in Hollywood . The actors in this film , most of whom are normally great , obviously did this just for the big pay check so that they could star in more Magnolias and Three Kings . But on the positive side , it contains some extremely exciting and physically harrowing scenes . From a technical point of view , it might be the most well done sea disaster film ever made . Whatever happens , don't decide to wait for video to see this film . Even on DVD , it would not be very fun to watch . These waves simply have to be over your head to enjoy this film . See it at a matinee . I paid $3 . 50 to see it , and I'm perfectly happy about that price . And after you watch it , if you do think it's something great , go out and rent _ The Poseidon Adventure _ , which , while the special effects don't reach anywhere near this level , I feel is the best disaster movie I've ever seen . I give _ The Perfect Storm _ .
384956	391152	32258	6.0	Silly , but moderately entertaining	Though this film is found on DVD in a Bela Lugosi box set , Lugosi has a supporting role . Boris Karloff is also in it in a much more major role , but the star is character actor Stanley Ridges . The fact is , Karloff was supposed to be in the Ridges part and Lugosi in the Karloff part , but Karloff was considered unconvincing in the dual role . Ridges plays a college professor who is harmed during a gangland shooting . Also injured is a gang boss , Red Cannon . Cannon is dying , as is the English professor , so Boris Karloff transplants half of Cannon's brain into the prof's head , which helps him survive . Later on , the prof starts exhibiting memories of Red Cannon . Karloff attempts to use that subliminal knowledge to get hidden gangster money . Unfortunately , the subliminal soon becomes the conscious . It's a moderately entertaining story . The wrap-around story kind of ruins it ? the movie begins with Karloff about to be executed , and then the main thrust of the story is told in flashback . But when we get to why Karloff is about to be executed , it's just stupid .
385105	391152	63414	6.0	Now on DVD from No Shame	Bertolucci was heavily indebted to Godard and the other French New Wave directors in his sophomore feature , Before the Revolution . His third feature , Partner , has him follow Godard into his fin de cinema . Partner is a purely experimental film with little narrative . It's definitely a turn for the worst for Bertolucci . Thankfully he was drawn back into narrative cinema with his fourth film , The Conformist . Partner is worth seeing for fans of the director and New Wave enthusiasts . It has some interesting points . The minimal plot of the film has Pierre Clémenti playing a man with split personalities . Most of the rest of it is made up of random vignettes . Some are amusing , some are annoying . Some are just plain boring . Unfortunately , there just aren't enough amusing ones to make it an easy watch . Clémenti is excellent , and Bertolucci lives up to his reputation as one of the cinema's greatest visual minds . Stefania Sandrelli , who would go on to star in The Conformist , appears briefly with curly blonde hair . She doesn't do much , but she's gorgeous .
384867	391152	348150	6.0	Not terrible , but certainly forgettable	Fairly entertaining , but entirely unmemorable . Superman returns from exploring the wastes of his home planet , Krypton , to learn that Lois has a kid and a live-in boyfriend . Meanwhile , Lex Luthor has been released from prison and has invaded the Fortress of Solitude in order to steal Kryptonian technology . The plot from there more or less writes itself . Too bad it also doesn't edit itself , as the film lasts over two and a half hours . The cast is mostly generic . Brandon Routh seems weak , but that's probably not his fault . The screenwriters have written little for him to do . Kate Bosworth is pretty but doesn't strike me as the Lois Lane type . Only Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor gives anything close to a good performance . He pales in comparison to Gene Hackman , but he has some very good moments . I absolutely hate that little moppet who plays Lois ' kid . He's in desperate need of a haircut . The action sequences are mostly enjoyable , although they cross far into the territory of ridiculous . I read an article shortly before the release of the film that said the film pays closer attention to science than previous Superman movies . Perhaps ? the climactic sequence of the ' 78 Superman is one of the most ludicrous moments in cinema history . But the first action sequence , in which Superman saves a doomed plane and no one , given real world physics , would have survived , is nearly as bad .
385901	391152	18045	6.0	Dull silent epic with some standout moments	Divided into two parts , the first half is okay , if generally unremarkable . It concerns a group of Polish people rebelling against the Russians , who are dominating them . The second half is mostly painful to sit through . The leader of the Polish rebels , Boleslas ( Pierre Blanchar ) , is disguised as an undefeatable robotic chess player , designed by Baron von Kempelen ( Charles Dullin ) , who is famous for his automatons . When the automaton faces the Empress of Russia , Catherine II , she cheats to see what her opponent will do . He responds by swiping the pieces off the chess board . The Empress finds it amusing , but orders the automaton to be shot . The film is way overlong ( imdb lists under 90 minutes , but the Milestone DVD runs 139 ) , and the story and themes are convoluted . Like a lot of overambitious silent films , its far too many characters are easy to confuse . I was quite bored through the film . There were several great moments , though . The battle scenes in the first half are exceptional . Bernard uses some sort of handheld camera to make it seem like the viewer is in the battle . It's a common technique nowadays , but I can't recall seeing it earlier than 1927 . This has to be at least one of the first times when this was done . The cinematography is generally good , and often great , especially in the first half . Although the second half is hard to sit through , there is an extended sequence where one character is caught in the middle of a group of Baron von Kempelen's automaton soldiers . I didn't even really know who this character was exactly , but it was a neat scene .
384723	391152	427944	6.0	Actually not that good at all . A weak satire , but do see it for the performances . Rob Lowe & Adam Brody should be nominated for Oscars ( though they certainly won't be ) .	Satire about a tobacco lobbyist ( Aaron Eckhart ) . I can't quite put my finger on why , but I really didn't think it worked . Admittedly , the tobacco industry is an easy target . It would be too easy to villainize Nick Naylor , so it feels kind of like they were trying not to villainize him completely . Which then feels like they were being too soft on him . I mean , isn't he a villain ? It always felt like director / screenwriter Reitman was pulling his punches . The film is moderately entertaining . I actually wish it were a tad funnier , but there are a few really funny moments . Nick's visit to Hollywood is the best part of the film . Rob Lowe as a Hollywood agent and Adam Brody as his assistant give the movie's most memorable performances , and also deliver all the best lines . I also liked Maria Bello and David Koechner as Nick's friends , lobbyists for alcohol and firearms respectively . William H . Macy is also good as an anti-smoking senator , but it makes me question Reitman's intentions that the satirical barbs at him stick much better than the ones against the tobacco industry .
384850	391152	53137	6.0	" Waltzing Mathilda " is such a beautiful song	And On the Beach is probably the only thing that could make one sick of hearing it . This film is about the impending nuclear destruction of Australia . The rest of the world is already gone . We spend the last few months of life on Earth in the company of a navy man and his wife ( Anthony Perkins and Donna Anderson ) , their sister ( Ava Gardner ) , a scientist with a guilty conscience ( Fred Astaire ) , and an American sub captain whose family died ( Gregory Peck ) . By the film's end , only one of these characters appeared human to me , the one played by Anthony Perkins . The rest seemed underdeveloped . Most of the fault rests in a morbid desire for melodrama . Just how many Gone With the Wind style kisses do we need to see between Peck and Gardner ? Little with the human characters rings true . And whatever power there could be in the film is absolutely ruined by the constant score . It never knows what it is doing , and it is too strong almost everywhere you hear it . Silence goes a long way , and the couple of scenes where there is silence , especially the scene where Perkins talks to his wife for the last time ( although the music does eventually crop up there , too ) , are powerful . And it's not just that the film is dated . I can deal with dating . It's just not a very well made film to begin with . All the great films that deal with this subject are science fiction , and I suppose that , since sci-fi is never taken seriously enough , this was provided as an alternative . Dr . Strangelove does a lot more to show us the absurdity of nuclear war . Maybe the best anti-nuclear sci-fi was made before this , The Day the Earth Stood Still . The best film that shows both the absurdity of nuclear war and the absurdity of the human race in general would not come for 9 years , but when it did it would be called Planet of the Apes , a much maligned film which ought to be considered one of the best ever made . On the Beach should not .
384554	391152	94606	6.0	Unsatisfied with this acclaimed drama	Strange , unsatisfying drama with a tinge of quirky comedy . I don't know , it didn't do too much for me . At first , I was infuriated . It felt forced and the dialogue felt so utterly written . It almost felt like the actors were reading the book out loud . I half expected Kathleen Turner to end some of her sentences with " she said " . It does have an interesting message , one that everyone needs to take to heart , that it's very easy to get addicted to routines and never change your life , even when it might be much better to change it . I started to warm to it after a while , but I never crossed the line into liking it . There was one aspect about it that I really liked , though : the musical score by John Williams . Very subtle , not overused . Everything we generally wouldn't expect from John Williams .
385195	391152	81353	6.0	Below average Altman , but still interesting	This film , generally considered one of Altman's greatest follies , is not all that bad . Unfortunately , it's not all that good , either . The director , along with his production team have created a unique and amazing world in Sweethaven , populated by bizarre and amusing live-action cartoon characters . It's an awesome film just to look at . Unfortunately , the script is very weak . I wonder if Altman insisted upon his regular method of film-making , in coming up with a lot of it on the spot , having his actors create the scenes . It feels like there was at least some level of improvisation , and it doesn't work because these characters are all two-dimensional cartoons . Neither Altman nor the actors are ever able to convince that these people are real , even in their fantasy world . When asked to improvise , I imagine the actors had a hard time imagining what their characters ' motivations were , as there's not much psychology in your average Popeye cartoon . A lot of the characters ' interactions consist of moaning , shouting and jumping up and down angrily and it gets annoying . The film might also have worked better if the music were better . Harry Nilsson's songs are almost all poor , except for the two performed by Shelley Duvall , perhaps only because Duvall's Olive Oyl voice sounds so good in song ( remember how brilliantly P . T . Anderson used the song " He Needs Me " in Punch-Drunk Love a few years ago ) . The movie must work in some capacity , though : I absolutely adored it when I was a kid , and watched it numerous times on television . This isn't the disaster it's often touted as , but it's definitely one of Altman's failures .
385090	391152	60304	6.0	The least successful Godard film I've seen , and I've seen more than a dozen others	Although it was a critical success when it was released , and it still has strong supporters today , I personally found Two or Three Things I Know About Her a very weak film . It represents a day in the life of a prostitute / housewife , though that itself is difficult to tell . The film is rather amorphous . Maybe that's a word that many would use to describe the whole of Godard's films . But almost all of his other films , with the possible exception of Alphaville and Contempt ( both of which I need to see again , having not seen them for a few years ) , have a little more internal structure and , what is especially missing from Two or Three Things , a pace . Other films of his are also more biting in their satire or drama , depending on what Godard is going for . Two or Three Things is dead in the water . Think of the giddy quickness and insanity of Pierrot le fou or Le Week-End , or the frightening images of Le petit soldat or Vivre sa vie . This film is not worthless , however . I've never seen a Godard film that I would call bad . And it is , like all of his films ( I also haven't seen one that any fan should miss ) , important in his development as a director . You can see Le Week-End about to burst out of the screen . Two or Three Things contains a couple of remarkable scenes , including the coffee scene . Godard narrates in a whisper , philosophizing over his own role in the universe , as creme swirls in a cup of coffee and clusters of bubbles rotate and pop ( the camera is so close that you can't see anything but the coffee in the cup ) . The cinematography in general , by Godard's frequent collaborator Raoul Coutard , is quite good . I especially like the shots of construction equipment , cranes and such . They're kind of like the opposite of Yasujiro Ozu's pillow shots . .
384731	391152	20620	6.0	Yes , it is bad , but . . .	I think it qualifies as a must-see film for all true scholars of the cinema . That is not to say that it is a good film . It is most certainly not . But this is really a perfect film in which to study the biggest change that this artistic medium ever experienced , the change from silence to sound . The whole film comes off as so , so awkward . It doesn't help that the script is awful . The film is actually over-ambitious , trying hard to cover the entire life of Abe , from birth to death . However bad Abraham Lincoln is , though , I myself found it more than watchable and always fascinating . .
384786	391152	499448	7.0	No Lord of the Rings , but probably a tad better than the first Chronicle of Narnia	I went into this with low expectations , and they were exceeded . I liked it quite a bit , perhaps more than the first film in this series , The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe . I think it's because the religious allegory is much more subtle . I also liked the plot line of royal intrigue and power struggles , which is always a favorite subject of mine . The first time around , I said that the film's main success was the casting of four kids who could act , and that statement holds up perfectly here . Georgie Henley , Skandar Keynes , William Moseley and Anna Popplewell are all great as the Pevensie children , and each of them has their moments to shine . Ben Barnes is the newcomer , Prince Caspian , and is not nearly as successful . He's a pretty but dull boy . Sergio Castellitto makes a good villain , though , and Peter Dinklage and Warwick Davis are good as Narnian dwarfs . There are at least two set-pieces that beat anything from the first film , the night raid on Castellitto's castle and Caspian's attempt to summon the Ice Witch ( Tilda Swinton , in a brief cameo ) . The story ends kind of weakly , with an almost literal deus ex machina . And the fact that Caspian's subjects are overjoyed at his return , despite the fact that their families have been decimated by him in the previous day's battle , bothered me . The next installment of the novels , The Voyage of the Dawn Treader , was my favorite of the seven , so I hope they continue to improve .
385319	391152	63205	7.0	Good , not great film from the Japanese New Wave	The story involves four people whose work is blackmail . They're successful in their " business , " but their eyes eventually get too big for their stomachs when they think they've found a way to rip off the yakuza . The job proves harder than the easy money it initially seemed . While it is generally well done , its techniques reminded me a little too much of the annoying modern style with a lot of unnecessary freeze frames , chronological jumps , and shifts from black and white to color . I also felt that the characters ought to have been more well developed ; the story is good , but the style overwhelms possible substance . My favorite part of the film is the fact that the characters whistle the theme tune to Suzuki Seijun's Tokyo Drifter , which means that Suzuki had to have had some popularity if his work was quoted like this . .
385781	391152	93409	7.0	Hardly a classic , but a good piece of entertainment	A major piece of modern pop culture that I had not yet experienced . Now I can finally get all the references , parodies , rip-offs and trivia questions . And I can finally put Lethal Weapon 4 , which for some reason I watched back when it came out on DVD , in context . Maybe I should give it another watch now , but my intuition tells me it still sucks . Truth be told , Lethal Weapon 1 isn't an especially good movie , either , though the final installment ( so far ! ) makes it look like a masterpiece . Mel Gibson and Danny Glover play chatterbox cops who are total opposites in life and style but , of course , are made partners . This probably wasn't the first buddy cop movie , but it is the most influential . Shane Black , who later went on to write and direct the superior Kiss Kiss Bang Bang , wrote a sometimes witty script which is also often ridiculous , repetitive , convoluted and just plain dumb . Richard Donner is one of the best popcorn directors , but a lot of Lethal Weapon feels overstuffed to me . There's just too much going on in many scenes , and the exaggerated performances of the two leads , along with their rapid-fire and frequently incomprehensible dialogue , I was getting a tad annoyed . But never that annoyed . With all its flaws , Lethal Weapon is nothing less than a good bit of entertainment . It's not a film you want to think too much about , but it's also not a film that really invites you to think about it too much , either .
385865	391152	37059	7.0	A bit overrated	A very sweet musical starring Judy Garland . The plot concerns a family living in St . Louis whose patriarch has accepted a job in New York City . His family is devastated . The two oldest daughters both have beaus , and the oldest son has a girl as well . The plot is passable . If it weren't for the exceptional songs , the film would have been almost entirely forgettable . Even as it is , I doubt I'll remember much beyond " The Trolley Song " tomorrow morning . It shoots itself in the foot ; all but one of the songs are front-loaded onto the first half of the film , with only one ( albeit a great one , " Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas " ) occurring in the last fifty minutes . Because of this , the film often seems uneven . Although Meet Me in St . Louis is one of the best remembered of the classic era of musicals , Minnelli made many better films . He's only able to pull a couple of non-musical rabbits out of his hat . As for the acting , it's decent . Judy Garland is as beautiful as ever , but I found her character fairly uninteresting . Just another one of those musical heroines who wants nothing more than to be courted . The biggest joy of the film comes from the two youngest daughters , played wonderfully by Joan Carroll and Margaret O'Brien ( the latter won a special - and much deserved - Oscar for best child actress of the year ) . Together they have a morbid fascination with death and murder , a touch that might have been more at place in a Hitchcock film . Well , it still works wonders here ! .
385269	391152	303658	7.0	Certainly one of Miike's lesser films	Even if , in the future , he becomes the world's most beloved director and everyone everywhere seeks out all his films , Andromedia will be forgotten . There's really no such thing as " typical Miike " , but this film is somehow definitely atypical Miike . It's a teeny cyber-thriller that stars not one , but two Japanese teen pop groups , Speed and Da Pump , both of which get a song . Da Pump , the boy band , even gets their own music video in the middle of the movie for no good reason . So , yeah , it's kind of corny , but it's corny in a fun way . And it's just fun to see Miike do this kind of pap . The film's villains ? whose motives we never really understand ? are goofy and entertaining , especially Christopher Doyle , best know as the cinematographer of Zhang Yimou's Hero , who plays a shorts-wearing evil corporate guy from Detroit . He looks like he was downloaded from the mid-80s . Doyle even gets to dance during Da Pump's big musical number . So Andromedia's not half bad if you can take a bit of goofiness .
384902	391152	120831	7.0	Good but sloppy	After falling in love with Tamara Jenkins ' sophomore feature , The Savages , a short while back , I have finally caught up with her debut . It's pretty obviously a first film . Jenkins has created some memorable characters and some good situations , most certainly culled from real-life experiences . But the story arc is pretty weak . The film is at its best when concentrating on its protagonist , Viv , played by the wonderful Natasha Lyonne . She's a great character , the kind that reminds me of how few well developed female characters there are in movies . I also liked Marisa Tomei's character , too , for the same reason . The men are considerably less interesting , and there are almost too many of them . I've never been a fan of Alan Arkin , so it was hard to overcome that prejudice here . He's kind of a despicable character , and it was hard for me to sympathize with Viv's unconditional love for her father . It doesn't help that Jenkins fails to resolve the father character's major transgression in the last part of the film , instead just dismissing it . Jenkins also bombs most of her set-pieces , and a lot of the scenes she tries to end on laughs are duds . And the jaunty score really needed to be dropped . The movie is not nearly as cheerful as the music seems to think it is . Overall , I liked the movie . But I am impressed that Jenkins could create the perfection of The Savages after a sloppy debut and nine years off . That makes her sophomore feature even more impressive .
385757	391152	457572	7.0	Great idea , so-so results	In a 1950's style America , humanity has survived the zombie apocalypse , which happened much as it did in Romero's Night of the Living Dead , and is now living safe inside fenced-in safe zones . There is an invention , a collar of some sort , that is able to quell the zombies ' hunger for human flesh . Now they are used as servants , or , in some cases , pets . Fido is the Lassie of zombies . He even belongs to a boy named Timmy . Unfortunately , as tame as the zombies are , the collars don't always work so well . Timmy and Fido get into trouble when the collar gets turned off , and zombie mayhem begins . The concept is gold , but I don't think co-writer / director Andrew Currie produces anything that interesting . His film-making is often sloppy . It sometimes feels like he spent all his budget on some vintage autos and an unnecessary helicopter shot . The zombie makeup looks terrible , which is always distracting . And the zombie actors are generally awful , probably on account of Currie's direction . They all seem too expressive in their faces and eyes . There are a lot of interesting aspects of this post-apocalyptic society , but the world and its rules are never adequately explained . To boot , it's difficult to understand some of the backstories , especially that of the father ( played by Dylan Baker ) . I'd still give a slight recommendation , just because the idea is so fantastic . And it's an amusing picture , even if it disappoints .
385148	391152	65492	7.0	Robert Altman proves to be no Maestro	Robert Altman is undoubtedly one of the best American directors of all time , but he very often missteps . Remember Popeye ? Well , Brewster McCloud , his first effort post-MASH , his enormous hit and Oscar winner , shouldn't really be considered a misstep , per se . It certainly is an interesting film . It's just that Altman never knows when to stop , and by the end , I couldn't wait for it to end . The first hour is hilarious . It's original , even for Altman it is unique . But after about an hour , there's this fifteen or so minute car chase that's just lame . There have been hundreds of car chases in film history , and only about three have been exciting , all three of those being in the Mad Max series . This one goes on and on . I can give it one complement , or insult , however you might see it . It predicts The Dukes of Hazzard . Several cop cars chase around an orange muscle car . This car chase kills whatever mood has been growing . Also , the film is just too dang clever for its own good . Cleverness is a good thing in the movies , because you see so little of it . But when a film is trying to be so different that it just becomes silly , well , like I said above , you just have to know when to stop . Altman ends with what seems to be an ode to Fellini's 8 . During that circus , the reason that the audience's emotions are so high is because you know and love the characters who are dancing around . Here , they're all just caricatures . I shouldn't be so hard on it . To tell you the truth , I liked it for a very long time . The film itself took too many missteps , and ended much more poorly than it had began .
385362	391152	449088	7.0	Moves along a bit too slowly to be as good as the first two	A disappointment , although definitely pretty good . Certainly better than Spider-Man 3 . But that ain't saying much , now is it ? Basically , At World's End carries over Dead Man's Chest's major problem of too much plot , but loses its virtue of breathless pacing . At World's End is far too slow at times , and it can be easy to get bored between setpieces . Which aren't , I should say , as good as those in either of the first two films . But , all in all , it isn't bad and it's still a lot of fun . Johnny Depp is as great as ever , and he , Geoffrey Rush , Naomie Harris and Bill Nighy's CGI face take part in an enormous ham-off . Personally , I think Rush won . As for the setpieces , the surreal , Being John Malkovich-inspired sequence in Davy Jones's locker is a lot of fun , and the climactic battle aboard the Flying Dutchman , though definitely a little too busy , is cracking .
385771	391152	74512	7.0	No , not great Hitchcock , but entertaining nonetheless	Family Plot differs from all the other Hitchcock films . It lacks suspense , for the most part , and it is not as funny as many of his films . Instead , it is just an amusing little yarn . I like the way the film starts with two separate plot lines which gradually merge . Even if it is not the most original thing in the world ( especially since two of Family Plot's stars were main players in Robert Altman's Nashville ) , it still makes the film interesting . If anyone else had made this film , it probably would be more fondly received by the public , although I doubt anyone would still be watching it today . The two characters with whom we begin the film , whom we would consider the heroes , are the best , and are played lovingly by Barbara Harris and Bruce Dern . She's a hack psychic milking old ladies out of pensions , and he's a cabbie who cannot find enough time both to drive his cab and participate in Harris ' schemes . Although the characters aren't as well developed as those in numerous other Hitchcock ventures , they're entertaining . The other couple , Karen Black and William Devane , fare less well . They're more crafty in their crimes , perpetrating large-scale kidnappings for enormous ransoms . Karen Black's character is very underdeveloped , hardly showing any depth . What character she does have is not entirely believable , since Karen Black seems too nice to play a hardcore criminal . William Devane is decent as the sinister mastermind , but the history provided to his character is far more brutal than is believable ( he locked his adopted parents in their bedroom and set fire to their house ) . I liked the idea of the small time crooks clashing with the professionals , and I liked the outcome of the film . All in all , it is decent and worth watching . It does not feel anything like a Hitchcock film , so I wouldn't expect anything like Vertigo or Rear Window when approaching this , his swan song .
384815	391152	71737	7.0	If nothing else , it's probably the only French New Wave film that begins with a decapitation !	I'm still inching into the cinema of Robert Bresson , as I would a hot bath . I saw Pickpocket a couple of months ago . I liked it , but didn't agree that it was a masterpiece of any sort . I picked up Lancelot of the Lake because the video box caught my eye . I didn't expect a French New Wave guy to be directing Medieval drama ( I also rented Rohmer's Perceval at the same time , but have not yet watched it ) , especially Bresson , whom I associate with a certain slowness . The result is mixed . The film is certainly not entirely successful , but I'd say that it is an extraordinarily interesting film . I have a problem with his decision to erase all emotion from his actors . That works decently in Pickpocket , but not as well here . The story takes place after the Knights of the Round Table have failed to find the Holy Grail . They return defeated . They feel that they have been denied by God himself . And then they begin to doubt themselves , and eventually to turn against each other . The story is one that ought to be imbued with emotions , especially Lancelot and Guinivere . Also , Lancelot's enemies , who are jealous of his affair with the queen more than they are angry on King Arthur's behalf , their rivalry should be readable on their faces . Instead , the actors emote about as much as cardboard cutouts . I guess Bresson is going for naturalism , but he falls way below that mark . Real people have emotions . On the other hand , Robert Bresson's direction , that is , everything but the acting , is excellent . Most everything works , and there are many masterful sequences . It's perfectly paced ( well , that is , if you like his style ) . The editing is often amazing . The art direction and music are also very good . As for the script , well , it can sometimes be confusing . Once in a while , I got a bit lost . But most of it works really well . .
384764	391152	37820	7.0	Merely okay	Not the best of the Val Lewton horror series , but it has its moments . When I think about it , the plot seems very good . A small group of people quarantine themselves on a small Greek island when they discover that one of them has the plague . Boris Karloff stars as a Greek general who becomes cruel when trying to keep order . After the army doctor dies , he becomes superstitious along the lines of an old woman who is also on the island . Somehow , the characters and the situation never come off especially well . It's never bad , but it's never great , either . The finale is quite effective , however . .
384675	391152	58450	7.0	Good , but not Marvelous	I liked the Umbrellas of Cherbourg , but was acutely aware that it was gimmicky . The American musicals of the 1950s obviously influenced this film quite a bit , and that genre was already nearly dead in the world as filmmaking began to move into the more artistic ( American ) films of the 1960s , like Bonnie and Clyde or Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid . The gimmick , to have every line , no matter how mundane , sung by the actors , is interesting at first , but after about 30 minutes , it gets old . The music is never all that great in the first place , and it is really repetitive . Also , the actors aren't very good singers . What I did like was the art direction and the costumes . The color schemes are very interesting throughout the film . But even this , the best part of the film , owes a lot of debt to the American musicals of the 1950s , especially An American in Paris and Singin ' in the Rain . Remember the color schemes in the extended " musical number " sequence near the end of Singing in the Rain where Gene Kelly proposes the grand finale of the film they are making ? It involves a goofily dressed Kelly trying to find a job as a dancer . Especially memorable in this scene is his dance with Cyd Charisse , decked in a gorgeous green flapper dress . Basically , the Umbrellas of Cherbourg constantly looks like it takes place in the same world as that scene in Singin ' in the Rain . I would suggest renting those two films before The Umbrellas of Cherbourg . And if you want a French musical , I suggest Le Million . As for the rest of the movie , i . e . , the plot , the dialogue , etc . , it is extraordinarily light . It is very two-dimensional and it is instantly forgettable . It isn't very romantic , and it is very predictable . It reminded me a bit of Elia Kazan's Splendor in the Grass in its plot , but it doesn't produce the same feelings in me that Splendor did . All in all , I would still recommend it if you're a lover of world cinema , but I'd just warn you not to expect the masterpiece that it is often touted as . I give it a .
385351	391152	464105	7.0	Good effort , but the results are somewhat forgettable	There really aren't enough films made about the modern experience of immigrants in America . There's a huge vein to be mined there . Man Push Cart is a step in the right direction . This film follows a Pakistani immigrant in New York City who sells drinks and donuts from a push cart . He was a pop star in his native country , but is now reduced to nothing . It's a simple story , entertaining and moderately involving , told decently enough . Unfortunately , when you step back and look at it , it's all pretty vapid . Director Bahrani clearly aims for neorealism , even echoing The Bicycle Thieves at points , but the neorealist classics aren't nearly as simplistic as a lot of people tend to think . Here , the characters are two-dimensional , the situation is pretty shallow , and the distantly foreshadowed climactic event feels like a cheap ploy . I'd hardly call it a bad film , but I think much more could have been done with the subject .
385977	391152	22787	7.0	Great direction , but the lack of distinct characters makes it a bit of a bust	Amazingly well directed and produced WWI flick made in France . Bernard is an extremely talented director . Unfortunately , the film doesn't stand up too well compared to so many other WWI pictures , notably the earlier All Quiet on the Western Front and the later The Grand Illusion . What Wooden Crosses lacks is strong characters . About the only one who stands out from the rest is the " loudmouth " , as he is described bluntly by another solider . " There's one in every company , " he says ; or at least , I think he says that . If no one said that , someone probably should have . Instead , Bernard concentrates almost wholly on extremely long battle sequences . One lasts nearly 40 minutes . Great , but if I don't care about the characters , I'm not going to care much when one gets killed .
385840	391152	1125849	7.0	Too familiar in its story to be a really great movie	A small film about a big man . Mickey Rourke is , as you've certainly heard , outstanding as an aging wrestler who was famous back in the ' 80s and still plugs along at small events . Small those events may be , but they don't skip on the showmanship . One particularly brutal match rubs out the possibility of any more , and he has to take his life into perspective . He tries to reconnect with his estranged daughter ( Evan Rachel Wood ) and form a real relationship with a frequently-visited stripper ( Marisa Tomei ) . Frankly , my opinion of the film is lower than that of most who have seen it . When The Wrestler focuses on wrestling , it's spectacular . It's very detail-oriented , and you can just sense how much Rourke , the big lug , loves it . And the aforementioned brutal match is sure to be one of the most shocking things you'll see in any 2008 film . I rarely am disturbed by what I see in a movie , but I was wincing hard at it . When the plot kicks in , though , I just found it to be utterly predictable . It's made out of three basic clichés : the old pro who desperately wants to re-achieve his former glory , the family member connecting with an estranged family member and the sex worker unsure of whether she should cross the line between her profession and her feelings . I could never get very excited about it , because I felt I knew exactly where it was going and I never was wrong .
385841	391152	959337	7.0	Well acted and made , but it's really just a turgid melodrama	Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet star in this film about an unhappily married couple . When they met , they were idealistic youths , but when they arrive in the suburbs , he working in sales and she a housewife , life seems dreary . The film offers no new insights on marriage or life . It is set in the 1950s , so you might think it's like , say , Far from Heaven in that it attempts to exploit the inadequacies of an era so beloved by a certain group of our society . But , no , Revolutionary Road doesn't make much of its ' 50s setting . I think it wants to be more universally about marriage . It's set in the ' 50s , I think , so there's a better reason these two people who just plain dislike each other have to stay together . So , taking place in the 1950s actually dates the problems that these couple are having for the most part . The story just doesn't feel relevant to a modern audience . Or me , at least . The film isn't that bad in the end . The acting is quite good , especially from Kate Winslet . Though I am a big fan of Michael Shannon , I found his two scenes in the movie very poorly written , mostly concerning his character , who comes off as a mere plot tool rather than a real person . The film is very gorgeous to look at , thanks to Roger Deakins , and I liked Thomas Newton's score ( he provided an even better one for Wall-E earlier in 2008 ) .
384951	391152	855824	7.0	Probably my least favorite Tsai film , but still very good	This may be Tsai's first film set and made in his homeland of Malaysia , but he doesn't stray at all from Tsaiville . Which isn't much of a problem , really , if you're a fan of the director . Sure , we could complain that he's been hitting the same notes for eight features now , but there are artists in every medium that are like this . Either we get sick of it , or we like it and we stick with it . I'm sticking with Tsai . His moods and rhythms haunt my mind . He captures images like no other director , and he's definitely one auteur whose work you could identify from just one shot ( granted , you have about ten times as many frames in that one shot as you do in your average auteur's work ! ) . I Don't Want to Sleep Alone is probably my least favorite of all of his films ( all of which I've seen except his previous , The Wayward Cloud ? I've seen the first five minutes and am aching to finish it ) . This is mostly because I wasn't too sure what was going on through much of it . The plot seems to concern a young Chinese man ( played by Tsai's boytoy / regular Lee Kang-sheng ) who gets beaten senseless in Kuala Lumpur . A construction worker saves him and nurses him back to health , mostly with lustful intentions . But when the Chinese man is up and about , he goes off and sleeps with some women , which understandably pisses off his savior . Then there was a bunch of stuff I didn't quite understand , notably a guy in a coma ( also played by Lee Kang-sheng ) . A lot of my favorite shots involved that guy , but I'm not 100 % sure what was going on in that plot line . The images here are top notch , and though there is little dialogue , Tsai's use of sound ? and music ? is wonderful . Much as Tsai uses Taipei , Kuala Lumpur is an area of urban alienation . Late in the film smoke drifts over from a nearby Sumatran forest fire , covering the city with a thick haze . Many of the scenes are set in a crumbling building ( not quite sure what this was all about , really ) , which reminds me of the post-apocalyptic landscape in my favorite Tsai film , The Hole . I actually think I might have enjoyed this more had I watched it when I was less tired . Unfortunately , I'm not sure I want to give it another chance with the awful DVD , courtesy of Strand Releasing . It's cropped , for one thing . The image also looks a lot less crisp than any of Tsai's other films , though that may have been his stylistic choice this time around .
384594	391152	25523	7.0	Uneven melodrama , but it ends up being fairly good	Pauline Lord plays Mrs . Wiggs , a poor , single mother whose husband is supposedly up looking for gold in the Klondike . She has five children , one of whom is very sickly . They have almost no money and their landlord is about to give them the boot , but luckily a benevolent rich couple takes an interest in them . Sometimes the relationship between the Wiggs and these two works out well . The couple's deeds seem sincere most of the time . But at odd times their behavior seems , well , not reprehensible , exactly , but questionable . It's almost as if they're treating the Wiggs as pets . How should we feel when the woman , Lucy , brings them a couple of baskets containing Thanksgiving dinner . Nice , yes , but does Lucy really have to be wearing a $5000 outfit made almost exclusively of fox fur ? I suppose this element didn't mean anything to those who were suffering through the Depression : Lucy was nice and that's that . From this vantage point , though , I don't know ; my knee jerked a little . The melodrama kind of fades near the end as good ol ' W . C . Fields wanders into the picture . He plays a sort of a mail-order husband to Mrs . Wiggs ' neighbor , Ms . Hazy ( well played by Greed star Zasu Pitts ) . Fields is as humorous as ever , and there's a very amusing scene where the Wiggs family helps Ms . Hazy trick him into thinking she's a great cook . Donald Meek ( best known as the whiskey salesman from Stagecoach a few years later ) shows up in a quick role that doesn't work out too well . .
385887	391152	23876	8.0	Although not the best film of 1933 , certainly not an unworthy Best Picture winner	A sloppy but beautiful British family saga chronicling the lives of two families , the Marryots and the Bridges , the former upper class and the latter their servants , from the end of the 19th Century up to 1933 . A few major events are portrayed . At the beginning of the film , the patriarchs of the two families go off to fight the Boer War . Much later on in the film we experience WWI , and in between we see the Titanic sink . The film is filled to the brink with good characters , all of them being portrayed by very good actors , as well . There are a few very bad scenes , most notably the one on the Titanic ( I know it was an important event in this time period , but it's handled very poorly and predictably in the screenplay ) . The final speech , a necessary element in every film of this sub-genre , is particularly bad , too . The film ends during a worldwide depression , and there is a half-attempt to provide the audience with hope . Unfortunately , there is none to be found . I would have hated to be an audience member at this film in 1933 ! The many good scenes do far outweigh the bad ones , though . There are a couple that are really masterful . The very long montage that paints a portrait of WWI is gorgeously done , and appropriately harrowing . The scene in which the matriarch of the Marryot family watches her youngest son go off to war is exquisite . After he leaves , she attempts to light a cigarette . At that moment , a young nurse and a wounded man in a stretcher pass by ; the nurse lights a cigarette for the wounded man . The match goes out between the matriarch's fingers as she stares at them . This very economical scene expresses both the cold fear she has for her son and the ways in which the boundaries between the classes were fading . The theme of class in Cavalcade is important , although I wish it had been developed further . Early in the film , the Bridges family moves away and amasses something of a fortune of their own . As history marches on , we do see the class lines falter a bit . Cavalcade may actually have been an influence on none other than Jean Renoir , at least in The Grand Illusion . That film also deals with the melding of the classes as a result of wars . There is one scene in Cavalcade that is simply too close to one in The Grand Illusion to be a coincidence . A theater show is interrupted to announce that the Boer War is over and that the troops are coming back . Together , the audience members stand up and begin singing . It looks very much like the scene where the P . O . W . s sing " The Marseilles " in The Grand Illusion . .
384698	391152	50539	8.0	Lives up to its reputation as one of the best Sci-Fi movies of the ' 50s	If not for slow beginning , this would definitely be a great sci-fi adventure movie . As it is , it's certainly awesome enough in parts . When Scott Carey shrinks small enough that his pet cat is a danger , the movie becomes something of a masterpiece . Carey is knocked into the basement . His wife thinks the cat actually got him , so no one is looking for him . He must try to survive with the few items that are small enough for him to manipulate . A large spider roams the room looking for food . What Jack Arnold failed to do in Tarantula , he succeeds in doing here . This spider is damn frightening . I'm not really sure how I feel about the ponderous final sequence . I'm leaning toward not liking it very much . The strong scenes in the film are so good , though , I ended up really liking it .
384908	391152	112661	8.0	Great animated short	This is a very funny short . There is no dialogue , and the animation is quite unique - especially the way photographs of people are integrated into the animation ( possibly the greatest moment , the space chicken shoots his laser , hits a photo of a guy , and it turns out crooked , with the guy's hair standing straight up ) . It is too bad they had to go and make a stupid series out of this short . Cartoon Network is almost completely worthless . . . have to stay up until 4 AM to see anything good , otherwise we just get Cartoon Cartoons .
385564	391152	45907	8.0	Very amusing Mexican Bunuel !	Two streetcar conductors whose streetcar is set to be dismantled sneak into the station late one night to take it for one last spin . They spend all night and most of the next day having small adventured throughout Mexico City . Agustin Isunza is the film's standout as an old man , Papa Pinillos , who worked for the streetcar company most of his life . He was laid off a while back , but he does little with his time besides get on random streetcars to see if their drivers are competent . When he jumps on the 133 , he quickly realizes that it's stolen and he spends the rest of the film desperately trying to get the company to believe him . It's a fun movie and very charming . Not a necessary Bunuel film , but fans should certainly catch it . .
385033	391152	912592	8.0	An average documentary that excels because of an interesting subject	Not a particularly well done documentary ? the director doesn't get good enough footage to assemble a " complete " documentary , and it feels a little sloppy in the end . But Bar-Lev , whose second feature documentary this is , was lucky enough to chance upon an controversy that engages the audience nicely . I've certainly been thinking about it a lot for the past couple of days . The film is about a four year-old artist , Marla Olmstead , who took the art world by storm in 2005 with her amazingly sophisticated and beautiful abstract paintings . Marla's output produced a good $200 , 000 between ' 05 and ' 06 . Bar-Lev wanted to document this child prodigy , but in the middle of his time spent with the family , the infotainment show , just one of a host of television news shows that covered the story , broke the angle that Marla's father , an amateur painter himself , may have coached the girl . All Hell breaks loose , the parents become pariahs , and they look to Bar-Lev as a possible savior . Unfortunately for them , Bar-Lev , who all the time has been trying and failing to get film of Marla painting one of her " masterpieces " , is swayed by . It's a lot of fun to look at the evidence provided , to try to read the body language of the parents and try to read between the lines with them . You also have the issue about whether Marla herself was being exploited , which can raise a lot of debate . The film also works as an exploration of modern and abstract art . I myself am a fan of it , and I think there have been plenty of truly beautiful works of non-representational art . But , yeah , there are definitely paintings , some on display at an art auction going for millions of dollars in this film , where even I think the title of the documentary puts it perfectly . Most people are far less accepting than I . The film shows just how much the genre sticks in the craw of the general American public , and , in a sequence where the parents share a host of nasty e-mails with Bar-Lev , many seem just as angry that any of these paintings sold in the first place as they do that the paintings may be a sham . Even the segment angles itself as an attack on non-representational art . Also featured are clips of a John Stossel news documentary about abstract art that I remember seeing a while back that really got my goat and has literally been making me angry for years now . Like many documentaries , the film benefits greatly from its DVD extras , which include a 30 + minute followup ( which actually caused me to lose some sympathy for the parents ; I seemed to be one of the few people who watched this movie and sympathized with them ) , and a great 15 + minute defense of abstract art by New York Times art critic Michael Kimmelman .
384733	391152	243133	8.0	Quite good ;	The Coen Brothers have their place in the cinematic lexicon . They're the clever jokesters of the movies and have given us many great movies . However , I really wish they would evolve . Sure , their films are a lot of fun , but they generally end up as nothing more than an entertaining joke . Only two of their films , in my opinion , achieve anything more , Barton Fink and Fargo , but even they only walk a few steps past that line . The Man Who Wasn't There for a long time suggests that it might end up being the best Coen Brothers movie . It seems to have depth past the cynical parodies and absurdities . Unfortunately , after about one third of the film has past , it loses focus and runs towards easy jokes and cutesy quirks as if it were a burly man who almost revealed something about himself after a night of heavy drinking . In particular , the UFO subplot really should have been cut . And they didn't need the young pianist's seduction near the end . It felt forced . Sure , what results in the film is very entertaining , but it felt like something profound was about to be revealed . The film is a quality product , as you would expect . Billy Bob Thornton is great . He gave two of the best performances of 2001 , the second in Monster's Ball . His character is interesting , but that is one of the major areas that the script pulled back on before it could say enough to make it fascinating . Francis MacDormand is great , but she has far too little screentime . The Brothers obviously wanted to focus on Thornton , but it should have centered less on him than his relationship with his wife . A flashback nearer the end of the film hinted at that depth once again , but it was not pursued . I haven't said too much good about the film , though I've already scored it in my summary . Truth be told , The Man Who Wasn't There is an enormously entertaining and funny film . It contains some of the Coen Brothers ' subtlest humor . It helps to be a classic Hollywood lover , especially of film noirs . The name of the store , for instance , Nirdlinger's , is a reference to Double Indemnity . It's also worth seeing for some excellent black and white cinematography . It's always been obvious that the Brothers have wanted to make a film in B & W , and here it is . It is a glorious achievement in that particular aspect of the art of filmmaking .
384563	391152	334372	8.0	This short can now be found on the new Winstar DVD of Goodbye , Dragon Inn	Perhaps this is best described as a curio . It's an addendum to What Time Is It There ? , Tsai's previous feature . The girl in that film ( Shiang-chyi Chen ) has returned to Taipei from Paris ( with no indication of how long she's been gone or how long she's been back ) , and she is searching for the man who sold her a watch on a skywalk ( Kang-sheng Lee ) . But , as the title states , the skywalk is gone . She never finds Lee , but Tsai eventually turns his focus to him . He lost his job because there is no more skywalk ( though , as I recall , though I haven't seen it in a couple of years , that the suitcase full of watches was stolen by a hooker ) . Now he is reduced to prostituting himself to men ( or starring in porn videos made for gay men ) . The film has little reason to exist , but any Tsai , I think , is worth watching . At 25 minutes , this short contains about five times as much dialogue as Goodbye , Dragon Inn .
385903	391152	67677	8.0	Well worth checking out	Excellent early Fassbinder about two shiftless young men who decide , seemingly on the spur of a moment , that the next big step in their lives will be an extended expedition for treasure in Peru's Rio das Mortes region . One of their fiancées ( Hanna Schygulla , as gorgeous and as great as ever ) finds the notion stupid and wants to put a stop to it . It's a droll comedy and has a ton of great sequences . This is the first film in a Fassbinder bender I'm going on . I'm planning on seeing all of the films of his that have recently been released on DVD . I've been thinking a lot about this particular auteur lately . I don't think that enough time has passed since his untimely death to allow his career to be taken into proper perspective . Fassbinder reminds me a lot of Rohmer , Ozu , Godard and Bresson . He's in his own little world in his films ( a world which changed a lot in the 13 or so years during which he was active ) , and a lot of people are still misunderstanding it as overly theatrical , or stilted , or otherwise . The more films one sees by him , the more one gets adjusted to this universe . I think Rio das Mortes is best appreciated by Fassbinder's fans , and is unlikely to make any new converts ( start with Ali : Fear Eats the Soul , Fox and His Friends , and The Marriage of Maria Braun ) .
385097	391152	228687	8.0	Quite good , but I wish Svankmajer would use more animation	Perhaps Jan Svankmajer is sick of the medium of stop-motion animation which first made him famous . Perhaps he's trying to move into pure filmmaking . And perhaps I shouldn't criticize him for that . He's actually an excellent live-action director as well , which Little Otik ( in Czech " Otesanek , " " Greedy Guts , " the name of an Eastern European fairy tale from which the script is adapted ) demonstrates . But I'm not sure he wants to leave stop-motion animation behind . It seems to me more like he wants to use it more often in the film , but he didn't have the money . If you're interested in Svankmajer's work , start with his short stop-motion films , then move to Alice , his version of Alice in Wonderland , and then move to this film and then Faust . As for the film itself , it's imperfect . Its biggest problem is that it's overlong . There's really not enough meat in it ( well , there's enough meat literally ) . It can move slowly , especially nearer the beginning . Also , the ending is a bit abrupt . Still , there're a lot of great scenes and set pieces . It can also be very funny . It's certainly the most humorous side of Jan Svankmajer that I've seen . .
385241	391152	317648	8.0	Well made adventure yarn	A great action / adventure movie ! I was surprised at just how good it was , as it has received so little attention . Viggo Mortensen of Lord of the Rings plays Frank Hopkins , a real-life cowboy , although probably much fictionalized in this movie . He is a half-breed , part Native American and part white . In the film's prologue , he works for the cavalry and witnesses the massacre of his people at Wounded Knee . The event scars him and he becomes a lush . For some easy money , he and his horse , Hidalgo , enter Buffalo Bill's roadshow . Hidalgo is so famous that a sheik has sent a servant to invite him to participate in a race across the Arabian desert , which he accepts , it being a better alternative to the humiliating performances . It's really a classical adventure movie , with princesses and scimitars and sandstorms and swarms of locusts . Omar Sharif co-stars as the sheik . Its nice to see a movie like this made with care . It never gets stupid , and , while it moves quickly , it isn't too fast , either . The director is Joe Johnston , whom I think is an undervalued filmmaker who specializes in these kinds of enjoyable yarns . His previous films include Jurassic Park 3 , which is my favorite of that series , Jumanji , The Rocketeer , Honey I Shrunk the Kids , as well as episodes of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles , which I loved in my tween years . He also made October Sky , which I haven't seen , but has been recommended . The film also features good performances from Zuleikha Robinson , soon to be a star , I'm sure , Louise Lombard , and Adam Alexi-Malle , one of my favorite character actors ( he was the guy who wrote Chubby Rain in the movie Bowfinger ) . .
385509	391152	89960	9.0	Uncompromising masterpiece from perhaps the cinema's greatest female director	Vagabond begins with the discovery of a woman's corpse in a ditch . She has frozen to death in the night . Police officers lift the lifeless body out of the ditch as if it were a rigid statue . The rest of the film follows the last leg of this woman's life . We drop in on interviews with people who had come into contact with her in the recent past . Sometimes it is a police officer interviewing , sometimes the bits of information are given without solicitation , as an aside to the camera . Agnes Varda's presence is always felt behind the camera . She speaks aloud at the beginning of the film , announcing the subject of the film . Vagabond is a study of this woman , Mona , and also of the different thoughts projected on her by different people . To some , she was a piece of meat , to be screwed . To others , she represented freedom . " I wish I were free like her " we hear from a couple of speakers ( incidentally , not all of the interviewees know that she is dead ; the interview structure is never clearly defined , giving it a ghostly feeling ; oh , and also incidentally , the structure of the film is co-opted from Citizen Kane ; that's not something that most will notice ( the film is too strong on its own to be reduced like that ) , and it's not something that's at all important , but it's kind of a neat fact ) . To others , she represents a lost cause . Yet others feel pity towards her . A college professor whom Mona meets gives her a long lift in her car . Later , when this professor has a near-death experience , she violently regrets that she left her alone on the side of the road . Varda refuses to judge Mona or to idolize her . The film is not very emotionally draining . Neorealism isn't the goal here . If you do want to see a related film more in the melodramatic style of Neorealism ( and there's nothing wrong with that , of course ) , try Erick Zonka's excellent 1997 film The Dreamlife of Angels . But not Vagabond , no . I'm guessing that this film is actually based on a real person . It certainly could be , anyway . Varda's only purpose seems to be the questioning of how this could happen . What kind of person is Mona ? How did she end up where she did ? Bringing back Citizen Kane , Vagabond's point isn't too different from that all-time great masterpiece . As much as you can possibly learn about Charles Foster Kane or Mona , you can never know enough to understand them .
385852	391152	110598	9.0	I loved this movie !	I rented this movie because I loved Toni Collette in The Sixth Sense and expected it to be a pretty good Australian flick , but it was much , much better than I had ever expected . One thing I have to complain about , though , has nothing to do with the actual movie : I have to make a complaint about the box . Miramax made this film look like a goofy Aussie romantic comedy . Every critical comment on the box lauded its humor . I even think they made Collette look skinnier on the cover . These people are utter thugs ! This is a drama with some funny moments . I cried more than I laughed . There are so many beautifully drawn characters here . I never wanted this film to end . And it was wonderfully written . I have only some small complaints about the actual film . This is why I didn't give it a 10 : the annoying friend characters who pretend to like Muriel and Rhonda when it's convenient are used way too often . They should not have been brought back near the end . The third act is also kind of long . There are three separate conflicts that have to be solved , and it just takes a bit too long .
385553	391152	38969	9.0	Think it over before you react	This film will never receive a clean bill of political correctness , but neither will any film made before the 1960s . In fact , Song of the South presents some of the least offensive portraits of African Americans you can find from the time . If you really need to compare , go find any other film starring Hattie McDaniel ? start with Gone With the Wind ? and note how much more dignity she has in the Disney movie . Uncle Remus ( James Baskett , who is utterly , utterly exceptional ) is perhaps the most charming character you'll find . He's much more stereotypical of an elderly man than a black man . A smart man with strong morals and a clever way of delivering them , he seems to see things more clearly than anyone else in the film . No , Uncle Remus is a kind man who loves humanity , and this love is infectious . The movie made me very happy to be alive . A more politically correct version of the film would have him rebelling against white society with violence . It's kind of sad that we can't abide blacks and whites actually getting along , preaching brotherhood . The live action bits are very good ( although I think Bobby Driscoll is a bit weak in the lead ) , but it is the animated pieces ( and the live action / animation sequences ) that make Song of the South great . Br'er Rabbit , Fox , and Bear are wonderful characters , and these three segments represent some of the best animation Disney ever did . The mixed scenes are amazing ( was this the first time it was done ? ) . I especially liked when Uncle Remus went fishing with Br'er Frog . Uncle Remus lights his pipe with an animated flame , and blows an animated smoke ring that turns into a square ( which is , of course , also politically incorrect ) . I suspect that the biggest reason this film stirs so many negative emotions is the black dialect used in the film . I think that bugs people a lot . Really , though , blacks from the rural South have and have had their own accents and ways of speaking just as they have and have had in any other region . While the accents in this film are somewhat fabricated , I'm sure , I think that it would be a far cry to think of them as harmful to anybody . The hurt that people feel over this movie is the real fabrication , induced by PC thugs who seem to want to cause rifts between peoples . I think that a re-release of Song of the South could possibly have a beneficial effect on race relations in the United States , as it does depict dear friendships and respect between the races , something that I think we quite need at the moment .
385899	391152	76240	9.0	See it on the new Criterion disc	Difficult to describe , but amazing as hell . Derek Jarman examines the punk aesthetic , with a framing device that Queen Elizabeth I has asked her court magician to show her England's future . And I doubt she likes what she sees , a post-apocalyptic wasteland . The prophecy follows a group of punks who rebel and murder pretty much randomly . The film's likely to disgust many ; it lives in much the same world as Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange , and , just like that film , we are expected both to revile and have fun with the horrors that are perpetrated on screen . Criticism has been all over on this film , but it's mostly been negative , with a few cultists embracing it . This is the kind of film that I can really love , as I am a kind of pseudo-revolutionary myself . I enjoy observing rebellion in all of its forms , anyway , and I like to think I would like to somehow take part in it . Yes , that could be considered pretentious , but that especially fits in with this film . Jarman was never of like mind with the movement he was depicting , and he himself is emulating what he perceives as punk . And he's partly horrified at what he's observing . I loved watching this movie , in all its simultaneous beauty and ugliness . The documentary included on the Criterion disc , Jubilee : A Time Less Golden , convinced me that the film wasn't only impressive on a primal level . It's one of the best of this kind of documentaries , in that it doesn't at all slavishly tell us how great Jarman or Jubilee is . Instead , it clearly outlines all the contradictions of the artist and the film . Strangely enough , it helps solidify the importance and greatness of the film , while pretty much quashing the many criticisms that have been leveled at it throughout the years . The review of the film at DVD Verdict ( www . dvdverdict . com / reviews / jubilee . shtml ) was also a big help . Jubilee is definitely a must-see , an outrageous and remarkable cinematic experience . .
385869	391152	357413	9.0	Thank God ! A movie that is actually funny !	I was afraid I'd be getting another Dodgeball here , especially when I saw that the completely talentless Vince Vaughn was on the payroll , but nope . This doesn't pull any punches . It's also the movie that Will Ferrell deserves to star in . He's far too funny to make crap like Old School and Elf . This is his movie and he dominates . His talent with words is unmistakable . He plays arrogant anchorman Ron Burgundy , of course . Christina Applegate wants to take his job away from him and become the first anchorwoman in the United States ( the story takes place in the 1970s ) . Applegate doesn't have too much to do here , although some of her insults are classic . She's mostly the straightman here . Most of the laughs after Ferrell come from his news team , made up of Paul Rudd , David Koechner , and Steven Carell . They're all funny , but Carell , as a weatherman with a tiny IQ , gets the most laughs . The movie is successful both when it is playing jokes on Burgundy's arrogance and when it gets entirely surreal . The funniest scene in the film involves a huge rumble between five different news teams . I could hardly breathe during this sequence . And the climactic scene is outrageous ! Anchorman also employs two devices that usually betray a sense of desperation , the celebrity cameo and outtakes during the credits . It might be the only time these cameos ever made me laugh , and the outtakes are really funny mostly because they are made up of alternative improvisations . Except for an outtake from Smoky and the Bandit that hilariously sneaks up . I can't imagine that there'll be a funnier movie this year . In fact , as it is easily the most consistently good movie I've seen in 2004 , it probably qualifies as my favorite film of the year , at least so far . .
385287	391152	45963	9.0	Brush up your Shakespeare . . . ( wow , I bet I'm the tenth person to use that line for a summary ! )	A spectacularly entertaining back-stage musical about a group of actors putting on a musical version of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew . The two leads in the play , Lilli ( Kathryn Grayson ) and Fred ( Howard Keel ) , were formerly married , and have a lot to fight about . But can they keep it out of the show ? Hardly ! We see the first fifteen or so minutes of the actual play ( which is entitled Kiss Me Kate ) with Lilli and Fred following the script to a T . But when Lilli discovers that Fred's boquet , which she had thought was meant for her , was actually meant for the second most important actress ( strangely named Lois Lane , and played exquisitely by Ann Miller ) , she flips out , begins adding lines , and starts smacking Fred around in front of the audience . Fred responds by bending her over his knee and giving her a ripe spanking as the curtain falls on the first act . From there on out , it's warfare , and it's really funny . The funniest bits involve a couple of gangsters , Keenan Wynn and James Whitmore , who are at one point forced to don costumes so that they can keep Lilli from fleeing the stage in the middle of a show . Why they are there is a little too complicated to explain . There's also one very funny moment that is unintentional . Ann Miller sings a song about her three suitors ( one of whom is played by the great Bob Fosse , whose part is so sadly small ; but , man , can he dance ! ) , in which she nicknames them Tom , Dick , and Harry . When the song begins to break down , she starts chanting : " I'll take a Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick . . . " Boy , how words can change . Everything about the picture is fantastic except for the songs . The lyrics are always top notch , but the music is generally not very memorable . Ann Miller's first number , " Too Darn Hot , " is the best , and you've got to love " Brush Up Your Shakespeare , " the only song which the two gangsters participate in . I think it's just amusing to see the two thugs dance around . .
384595	391152	51196	9.0	Hilarious and intelligent	A fantastic satire of the modern world of business . Tony Randall stars as Rockwell Hunter , a writer for television advertisements . He's not really making it at his job , and is about to go under . By a couple of coincidences , he finds out where Hollywood starlette , Rita Marlowe ( Jayne Mansfield ) , is hiding out in New York and thinks he can convince her to endorse a certain kind of lipstick . When Hunter arrives at Marlowe's apartment , she uses him to make her boyfriend , the star of a television Tarzan show , jealous . The boyfriend reveals Marlowe's secret love affair to the tabloids , and , in an instant , Rock has been reborn as " Loverboy " ( no , not the ' 70s rock group ) , and the girls go wild over him . He's famous , and thus begins his meteoric rise to his company's presidency . But the further up he goes , the more he realizes that this was never what he wanted , despite what he once thought . The moral of the story is a bit pedestrian , but it's one that ought to be reinforced at times . It's also delivered in quite an original way . The film is full of the kind of innovations that the undervalued Frank Tashlin was so good at . Particularly memorable is the mid-movie dig at television . Television is a constant target in the film - it was presumably making the lives of many in Hollywood a bit miserable . At the halfway point of Rock Hunter , Tony Randall pops out from behind a curtain to address those in the audience who are more the type to watch television than go to the movies . " I wanted to interrupt the film you are watching so the T . V . people can feel at home . " The acting in the film is universally superb . I would never have imagined that Tony Randall could carry a movie , especially playing an everyman ( I always think of him as a prissy , refined gentleman ) , but he does a great job . I saw Frank Tashlin's The Girl Can't Help It just last week . It also stars Jayne Mansfield , and I thought she was pretty bad . They tried to make her too sweet in that film . Here , she's more wicked , and thus a hundred times sexier . Mansfield is hilarious at times , especially with that little high-pitched squeal she does . It should get old , but it's very cute and always funny . When I was exiting the theater , there were a handful of women trying to duplicate the sound , unsuccessfully . The supporting cast is also wonderful , especially Henry Jones as Hunter's immediate boss . The film does have a couple of problems . The script seems to forget about characters every once in a while . Although she seems important in the beginning , Rock's niece , April , basically drops off for most of the film . Likewise his fiancée ( the one before Rita Marlowe appears , that is ) , Jenny . She comes back near the end , but her role is minimized quite a bit in the middle . Even Mansfield drops out near the end . The subplot which strictly involves her is resolved rather poorly , with a cameo appearance that should have carried more weight and really should have been funnier . All in all , though , Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter ? is a great success . .
385871	391152	289879	9.0	The critics really dropped the ball and turned a cold shoulder on a fine film here	( note : this is a review of the director's cut of the film , which has a completely different ending than the theatrical release ) The Butterfly Effect was either ignored or ridiculed by most major critics . Most minor ones , too . In reality , while it has its flaws , and some rather big ones , too , it is one of the best films to be released so far in 2004 . It is already being rediscovered by audiences , and I think it will find a home amongst the lovers of gimmick films such as Memento and Donnie Darko . I am a fan of all three of these films , and it's not because they're based on clever gimmicks . Plenty of films have clever gimmicks and completely fail . I like these three particular films because they're intelligent and have strong stories that move them beyond their central gimmicks . The Butterfly Effect is about a young man ( Ashton Kutcher ) who experienced severe blackouts during traumatic moments when he was a child . As an adult , he discovers that he can travel back to these forgotten events and change their outcome . Unfortunately , every time he changes things for what should be the better , some individual always gets the shaft . Besides himself , the major players in the story are his mother ( Melora Walters ) , his girlfriend , Kayleigh , her brother , Tommy , and their friend , Lenny . The story is gripping . It's hard not to imagine situations in your own life that you'd want to change , so the appeal is universal . As Kutcher changes time and time again , he starts to lose grip of reality . His desperation grows deeper each time he changes the past . The movie does lose its footing as it nears the finish . One can imagine how hard it must be to end a story like this . It looked as if they were going to go with the ' It's all just a dream ' ending , which really ped me off . Then they cheated their gimmick a little , which , as annoying as that was , it wasn't as annoying as the previous option . Then came kind of an ugly ending which really angered me , and which upsets a lot of what happened in the film in the first place . After a bit of time thinking it over , though , it didn't seem quite as bad as it first did . There are still some major holes this way around , but it made sense thematically . As for the technical feats , The Butterfly Effect is very well done . The writers / directors , Bress and Gruber , may not get everything right , but they have delivered an ambitious and thoughtful film . Better yet , they delivered it right to a multiplex audience who doubtless went in expecting escapism . What they'll get is something ten times more challenging than anything else they'll see this year . The look of it is good , it's well edited , and there's really good use of music and sound . The final question has to be this : so , can Ashton Kutcher deliver a dramatic performance ? The answer is yes , but not an unqualified yes . Truthfully , the protagonist of the story could have been improved . He's more of cypher than anything , and a lot of the emotional value comes from the side characters whose lives he effects . Kutcher isn't asked to do too much . Still , he holds his own in plenty of scenes . He was quite good , for instance , in the sequence where he goes to prison . I wonder if all the pans this film received came because it was a drama starring that goofball from Dude , Where's My Car ? I think , in the long run , if Kutcher wants to become a dramatic actor , he could pull it off . He's a handsome guy with a lot of charm . .
385897	391152	45070	9.0	Great pulp Western by the great Fritz Lang	Rancho Notorious is a gorgeous film , with beautiful Technicolor cinematography . It almost reaches the poetry of a John Ford film , or a great film noir , but falls just a little short . Arthur Kennedy plays Vern , a rancher whose fiancee is brutally raped and murdered . He goes out for revenge , following the clues . He ends up at Rancho Notorious , a hideout for outlaws run by Alder Keane , played wonderfully by Marlene Dietrich in one of her most memorable roles . She's fully in her philosophical mode here , like she was in Touch of Evil a few years later . She's so sad , so beautiful . She also has a great musical number . Mel Ferrer is also quite good as Frenchie Fairmont , a lethal cowboy who loves Alder . There are also a lot of great supporting actors playing colorful villains , especially George Reeves ( T . V . ' s Superman ) . The story is quite great . There are a couple of problems with characterizations , especially Vern . He's mostly great . He's mostly a noir hero , flawed in his own right but always believing that he's on an entirely moral quest . The film goes wrong when he becomes the romantic hero . He's too creepy . Dietrich simply dominates him . Mel Ferrer fairs much better in that way . The climactic sequence also disappoints . The other major flaw is that damn theme song . Rancho Notorious is pulp , it's very over-the-top , but that goofy song would make anybody laugh . Also , the name Chuck-a-Luck inspired a lot of laughs in the audience ( I was lucky enough to see it at a theater ) . Overall , though , Rancho Notorious is a great film , quite haunting in its own right . It's one of Lang's best , by my reckoning , up there with Fury and M . .
385518	391152	27752	9.0	Another enormously touching Ozu film	Incredibly gentle and touching Ozu picture about a single mother who works her butt off to send her only son off to school . Many years later , we follow her journey to visit that son in Tokyo . He hasn't kept in contact very well . His mother doesn't even know about his wife and infant son , nor that he is a grade school teacher , a rather low ( and low-paid ) position . Simply put , he's embarrassed at the little he has accomplished and he thinks his mother will be gravely disappointed that she went to so much trouble to educate him . The whole situation really hit home , and I was deeply moved by it . The film also features incredible cinematography and editing .
385250	391152	51055	9.0	Powerful	Let's get this straight right off the bat : I have read William Faulkner's novel Pylon , and Douglas Sirk's cinematic adaptaion of it , Tarnished Angels , lives in the original's shadow . Pylon , which for some reason is the only Faulkner novel currently out of print , is one of that glorious author's best works . Still , the film is an excellent achievement . The story's power may be a bit lessened , but Sirk's direction as well as the performances of Rock Hudson , Dorothy Malone , Robert Stack , and Jack Carson make up for it . And while the plot suffers from reductions , the dialogue , much of which , I'm pretty sure , was not in the novel , is very good . The best scene in the film is Rock Hudson's drunken and passionate speech in the news room near the end of the film . In the novel , the equivalent of that speech is found in a garbage can . The final image of the novel is of the newspaper editor reading Burke Devlin's impassioned , prosaic description of the final pylon race . It's a perfect ending for a novel , but the screenwriter here was right in putting those words , or at least the idea of those words , back into Devlin's mouth . Tarnished Angels is equal in artistic accomplishment to the other great Sirk film I've seen , Written on the Wind . Both star Rock Hudson , Robert Stack , and Dorothy Malone , but there is a big difference between the two . Written on the Wind is a florid melodrama , the kind that Sirk was famous for . The colors are almost psychedelic , and the level of melodrama makes it feel like the world is about to end . Tarnished Angles is filmed in black and white , and , while it is melodramatic , it never feels like it's going over the edge . Sirk plays it at a level where you can feel the desperation of the characters ( the novel , which isn't as prudish ( the film , of course , was made under the Hayes Code ) , depicts a level of loss and desperation that is simply murder ; the ending of the film , which I wouldn't exactly call happy , is a hundred times less depressing than that of the novel ) . But , unlike in Written on the Wind , it never seems like Sirk is laughing at or making fun of the characters in Tarnished Angels . It seems like he meant this film to be an honest adaptation of a great novel . He succeeded quite well . . PS : The Criterion Company recently released Written on the Wind and All That Heaven Allows on DVD . I beg them to release this one next . The version on VHS is cropped from its widescreen glory , and you can tell . It feels very cluttered and claustrophobic , and often the panning and scanning seem choppy . The opening credits keep the widescreen , and it looks like it might be an even more visually spectacular film than I noticed . I really wish that they wouldn't get my hopes up by holding the original aspect ratio through the opening credits . What I want to see one day is the word " CINEMASCOPE " cropped to " EMASC " at the beginning of a film in a 1 . 33 : 1 aspect ratio .
384892	391152	43081	9.0	A gem	When people ask the question " Why don't they make musicals anymore ? " I find that it is quite easily answered : " Well , the genre was perfected in classical Hollywood . " We can never get to that point again , and can only hope for re-invention , which we kind of got this past year with Moulin Rouge . However , that film cannot compare with the musicals of the 30s and 50s , nor can any other musical ( at least from what I've seen ) of the past 20 years . I had never heard of Two Weeks with Love , and only began to watch it because there was nothing else on when I sat down to eat my lunch . I missed the first 15 minutes or so , but the plot was simple enough to reconstruct : a family goes on vacation in the Catskills around the turn of the Twentieth Century , and the middle of three daughters ( Jane Powell ) , Patty , 17 in age , feels that she is becoming an adult . Her parents treat her like a child , though , and won't allow her to where a corset , the symbol of young womanhood . Another guest in their hotel is Demy , a Cuban gentleman played by none other than Ricardo Montalban ( how old is this guy ? this film was made in 1950 ! ) . He's a bit older than Patty , but she is extraordinarily attracted to him . Her older sister , Valerie , tries to trick her into screwing up when she's in front of him ( she wants him , too ) , and her younger sister , Melba , thinks Patty's a nut . Debbie Reynolds , cute as ever , plays Melba , two years before Singin ' in the Rain . This film has a lot of great musical numbers , but it can go a long time at some points without one . However , it's so entertaining even without the music that I was never impatiently waiting for the next one to occur . The humor is marvelous . The dialogue is very clever , and there are actually a lot of sexual innuendoes . Some of them may not have been meant . For instance , one scene has Patty explaining to Demy how she would cling to him if she fell into a lake . She wraps her arms tightly around this pole that looks far too much like a penis to suggest anything else . I hope someday that I'll be able to see the first 15 minutes that I missed . Perhaps then I'll give it a 10 , but for now I'll give it a .
385423	391152	45009	9.0	An excellent film about rival New York City newspapers in the 1880s	Its main draw is Sam Fuller's direction ? he is , without a doubt , one of the most skillful American directors to have ever lived . You have to see some of the brilliant long takes in Park Row to believe them . The flowing shots make the rather brilliant moves in Alfred Hitchcock's Rope look trite ( which is no dump on Hitch , mind you ; Park Row is just that impressive ) . Unfortunately , Fuller's screenwriting ability is quite a bit below his directorial prowess . You've got to admire any director who was working in Hollywood at the time and was also able to write his own scripts . There is only the smallest handful of writer / directors at the time . But , man , can Sam Fuller be overbearing at times . Fortunately , the sillier pieces of the script , as well as bad bits of dialogue , fuel the madness of it all in Park Row . I found myself utterly entertained by the larger than life situations and the hamfisted attempts at symbolism . I laughed quite hard at a scene where Phineas Mitchell , the film's protagonist , attacks a hired thug from the rival newspaper and pounds him repeatedly against the statue of Ben Franklin . I also loved the overwrought symbolism of the scene where Phineas hangs the final issue of his paper on a hook labeled ' Deaths . ' Or how about the ridiculously over-the-top editorial that Davenport writes near the end ? And you've just got to love the final scene , with the word ' THIRTY ' boldly replacing ' THE END ' . You'll understand what that means if you see the picture . The only piece of the film that should really have been subtracted is the horribly clunky romance ; it seems like an afterthought developed to capture a greater number of female moviegoers and it doesn't work a lick . .
385794	391152	44837	9.0	Chaplin's Best Talkie .	Charlie Chaplin is one of the undisputed masters of the cinema . He was one of the funniest actors of the cinema , and he was also one of the greatest directors . Of course , the films that he is most famous for are his silent comedies , especially The Gold Rush , City Lights , and Modern Times . The latter two were the product of Chaplin's stubborn clinging to the format and conventions of the silent cinema , though everyone else had gone to sound . This stubbornness was certainly sound . His contemporaries such as Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd lost popularity when they moved to sound . Chaplin's last two silent films were popular and made a lot of money . Audiences may have craved sound , but they craved Chaplin , too , and did not disdain his silence . He was one of the silent artists who thought that they were just achieving the peak of their medium when sound came in . He proved himself right , since City Lights ( 1931 ) and Modern Times ( 1936 ) are probably his two best films , and both are two of the best films ever made . Finally , in 1940 , Chaplin directed and starred in his first talkie , The Great Dictator . Three more followed , Monsieur Verdoux , then Limelight , then King of New York , which happens to be the only one of these four I have not seen . The Great Dictator and Monsieur Verdoux were both good films in their own way , but perhaps Chaplin's in depth political commentary in these films detracted from them . The type of comedy that you find in his silent films did not mix well with this social commentary . The simple juxtapositions of the worlds of the poor and the rich in City Lights and Modern Times were far more powerful than what his first two talkies had to offer . Then came Limelight , one of the most bittersweet films ever made . It is not perfect , but it achieves a grand melodramatic beauty that few films have ever even approached . The story is simple : a washed-up , old vaudvillian rescues a young ballet dancer from suicide . He takes care of her until she is healthy again , and even restores her confidence . The story may be simple , but the character dynamics are very complex . As the dancer , Theresa , is recovering , Calvero is not only rebuilding her confidence , but also his own . Theresa , because of his kindness towards her , finally believes she has fallen in love with him , even going so far as proposing marriage to him . Whether she actually loves him or not , and Calvero strongly asserts that she shouldn't and doesn't , these two characters have a constantly evolving relationship that does not end until the credits role . It is utterly fascinating , captivating , and dramatic . There are a couple of problems , and though they're small , they deserve attention . Perhaps the biggest problem is that Claire Bloom is quite guilty of overacting . Her line delivery is bizarre and overdramatic . This isn't a big deal , since you ought to be keenly aware that the film takes place in the world of melodrama , and is thus exaggerated . Another thing that irked me is Buster Keaton's role . It is little more than a cameo . In fact , his character doesn't even have a name in the credits . This is truly disappointing , seeing that he , although Chaplin may have had the most heart , was the all-around funniest silent comedian .
384770	391152	443706	9.0	Great flick . Can't wait for the special edition DVD !	Although I've pretty much despised every film David Fincher has made up to this point , I'd always readily admit that he was a pretty good director . If only he had decent material . Zodiac is a super-detailed account of the Zodiac murders that occurred in California in the late ' 60s through the mid ' 70s , one of the most famous unsolved cases in American history . One would expect , given the director's previous Se7en , that the film would be horrifyingly gory and unrelentingly nasty . The big surprise is that it isn't at all . We do witness several of the murders , but Fincher doesn't attempt to gross the audience out as he did in Se7en . This is all done in a matter-of-fact way , in the manner of a procedural . It's amazing the way that Fincher and screenwriter James Vanderbilt , as well as Robert Graysmith , who wrote a book on the subject and is one of the key participants in the story ( played by Jake Gyllenhaal ) , construct the screenplay . They feed us just tons of details , but it doesn't at all feel like a dull list . The story also skips ahead in time constantly . Every few minutes , there's a new subtitle , telling us that this is " 4 months later " or whatever . It's easy to lose the mood with such a fragmented structure , but Zodiac works perfectly . What's really amazing is how the details build . They're absorbed by the audience . There's so much there that , by the end of the film , everyone looks like they could be the Zodiac . It's a great film , one of the best procedural films ever done , and one of the best , so far , of 2007 . btw , rent , don't buy , the first , bare bones edition of the DVD . The studio was desperate to release it , but Fincher has been working on a director's cut and tons of extras . The better DVD should be along sometime early in 2008 .
385006	391152	49419	9.0	A fine , forgotten film	Cacoyannis , best know for directing the film Zorba the Greek ( aka Alexis Zorbas ) in 1964 , explored some of its themes in this 1956 film , which stars Ellie Lambeti . She plays a young woman who is constantly harassed by the young bachelors who live on the island of Hydra because she refuses to marry any of them . When a worldly Athenian comes by and rents a room in her home , the rumors begin to fly . In The Girl in Black and A Matter of Dignity ( and even Zorba the Greek ) , Cacoyannis demonstrates a perfect and natural ability to explore moral issues within the culture , as well as create believable and moving tragedy . The earlier films came straight from his imagination ( Zorba was adapted from a novel ) , and they are the works of a great screenwriter , one of the best of the era . Cacoyannis ' direction in these two films is also flawless . He did really well in Zorba , too . One wonders why his abilities aren't more highly considered . I would guess it is because these early films are fairly obscure nowadays . I guess he's an artist who deserves to be rediscovered .
385094	391152	100274	9.0	Godard's most beautiful film ; definitely the best of his later work that I've seen	Most people will not like this film . It's difficult to understand what's going on in the narrative . This isn't uncommon in Godard's work , but it's especially true of his later work . I've seen , besides New Wave , First Name : Carmen , Hail Mary , and his segment from the omnibus opera film Aria . That segment is actually one of his best works as well . Sticking with the two other features , they are both interesting and beautiful but very slow films . New Wave seems a lot like them at first , especially in its confusing narrative ( I had to read a synopsis on it to find out exactly what the plot was ) . It shares their beauty , but its even more pronounced . If I were advising someone on this film , I would tell them to disregard the narrative completely . Just watch it for its pictorial beauty . And its sound . Godard's experiments in sound have always been one of the most prominent traits of his cinema . It goes back at least to Une femme est une femme , way back in ' 62 . This film contains the most interesting experiments in sound . The music is absolutely beautiful , and , like many of his other films , it stops abruptly , pops back up when you're not expecting it , and shifts volumes randomly . The sound effects are also quite beautiful . While New Wave was perhaps dull in its narrative ( it's an examination of capitalism and consumerism ) , who cares ? This is film . Film is a visual medium , and this is a visual masterpiece . Remember : RES , NON VERBA ( " things , not words , " an intertitle that appears frequently in the film ) . Oh , and Alain Delon , star of such great films as Rocco and His Brothers , stars . He's still a major stud ! .
384732	391152	29490	9.0	Great	The River is a very wonderful documentary , covering the importance of the Mississippi River to the United States . It's Depression-era propaganda , yes , but it's so beautifully filmed , edited , and written , as well as read . The narration is absolutely poetic . This is a must-see if for all documentary enthusiasts . .
385754	391152	1028528	9.0	The European / DVD cut is just as good as the Grindhouse cut , if not better	I honestly don't get the hate here . Tarantino is a smug bastard , to be sure , but he makes fairly entertaining movies . People complain about the endless dialogue , but I quite enjoy it here . I like the bad , B-movie dialogue of the first half of the film , as well as the more Tarantino-esquire stuff of the second half . They're all interesting characters and fine actresses , and I certainly don't mind listening to them talk . And that last half hour is so much fun that I'd still have a positive view of it , even if I had been bored by most of the rest of it . I had also heard a lot of bad things about this longer cut , but I do not agree with them . I'm not sure I'd say the film gets better ? and definitely I wouldn't say it's a lot better . But I don't think it's worse , that's for sure . This version , after all , does contain the lap dance , which was infamously " missing " from the Grindhouse cut . And it's HOT ( and has a great song playing ) . There's also a stronger connection between the two halves . It still feels like two different films , but it makes more sense now . It's been reported that the conversation scenes are all extended . I don't think they are at all . Certainly not in the second half , the conversation in the restaurant . It's the same as it was in the Grindhouse cut . There are a couple of brief bits in the first half that are extended , but nothing over which to get angry . The second half contains a pretty good sequence where the new chicks are introduced . I don't see anything at all to object to , and I was glued to the screen for the entire film . I had thrown it in thinking I would fall asleep . The adrenaline that was pumping in my system would not allow for that .
385548	391152	48947	9.0	Well deserved Oscar for Ingrid Bergman	Excellent film about a group of Imperial Russian expatriates who try to pass off a nobody as the Grand Duchess Anastasia , who was supposedly executed along with the rest of her family a decade ago . No one knows , not even the woman herself , whether she is or is not Anastasia . Ingrid Bergman plays this woman in her glorious return to Hollywood after several years of exile on account of the affair she had with Italian director Roberto Rossellini . History , or at least some of us film buffs , see her exile as something other than shameful , but you can't really judge Anastasia without seeing it as a homecoming . The story echoes Bergman's life , as I'm sure it was meant to . Can this Anastasia convince those who once knew her that she really is the long lost Grand Duchess ? Can Ingrid Bergman convince the American public that she is worthy to be taken back into their confidence ? To answer the first , you'll have to see the film . The answer to the second question is a definite yes , as the film was quite successful and earned Bergman her second Academy Award , which she much deserved ( her first was for 1944's Gaslight ) . She was not present at the ceremony in 1957 to accept that award , but I'm unsure of whether she was still in exile at that point . The film was made outside of the U . S . After Bergman , there is still a whole lot to love . As for the other actors , Yul Brynner , playing the man who enlists Bergman in his plot to win Anastasia's inheritance , gives a fine performance , easily the best of the three films he made in 1956 , even though he won an Oscar for his ridiculously over-the-top performance in The King and I . Akim Tamiroff , always reliable , gives one of his very best performances as Brynner's assistant . Helen Hayes is great as the dowager empress whose opinion is absolutely necessary to accept Bergman as the real Anastasia , and Martita Hunt gives a delightful comic performance as her attendant ( she was the best thing in the film , in my opinion ) . The musical score , by Alfred Newman , won the only other Oscar nomination for the film , and it is excellent . The dialogue is wonderful . There are only a couple of things I didn't like , and they are relatively minor . Nearer the beginning , for instance , the screenwriter ( or the original playwright ) has a problem keeping the ambiguity of whether Bergman is actually Anastasia or not . The hints the woman gives off are instantly convincing that she is the lost woman . Fortunately , this improves over the course of the film and the ambiguity becomes somewhat more pronounced . I'm not sure whether I liked the ending , either , although it has a great last line ( which I expect was even greater when it was a play ) .
385318	391152	51361	9.0	The earliest Suzuki Seijun film available in Region 1 ; it's newly released on DV	For those who doubt the talent of Suzuki , for those who think that he was just some kind of a nut who really just didn't understand how to make a coherent film , I present to you his seventh film , Underworld Beauty , newly released on DVD by Home Vision Cinema . This is the earliest available Suzuki film , and the earliest I have seen . It is , by Suzuki's standards , very straightforward . The script , which is extremely good ( unlike some of his more famous films , e . g . , Tokyo Drifter ) , could just as easily been produced in America , or even by someone like Melleville in France . The director is already a master of style , and his brilliance is perhaps more recognizable even by those who don't like his later masterpieces . The story is too complicated to get into here . A gang is after some diamonds one of their defecting members swallowed just before he committed suicide . His close friend , Miyamoto , takes it upon himself to protect his younger sister , Akiko , who is now in danger , not only from the yakuza who want the diamonds but also from starting down the path of crime which led to her brother's death . Akiko doesn't even have the diamonds ; she never even knew about them . Instead , her boyfriend , a sculptor and a student of human anatomy , cut open her brother's stomach and took the diamonds for himself . IMDb doesn't have the actors credited to their roles , but the lead actress ( I think her name is Mari Shiraki ) is exceptional . The actor who plays her greedy boyfriend is also very good . My sole complaint about the film is with the lead actor , Michitaro Mizushima , and his character . He's just not that interesting , and the performance is rather dull . Other than that , it's a remarkable crime picture . The black and white cinematography , at which the Japanese were particularly excelling during this point in history , is gorgeous . I can't wait to get to the next two films that Home Vision has released , and I'm desperately hoping they'll release more in the future . You know how you can help ? Buy them now , silly ! ! !
385862	391152	35937	9.0	A brilliant thriller	A brilliant thriller . It's not as beautiful as some of the other Val Lewton movies ( I really think the director must make a difference ) , but the script makes up for any lack in such a quality . Apparently the story was stolen ; a subsequent lawsuit is the reason that this one is so rare . The film concerns a ship's third officer going on his first voyage as an officer . The captain ( Richard Dix ) takes him under his wing and tries to teach him his philosophy about authority . At first , the third officer is receptive , but it soon becomes apparent that Captain Stone believes that he has the power over his sailors ' lives or deaths . To prove this , he purposely leaves a heavy metal hook loose at night . The sailors are forced to risk their lives to tether it down . Later , when one expresses a very formal complaint about the Captain's ignoring procedures , the Captain locks him in the small room where the men are reeling in the anchor's chain . The third reports the Captain's apparent insanity when they get to port , and , to his surprise , the rest of the ship's crew , even those who were his friends , turn against him . Of course , the third is forced to quit to avoid embarrassment . Unfortunately , through an almost hilarious ( although entirely believable ) set of circumstances , he ends up back on the ship . Captain Stone seems a little too eager to have him aboard , and he has to fight for his survival . Richard Dix is just wonderful as the demented Captain Stone . The touch with the mute sailor - who narrates through this really creepy internal voice - is clever . I'm almost shocked at how well that worked ! The final confrontation is exciting , as the Calypso singer Sir Lancelot ( who also appeared in 1943's I Walked with a Zombie , easily my favorite of the five Val Lewton films I've so far seen ) sings a pacific tune . .
385283	391152	65054	10.0	Fosse's first film ( and big bomb ) is remarkable	There's just something about this movie that I love . I had seen bits and pieces of it some half a dozen times in the past couple of years . Tonight I finally sat and watched all of it . In theory it sounds like blasphemy : a musical remake of Fellini's Nights of Cabiria . But somehow first time director Bob Fosse pulls it off , and enormously well . Fosse is daring and innovative in his direction . Not just in the musical numbers , where you would expect it , but in every scene . He plays , and he's obviously having a ball . After the direction , a high percentage of the film's success is due to Shirley MacLaine , who was never better as Charity Hope Valentine . As much as I love and care for Giullieta Masina's Cabiria , I love and care for MacLaine's Charity . She's such an enormously lovable character , and MacLaine is simply brilliant . Her comic timing is impeccable . Sweet Charity also proves an interesting time capsule of late 60s New York City . In the scene cognate to the Picadilly Club in Nights of Cabiria , we visit a trendy night club where the girls where blue feathers as hats . Clips of Cleopatra ( the one with Claudette Colbert ) and an unidentifiable W . C . Fields movie play on a big screen in the background . We visit a religious ceremony for hippies who sing The Rhythm of Life . Sammy Davis Jr . is the priest ! In Cabiria , a parade of young people cheer her at the end of the film . In Sweet Charity , a group of hippies , amongst them a young Bud Cort , hand out flowers in the morning , just saying good morning to everyone they meet . This movie was a huge bomb when first released . Fosse is actually really lucky they gave him another chance at direction , and then he made a film instantly recognizable as a masterpiece , Cabaret . Sweet Charity did not deserve to fail so miserably . Just the fickle fingers of fate , I guess .
385909	391152	15324	10.0	Almost certainly the funniest comedy I've ever seen .	Yes , counting all the comedies I've ever seen , silent or talkie , this is probably the funniest . I was lucky ( boy , was I lucky ! ) to see this in a theater with a live piano player . Ever scene is brimming with comic genius , cinematic inventiveness , and just plain perfection . I laughed almost nonstop from beginning to ending . Jokes that seem liked they lasted 10 minutes were funny for their entirety . After the performance was done , I think the audience clapped for 10 minutes , and they ( the pianist and Buster Keaton ) deserved at least that much , if not an hour more .
385249	391152	32551	10.0	Note Perfect	There's probably nothing new I could say about this film - just the regular and much deserved praise : John Ford's direction is perfect , perhaps only surpassing it in The Searchers , as well as Greg Tolland's cinematography ; the next year , he would photograph Citizen Kane , and his work there is just the slightest hair better than his work here ( which , of course , means that this is one of the most impeccably photographed films ever made ) . And then there's the acting . Henry Fonda was , no doubt , one of the greatest actors of all times , and this might just be his best film ( other great roles of his include The Lady Eve , made the following year , and Hitchcock's underrated The Wrong Man ) . John Carradine has his shining hour here - too often he was cast in B-movies . Even in Stagecoach , his role was kind of , well , cheesy ( I'm not a big fan of that particular Ford film ) . That scene where Tom Joad meets him in the tent is excellent ; Carradine is brilliant ( and so is Greg Tolland ; man , look at the lighting job ! ) . I do , however , wish he had kept his mustache . It's hard to picture him without it ! But even with those two masterful actors , a viewer's attention will always shift to Jane Darwell , who plays the Joad matriarch . She won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar , perhaps the most justly won Oscar in the Academy's history . There is a scene near the beginning of the film in which , as the Joad family is just about to flee their home , Mrs . Joad finds some old earrings . She puts them up to her earlobes and looks in the mirror . How long has it been since she was young or beautiful enough to wear earrings ? The past is past , and it will never come back .
385574	391152	30711	10.0	Among the best animated shorts ever	I love musical animated shorts , so I was pretty much guaranteed to love this one . However , I think the animation of the title character , Sally Swing , who is discovered by Betty Boop when she's looking for someone to lead the swing concert at a college , is superb . I've never seen more fluid dance animation anywhere . Highly recommended ! .
385634	391152	70544	10.0	Beautiful - a masterpiece	Science fiction is the perfect genre for animation . Unfortunately , very few films have taken full advantage of that . Fantastic Planet , though , uses the medium to its fullest extent . It is , without a doubt , one of the most imaginative films ever created . The animation is simple , with few drawings per second , but those drawings are gorgeous . A gigantic , blue alien race has brought members of the human species to their planet . We're the size of insects to them . Some humans , Oms , as they're called , are kept as pets , while others are wild . Terr , the hero of the film , is a tame Om . Eventually he escapes and joins a tribe of wild Oms . The aliens eventually realize that the Oms can be a threat to them , and begin to exterminate them . The film is filled to the brim with remarkable images , bizarre forms of life and odd landscapes , weird customs and events impossible to understand . Most other science fiction films , animated or otherwise , stop so far below Fantastic Planet . Personally , I think it's one of the best films I've ever seen . .
384651	391152	41513	10.0	The best Faulkner movie out there ( of the many that I've seen )	This is easily the best cinematic version of William Faulkner's fiction that I've ever seen , and I've seen several of the most prominent ones . Filmed in Faulkner's hometown of Oxford , Mississippi , it really captures the feeling of Jefferson and Yoknapatawpha County . Intruder in the Dust is not one of Faulkner's best novel , but , even if it is a cliché to say this , it would be the crown jewel in any one else's career . It beats Harper Lee's good but simplistic To Kill a Mockingbird fifty feet into the ground ( I read that one in ninth grade , and that's exactly where it belongs ) . Two of Faulkner's most prominent characters play major parts in the film , Gavin Stevens and Lucas Beauchamp . Stevens is probably the single most common character in all of Faulkner's fiction . He's a lawyer and he works easily as a narrator , because , unlike many of his other characters , Stevens is a man of logic , not emotion ( at least when he's older ) . Lucas Beauchamp may be the most prominent of all of Faulkner's black characters ( he plays a major part in one of Faulkner's out-and-out masterpieces , Go Down , Moses ) ; unlike all of the other black folks in Yoknapatawpha , he refuses to bow down to any white man . He has pride , and many in the white population find that an execrable quality in a black man . One day , Lucas is found standing over a dead white man with a recently-fired pistol in his possession . Most of Jefferson and the surrounding areas don't see the need for a trial , and everyone's pretty sure that Beauchamp will be lynched before the evening's over , or at least the next day , as the murder and arrest occurred on a Sunday . Beauchamp , on the other hand , declares his innocence and tries to get Stevens to help him . Stevens refuses ; the case seems open and shut . But his young nephew , Chick Mallison , because Lucas had helped him in the past , is willing to help him now . As far as I know , no Hollywood film of this period deals with racism as overtly as this one . Hollywood films rarely persecute the black population , but instead prefer to relegate them to servant roles . If you're an African American actor , you might as well give up and accept that role as either the mammy , the maid , the servant , or the porter , because that's the only way you'll work . In Intruder in the Dust , there is to be found one of the most memorable non-porter roles a black actor ever had , Lucas Beauchamp . And Beauchamp , as I described above , is no stereotypical character , and might have been hard for audiences to accept . Even today , black characters are usually simple , magical , and kind . The recent arthouse hit Far from Heaven is a great example of that . Beauchamp is kind of a jerk , and he's very stubborn . Although he's perhaps a little less so here than he is in the novel , he's not any kind of stereotype . He's a complex human being . Juano Hernandez plays Beauchamp extraordinarily well . I haven't seen the film in a while , but he also appears in Robert Aldrich's 1955 film , Kiss Me Deadly , as well as the cinematic adaptation of Faulkner's final novel , The Reivers . All the actors are great in the film . I should also praise quickly Claude Jarman Jr . , who has the great role of Chick Mallison . The novel takes place from his point of view , and he is the conventional hero of the picture . Jarman is quite an actor ; he captures the character ( who also appears elsewhere in Faulkner's fiction , narrating , for example , events that happened a decade or more before he was born in the 1957 novel The Town ) perfectly . He would appear in another great role the next year in the underrated John Ford film Rio Grande . The only other film of Clarence Brown's that I've seen is National Velvet , quite a different picture than Intruder in the Dust . His job here is exceptional ; I really have to credit him with capturing Faulkner perfectly . Other famous Faulkner adaptations are too melodramatic ( The Long Hot Summer , filmed in 1958 , which I really like despite that ) or too cold ( Tomorrow , filmed in 1972 , which I do not like ; that coldness is a complete misunderstanding of Faulkner ) . The only other one that really does well according to its source material is Douglas Sirk's great 1958 filming of Pylon ( really a different sort of Faulkner novel altogether ) , Tarnished Angels . .
384572	391152	32376	10.0	Beautiful , powerful movie	I love classical Hollywood as much as anyone I know , but I am also aware that the films are often mechanical and emotionally distant . Very few reach the level of Dance , Girl , Dance . The plot is great . It is not exactly original , but it seemed that way to me . I was entirely hypnotized . This is due to the direction , characterizations , and acting . This is one of the few Hollywood films of the era directed by a woman , Dorothy Arzner . Generally , you can't tell this fact , except for in the climactic scene of the film , where Maureen O'Hara delivers a powerful feminist speech . The direction is amazing , but it's definitely subtle and sometimes hard to catch . All the characters in this film , especially the lead two , are very well realized . They're people , and we believed them . The acting is the best of all . Lucille Ball may be best known for her television show , but she was a great movie actress , as well . I can't say that I've seen too many of her films , but it would shock me if she was ever better than she is in Dance , Girl , Dance . She is the spark of the film , and Maureen O'Hara is the emotional core . I think that her part represents one of the best female characters to be found in the cinema . O'Hara is simply fabulous as a ballet dancer who has to lower her artistic standards to make a living . And , like I mentioned before , listen for that speech she gives near the end of the film . I hadn't heard of this film before . I had never heard of Dorothy Arzner . I love the feeling that I've made a major cinematic discovery . This is most definitely one of those . .
384998	391152	361127	10.0	One of the best films of 2004	The most underrated film of 2004 is this subtle , powerful and sad little independent starring Kevin Bacon . He plays a man just out of jail after 12 years ; he was there because he molested pre-teen girls . The movie perfectly captures the mind and existence of this man . His life is impossible . He can't look another human being in the eye . Only one person from his life before he was discovered will even talk to him . Everyone he works with is inherently suspicious of him , and , since his record is easily available over the internet , it's only a matter of time before everyone knows . The police are watching him , and a certain officer stops by to check on him ? and harass him ? at regular intervals . And of course , you can't feel too sorry for the guy . What he did was revolting . But the film really lets us know what it feels to be besieged by the past and your own shame . And also by your own desires . The desire for young girls does not leave Bacon . He even finds a woman ( played by Bacon's wife , Kyra Sedgwick ) , damaged in her own way and sorry for him , but it can't rewire his brain . All he can do is fight it , a task that becomes difficult as his life starts to collapse around him . The film's main focus is on Bacon's internal struggle . The painful romantic relationship that the two co-workers develop is exceptionally done . There is also a subplot ? one that many a review has focused in on ? where Bacon notices a man trying to lure a young boy into his car day after day . There's one major misstep , in my estimation , where Bacon describes this man's actions in a sports play-by-play style , and maybe a couple of things I questioned along the way ( Bacon moves in across from a grade school ? there are laws preventing this ) , but the rest nears perfection . Kevin Bacon , always a competent actor , gives a career best , and possibly the year's best performance . Sedgwick is also wonderful , if a tad too pretty to be playing this character . There are some surprising actors in the supporting cast ( if you enjoy Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon ? ) , but they are all excellent . The director , Nicole Kassell , delivers a masterwork in her first outing in feature length cinema .
384772	391152	74360	10.0	Simple , but labyrinthine . Truly fantastic .	A perfect sister film to one of my absolute favorites , Spirit of the Beehive . It also stars Ana Torrent and has similar themes . And I like it probably as much . Torrent , three years older but looking pretty much the same , plays the middle child of three girls . At the beginning of the film , their father has just died . Their mother ( played by Geraldine Chaplin ) died a while back . The film is told through the mind of Ana , who is still mourning her mother , and she often sees her . It can be confusing at the beginning . Chaplin also appears as the adult Ana , who narrates some of her thoughts , or possibly as what Ana believes she will become . This is very ambiguous . The girls ' aunt Paulina is now taking care of them . The duty was kind of forced upon her and , while she's trying her hardest , it's taking its toll . She's stern and not well liked by the girls , especially Ana . There isn't much plot , per se , and what little there is shouldn't be ruined . We often see Ana's imagination and memories come to life . We see her witness fights between her parents . Later on , she reenacts them with her sisters . The film is about what children observe , how they interpret it and how they act on those interpretations . The film also has political ramifications , subtle ones that are pretty difficult to grasp . The title is the beginning of a Spanish proverb that goes : " Raise ravens , and they'll tear out your eyes . " Like Spirit of the Beehive , the film depicts a child experimenting with her own cruelty and violence . Supposedly this is all a criticism of the Fascist government ( Franco had just died by this point , so his regime was just on its way out ) . It's a very dense and fascinating movie . You'd probably still be swimming through its mysteries on a hundredth viewing . If you thought possibly that Ana Torrent was not acting in Spirit of the Beehive , this will set you straight . Her blank , soulful expression is here in full force , of course , but here you see the slightest smile creep across her face , and you can just tell exactly what she's thinking . I'm afraid I've done an awful job reviewing Cría Cuervos . I haven't expressed how touching it is when dealing with Ana's loneliness ( there's a scene where she dreams that her mother pops into her bedroom to tell her a story that's just heartbreaking ) , or how it often straddles dark comedy , like the scenes between Ana and the maid . I think that difficulty in reviewing it shows just how layered and confounding the film is . It shoots right up my favorites list . It's easily the best film I've seen all year . Bravo to Criterion for bringing this one to DVD . Hope they also get to Saura's La Caza sometime in the future .
385426	391152	50915	10.0	Exceptional Western ( SPOILERS )	Perhaps not perfect , but I think Run of the Arrow is one of my favorite Westerns . I like it mainly because of the conflicted feelings of all the characters . I like when characters are unsure of themselves . The film opens on the last day of the Civil War . Rod Steiger plays an Irish immigrant , now a Southern soldier , O'Meara . He's so angry that General Lee has surrendered , he aims his rifle at him as he passes by . Luckily someone convinces him not to pull the trigger , and he eventually wanders back to his home , utterly defeated . Everyone around him has lost their pride , and he can feel his fading fast . So he jumps on his horse , the one he stole from the last Union soldier whom he shot ( but did not kill ) , the last soldier wounded in the war , and heads out West , which , unlike the South , is not part of " America . " O'Meara quickly runs into an old Sioux , Walking Coyote , who was working as a scout for the Union Army and is about to head back to his own tribe . O'Meara doesn't like the fact that he worked for the Union Army , but he can't help it that he's an interesting person . He's interested in the Sioux himself , and wonders if he can join the tribe ( as he knows that the Indians have constant conflicts with the Union ) . I'm skipping over a huge plot point ( whence comes the title ) , but eventually O'Meara is accepted as a member of the Sioux tribe , but he can never quite become one . He gets along fine with the tribe , but they don't look at him in the same way as they do fellow tribesmen . Even his wife ( okay , squaw ) , who once saved his life , can't accept him as one of them , though she loves him very much . Soon the United States Cavalry comes to the tribe , courting them in order to be able to build a fort . They seem peaceful enough , and O'Meara is chosen to scout for them , so that they won't build the fort anywhere where they will scare away bison . O'Meara is not happy to help the Union men , but he is obligated to do so . The captain of the outfit happens to be the man whom he shot at the beginning of the film , but he is completely kind to O'Meara , and also the Sioux , with whom he honestly wants to coexist peacefully . There is some nice dialogue between the two as the captain tries to get O'Meara to see things from other points of view . Unfortunately , a group of rebels from his tribe , assuming that the Cavalry cannot be acting honestly , attack and kill the captain . His second in command is much less forgiving to the Sioux ( and his underlings are easily convinced that the whole tribe is deadly after the assassination that they witnessed ) , and a small war erupts , and neither side really wants to trust O'Meara , who seems to be halfway between the two groups , and certainly not a full member of either . Here comes the climax , and there's no need to go into it in too much depth . The climactic sequence is well written , but , probably due to budget constraints , not well staged . It's okay , but the special effects and stunts aren't top notch ( even when arrows hit men right in their bellies , only the tip goes in ) . There is a nice scene where a squib explodes when a man gets shot in the forehead , shocking to see in a film from 1957 . I didn't think squibs even existed at the time , probably not until The Wild Bunch several years later . The film ends very well . In the dominant mood of the film , it leaves the audience with mixed feelings . Out of the three Fuller films I've seen ( including also Shock Corridor and The Naked Kiss ) , this is the best . Perhaps Shock Corridor is more immediately impressing , but I think Run of the Arrow will stay with me longer . Fuller's script is great , and the film deserves to be compared to any great Western . Even though it's not quite on a John Ford level ( I think both are masterpieces , but Run of the Arrow is a much smaller one ) , it would be good with The Searchers as a double feature . Both are about bitter Civil War veterans from the South out West . Ethan Edwards and O'Meara deal with things in quite the opposite way , of course , which is why they'd be interesting to see on the same bill . Rod Steiger's work should be especially appreciated . It's a difficult role , a difficult job to express the inner conflict of the character . At first look , it might not look like he shows much emotion . However , everything is expressed very subtly . I think Steiger knows exactly what he's doing here . The rest of the actors are first-rate , as well , even though all the Sioux are played by white people . It's obvious , but , oh well , just accept it . It wasn't a universal truth in 1957 , but it was pretty widespread . When there are choice roles , you know that they had to belong to semi-big-name actors . Heck , even the Native American Marlon Brando sent to accept his Godfather Oscar , in protest for the way Hollywood treated the race , was a white woman in disguise ! Charles Bronson plays Blue Buffalo , the Sioux chief . I didn't even recognize him ! .
385126	391152	462322	10.0	Hard to beat for best film of ' 07	It would be hard to defend this nostalgic double-feature film as a masterpiece , but I can , without any guilt , say that it was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had at the theater . It's not just a movie ; it can legitimately be called an experience . Rodriguez's segment , Planet Terror , is probably the more easily enjoyed and more consistently enjoyable of the films . Kind of a rip-off of Romero's Dead series , but that makes perfect sense as it's supposed to be a cheap fright flick . And what easier way to make a cheap fright flick than to rip off a good one ? Planet Terror feels exactly like what it is supposed to be , with its disgusting gore , lame jokes and Godawful acting ( star Freddy Rodriguez , the segment's male lead , excels at this so well it's downright spooky ) . And , what's better , it rarely seems to be winking at the audience when it's doing these things . It's an all-out ball . Tarantino's segment , Death Proof , is a more confounding animal . After Planet Terror , any movie might seem a little slow . But Death Proof really is a slow burn . It starts off with a very 70s-ish feel , with outdated hairstyles and bad acting that feels like it comes from bad movies of that era . But then , about halfway through , it changes tones entirely and becomes a very modern-feeling movie , with mostly pretty good performances . The dialogue throughout is very much in the Tarantino vein , and let us not forget that it was his dialogue that made him famous . The structure of the film kind of seemed nouvelle vague-esquire , and of course Tarantino was a big fan of that movement . When Death Proof gets to its climax , though , it's pure adrenaline rush . The film references ( aloud ) Dirty Marry Crazy Larry , Vanishing Point and Gone in 60 Seconds , and then ends with one of the most entertaining car chases in cinema history . However disjointed Death Proof feels , it's still a damn fun movie . And the two halves of Grindhouse might not comment on each other much ( they do briefly share the same universe , in one weird sequence ) , but the entire thing just rocks . Add to that several fake trailers for other cheesy movies ( my favorite being the first one , Machete , of which a feature length version is supposedly already in production ) , and you've really got yourself some cinematic gold . It'll be a shame when Harvey " Scissorhands " Weinstein cuts it in two in a short while here , because it's all about the entire experience . Right now it's the film to beat for ' 07 .
384626	391152	42786	10.0	Very important and much better than people have ever realized	An intriguing , understated , and remarkable picture . It focuses on a super-typical American family of the 1950s , the Smiths , husband ( James Whitmore ) , wife ( Nancy Davis , later Reagan ) , son ( Gary Gray ) , and expected child . One night , precisely at 8 : 30 , a strange voice on the radio announces that he is God . For the next several nights , he speaks on the radio at the same time . The entire world , except for those behind the Iron Curtain , hears these messages and begins to listen each night , frightened that divine punishment , or perhaps Judgement Day might be near . The Smiths are as afraid as anyone else . They all fear for Mary , the mother , who is nine months pregnant , may die in childbirth . Her mother and her sister both died when giving birth to their second children , and God has just claimed on the radio that he will demonstrate his miraculous powers . That's the big problem , and then Joseph , the husband , has many smaller problems . He's stuck in a dead end job , he hates his boss , a particular motorcycle cop seems to have it in for him , and the starter on his car doesn't work . They're all little things , but together , especially when the voice agitates him further , he's not sure he can make it . There is a lot to love about this movie . Although the Smiths are such a symbolic family in that they represent the ideal American family ( I would like to suggest ignoring the fact that the husband and wife are named Joseph and Mary and that Mary's pregnant , because , as far as I see , not much is done with that particular symbolism ) , they feel so real and individual . They aren't perfect ; they have weaknesses and fights . But they have such a touching family relationship . I love the way Joe strokes his wife's cheek each morning to wake her up . When Joe's car won't work in the morning , little Johnny imitates his exact routine for his mother's amusement at the breakfast table . The greatest power in the universe may be the force that's driving the plot , but this is a movie that realizes that the little moments of life are what count best , and few films have shown a better knowledge of that . As I was watching The Next Voice You Hear , the film it reminded me of most was The Day the Earth Stood Still . The plot is nearly identical , but The Next Voice You Hear is so much more gentle . Klaatu , in Day , threatens to destroy humanity if they don't cooperate . Luckily , God's much more understanding . Of course , those countries of Eastern Europe who are under the thumb of the USSR never hear God's voice , even though communist China doesn't miss out ( or am I wrong about my history ? ) . It was the Cold War that sparked The Day the Earth Stood Still . Besides one solitary comment early in the film , there is no mention of the Soviet Union or communism . Yet it still pervades any possible interpretation of the film . If God wants to deliver a message to the world , one would think that he wouldn't skip over anyone . Even atheists in the US hear it . And one would expect a writer from the United States to want those who were perceived as a threat to hear God's message . This little conundrum is quite maddening , and there's no good solution to it . I would call it a major flaw ( even though , like I said , it takes up merely a second of film ) , but it allows room for interpretation . That is , I'm not disappointed in that fact , only intrigued . The Next Voice You Hear is a profoundly Christian film , and one of the best , I'd say . It's message is overwhelmingly positive , and it's not really that didactic . There are a lot of points to be thought over after the film is done . This would be an ideal film for anyone to show at Sunday School or something like that . It's really one of the most fascinating films I've ever seen . Really , I haven't even broken the surface here , and I didn't discuss any of its artistry ( of which there is a lot ) . See this movie , please . .
385618	391152	60277	10.0	A favorite of mine	It's not especially deep , but it's a dark and disturbing chambara about a merciless samurai , Ryunosuke ( Tatsuya Nakadai ) , who can ? and will , without hesitation ? kill anybody who challenges him with a sword . He sees himself as a force of karmic balance . The film starts off with him disposing of an old man praying for death . The film is based on a newspaper serial that began in the 1910s and continued for several decades . The story never really ended , and , likewise , the film , which only covers certain bits of the novel , has no resolution . This has often bothered people , but I think it works well . Whatever the case , even if the film doesn't satisfy you as a whole , there are a number of outstanding setpieces . Nakadai's being ambushed in the forest near the beginning . The battle in the snow , where Toshiro Mifune dispatches of a dozen or more attackers while Nakadai watches cautiously from the sidelines . And that final sequence is the mother of all rampages , where Nakadai goes apesht in a brothel . Tatsuya Nakadai is really a fantastic actor . I know , his performance here isn't particularly complex , but he is absolutely frightening in his infinite evil . Compare this to his overwhelming humanity in The Human Condition . Okamoto's direction is assured , and Hiroshi Murai provides some of the best black & white photography ever captured . The new Criterion disc is quite good . It is without extras , but the accompanying essay is a big help at putting the film and its source material in context .
384532	391152	58279	10.0	A masterpiece .	Kwaidan is a somewhat difficult work . Its four stories , with the exception of one , are not very involving and they can even become a little boring in their narrative . They are not very frightening , although they all attain a level of creepiness . Except for " Hoichi , the Earless , " one of the most stunning tales I've ever experienced in a film , you can see the ending coming from a long ways away ( the final episode , " In a Cup of Tea , " is a little different , in that it has no ending , per se ; the ending the filmmakers do come up with is a little disappointing ) . The reason that this film is a masterpiece is its masterful composition . I think I have heard that Kobayashi was a painter . Even if I just made that up , it would fit . The colors are godly . Any frame of the film is a masterful painting . If you are interested in composition and cinematography in film , this is the one to see . If you only care about narrative , read books . Don't watch films . But at least see " Hoichi the Earless " for its composition and story . I suggest buying the Criterion released DVD . It is one of the cheaper DVDs of that company . And you don't have to watch the four stories in succession . If you watch them apart , and they could very easily be watched apart , the boredom factor will fade from existence .
385398	391152	36244	10.0	American Masterpiece	More than a decade before Henry Fonda purchased the rights to and produced Twelve Angry Men , he starred in The Ox-Bow Incident , another film about possibly innocent men accused of murder and up for execution . Luckily , the kid from Twelve Angry Men didn't live in the old West , ' cause they didn't have them darn , highfalutin ' courts back then ! News comes to a small town that a rancher has been shot by cattle rustlers . It's frightening , but terribly believable , how quickly a lynch mob forms . A couple of citizens try to calm down the bunch , but are unable to . Fonda is very understated in one of his best roles as a man who clearly objects to the way the mob ( which he is a part of ) acts towards three men they find , but is unsure of what he can do to stop it . He more or less just goes along with it . There isn't a performance in the bunch that isn't masterful . Standouts include Jane Darwell as the only woman in the mob , toting a giant shotgun along ( it's actually quite funny in itself , but still chilling ) and a young Anthony Quinn as one of the men the mob believes did the killing . You can see from the very start where the film's going and what its point is , but the level of acting , direction , and dialogue make it one of the best American films . .
385173	391152	237993	10.0	If they were to release this in the US , it could be a runaway hit	SPOILERSOr , at the very least , it's destined to be a cult favorite . It also could give credit to Icelandic filmmaking . The only Icelandic filmmaker that anyone knows here is Fridrick Thor Fridthrickson ( sp ? ) , although he is not know all that well , either . 101 Reykjavik is a perfect comedy , with great hints of drama all throughout its running time . Basically , it is about the greatest slacker I've ever seen , a 28 year old man who lives in a small apartment with his mother , lives on unemployment and sees no reason to ever do anything about it . I read one critic complain that the film's biggest problem was the complete unlikability of Hlynur , this slacker . I disagree wholeheartedly . He is a jerk , but I have had plenty of doubts about the worthiness of everything I've ever done . A lot of Hlynur's problems ( and the problems of his mother ) stem from the alcoholic patriarch , whom we just get two brief but telling glimpses of during the film . His character is entirely pathetic , in that I felt real sympathy for him . Hlynur has a girlfriend of sorts whom he doesn't really care for in any true way , and he has no problems cheating on her when a friend of his mother's , Lola , a Spanish Flamenco dancer , ends up sleeping with him . And yes , as you probably know , Hlynur immediately finds out that his mother is in love with Lola . And then , after a couple of scenes , he finds out that both his girlfriend and Lola are pregnant with his baby . All of this works like a bitter wake up call to Hlynur . He tries his hardest to resist it all , even attempting suicide ( by AIDS , sleeping with a horribly ugly woman , then , when he realizes that that will take too long ( and is quite unpleasant ) , by exposure to a harsh Icelandic snowstorm ) . Eventually , he realizes that that is not the way to go , and straightens up ( almost to my displeasure ) . Everything in the movie works well . My only complaints are tiny . I would maybe have liked one or two more small flashbacks to the past , when Hlynur's father was still around ( although that may also have made everything too obvious ; I would have to see two different cuts to see whether my idea would work better or worse ) . The only major complaint I have is that I wish the mother had a little bigger part . Truth be told , it is Hlynur's movie , but Lola and the girlfriend have ample screentime , but not the mother . We do end up understanding her character through the flashback , but she could have been thicker . Anyway , it's still an amazing film . I give it a , and demand that it be released in the USA .
385372	391152	51207	10.0	Despite its generic title , this is a great film	In the common way of considering Hitchcock's career , The Wrong Man is a generic and somewhat mediocre Hitchcock film . Not true . This is one of Hitchcock's best , made during the same era as many of his other major masterpieces , Rear Window and Vertigo , for instance . This is completely different than any other of his films , which is probably why it is so underrated . This is the only film that Hitchcock tried to make realistic . It's based on a true story : a man is misidentified as an armed robber . The entire film is about how the police treat him , how his wife becomes neurotic and paranoid , and then his trial . It's all done simply , and there is great suspense built up as well as a lot of pathos for Manny , played by Henry Fonda in one of his best performances . His wife is played by Vera Miles , who is convincing as a woman going insane ( although I'd rate her higher in Psycho ) . The courtroom scenes are very probably the most effective ever filmed - I generally despise that basic scene type . Here , they are very suspenseful . Hitchcock dismissed the film as mediocre . I wish he wouldn't have . His direction is as good here as it was anywhere . .
385850	391152	111873	10.0	The best television series ever on television . Go get your mind warped today !	If I were to make a list of the top ten television shows ever made , I would put Aeon Flux at # 1 . If I were to make a list of the top ten television shows and movies combined , it would end up at # 2 ( if you read my other comments , you'll notice that I often exalt films that I've seen in a similar top ten list format and that I have said that many films are this high on the list , but that was usually right after seeing it without any retrospect ; I have seen every episode of Aeon Flux at least 10 times , so I have the proper retrospect here ) . It only falls behind Stanley Kubrick's 2001 . Like 2001 , Aeon Flux is a mind-bending series that pushed the limits of narrative . As Trevor Goodchild says in the final episode of this series ( so far ; they've said that they might come back ) , " End Sinister " : " A person from a thousand years ago could never comprehend the world today . " Well , Aeon Flux is about 800 years in the future , because one has to see all the episodes several times before they begin to make sense . I like this , because the first few times you can appreciate the art . After you have seen each episode multiple times , you notice how amazingly and originally the narrative is constructed . So don't get angry at the series if you don't understand it initially . Begin with the more conventional ( though that word can hardly describe this television series ) episodes . Rent or buy ( it is certainly good enough to buy without having seen it before ; look at my other comments to see if you agree with my tastes , then go for it if you do ) the red cassette ( which is also on DVD ) , and watch the first two episodes , " Thanatophobia " and " A Last Time for Everything . " Then on the Blue Tape , watch " Reraizure , " the first episode . Next , go to intermediate episodes , " Isthmus Crypticus , " " Ether Drift Theory , " " The Demiurge , " " Utopia or Deuteronopia , " and " End Sinister " ( though you may want to save that for the end ) . Then , for the advanced class , go to the silent episodes on the red and yellow tapes , then see the hardest-to-get episodes " The Purge " and , by far the most mindbending and 2001-like , " Chronophasia . " Personally , I like the simple beauty of " Thanatophobia " and " A Last Time for Everything " best , but " The Purge " and " Chronophasia " will warp your mind for sure . And like I said , don't dismiss them if you don't understand them . Think about each episode as an individual structure and then as a part of the whole . And if you're truly impressed , good luck finding the Aeon Flux book they published , _ The Herodotus File _ . It will help in your understanding if you have the good luck to find it . Also , another miraculously-produced MTV animated series marvel that you might like if you like this is The Maxx . It can usually be found on the shelf with Anime films , but if not , it can be purchased just as Aeon Flux can . It , if I were to list it along with the greatest television series and films , would be # 3 . So please , go get your mind warped today by Aeon Flux and The Maxx !
