385154	391152	116059	1.0	Most appropriate title ever	More thought should have gone into the title for this film . They had to have known it was awful when they were making it . I saw it because I was a fan of Kinnear's from his Talk Soup days . It is absolutely worthless , though , other than one transcendent moment : Rue McClanahan , Blanche from the Golden Girls , is going blind , and her son , Kinnear , makes her feel Coolio's face as a joke . It's not funny . It's just bizarre .
384641	391152	300051	2.0	Terrible !	I've always liked Kevin Smith , if not a lot , but I never imagined he would sink so low . He completely co-opts his talents to make a romantic comedy so sickly sweet that I thought my eyes were going to stick in the back of my head . Ben Affleck gives a performance that should effectively torpedo what's left of his flagging career , and Liv Tyler , while cute as ever , makes you wish that Jennifer Lopez hadn't died in the film's first ten minutes . Smith uses every cheap rom-com convention in the book . He probably thinks he's doing a send-up of the genre , but nothing feels subversive . The little girl , Raquel Castro , is adorable , especially during the climactic music sequence . I don't think I cracked a smile more than once during the movie . The worst I've seen so far in 2004 . .
385520	391152	276033	2.0	Gag !	The reason I always get so ped off at those who demand that all the imdb ratings they give average out to 5 . 5 ( or , if their math skills are poor , 5 ) is because I am rather sure that most people are smart enough to avoid movies like The Country Bears , thus missing the type of movies that would make a Bell Curve remotely possible . The reason my own vote history averages out to a high 7 . 5 is because I can see a preview for a movie like this and say ' I'm never going to see this movie . ' However , once in a while , I just have to bite the bullet and watch an awful movie . As long as it's short , how bad can it hurt ? I usually watch these kinds of movies with my brother , who has a far less refined taste in movies than myself . I'm sure he sat down to watch this particular movie to see just how bad it could be ( he rented it for his two and a half year old ) . And , oh lord , is it terrible . I don't know if I've ever heard lamer jokes delivered with worse timing . Some of the jokes might have even been funny if the actors cared whatsoever , but they really don't . Celebrities pop up in thankless cameos . You'd think Brian Setzer would know better . Christopher Walken tries hard to make something out of his role as the villain , who wants to knock down Country Bear Hall really bad ( his hood ornament is a wrecking ball ) . The script is far too awful to allow him even a decent moment . Alex Rocco , Moe Green from the first Godfather movie , wears his hideous red wig and acts like he wants another bullet in the eyeball . The actual Country Bears wouldn't have been impressive when I was a kid ; they made me long for the live action Ninja Turtles . Haley Joel Osment is lucky he didn't actually have to appear in the movie . My brother and I spent most of the movie fiercely debating whether the man who drove the Country Bear tour bus was played by Ted Nugent . Dammit , I lost the bet . I should have known Mr . Nugent had more integrity than that ( for the record , Queen Latifah , Elton John , Bonnie Raitt , Don Henley , Wyclef Jean , and Willie Nelson do not ) . ( why 2 and not 1 ? Well , I liked a couple of the songs and that Krystal chick is hot ) .
385018	391152	382625	3.0	Critics were right : it stinks , big time !	The critical reaction to this film was just vile , but then a lot of normal people who saw it afterward said , " Nah , it's pretty good . " I'm here to tell you that the initial critical reception was right on the money for this one . It's God-awful . A symbologist and a cryptologist ( two fields of study which probably do exist , I suppose , but sound awfully made-up ) get framed for murder and get caught up in an ages-old clash between factions of the Catholic church . The movie mostly consists of the two scholars ( Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou ) racing from one locale to another solving riddles and puzzles , and just barely escaping the cops and the villains each time . The puzzles are reminiscent of the ones the Riddler produced on the 1960s Batman show : they're completely inane ; no one could ever solve them , certainly not the audience . But somehow the heroes figure it all out in a matter of seconds . It's about as much fun as watching someone do a Sudoku when you don't know the rules . And the characters are as paper-thin as they could possibly be . I had absolutely zero involvement with them or their adventure . Dan Brown's novel is famously terrible , and , while I've often heard cinema improves his painful prose , after watching this film I shiver to think what actually reading him feels like . If the plot weren't enough to convince me , the dialogue is terrible . The actors are all only here for the fat paycheck . Hanks in particular seems completely dissatisfied with the part . Possibly the worst movie of the year .
385750	391152	408839	3.0	Ugly and misogynistic . What happened to the Farrelly Brothers ?	It's way too bad about the Farrelly Brothers . It looked like they were going to be the great comedians of modern cinema after their first three films , Dumb & Dumber , Kingpin and There's Something about Mary , but all of their subsequent films have been disappointments . Me , Myself and Irene , Shallow Hal , Stuck on You and Fever Pitch were all decent movies , but none of them had the cojones of their first three . They seemed to be getting sweeter , which wouldn't be such a bad thing if they didn't also lose their edge . Well , their new film , The Heartbreak Kid , proves that their edge is completely dulled . Where they were able to combine a certain humanity with the gross-out jokes in a film like There's Something about Mary , it now feels like they are just desperately cramming them into The Heartbreak Kid . None of the dirty jokes work . They're all groan-inducing . Nothing seems more out of place than a Tijuana donkey show . The incongruity of it all isn't even what ruins the movie , unfortunately . It's the way they treat women , or at least one woman , Malin Akerman . Man , does this movie come off as misogynistic . I'm guessing that , in the original film , written by Neil Simon , there's more insight into how bad a person the protagonist is ( there played by Charles Grodin , here by the every day more dire Ben Stiller ) . It doesn't feel like there's much insight into Stiller's character , and I think we're actually supposed to like him and root for him to get into a relationship with the " good girl " , here played by Michelle Monaghan . In the end ( and especially in the end , given the final twist of the film ) , I hated the guy . Akerman comes off as nasty , but Stiller's character doesn't even deserve to get peed on by her .
384750	391152	241527	3.0	How to take advantage of your children's naivety for the sake of cold cash . . .	I have , in all my life as a lover of both literature and the cinema , hardly ever come upon a piece of work more unimaginative , more ugly , more uninteresting , more lacking in suspense , more lacking in charm , more greedy , more incoherent . . . Okay , okay . I'll stop with the superlative negatives . Surely there have been worse , and , yes , off the top of my head , I can think of many that are worse . However , for a book that over 125 million people have read , and for a movie that cemented the record for the biggest opening weekend in history , and also for a book that has had not only kids but critics singing its praises , and also for a movie which one particularly fat-headed critic called the Wizard of Oz of its generation , I am more than severely disappointed . I know that , had it not been so overhyped , it would have been just as bad . Now , however , my anger for it is completely hardened and it's going to be a passionate battle for me for years to come . I go into an in depth criticism , but it would be impossible for me to keep to 1000 words . There is hardly a piece of it that I liked . As a film , it was poorly edited , poorly acted ( by most ) , poorly filmed . The only really memorable scene is the troll in the bathroom , although the payoff to it makes no sense whatsoever . The Quidditch game , which has been hyped to all heaven , is completely boring and poorly created . It looks like the FX guys created it with photoshop . When the chess game looked like it was about to be the most exciting sequence in the film , Christopher Columbus , who , I must say , lives up to his reputation completely , begins to edit furiously . I heard afterwards that this was done to avoid a PG-13 . My immediate thought is that the filmmakers didn't trust their young audience to enjoy watching a chess game , no matter how exciting it might have been . I'm still not sure which story to buy . But the person I really want to tear into is J . K . Rowling . What a hack . Never has the word " hack " been more fitting . A former waitress , her idea of imagination is to call things by weird names . Only in the mind of a psychopath ( or idiot ) could the name Draco Malfoy or a Cerberus clone named Fluffy be considered clever . Writing children's literature is not difficult , but this is simply awful . She's clearly ripping off Raoul Dahl like there's no tomorrow , especially in the exposition . The game of Quidditch , which seems to be a drawing point of some sort , is absolutely nonsensical . As a preteen , I invented much more interesting games with much less interesting playing pieces . Quidditch is a game where people score ten points at a time , unless someone catches a special type of ball , which ends the game immediately . So theoretically , the game could end in thirty seconds . And all the other forms of scoring matter not at all . And let's talk about the surprise climax . Really , anyone could have been standing in front of that mirror at the end . It is tremendously unclever . And the penultimate sequence , where the crown is awarded to the best dorm , is anticlimactic and just rude to the children of Slytherin , We only hate one of them , so why should we be happy that the award at first goes to them , and then is cruelly snatched away . And what about Hogwart , anyways ? If you're not supposed to use magic when you're away from Hogwart , why the heck would you want to be a wizard anyways ? Friends , you're well on the path to making your children drooling morons . If they want a great series of books about sorcery and magic creatures , make them read the Chronicles of Narnia by C . S . Lewis . This is the most soulless garbage imaginable . And I thought Shrek had taken that title .
385109	391152	473488	3.0	Just how many times can we sit through this same , tired story ?	Insufferable . Sure , it's autobiographical , but when your autobiography just reiterates the same story that we've seen in the movie theaters seven dozen times since Martin Scorsese made Mean Streets , why bother telling it ? The movie is about a young Italian man growing up in a tough New York neighborhood ( this time in Queens , but just as often in Brooklyn or the Bronx ? they seem pretty interchangeable in these movies ) who hangs out with his stupid but lovable friends and deals with his strict but loving father ( played here by Chazz Palminteri , big surprise ) and secretly wishes to get out of this hellhole . The tiny kernel that propels the story is a rival group of friends , here black , no surprise , that is challenging the Italians ' dominance . Blah blah blah . Christ . We also have part of the story taking place in present time , with a miscast and totally wasted Robert Downey Jr . playing the protagonist and trying to get his sick father , who has renounced his son , to go to the hospital . Blah blah blah . The film is a complete waste of talent and time . One of the worst of ' 06 .
384776	391152	456554	3.0	Can only barely count as a movie	Lame pot-inspired comedy produced by Adam Sandler . The low quality of this flick makes me long for the relatively well made Sandler vehicles of the 1990s . Grandma's Boy just feels like a bunch of potheads gathered together and crapped out half a script that they wrote while giggling through clouds of smoke . Things people find hilarious when high tend to be , if you're lucky , only slightly funny in sobriety . The only element of the movie that's ever even remotely entertaining is the wonderful stand-up comedian Nick Swardson , who was the reason I rented it in the first place . His movie characters are always the same , but he has a great sense of comic timing . In the film , he gets to sleep with Shirley Jones . Poor Shirley Jones . All of her Patridge Family money must be spent , and DVDs of The Music Man must be gathering dust on Best Buy's shelves . The film also co-stars Jonah Hill , who's getting famous right now from his roles in Knocked Up and Superbad , and Doris Roberts , aka Ray Romano's mom on Everybody Loves Raymond . The movie actually stars Allen Covert . All I have to say about him is it must be nice to have rich friends like Adam Sandler .
384587	391152	784972	4.0	Lame	This was kind of a test watch , the first film I watched through Netflix's instant watch option . I didn't expect this film to be that good , and I didn't want to waste a place in my queue for it . My instincts were correct about the film's quality . Bob Odenkirk , one of the funniest men who ever lived , hasn't had great success as a director . This film is unbelievably sloppy in both its script and its editing . I rarely notice editing mistakes , but they're rampant here . Everything would be forgiven , of course , if the film were funny . The Brothers Solomon has its moments , but , in general , it's lame . Will Arnet and Will Forte play too socially stunted brothers who want to have a baby before their coma-afflicted father passes . After failing to land women who would willingly have their children , they find a woman ( Kristen Wiig ) who is willing to do it for money . I can come up with a lot of things wrong with this picture . For example , Will Arnet is too much of an alpha male type to play a hopeless loser . Plus , as that alpha male type , he's better suited to jerk roles . It can be hard , if not impossible , to root for him . And Forte is funny enough on Saturday Night Live , but he never stood out . He comes off as weaker than Arnet , and , even if I'm not laughing at Arnet , he ends up burying Forte . Wiig is usually a pretty funny gal , but she's cast here as the straight man . The only actor who consistently gets laughs is Chi McBride as Wiig's enormous African American boyfriend with a foul mouth . Swears may be cheap laughs , but when watching a comedy with a dearth of laughs , I'll take the cheap ones .
385949	391152	417148	4.0	A disappointment coming after Cellular	I finally got around to seeing this film , which everyone was talking about months before its release , but which everyone avoided like the plague when it actually opened . Really , the title is all you have to know about the movie . Take that , and the fact that it stars Samuel L . Jackson , and you can basically imagine an amusing scenario in your head . Unfortunately , a feature length movie has to last a certain amount of time ( although , I should point out , one doesn't have to last 107 minutes , which is how long this one does ) . The concept grows old pretty quick , especially when the titular villains are created with poor CGI 90 % of the time . Jackson seems pretty lifeless , which is surprising considering how happy he seemed while promoting it . While I can't say I was too shocked this was so poor , I was holding out some hope . David R . Ellis ' previous film , Cellular , was ingenious in how it spun such a fun movie out of such a stupid gimmick . I was hoping he could do the same for Snakes on a Plane .
385421	391152	71230	4.0	Terrible ! Godawful !	One of the least funny comedies that I've ever sighed through and one of the most overrated pieces of crap I can think of . I like a couple of Brooks ' movies . Young Frankenstein I would call his masterpiece , and The Producers is pretty funny . After that , Silent Movie is okay . Spaceballs is good for some cheap laughs . But he can make quite the awful film when he wants to . Remember the Hitchcock parody , High Anxiety ? That sucked big time , but I liked Blazing Saddles even less . I giggled a couple of times , but there was only one big laugh . Most of the funnier jokes were ruined by a 60 seconds long promo I saw on Comedy Central ! Cleavon Little , Gene Wilder , and Slim Pickens try their damndest to make it work , but they have no material to work with whatsoever . Some of the racial comedy might have worked back when Richard Pryor first started his career , but it's all hopelessly dated in 2002 . And is it just me , or do others cringe whenever Madeline Kahn shows up in a Mel Brooks movie ? I guess I laugh at her in Young Frankenstein , but she does little but embarrass the production when she comes on screen . .
385418	391152	268995	5.0	Capra-Corn for the 21st Century	I liked Darabont's first two films , The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile , a lot , though I have problems with each . But I could tell that , if he slipped up , he would make a picture like The Majestic . It's like 1000 megatons of Capra-corn mixed with some half-assed politicizing . The film exists in two realms : at the beginning and end of the film , the main character ( Peter , played by Jim Carrey ) is a Hollywood screenwriter . With only one screenplay under his belt , the House of Un-American Activities calls him in for trial , based on a meeting he attended when he was in college . He didn't even know the Bread Instead of Bullets Club was involved in Communist activities ; he just went there to impress a girl . Angry at his misfortune , Peter goes for a drive and gets in an accident . He loses his memory and ends up in the small town of Laughton , California . This is the second realm of the movie , the small town Americana from Frank Capra's films . Laughton lost a large number of its younger male citizens to WWII , and Peter is mistaken for one of them who was lost in action , Luke . Luke's father ( Martin Landau ) is convinced from the outright that this is his son , and the rest of the town , praying for this kind of miracle , is able to easily convince itself that this amnesiac is their lost hero . The material in this part of the film is actually quite good , and could be the stuff to make a much better film . There's a lot of pathos that exists in the town of Laughton . The film could have been about the pain of loss and the worse pain of denial . The screenwriter and Darabont , though , want little more than to tug at our heart-strings . It tries so hard to be a weepy ( Landau's scenes are pretty awful to watch ) , but it doesn't much succeed . Most of the stuff in Laughton is pretty good , and , like I said , it's good material . The real problem with the film is that the filmmakers are not able to connect those parts to the HUAC stuff . The Americana of Laughton is supposed to convince Peter that what HUAC is doing is wrong and unconstitutional ( he reads aloud the First Amendment when he is called to testify ) . The whole time I was thinking , yeah , hindsight is . This is wishful thinking from the future . None of this works well . Jim Carrey's performance is just bad . He can not do dramatic roles , and he needs to learn this immediately if he wants to stay in the movies . The only performance that's really worth pointing out comes from Bob Balaban as one of the presiding senators in HUAC . He had two great performances last year , here and in Gosford Park . .
385021	391152	62185	5.0	Weak film for everyone involved	Mostly reminiscent of Suddenly Last Summer , which was made eight years earlier . With the loosening of the Hayes Code , Huston is able to imply a lot more than Mankiewicz could , but , just like the earlier film , in the end it feels like little more than a freakshow , with little insight into the situation or characters . I was hugely disappointed in it . I also found it nearly impossible to pay attention to . It moves slowly and is very poorly paced . Except for some of the racier material that wouldn't have flied just a few years earlier , it's really hard to believe that this was made in 1967 . The film-making feels so creaky and old-fashioned compared to other American films released the same year , like Bonnie & Clyde , Cool Hand Luke and In Cold Blood . I'm not overly familiar with John Huston's filmography , but with a film like Moby Dick it felt like he was the director most responsible for modernity in American cinema . I didn't much care for the performances either . Elizabeth Taylor delivered the performance of her life the previous year with Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? , and this feels like a reversion to a more classical , palatable Liz ( palatable in looks and style ; the character is a bitch , but it's nothing new ) . Nice to see that her Martha was just an act , though , which makes that performance even more impressive . I've actually been kind of sick of Brando for several years now . His Actors ' Studio style just gets on my nerves , and those habits are in full force in this film . His constant mumbling is so difficult to understand I had to turn on subtitles . The film's final shot is hilarious , though of course unintentionally . Maybe I'll give this another try down the road , but after one viewing I really didn't care for it .
385226	391152	486551	5.0	Occasionally funny , but often lame	The most recent film from the Broken Lizard comedy troupe , whose other films include the terrible Super Troopers , Club Dread and The Dukes of Hazard ( the third of which I skipped for some strange reason ) . Why do I keep watching their movies if they are so bad ? Good question . Honestly , I think the guys have a lot of charm , and they're pretty funny at times , and I feel that someday they might go on to do something worthwhile . Jay Chandrasekhar , the guy who directs these films and co-writes them , is actually a pretty darn funny actor . I just wish he'd act in someone else's movie for once so he has something funnier to say and do . Beerfest is their best film , which is not saying much . There's a good 20 minutes before there's even a laugh , and there are only a couple of good laughs within the picture . A lot of giggles , though . Not nearly enough to make it worth sitting through , but I've seen worse .
385273	391152	345061	5.0	Muddled sci-fi	I really love sci-fi , probably more than any other genre . I like to see different imaginings of the future of humanity . And I am probably more forgiving to sci-fi than I am elsewhere . Code 46 presents an intriguing vision of the future , one where the different races of humanity have intermingled ( though not necessarily interbred ) throughout the globe , and many common phrases in the English language ( which has apparently dominated all other languages ) have been replaced with Spanish , Madarin , Arabic , and other languages . Unfortunately , this idea is never explored , and it ends up feeling false . That has little or nothing to do with the plot . I guess that there are big ( perhaps enclosed ? ) cities where breeding and genetics are kept under a strict control . Outside of these cities , people live as they always have , but are destitute and want to get in . Tim Robbins plays a man investigating a case of people breaking in from the outside . He meets a woman , Samantha Morton , who is in the inside working to help those on the outside . He is attracted to her , though , and does not turn her in . Instead , he impregnates her , violating Code 46 because they have a common genetic code . None of the premises or themes of the film ever make enough sense . I hated a lot of it , truth be told , but the visuals and music made it more pleasant than it would otherwise have been . I have to say , I especially hate Samantha Morton . In the recent past , I was thinking that she is amongst the best young actresses around . But after In America , and especially while watching this , her pixie-ishness just got on my nerves . I had to look up where she was from , because her accent was bugging me so much . Turns out she's from England , so where's she getting this fake , invented accent from ? I just want to punch her . And God knows what possessed her to reveal her vagina for the whole world to see in this movie . The rest of the film doesn't even merit a PG-13 rating , but then , all of a sudden ? hey , it's Samantha Morton's vagina ! No tits , though . .
385142	391152	298148	5.0	Total crap	Only slightly less bad than the original . The story is a little better , I suppose , and it adds a couple of amusing characters . Antonio Banderas would be the highlight as Puss In Boots , but he doesn't have nearly enough screen time . My favorite character was Jennifer Saunders as the villain , the Fairy Godmother . After that , though , the movie just sucks . How many dated jokes can they fit into one movie ? Let's see , we have the ' Are we there yet ? ' gag , which The Simpsons made old in 1990 . The ripples in liquid , which was done a million times the year after Jurassic Park came out . Is it really still funny 11 years later ? In the first Shrek there were Macarena jokes , long after that song was forgotten . Here , we end with Ricky Martin's ' Livin ' la Vita Loca ' which was old and annoying before the original film even hit the theaters . And then there's a bunch of disgusting fart and snot jokes that even cheaply produced television shows would reject as too tasteless . The abundance of C-grade pop songs makes the film even more dreadful . I mean , what happened to Counting Crows ? Their first two albums were great , and now they're doing one of the cheesiest love songs I've ever heard for this piece of garbage . And , worst of all , the animation is awful ! Characters move around jerkily and there's little or no attention paid to physics . Just take a look at Pixar's The Incredibles to see the difference . Seriously , if Shrek 2 beats out The Incredibles for the Oscar this year , as the original beat out the far superior Monsters Inc . , I will be as sad as I was at the results of the recent presidential election . .
385261	391152	160535	6.0	Sometimes hard to follow	This story involves two girls , Dora and Sunako , who are best friends in Yokohama . They vow never to separate , but along enters a man ( with the Western name Henry ) . Sunako goes for him , but he's a bad guy , a gangster and a philanderer . She eventually catches him with another woman , and does something rash . In her shame , Sunako runs away only to become a geisha . Later she meets up with Dora and Henry again , now married to each other and feeling guilty for what became of Sunako . Japanese Girls at the Harbor is often a very pretty film , but I sometimes found it to be poorly made . The first half is especially confusing with Shimizu's gimmicky editing . And the transition between the big event of the first half and the second half of the film is never quite clear . I had initially thought I was confused because I watched it tired , but I watched most of the first half over again and still found it hard to put together . Plus , whenever characters who aren't one of the main three enter the film , it's always hard to understand who they are . The second half of the film is much stronger than the first , but I would still complain that Henry and Dora are never especially interesting characters . My attention was focused entirely on Sunako , and I found it hard to concentrate when she wasn't around . This is the earliest film in the Eclipse Travels with Hiroshi Shimizu box set ( and the only silent film ) , and I've read at least one review of the set that claims that it's the weakest . Looking at the better aspects of the film , it's clear that Shimizu is a talented director . I'm confident that the other films will be better . I definitely do not recommend starting with this film if you're just renting them . Skip it all together , or at least come back to it later .
384969	391152	182295	6.0	Interesting failure	I applaud Kenneth Branagh for attempting this film . He's going for Shakespeare + Astaire and Rogers . Unfortunately , he doesn't succeed . Therefore , on the other hand , I must castigate Branagh for not planning it all out more carefully . The film has great potential , and is often a lot of fun . But where the tremendous energy goes slack , it simply becomes grating . In fact , it feels like the whole project was tossed together in as short a time as possible . Here are my complaints and suggestions : 1 ) Branagh clearly wanted to make a surreal , visually inventive film , but that inventiveness stops dead in its tracks every time it gets going . He'll be playing with the colors , dressing his characters in beautiful and vibrant shades , but then he won't compose his shots so that the color is at its maximum effectiveness . He just throws everything up on screen . The intent with the sets seems to be to make the film more theatrical . I think this is a mistake , especially when , at first , he was going for the visual inventiveness . Something neat will happen , like , for instance , when the men start floating in the air during " Cheek to Cheek " . I was hoping for a ceiling dance or something , a midair dance , perhaps . Nope . They just float their in the air like Charlie and Grampa Joe , and flailing like a possessed character in the Evil Dead movies . And during the " No Business Like Show Business " scene , the camera is positioned straight above , ready for the Busby Berkeley number . But no . That shot lasts less than a second . 2 ) Which leads me to the second complaint : The editing is far too quick . It's headache-inducing at times . Not that the editing shouldn't be quick . It would work if it were paced a little better . 3 ) Branagh never really utilizes the potential of the older musicals he seems to want to be parodying . He's not bad in segueing into the songs ; I was rather impressed on that account . Sometimes he blends the Shakespeare and the Gershwin , especially in the " They Can't Take That Away From Me , " which may represent Ira Gershwin's best lyrics . But Branagh never does it for any reason other than a gimmick . He sets the story in 1939 Europe , with WWII breaking out across the continent . The Astaire-Rogers team went on hiatus at that point . It would have been so easy to follow the logical loss of innocence of that age . Instead , the musical stuff feels gimmicky and the WWII stuff feels terribly clunky ( especially the climactic montage of the entire war ) . 4 ) What's with Alicia Silverstone ? I almost want to leave her alone , because it's too easy to criticize . To tell you the truth , she's not as bad as I had envisioned , but she's definitely not up to it . I would say as much about Matthew Lillard , too , but his role is so incidental that it's not bothersome . He is actually in the movie all the time , but has little dialogue . Lillard does have one particularly embarrassing scene - although the embarrassment of its creation belongs to Branagh - where he humps his top hat . But , wait , what am I talking about ? This is the guy who cast Keanu Reeves in a Shakespearian movie , not to mention the fact that he was playing Denzel Washington's brother . But I don't want to tear into Branagh . In fact , I was serious when I wrote that I applaud him for attempting Love's Labours Lost . It's worth a look . Few more interesting movies have been made in the past few years , and I can think of no more interesting failure . .
384936	391152	390538	6.0	A man's Valentine to himself	Tarnation is a very personal documentary exploring the director's history and the pain that his mother went through with her various psychological problems . There are two ways to look at this film : either you can see it as a soul-searching document produced by Caouette , or you can see it as an egotistical project taken up to achieve notoriety and project depth . While I think the former view is less cynical , I think I'd lean toward the latter . The film was sold as being about Jonathan and his disturbed mother , but his mother feels almost like an afterthought . The film is almost always , and almost always gloriously so , about Jonathan Caouette . He had a fairly difficult life , it is true . But whenever I personally feel my own life is terrible , I think of a scene from Voltaire's Candide , where each person on a ship is asked to tell their sob story , and each story is more horrific than the last . Yes , Jonathan , it was bad , but others have had much worse , and much more interesting lives . And when you put your face on screen for eighty minutes of the time , use third-person narration to describe the events in your life , and have all of your greatest works of creation on display , it's hard for the audience not to find it egotistical . Still , the film can be affecting , and the editing ( done on a Mac ) shows great skill . The film was an obvious influence on director John Cameron Mitchell's film Shortbus , in which Caouette appeared in a bit part .
385451	391152	981227	6.0	Cute but forgettable	Michael Cera plays Nick , a rock musician who has recently been dumped by his girlfriend ( Alexis Dziena ) . The rest of his band forces him into the arms of a beautiful girl , Norah ( Kat Dennings ) who has showed up to their show . The film takes place over one night in New York City , and we watch the two kids fall for each other while some hip music plays over the soundtrack . The two leads are quite charming . We've seen Cera do this same role before , so Dennings is the real surprise here . She's stunning , and this movie's sure to make her a big star . The casting is quite off in this movie , though . It's the kind of movie where Norah is frequently chastised for being a nerd and ugly and sexually inexperienced , but she never comes off as such . Dziena comes off as far too sexy to have been dating Cera in any life . Jay Baruchel shows up as Norah's on-again-off-again boyfriend , and , if you're familiar with his career anyway , he's way too dorky and likable to be playing any sort of villain . Or even anyone cool . I did like the three gay guys who comprised the rest of Cera's band . Aaron Yoo is quite good . He was also in the underrated film Rocket Science last year .
384841	391152	60860	6.0	You'd have to be interested in the era	Lethargic minimalist film about Louis XIV's rise to power in the mid 17th Century . I suppose if I had a greater interest in the time period or historical characters , I wouldn't have been bored . Case in point , several months ago I saw another of Rossellini's biopics from the same period , Socrates ( 1970 ) , and , as I am a classics scholar , I liked it very much . I know a lot about Socrates , but almost nothing about Louis XIV . Both are similar in style ( although Louis has much less dialogue ) . I guess Rossellini's point was to subtract the usual pomp and circumstance that surrounds the European royalty of this historical period , depicting everything in a very realistic light . I think I can make at least two legitimate criticisms against this film : 1 ) I think it takes too long with the first act , the Cardinal's death . It takes more than a half an hour of a 100 minute film ( actually , the Hen's Tooth video falls about 9 minutes short of that mark ) . We learn nothing much about what is actually going on during this half hour . 2 ) Jean-Marie Patte , who plays Louis XIV , seemed particularly passionless to me . I did like some parts , or at least I found them interesting . At one point , Louis designs his now-famous costume . He tells his subordinates that all nobles will be dressed in exactly the same way . In the following scene , they are . I also liked the meal scene , where we , as well as everyone else in his court , watch as patiently as possible as Louis eats course after course . The nobles in the court feign interest . What weird customs we humans have developed . I wouldn't suggest The Rise of Louis XIV unless you are interested in the period , or are a huge fan of Rossellini . .
385014	391152	55256	6.0	Loud , obnoxious and jingoistic - certainly not among Wilder's best works	Made in West Berlin while the Berlin Wall was being erected and dealing with the Cold War while it was escalating dramatically , there is no shortage of historical interest in this Billy Wilder comedy . However , as much as I don't want to be put into the position of defending the U . S . S . R . , One , Two , Three comes off as painfully jingoistic and the same kind of propaganda that it itself is deriding . It's also guilty of being wildly obnoxious and loud in its comedy , which is , at best , hit or miss . James Cagney plays Coca-Cola's man in West Berlin , on the brink of getting the drink behind the Iron Curtain , for which he expects to get a promotion . His boss scoffs at the idea of commies drinking America's favorite beverage . A different possibility for promotion arrives when Cagney welcomes the boss's 17 year-old daughter ( Pamela Tiffin ) to stay with him and his family . If he does a good job , keeps her away from trouble , he could get out of Germany , whose population reminds him of the war with their boot clicking and militaristic habits ( played as a joke , of course ! ) . Unfortunately , Tiffin is kind of a tramp , and immediately sneaks through the Brandenburg Gate and marries a communist ( Horst Buchholtz ) . Cagney is at his worst here . His character is a mean , petty , unlikeable jerk who yells and throws around his superiority to everyone else constantly . But as annoying as he is , he's nothing compared to Buchholtz , who spouts communist mantras and anti-American slogans at the top of his lungs every time his lips part . Yes , yes , Billy , we get it ! He's indoctrinated ! Now , please , hand me the aspirin ! Add to those two the horribly lame wisecracks of Cagney's wife ( Arlene Francis ) , and we have a triumvirate of the unfunny . The movie does have its pluses , of course . I thought Tiffin was hilarious ( she's not offended at the " Yankee Go Home " balloons because where she comes from , Atlanta , everyone hates Yankees ! ) , and I also liked the hot young secretary ( Lisolette Pulver ) with whom Cagney is having an affair ( after the unsubtle sex of The Apartment , it's no longer believable that Cagney's not sleeping with this woman ) . I also liked the three Russian boobs with whom Cagney is negotiating . Perhaps the best scene in the movie is the one where Cagney tries to sell them Pulver by having her dance on a table in front of them .
384935	391152	418279	6.0	Entertaining enough most of the way through , but certainly not great	Okay , I'm pretty much of the generation to which this film is aimed . I was a kid when this show was on the air . I wasn't a huge fan myself , though . I was more of a He-Man kind of guy . I only barely remember watching Transformers . My parents were unwilling to buy me the toys because they were too expensive and they broke easily during their transformations . I really wasn't at all interested in seeing this movie , except maybe on video to see how bad it was . But I'd heard a lot of good word-of-mouth reports and my friends wanted to see it , so I caved in . A one word review : Meh . A little more : it ain't terrible , certainly a lot better than I expected . The film sustains itself with a beleaguered and just plain weird sense of humor that , if not hilarious , is undeniably amusing . In general , there's just too much going on . There are like fifteen different plot threads . The story isn't too hard to follow and mostly makes sense , but a lot of it could be cut out ( for instance , the second most important piece of female eye candy , Rachael Taylor , and her hacker buddy played by Anthony Anderson ) . The action is quite fun most of the time , but the giant final battle has so much going on that it gets more than a little difficult to follow . I might have actually given the movie a passing grade if not for the quick and unsatisfying final battle between Optimus Prime and Megatron . Transformers is pretty close to being worthwhile , but in the end it's too big , exhausting and disappointing to really recommend .
385739	391152	120201	6.0	Half a movie	The first time I saw this movie , I walked in on a bunch of friends watching it in a small dorm room . I was bored , so I sat and watched it . I asked somebody how much I had missed , and I was told not much . The first image I saw was a gung ho soldier running towards a giant insect screaming at the top of his lungs , only to be picked up and ripped in half . All right ! ! ! And the violence only got more grizzly and horrific and , thus , comic . The dismemberments ! The decapitations ! Disembowlings ! Brain eating ! Rule ! After an hour and a few minutes , the movie was over , and I had a buzz . It was the kind of fun movie even a seasoned film lover can enjoy . About a month later , I went home and my brother had rented the movie . I told him that I had really liked it , so we sat down and watched it . After all , I had missed a bit of it . Or so I thought . The movie is about two hours long , and it is split right in the center . The second hour is what I saw : the ultra-violent bug warfare . I had missed the first half : the military training . Ugh ! ! ! Sitting through the first half of that movie soured me entirely over the film's entirety . They spend an hour training to fight against human beings , then they spend the second hour not using any of that training . The first half has some sporadic violence and nudity , but it is not worth it ( well , one thing I can ; t argue with is that this is the movie that ( for almost everyone ) introduced Denise Richard's chest to the world ) . Overall , I can only give the movie a . That's how bad the first half is . I would have given it a 9 if it were only an hour long . I recommend watching only the second half of the movie .
385121	391152	58379	6.0	Godzilla stumbles around drunkenly , gets the crap beat out of him by a giant moth , then gets even more crap beat out of him by its larvae	I'm not a huge fan of kaiju movies , but I do enjoy them to a certain extent . This one has some fun stuff . I love that Godzilla just gets his butt handed to him throughout the whole movie . He destroys stuff , but almost by accident . He crushes a giant building at one point , but only because he steps on the edge of a ledge and trips into it . His reaction to Mothra is priceless , something like : " AH ! Help ! Giant bug ! Ah ! " flailing around senselessly . As with pretty much all the Godzilla movies , the human element is dull and idiotic . Yuriko Hoshi , playing a photographer , is a cutie , though . I swear , people who think Ishiro Honda is a competent director don't really watch these films .
385979	391152	50792	6.0	Noble effort , but dull film	An attempt to film a Greek tragedy as the Greeks would have seen it , or at least somewhat so . It's intentions are noble , but it doesn't really have any ideas of its own . This is one dull film . The monotonous chanting might have worked for the ancient Athenians , but it cancels out the greatness of the play for modern viewers . Watching this version , Sophocles ' play feels entirely irrelevant to us today . Even though I'm a classics scholar , I've always disliked adaptations of the tragedies ? I feel that we could never really capture what they meant to their original audience , simply because we are so vastly different from them . Fortunately , on a very rare occasion , someone gets it right . Skip this and see Pasolini's 1967 version of the same play . On a side note , William Shatner , in his second feature film performance , plays one of the chorus members . You can't see him , however , on account of his mask .
385101	391152	990404	6.0	Bahrani doesn't impress me much	I remember finding Ramin Bahrani's first film , Man Push Cart , a fairly good debut , but one that lacked any real depth . He hasn't grown much in his sophomore feature , Chop Shop . It also focuses on the urban immigrant poor . The main characters of this film are homeless Hispanic orphans , Ale and his teen sister Izzy . Ale is employed at a junkyard , and he gets his sister a job with his boss's wife . The two plan to save their money to buy a food delivery truck , on which Ale has been told he can get a good deal . The film has one conflict that gives it a little energy , when Ale learns that his sister is working nights as a prostitute . It's at its strongest when it's concentrating on Ale's anger and confusion . He begins to act out by committing crimes , which get progressively more serious . The film doesn't have a lot going on , but with this plot point giving the film a mild psychological complexity , it's a decent watch . Unfortunately , the film craps out at the end with a lame , forced plot twist that so ridiculously echoes the one at the end of Man Push Cart that Bahrani should be embarrassed to have went with it . And that final shot is pseudo-poetic trash . Well , it impresses Roger Ebert , anyway .
385195	391152	81353	6.0	Below average Altman , but still interesting	This film , generally considered one of Altman's greatest follies , is not all that bad . Unfortunately , it's not all that good , either . The director , along with his production team have created a unique and amazing world in Sweethaven , populated by bizarre and amusing live-action cartoon characters . It's an awesome film just to look at . Unfortunately , the script is very weak . I wonder if Altman insisted upon his regular method of film-making , in coming up with a lot of it on the spot , having his actors create the scenes . It feels like there was at least some level of improvisation , and it doesn't work because these characters are all two-dimensional cartoons . Neither Altman nor the actors are ever able to convince that these people are real , even in their fantasy world . When asked to improvise , I imagine the actors had a hard time imagining what their characters ' motivations were , as there's not much psychology in your average Popeye cartoon . A lot of the characters ' interactions consist of moaning , shouting and jumping up and down angrily and it gets annoying . The film might also have worked better if the music were better . Harry Nilsson's songs are almost all poor , except for the two performed by Shelley Duvall , perhaps only because Duvall's Olive Oyl voice sounds so good in song ( remember how brilliantly P . T . Anderson used the song " He Needs Me " in Punch-Drunk Love a few years ago ) . The movie must work in some capacity , though : I absolutely adored it when I was a kid , and watched it numerous times on television . This isn't the disaster it's often touted as , but it's definitely one of Altman's failures .
385358	391152	291350	6.0	Interesting concept , but I don't think it worked	Great concept , so-so execution . An interviewer and his cameraman sit down to interview a long-retired actress who's been shunning other reporters for years . The interviewer brings her a gift , a key that she lost long , long ago . It opens up her memories of a man whom she helped in her youth , in the era before WWII , and we see those memories entangled in her film career . These melded flashbacks are a beautiful idea . Unfortunately , for some reason the interviewer and his cameraman come along for the trip , filming the events inside the actress ' head , and eventually even participating in them . This conceit never works , and in fact the film pretty much fails just because of it . It doesn't at all help that both of these characters are constantly used for unnecessary comic relief ( especially the cameraman , whose reaction shots I'm guessing Satoshi Kon found hysterical , as they're in there so frequently ) . If Kon had left these two characters out of the fantasy , the film might have been great . Even so , it still would have been far away from a masterpiece . The central story of the girl looking for her lost love through her memory is great , but I didn't feel like I knew her well enough to care either way .
385566	391152	69393	6.0	Not good . Duvall is especially bad .	Based on a William Faulkner story to be found in the collection Knight's Gambit , possibly his best work written after WWII , Tomorrow is the story of a dull Southern man who falls in love with a pregnant woman whose husband has run away and then raises the child . The script , written by Horton Foote ( who won an Oscar for his screenplay for To Kill a Mockingbird ) is decent , but it straightens out Faulkner's labyrinthine plot ( told only in about 14 pages ) in such a way that it erases a lot of the emotional complexity . It's so straightforward that it becomes sort of dull after a while . The framing story seems like it is retained in the film because it wouldn't make much sense without it , but it isn't retained very well at all . The film also does not have much of a Faulknerian mood , either . Faulkner's world is a sad place , but it's not cold . The sparse black and white photography in the film is wrong for the mood . It seems very inspired by Carl Th . Dreyer - I'm almost positive of it . Several shots especially reminded me of Day of Wrath and Ordet . However , it all may have worked if not for the performances . Usually when you hear of Tomorrow , you hear how amazing Robert Duvall is in the lead . But for my money , this is easily his worst performance . One of them , anyhow . He displays his emotions well enough through his movements and facial expressions , but , for some unknown reason , he comes up with this way of speaking that is simply grating . It's cartoonish . And you've heard this voice if you've ever seen Billy Bob Thornton's 1996 film Sling Blade - Thornton stole the voice straight from Duvall . It was kind of annoying in Sling Blade , but at least that character was mentally handicapped . Duvall's isn't , but you might think he is . It's an execrable performance . It's also a very stage-bound performance ( the adaptation is tertiary , and was a play before it was a film ) . Olga Bellin , who plays the pregnant woman , is not nearly as bad , but her performance also seems false . She talks endlessly ( the character never really appears in the short story ) , and is very annoying with her affected accent . In fact , even counting the supporting players , I've never seen a film with such affected performances as Tomorrow . The only natural performance in the film is from the young boy , Johnny Mask . Tomorrow is worth a look , especially for Faulkner aficionados , but it is a failure . .
384900	391152	39090	7.0	Not among Kurosawa's better films , but certainly interesting	An interesting film in Kurosawa's canon : it deals explicitly with the WWII era and , alone amongst the man's films , has a woman as the protagonist ( played by Ozu's favorite star , Setsuko Hara ) . Hara plays Yukie , the daughter of a college professor who is fired after expressing leftist ideas . This plot catalyst is based on real events , which happened in Kyoto in 1933 , but the film is entirely fictional . Yukie is caught in the middle of the affection of two of her father's students , Noge and Itokawa , who both follow her father's ideals and both protest on behalf of academic freedom . The film spans from 1933 to immediately after the war , in 1945 . We follow Hara's hardships as she moves to Tokyo and later on to the country , where she must toil in the rice paddies to make a living . It may be blasphemy , but I'm not the biggest Setsuko Hara fan . In Ozu's movies , I sometimes find her smug and annoying . This is especially true for her most famous performance , in Tokyo Story . She's one of the big reasons I couldn't warm to that film . I think she challenges herself more here than she does in her Ozu roles . Sure , it's a more showy performance , but what Hara shows is the skill to depict transformation . At the beginning , she's kind of a brat , and we see her become a full-fledged woman . Unfortunately , the film itself is not great . Probably for political reasons ( United States censors were keeping an eye on the movie industry , of course ) , but also because Kurosawa might not have wanted to drag an already war-bedraggled audience through more mud than he had to , the film is often historically vague . There's some talk of Japan's actions in China , but nothing explicit talked about . Yukie notably leaves Tokyo shortly before America bombed it to oblivion , killing over 50 , 000 civilians in their campaign . She might be suffering in those rice paddies , but honestly she survived the war fairly easily . Kurosawa doesn't handle the whole love triangle thing very well , or maybe it's all just a little trite and boring . Both Noge and Itokawa are rather bland characters . If not for the particularly strong final third , where Hara becomes a peasant farmer , I would probably have called it the director's weakest . But Kurosawa really does shine in that part of the film ( as does Hara ) . The melodramatic montages of toil and suffering seem much more up his alley than the earlier scenes .
384649	391152	41841	7.0		Good but mostly cliché WWII film about the storming of Iwo Jima . The soldier characters are rather forgettable , and the whole film frankly looks bad after seeing Wellman's superb Battleground , made the same year . When you see Battleground , it gives you a feel of how horrible it would be to have been in combat . Iwo Jima is much lamer . It's the kind of movie where , when someone gets shot , they stand straight up , hold their stomach , say ' UGH ! ' and then fall backwards . One wonders why Iwo Jima is the better remembered of the two films . If it weren't for the fine acting of John Wayne , the film would probably be completely mediocre . Yet even Wayne had a better performance in 1949 , one of his best , doubtless his best up until that time , in Ford's She Wore a Yellow Ribbon . It boggles the mind that the Academy would nominate Wayne for Best Actor for Iwo Jima instead of Yellow Ribbon , but I guess Westerns were already passé .
385082	391152	63149	7.0	Don't give up	Looking at the number of imdb voters for both the I Am Curious films , it seems that few who watch the first end up watching the second ( there are 194 votes for Yellow , and 46 for Blue ) . That's not surprising . Four hours of near-randomness is surely a bit difficult to sit through . And the four hours provide limited rewards . Yet , as one of the few who actually did finish both films , I hardly feel unrewarded . In fact , I think , having seen it all , the sum is greater than the parts . Sjöman does present a kaleidoscope of emotion and thoughts , all very fragmentary , of course , but the fragments are currently drifting around in my mind . I Am Curious might not be a ton of fun to sit through , but I think the films will be a part of me for longer than I might have originally guessed . As a closing note , I must say that the films ' lead actress , Lena Nyman , gives an extraordinary performance , which is another aspect that isn't very obvious if you've just seen Yellow . She runs the entire gamut of emotion . As an actress who is certainly being horribly objectified by her director , she ends up coming out on top of it . If there's one thing I'll take out of the films , it's the sight of her dark , sad , curious gaze . She went on to better things , for example , Ingmar Bergman's Autumn Sonata . Bergman surely realized her talent . I don't remember much in that film besides the two lead performances , who , even if there were a thousand other talented performers in it , would have drawn every ounce of attention towards themselves . I'll have to check it out a second time some day to find Nyman . .
385890	391152	270957	7.0	Worth a watch	Fuckland is an interesting film . I personally love the Dogma movement . I wish it had lasted longer . It seems to have already died . Many critics tried their damndest to shut it down . I don't know why . It's the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the French New Wave . Besides Fuckland , I've seen the first three in the series , Festen , Idioterne , and Mifune . They were all great , Festen being a masterpiece , in my opinion . Fuckland isn't up to those others . I was just fascinated with the filmmaking . It's played as if it were a real documentary , with a real person who was so obsessed with his camera that he refused to put it down . At a few points in the film , it becomes clear that it is a work of complete fiction , but that illusion was protracted for an amazing amount of time . I wish that the filmmakers would have come up with something a bit more interesting to put onscreen . It is basically about this guy , Fabian , who is an Argentinian visiting the Faulkland Islands . Argentinians were only in the last couple of months allowed onto the islands , and Fabian plans to impregnate the women with Argentinian children . He sets his eyes on one , and most of the movie is spent on her seduction . The two actors are very natural . Camilla Heany only kind of hints that she is an actress . Fabian Stratas seems completely real . The politics of the film are somewhat confusing to me , since I have only an inkling of the situation surrounding the island and its recent history . I was 3 , I think , when the Faulklands were invaded . The final bit of the film doesn't work at all . I don't get what the filmmakers were going for there . Still , Fuckland is an interesting Dogma experiment . It does break some Dogma rules , though , notably the no extra-diagetic music rule . There is a lot of that . .
385480	391152	26174	7.0	Nice ; maybe a bit overrated	A fun swashbuckler starring Errol Flynn . It's not especially great , but Flynn himself elevates it to a level far beyond what it would have been without him . Really , he's in full form here . The only other Flynn vehicle that I've seen is The Adventures of Robin Hood , which is a far better film . Still , I think Flynn is even better here . He's got such verve and personality . It's certainly not hard to see why he was such a monumental success with the opposite sex ! As for the rest of the cast , I liked Ross Alexander as Blood's somewhat homoerotic friend , Jeremy Pitt , and Basil Rathbone has a nice small role as a partner and rival pirate . I really disliked Olivia de Havilland , however , whom I have liked elsewhere . I didn't even recognize her in Captain Blood ; her character was too dull to deserve any attention . The dialogue is quite good , but the plot and structure of the screenplay are poor . I actually liked the first half , in which Blood has to fight for his freedom from the cruel slavery forced upon him by King James , better than the swashbuckling second half . I found myself yawning a bit at the sword fight and the sea battle finale . Still , it's a film worth watching . .
384785	391152	41944	7.0	Betty Garrett and a few choice numbers make this a decent musical	Not one of the great musicals of the classic era , to be sure , but a fairly enjoyable one . The plot is nothing special , with Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra as ball players both smitten by their new owner , Esther Williams . Another woman , Betty Garrett , shows up about midway through the picture so each of our stars can have a girl . Much like in On the Town , a film made later the same year with Sinatra and Kelly , Garrett steals the show . If she had shown up a tad earlier , it might have been an even better movie . Besides Garrett , what makes the film worth watching are the musical numbers . Not all of them are memorable , but a few are , notably " It's Fate " as sung by Garrett . " Strictly USA " and " O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg " are also very good .
385112	391152	420609	7.0	Good , even if it pales in comparison to Capote ; it wouldn't have been popular even if Capote never had existed	This film had the unfortunate luck to open only slightly after a film about the exact same subject appeared and won a bunch of awards , but , honestly , it would have been overlooked in any case . It's notable for some of the acting , and mostly because actor Toby Jones is a dead ringer for Truman Capote , but it doesn't dig deep into the complexity of the situation or the characters . McGrath also makes a myriad of bad choices throughout . The interviews with people who knew Capote , first and foremost , feel very pedestrian . It allows McGrath to tell us everything we need to know , instead of showing us . It ends up feeling like we've just heard the story , instead of being able to experience it . It's also a little too jokey in its manner . I especially hated the jaunty musical score that played over every " Truman has fun in New York Society " scene , even up until the end . The film also speculates that Capote did have sex with murderer Perry Smith , which is very unlikely and unhelpful to the story . I also think , though most of the cast is quite good , Daniel Craig is miscast . I suppose it's a prejudice that can't be helped after seeing him in Casino Royale , but he doesn't work as Perry Smith the way Robert Blake or Clifton Collins Jr . did . Craig just comes off as too powerful . He's not very good at suggesting Smith's vulnerability . He's always the scary version of Perry . I don't think there's a single scene between Smith and Capote where Smith doesn't freak out at him . Especially embarrassing and cheesy : that song that Perry sings played over his execution . McGrath should be smacked for that ! The 2005 film Capote really looks good compared to this ( it was my favorite of last year's Best Picture nominees ) .
384623	391152	65391	7.0	For fans only	Not one of Fassbinder's best , but certainly worth a look for those interested in the man's work . In mood and style , it's reminiscent of Godard's Alphaville , and my reactions to both films are similar : I am intrigued , but a bit bored . And I don't think either succeed in the end . The American Soldier concerns a haughty German-American soldier , fresh from Vietnam , who struts around killing people for reasons which are kept mostly obscure ( he's some kind of gangster or hitman ) . The police are after him , though the police seem just as wicked . I didn't care much about what was going on ? no compelling reason was ever given for me to care . However , many elements of the film impressed me . Fassbinder's idiosyncratic sense of pace and mood pervades . The performances are pretty good . Fassbinder himself appears in a small role and , as usual , he delivers a remarkable performance . He has to be the best actor / director of all time . Peer Raben never seems to write a lot of music for Fassbinder's films . Instead , he just writes one theme that is used several times throughout the given picture . They are always exceptional , and his theme ( and also theme song , which is the same tune with lyrics added ) is excellent here . And then there's this ending . Fassbinder has a talent for unique and notable endings , and the end of this film is one of the weirdest and most remarkable I've ever seen . .
384661	391152	120655	7.0	Kevin Smith's worthy diatribe over organized religion	Dogma is probably Kevin Smith's best film so far . It is extremely funny in the same vein as his previous films , and it does a rather good job discussing the confused state of Christianity today . I believe he comes up with a very good synopsis of the situation . The film , though , has some problems . The clashing of serious religious issues with both dirty , sometimes tasteless jokes and hardcore violence was severely jarring . Another problem is that the antagonists and their situation are more interesting than the protagonists . We've seen a lot of stories about people who had to rely in their faith as they are simultaneously losing it . Harvey Keitel's role in From Dusk Till Dawn , for example , was like this . There are also too many protagonists . What the heck did they even need Selma Hayek in the movie for ? She plays a Muse , a deity which isn't even Christian . Her character accomplishes little in the way of plot . The angels were much more interesting to me , and the film cuts away from them right when Bartleby , played by Affleck , and Loki , Matt Damon , both have vital character changes . They basically switch personalities , and the movie actually cuts to a standard scene where Linda Fiorentino questions her abilities ( the scene reminded me of the one in the Muppet Movie where Kermit the Frog went off from the other Muppets to ask himself if what he was doing was right ) . Also , the ending goes on for way too long , with six different characters each having their own reconciliation with God ( who actually contributes to the soundtrack ) . It goes on for so long , Smith had Jay and Silent Bob do something funny to keep the audience from growing restless . The biggest problem the movie has , though , is the abundance of explanation . Smith introduces so many different bits of Christian politics and beliefs that nearly a quarter of the entire film consists of characters explaining these things . I can appreciate the amount of detail that Smith included , but it detracts a bit from the film . Although I have a lot of complaints , the film did succeed in passing on its point , and it especially succeeds in being hilarious . If you did like his previous efforts , you will like this . And if you like Jay and Silent Bob , this is the film out of Smith's four that they figure the most prominently . There was a little disappointment in that Silent Bob did not give us any nugget of wisdom as he does in Clerks and Chasing Amy ( and Mallrats , if you count the blurb from The Empire Strikes Back ) . His two lines are pretty dumb . Anyway ,
385485	391152	58898	7.0	pretty but empty	This was the third Godard film I saw , and I saw it at a time when I was still eagerly building the base of my film knowledge . I found it dull and incomprehensible , but it seemed like interesting filmmaking ( at the time Breathless was the most amazing , original , and refreshing film that I had ever seen ) . It , and the second Godard film I saw , Contempt , put me off of the fellow for at least two more years ( I still need to see Contempt a second time ) . I finally fell in love with him on that fourth and fifth film , watched on the same night , Une femme est une femme and ( more particularly ) Vivre sa vie . After that I was a huge Godard fan , but it still took me almost two years to go back to Alphaville . I hoped that four extra years and about a thousand new films would have helped me appreciate the film ; either that or help me understand why the film wasn't any good . The verdict on this second viewing : it improved a little , but I still feel it's one of Godard's weakest films . By turns fascinating , silly , and just plain pretentious , Alphaville is at the very least an extraordinarily visually beautiful film . If I find the plot and themes somewhat trite , I can always marvel at the almost constantly artful black and white composition . Perhaps what the film really needed was a more interesting central character than Lemmy Caution , and a more interesting actor than Eddie Constantine ( whom I do love in Lars von Trier's Europa , which I believe was his last film ) . Caution / Constantine bored me , and I was constantly waiting for Anna Karina to reappear . Truth be told , she's not especially great , either . I've seen , I think , all but one of her collaborations with JLG , and this is easily her least interesting performance . Well , she's still pretty enough to look at . Again , beautiful , but , again , empty .
385110	391152	499554	7.0	Basically identical to the show	My first film of 2007 is a big screen port of one of my favorite television shows . I'll have to be honest : this doesn't seem like the kind of show that would lead to a very good big screen movie . Of course , Sacha Baron Cohen did a great job with his adaptation of his Borat character last year , and Reno 911 ! is similar in a lot of ways . It's not gonzo ( that means , all actors , no real people ) , but it is all improv comedy . Truthfully , I think the performers of Reno 911 ! ( most of them , anyway ) are far more talented than Cohen , and that the characters are funnier , at least when compared to Borat's segments from Da Ali G Show . Well , Reno 911 ! doesn't come close to surpassing Borat , but it is a pretty fun movie . Hit or miss , definitely , much more so than Borat , but its best moments are great . It is pretty much a direct port of the TV show ? they definitely could have made a three part episode about the team taking over the Miami police department ; they actually have had series of episodes in the past . Sacha Baron Cohen expanded his Borat character , which is why it was more successful .
385968	391152	98663	7.0	I love The Wizard . It's so bad .	Yes , this is the infamous 100 minute long Nintendo commercial , climaxing with the reveal of Super Mario Bros . 3 , which was released a couple of months afterward . It also has time to fit in commercials for Hostess deserts and Universal Studios theme park . Yet , for a commercial , it's not half bad . I admit , I like it 99 % based on misplaced nostalgia ( I was 10 when the movie was released ) . Not only was it about Nintendo , it starred Fred Savage ! I seriously didn't even remember Christian Slater was in it , nor Beau Bridges ( who is terrible pretending he knows how to play Nintendo , flailing at the buttons as he does ) . And the girl who co-stars is Jenny Lewis , now one of today's greatest musicians , heading the band Rilo Kiley as well as having a fantastic solo career . I would never have recognized her . The story's not that bad . As far as feature length commercials go , it's quite a bit better than Mac & Me . youtube . com / watch ? v = Ya0F83Bmbl4 .
384755	391152	60424	7.0	Passable Billy Wilder comedy ; the first pairing of the Jack Lemmon-Walter Matthau team	I'm not a huge Billy Wilder fan . I love Some Like it Hot , but was never too impressed with Double Indemnity and I really disliked Stalag 17 . I'm rather ambivalent towards The Fortune Cookie . I laughed a bit , but was also bored some of the time . It actually kind of lacks successful jokes . Walter Matthau , who won a deserved Oscar ( thought probably a sympathy Oscar , since he had a heart attack during the making of the film ) , plays the crooked lawyer who plans to milk an insurance company after his brother-in-law , Lemmon , a cameraman for the Cleveland Browns , is run down by a football player . Most of the best jokes are Matthau's . He has a lot of energy in the role and has a lot of great one liners as well as extended speeches . Jack Lemmon himself is good but had many better roles in his career ( look no further than to Some Like it Hot ) . He is still in love with his ex-wife who ran away with someone who promised her a singing career . She comes back to take care of Lemmon , but she's clearly a gold-digger . Ron Rich plays the football player who knocked Lemmon down . He's a little stiff , and , really , could they have found a whiter black man on Earth ? Much of the film's dramatics rely on his situation . He feels guilty for the injury , and Lemmon feels guilty for faking the injury and thus damaging the player's own confidence . These dramatic pulls never work well , though , since Rich is not all that good . There're also a lot of racial issues that are raised matter-of-factly - this was made at the height of the civil rights movement - and the casting of Ron Rich , who is so wimpy , sensitive , soft-voiced and light-skinned , is rather disingenuous . Still , at least the film is trying to show a friendship building between Rich and Lemmon . The film loses further pith because of the story . It's nothing special and it becomes , through the film's course , excessively predictable . Billy Wilder's direction is decent , but ordinary . The cinematography is pretty good and crisp black and white , but it may have seemed better in color . Really , all of my attention was focused on Matthau and Lemmon . .
385224	391152	452624	7.0	Worth seeing , but I wish it were better than it is	Soderbergh is a director with a decent amount of guts but not a lot of talent . Here he attempts to make a classic Hollywood film , reminiscent of The Third Man and Casablanca , by mimicking , or at least trying to mimic , the classical style of cinematography , by scratching the negative , having the dialogue recorded on mono ( I think ) , and having the actors deliver performances along the lines of the studio days . The gimmick honestly doesn't work all that well . Lovers of classic films will notice how different the film-making is from that of the ' 40s . How hazy the cinematography is compared to Casablanca or The Third Man ( it looks like you're watching a movie on a black and white television ) . Or how much more swearing and sexual content there is in the film . Yes , the gimmick is a weak one and somewhat detrimental to the rest of the film . Otherwise , it's a pretty good mystery . Not a great one . The pacing lags in the middle , and the mystery only starts to make sense right near the end , when much of the audience has stopped caring . The film's strongest asset is Cate Blanchett , who channels Marlene Dietrich . She is easily one of today's best actresses , and the only cinematographic triumph of the film is the lighting of her face ? she's drop-dead beautiful . I'll probably be hung by the nostalgists , but I'd take her ? in both her acting skills and beauty ? over the lead actresses of Casablanca and The Third Man . George Clooney is decent , but his character is fairly two-dimensional . He's a pretty boring hero . I really liked Tobey Maguire , though . His character was much more interesting , and I wish he could have been in the movie more . I absolutely loved the climactic sequence , but the film continues on for too long after that . Blanchett's big revelation at the end feels rather anticlimactic .
384794	391152	97940	7.0	I liked it ; I wish I liked it more	After falling in love with Jarmusch's most recent film , Broken Flowers , I thought perhaps the door would be open and I would learn to love the rest of his films . Unfortunately , watching Mystery Train , I feel the same distance that I have felt watching most of his other films . Don't get me wrong , there are some wonderful things about Mystery Train , and , overall , I liked it more than I did Stranger Than Paradise and Down by Law . But I always felt like I should be liking it a lot more , and I just never felt much more than a nice affection for the movie . The film contains three segments about people in Memphis , Tennessee . I especially liked the first one , which has two Japanese tourists there to visit Sun Records and Graceland . The second segment I liked less , which involves an Italian widow and a motormouth American she runs into . The third I liked slightly better than the second , and slightly less than the first . It involves three guys ( one of them being Steve Buscemi ) , one of whom has a loaded gun and is drunk ( who is not Steve Buscemi ) . All three stories meet up at a flophouse run by Screamin ' Jay Hawkins ( famous for recording the song " You Put a Spell on Me " ) and a goofy little bellboy played by Spike Lee's brother , Cinqué . I really liked those two . The whole film is mysterious and charming , with a bit of magic in the air , but somehow , for me at least , it didn't result in too much .
385025	391152	380066	7.0	Better than most of the junk horror that gets a theatrical release	Lucky McKee made one of the best horror films of the decade with May , but his followup was deemed unreleasable by the money men . That's very unfortunate . While it is no May , it's better than most of the schlock horror that makes a ton of money at the box office . It is a deeply flawed film . It's not entirely original . A troubled girl is sent away to an all-girls boarding school . The staff is creepy and are most definitely up to something . There are legends surrounding the school's history , and the recent string of student disappearances might have something to do with them . The film's biggest problem is its too-quick and confusing climax . It's loud , obnoxious , and unworthy of what has come before . The rest of the film is quite eerie . The acting is very good ( Agnes Bruckner plays the lead , and along for the ride are Patricia Clarkson and Bruce Campbell ) , and McKee's direction is generally wonderful . Perhaps a slight disappointment after May , but still a worthy followup . I have faith that McKee will go on to make more great films . Just hope someone deems them releaseable .
385461	391152	312859	7.0	Great first half , so-so second half	Touching Bollywood epic melodrama about a 10 year-old girl who finds out that she's adopted , and is determined to find her birth mother . The film's major success is the performance of P . S . Keerthana , who plays the girl . The first half of the film is very good . There are a few really good songs , too , especially the number that introduces the protagonist . Unfortunately , the film's second half , which takes place in war-torn Sri Lanka , feels like an entirely different , and disappointing movie . It's big on explosions and special effects , with Sri Lankan soldiers and rebels dodging grenades , running from fireballs , and being yanked by stunt wires . All the film can offer as insight are cheap platitudes like , " Some day there must come peace " and " Perhaps the children will find a way " . The final sequence , where the daughter and mother are reunited , is good , but so over-the-top with the music and a well-timed downpour that it feels like a cheat . I know , I know , it's all in the style of Bollywood . But this is a story where big moments simply detract from the simple , powerful central story . Bollywood could certainly use a little restraint at times , too .
384637	391152	1175491	7.0	An exploration of America's Nero	I , for one , liked it . The film is half a standard bio-pic , depicting much of George W . Bush's early life up until his Presidency . The other half takes place in the run up to the Iraq War , and continues until around the time the war starts to turn back on him . The stuff of the past is sometimes messy , but I liked that it attempted to understand Bush ( Josh Brolin ) psychologically . The film takes the stance , popular around 2004 , that W . ' s political career was a desperate attempt to win his father's love . The modern-day stuff is a lot more interesting and well done . It depicts the politics of Bush's first term . Stone has done a mostly excellent job of re-creating that cabinet , with Thandie Newton as Condoleeza Rice , Richard Dreyfuss as Dick Cheney , Jeffrey Wright as Colin Powell , along with several more . The make-up guys are the ones who do the best job here , but Dreyfuss and Wright are particularly great in their roles . The film isn't an especially deep exploration of the President ? I suspect we'll get many more thorough analyses of this undoubtedly fascinating man's life in the future . The film's major angle , that Bush was a well-meaning idiot who is easily manipulated , is a very common opinion , one that is not entirely supported by facts . But , really , who can know the entirety of a man ? W . is at least a good cursory examination of Bush .
385752	391152	401997	7.0	All for Cooper	Good true story about the biggest spy ever to infiltrate U . S . security . They caught him in 2001 , and I remember the story , though I didn't know the details . The film is mainly worth seeing for Chris Cooper and the complex character whom he plays . Cooper definitely gives one of the best performances by an actor of the year . A very subtle , very beautiful performance . Ryan Phillippe isn't quite able to hold his own against Cooper , but he acquits himself well enough . He certainly doesn't screw the film up or anything . I have a feeling that Phillippe is just about to break out as an actor . I really liked him in Flags of Our Fathers last year . Laura Linney was a big reason I wanted to see this film . She was praised for this performance , but I don't think she was given that much to do , honestly . I liked the film , but was far from loving it . That's probably because it pulled out one of my most hated cliché , that of the suffering , whining wife of a man who is busting his hump to save the world . She drags that old chestnut out , " I don't even know you anymore ! " Supposedly , this is pretty much the truth , but for Christ's sake , think of the greatness Eric O'Neil could have done if he had stayed in his position !
384805	391152	404203	7.0	Great setup , no payoff	An oddly toned film . I have been able to avoid the more intense discussions this has aroused , and I was barely at all aware that the film had comedic tones . As far as I can figure , the film posits suburban and married life in the realm of the Twilight Zone , via a deep-voiced , omniscient narrator . The narrator is something that most film audiences don't care for , but I don't think Field and novelist / screenwriter Tom Perrotta would have been able to capture the tone they did without it . So I personally thought that worked . I think the tone is really what makes the film memorable . The movie's steeped in awkwardness , but , at least for most of the film's run , it isn't awkward itself . The story begins well , and the characters are excellently realized and performed . Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson play the primary caregivers to their toddler children . They grow closer as they meet repeatedly at playgrounds and the public swimming pool , and soon begin an affair . The film's major subplot deals with a recently released sex offender ( played by Jackie Earle Haley ) who is being hassled by a former police officer ( Noah Emmerich ) . Haley's loving , elderly mother ( Phyllis Somerville ) tries desperately to protect her son . The main plot and the subplot tangle together in the end , and there is an attempt to relate the subplot to the main plot ( as per screen writing 101 ) , but it feels mighty forced . In fact , pretty much everything fizzles by the film's very weak ending . The strong story that had been built up , alas , has no satisfying resolution . I still think it's mostly a very strong film , though , with great direction by Field .
385847	391152	285175	7.0	Better than it's given credit for being , though certainly far from great	This movie was thrown out on DVD in 2005 without any real theatrical release . It's well pedigreed for such treatment , directed by famed documentarian Barbara Kopple ( Harlan County USA ) , written by late phenom Jessica Kaplan , " fixed " by famed screenwriter Stephen Gaghan ( Traffic ) and starring Anne Hathaway in her first serious role . The film is far from perfect , but it isn't nearly as bad as people have said . It's main problem is that it is undoubtedly exploitative . Hathaway and co-star Bijou Philips both get naked , the kind of naked that leaves the viewer feeling sleazy . The film is about a group of teenagers from upscale Los Angeles who like to play gangsta , pretending they're black or Latino . When Hathaway's boyfriend is threatened by a Latino drug dealer ( Freddy Rodriguez of Planet Terror ) , she is attracted to the more authentic gangsta scene . She becomes involved with Rodriguez , which leads to the titular havoc . While many of the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting , Hathaway's is well written , and she turns in the best performance of her career up to that point . She's nearly as intriguing here as she would later be in Rachel Getting Married . Also appearing is my favorite young actor of today , Joseph Gordon-Levitt , but he has a pretty weak role , so it's not worth watching just for him .
385413	391152	379865	7.0	Quite fun ; Zellweger is awful , though	Clooney's third directorial outing , and his followup to the Oscar nominated Good Night and Good Luck . This movie is quite a bit lighter , a screwball comedy about the early days of professional football . Clooney stars as a pro football player for the Duluth Bulldogs in 1925 . The sport is not very popular at this level , but is insanely so at the college level . His plan to increase attendance and save the sport is to recruit football and war hero John Krasinski , who plays for Princeton , onto the team , though college football players rarely go on to the pros . Meanwhile , a reporter from Chicago , played by Renée Zellweger , has discovered that Krasinski's war hero story is bunk , and plans to expose him . While never hilarious , it's quite an enjoyable movie . Clooney , I think , is a more talented director than any of his three films have displayed . I think , if he ever gets his hands on a great script , he'll knock out a truly great film . He captures the period detail well , and the photography is great . I think the film would be a whole lot better without Zellweger . I'm not necessarily a Zellweger hater , but she's staggeringly awful here and drags the whole film down a notch . I like the whole fin de siecle mood . Nothing especially memorable , but a good time .
385841	391152	959337	7.0	Well acted and made , but it's really just a turgid melodrama	Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet star in this film about an unhappily married couple . When they met , they were idealistic youths , but when they arrive in the suburbs , he working in sales and she a housewife , life seems dreary . The film offers no new insights on marriage or life . It is set in the 1950s , so you might think it's like , say , Far from Heaven in that it attempts to exploit the inadequacies of an era so beloved by a certain group of our society . But , no , Revolutionary Road doesn't make much of its ' 50s setting . I think it wants to be more universally about marriage . It's set in the ' 50s , I think , so there's a better reason these two people who just plain dislike each other have to stay together . So , taking place in the 1950s actually dates the problems that these couple are having for the most part . The story just doesn't feel relevant to a modern audience . Or me , at least . The film isn't that bad in the end . The acting is quite good , especially from Kate Winslet . Though I am a big fan of Michael Shannon , I found his two scenes in the movie very poorly written , mostly concerning his character , who comes off as a mere plot tool rather than a real person . The film is very gorgeous to look at , thanks to Roger Deakins , and I liked Thomas Newton's score ( he provided an even better one for Wall-E earlier in 2008 ) .
385820	391152	154683	7.0	Interesting , but I wish it were better	The kind of film that sounds really exciting , and is interesting , but you wish it were a bit better than it is . Its reputation is based mostly on the final 40 minutes , where all the characters take a vacation to the bowels of Buddhist Hell ( pretty much like Christian Hell , but with more lotus flowers ) . The first hour or so isn't much less hellish . A college student and his wicked friend mow down a drunk gangster in their car . The student , burdened with guilt ( somewhat nonsensical guilt seeing as it wasn't his fault ) , starts seeing tragedy occur all around him . In just the next several days , all kinds of people with whom he associates die . It's never his fault , per se , but for some reason he always blames himself . That first hour is a little boring and a little confusing ? I was wondering if the guy was supposed to already be in hell . The hell part is pretty cool , but also fairly silly . What always works in Jigoku is the cinematography and art direction . This is a damn cool looking movie . I wouldn't particularly recommend it , but it's worth seeing just for the cool parts .
385812	391152	71221	7.0	Were you also cheesed when Jim Kelly bought it in such a crappy way in Enter the Dragon ?	Well here's a movie for you ! Black Belt Jones is a must for aficionados of martial arts films , blaxpoitation films , and cult films in general . It boasts probably the funniest opening fight scene that I've ever seen ( unintentional or not ? it's difficult to tell in this film ; I have an acute feeling that everyone was just joking around and having a lot of fun ) , in which Jim Kelly aka Black Belt Jones ( one of the greatest character names in cinema history , to be sure ) ends the thing by shooting a bullet into a man's ass . It also boasts maybe the only fight scene where Scatman Crothers kicks some butt . And a scene where Jim Kelly kicks about a dozen guys out of train windows . And a set piece where everyone battles it out in a car wash with bubbly soap covering the scenery . The guy who plays Sidney also played the young black kid in The Omega Man , the one whom Charlton Heston tried to save . It also contains more abuse to the testicles than any film I've ever seen - none of the good guys have any qualms in the least about attacking the male package . If you see it with a bunch of guys , expect loud groaning all through the film . However much camp value there is , it does grow old during the course of the film . It's still a funny and distracting film .
385703	391152	83694	8.0	If not as good as if . . . and O Lucky Man , that doesn't mean it is worthless	This film completes the Mick Travis trilogy , of which the first two installments are if ? ( 1968 ) and O Lucky Man ( 1973 ) . You could say either that Britannia Hospital has little to do with the other two films or a lot . It depends on how you look at it . The political viewpoints are similar , but the style is much different . The three movies remind me much of Tati's first three Hulot films in the way they differ between each other while having interconnected themes . This would be Anderson's Playtime , in that , much like Hulot in Playtime , Mick Travis ( Malcolm McDowell ) becomes just one of a million different characters . Calling Britannia Hospital Anderson's Playtime oversells the film , unfortunately . The film does not work quite as well as if ? and O Lucky Man , both of which are masterpieces , in my estimation . Britannia Hospital feels like it ought to be a masterpiece . There are just so many flashes of genius . You see images and scenes that Federico Fellini or Luis Buñuel would have killed to come up with , and the film's liberal politics , while definitely somewhat confusing , are far more potent than anything Godard ever put forward . It also contains one moment of gorgeous eroticism , when Malcolm McDowell is changing clothes and a nurse gently cups both of his buttocks from behind . By the end , though , instead of being moved I was rather scratching my head . The film would probably benefit if I were to watch all three installments in a row , because there are apparently a lot of characters that are shared between them ( I only recognized Mick Travis and Professor Millar ; it's been over two years since I've seen the other films ) . But , then again , seeing how this film has been completely tossed aside by so many people , I'm hardly the only one who is confused . On the other hand , a film with so much ambition and power ought never to be shoved aside . Its dismissal is more than a little unjustified .
385887	391152	23876	8.0	Although not the best film of 1933 , certainly not an unworthy Best Picture winner	A sloppy but beautiful British family saga chronicling the lives of two families , the Marryots and the Bridges , the former upper class and the latter their servants , from the end of the 19th Century up to 1933 . A few major events are portrayed . At the beginning of the film , the patriarchs of the two families go off to fight the Boer War . Much later on in the film we experience WWI , and in between we see the Titanic sink . The film is filled to the brink with good characters , all of them being portrayed by very good actors , as well . There are a few very bad scenes , most notably the one on the Titanic ( I know it was an important event in this time period , but it's handled very poorly and predictably in the screenplay ) . The final speech , a necessary element in every film of this sub-genre , is particularly bad , too . The film ends during a worldwide depression , and there is a half-attempt to provide the audience with hope . Unfortunately , there is none to be found . I would have hated to be an audience member at this film in 1933 ! The many good scenes do far outweigh the bad ones , though . There are a couple that are really masterful . The very long montage that paints a portrait of WWI is gorgeously done , and appropriately harrowing . The scene in which the matriarch of the Marryot family watches her youngest son go off to war is exquisite . After he leaves , she attempts to light a cigarette . At that moment , a young nurse and a wounded man in a stretcher pass by ; the nurse lights a cigarette for the wounded man . The match goes out between the matriarch's fingers as she stares at them . This very economical scene expresses both the cold fear she has for her son and the ways in which the boundaries between the classes were fading . The theme of class in Cavalcade is important , although I wish it had been developed further . Early in the film , the Bridges family moves away and amasses something of a fortune of their own . As history marches on , we do see the class lines falter a bit . Cavalcade may actually have been an influence on none other than Jean Renoir , at least in The Grand Illusion . That film also deals with the melding of the classes as a result of wars . There is one scene in Cavalcade that is simply too close to one in The Grand Illusion to be a coincidence . A theater show is interrupted to announce that the Boer War is over and that the troops are coming back . Together , the audience members stand up and begin singing . It looks very much like the scene where the P . O . W . s sing " The Marseilles " in The Grand Illusion . .
384999	391152	120448	8.0	Well worth seeing	I was wary of this one . It seemed a lot like this trend in recent world cinema that I don't like , where the camera observes unemployed losers who do little besides screw , smoke , and ride around on mopeds not looking for jobs . These films rarely provide any interesting insights , or even interesting characters . So the subject matter had me prejudiced against this movie from the start . Fortunately , Dumont does have some insight into these people . I wouldn't say it's a lot of insight , nor would I say that the film has much new to say . However , the characters come off as real people . A couple of minor complaints : I thought that the lead actress , Marjorie Cottreel , was far too beautiful to fit in with the rest of this picture . And the hardcore sex scenes were entirely unnecessary . And I didn't need to see Mom's vagina , either .
384960	391152	37017	8.0	Tallulah Bankhead is TERRIBLE ! ! !	I can't believe that so many people thought Tallulah Bankhead was great in her role in Lifeboat . In my opinion , she drags down what could have been one of Hitchcock's greatest masterpieces . She chews up every scene with her over-the-top acting style . It becomes tiresome instantly . Her character is by far the least compelling of the group . I know Hitch made the film for her , more than anything , but it would be interesting to see someone remake this film and subtract that character . Why remake Psycho ? It's perfect . Remake one that is somewhat flawed . The rest of the cast is outstanding , however . I love Hume Cronyn . He's also great in Hitch's Shadow of a Doubt , and , of course , everything else he was ever in . I am not familiar with most of the other actors , but they're all great . Besides acting , Lifeboat is one of Hitch's most interesting films in every aspect . First off , it is historically interesting . For one thing , there is an ad at the very end of the film telling you to buy war bonds in the lobby ! If you've read the Truffaut interview book , Hitch explains how angry Americans grew over this film because of its depiction of the German vs the depiction of the Allies . This film is actually incredibly brave in this way . It definitely is not anti-Ally in any way , as some interpreted when the film was first released . There are plenty of references to the inhumanity of the Germans and just a lot of general enemy-bashing . But the film also criticizes aspects of our culture , especially materialism . In the best scene of the film , the Allies form a mob , or a pack of wolves , as Hitch himself has said , and kill their enemy . It is an incredibly great moment . The ending is also one of Hitch's most complex , although he was especially gifted for creating incredible endings . Anyhow , see this film , even if you are not a Hitch fan . It is in no way his standard fare ( the typical Hitchcock film being , in my thought , Ti Catch a Thief ) . , - 2 for Tallulah Bankhead's mega-ego and terrible performance .
384654	391152	297884	8.0	Moore is outstanding	I don't know if this film has anything all that useful or original to say . We know , or at the very least we've heard that 1950s folks didn't much care for homosexuals and black people . Todd Haynes is certainly not taking any brave new stands in this film . It's a tribute to Sirk , who would never overtly deal with these exact same subjects . But he did make a good study of racial attitudes in Imitation of Life in 1959 , so he was no coward . Fortunately , Far From Heaven does manage to work itself up to something quite worthwhile . The film is subtle in the same way as Sirk's were : throwing florid melodrama in your face while secretly depicting the truth under that cloud . Haynes probably wouldn't have succeeded half as well as he did if he weren't working with Julianne Moore and , to a slightly lesser extent , Dennis Quaid . Moore has been a powerhouse actress for more than a decade now , and this could be her strongest performance yet . I might prefer her in Boogie Nights slightly , but this is close . She's great as a sheltered 1950s housewife coming out of her protective shell . Her husband ( Quaid ) has been fighting his homosexual lust his whole life , and he's beginning to lose the battle . Rejected , Moore befriends her gardener , an educated black man ( Dennis Haysbert ) . It's not love , at least right away . Moore is just enthused to have found someone outside of her own world who understands her and will talk with her in an honest manner . The color cinematography , set design , and costume design are full of transcendent Sirk-influenced colors . Perhaps my favorite aspect of the film is the musical score , by Elmer Bernstein . It would be a shame to see it go without an Academy Award nomination . .
384609	391152	53168	8.0	Good , but overrated	This is the first Robert Bresson movie I've watched , and perhaps I did miss something . It is usually considered a masterpiece , one of the best films ever made . I personally liked a lot of it , found a couple of individual parts amazing , and felt unsatisfied when it ended after only 75 minutes . I don't know , it could even be an edited copy that I watched ( although I did see the New Yorker version of the VHS ) . I would like to praise over everything the performances , especially by the pickpocket himself and the woman who played Jean . They are both excellent . I also found the editing in a couple of the pickpocket montages remarkable . I give it an . If I hadn't been expecting a masterpiece , I might have liked it more .
384590	391152	787475	8.0	Utterly hilarious	I had flirted with the idea of seeing this film when it was in theaters , then again when it hit DVD , but somehow never got around to it . I don't even remember why I put it up at the top of my Netflix queue . Must have seen it referenced somewhere and my interest was renewed . I'm ecstatic that I finally caught up to it , though . It's hilarious ! This generation of Saturday Night Live is pretty dismal , but one of the few good things about it is Andy Sandberg and his digital shorts . They aren't always great , but they're weird and frequently inspired . He stars in this movie about a man who wants to follow in his dead father's footsteps and become a stuntman . In a very common plot for SNL players , Sandberg's stepfather is going to die if he doesn't get a heart transplant . That'll cost 50 grand , and Sandberg thinks that , if he completes one awesome stunt , he'll make the money needed . Much as all of the movies like this ( e . g . , Dirty Work , which starred Norm MacDonald ) , the plot is very secondary . Jokes are first . And jokes about the lameness of the plot are hugely encouraged . In fact , Sandberg only wants to heal his stepdad ( Ian McShane ) because he wants to kick his butt just once in a fair fight before he dies . Isla Fisher plays Sandberg's love interest , but his desires are thwarted by ultra-windbag Will Arnet , one of the funniest men on Earth . He brings this stereotypical character to ridiculous heights of meta-comedy . Danny McBride , Bill Hader and Jorma Taccone co-star as Sandberg's wacky crew . McBride and Hader have become sure-fire signs of a great comedy . There are so many great bits in Hot Rod : the crazy dancing Asian guy , Bill Hader's calm recollection of his acid trip , a fight between a taco and a grilled cheese sandwich , Sandberg " punch-dancing " his rage out . Little of it comes close to being describable . It's weird and wild , and sure to be something of a cult comedy classic .
385669	391152	86837	8.0	Certainly not on the level of 2001 , but it complements Kubrick's film well	I usually refer to 2001 : A Space Odyssey as my favorite film of all time . I always balked at this sequel , which I attempted to watch many years ago but gave up quickly . Finally watching it all the way through , I don't know what exactly I was objecting to so strenuously . I was afraid , I think , that this film would take away the mystery of the Kubrick film . It is true that 2010 is a much more straightforward film , but I'm happy to say it's far from stupid . It's actually quite intelligent science fiction . This film emphasizes a major but often overlooked theme of the first film , the Cold War . In 2010 , Dr . Heywood Floyd , here played by Roy Scheider , along with two other American scientists ( Bob Balaban and John Lithgow ) accompany a ship of Russian cosmonauts ( among them Helen Mirren ) to the moons of Jupiter on an expedition to recover the Discovery . The movie lacks 2001's sense of awe , but it has its own sense of dread that I quite liked . And while the climax and end are somewhat confusing , it kind of captures the mystery of the original film . This is hardly the insult to 2001 : A Space Odyssey I always expected , and in fact I think it compliments it quite well .
385543	391152	33874	8.0	Pretty funny	The Man Who Came to Dinner is a little uneven , but it's mostly entertaining . The unevenness comes mainly from the dullness of the budding relationship which the film holds in focus . The original play is very well written , especially the dialogue . It was actually performed at my high school when I was there . But its the cast here that excels . Monty Woolley is great in the titular role . He plays Sheridan Whiteside to absolute perfection . Bette Davis is quite good as his secretary , but the role is actually somewhat below her standards . I'm sure she took the role because she loved the play so much and was sure it'd be a hit , but that role is pretty dull . Ann Sheridan perhaps gives the film's most memorable performance as an egotistical Hollywood diva who's not sure whether she wants to marry British nobility for money or just chase around cute guys . Also noteworthy are Billie Burke as Mrs . Stanley , the Ohio society woman who invites Whiteside to dinner , Reginald Gardiner as an eloquent celebrity friend of Whiteside ( far underused ) , and the incredibly insane Jimmy Durante as Banjo . He comes into the film very late , but he very nearly steals the show . .
384766	391152	36969	9.0	Far more entertaining than I expected !	I love unexpected surprises . I was expecting a dull , 19th Century affair . Instead , I got one of the biggest melodramatic potboilers of all time . It's passionate , pulling me along and hardly letting me catch my breath . It's powerful , and it's actually hugely entertaining . Joan Fontaine plays the title character . Treated like garbage her whole life ( we follow a few of her childhood adventures ) , Jane finally ends up in a tolerable place , hired as a governess . Well , it might not be Heaven , but Thornfield is , if nothing else , an interesting place . A cute , little French girl ( Margaret O'Brien ) ; an overbearing master of the house ( Orson Welles ) ; creepy halls ; unexplained fires and a frightening entity hiding behind a gothic wooden door , bolted tightly shut . Heck , this film is a good 60 % horror film . 1943's best film , I Walked with a Zombie , is also based on the novel Jane Eyre . That film is pure poetry , but the 1944 version might actually be scarier ! The black and white cinematography is awe-inspiring , some of the best ever captured . It can be very , very eerie . It's actually inspired - perhaps even pilfered - by Orson Welles ' films to date . I wonder if he thought he was being ripped off ? The acting is not perfect . Joan Fontaine , as a thousand other people have probably pointed out , is anything but plain , as the character is supposed to be ( I've never read the novel - hell , I probably should now ! - but her plainness is expressed in the film ) . It's also easy to point out that she wears one expression throughout the film . However , I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing . The backstory is so well done that that expression seems to fit the character quite well . Orson Welles either seems to be not in the mood to star in this film or he seems too eager to be superb . I can't decide , but the result is curious . I wouldn't call it a bad performance , certainly , but it is not especially satisfactory , either . Whatever other criticisms could be expressed , he certainly never comes off as actually experiencing these situations with true emotions , unlike Fontaine . Perhaps the best performance in the film comes from young Peggy Ann Garner , who plays Jane as a young girl . She's simply amazing . Elizabeth Taylor appears in a small , uncredited role . Wow , she's young . All in all , I really loved Jane Eyre . While I recognize its imperfections , I wouldn't be surprised if my cable box gets stuck on Turner Classic Movies the next time it airs . .
385326	391152	167260	9.0	A legitimately great movie	An adventure movie to match the great ones of the past , and the one to beat for the future . The culmination of this ambitious trilogy is more than fitting ; it surpasses the first two films by quite a distance . Almost nothing disappointed or bothered me . All parts of the story were equally interesting . It was sweeping , it was involving , it was beautiful . One of the few thing I would complain about is the villain . Sauron is boring and more or less unseen . He does not feel very threatening . And his army of orcs has been dull since the first film . They're just not very interesting creatures . Fortunately , The Return of the King really makes up for these monsters with a gallery of better ones . Some of them have been present in the other two films , trolls and those flying dragons that the ring wraiths ride on . They're more present here , however . Even better , though , those gigantic elephants , ten times the size of a normal one . Oh , man , those are cool . Star Wars fans might grumble that they were too much like the AT-AT walkers from Empire , and they are . One scene where Legolas , the elf , triumphs over one of them feels like a sped up version of Luke Skywalker's attack . But the very best thing is a giant spider . Everyone knows that there was originally a giant spider on skull island in King Kong , cut from the film because it really disturbed a test audience . Seeing the spider in Return of the King is like having that famous piece of lost footage restored . When all three films are finally out on their special edition DVDs , I'm going to spend a month combing through them to see whether or not the entire series of films isn't just as good as this one , or perhaps as good as many of my younger friends have sworn they were .
384822	391152	162346	9.0	Bittersweet coming-of-age story	It's actually a bit difficult for me to pull myself out of this material . Enid's life is a lot like my own experience , or at least my own attitude , when I reached the end of high school . And now , half a decade later , I'm growing into Seymour at a rapid rate ( with movies instead of music ) . I imagine that Seymour is a lot like Zwigoff , and I feel like I must be like him . His misanthropy is very much like my own . You stare at everyone , and they all seem to fit into a specific slot so entirely well . The concept of individuality seems like a joke . How about the guy with the nunchucks ? A character who should have seemed like a gross cartoon , hell , can anyone honestly say they haven't seen people just like him ? You think you're the only person who differs at all from all the others . Do you hear the kind of crappy music they listen to ? The kind of bad films they watch ? But then , take a step back . That is what this film does for me . Seymour and Enid think they don't fit into a slot , but , well , unfortunately they do . Which is why I can so easily fit myself into their places at different times in my own life . And make sure to note that Seymour says to Enid several times during the film , " Yeah , I felt like that when I was your age , too . " Sometimes it's sickening how no one seems to differ . The film is not perfect , however . Enid's schitck does get old after a while . My biggest problem , though , is the ending . SPOILERS . The trip on the mystery bus seems like a poetic ending at first , but , really , to me it seems more like a cop-out . The film isn't exactly going for realism . There is a lot of exaggeration . However , I think that it needed a more down-to-earth ending , one where some sort of decision was made . That would show that Enid has passed a point of no return , that she has grown . That magical bus ride is nothing more than an escape , an easy way out , an evasion . END SPOILERSThis film was directed by Terry Zwigoff , who directed one of my favorite films of all time , Crumb . Crumb , in my not-so-very-humble opinion , is one of the most perfect films ever made , and easily the best documentary I've ever seen . That film was released in 1994 . Zwigoff made one documentary before that , I think in the mid-1980s , but I'm not sure . I haven't seen it , but perhaps I should seek it out . Anyhow , please , please , please , Terry , don't let another seven years pass before you direct another film . I'm pretty sure that Ghost World was relatively successful . It has been a critical smash , at any rate ( well , that hardly matters ) . Please , find something or write something that you find worthy and make another film out of it . Trust me , if you send out another one as good as this in a couple of years , you'll be a household name . .
384686	391152	61101	9.0	Sweet	Having previously seen Branded to Kill on its Criterion release , and having found it to be utterly brilliant , I had to buy the Criterion release of Tokyo Drifter . It is not as good as Branded to Kill ( heck , nothing can be ) , but it is still great . The color composition is particularly masterful . So what if the story is difficult to follow ? It is still entertaining . I really wish more of Sezuki Seijun's films would be released by Criterion , or anyone else , for that matter . He's an extraordinarily interesting and gifted filmmaker who is very underappreciated in cinema history .
384567	391152	65441	9.0	A vastly underrated film	Barbara Hershey plays a hippie girl who is hired to have the baby of a middle class couple ( Collin Wilcox-Horne & Sam Groom ) . The film deals with the clash of values between Hershey , along with her boyfriend ( Scott Glenn ) , and the couple . It also deals honestly and surprisingly fairly with the emotional turmoil all four characters go through . Supposedly the film was dismissed upon its released because of the way it depicted hippie culture , but it is much more positive than a good amount of the films of the day ( see Joe , for instance ) . It neither accepts nor dismisses either of the two classes , but instead deals with the four principals as individuals . The four characters are sensitively written ( director Bridges , most famous for writing and directing The China Syndrome , wrote the script here , as well ) . Hershey , Wilcox-Horne ( AKA Wilcox Paxton ) , Groom , and Glenn all give exceptional performances .
385450	391152	327597	9.0	Gorgeous and frightening	Every bit as good as Henry Selick's masterpiece , The Nightmare Before Christmas . Like that one , the film finds a perfect balance between beautiful and creepy . I would describe it as a children's horror film . In fact , I think this might go down as one of the scariest children's films ever made . The story is about a young girl , Coraline , who finds an odd doorway in her new house that leads to a mirror-image world , where her parents pay attention to her and give her anything she wants . It's wonderful , but odd ? everyone has black buttons for eyeballs . Coraline's first few trips to the alternate world are fun , but soon her " other mother " insists that she get her own buttons . The story is familiar . It reminded me a lot of Pan's Labyrinth and Spirited Away . The plot also takes a couple of obvious shortcuts that don't make a lot of sense . Fortunately , these things are hard to notice when you're watching Selick's eye-popping design . Pixar's got its work cut out for it if it wants to win Best Animated Film at next year's Oscar ceremony . It also has one of the most amazing musical scores I've heard in a while , by Bruno Coulais .
385897	391152	45070	9.0	Great pulp Western by the great Fritz Lang	Rancho Notorious is a gorgeous film , with beautiful Technicolor cinematography . It almost reaches the poetry of a John Ford film , or a great film noir , but falls just a little short . Arthur Kennedy plays Vern , a rancher whose fiancee is brutally raped and murdered . He goes out for revenge , following the clues . He ends up at Rancho Notorious , a hideout for outlaws run by Alder Keane , played wonderfully by Marlene Dietrich in one of her most memorable roles . She's fully in her philosophical mode here , like she was in Touch of Evil a few years later . She's so sad , so beautiful . She also has a great musical number . Mel Ferrer is also quite good as Frenchie Fairmont , a lethal cowboy who loves Alder . There are also a lot of great supporting actors playing colorful villains , especially George Reeves ( T . V . ' s Superman ) . The story is quite great . There are a couple of problems with characterizations , especially Vern . He's mostly great . He's mostly a noir hero , flawed in his own right but always believing that he's on an entirely moral quest . The film goes wrong when he becomes the romantic hero . He's too creepy . Dietrich simply dominates him . Mel Ferrer fairs much better in that way . The climactic sequence also disappoints . The other major flaw is that damn theme song . Rancho Notorious is pulp , it's very over-the-top , but that goofy song would make anybody laugh . Also , the name Chuck-a-Luck inspired a lot of laughs in the audience ( I was lucky enough to see it at a theater ) . Overall , though , Rancho Notorious is a great film , quite haunting in its own right . It's one of Lang's best , by my reckoning , up there with Fury and M . .
385518	391152	27752	9.0	Another enormously touching Ozu film	Incredibly gentle and touching Ozu picture about a single mother who works her butt off to send her only son off to school . Many years later , we follow her journey to visit that son in Tokyo . He hasn't kept in contact very well . His mother doesn't even know about his wife and infant son , nor that he is a grade school teacher , a rather low ( and low-paid ) position . Simply put , he's embarrassed at the little he has accomplished and he thinks his mother will be gravely disappointed that she went to so much trouble to educate him . The whole situation really hit home , and I was deeply moved by it . The film also features incredible cinematography and editing .
385556	391152	119823	9.0	A true gem , all the way	Just like when Jed Clampett was out shootin ' for some food , I thought that I'd watch this movie because I was hungry to see every single version of William Faulkner's fiction put to film . I expected possum stew , but , lo and behold , this was quite the bubblin ' crude . I mean , who would expect such a high quality movie to be made for television , a Hallmark Hall of Fame production , at that ? Well , the script was written by Horton Foote , most famous , I imagine , for his script for To Kill a Mockingbird . The original story is half of Faulkner's masterpiece If I Forget Thee , Jerusalem , which brilliantly alternates between the stories Old Man and The Wild Palms ( a name by which the novel has also been known ) . The Wild Palms is the better half of the novel , I think most people would agree . It's a tragedy about a woman who leaves her husband for a young man studying to become a doctor . The resulting scandal forces them to wander around the country , and the story ends with the gravest tragedy . Old Man , on the other hand , is a comedy . Where The Wild Palms presents a sickly and pained relationship , Old Man presents a parody of a marriage . A convict ( Arliss Howard ) is enlisted to help save people who are caught in the flood of 1927 , perhaps the largest the United States has ever seen ( it completely covered most of the South for miles on both sides of the Mississippi , and probably most other rivers , as well ) . He is specifically sent to rescue a young woman in a tree and a man stuck on top of the roof of a cotton house . Well , although he doesn't know how to control the boat , he does find the woman ( Jeanne Tripplehorn ) . He never finds the man on the cotton house roof , but he does find the woman in the tree , and she's eight and a half months pregnant . They get lost on the giant lake which was the South . Though the opportunity for escape , for a whole new life presents itself almost constantly , Howard refuses to take it . He's stubborn ; he only has nine more years to serve ( for a silly , attempted train robbery that barely got off the ground ) , and , dammit , he's gonna serve them no matter what . The movie consists of little more than muted conversations between the chattering woman and the convict of few words . A kind of love arises between them . This doesn't happen the same way in the original story . In fact , my sense was that the convict , who had been in jail since the tender age of 19 , had had no experience with women whatsoever and was downright afraid of both the woman and her baby , who is born in the first couple of days afloat . The comedy of this half of the novel is lessened and the work is made more dramatic . Without the tragedy of The Wild Palms , this actually works very well . The two lead performances are great . I would never expected this amount of depth from Tripplehorn , whose career has been middling at best . This proves her to be a viable actress . Arliss Howard , though I've seen him in a hundred movies , several of which are personal favorites , I do not recognize whatsoever . His performance in this film is nothing short of masterful , just magnificent .
385397	391152	906665	9.0	Weird and wild	Miike's best film since Gozu . It's an eye-popping , furious , hilarious pastiche of spaghetti Westerns . Of course , the spaghetti Western was invented by stealing from Akira Kurosawa , but then of course Yojimbo was invented from stealing from American sources , too . It goes back and forth and cuts across cultures . I'd definitely categorize this as a substance over style exercise , but , man , is the style a lot of fun here ! The story is pretty much the same as Yojimbo / A Fistfull of Dollars , with a mysterious warrior entering a town divided into two fighting factions . I think the biggest flaw in Sukiyaki Western Django is that the mystery man is not an especially interesting character . My attention was mostly on the wacky characters of the two factions . Doesn't matter too much , because , as I say , it's all style here . I enjoyed the crazy character design and spectacular cinematography . The action sequences are brilliantly directed and edited by Miike , and are some of the best gunfight sequences ever . My favorite bit has the leader of the white team ( yes , the two sides are divided by colors , red and white , to distinguish them visually ) shooting at the leader of the red team from a great distance . He has to aim his pistol high up in the air and at an angle to adjust for the wind and gravity . Quentin Tarantino has a small role . Don't let that scare you away . You're not going to be watching for the acting , either , as Miike has all of the Japanese actors speaking English phonetically , which just adds to the weirdness . Sukiyaki Western Django is a lot of fun , if you're game .
385600	391152	29751	9.0	I have to admit that I liked it a lot !	Surprisingly great John Ford film starring Shirley Temple . I was unsure if I could stand her cuteness for an hour and forty minutes , but I was never as annoyed as I expected to be . She's actually quite - good ( I'll probably never live that down , will I ? ) . Once in a while , she got a bit cloying , but for the most part I enjoyed her performance . Believe me , though , John Ford and his screenwriter were careful to balance her with the rest of the film , which is indeed quite masterful . All of the other performers are pitch perfect , including C . Aubrey Smith , Cesar Romero , Michael Whalen , Constance Collier , June Lang , and especially Ford regular Victor McLaglen . He's amazing , as always . The story , based on a Rudyard Kipling book , is very good . Lang plays Temple's mother . Her husband has apparently died , and she accepts the gracious invitation of her father-in-law ( Smith ) , a colonel in India , whom she has never met . While there , Temple becomes a sort of a mascot of the soldiers , with Sgt . MacDuff ( McLaglen ) taking care of her and teaching her how to be a soldier . Another soldier ( Whalen ) courts Temple's mother . Cesar Romero plays Khoda Khan , a bandit prince who is being held prisoner in the fort . Ford's direction is as exciting as ever , and the cinematography is halfway between the expressionism of The Informer and the naturalism of Stagecoach . The musical score is also quite good . One might object to the colonialist viewpoint of the film , but , to be fair , Wee Willie Winkie is a lot more palatable in that respect than George Stevens ' much more famous Gunga Din is . .
385248	391152	215545	9.0	A fireball of a movie	I am absolutely embarrassed right now that I have never watched a Spike Lee film before . I have always wanted to see Do the Right Thing , which is generally considered his best film , and I even rented it once , but never got around to watching it . When Bamboozled opened last year , it sounded very interesting , but after the critics dismissed it as a failed attempt at satire , I decided to catch it later on , perhaps after I saw Do the Right Thing . Then I saw it was going to be played on television , so I found the time and sat down to watch . What I saw was something absolutely amazing . And that's not to say that Bamboozled doesn't have its flaws . I would personally deem it a flawed masterpiece , a very flawed masterpiece . The critics were right : Lee's satire is misplaced . He's far too hotheaded an artist to have realized this immediately , but he should have when the New York Times refused to run the movie's add , which depicted a sambo character eating a watermelon , because they feared protests . Bamboozled asks us to suspend our disbelief - a disbelief which Spike Lee may not have had himself - and accept that a TV network would produce the New Millennium Minstrel Show and that the public , a la Mel Brooks ' The Producers , would eat it up . Lee's argument in the press is that this was already happening . His targets were rap videos and a show on the WB network that only produced something like 6 episodes ( the show was about Abe Lincoln's black servant who single-handedly ran the country ; Lincoln was the buffoon ) . The reason that the New York Times didn't run Lee's add is the exact same reason Lee wrote the film in the first place : African American political activists , including Lee , often have very knee-jerk reactions to such things . The show about Lincoln , which Lee argued was set during the " holocaust " of his people , actually showed the white people to be the buffoons and the blacks to be their manipulators . He missed the point ( which could very well have been due to the fact that the show sucked anyhow ) . Add to this the fact that , besides clips of Good Times and The Jeffersons , both of which , I ought to add ( in my own opinion ) , Lee is taking out of context ( he would have been much better off to feature Diff'rent Strokes , which is somewhat offensive ) , all of the clips he uses to demonstrate the abuse of his race must have been downright difficult to dig out of film archives . None of these cartoons or movies that are shown , nor most of the sambo toys , have been seen for some thirty years or more , most probably not since before Spike Lee was born . We all know they exist , and , as Sloan ( Jada Pinkett Smith ) says in the film , we oughtn't to forget whether we're black or white , but it doesn't work as satire to show these things . They aren't at all harmful now , not until you drag them up again . Then they're only offensive when knees start jerking . None of this matters , in fact . Not to me , anyway . In my opinion , film today has become far too complacent . Bamboozled is an enormous jolt to our current , apathetic world . The fight may be misdirected and wholly fabricated by a paranoid man , but Spike Lee is indeed a masterful director . In fact , I would very favorably compare this film to Jean-Luc Godard's Le Week-End , which was also somewhat misdirected in its satire . Both of these films are excellent . Bamboozled moves with a speed and passion almost completely foreign to the world of filmmaking today . It's angry , it's brazen , and it makes your heart pound with fear , sadness , and intensity . It also raises more difficult issues than any film I've seen in a very long time . It manages to do this while remaining funny , too , although I was always wondering whether Spike Lee would slap me for laughing at this stuff . I especially loved the Tommi Hilnigger Jeans commercial . But even the New Millennium Minstrel Show is presented in a humorous way . A lesser artist , I believe , would have made it more clearly offensive . As it stands , it's difficult not to laugh at Mantan and Sleep-N-Eat ( probably the most jaw-droppingly funny and ballsy name I've ever heard ) as they perform . Tommy Davidson and Crispin Glover put enough energy in these stage performances to electrocute you . Their performances are awesome - often the dialogue they do have is cliched , but in many small moments their faces clearly express , and subtly , too , how their lives are crumbling . I would also like to compliment Jada Pinkett Smith , who turns in the film's finest performance . I have a feeling she's just going to get better and better , if someone would give her another decent role . Michael Rapaport , although perhaps a little too cartoony , is still very funny . Damon Wayans has the most difficult part . I'll bet money that he and Lee KNEW that the critics would immediately jump on Wayans ' fake white accent . I can't imagine they thought it was all that funny or believable . However , I'm not sure why they did it . It does detract a little from the film , though not as much as many critics claimed it does . Personally , I would have either had that accent fade as the film went on . It sounds especially bad when it comes back at the end , after all those powerful ( if pointless ) scenes of African Americans in the cinema . Although , as that very phony voice is brought back , we recall the way the film began . . . Other aspects of the filmmaking are excellent as well . I have already praised Lee's direction . It is quickly paced and he really knows how to move his camera . The editing is fantastic . A powerful rhythm is established right away and never abandoned . In fact , the film pulls a daring change from satire to melodrama about halfway through , another aspect of the film that people complained on end about . It is all done with gusto , especially in the editing . The cinematography - wow ! This and Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark show how worthwhile digital video is . Lee and his DP use it to an amazing degree ! When characters are moving fast , which happens most often when Mantan is tap-dancing , a blur is left on the screen for a split second . Late in the film , when Mantan is trying to free himself from the show , Lee causes these blurs to remain onscreen for a prolonged period of time . The effect is simply powerful . One major complaint I have is the score . It's often manipulative . I think it would have been better to have had a minimalist score , which would have made the film seem even more immediate . Like I said , there are many major and legitimate complaints against Bamboozled , but critics and audiences forgot what's going for it : it is EXCELLENT CINEMA . .
385645	391152	57261	9.0	You really couldn't hope for a better film version of the novel	And saying that , I also should clarify that I've never seen more than a few minutes of the 1990 remake . I have read the novel , though . It is good , but its none-too-subtle parable make it sort of a weak read to an adult . I was 15 when I read it , and I thought it was obvious then . As far as the prose goes , it could have been written by an intelligent teenager . Peter Brooks , when adapting the novel into this film , decided to go with a cinema-verite style , obviously influenced by early French New Wave films like Breathless and The 400 Blows . What results is amazing : an immediate and believable telling of events . The amateur actors are excellent , and cast to perfection . The cinematography and editing make the film much more frightening than the novel was . All in all , the only real problem is the often inappropriate scoring , especially at the film's end .

I think it wins the award for the most profane and pornographic film ever made , beating the hell out of its closest competitors like The Night Porter or In the Realm of the Senses . However , I think Salo is a better film than those two . Pasolini actually has some sense of artistry , and , if you can stand it , Salo is actually a very well made film . It's agenda is nothing but a front - yes , we already know that fascism is bad . No , this film reveals much more about its own creator than anything else . It's a playground for his fantasies . But I believe he must have known that . The plot proceeds very logically and the suspense and horror grow exponentially . Pasolini knew that he who had free reign would end up going too far . The final act is as brilliant as it is stomach-churning , and it's no coincidence that the President and many of his top-ranking men only watch it indoors with binoculars . I think this wins the contest for the best movie that you can hardly bring yourself to watch . .
385183	391152	53298	9.0	Surprisingly excellent !	A surprisingly excellent adaptation of my very favorite novel , William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury . A lot of things are changed - and I mean A LOT - but I would much rather see something new than a slavish adaptation of a great novel . Besides , Faulkner's novel would probably be impossible to adapt as written . The book shifts back and forth in time without warning . It can do that . Literature exists in the mind , while a film exists before the eye . Like Ritt's other Faulkner adaptation , 1958's wonderful The Long Hot Summer , based on The Hamlet , the mood is changed from dusty , Southern tragedy to hot-blooded melodrama . I would have been upset to hear that said about The Sound and the Fury , but it works out nearly perfectly . The narrative is made linear , and many of the distant past events in the novel are either removed or adapted into the latest time period of the book . The girl Quentin Compson ( Joanne Woodward ) is a wild teenager , and her uncle Jason Compson ( Yul Brenner ) , who is taking care of her because her mother , Caddy , ran away after she gave birth , is cruelly taking care of her . Jason is a little different in the film . Instead of being one of the Compson children , he is a stepson . Caroline Compson was the second wife of the other Compson children's father . She and Jason are now Cajun , which is kind of weird , but it works . The male Quentin is more or less cut out , except for a brief mention . In this version , true to its melodrama , Quentin shot himself instead of jumping into a river . His was always my favorite section of the novel , and I'm actually glad they set it aside . It's not very cinematic . Benji is still here , but his section of the novel is completely cut out . First person narratives are difficult to do in films , so I don't blame the screenwriter . Benji quietly watches his family fall apart and he seethes in silence as he watches his niece follow in her mother's tragic footsteps . There's also a new Compson child , Howard . He is probably the biggest mistake that was made in this adaptation . He's kind of a compilation of Uncle Murray and the first Quentin . He has become an alcoholic because of his obsession with his sister's sexuality . The problem is that he is only barely incorporated into the film . I was always wondering who the heck he was until they explained him more completely later on in the movie . I guess he doesn't harm the overall product that much . SPOILERSOne big change in character in the film is the second Quentin . She wasn't very sympathetic in the novel . Sure , we could feel sorry for her , but she's a rebel and she's heading for disaster , or , more correctly , non-existence . She vanishes at the end of the novel and is never heard from again . Here , though , Quentin is a more important character . She's the center of the film , and while she's bad in some ways , she's got potential . Jason is very mean to her , but it's not the jealousy and revenge that it was in the novel . He does care for his adoptive daughter , but he really doesn't know how to behave around women or children . His purpose is to prop up the decaying Compson family . There's also an edge of sexual attraction in the film . Caddy , in the film , comes back home to live . She reveals that when Jason first arrived in the Compson household , he had a crush on her . This crush has also fallen on Quentin . Did this exist in the novel ? I never thought it did , but the film has made me reconsider some things about the book . We know the first Quentin is sexually obsessed with his sister . Benji is also obsessed , although I never thought it was a sexual thing . Is Jason also obsessed in the novel ? I don't know , but I'll be looking for it the next time I pick it up . The ending has some problems . So did The Long Hot Summer . Both endings are happy , or at least partly so . I had said that Quentin originally ran away . In the film , she almost does , but Jason convinces her not to , that she has potential . It works well . However , the night before Quentin runs away in the film , Benji strangles her when he catches her being bad . For this , he is sent to the insane asylum . This doesn't happen in the novel . He does attack a high school girl when she walks past the gate because he thinks she's Caddy . For this he is neutered . And Jason does send him to the asylum , but not in The Sound and the Fury . Its just that the sadness of Benji's commitment still hangs over the film when it ends , but you wouldn't quite know it if you just saw the ending .
384919	391152	25590	9.0	Great Fields , Great Entertainment	If anything , this film is a must-see for two of W . C . Field's scenes : 1 ) Fields ' first meeting with Baby Le Roy ( who also appears in It's a Gift ) , which is easily one of the best comedy scenes in the movies , and 2 ) Fields ' juggling routine , for which he was very famous when he was a vaudevillian , justly so . There are several other great moments of slightly lesser value . Also , the plot and the supporting characters are consistently entertaining and endearing , so this one's a real winner .
385862	391152	35937	9.0	A brilliant thriller	A brilliant thriller . It's not as beautiful as some of the other Val Lewton movies ( I really think the director must make a difference ) , but the script makes up for any lack in such a quality . Apparently the story was stolen ; a subsequent lawsuit is the reason that this one is so rare . The film concerns a ship's third officer going on his first voyage as an officer . The captain ( Richard Dix ) takes him under his wing and tries to teach him his philosophy about authority . At first , the third officer is receptive , but it soon becomes apparent that Captain Stone believes that he has the power over his sailors ' lives or deaths . To prove this , he purposely leaves a heavy metal hook loose at night . The sailors are forced to risk their lives to tether it down . Later , when one expresses a very formal complaint about the Captain's ignoring procedures , the Captain locks him in the small room where the men are reeling in the anchor's chain . The third reports the Captain's apparent insanity when they get to port , and , to his surprise , the rest of the ship's crew , even those who were his friends , turn against him . Of course , the third is forced to quit to avoid embarrassment . Unfortunately , through an almost hilarious ( although entirely believable ) set of circumstances , he ends up back on the ship . Captain Stone seems a little too eager to have him aboard , and he has to fight for his survival . Richard Dix is just wonderful as the demented Captain Stone . The touch with the mute sailor - who narrates through this really creepy internal voice - is clever . I'm almost shocked at how well that worked ! The final confrontation is exciting , as the Calypso singer Sir Lancelot ( who also appeared in 1943's I Walked with a Zombie , easily my favorite of the five Val Lewton films I've so far seen ) sings a pacific tune . .
385909	391152	15324	10.0	Almost certainly the funniest comedy I've ever seen .	Yes , counting all the comedies I've ever seen , silent or talkie , this is probably the funniest . I was lucky ( boy , was I lucky ! ) to see this in a theater with a live piano player . Ever scene is brimming with comic genius , cinematic inventiveness , and just plain perfection . I laughed almost nonstop from beginning to ending . Jokes that seem liked they lasted 10 minutes were funny for their entirety . After the performance was done , I think the audience clapped for 10 minutes , and they ( the pianist and Buster Keaton ) deserved at least that much , if not an hour more .
384719	391152	112767	10.0	One of the best films I've seen in a while	The setup sounds a bit like The Bicycle Thieves , with a poor Saigon teenager getting his rented bicycle-taxi stolen by a group of gangsters . I was pretty sure this was going to be a film of the " sucks-to-be-poor " genre so common throughout foreign cinema , but Cyclo veers into much darker territory . The teen is forced into crime by the woman from whom he rented the bike , and falls in with a gang she operates ( lead by Chinese actor Tony Leung Chiu Wai , the most familiar actor in the cast ) . Meanwhile , the teen's sister gets involved with Tony Leung , as well , becoming his girlfriend , as well as his prostitute . The film plays this all as a nightmare , which it doesn't spell out all at once . The shift in tone from neorealist to abstract is at first difficult to perceive . Much like its characters ' dilemma , the film sneaks up on the viewer and catches you from behind . You never know what's hitting you . The hypnotic mood engrossed me completely . The film reminds me a lot of the work of Tsai Ming-Liang , one of my favorite modern directors . This vision is actually more horrifying than any of Tsai's films . Where Tsai stresses loneliness in the big city , Tran makes Saigon feel overcrowded and the mood is akin to paranoia .
385730	391152	59012	10.0	In desperate need of restoration . We should start a charity fund .	It has grown mythic in my mind since several Europeans that I talkto on the internet began to tell me many months ago that Chimesat Midnight was an Orson Welles film that they preferred even toCitizen Kane . Yet it was unavailable in the US , and I thought that Iwould never see it . But finally I found a copy at a local alternativevideo store . I must say , to suggest that it beats Kane is giving it more creditthan it deserves . That film is today generally considered the verybest ever made ( on my own list , the latest version , it lands at # 12 ) , though that status was hard fought over those who overrate thecastrated version of The Magnificent Ambersons , though that filmis indeed , too , a masterpiece in its own right . But Chimes atMidnight is itself also a small masterpiece . Considering howcheaply it seems to have been made , the results are jaw - dropping . It is among Welles best , though saying that is asredundant as saying a play is ranked highly in Shakespeare'scanon . I have to confess to not knowing much about which Shakespeareplays Welles was using ; I don't have the necessary research toolsas I write this . I believe that he used a mixture of several plays , butnothing in the film seemed familiar to me , who have read only aquarter of them . Whatever Welles did , though , the results areamazing . His direction and editing give the film an enormouskinetic energy . The famous battle scene , the centerpiece of thefilm , ranks among the best ever created on film ( I would saycaptured , but Welles , presumably on account of the low cost ofproduction , creates the tension and fury of it by editing mostly , notcinematography or complex direction ) . Welles the actor is at thepeak of his form , though that is redundant , too . Did Welles evergive a bad performance ? I haven't seen too many outside of hisown directorial efforts , but the few I have seen I must concedewere beyond excellent . One other mention of acting : what the hellhappened to Jeanne Moreau ? Was Orson Welles stealing hermeals ? For Christ's sake , she looks like she's dying . I've seen six of the , what , ten or eleven films that Welles directed . Five of those I've given a , including Falstaff . Only Macbeth , which I felt paid too much attention to the technical aspects andnot enough to the actual play ( although it was only the secondWelles film I saw and that was a while back ) , I have given lessthan that , a . Falstaff I rank fifth out of the remaining five ( inorder : Citizen Kane , Touch of Evil , The Trial , The MagnificentAmbersons ) . Perhaps I would rank it as highly as my Europeanfriends do , but there is one issue that may be destroying itsbrilliance : the tape that I rented was in the most awful condition . Generally , my credo is that I won't watch a direct cinematicadaptation of a Shakespeare play unless I have read the original , but lately I have noticed that I can understand his dialogue quitesufficiently . However , as Shakespeare is difficult to comprehend byear alone , imagine hearing Shakespearean dialogue spoken byCharlie Brown's teacher ! As the print I saw was terrible , voices aresometimes impossible to understand . I think I only caught around of the dialogue , which made the plot somewhat difficult tofollow . The picture's contrast was quite bad , too , but notunbearable . The sound was definitely the biggest wound the filmhas received . But as films are being restored every day , andWelles's importance has never been denied , we must pray thatthis one is on someone's agenda . I pray for a Criterion edition witha great commentary track on the side that can decipher everythingI'll miss .
385621	391152	85838	10.0	One of Sayles ' very best films	Sayles ' second feature as director , and his first great film . It's not perfect , has its share of clichés and is certainly dated , but it's wonderful . Linda Griffiths stars as Lianna , a young mother of two who is constantly suffering under her smarter , controlling husband , a film professor ( Jon DeVries ) . Lianna doesn't have much of a life , but she manages to sneak in a night class twice a week . She develops what seems to be a non-romantic crush on her professor ( Jane Hallaren ) . When her husband cheats on her , the relationship with her professor changes to a sexual one . It would be easy to hold the fact that Sayles is a man against the movie . However , Sayles does here what he does best : create strong , identifiable characters for whom we care . Lianna is really one of the best developed characters I can remember . I absolutely love the way Sayles makes her intellectually inferior to both her husband and lover . It gives her struggle a lot of weight . And I love the line she says to her husband : " Just because you can argue better doesn't mean you are right . " She breaks my heart . The power structure between her and her husband is brilliantly written . I also liked that Sayles creates a new power structure , and not one wholly different from the marriage , between Lianna and her lesbian lover . My only complaint is that Sayles does sometimes treat Hallaren's character too kindly . She's clearly taking advantage of Lianna , and at times she's clearly treating her badly . In fact , the relationship starts exactly the same way as the relationship between Lianna and her husband . She was once his student , as well . The parallel isn't underlined as well as it should have been . I think Linda Griffith's performance here is one of the best ever . It's a tragedy that she didn't become famous after this . I know that Sayles isn't the greatest director ( specifically referring to the direction ) in the world , but this is some of his best work on that front ( his very best is certainly Matewan ) . Of course his greatest talent is his writing ; he is such a remarkable writer of human interrelationships . Sayles also gives his best performance as an actor in this film . Lianna is such a subtle work of human emotion . It really doesn't have any big moments , and it doesn't end with any clear resolution . The film's power only hit me about 20 minutes after it was over . It's a small masterpiece .
385233	391152	30448	10.0	Probably the best of all the Mickey Mouse shorts	I was obsessed with this cartoon when I was a child , and now that I have the new DVD box set " Mickey Mouse in Living Color , " I can watch it every day ! This is just filled to the brim with some of the funniest jokes Disney ever created . The animation is simply gorgeous , as it always was in this era of Disney Studios . .
384610	391152	66434	10.0	One of the best of its sub-genre and probably the best movie George Lucas has yet ( read " ever " ) directed	Sure , Star Wars is a lot of fun . It's a great way to waste some time or to keep people entertained at a party or something . However , it's unbelievable how crazy people have become about it . In fact , people are so insanely in love with it that they actually convinced themselves that The Phantom Menace was a good movie . Now that's the power of persuasion ! Let's travel back in time three entire decades . In 1970 , George Lucas made his first feature after graduating from film school . Francis Ford Coppola , two years away from capturing one of the greatest films ever made , helped young Lucas produce it . It is THX 1138 , which is the name given to the film's hero , played by Robert Duvall , who was not yet extraordinarily famous ( perhaps people would recognize him from Robert Altman's MASH , in which he had co-starred earlier that year ) . The setting is a post-apocalyptic , underground complex . I have to throw out a caveat right here : I'm a sucker for post-apocalyptic movies , and generally like all of them . And , in my opinion , this is one sci-fi sub-genre where the cheaper a production is , the better it is . My favorite ever is L . Q . Jones ' 1975 cult classic A Boy and His Dog . Heck , I even liked Robert Altman's Quintet quite a bit . What I like about these three films , what they have in common , is that they don't spend a lot of time explaining their back-stories . A Boy and His Dog gives a brief account of the major event in its history , but does not explain what came afterwards . THX 1138 is surely much more widely known than either A Boy and His Dog and Quintet , simply because of its creator . Lucas ' film gives us hardly anything to establish its setting in time . Of course , as conventions would determine , we all assume that it was some nuclear holocaust or unbearable pollution . But Lucas really gives us little information about what is going on . When sub-genres get so specific like this , where one film is so close to its predecessors , whether those predecessors are films or even novels ( no one could mistake the 1984ish tones of the film ) , the screenwriter and director really don't have to tell us much . So if these films are so close , why should anyone like them ? Well , because you're not supposed to rely wholly on the plot for the films ' worth . This is cinema , not literature . What we have to pay attention to is , well , one , the narrative structure , that is , how the story develops , not what the story is ( that's a part of literature , too , but it's a good variable in this genre ) . Two , these stories do differ in their settings , which is a major part of the authors ' creativity . Three , cinematic techniques . Well , THX 1138 can be credited with having a very good structure . It does progress linearly , but , as I said above , it gives just the tiniest hints of what's actually happening in the film and what the characters are thinking . There is very little dialogue , and a lot of it is difficult to decipher . The setting : George Lucas has great success here . He has all the sets as white as possible , and these sets mostly consist of hallways . Very cheap , and very effective . This comes in a lot if you're going to discuss the cinematography . Lucas also makes his characters wear white , scientific outfits , often covering everything but the characters ' heads or faces . In possibly the best sequence in the film , Duvall is put in a prison that has no visible walls or corners or doors or anything . It's just pure white , and it's simply deafening . And since the prisoners are wearing white , too , it looks like they're all lost in some sort of hideous limbo . Lucas also creates the best visual compositions in his entire career . Star Wars is rather bland visually . Nice colors , I suppose , but there's hardly any attention paid to composition . I was lucky enough to see THX 1138 in widescreen , and Lucas very carefully composed the shots . He's especially good here at posing his actors in an artistic way , while not making it obvious that he had deep artistic intentions when directing them . To tell you the truth , I couldn't relate what actually happens in this story at all . I have to blame part of that on my sleepiness tonight . However , even when I didn't fully understand it , I recognize it as a great movie , a masterpiece , perhaps . .
384578	391152	74235	10.0	Passionate , poetic , exceptional filmmaking	At its base , Bound for Glory is just a simple biopic about Woody Guthrie . In execution , it turns out to be a lot more . We actually learn very little about Woody Guthrie's life . I don't know the exact statistic , but I would guess that it covers no more than a few years , with an end title that tells us briefly of his death . And basically all of the experiences shown onscreen can be seen in other films , most notably John Ford's brilliant American masterpiece The Grapes of Wrath . To be absolutely fair , the scenes of migrant workers ' woes are at least equal to those in its predecessor . A good one-line summary of Bound for Glory might read " a modernist equivalent of The Grapes of Wrath told from the point of view of folk singer Woody Guthrie . " But Bound for Glory has a few things that make it stand out from other films , that make it as memorable as The Grapes of Wrath . First and maybe foremost , you have the brilliant and gorgeous cinematography of the great Haskell Wexler . I'm no expert on cinematographers , but Wexler is one of only three I can name offhand ( the other two being , if you are interested , Vittorio de Sica and Sven Nykvist ) . I love Wexler's work in films like Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? and Matewan ( a thematically similar film directed by the great John Sayles ) . But what Bound for Glory most resembles is Wexler's very controversial cinematography on Days of Heaven . Not controversial because of anything specifically photographed , of course , but , if you know the story , a different cinematographer took credit as lead DP , leaving Wexler with a credit that was something along the lines of " with additional photography by " . Wexler claims to have photographed more than 50 % of the scenes in the finished film . He has sat through the film several times , I have heard , with a stopwatch . Bound for Glory , at any rate , is one of the most beautiful films you're ever likely to see . It's golden colors are beautiful , and the camera is moved gently , but with precision . This film actually has the first shot that used a steadicam , although I had forgotten to keep an eye out for it when the film was playing ( I was far too engrossed ) . My favorite scene is one where Guthrie and a black hobo have left the boxcar of a train and move to the top of it . There they sit and converse as the most beautiful landscapes in our country pass by behind them . These are some of the best shots I've ever seen . And just because of those shots , even if the film didn't contain a plethora of other relevant materials , I would call this film one of the best ever made about the United States . Secondly and thirdly , this film is about Woody Guthrie , one of the greatest American artists of the past century . David Carradine , who , in other performances , has never convinced me that he was as good as his father , John ( who was in Grapes of Wrath , incidentally ) , or his brother , Keith , breaks apart my former opinion of him and delivers a masterful performance . I don't know whether I could identify why he is so good in this film . It's as if he has an aura about him . He really does , however , seem to enbody Guthrie's convictions . Throughout the film , Guthrie's music is played , whether sung or as an extra-diagetic score . This is great American music . So much of it has become part of the soundtrack to the American life . I mean , I remember learning songs like " This Land is Your Land " and " This Train " in elementary school music class . In his day , Guthrie had difficulty in getting those kind of songs out to the public . His bosses were constantly ordering him to tone down the political edge of his music . Luckily for America , he steadfastly refused to do so . Woody Guthrie was a true American hero . Bound for Glory depicts that as much as he could have hoped for .
385918	391152	140384	10.0	An S & M masterpiece ; Please , release more stuff like this !	A discovery like this reminds me how much more there is to Japanese cinema besides Kurosawa , Ozu , and Mizoguchi . Well , my two favorite Japanese filmmakers are Sezuki Seijun and Shinya Tsukamoto , maverick filmmakers in their own country . Yasuza Masumura may be thrown on that list pretty quickly here , although this production doubtlessly had more money than , say , Branded to Kill . I won't go into too much detail with Blind Beast . Suffice it to say that it's one of the best films I've ever seen . It's easy to compare it to some vaguely arty trash like In the Realm of the Senses ( and I say that in the best way ) . That film was discovered by the French . I wish they would have found this and canonized it instead . It's far more artistically accomplished , and much , much more emotionally and physically draining . .
385222	391152	366721	10.0	Angelopoulos can do no wrong	I think anyone familiar with Angelopoulos knows what to expect with his films : long , drawn out , meticulously planned shots that slowly scan environments , with the image composed of not only the foreground but hundreds of yards into the background . I guess some are not impressed with the director's style , but that really astounds me . I definitely see the man as a master of his medium , and The Weeping Meadow is as good as any of his other films ? every one I've seen so far is a masterpiece or close to it . This film has a lot in common with the director's first big success , The Traveling Players . It follows a little girl , Eleni , from 1919 to the time of the Greek Civil War , at the end of WWII . And , as the title implies , it's a great tragedy . There is a lot of weeping . It may be long and slow , but it's always gripping . Angelopoulos ' imagery is second to none in modern cinema . There are just so many jaw-dropping sequences . My favorite was the one where the camera explored its way through a maze of bed sheets drying on clotheslines , discovering various musicians hidden within . It's not a complaint , per se , but if you're going to watch the film beware of its chronological ellipses . The film can skip ahead years in just a second , when the pace usually makes each second feel like years ( in a good way ! ) . I hope New Yorker video , or some other company , digs up the Angelopoulos films that have been unavailable so far , and puts The Traveling Players on DVD , as well .
385268	391152	65724	10.0	Definitely one of the great American films .	This movie is most famous for a scene in which Jack Nicholson tells a waitress to hold the chicken salad between her knees so he can get some plain wheat toast , but , in a movie as good as this , that very famous scene may be its least memorable one . After that scene , I hadn't heard anything about what this film was really about , and its depth and power took me completely by surprise . It's a story of a man trapped in his own life , unable to find a place to settle . All the locations at which he has arrived have lead to nothing but disappointment and the realization that there just might not be a life for him . God , how I can sympathize . Just as I was starting to question whether Nicholson was as good an actor as everybody seems to think he is , I've come upon his very best performance . Karen Black plays his girlfriend , a hick who loves him to death . He's not sure if she's good enough for him , or vice versa . Lois Smith , Ralph Waite , and Susan Anspach give good supporting performances . A flat-out masterpiece .
384891	391152	24481	10.0	Hollywood Masterpiece	Man , I've never seen Greta Garbo before . She is absolutely electric in Queen Christina , giving a performance of great strength and passion . In fact , if there is a flaw in this film , it is that Garbo is TOO good . She draws your attention away from all other parts of the film , all action and all other performances , so that you can only stare at that vision of beauty and power . We don't have stars anymore . Julia Roberts ? Don't make me laugh . When she's in a movie , all I tend to do is stare at her chest . Greta Garbo exudes a sexuality which is somehow simultaneously subtle and demanding . Despite the difficulties of looking elsewhere , I did often enough to claim that this film is a masterpiece in all other aspects as well . The production design is marvelous . The cinematography ( especially when the photography is of Garbo ! ) is impeccable and gorgeous . The writing is actually wonderful , too . There are a lot of magnificent lines . Indeed , there are so many great ones that I can't at the minute pick out one in particular . Perhaps the exchange : " You can not die an old maid , my queen . " to which Christina replies : " I won't . I plan to die a bachelor . " SLIGHT SPOILERS : Oh yes . The lesbian erotica . I must admit , that aspect of the film was what convinced me to sit down and watch it . There isn't too much , but there are a few very hot moments where Christina is kissing her young servant girl and one great scene where a wench is hitting on her , believing her to be a man . The main romantic relationship in the film is between Christina and Antonio , an envoy from Spain . There's also a choice sequence of homoeroticism , where she , again , pretending she is a young man , ends up in the same room at an inn with him . She does finally reveal her femininity and ends up sleeping with him ( in one of those awesome Hollywood edits ) . In the morning , Antonio's servant comes to tell him that they cannot yet leave the inn . He and Christina , whom others think is a young man , are sleeping in a bed under a large canopy . When the servant tells him their dilemma , Antonio replies : " Good . " " Are you going to get up from bed now ? " " No . I think I will stay in bed all day today . " The servant has a very perplexed look on his face . " Well , do you want some hot chocolate ? " " Yes . " " Er , um , how about the , um , other gentleman ? " Antonio answers for shim : " Yes . " Now , what do you think that implies ? ? ? .
385572	391152	31855	10.0	Offensive , but it's a great cartoon	Betty ended her career in 1939 . I don't know which is her last cartoon , but I'm hoping it's this one . It would be a great culmination of the cartoon's development . Featuring some very offensive Indian stereotypes , but that doesn't mean it's not exceptional . Betty , transporting swing instruments to her band , stops at an Indian reservation to buy a tom-tom . The Indians steal her instruments and start using them in stereotypical Indian ways . A Hiawatha clone uses the cello case as a canoe , one man uses a trombone to siphon water from a pond , a woman uses drumsticks to crush corn into meal , and another man tries to cook with a bongo drum . Sally stops them and teaches them how to swing .
385503	391152	28010	10.0	We've really lost something nowadays	I don't want to be one of those " they don't make ' em like they used to " people , but I just can't help it when it comes to comedy . We've lost that talent completely , it seems . I can't think of any really great comedies of the past ten years . The golden age for film comedy was the mid 1930s to the mid 1940s ( at least for the talkies ; silent comedies were a totally different art form ) . This is also the period of the screwball comedy . My Man Godfrey was one of the first screwball comedies . Films such as Bringing Up Baby and The Lady Eve perfected the form , but My Man Godfrey is nearly as perfect . It isn't quite as funny as Bringing Up Baby nor is it as emotionally resonant as The Lady Eve , but it is funny , it has depression era social commentary ( its main theme is identical to Preston Sturges ' Sullivan's Travels , beating it by 6 years ) , and the script is marvelous . The finale is as good as any other comic finale , including the last scene of Some Like it Hot . The actors are also in top form . William Powell is the straight man , and he plays it very well . All the rest are as nutty as ever . Carole Lombard probably gives her greatest performance here ( I suppose I shouldn't say that since I've only seen her in one other film ; I can only guess at this since it is one of the funniest performances of film history ) . Gail Patrick is perfectly devious as Lombard's conniving sister . Eugene Pallette is great as their father . Alice Brady , though , steals the show as their mother , a total fruit cake whose protoge , Carlo ( Mischa Auer ) does nothing but eat the household's food and pound the same couple of notes on their piano . And look for cameos by MGM regulars Franklin Pangborn and Grady Sutton .
385310	391152	58430	10.0	one-of-a-kind	I'm not going to go into any long , complicated discussions on Onibaba . Suffice it to say that it is one of the most original and best films I've ever seen . It's truly breathtaking . It grows to a fever pitch of fear by the finale . The black and white photography is also amazing . .
385168	391152	37824	10.0	My God , I wasn't expecting it to be THAT good	Before I new much about him , when I used to see the box for Alexander Nevsky on the Foreign shelf at my local video store , I always misread Eisenstein's name , transforming it into Einstein . Well , Einstein suits him just as well , for what Albert Einstein was to science Sergei Eisenstein is to the cinema . Witness Battleship Potemkin , possibly the most rousing film ever made . Today , nearly 80 years after it was made , it still has the power to inspire revolution . Its amazing montage editing style may have died with silent cinema ( although there are at least two directors today who are somewhat similar : Shinya Tsukamoto and Darren Aranofsky ) , but it will never be forgotten . When Eisenstein moved to sound , he realized that rapid montage would not work in the new medium . He adapted his style , perfecting a new one . Alexander Nevsky and the two Ivan the Terrible films come off to many people as stale historical epics . To me , they come off as the very peak of that genre . Usually I do find historical epics stuffy , but the direction , acting , writing , cinematography , and music of these three films are exquisite , so far beyond anything that I've ever seen that these films stir me nearly as much as Potemkin does . Ivan the Terrible I is a bit confusing in its plot to begin with , but you have to stick with it . First off , there are many , many characters . A great many are not mentioned by name , and most of the rest are only named on rare occasions . But Eisenstein familiarizes us with the characters ' faces . These faces are perfectly chosen and lighted spectacularly . The light is so harsh that every crag in a person's face is clear , and noses cast foreboding shadows . The way time progresses in this film is without much warning , and one problem I encountered was identifying Ivan himself . I did not catch on at first when the first sequence ended and the second sequence began , and Ivan , in the second sequence , has a beard . Once you realize that , though , you're home free . That beard serves as a great identifier throughout the film ( and is used in many ways by Eisenstein ) . I was expecting to like this film , but I found myself obsessed with this utter masterpiece .
385568	391152	113824	10.0	Ghibli cannot be stopped !	A very moving animé film from Studio Ghibli , as good as anything either Miyazaki or Takahata have made . It's a very simple and down-to-earth movie about a young teenage girl who is experiencing her first love , as well as doubts about her future . Whisper understands its characters as few films do , and I became quite intimate with our heroine , Shizuku . It also has a sense of mood unmatched by any other film I can think of set in everyday life . The way it feels to live in a cramped apartment , the emotions of the first day of school , and the way the sky looks after it has rained ? so many generic memories of my life brought right to the forefront , as if they were the only moments that mattered . The film enveloped me so completely , I could smell the odor of the antique shop . The music is so wonderful , the score by Yuji Nomi . And I never could have imagined that John Denver's song ' Country Roads ' would make me weep . Well , it was in Japanese , but still . It's frightening . Each Ghibli film I see makes me think that the next one cannot possibly match it , yet each film inevitably does . .
385716	391152	311648	10.0	The best Thanksgiving movie ever	Thanksgiving has always meant a lot to me . Unlike the stereotypical depiction of the holiday from movies , I always found it to be , beyond any other day of the year , the day when my family is the closest . Differences and resentments fade for a day , possibly because we're Midwesterners of German descent and there's nothing we like more than food . Whatever the reason , it's a pleasant holiday for me . Pieces of April captures the way I feel about Thanksgiving perfectly , and it moved me as deeply as any movie I can think of . It has a few flaws , a few things that could have been changed for the better , but its overall effect made me overjoyed and emotionally crushed at the same time . Patricia Clarkson was nominated for an Oscar for her performance as a mother of three dying of breast cancer . She's not a very nice person , and she's not too pleased with the way her life has come out . Katie Holmes plays April , Clarkson's eldest daughter . She lives in a crummy apartment in NYC and has invited her family to Thanksgiving dinner , most likely to be her mother's last . Unfortunately , Holmes finds that her oven doesn't work . She desperately searches the other apartments in her building for someone who isn't using their oven . A third track follows April's black boyfriend who rides his motorized scooter around the city for reasons that are at first obscure . It's a comedy , and a very , very funny one at that , but the themes of family and past injuries are remarkably touching . Clarkson is amazing , and she is the most obviously impressive performer in the film . However , Katie Holmes really proves herself to be one of the best actresses of her generation ; her role is much more subtle and complex than Clarkson's . Oliver Platt plays April's father , and he also gives a subtle performance as the person trying to unite the family before his wife is gone . The only thing that really bothered me was the character of Wayne ( played by Sean Hayes ) , one of the apartment dwellers whom April asks for help . He agrees to help her , but he thinks that she owes him something big , i . e . , sex . That's surely believable , but the character is played as a goofy , eccentric cartoon character . It's far below the standard of the rest of the film . It reminds me a lot of Mickey Rooney's character in Breakfast at Tiffany's , an underthought splotch on what is otherwise a masterpiece . I wonder if it will have anywhere near as powerful an effect on others as it did on me ( I wept for nearly a half an hour , and occasionally sobbed for almost an hour after that ) , but I am certainly more than willing to stick up for a movie like this that I really believe in . .
384911	391152	69467	10.0	The silence of a Bergman film can tear the flesh right from your body	Ingmar Bergman makes the sorts of intellectually challenging films that are almost not allowed anymore . The younger generation is basically taught that the sorts of profound questions that Bergman asks ( and Bergman more than any other auteur , for even the most highly respected auteurs , Truffaut , Fellini , Kurosawa , Kubrick , shied away from subjects such as Bergman has tackled ) are unnecessary . They are taught this because , if they were to willingly examine the emptiness of human existence , they would quickly fail to participate in all the lovely shadows on the cave wall , and then society would go kaput . Truthfully , I have not seen all that many Ingmar Bergman films . This shocked me , too , as I realized this . Before I came to college , I rented his most famous film , The Seventh Seal . Even the uneducated realize upon seeing it that it is one of the best films ever made . Next , probably the next week after I saw The Seventh Seal , I rented his second most famous film : Wild Strawberries . At the time , I did not find it all that interesting . It has been four years since I saw it , and I know I should rent it again , but I remember that I was sure that I understood it when it was over , and that its profundity was slight in comparison with The Seventh Seal . Like I said , I need to see it again . It was some three years later that I saw another Bergman film , Through the Glass Darkly . I was stunned at it , as I was at The Seventh Seal , even if slightly less . And then I saw maybe the greatest film that I ever saw , and it was one of his : Persona , the film that has haunted me for months now . And now comes my fifth Bergman experience : Cries and Whispers . At first , I found it sort of slow , but that did not last for long . Without even realizing it , at about the half-hour point , I was so drawn in that I was experiencing the same pain as was being experienced by the four main characters onscreen . This is a devastating film . Its silence hurts terribly . And sometimes subtle sound effects scrape across your skin like a fork : the clock especially . Also , the whispers , which turn up as the film has faded out and is fading back in . I know for a fact that Criterion is doing a DVD version of this film , and that is great . On a VHS tape , the static is so loud as to drown out the subtleties on the soundtrack . And then there are the cries , which made me want to cry aloud along with the characters . All in all , my understanding of this completely exhilarating and painful film are weak . But in this lies the greatness of such a film that challenges my intellect . I must think hard about this , reading up on it , and hopefully seeing it again . I do not at all mind having to do this . It is much better than the escapism of an everyday film . And if you are reading this comment because you love this movie , may I suggest Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters , which was obviously inspired by this film . It is not as great , for it is lighter , but it is a worthwhile followup to the film . Also , William Faulkner's novel As I Lay Dying , which has a somewhat similar plot . It is about a family's relationship as concerns their dead mother .
385442	391152	60107	10.0	If this is not a perfect film , then such a thing doesn't exist	Howard Hawks defined a masterpiece as a film with three great scenes and no bad ones . What would Hawks have said about Andre Rublev , a film with no bad scenes and some fifty scenes that are not just great but perfect in every aspect ? This is one of the most difficult films ever made , so don't expect a cake walk going into it . Truth be told , I shut it off after the first tape of two on my first attempt . I tried it again later the same week , and found it to be one of the best film ever made , maybe even the best ( although I'd have to see it once more to confirm that ) . When the screen went black , I was ready to pass out . It was a complete religious experience , one that can bring you closer to God than any church or even Bible ever could .
