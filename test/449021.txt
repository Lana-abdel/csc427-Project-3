383091	449021	372873	1.0	Resurrect dragons revive a Korean legend .	Convoluted , confusing and hard as hell to follow . Albeit , some real good special effects . This movie is about resurrect dragons from a Korean legend smashing and bashing around California . Two creatures of legend , a Good Imoogi and a Dark Imoogi , both want to become heavenly dragons . Director Hyung-rae Shim has these giant creatures morphing from serpents to dragons and back again with massive armies of very formidable monstrosities . A young woman turning twenty years old , bearing a red dragon tattoo on her shoulder is the key to consummating a legend spawned a half-millennium ago . I can't believe I wasted my time watching this mess and still have no idea what I watched . At least it was cool watching the dragons and their minions battle . Starring are : Jason Behr , Amanda Brooks , Robert Forster , Craig Robinson and Aimee Garcia .
383715	449021	122603	2.0	Marabunta ! Killer ants !	Side stepping an ant hill is always wise . While you're at it , side step this TV offering . So predictable . So boring . A dormant volcano stirs ravenous soldier ants to attack a small Alaska town . Also known as MARABUNTA . No matter the title , they both equal lame . Julia Campbell is a small source of interest , but she can't carry a movie . Also taking part are Mitch Pileggi , Eric Lutes , Bill Osborn and Patrick Fugit . Even the killer ants can't save this one .
383128	449021	47244	2.0	Not even a B movie .	Lame may be the best word to describe this attempt at horror . Primitive special effects . An attractive young woman ( Anne Kimbell ) is vacationing in Mexico and hears tales of missing persons and pets . She herself witnesses a giant octopus and a huge one-eyed amoeba like creature that may be the answer to the disappearances . Authorities won't believe her story ; not even deep-sea diving oceanographer ( Stuart Wade ) . Love interest convinces a soft investigation . Acting is atrocious . This is the debut of Roger Corman as a producer . He also has a bit part . Director Wyott Ordung too plays a role . Other players : Dick Pinner , Inez Palange and David Garcia .
383627	449021	74434	2.0	Scraping the bottom .	A very weak and way below any kind of budget . Drive-in movie fare . While drive-in moviegoers are hugging , smooching and backseat bouncing , a lunatic is randomly picking victims to slash , dismember and kill . The drive-in is built on the former grounds of a circus and is being managed by former circus knife handler ( Newton Naushaus ) and his grounds keeper is the former sword swollower ( Douglas Gudbye ) . Two dim-witted detectives ( Jake Barnes and Adam Lawrence ) are assigned to investigate and realize the weapon of choice seems to be an antique sword . Hard to find anything redeemable . Nothing frightening or scary . Some of the situations end up being comical . Also listed as players : Verkina Flowers , Marty Gatsby , Patrica James and Norman Sherlock .
381999	449021	272425	2.0	The Earth is under attack .	Very interesting product from South Korea , a . k . a . REPTILIAN is equally good as it is bad . Far out story line with unimaginative dialogue . Very good F / X holds your interest . Hostile invading aliens reanimate a dormant giant lizard-like creature named Yonggary to eradicate humanity and take control of Earth . Super cool alien spacecraft and a prehistoric monster should be more than enough to keep Sci-Fi fans happy . Overview of notable cast members : Harrison Young , Donna Philipson , Karl Calhoun , Dan Cashman and Richard B . Livingston . The monster is handsomely detailed and fun to watch .
383366	449021	57128	2.0	It is all in the bloodline .	Roger Corman directs ; Vincent Price acts ; and the beautiful Debra Paget is on the screen for the last time . This is part of Corman / Price's Edgar Allen Poe multiple ventures . This is close to being the worst , but there is plenty of chills and suspense to keep you watching . Price plays a 17th century warlock burned at the stake and a descendent that returns to the small village homestead a hundred and ten years later . There is very little to associate with Poe , although the story line is chilling and creepy . Price and Paget are ably supported by Lon Chaney Jr , Elisha Cook and Frank Maxwell . This movie seems to have its own attitude and is a must for Price fans . Of course , Corman's followers will also have something to debate about . Was there enough money to make this better or is it beyond help ? You be the judge and jury . Enjoy !
383220	449021	369226	2.0	Fear what you don't believe in .	Some things may need to stay in the dark . Christian Slater plays a private investigator specializing in the unexplainable supernatural . Tara Reid is a museum curator ( yeah , sure ) . Slater must prove and then try to destroy creatures from a bound ancient world trying to escape the dark . This movie is so convoluted it hurts ; although what you see of the creatures is interesting . Slater must have been hard up for the money . The enticing Reid managed to read her lines , but without sincerity . This film is flat ; it wouldn't take much for the video game to be better . Also in the cast : Stephen Dorff , Matthew Walker and Frank C . Turner . A must / mess to avoid .
384376	449021	60558	2.0	The Old West mixes with horror .	The title is misleading . Technically it is Dr . Frankenstein's granddaughter ( Nadia Onyx ) that the infamous outlaw Jesse James ( John Luton ) meets . This way out and wacky western has the fast shooting outlaw traveling with a hulk of a friend Hank Tracy ( Cal Bolder ) instead of his brother Frank . The two are running from Marshal MacPhee ( Jim Davis ) and his posse . Dr . Maria Frankenstein ( Onyx ) and her brother ( Steven Geray ) have more or less ran everyone out of a small town where they decide to continue conducting experiments from the original Dr . Frankenstein's journals . After Jesse's partner is shot , the two outlaws are aided by a young Mexican woman ( Estelita Rodriguez ) who takes them to the Frankenstein descendants for medical attention . This is a weird combination of western and horror . It is quite obvious the two should not have met . No doubt this could be a hoot if you happen to be " two sheets to the wind " . Also in the cast are : Roger Creed and Rayford Barnes . Note : Lupton is probably most remembered as Indian Agent Tom Jeffords on the classic TV western series Broken Arrow in the mid / late 50s .
382098	449021	60270	2.0	A demented doctor messes with nature .	Heading a search for oil , a geologist ( John Agar ) finds adventure in the form of a mad doctor ( Jeff Alexander ) who seeks to create a reptile man . Also in the cast are Francine York , Bill Thurman and Shirley McLine . Talk about low budget . . . some kid gave up his lunch money to make this one . And when you finally get to see a " creature " , you bust a gut laughing . Why did they waste color film on this ? To be exact , being shot in black & white would've been an asset . This is a must to avoid . Sorry .
382312	449021	117692	2.0	Terrifying visitors from the past .	Jon Porter ( Michael Gross ) returns to his old hometown for his mother's funeral and is haunted by evil teenagers that were responsible for his sister's death 30 years earlier . He must get rid of the ghostly demons to protect his teenage daughter Michelle ( Hilary Swank ) . Based on the conjuring of Stephen King and directed by Adam Grossman . My favorite scene is when Jon must cut off his own thumb in ritual to bringing a halt to the haunting . F / X are better than average in this hackneyed story . I found Alexis Arquette totally annoying . Also in the cast : Jennifer Aspen , Glen Beaudin and Jennifer Elise Cox . You may find this better than expected ; although not out of the ordinary .
383678	449021	462519	3.0	The proverbial td in a punchbowl .	This comedy ( questionable ) ranks right down there with the worst pieces of crap I've ever seen . Sorry , Billy Bob , you couldn't even pull this one out . Roger ( Jon Heder ) is a dork , with high anxiety and low self-esteem , working as a New York City meter maid . He enrolls in a top-secret confidence building class taught by Dr . P . ( Billy Bob Thornton ) and soon enters a competition to woo Amanda ( Jacinda Barrett ) , who recently befriended the beleaguered Roger . The rivalry spins completely out of control and the pranks that ensue are assumed to be the comical hight-lights of the film . I thought I didn't like the movie , because I just don't like Heder . No , I just wasn't impressed much period . Also appearing are : Michael Clarke Duncan , Horatio Sanz and Matt Walsh .
383405	449021	74157	3.0	Screwing to the center of the earth .	Based on a Edgar Rice Burroughs novel , AT THE EARTH'S CORE provides little more than means to escape and give your brain a rest . A Victorian scientist Dr . Abner Perry ( Peter Cushing ) invents a giant burrowing machine , which he and his American partner ( Doug McClure ) use to corkscrew their way deep into the earth to explore what mysteries it may hold . They soon discover a lost world of subhuman creatures having conflict with prehistoric monsters . Cushing comes across as an absent minded professor to the point of being annoying . Instead of being a bold adventurer , he comes across effeminate . On the other hand McClure overacted enough to make himself also laughable . Caroline Munro plays the pretty Princess Dia that refuses to leave her world near the center of the earth . Also in the cast are : Godfrey James , Cy Grant and Michael Crane .
382313	449021	65549	3.0	He feels that he is a woman .	Such a serious subject to turn out so campy and ludicrous . George Jorgenson Jr ( John Hansen ) realizes at an early age that he is a female trapped in a male's body . This tends to be a bizarre biography of the famed 50s phenomenon first sex change . . . George becomes Christine . Not exactly and in-depth study and it is strange that George looks more masculine as a female . Go figure . It would tend to be logical that liberties were taken with actuality just to get this oddity on the screen . It does make you want to search out the autobiographical novel by Jorgenson to get the real skinny . Trent Lehman plays George at 7 . Also in the cast are : Joan Tompkins , Pamelyn Ferdin , John Himes and Oscar Beregi Jr . as Dr . Dahlman , the sex change doctor . Curiosity is the driving force to tend with . It is a shame this comes across a laughing matter .
383175	449021	858437	3.0	The story of a gruesome serial killer .	Michael Feifer writes and directs this fictitious story based on the arrest of Edward Gein in Plainfield , Wisconsin . Gein was responsible for a rash of gruesome murders that sent a shock wave of terror through his rural hometown in the late 1950's . His evil mind and twisted world is suspected to be caused by his domineering zealous Lutheran mother . Ed was given the nickname " The Butcher of Plainfield " . He would rob corpses from fresh graves of women who resembled his mother and he would have sex with them before ' dressing them like a deer ' in his garage . Severed heads with bodies hanging upside down being his personal trademark . After his arrest there would be many articles made from human skin found in his home . In this movie , a young deputy Bobby Mason ( Shawn Hoffman ) makes the search for Gein ( Kane Hodder ) a personal one , when his storekeeper mother ( Priscilla Barnes ) goes missing . The acting is a whole lot better than the ridiculously liberal telling of the documented events concerning Gein . Also in the cast : Adrienne Frantz , Timothy Oman , John Burke , Michael Berryman and Amy Lyndon .
384344	449021	56875	3.0	Grissly horror filmed in Blood Color .	Soooo bad ; but fun to watch . Herschell Gordon Lewis is a one man gore master . He directs , produces , creates a story line and takes charge of cinematography and special effects . He also provides the original music . A weird and deranged Egyptian caterer ( Mal Arnold ) searches for beautiful young women to mutilate and dismember in sacrifice for an Egyptian goddess . A puzzled detective ( William Kermin ) works hard to find the mysterious killer and provide safety and peace of mind for his young girlfriend ( Connie Mason ) . Some pretty gory scenes that thrilled drive-in goers in the mid 1960s . Other credited players : Scott H . Hall , Ashlyn Martin , Astrid Olson and Louise Kamp . Lewis himself is the voice of the radio announcer .
384001	449021	435665	3.0	Campus of the dead .	So lame it isn't even funny . A zombie infection overtakes a small college campus and a government squad of secret operatives back up a couple of scientists sent to find the origin of the outbreak . Collecting zombie DNA damn sure is not easy . Once bitten you're one of " them " . The entire university has been completely infected by the run amok undead . This sequel does not even redeem the awful original HOUSE OF THE DEAD ( 2003 ) . Senseless entertainment is accomplished though . A few glimpses of female nakedness added to a gaggle of gore and exploding heads should keep any zombie freak happy . Credited cast members : Emmanuelle Vaugier , Victoria Pratt , Ed Quinn , Sid Haig and Nadine Velazquez . The " F " word holds together an unimaginative script .
382376	449021	95989	3.0	Better tomatoes for a new invasion .	A slightly larger budget allows for tomatoes to be turned into people . Professor Gangreen ( John Astin ) has finally developed the formula to make the once feared red vegetable to look human . And once again it is San Diego that will see the beginnings of a second invasion . A young pizza maker falls in love with a gorgeous girl working with Gangreen . Is she really a tomato ? Music will serve as a catalyst instead of a destroyer with this newer developed tomato . Citizens are reluctant to believe the ancient attack of the tomatoes will be repeated . This sequel is really easier to watch than the original ; thanks to a young George Clooney and a beautiful Karen Misal . Also in the cast : Steve Lundquist , Teri Weigel , Anthony Starke , Rock Peace and Charlie Jones .
382676	449021	92115	3.0	Little creatures want their world back .	Once upon a time the world was divided by humans and trolls . This bizarre fantasy faire has an evil troll , Torok ( Phil Fondacaro ) , selecting a San Francisco apartment house to become the center of a new troll order . Two youngsters , Harry ( Noah Hathaway ) and Wendy ( Jenny Beck ) Potter , are used as pawns by Torok to try and change residents , apartment by apartment , into mysterious trolls and demons . Most of the creatures seem claymation-like . And the troll king resembles the lead creature in LEPRECHAUN ( 1993 ) . You may ask yourself why you watched from beginning to end . This one gets old quick and the PG-13 rating must be strictly enticement . Most , if not all , violence seems to be implied . A pretty good list of stars partake : Michael Moriarty , Shelley Hack , June Lockhart , Gary Sandy , Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Sonny Bono .
382855	449021	113858	3.0	Another giant insect to chill and drill you .	This movie borders being terrible . It is so close to being lame it is funny . Slimy , gory , and crude . Dialogue is about as bad as the acting . A spacecraft crashes in a swamp in a National Park and the area is invaded by mosquitoes as big as a Great Dane . Special effects vary in degrees of believability . But then again we are talking giant mosquitoes . View it as a bloody comedy and you won't be too disappointed . Two of the writers ( Gunnar Hansen and Steve Hodge ) are cast members . Also taking credit as actors are : Ron Asheton , Steve Dixon , Rachel Loiselle and John Reneaud . Very small children might actually be frightened , so don't spoil it for them by laughing out loud .
383908	449021	280707	3.0	Col . Mustard with the candlestick in the library .	Is this Robert Altman at his best or worst ? GOSFORD PARK is a slow moving all-star murder mystery . A beastly owner of a 1930's British estate is killed during a weekend shooting party and upper crust get together . The movie is very wordy and mostly with bad accents . The murder event is not as important as the attitudes and suspicions between the high class guests and their servants . The cast members dialogue make the movie . You either find this entertaining or pretty lame . Wardrobes and sets are outstanding . Notable among this large cast are : Kristin Scott Thomas , Eileen Atkins , Michael Gambon , Jeremy Northam , Kelly Macdonald , Maggie Smith , Emily Watson and Ryan Phillippe . A hot buttered rum sounds good about now . Brandy if its handy .
384253	449021	465538	3.0	The truth can be adjusted .	Billed as a different style of thriller . I must have been brain dead through this one . I just thought this film dragged on and on and on . I was wanting to be thrilled and maybe excited . . . neither happened for me . Sorry George , sometimes a movie just goes flat . George Clooney stars as a mega attorney known as the " Fixer " . He works for one of the nation's most powerful law firms . Anytime one of their clients has a problem , preferably big , Clayton is called on to put a spin on the circumstances and get trouble solved with little or no publicity . One of the firm's premiere attorneys ( Tom Wilkinson ) goes a little nuts and strips in the middle of a deposition . Clayton is sent to find out what caused such a display . He decides it was just a matter of the attorney getting off of his medications . Things seem to spiral out of control and so does the interest in this movie . Its like the characters going through the motions and actually getting nothing done . Also in the film are : Tilda Swinton , Sydney Pollack and Michael O'Keefe .
383323	449021	257106	3.0	Beware : SCARY MOVIE returns .	This SCARY MOVIE sequel is a take or leave it offering . No horror and not too much more to laugh at . Outrageous , yes . The strong sexual humor and graphic language brings a questionable amount of viewers back for more . Spoofing movies like STIGMATA and THE EXORCIST , a conniving college professor ( Tim Curry ) , lures special students to a haunted house for various decadent reasons . . . mainly to get laid . My favorite scene is the sequence of Tori Spelling with the " ghostly " lover . This comedy is directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans . The cast with various degrees of stardom features : Marlon and Shawn Wayans , Anna Faris , Regina Hall , James Woods , Chris Elliott , Kathleen Robertson and Veronica Cartwright . Woods is a hoot . I was most impressed with Robertson . . . damn , that girl is nice . No doubt about having a following ; enough to continue on .
383172	449021	79027	3.0	Sci-Fi drama . Unfullfilling .	Disjointed . Suspense that proves to be wasted . Maybe with a bigger budget . . . but then again probably not . The citizens of Santa Monica , California are fearful of the dark of night . A series of decapitation murders has Detective Dave Mooney ( Richard Jaeckel ) baffled and under watchful eyes . Roy Warner ( William Devane ) , a writer of bloody crime novels , is the father of one of the first victims . He also has history with Mooney ; it was the detective that sent him to prison . Warner wants answers ; so does TV reporter Zoe Owens ( Cathy Lee Crosby ) . A police pathologist ( Casey Kasem ) finds " The Mangler " to be gray and of supernatural origin . The finale is weak and leaves you wondering why you sat that long for almost nothing . Also in the cast : Keenan Wynn , Jacquelyn Hyde and John Bloom .
382509	449021	389790	3.0	Animated with not enough fun .	If you like Jerry Seinfeld you'll like BEE MOVIE ; if you don't . . . you won't . I'm in the latter camp , but watched to see what the hype was about . Barry B . Benson ( Seinfeld ) is a new graduate and must decide his future . Instead of being a worker bee with the same job everyday forever is not that appealing . He would rather be a pollen jock and go out into the world and collect nectar , but he knows that job is but a lofty dream for a young bee . Barry soars out into the world on his own and breaks one of the most important rules of beedom . . . he speaks to a human . He is saved from a bad situation by Vanessa Bloome ( Renee Zellweger ) a florist ; and through that relationship Barry decides to sue the human race for manufacturing honey . Some pretty big named stars lend their voices : Chris Rock , Matthew Broderick , John Goodman , Kathy Bates , Rip Torn and Michael Richards .
382344	449021	65112	4.0	Inside the cold-war .	I'm sorry that I missed the thrills that others have proclaimed about this movie . I found it interesting ; but easy to confuse the whole agenda ; lacking action and a half an hour too long . Just my opinion . A highly ranked Soviet official , who claims knowledge of Russian missiles in Cuba , defects to shelter in America . And a French agent with Cuban connections is asked to help the U . S . expose a spy ring . The acting is calm and wooden . Passion is obviously missing in this tense drama . The cast includes Frederick Stafford , John Forsythe , Karin Dor and Dany Robin . Directed by Alfred Hitchcock , this by no means compares with his better known movies .
382772	449021	35096	4.0	Mummy on the move .	A resurrected wrapped monster goes on a murdering binge . A lunatic is seeking revenge against living members of a previous expedition . Universal seems to be running out of wrapping as well as new ideas . Most of the budget was probably spent on Lon Chaney Jr . to star as Kharis , the Mummy . Other players are George Zucco , Wallace Ford , Turhan Bey , Dick Foran and Elyse Knox . How much longer can this madness continue ?
383955	449021	268582	4.0	Country music showcase .	For fans of " old " country and western music this will assimilate a long journey to Mecca . An assembly line of the then-current and up and coming stars of the genre . A bumbling agent , Colonel Beeddebaum ( Doodles Weaver ) goes to Nashville to sign up acts for a movie about country and western music . The cast features a who's who list of named performers from the 50's and 60's like : Marty Robbins , Connie Smith , Webb Pierce , Waylon Jennings , Bill Anderson , Johnny Cash , Kitty Wells , Porter Waggoner , Dottie West , Lefty Frizzell , The Stoneman Family , The Osborne Brothers and Hank Snow . Just a few of the musical highlights : " Count Me Out " by Marty Robbins , " Nobody But a Fool " by Connie Smith , " Po Folks " by Bill Anderson , " I've Been Everywhere " by Hank Snow , " I'll Be Alright Tomorrow " by The Osborne Brothers , " You Ain't No Better Than Me " by Webb Pierce , " Skid Row Joe " by Porter Waggoner , " For Just a Moment " by Margie Singleton and " Dreams " by Faron Young . Also appearing is Ralph Emery .
383157	449021	39198	4.0	Survival in the wilderness .	Low budget jungle adventure . A brief 62 minute escape and quite predictable . Leif Erickson and his transport co-pilot buddy Frank Jenks crash land in the jungle in hopes of surveying a diamond mine . While working for the mine owner Douglass Dumbrille , the two fliers encounter a savage jungle tribe . To their astonishment a blonde white woman ( Gale Sherwood ) rules as a goddess being raised since infancy by the tribe . It turns out that the " blonde savage " is the daughter of the mine owner's murdered partner . So it is destination stateside to see if justice prevails ; or will someone get away with murder . Other players : John Dehner , James Logan , Ernest Whitman and the alluring Veda Ann Borg .
382807	449021	47898	4.0	Mad scientist misuses the Atom .	Just possibly the best from Ed Wood Jr . Wood directs and co-writes with Alex Gordon ; BRIDE OF THE MONSTER is really fun to watch and is the last starring role for horror icon Bela Lugosi . Dr . Eric Varnoff ( Lugosi ) is a Russian scientist , who has the help of his man-beast servant Lobo ( Tor Johnson ) , experimenting with radiation in attempts to create atomic " supermen " . When the dose of flesh-burning radiation fails the victim is fed to Varnoff's octopus . Loretta King plays an over-eager newspaper reporter searching for the source of a string of killings . And Tony McCoy is the detective trying to find the missing reporter . Put no restraints on your imagination and be forgiving of the over acting . Others in the cast : Paul Marco , Harvey B . Dunn , Don Nagel and Delores Fuller , who would later write songs for Elvis Presley movies .
383854	449021	338290	4.0	What we do for love .	Total curiosity will have you watching . After 25 years of marriage a rural Illinois man ( Tom Wilkinson ) shocks his family , friends and coworkers by announcing he wants a sex change . His loving wife ( Jessica Lange ) with mixed emotions accepts his decision and allows him to remain living with her . Also in the cast are : Clancy Brown and Randall Arney . Definitely a conversation starter .
384361	449021	202105	4.0	Elvis documentary that makes you end up asking . . . why ?	This 1994 documentary is one of those jump on the bandwagon projects . Dealing with why Elvis Presley became one the biggest musical icons in the world . Not only a legacy of music , but his movies and then there are the multitudes of books written about him . Why ? What was it that made people of all races , creeds and nationalities strike a bond or even worship this beloved entertainer ? The Elvis phenomenon still vibrates even after death . His records have sold more now than when he was alive . The looks , style , charisma and talent combined like no other . Supposedly some painstaking interviews were involved with the research for this documentary ; but those that you see from anyone of any real importance in Elvis ' life are few . My question why . Why is it projects like this one starts out fairly interesting and then invariably out come the lunatic fringe that takes all the importance away from anything and everything Elvis accomplished and make him and themselves look like idiots ? Why ?
383658	449021	404032	4.0	Religious procedure goes wrong .	Based on a true story . Not very scary , but haunting . An average young college student Emily Rose ( Jennifer Carpenter ) begins seeing strange visions , speaking in unrecognizable tongues , succumbing to horrid body contortions and mutilations of her body . She was thought to be a victim of epilepsy or psychosis . Her priest , Father Moore ( Tom Wilkinson ) believes she is a subject of demon possession . Father Moore is requested by the family to perform an exorcism to rid Emily of her torment . Emily does not survive and the priest is charged with negligent homicide . An ambitious , admitted agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner ( Laura Linney ) takes on Father Moore's defense . The finale contains an unexpected twist . It was nice to not see it coming . Cast also includes : Campbell Scott , Colm Feore and Ken Welsh .
382536	449021	430239	4.0	Hunger for human carnage .	A young forest ranger Danielle ( Cerina Vincent ) uses her lonely outpost to grieve the death of her best friend . In a cave in the forest , a Native American legend comes to life from years of slumber . The creature has already slaughtered campers and hikers and attacks the ranger outpost . The creature slowly stalks and makes her life more miserable . Danielle's boyfriend Justin ( Dominic Zamprogna ) tries to help to no avail . She must face the wrath of the ruthless monster and destroy the flesh-ripping creature from hell . . . alone . This horror flick is better than expected and is given some credibility by being produced by Stephen J . Cannell . Also in the cast : Greg Kean , Miranda Frigon and Eric Schweig .
383005	449021	59821	4.0	Memories are not always stone cold .	Director Roger Corman again adapts Edgar A . Poe in a slow moving and often confusing tale of terror . Set in a wonderful old ruin like homestead ; mysterious black cat ; moody thunderstorms and eerie music are positive elements of this nerve wrecker . Vincent Price is masterful as a nobleman under the spell of his dead wife . When he takes a new bride back to the manor , the spirit of the first wife is to be reckoned with . A poetic finale is probably the highlight of this full color horror drama that would be just as much fun to watch in black and white . Also featured in the cast are : Elizabeth Shepherd , Derek Francis and John Westbrook . Just creepy enough to be memorable .
382720	449021	139414	4.0	Not entirely flaccid . Gore with humor .	Not to take seriously . Sit back and have fun . A thirty foot alligator is raising havoc in a lake in Maine . Bill Pullman is a park ranger and Bridget Fonda is a museum curator , who try to help the local sheriff contain or kill the gator . Seeing a man bit in half is nothing compared to seeing a grizzly bear and a cow consumed by the toothy menace . Pullman plays his part by the numbers . Fonda plays a very irritating character . Betty White is funny and comes up with a few foul mouthed comments that lightens the movie . The best acting and best lines went to Oliver Platt , playing Hector , who is a rich snob that goes around the world just to swim with alligators . Adam Arkin also has a very small role . The few special effects were too few to make a real scary show . Stay calm and laugh at will .
382650	449021	295254	5.0	Do you like to watch ? Death via computer !	This piece of gore is better than the bad rap it has been given . Some scenes could be deemed repulsive . Not advised for weak stomachs . A NYPD detective ( Stephen Dorff ) gets the case of his life when mysterious deaths are linked to a website where a demented doctor ( Stephen Rea ) tortures victims to death . Forty-eight hours after logging on to the live website the viewer dies by their own worse fear . Curiosity overrides common sense . Fear can be compelling . Also in the cast are : Natacha McElhone , Amelia Curtis and Gesine Cukrowski . www . Fear . com
382170	449021	455362	5.0	Cujo has nothing on this breed .	Wes Craven presents a thriller that satisfies .

382779	449021	252503	5.0	Talk about bait and trade . . . where is the booty of this heist ?	David Mamet writes and directs this helter skelter caper about a veteran thief ( Gene Hackman ) who is being pressured into pulling off one more big heist by a greedy , ruthless gangster ( Danny DeVito ) . Hackman does what Hackman does . . . and superbly . DeVito's character is one slimy S . O . B . and Danny seems to have fun with it . Also in the cast are Delroy Lindo , Rebecca Pidgeon and Sam Rockwell . This zigzagging story is well worth your efforts .
382611	449021	338188	5.0	A family divided comes together in need .	Director Ron Howard strikes gold again with an intense western drama based on a novel by Thomas Eidson . The screenplay is the work of Ken Kaufman and New Mexico provides some very awesome scenery . The story is set in the 1880's when after a long disappearance a father ( Tommy Lee Jones ) finds the family he left behind . His daughter ( Cate Blanchett ) is not so pleased with her father's return and intends to allow him to stay long enough to receive some medical attention and then move on . When one of her two daughters is kidnapped for Mexican slave / sex trade , she agrees to accept her father and his Native American ways to find the girl .

382364	449021	22357	5.0	How much can crime buy ?	This is a great gangster movie with a very talented cast . Wallace Beery plays a Capone-type hoodlum that allows nothing to stand in his way . Well , tax problems do put his power and glory on the skids . The veteran actor Lewis Stone is a ' high brow ' crime lord . Usual good guy Ralph Bellamy is a bootlegger / night club owner . The Chicago night life and gangland activity keeps this flick rocking back and forth , but well worth watching . Talk about a great supporting cast . Get a load of this : Johnny Mack Brown , Clark Gable and the enchanting Jean Harlow . Fun to watch on the same evening with SCAREFACE ( 32 ) and THE STAR WITNESS ( 31 )
382675	449021	257516	5.0	Avoid the bite that binds .	Thank you , Wes Craven . Right when we needed another werewolf flick . It is obvious that Craven loves having fun making a movie . Too be exact , there are more smiles than signs of fright on the character's faces . Ellie ( Christina Ricci ) and her nerdy brother Jimmy ( Jesse Eisenberg ) are on their way home one night when something comes out of nowhere and smashes their windshield causing their car to collide with another , driven by Becky ( Shannon Elizabeth ) . While checking on Becky's condition all three are attacked by a . . . you guessed it . There are some pretty grizzly scenes ; fangs , claws and werewolf transformations . The use of CGI is not real smooth ; but then the script isn't either . The eye appealing Ricci goes through the motions like a champ ; after all she is working with nerds , bullies , a dog named Zipper and a werewolf ( Derek Mears ) . Also starring are : Joshua Jackson , Milo Ventimiglia , Kristina Anapau and a cameo by Scott Baio . . . let's not forget Solar the dog . Talk about a catchy intro , the use of Bowling for Soup's cover version of Sam the Sham's oldie " Little Red Riding Hood " is fantastic .
381964	449021	257076	5.0	When the going gets tough ; the rough get rougher .	Raucous , explosive , predictable and close to being forgettable . The top LAPD brass wants to repair and polish a tarnished reputation by bringing back from retirement Sgt . " Hondo " Harrelson ( Samuel L . Jackson ) to hand pick a special S . W . A . T . team to take care of extremely dangerous situations . The last picked , but most impressive officer is Jim Street ( Colin Farrell ) whose swagger has put him in hot water with the powers that be . Also on the squad is Chris Sanchez ( Michelle Rodriguez ) who has already been turned down for S . W . A . T . duty just because she is female . She is one tough babe that can more than carry her share of the load . The team gets assigned to transfer the head of a notorious European crime cartel Alex Montel ( Oliver Martinez ) to a Federal lockup . He has just murdered his uncle , but is arrested for a missing tail light on his uncle's car . Hell breaks loose when Montel looks into a news camera and claims to give $100 million to anyone who can set him free . A routine transfer turns into an all out war fighting off several different factions greedy for the crime boss ' money . The twisting climax proves there can be a scumbag among collective honor . The special effects are entertaining and far better than the some times stupid dialogue . Farrell and Jackson more or less carry the movie ; not to over look the winsome Rodriguez . Also in the cast are : Jeremy Renner , Larry Poindexter , Josh Charles and rapper LL Cool J . Watch for Steve Forrest who played " Hondo " Harrelson in the mid 70s TV series . He has a small role as a S . W . A . T . truck driver . I seriously doubt this movie causing any change in anyone's view of the LAPD .

Easier said than done . . . each man in turn will fail in their dastardly attempts of homicide . The gang of crooks feature : Peter Sellers , Cecil Parker , Herbert Lom and Danny Green . My favorite scene is when Harry ( Sellers ) tries to capture Mrs . Wilberforce's bird that has flown the coop . Beware : spurts of bumbling action soon becomes short of irritating .

Kendrick also directs and shares writing credit with his brother Stephen . Also starring are : Jason McLeod , James Blackwell , Bailey Cave , Jim McBride and Ray Wood . Game sequences are not all that impressive . Before the credits roll there is that unmistakable warm and fuzzy feeling .
384312	449021	101345	6.0	Why isn't paradise like paradise ?

Bochner is convicted of murder and the last half of the movie Richard Crenna as Vincent Bugliosi is defending Ward in court . Bochner plays this part so well it is easy to dislike him . Ward's acting is so-so , but it doesn't matter that much with her many scenes of alluring attire or lack of . Crenna is flawless . The talent of the lovely Hall is practically wasted . Even as the final credits roll you still have questions to be answered . Best watched on a lazy day , because this movie seems to be in no hurry .
382552	449021	294918	6.0	Convicted and more than willing to die .	This depressing , but interesting drama depicts dysfunction as well as perseverance . Gary Gilmore ( Elias Koteas ) was convicted of a double murder and set to be executed by the state of Utah in 1977 . This would be of interest from coast to coast for being the first execution in America in ten years after a declared nix on capital punishment . This movie is based on Gary's estranged brother Mikal's ( Giovanni Ribisi ) book . Mikal would have several meetings with Gary during his final days with the attempt of a stay of execution . The two along with brother Frank , Jr . ( Lee Tergesen ) reminisce about the family's dysfunction , tragedy and the Mormon belief with its customs and circumstances .

This HBO Original has a soundtrack featuring : Fats Domino , Johnny Cash , Bruce Springsteen and Elvis Presley .
382793	449021	26605	6.0	Spectacular gladiator movie .	RKO Radio epic in grand style . Title is taken from a Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton novel , the movie does not employ its plot , story line or characters . Even an opening disclaimer denies any historical content besides using the eruption of Mount Vesuvious in 79 AD . as climatic backdrop . Marcus ( Preston Foster ) , an Ancient Roman blacksmith is forced to become a gladiator after his wife and son are accidentally killed . He takes a young boy Flavius ( David Holt ) under his wing and raises him as his own . Basil Rathbone is superb as Potius Pilate , who is preoccupied with the execution of Jesus Christ .

Other players : John Wood , Alan Hale , Louis Calhern , Edward Van Sloan and Zeffie Tilbury .
384390	449021	56585	6.0	Things aren't the same on the ranch .	Elvis Presley plays a singing rodeo cowboy waiting for the rodeo season to open and takes a job at a dude ranch / health spa for models and well-to-do women . The adorable Jocelyn Lane plays the cowboy / handyman's love interest . The ranch manager ( Julie Adams ) also has eyes for the singing distraction . Hidden treasure in a ghost town causes mild suspense and some slapstick comedy . In order to save money for the production company no new songs were recorded for the movie . Some tunes are almost five years old . The better ditties include : " Night Rider " , " Dirty , Dirty Feeling " , " Slowly But Surely " and " Easy Question " . Some of the background sets are super cheap ; the plot kind of flimsy ; but the magic between Presley and Lane sizzles and smolders . I think that and the music are worth the price of admission . Also in the cast are : Jack Mullaney , Edward Faulkner and Barbara Werle .
383111	449021	66518	6.0	Lusty vampire mesmerizes .	Not exactly a Hammer Films classic , but really worthy of watching .

Roy , being the ' Singing Cowboy ' , of course sings ; as well as Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers . There is limited comic relief from Constable Bullfincher ( Andy Devine ) . Also in the cast : Jane Frazee , Estelita Rodriguez and Fred Graham . This is one of my favorite Roy Rogers flicks . I can't really pinpoint why . . . just the atmosphere I guess .

The web-slinging Spider-Man has recently been bashed in the press ; but NYC needs their hero for the city is threatened by Dr . Octo Octavius ( Alfred Monlina ) who has turned himself into Doc Ock , a multiple metal armed villain . CGI perfection . Danny Elfman's score meets his genius standards . The story is actually good for an action flick . I could do without the " Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head " sequence , but I realize it is needed to show how the weight of the world has been lifted from Parker as he temporarily tries to disown his work as Spider-Man . The pizza delivery is pretty cool ; and the train fight is pulse pounding . Of course , the close-ups of Dunst also do something for me . Also in the cast are : J . K . Simmons , Daniel Gillies and the hot Venessa Ferlito . And for continuity there are the cameos of Willem Dafoe and Cliff Robertson .

383275	449021	209163	7.0	Merry old England has a mummy amuck .	This time out I am less critical , because this runs circles around the first entry in ' 99 . Brendan Fraser is much easier to take as the ultimate reluctant hero . Of course he is very " whipped " and who wouldn't be partnered with Rachel Weisz ? She impresses me more than ever . What a stunning looker and a very athletic actress . The couple's son played by Freddie Boath can at times be a pain in the butt . The story line plays a back row seat to the special effects and almost non-stop action . Rick and ' Evie ' O'Connell not only have to control the awakened mummy of High Priest Imhotep ( Arnold Vosloo ) ; they also have to fend off the likes of ' sand soldiers ' , pygmies , scorpions and the Scorpion King himself played by professional wrestler Dwayne ( The Rock ) Johnson . Also appearing in this fun time summer thriller are Oded Fehr , John Hannah and Shaun Parkes . Worthwhile fantasy flick . Can you dig it ?

383183	449021	114099	7.0	Strange and dark , erotic drama .	Writer / director Philip Ridley presents a suspenseful and equally strange story that holds your interest from the beginning . Brendan Fraser fans will see a piece of his best work . Ashley Judd fans will be very satisfied with all they get to see . This is an odd and sometimes slow story that really sizzles and catches fire . Fraser plays Darkly Noon , who finds himself separated from a strong religious family and is wandering in the woods . He is befriended by Judd , who plays the part of Callie , a very seductive soul who lives in the woods with her mute boyfriend . Fraser's character soon begins lusting for Judd ( and who wouldn't ? ) and has to battle with his religious upbringing and his impure thoughts . His self contained emotions makes him a very volatile person , as he feels God wants him to eradicate the new found evil . Figure into the mix ; the mute's deranged mother ; an evangelic undertaker ; and a wandering circus family . This is a very entertaining movie to say the least . And Miss Judd mesmerizes .

384050	449021	35957	7.0	Inspiring action in the South Pacific .	Based on the book by Richard Tregaskis , GUADALCANAL DIARY is directed expertly by Lewis Seiler . A realistic story of U . S . Marines preparing and landing on the small island in the South Pacific ; not only is there the danger of the entrenched Japanese forces , this devoted platoon battles treacherous terrain , disease and torrential weather . There is also the inner loneliness in spite of faithful camaraderie . An action-packed story told through the eyes of a war correspondent ( Reed Hadley ) . You can always count on the Marines . One of my favorite sequences is as the movie ends with the war tested leaving the island and passing the new green soldiers having no idea what they are in for . An all star cast makes for one of the best war movies of its era . Starring : Lloyd Nolan , William Bendix , Preston Foster , Roy Roberts , Anthony Quinn , Richard Jaeckel and Richard Conte .
382868	449021	40242	7.0	They say that war is Hell .	Based on a William Haine's Broadway play , COMMAND DECISION is more drama and dialog than war action .

A testosterone heavy cast including : Van Johnson , Charles Bickford , John McIntire , John Hodiak , Marshall Thompson , Ray Collins , Cameron Mitchell and Edward Arnold . It would stand to reason this film was to boost sales of War Bonds .

Terry Gilliam directs this quirky , busy heartfelt tale of a homeless former professor ( Robin Williams ) obsessed with medieval history and his relationship with a jaded guilt-ridden ex-radio DJ ( Jeff Bridges ) . Williams and Bridges are superb . The story line evolves around redemption and the search for The Holy Grail . Also in the cast are Mecedes Ruehl and David Hyde Pierce . It may take a second viewing to grasp the intended effect . This just may be Bridges ' best performance to date .
383148	449021	469641	7.0	A celebration the human spirit , perseverance and valor .	Director Oliver Stone is known for great detail and not pulling punches .

382889	449021	478216	7.0	Decent horror flick with modest body count .	Part of the After Dark Horrorfest and possibly the best of this crop . Written and directed by Rolfe Kanefsky ; a very anxious movie with some thrills and chills . Most of the acting is bad ; but some nice looking girls to stare at . The killing scenes are imaginative , violent and worth talking about . Ellen ( Blythe Metz ) orders an African fertility mask ; but is mistakenly sent one that is very demonic looking and horned . The mask possesses a evil spirit that overtakes Ellen , driving her insane . On the way to a mental hospital , her husband ( Luciano Szafir ) runs out of gas and leaves her in the car to wait .

Against the advice and wishes of his girlfriend Maya ( Leslie Bibb ) , Leon begins stalking a notorious serial killer named Mahogany ( Vinnie Jones ) , who is a legend of sorts that totally beats the living hell out of after midnight subway riders . The finale is as interesting as making a playground in the middle of a slaughter house . THE MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN is intended for mature viewers that can handle the perverse and graphic carnage . A big surprise is Shields . Not much camera time , but I'm sure the money was good . Also in the cast : Barbara Eve Harris , Roger Bart and Ted Raimi . Kudos to director Ryuhei Kitamura .

383022	449021	109450	9.0	The " Georgia Peach " was actually NO peach .	This is a damn good biopic about baseball legend Ty Cobb . Not much baseball action , but a not-to-miss movie if you are a real baseball fan . Cobb was probably the most hated ballplayer in history ; but definitely one of the best . . . and that for sure is debatable . This movie shows what happens when a biographer discovers that the truth is far less glamorous than the legend . Respected and well liked sportswriter Al Stump ( Robert Wuhl ) gets assigned and requested by the subject to write the bio of Ty Cobb ( Tommy Lee Jones ) . Stump travels through a major winter storm to Cobb's home in Tahoe . Cobb is dying and wants his story to be told . . . his way . Cobb mistreats , slanders , belittles and humiliates Stump at every opportunity . Stump has to battle not only his subject by his own values as to either candy-coat his story or present an accurate picture of the disgusting , racist , drunken and bitter Cobb . Most of Cobb's story is mythical and exaggerated . Even Ty would tell you he is a ' damn liar ' . He was definitely someone to reckon with on the ball field . With his spaced hand grip was one of the greatest hitters of his era . He was known for sliding into second or third with cleats raised to his opponent's knees . And sliding home would even raise his cleats crotch and stomach high . His nickname was " The Georgia Peach " , but he was by all means no peach . He retired in 1928 with over 90 records . In 1936 , he was the very first player to be elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame . Cobb was so disliked by other players , only 4 showed up at his funeral in 1961 . Ty Cobb was quoted " When I began playing the game , baseball was about gentlemanly as a kick in the crotch . " I've seen this movie several times and urge any sports fan to watch this story of a unique athlete .
