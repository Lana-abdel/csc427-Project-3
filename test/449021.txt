383091	449021	372873	1.0	Resurrect dragons revive a Korean legend .	Convoluted , confusing and hard as hell to follow . Albeit , some real good special effects . This movie is about resurrect dragons from a Korean legend smashing and bashing around California . Two creatures of legend , a Good Imoogi and a Dark Imoogi , both want to become heavenly dragons . Director Hyung-rae Shim has these giant creatures morphing from serpents to dragons and back again with massive armies of very formidable monstrosities . A young woman turning twenty years old , bearing a red dragon tattoo on her shoulder is the key to consummating a legend spawned a half-millennium ago . I can't believe I wasted my time watching this mess and still have no idea what I watched . At least it was cool watching the dragons and their minions battle . Starring are : Jason Behr , Amanda Brooks , Robert Forster , Craig Robinson and Aimee Garcia .
383890	449021	129332	1.0	A man has got to eat .	Captain John Boyd ( Guy Pearce ) is decorated a hero of the American-Mexican War by way of cowardice . He is promoted / demoted to a rundown California outpost . A lone man appears seeking safety and tells a gruesome story of murder and cannibalism . This dark comedy is not for everyone . Some attractive winter scenery and then there is the contrasting bloody gore and vivid violence . Outstanding performance from Robert Carlyle , the most demented cannibal in the old West . David Arquette stays wasted on ' waky weed ' . Also notable work by Jeffrey Jones as Colonel Hart . Could be a stomach turner , so consider yourself warned . ' You are what you eat ' takes on new meaning .
384165	449021	482602	1.0	Tempting . . . but stay away .	The subject matter might spark interest in some ; but this film delivers nothing you don't already know . The acting is terrible and plot just plows along into boredom . The focus is the family of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer's parent's and their struggle to comprehend their son's arrest and what turned him into the monster he became . As heartbreaking as the search was to find any reason behind Jeffrey's actions , efforts proved futile . Trying to humanize a cannibal is not an easy project . It was not accomplished here for sure . The cast includes : Scott Cordes , Cathy Barnett , Granvile O'Neal , veteran actor Bo Svenson and Rusty Sneary as Jeffrey Dahmer .
383715	449021	122603	2.0	Marabunta ! Killer ants !	Side stepping an ant hill is always wise . While you're at it , side step this TV offering . So predictable . So boring . A dormant volcano stirs ravenous soldier ants to attack a small Alaska town . Also known as MARABUNTA . No matter the title , they both equal lame . Julia Campbell is a small source of interest , but she can't carry a movie . Also taking part are Mitch Pileggi , Eric Lutes , Bill Osborn and Patrick Fugit . Even the killer ants can't save this one .
383128	449021	47244	2.0	Not even a B movie .	Lame may be the best word to describe this attempt at horror . Primitive special effects . An attractive young woman ( Anne Kimbell ) is vacationing in Mexico and hears tales of missing persons and pets . She herself witnesses a giant octopus and a huge one-eyed amoeba like creature that may be the answer to the disappearances . Authorities won't believe her story ; not even deep-sea diving oceanographer ( Stuart Wade ) . Love interest convinces a soft investigation . Acting is atrocious . This is the debut of Roger Corman as a producer . He also has a bit part . Director Wyott Ordung too plays a role . Other players : Dick Pinner , Inez Palange and David Garcia .
383627	449021	74434	2.0	Scraping the bottom .	A very weak and way below any kind of budget . Drive-in movie fare . While drive-in moviegoers are hugging , smooching and backseat bouncing , a lunatic is randomly picking victims to slash , dismember and kill . The drive-in is built on the former grounds of a circus and is being managed by former circus knife handler ( Newton Naushaus ) and his grounds keeper is the former sword swollower ( Douglas Gudbye ) . Two dim-witted detectives ( Jake Barnes and Adam Lawrence ) are assigned to investigate and realize the weapon of choice seems to be an antique sword . Hard to find anything redeemable . Nothing frightening or scary . Some of the situations end up being comical . Also listed as players : Verkina Flowers , Marty Gatsby , Patrica James and Norman Sherlock .
384440	449021	64747	2.0	Haunting tale of revenge .	From the works of Edgar Allen Poe , a tale of African tribal rites , premature burial , vengeance , grave robbing and murder . An English aristocrat ( Vincent Price ) tries to hide his disfigured brother ( Alister Williamson ) , who escapes and blackmails a doctor ( Christopher Lee ) in hiding him and allowing him to seek revenge and commit murder before being killed . Very tangled story line and not enough terror to make it to a favorites list . Horror masters Price and Lee share no scenes and neither seems to be in top form . The crimson hooded Williamson actually appears to be the lead character . Just enough female persuasion from Sally Geeson , Uta Levka and Hilary Dwyer .
381975	449021	106226	2.0	Some secrets are widely known .	Martin Scorsese directs this highly acclaimed bore fest . Elaborate costumes and sets , but a story line that offers very little . A high society lawyer ( Daniel Day-Lewis ) in mid 1800s New York City falls in love with his intended's ( Wynona Ryder ) cousin ( Michelle Pfieffer ) . A long time to wait for nothing to happen . Sorry Mr . Scorsese , just not enough to keep us awake .
384462	449021	75261	2.0	The worm turns and rises .	I thought I would be watching a pretty decent B-movie and I was quickly mistaken . Special effects are mainly close-ups of your every day earth worm . The long shots give the worms the appearance of two foot long crimson spaghetti . Just like coming upon a bad car crash . . . it is so ugly you can't turn your head . The acting . . . not good . A small community in Georgia is terrorized by giant flesh eating earth worms after being electrocuted out of the ground . Why do I think this is something that can only take place " down south " y'all ? What is intended to be horror turns out to be somewhat humorous . But still curiosity has to be fed . . . how or will the townsfolk out smart their attackers ? Actors include : Don Scardino , Patricia Pearcy and Peter MacLean . A younger viewer may be more impressed .
383637	449021	59465	2.0	An old estate hides a secret .	Eerie , bizarre and somewhat confusing . Boris Karloff is a reclusive scientist that experiments with radioactive material and gains some very strange powers . Story line is hard to follow and just does not pack a punch . The ailing Karloff does what he can , but by far no means an example of his greatness . Nick Adams , Freda Jackson , Suzan Farmer and Patrick Magee go through the motions of rounding out the cast . You deserve a pat on the back for sitting through this one .
382033	449021	61194	3.0	Fun on the ski slopes .	Most of the male population at a college with ski slopes needs the help of a surf bum to defrost the Dean's secretary . The secretary has the female students keenly aware that most boys want only one thing from them . If the secretary can be made to appear to be ' easy ' , maybe ; just maybe , the girls will follow . Music provided by The Beau Brummels , The Astronauts , Dick & DeeDee and Jay & The Americans . These musical interludes may be the only redeeming scenes in the movie . The cast includes : Gary Clarke , Chris Noel , Steve Franken and Les Brown , Jr .
382692	449021	486020	3.0	A Polish western . A bit strange .	This is said to be the first Polish western and is written and directed by Piotr Uklanski . Known in the U . S . as DEAD MAN'S BOUNTY , this film uses some strange visuals to tell a story that is short on dialog . Val Kilmer plays a corpse and some scenes are through his dead eyes . Some awkward visual situations are actually comical in a sick way . My favorite is a young man building a gallows chops off one of his own fingers and actually hangs himself testing the strength of the rope . A cowboy known only as ' the stranger ' ( Karel Roden ) finds a dead man ( Kilmer ) that he thinks is a wanted man . He takes him to the nearest town to collect the bounty . He ends up losing the corpse and the potential bounty in a gambling game with the town's drunken sheriff ( Boguslaw Linda ) and has the few townsmen turned against him when he has a dalliance with the barmaid ( Katarzyna Figura ) . He manages to escape sure death and leads the small posse on a dangerous ' wild goose chase ' . One scene has the stranger tending to a scalp wound by cauterizing with gunpowder and a match . The corpse rots chained to a hitching post as the sheriff finds out that there is no bounty to be had . This movie also known as SUMMER LOVE has a haunting theme song sung by John Davidson . Nevertheless this western is like watching a train wreck . There is just something that tells you not to look . . . but you do .
382607	449021	60536	3.0	How deep into the future will mankind go ?	Are you ready for this ? This is one of a string of little or no budget remakes by filmmaker Larry Buchanan for AIP . IN THE YEAR 2889 is a remake of Roger Corman's THE END OF THE WORLD ( 1956 ) . A stick in the mud retired Navy Captain John Ramsey ( Neil Fletcher ) and his daughter Joanna ( Charla Doherty ) survive a nuclear disaster in their built specially for the occasion home in the bottom of a canyon . With very little food to thrive on an array of uninvited guests drop in for shelter . A chain smoking young man Steve ( Paul Peterson ) and his brother Granger ( Max Anderson ) arrive first . Granger has already become a radioactive mutant . Soon arrives a stripper ( Quinn O'Hara ) and her sleazy manager Mickey ( Hugh Feagin ) . Oddly enough the next to appear is an alcoholic farmer Tim ( Bill Thurman ) . This strange collection of folks are not only in fear of radioactive fallout ; but also the raw meat eating mutants like Granger that keeps coming closer and closer to the house . Lust , drunkenness and murder are interrupted when fresh rain falls and saves Joanna from a telepathic mutant that has carried her off to the woods . Will this rainfall be mankind's salvation ? The mutant ( in an awkward rubber mask ) is played by Byron Lord .
383474	449021	39800	3.0	Let the corpse speak for herself .	This is a strange , lukewarm chiller that arguably for the first time in the movies has a corpse telling the story of her mysterious death by way of flashbacks from a lab in cold storage . This is also the only movie that Bela Lugosi played in that was released in color . The mysterious green mask that keeps appearing in the window does fit into the weird story line . Albeit this 65 minute mystery / drama is more odd than horror . Beside Lugosi , very familiar faces show up in the cast : George Zucco , Roland Varno and Nat Pendleton are aided by Molly Lamont and Gladys Blake .
383980	449021	282589	3.0	Little boy vs Santa .	This film isn't even worth the flimsiest of wrapping paper . Young Justin Carver ( Cole & Dylan Sprouse ) happens to see his beautiful mother ( Connie Sellecca ) kissing Santa Claus ; not knowing it is really his father . Justin has heard so many stories about divorce from his friends , that he fears his mother is having an affair that might lead to divorce . Justin wanting to keep his family intact . . . declares war against Santa . This movie becomes a poor man's HOME ALONE , with Justin putting jolly old St . Nick through hell and high water ; determined to keep him away from his mother . This flick is just not funny at all . To be exact , is pretty lame even for a made-for-TV project . Also in the list of players : Corbin Bersen , Sonny Carl Floyd , Jeff Olson , Eric Jacobs and Tony Larimer .
382034	449021	67148	3.0	Godzilla up against a very strange foe .	This movie is so weird , it is almost comical . Better known as Godzilla vs The Smog Monster , this flick tries to take on a different format that resembles a poor man's James Bond movie . Seems to be put together kind of haphazardly , but really pretty interesting . Godzilla battles Hedrah or Hedora , a creature spawned from industrial pollution and rank waste material . Probably the strangest in the Godzilla series .
383494	449021	315824	3.0	Who's conning who ?	George Armitage directs this version of THE BIG BOUNCE that meanders to the point of distraction . This movie seems to not have any motivation and an obvious convoluted storyline . Owen Wilson plays Jack Ryan , who if he has any luck . . . its bad luck . Wanting to stay out of jail he takes a construction job working for a shady developer Ray ( Gary Sinise ) and his assistant Bob ( Charlie Sheen ) . Upon being fired , he becomes a handyman for a Judge ( Morgan Freeman ) , who owns vacation bungalows . Jack falls in love with Nancy Hayes ( Sara Foster ) , who is Ray's house-sitter and girlfriend . Nancy becomes tired of Ray spending so much time with his wife ( Bebe Neuwirth ) and all but seduces Jack to help her scam Ray out of $200 , 000 . Sexual innuendos and beautiful Hawaiian scenery tries to keep the viewer's interest , but before this one is over ; you have no real idea of who is conning who . Also in the cast : Willie Nelson , Tony Dorsett and Anahit Minasyan .
382295	449021	117331	3.0	Darkness awaits to rule the world .	Set in the late 1930s , Lee Falk's comic-strip superhero The Phantom ( Billy Zane ) musters his mortal efforts to stop a madman ( Treat Williams ) who wants to rule the world . Sets and photography are very interesting ; but of course the story is too predictable even for a fantasy world . Also in the cast are Kristy Swanson and the always beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones . Zane is not too shabby as a superhero defending honor and slamming evil . Of course the Phantom's outfit is more comical than impressive . Put your brain in neutral and enjoy the fantasy .
382145	449021	170260	3.0	Sometimes you just can't control a woman .	Sam Pillsbury directs this drama about three escaped convicts that seek shelter in the home of a lonely southern woman ( Kelly McGillis ) . She will give in to an extent , but she keeps her values and seems unconcerned about the unwanted guests on her farm . Billy Zane is very impressive . The other two convicts are played by Henry Rollins and Johnny Galecki . This movie offers nothing memorable , but is fine for a lazy day . My only qualm was realizing this is not the glamorous and sexy McGillis we fell in love with thirteen years earlier in TOP GUN . Even without makeup , she is a flawless actress .
383524	449021	105128	4.0	A ghoulish tale . Evil just has trouble staying dead .	This is a sequel that has no connection to Stephen King . The only thing carried over from the original is the same location . Parts of this film are gory while violence over shadows the horror . This movie has been struck with a mean streak . A young widower ( Anthony Edwards ) moves with his young son ( Edward Furlong ) to an old town in Maine . After hearing the legend of the pet cemetery where sometimes the dead are revived ; he wants to take his mother from her grave and place her in the special burial ground in hopes of her rejoining the family . The boy's best friend's stepfather is proof that the legend is true . Some of the strangest scenes are funnier than they are scary . But don't rest easy for there are times you will flinch . Also in the cast are : Clancy Brown , Jason McGuire and Lisa Waltz .
383194	449021	43914	4.0	A fall from grace .	This is a tidy crime drama about a " retired " attorney ( Spenser Tracy ) dealing with his own unethical behavior . Well written and photographed . An apt group of players support the flawless Tracy : Pat O'Brien , John Hodiak , Regis Toomey , Diana Lynn and James Arness . Worth your attention .
383862	449021	780593	4.0	Pumpkinhead is called on for revenge .	Its been twenty years since Pumpkinhead has seen the light of day or dark of night . When a small town discovers that the bodies of their friends and loved ones have been dumped into the local swamp , citizens are outraged .

With the help of the local witch Haggis ( Lynne Verrall ) , Pumpkinhead is summoned through the mummified remains of Ed Harley ( Lance Henriksen ) himself ; the hideous monster goes on a rampage of revenge at will . The cast also features : Doug Bradley , lisa McAllister , Doug Roberts , Tess Panzer , Philip Bowen and Emanuel Parvu . Violence and gore galore .
383249	449021	70622	4.0	Coil . Lunge . And show those fangs . Horror . . . No . Stupid . . . yes !	This movie is more Sci-Fi than horror . And then it is more silly than Sci-Fi . The enjoyment comes from making fun of this one . The story line sounds like it could really be good ; but then you realize the project goes limp . Some of the special effects are decent , but not enough to carry a movie . Strother Martin plays a doctor working with grant money . His project on the side is turning his assistants into snakes . One ends up with a traveling circus as the " snake-man " . The doctor's daughter ( Heather Menzies ) falls in love with her father's current assistant ( Dirk Benedict ) and fails to stop the body change process . Familiar actors Tim O'Connor and Jack Ging also appear . Rent this one with a couple of others and enjoy some refreshments . Feel free to chat back and forth without fear of missing anything . Pre-puberty viewers will rate this one pretty high .
383321	449021	26230	4.0	A European doctor is more than he seems .	Professor Paul Kriston ( Ralph Morgan ) is a well liked and respected doctor in his tiny village . The beautiful Marguerite ( Maxine Doyle ) is willing to be his bride in spite of being in love with another man , David ( Russell Gleason ) . The doctor has a hunchbacked servant ( Mischa Auer ) ; this is the clue that this is a horror flick . Kriston has suffered a vampire curse his whole life and is not even aware that he has a blood-sucking habit at night . Miss Marguerite discovers her fiancée's secret , only after she realizes she's actually in love with her other man . Things have already turned sinister . This 30's chiller is directed by Frank Strayer . Other players include : Pedro de Cardoba , Lucy Beaumont and Carl Stockdale .

The couples marriage seems to be on the rocks due to the car accident that took the life of their son and left their daughter blind . Upon taking inventory of the castle for a future sale a hideous , tortured and misshapen creature breaks lose from the bowels of the 12th century castle . Pretty gory with great horror atmosphere and some sexual overtones . Starring Jeffrey Combs , Barbara Crampton , Jessica Dollarhide and Elisabeth Kaza .
384450	449021	38990	4.0	What a woman wants . . . a woman gets .	Typical modest budget black and white film from director Edgar G . Ulmer . A tedious but interesting tale of a beautiful woman ( Hedy Lamar ) stalking man after man in the lumber country of Bangor , Maine circa 1820 . Love ' em and leave ' em . The ravishing Lamar dominates her scenes . She is drop dead gorgeous and her lips are sweeter than wine . She is also alluring and fickle as hell . George Sanders is solid as they come . Gene Lockhart and Louis Hayward are hammy ; while Morini Olsen is powerful as the brimstone preaching Reverend Thatcher . If you like costume dramas , you will enjoy this tale of love and lust .
382432	449021	30409	4.0	The singing cowboy makes the ranchers happy .	Gene Autry stars in this 1938 vintage musical western . Things get shady when crooked real estate developers ' hoodwink ' poor honest cattle ranchers . Worthless mining stock is sold for the asking in a desert mining town . Gene and his sidekick Frog Millhouse ( Smiley Burnette ) put the kibosh on the white-wash , when word circulates that gold has been found . The guitar slinging cowpoke sings several tunes including " Love Burning Love " and " I'm Beginning To Care " . Even Frog strains his vocal chords with " She Works Third Tub At The Laundry " . Other cast members include : Carol Hughes , Ed Cassidy , Polly Jenkins , Ivan Miller and Sally Payne . All in all . . . the Autry movies are pretty much formulated .
382807	449021	47898	4.0	Mad scientist misuses the Atom .	Just possibly the best from Ed Wood Jr . Wood directs and co-writes with Alex Gordon ; BRIDE OF THE MONSTER is really fun to watch and is the last starring role for horror icon Bela Lugosi . Dr . Eric Varnoff ( Lugosi ) is a Russian scientist , who has the help of his man-beast servant Lobo ( Tor Johnson ) , experimenting with radiation in attempts to create atomic " supermen " . When the dose of flesh-burning radiation fails the victim is fed to Varnoff's octopus . Loretta King plays an over-eager newspaper reporter searching for the source of a string of killings . And Tony McCoy is the detective trying to find the missing reporter . Put no restraints on your imagination and be forgiving of the over acting . Others in the cast : Paul Marco , Harvey B . Dunn , Don Nagel and Delores Fuller , who would later write songs for Elvis Presley movies .
383180	449021	420087	4.0	Never ending song love .	This is the final movie directed by the renowned Robert Altman , released just five months before his death . A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION is based on Garrison Keillor's radio program broadcast on public radio stations . This comedy is a fictional take on Keillor's radio variety show coming to an end after 32 years on the air at WLT in St . Paul , Minnesota . GK ( Keillor ) , the host , and the ensemble cast and crew have no idea that they're doing the very last show ; because a big time Texas conglomerate feels the down home country based show has played out the ratings . A diverse cast fills the roles that please the faithful listeners with their talent . Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin portray the last two sisters of a Wisconsin family country music act . Lindsay Lohan plays Streep's daughter , who writes lyrics about suicide . Woody Harrelson and John C . Reilly are the singing cowboys Dusty and Lefty that like to tell ' nasty ' jokes during their act . Virginia Madsen is known as The Dangerous Woman , who may or may not be the Angel of Death . Also part of the ensemble are : L . Q . Jones , Tim Russell , Tommy Lee Jones , Sue Scott and Kevin Kline .
383674	449021	265208	4.0	Window undressing .	This is no RISKY BUSINESS , but worth a watch . Matthew Kidman ( Emile Hirsch ) is an eighteen-year-old sheltered , straight edged , book smart young man about to turn his life upside down and inside out . Everyone's perfect and model student happens to look out his window and view his new next door neighbor . Lord have mercy , hang on to your socks . . . what an eyeful . The new " girl next door " , Danielle ( Elisha Cuthbert ) , isn't just a girl after all . She is a one-time porn star and she is now determined to take her new admirer and crack him from his shell and make him the envy of all his friends . What a way to discover life . The strong sexual situations aren't harmful , but do render R rated fun . Is Cuthbert the only reason to watch this flick . . . well , yes ! Others in the cast : Timothy Olyphant , Chris Marquette , Paul Dano , Timothy Bottoms and Donna Bullock .
384196	449021	397065	4.0	The museum of wax is not just for your enjoyment .	If you don't expect much you'll be satisfied with what little you get . This is a far cry from the beloved original HOUSE of WAX ( 1953 ) starring Vincent Price . Similarities all but nil . . . interesting though . This teen-slasher flick has a group of young people traveling to Baton Rouge to watch a college football championship game . In the middle of the night the group decide to go " off road " and rest and get an early start by daybreak . A nasty smell from the woods turns stomachs and builds curiosity . The group comes in contact with a set maniacal murderous brothers taking care of a museum in a small community that is made of wax . The wax figures inside the museum look so life-like for a reason . You guessed it . The movie is a little more than just ho-hum until the finale when the museum catches fire and begins to melt . Heaven forbid a revelation is made that may lead to a repeat . Cast members include : Elisha Cuthbert , Chad Michael Murray , Paris Hilton , Brian Van Holt and Jared Padalecki . Cuthbert and Murray are believable and you have to give Hilton some credit for possibly being the reason for some to watch this movie in the first place . She is surprisingly not that bad . The roadkill collector ( Damon Herriman ) is also a hoot . Jaume Serra directs this sadistic thriller .
382123	449021	210567	4.0	Sometimes you have to help your dreams come true .	Sally Fields directs this light dramatic comedy about beauty pageants . There is all the back biting , lying and dirty dealing your way to the coveted crown . Mona ( Minnie Driver ) at an early age has decided to dedicate her life to winning a beauty pageant . Nothing is too large to stand in her way ; even forsaking a personality is not too great a sacrifice . Ruby ( Joey Lauren Adams ) , in spite of her own lack of esteem and personal troubles , remains the faithful seamstress and best friend of the sometimes unrealistic Mona . Driver is flawless in the role of the glory seeking beauty . She also sings a sultry version of " Will You Love Me Tomorrow " . In supporting roles are Kathleen Turner , Michael McKean and Leslie Stefanson .
383207	449021	117927	4.0	A retired teacher's job is never done .	Academy Award winner Sidney Poitier reprises his role of Mark Thackeray . After retiring from thirty years of teaching in London , he returns to Chicago only to come out of retirement to take on the new challenge of teaching another classroom of misfits . This sequel does not pack the punch of the original , but is interesting if not predictable . Judy Geeson and Lulu reprise their original roles to send off their favorite teacher to America . Also in the cast are : Daniel J . Travanti , John Beasley , Dana Eskelson and Christian Payton . Kudos to famed director Peter Bogdanovich .
383916	449021	452594	4.0	Hard to agree to disagree .	Believing the hype sets you up for a let down . An unlikely couple meet at a Cubs game , with a hot dog breaking the ice . Brooke ( Jennifer Aniston ) works at an art gallery ; Gary ( Vince Vaughn ) is a host on a Chicago tour bus . When the new wears off of the relationship ; argument after argument leads to Brooke's obsession with " why can't you just do this one little thing for me " ; urging the decision to break up . Friends , family and even total strangers give advice to remedy the touchy situation . The relationship is not the only thing at stake ; the couple shares a high end condo that neither wants to give up . Of course my favorite scene is that of a rear view of a naked Brooke walking down the hall . Don't talk of a body double ; my mind will not accept the notion . To be exact , the only reason I really watched this movie is Aniston . I am not a Vaughn fan . Supporting cast features : Jason Bateman , Joey Lauren Adams , Vincent D'Onofrio and Ann-Margret .
384300	449021	486674	4.0	Not much to miss .	Based on personal memoirs of Hollywood producer Art Linson and directed by the famed Barry Levinson WHAT JUST HAPPENED is a fictional flick about showbiz . Ben ( Robert De Niro ) is a struggling producer desperately trying to save two marriages and salvage two movies . His movie " Fiercely " is in a downward spiral after a disastrous test screening and the studio head ( Catherine Kenner ) is not impressed slightly and is certain that even lead star Sean Penn can't save it . Ben's upcoming film is in jeopardy because its star Bruce Willis has gained considerable weight and is sporting a woolly beard . . . detrimental to his audience appeal . Hollywood is filled with deceit , greed and inflated egos bouncing out of control . Even humor can't get too dark . Also in this star-studded cast : Robin Wright Penn , John Turturro , Stanley Tucci , Kristen Stewart and Michael Wincott .
383208	449021	144084	4.0	Prim is not always proper .	Get ready ; get set ; go psycho ! Patrick Bateman ( Christian Bale ) is a sharp dressed man ; a player on Wall Street no less . He has a strong opinion of the music he likes and doesn't like . He treats people about the same way . His avocation is dating women only to chop them in pieces ; or hang them in his closet to die ; and sometimes practice using his chainsaw on them . One moment egotistical businessman and the next an over the top psychotic killer . A very good visual and mental shocker . At times a little bloody and at other times a blood bath . Bateman wants to confess his evil deeds and believe it or not he has trouble convincing people he is other than Mr . Prim and Proper . Also in the cast are : Willem Dafoe , Samantha Mathis , Chloe Sevigny and not enough of Reese Witherspoon .
383535	449021	462482	5.0	The population stays the same .	A traveling census-taker ( Jerry Sisto ) is assigned to visit the tiny town of Rockwell Falls . Mysteriously the population has stayed at 436 for the past 100 years . After two flat tires , the census-taker is given a ride by a Deputy Sheriff ( Fred Durst ) , who tells him not to worry about some traditions in Rockwell Falls that may seem a little odd . The town functions beneath a peaceful facade ; and when Sisto stumbles upon the truth about the town's population , he needs to flee in order to save his life . The horror is absent ; the mystery is moot ; you keep waiting on something from somewhere to deliver a punch . . . a punch that is never thrown . You continue to watch out of curiosity . Other cast members : Charlotte Sullivan , David Ames , Frank Adamson , David Fox and Reva Timbers .
383910	449021	221218	5.0	It is not easy to hide in a house of glass .	This thriller has the chances of being a real chiller . . . but falls apart . The script leaves a lot to be desired in a story that has too many holes in it . Two orphaned kids ( Leelee Sobieski and Trevor Morgan ) go to live with a wealthy couple ( Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane ) who are not as benevolent as they seem . The couple is cash strapped and intend to swindle the youngsters out of their inheritance . Some pretty wicked behavior keeps interest alive . Sobieski and Lane do their best with the characters they have to work with , but both barely unleash their talent . Sobieski's sexpot appearance is wasted . Also in the cast are Bruce Dern , Chris Noth , Kathy Baker and Michael O'Keefe .
383196	449021	91541	5.0	A different meaning to " bringin ' down the house " .	Richard Benjamin directs this comedy about a young couple and their misery trying to turn a dilapidated house into their dream home . Situational comedy makes up for the flimsy story line . Two young stars on their way up . . . Tom Hanks and Shelley Long work absolutely great together . Funny script with even funnier one-line rebuttals . Very good support from Joe Mantegna , Philip Bosco and Yakov Smirnoff .
383549	449021	43665	5.0	Sometimes truth is hard to take .	The fear of Communism runs high . Truth or propaganda ? An FBI agent turns counterspy burrowing his way into the U . S . Communist Party .

Intrigue , anxiety and revenge keeps the story moving .
382078	449021	102011	5.0	Agree to disagree . There is love to be lost .	This snappy romantic comedy pits two Baltimore reporters , Dan Hanson ( Kevin Bacon ) and Lorie Bryer ( Elizabeth Perkins ) , writing for an editorial page with opposing opinions . . . Dan the conservative and Lorie the liberal . Their popularity grows as a romance blossoms and soon they have a TV show ' He said , She said ' . Frequent bickering may end the TV show as well as the romance . The leads are very likable and the supporting cast is solid , but the film at points just comes across too sappy and gimmicky . Charming is as charming goes . Bacon and Perkins work well together . Supporting cast features : Sharon Stone , Nathan Lane , Anthony LaPaglia and Stanley Anderson .
382027	449021	60048	5.0	Guns and Apaches don't mix .	One of Audie Murphy's last movies is nothing to really brag about . But he is a genuine American military hero and extremely popular .

382042	449021	122474	6.0	" Mockumentary " of meeting between The King and The President .	This is a tongue in cheek look at an actual meeting between Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon . On December 21 , 1970 , Elvis , armed with a gun and chemically enhanced , met in the Oval Office with President Nixon . The reason for the meeting was Elvis ' request for a badge from the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs , thus making him an agent-at-large of the DEA . Hard to believe , but true . . . the visit was a success . Rick Peters does an over the top parody of Presley . Bob Gunton is a very laughable President Nixon . Also in the cast are : Curtis Armstrong , Alyson Court and Denny Doherty . Quite a bizzarre event and in retrospect you see the hypocrisy and contrasting truth to be pretty silly .
383877	449021	112744	6.0	Revenge turns to obsession .	Pathetic , disjointed and slow . Written and directed by Sean Penn , this film's focus is on Freddy Gale ( Jack Nicholson ) , who's daughter was killed by a drunk driver .

And growing is his obsession with John Booth ( David Morse ) , the driver that killed his little girl . Booth finishes doing time for the crime and moves into the basement of his parent's home . Freddy Gale is in countdown mode to commit murder . . . murder Booth . My favorite scene is Gale and Booth playing cat and mouse on a city bus . . .

Corvin and his old crew team up to ride to the rescue . The aging astronauts are as humorous as they are fit for duty ; well . The other space " cowboys " are : Tommy Lee Jones , Donald Southerland and James Garner . Garner is a bit of a disappointment among the " cowboys " , but other notables in the cast are : Marcia Gay Harden , James Cromwell and William Devane . This is a fun watch . No great shakes , but really enjoyable .
382552	449021	294918	6.0	Convicted and more than willing to die .	This depressing , but interesting drama depicts dysfunction as well as perseverance . Gary Gilmore ( Elias Koteas ) was convicted of a double murder and set to be executed by the state of Utah in 1977 . This would be of interest from coast to coast for being the first execution in America in ten years after a declared nix on capital punishment . This movie is based on Gary's estranged brother Mikal's ( Giovanni Ribisi ) book . Mikal would have several meetings with Gary during his final days with the attempt of a stay of execution . The two along with brother Frank , Jr . ( Lee Tergesen ) reminisce about the family's dysfunction , tragedy and the Mormon belief with its customs and circumstances . Ribisi gives a moving performance . Koteas seemed to caricature a poor man's Robert de Niro . Supporting cast features : Sam Shepard , Amy Madigan and Eric Bogosian . This HBO Original has a soundtrack featuring : Fats Domino , Johnny Cash , Bruce Springsteen and Elvis Presley .
383470	449021	47947	6.0	Change of plans . . . a trip to Mars .	Although it has George Pal written all over it ; it is not his best project , but a pretty darn good Sci-Fi flick for its time . A team of American astronauts assemble a space station called " The Wheel " to enable a spaceship to be built . Gen . Samuel Merritt ( Walter Brooke ) and his crew that includes his son Captain Barney Merritt ( Eric Fleming ) believe their mission is to eventually land on the Moon . Change of orders ; new destination . . . Mars . Special effects are redeemable with the most striking color and depiction of the ' angry red planet ' . Religion and human emotions are the subplots , because in the mid 50s we want to see space travel . Most of the cast will be remembered for later work : William Hopper , Benson Fong , Ross Martin , Mickey Shaughnessy and Phil Foster .
383963	449021	70290	6.0	Be a man , sailor !	Very colorful comedic drama best rented or watched on commercial-fee uncut cable for best effect . A pair of career petty officers ( Jack Nicholson and Otis Young ) are given the detail of transferring a young sailor ( Randy Quaid ) from one Navy brig to another . The hard-ass officers decide to have a little fun along the way by helping their prisoner move into " real " manhood before being locked away for the next eight years . Nicholson is a riot ! Also in the cast is Michael Moriarty and smaller roles for Carol Kane and Nancy Allen who play small time prostitutes . My favorite scene is the roasting of wieners in a snow covered park . No buns , but a jar of mustard . Hilarious fun !
384018	449021	100935	6.0	Desperate love on the run .	Director David Lynch excels at the weird magic he weaves . A love starved young woman is on the run with a paroled murderer . A psycho mother puts a private eye and a deranged hit man on their trail . Some scenes are hard to watch ; and then there are those typical Lynch scenes that you still don't know what the hell you saw . Very wicked soundtrack featuring Chris Isaak and Gene Vincent . Nicolas Cage is infatuated with Elvis . Laura Dern is down right NASTY . Willem Dafoe , definitely bizarre . Diane Ladd is way over the edge . Crispin Glover is clever as a cabbage . Harry Dean Stanton always seems to be at ease being clueless . Sherilyn Fenn , a waste of beauty to play a corpse . The erotic , violent and irreverent script is what holds this cast together . David Lynch fans get everything they could expect and then some .
383111	449021	66518	6.0	Lusty vampire mesmerizes .	Not exactly a Hammer Films classic , but really worthy of watching . There is the great Hammer color and plenty shots of bouncing bosoms and this time a bit more . . . a lot more . Ingrid Pitt plays a voluptuous lesbian vampire posing as a needy house guest . She will attack men just in order to ravish and drain young girls in an otherwise peaceful European setting . This is the first Hammer Studios horror flick to serve up full nudity . The lesbian love scenes may be the most memorable sequences in this movie . The cast also features : Peter Cushing , Madeline Smith , Pippa Steel , George Cole and John Forbes-Robertson . For a good double feature watch with another Pitt film from Hammer , Countess Dracula .
383815	449021	113367	6.0	Glimpse into the life of a musical genius .	A made-for-TV documentary centering on Brian Wilson , founder and heart and soul of one of America's foremost musical groups . Sunshine , surfing , fast cars and California girls . . . subjects of some of the most cheerful songs written by Brian for his group the Beach Boys . The Beach Boy sound in the mid 1960's was unique , honest , refreshing and relished by the young at heart from coast to coast and around the world . Brian's life has been undeniably remarkable as it has been troubled and tormented ; with seclusion in his bedroom for lengths at a time and his scrambled mental health and discord of his brothers and cousin , who continued the Beach Boy machine with or without its genius . Helping us understand a little bit more about Brian's influence are his daughters Carnie and Wendy , his ex-wife Marilyn ; as well as tributes from such luminaries as John Cale , David Crosby , Danny Hutton , Tom Petty and Graham Nash . Well worth watching : even for the non-fan .
382365	449021	22430	6.0	Good triumphs over bad again !	This movie directed by William Wellman is nothing elaborate or scenic , but a real good feel good picture . The typical good versus bad with pride and patriotism mixed in . Law abiding citizens are terrorized by gangsters . One family endures mobster threats , violence and kidnapping after members of the family witness a couple of murders . Walter Huston is the devoted crime fighting district attorney . But the scene stealers are young Dickie Moore and Charles ' Chic ' Sale , the lovable grandpa that walks away from the old soldiers home to become the story's hero .
383041	449021	48791	6.0	Bette is Queen Elizabeth .	A very impressive movie , almost majestic . The untouchable Bette Davis appears flawless as Queen Elizabeth I . A well intentioned , albeit conniving Sir Walter Raleigh ( Richard Todd ) petitions to see the Queen in hopes of getting funds to sail three ships and promising Her Highness the riches found . The Queen is not so quick with the idea , but she does want him as an assistant to flirt with . Beth Throgmorton ( Joan Collins ) is the lady-in-waiting and the secret object of Raleigh's true affections . I really got into the first half of the film ; then for some unexplainable reason my interest waned . Costumes , sets and scenery are super . Miss Collins is very pleasant to watch . Other players : Jay Robinson , Dan O'Herlihy , Robert Douglas , Leslie Parrish and Herbert Marshall .
383651	449021	377749	6.0	Confederates battle the supernatural .	Suspenseful horror . A group of Civil War soldiers rob a bank and seek refuge inside an abandoned plantation mansion .

Army hazmat specialist Carrie Freeborn ( Erica Leerhsen ) witnesses the unleashing of an organizm that absorbs light and energy and to sustain itself feeds on anything living . It is a race against the clock to figure out the entity's genetics to save mankind . Freeborn and Sears seems to know more than the military experts . Writer / director Richard Jefferies is to be commended for giving us a Science Fiction flick that actually seems to cause us concern without the use of zombies or vampires . To be exact I'm not too sure that this story line wasn't inspired by Stephen King . Special effects are simple , but better than average and pretty cool to watch . Also starring is James McDaniel of NYPD Blue fame . At times I think Leerhsen is just too attractive for this role . Other players : Dylan Kenin , Vic Chao and Jason Wiles .
382881	449021	417001	6.0	Where have all the " good " men gone ?	A real nice romantic comedy . Your family always seems to know the best for you . When it comes to love , its a crap shoot . Sarah ( Diane Lane ) is a pretty divorced pre-school teacher that is dateless and all but given up on love . . . until her sister ( Elizabeth Perkins ) posts a personal ad on a website declaring that all potential dates " must love dogs " . After several dates with weepers and weirdos , Sarah has all but given up until she meets Jake ( John Cusack ) , a hopeless romantic boat builder . They meet in the park , each with a borrowed dog and a sheepish beginning to a much deserved lasting relationship .

While working on a remote Pacific island the attacking Japanese forces interrupt construction and Wayne must convince the Government to let his men help the Navy fight back ; thus the world renowned ' fighting Seabees ' .

382053	449021	244244	6.0	Just break the code : there is government money to be had .	Action . . . explosive action . Clever script . Eye popping special effects . A strong cast , but too much confusion in following the story line . A highly successful computer hacker ( Hugh Jackman ) is coerced to help a ruthless spy ( John Travolta ) steal billions of unused government monies obtained in an old DEA drug operation . Don Cheadle is the run ragged FBI agent trying to spoil the by-computer hijacking . Sam Shepard has a small role as a corrupt Senator . The alluring Halle Berry is supposedly an undercover DEA agent whose purpose in the whole procedure is not clear cut . If you are looking for a good escape from reality ; this flick will give you several big bangs for your buck . It is good to see Travolta play a clever , bad ass thug . Some of his best work in a long time . And for the first time , Miss Berry appears topless on screen ; and in other various degrees of undress . . . so nice my eyes hurt . Vinnie Jones is impressive as a strong arm enforcer . Rough and ready entertainment worth your time .
382939	449021	118571	7.0	Need be . . . Mr . President can get tough .	Wolfgang Peterson directs highly talented Harrison Ford as the President of the United States . Pres .

383499	449021	338348	7.0	Something as exciting as Santa . . . the Polar Expess !	THE POLAR EXPRESS is a delightful holiday film that is a sight to behold . Robert Zemeckis directs and Tom Hanks stars in this sure-to-be-classic filmed in a technique called performance-capture animation based on real actors . A young boy finds it hard to sleep on Christmas Eve for he doesn't want to miss hearing the bells on Santa's sleigh . Right before midnight there is a thunderous roar . The sound is coming from a magnificent , magical train that is bound for the North Pole and Santa's house . Dancing waiters serving hot chocolate and a conductor ( Tom Hanks ) , who wants the children on board to enjoy themselves , but also wants the Polar Express to stay on time . My favorite scene is the sequence where the big yellow ticket flies out of the train and returns . Hanks plays six characters and even sings . Others of note in the cast : Eddie Deezen , Peter Scolari , Nora Gaye and Leslie Zemeckis . Besides Hanks , the soundtrack features holiday tunes by Frank Sinatra , Bing Crosby , Kate Smith and the Andrews Sisters . This movie will be one of those you'll want to watch every Christmas .
382125	449021	268466	7.0	Entertaining expose on a successful TV institution .	To expound or pontificate without just and moral actuality sustained with guarded malice and remorse would be an injustice , disservice and undeniable shame . This is a very good TNT production that is not afraid to show the back stabbing , bitching , pompous ego clashing and ' money talking ' maneuvers that made Monday Night Football a revered TV institution . Putting three men in a booth to call a football game was thought to be foolish , haphazard and ratings suicide . Just getting the right trio was not the easiest thing to do , let alone an event that would flourish without its own inherit complications on , off and behind the camera . The focal character from which this story radiates is that of Howard Cosell , portrayed excellently by John Turturro , who never played football , but could make you believe he invented the game . Cosell with his talented brand of commentary seemed well versed and articulate of any and every topic one wanted to entertain . There are other notable characters that have major parts in this mayhem that began in 1970 . There is football heroes Frank Gifford ( played by Kevin Anderson ) and ' Dandy ' Don Meredith ( Brad Beyer ) . John Heard seems flawless as major contributor good and bad , producer Roone Arledge . Outstanding is Nicholas Turturro as director Chet Forte . Forte's story alone is like opening a can of worms . In smaller rolls , but not taking away from their actual importance to Monday Night Football are Shuler Hensley playing a disgruntled Keith Jackson ; Michael McGrath as the stoic Jim McKay ; Zak Orth portraying Don Ohlmeyer ; and Chad Coleman as O . J . Simpson . High fives to director Ernest R . Dickerson and of course the Turturro brothers . Even if you were not a faithful follower of Monday Night Football or even a sports fan in general you should still find this interesting . Hardcore fans and armchair quarterbacks can use this as entertaining fodder to sustain the memory of the beast . Monday Night Football was mayhem .
383449	449021	35034	7.0	Powerful cast . Powerful action . Powerful story .	A very interesting movie directed by Raoul Walsh . Filmed in black and white is a plus especially for the scenes in the rain . Stormy atmosphere sets the mood for this story of competition , lust and love . Edward G . Robinson and George Raft work on a road crew for the power company . When they aren't trying to repair downed lines , they are vying for the attention of Marlene Dietrich . Robinson and Raft put their acting skills to the test . There is a very strong supporting cast that includes : Ward Bond , Frank McHugh and Alan Hale . Note : During the filming of MANPOWER , Robinson and Raft had to be pulled apart several times scuffling over Dietrich .
383583	449021	66473	7.0	Powerful ! Dynamic ! Realism ! Tora ! Tora ! Tora !	It takes three directors and almost two and a half hours to present one of if not the best film concerning the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor thus causing the U . S . to enter WWII . Taut , tense and unbelievable depiction of the dramatic attack on that fateful December morning in 1941 . This movie leaves a lot to be desired as far as a strong story line goes ; but the whole focal point is the Oscar winning special effects . An all-star ensemble cast features : Jason Robards Jr , Martin Balsam , So Yamamura , Joseph Cotten , E . G . Marshall and James Whitmore . Forget the rest . . . this is really the best .
383064	449021	368891	7.0	Hide and seek begins with our Founding Fathers .	Director Jon Turtelaub and the usually entertaining Nicolas Cage make a good combination and a darn good movie . Cage plays Ben Gates , an archaeologist-historian on a present-day quest for an ancient treasure of the Knights Templar . This treasure has been kept secret for what seems forever by a long line of Freemasons dating back to the Declaration of Independence . According to generations of folklore , there is a clue on the back of the Declaration that will sustain the procession of clues leading to the treasure . Thus the Icon of all historical documents , the Declaration of Independence , must be borrowed / stolen . Now Gates must out race his former employer Ian Howe ( Sean Bean ) to the mythical treasure . Gates has the aid of one of his believers Riley Poole ( Justin Bartha ) and new convert Dr . Abigail Chase ( Diane Kruger ) , who happens to be an employee of the Smithsonian Museum . This contrived tale is infectious as Cage's determination to be a hero among mortal men . This caper is held together with shards of comedy and a healthy helping of adventure . Bean seems flawless as the crafty villain . Rounding out the cast are : Jon Voight , Harvey Keitel , Mark Pellegrino and Christopher Plummer . This poor man's Indiana Jones romp proves harmless fun for all ages .

383563	449021	109446	7.0	Intense thriller . A must see .	Joel Schumacher directs an intense and enthralling catch as catch can thriller based on John Grisham's novel of the same name .

An egotistical district attorney ( Tommy Lee Jones ) , the FBI and the Mafia all suspect that the boy , found at the scene , knows the dead lawyer's secrets . The ' wiser than his age ' lad seeks help from a savvy female attorney ( Susan Sarandon ) . This movie leaves you little time to be bored . Not overly dramatic , but causing just enough tension to see you through to the end . Also in the cast are Anthony Edwards , J . T . Walsh , William Macy and Ossie Davis .
384526	449021	190590	7.0	Hillbilly hi-jinks . Bluegrass music . Laugh out loud funny !	The Coen Brothers have done it again . Three depression era convicts ( George Clooney , John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson ) escape a Mississippi chain gang and head off in search of buried treasure that will fund their new lives . Along the way , they sing on the radio and become much sought after stars as well as escapees . Great laughs and a soundtrack that is a lesson / introduction to bluegrass music . Clooney is outstanding as the fast talking , quick witted Ulysses Everett McGill . Holly Hunter plays his estranged wife . Turturro and Nelson are flawless stumblebums . Also in the cast are John Goodman and Charles Durning . Dan Tyminksi provides the singing voice for George Clooney on " I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow " , the Soggy Bottom Boys song that serves as a template for the bluegrass laden soundtrack that also features Alison Krauss , Ralph Stanley , The Whites , John Hartford , The Cox Family and Gillian Welch . Toe tapping , knee slapping fun for the whole family . You'll be surprised with how relaxed and funny this movie is .
382348	449021	47573	7.0	Mutant ants go on the attack .	This movie builds your anxiety to a minor frenzy . I think the old black and white did not hinder this sci-fi drama that still holds up well today . The creepy sound of the desert wind really sets the mood . The other effects seemed pretty darn good to be in a mid 50s movie . Of course the giant mutant ants don't look as scary as they did when I was a kid ; but they still provide something to cause a squirm or two . Mutant ants crawl up from their burrows in the desert of New Mexico . Another product of nuclear testing . They are hungry and are attacking humans as they search out food . Sounds like a movie that would be full of stupid dialog and over acting . Guess again . Understandable , but predictable script with some decent acting . Great example of early sci-fi and can be enjoyed by young and old alike . The cast includes James Whitmore , Edmund Gwenn , James Arness , Joan Weldon and a smaller part for Fess Parker .
384145	449021	252299	7.0	Why can't a guy do a little bit wrong ?	This seems to be a little noticed military dramatic comedy that deserves being looked at . Joaquin Phoenix is at his best as Ray Elwood a supply unit clerk in West Germany .

384219	449021	69765	7.0	Baseball melodrama .	There's no crying in baseball . That's not exactly etched in stone in Cooperstown . John Hancock directs this tear-jerker based on a novel by Mark Harris . Pro pitcher Henry Wiggen ( Michael Moriarty ) and catcher Bruce Pearson ( Robert De Niro ) are as different as night and day . No real chemistry between the two . To be exact , Pearson is a little slow in the brains department and is not much appreciated by any of his fellow teammates . But when Henry finds out that Bruce is suffering from the beginnings of Hodgkin's disease , the red-hot pitcher becomes more helpful and concerned enough to look after Bruce , not knowing how much time is left . As expected once the information is leaked , the whole team ends up knowing of Pearson's plight . I really wish there was more action on the field , but this is written as a drama focusing on a ballplayer . A young De Niro draws all the sympathy possible . Character actor Danny Aiello makes his movie debut as Horse . Tom Ligon plays the flamboyant Piney Woods ; and Tom Signorelli plays Goose . Vincent Gardenia as Dutch Schnell is irritating as hell . Also in the cast : Phil Foster , Barbara Babcock , Ann Wedgeworth , Maurice Rosenfield and the chatty Selma Diamond . Nothing wrong with that occasional tear on your sleeve .

Along the way Stewart picks up the aid of an old prospector ( Millard Mitchell ) and a former soldier ( Ralph Meeker ) . The prey is captured and bound and his cockiness causes the trio of bounty seekers to start turning on each other . A lot can happen on the way back to Kansas . Filmed in the Rocky Mountains , NAKED SPUR is one of the best cinematic westerns of its time . Stewart is pretty much Stewart , but I am more impressed with Ryans ' attitude that almost steals the show . Very good story line , great scenery and expected thrills filmed in beautiful Technicolor .
384277	449021	117571	7.0	Top notch , scary slasher thriller ! !	Wes Craven has the talent to scare your pants off and proves it with this well done blood letting .

Jackson , the eerie voice on the phone . This one is a supreme nail bitter .

Suspense builds as the Prince assigns the city's chief inspector ( Paul Giamatti ) to shut Eisenheim down . Sophie is found dead and a high profile investigation begins . Eisenheim helps the case by performing his most impressive illusion yet . Norton is superb ; Biel alluring and Giamatti convincing . THE ILLUSIONIST is mind-bending and worthwhile .

Terry Gilliam directs this quirky , busy heartfelt tale of a homeless former professor ( Robin Williams ) obsessed with medieval history and his relationship with a jaded guilt-ridden ex-radio DJ ( Jeff Bridges ) . Williams and Bridges are superb . The story line evolves around redemption and the search for The Holy Grail . Also in the cast are Mecedes Ruehl and David Hyde Pierce . It may take a second viewing to grasp the intended effect . This just may be Bridges ' best performance to date .
382197	449021	55830	7.0	Spooky . . . in a very good way .	Deserving of its low budget cult following .

On her way to Utah to take a job as a church organist , she passes a deserted pavilion that she can't get out of her mind .

382420	449021	161081	7.0	A slow and easy fright fest . First rate terror !	A professor's wife believes that her neighbor is a murderer ; but her personal terror is trying to cope with a spirit haunting her new home . Harrison Ford is what we think is a mild mannered genius . His neurotic wife is played by the ever classy Michelle Pfeiffer . We see a very different side of Ford and Miss Pfeiffer at one point has only her eyes to relay her torment . What I really liked best about the movie is the sound effects . It reminds me of days gone by when the sounds of the wind , a rainy night , footsteps and a squeaking door speak volumes . This movie is not necessarily too long , it just moves slowly getting to the energy packed finale . Your palms will sweat and you will inch to the edge of your seat . The terror filled twisting climax is well worth the ride .
382418	449021	139462	7.0	Pick one : yesterday or tomorrow .	This is an emotional portrait of love lost and found . A recently divorced reporter / writer ( Robin Wright Penn ) finds a tragic love letter in a bottle . The letter is written by a ship building sailor ( Kevin Costner ) who is still grieving the death of his wife . Another letter is found and forwarded to the Chicago Tribune and the fascinated reporter tracks down the love shy sailor . The dialogue is no great shakes . But the body language and character interaction spoke brilliantly . Even the dialogue between the sailor and his father ( Paul Newman ) showed love and concern . Fantastic camera work . The rhythm of the sea and the lonely beach were poetic . Chick flick , so what ? It puts you in the mood for romance on a lazy afternoon . Very enjoyable soundtrack featuring : Sheryl Crowe , Faith Hill , Marc Cohn and Hootie & The Blowfish . Along with Costner , Penn and Newman are John Savage , Robbie Coltrane and Susan Brightbill . Take two hours and six minutes to feel the romance .
382704	449021	893382	8.0	Brilliant and combustible . . . The Stones !	Martin Scorsese and the Rolling Stones . . . neither actually needs the exposure or the money . SHINE A LIGHT just tacks on to the legacy . Mick Jagger , Keith Richards , Charlie Watts and Ron Wood are all here and Scorsese fidgets for awhile trying to figure out how to film them . This documentary was filmed at the Beacon Theater in New York as the Stones were working through their Bigger Bang tour in 2006 . Raw , volatile , high-octane , bad-ass rock ' n ' roll . Longevity serves the band well . Well , it hasn't hurt them much . After Bill Clinton opens , the classic band runs through tunes lesser known as well as the legendary , such as " Start Me Up " , " Brown Sugar " , " Satisfaction " , " Shattered " and " Tumbling Dice " . They welcome guest stars Jack White , Buddy Guy and Christina Aguilera . There are old clips of the band billed as the World's Greatest Rock ' n ' Roll Band as well as exclusive behind-the-scenes moments and excerpts from TV and news footage . Mick struts and Keith smokes ; the atmosphere is electric and it is about as close as you're going to get without dodging sweat in person . My favorite sequence : " The Girl With The Far Away Eyes " . Fan or not . . . a musical experience .
382080	449021	337921	8.0	A random call for help .	David Ellis directs this stressful action thriller . School teacher Jessica Martin ( Kim Basinger ) is kidnapped in order to find her husband .

382478	449021	424880	8.0	Incindeairy performances .	A griping and intense love story from director Neil Armfield . Candy ( Abbie Cornish ) , a carefree art student , and hopelessly disconnected poet Dan ( Heath Ledger ) are hooked on each other . . . and both are hooked on heroin .

Jamal would be arrested and tortured by the police under suspicion of cheating , for how could a " slumdog " possess the knowledge to be so close to winning the popular TV game . Millions of viewers are watching in awe and admiration . . . probably more important than that final question is the fact he may be losing his beloved Latika . A definite feel-good movie . Also in the cast : Anil Kapoor , Iran Khan and Mahesh Manjrekar . True love endures all .

Also in the cast are Jane Elliot , Barbara McNair , Robert Emhart and Ed Asner . Great for repeat viewing .
383192	449021	113309	8.0	Hell on earth .	Excellent . Recounted are the events leading to President Truman's decision to drop an A-bomb on Hiroshima in 1945 and its aftermath . Filmed primarily in " tinted " black and white with the weaving of newsreel and stock footage . Witness testimonials put the explanation point on the haunting depictions . Kenneth Welsh is uncanny in his portrayal of Truman . Other stars of note are : Richard Masur , Leon Pownall , Wesley Addy , Daisaku Akino , David Gow , Ken Jenkins and Naohiko Umewaka . A must for WWII and history buffs .

383102	449021	338751	8.0	To know him is to understand him .	Martin Scorsese directs this biopic that peaks at the life / career of eccentric billionaire industrialist Howard Hughes ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) . Beginning in the late 1920's to the mid 1940's Hughes directed movies , would test fly innovative aircraft of his own design and battle his physical disabilities . His life long phobias and his obsessive-compulsive disorder would cause him to exile himself from friends , lovers and business stalwarts . The world he once believed to own would become a secret world unto himself . Most interesting is his relationships with Katharine Hepburn ( Cate Blanchett ) , Jean Harlow ( Gwen Stefani ) and Ava Gardner ( Kate Beckinsale ) . Alan Alda plays Senator Ralph Owen Brewster . Jude Law is cast as Errol Flynn . Close business associate Noah Dietrich is played by John C . Reilly . Also in the cast are : Alec Baldwin , Willem DeFoe and Ian Holm .

383189	449021	171804	8.0	Powerful . Eye opening . True life story !	Director / co-writer Kimberly Peirce puts on the screen a rather frank and sordid love story that ended in a tragic murder in 1993 .

Suffering a gender identity , Teena Brandon / Brandon Teena lived a short alienated life ; but found a soul mate that finally accepted the love of a lonely person . In Teena's mind , she is a young man trapped in a girl's body . After the transgender roll playing was discovered , Teena / Brandon was brutally raped and finally shot to death . This movie will not be for everyone . The profanity and violence is relevant to the tragic story . The rape scene is very intense and not easy to watch . The shock of the whole thing is that this is a true story . Sympathy and compassion are part of comprehension . This movie will be hard to forget . Hilary Swank's Oscar winning portrayal of Teena / Brandon is much to talk about . Chloe Sevigny , as the soul mate Lana , is worthy of praise as well . Also in the cast are Jeanetta Arnette and Alicia Goranson .
383271	449021	187393	8.0	Pride . Honor . Every brave man takes his turn .	This is a wonderful movie that will restore pride and let you walk away with the feeling of viewing a masterpiece .

Col . Martin is known as ' The Ghost ' for the way he stymies and makes fools of the British commanders . Revenging the death of his young son , Martin is fearless and relentless .

Also appearing in this smoke filled war drama are : Heath Ledger , Lisa Brenner , Jason Isaacs and Chris Cooper .
383457	449021	848557	8.0	Geogre A . Romero masterpiece .	The legendary George A . Romero continues his string of " dead " flicks and this one will not let the zombie fans down . Probably the most daring and relentlessly gruesome of them all . Intense , grisly , guts hanging out and heads exploding . . . the high-master of gore adds to his reputation for stomach turning realistic special effects . A group of college film students are trying to complete a short film assignment when Pennsylvania is hit with the pandemic rise of flesh-hungry zombies . It seems all of the buried dead around the world , not shot through the head , rise to raise some hell and chow down . A group of the students struggle for survival while filming the shocking events along their trek to safety . This is Romero at his best . The cast includes : Michelle Morgan , Josua Close , Amy Lalonde , Joe Dinicol , Shawn Roberts and Tatiana Masiany .
383517	449021	482572	8.0	Riveting story of family ties .	Gavin O'Connor directs and co-writes what sometimes looks brilliant . . . then appears like a muddled mess . Definitely an intense crime drama . Ray Tieney ( Edward Norton ) is a reputable homicide detective and good at what he does . A recent NYPD drug bust goes bad leaving two cops down and two should wish they were . Ray's father ( Jon Voight ) , a high ranked police official , pressures him into taking the lead in investigating what looks like a corruption scandal in the making . One big problem is that the precinct targeted is run by his brother ( Noah Emmerich ) . Problem two is Ray's fellow officer and brother-in-law ( Colin Farrell ) may also turn out implicated as a dirty cop . The more Ray finds out family ties tangle and pride is tarnished . When cops turn on cops it isn't pretty . When families fall apart it is another thing . This strong cast is supported by : Jennifer Ehle , Frank Grillo , Lake Bell and John Ortiz .
384258	449021	765429	10.0	Instant classic Americana .	Kudos to director Ridley Scott for pulling this together . . . and no punches pulled . In your face biopic based on drug-kingpin Frank Lucas ( Denzel Washington ) , who ruled Harlem and was total master of his domain . His product was twice as good at half the accustomed price . Cutting out the middle-man , Lucas personally made the trip to the poppy fields of Asia's Golden Triangle to make the deals and made connections to have heroin shipped stateside in the coffins of soldiers killed in Viet Nam . Maybe too honest for his own good , super cop Richie Roberts ( Russell Crowe ) diligently worked to bring down Lucas , who was believed to be making more than a million dollars a day in drug sales . Lucas would turn informant helping Roberts and a myriad of law enforcement entities arrest crooked cops and foreign nationals , who were paid handsomely to make importing heroin easy as clockwork orchestrated by Lucas . Graphic violence and language . By all appearances American Gangster is as real as you can get and one of those movies not to be missed . Also featured in a very strong cast : Ted Levine , Josh Brolin , Chiwetel Ejiofor , Lymari Nadal , Cuba Gooding Jr . , Armand Assante , Carla Gugino , Ruby Dee and Clarence Williams III .
383728	449021	285063	10.0	A legendary performer finds himself .	After much convincing , Elvis Presley does something about his career teetering on the brink of stagnation . During the last week of June 1968 , the man who almost single handedly led a musical revolution in the mid ' 50s made use of " Western Recorders " and the " NBC Studios " , Burbank , California to put on tape a TV special . The Elvis NBC Special came to be known as " The ' 68 Comeback Special " . It was originally aired on the night of Dec 3 , 1968 and slaughtered the competition : ' The Red Skelton Show ' , ' It Takes a Thief ' and ' The Doris Day Show ' . Made up of production numbers and mini-concerts in front of live audiences , this TV special afforded a lost man to find his way home . Elvis Presley was back and once again his career would regain meteoric flight . Producer / director Steve Binder would be swamped with accolades . NBC took the chance and came out looking like a champ . Elvis ' fan base would swell . The lp " Elvis ( TV Special ) " would rapidly peak at # 8 on the Billboard Top Albums chart . This 76 minute video is highlighted with a Gospel Medley , the Guitar Man Medley , and songs like ' Lawdy Miss Clawdy ' , ' Jailhouse Rock ' , ' Tiger Man ' , ' One Night ' , ' Memories ' and the great finale number , ' If I Can Dream ' . Even non Elvis fans will appreciate watching this . In a way it is like watching musical history . . . hell it is musical history .
