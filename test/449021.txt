384195	449021	420227	1.0	An old man spins tales to save his life .	After witnessing a murder , an old homeless man ( Wayne Dehart ) bargains for his life by telling the killers three stories of horror where the spirits of the wronged seeks revenge . In one tale , a young girl is drowned by cruel friends ; in another yarn , a young woman intends a clinical abortion until enduring horrid dreams of giving birth ; and the third story is of a small midterm party in a girls dorm that ends in rape and murder . This very low budget item would go better with room temperature Thunderbird in a bag and a platter of hot wings . Its hard to call them actors , but credited as cast members : Staci Harris , Timothy Eric , Tenia Yarbrough and Aziza Anderson .
383890	449021	129332	1.0	A man has got to eat .	Captain John Boyd ( Guy Pearce ) is decorated a hero of the American-Mexican War by way of cowardice . He is promoted / demoted to a rundown California outpost . A lone man appears seeking safety and tells a gruesome story of murder and cannibalism . This dark comedy is not for everyone . Some attractive winter scenery and then there is the contrasting bloody gore and vivid violence . Outstanding performance from Robert Carlyle , the most demented cannibal in the old West . David Arquette stays wasted on ' waky weed ' . Also notable work by Jeffrey Jones as Colonel Hart . Could be a stomach turner , so consider yourself warned . ' You are what you eat ' takes on new meaning .
383205	449021	260162	2.0	One hell of a virus .	This movie does have its moments , but you have to be quick to catch them . Gruesome in some spots and then others the horrible deeds are off camera . Disgruntled students want to get back at their Headmaster . A teen thinks it good pay back to download a virus on her school's state of the art computer system . Little did she know that Mangler v2 . 0 would unleash a murderous entity . A glimpse of " jiggle and wiggle " , but nothing redeeming . Just about a waste of time . The players are : Chelse Swain , Dexter Bell , Daniella Evangelista , Miles Meadows and Lance Henriksen .
384410	449021	156554	2.0	Fear comes in different sizes and strength .	Twenty foot , nine foot ; size is not that important when it involves these freaks of nature effected by insecticides and angered by underwater earthquakes . The giant ocean creatures bring fear to a tiny Polynesian island and a marine biologist ( Adam Baldwin ) and his young son ( Emile Hirsch ) try to protect them from being killed . Julie Carmen and Peter Adams also participate in this more or less waste of time .
382804	449021	382943	2.0	Some kids are just too mean !	Just as some kids can be so mean ; some movies can just suck like this one does . Don't judge the whole franchise by this installment . Its time for summer camp again and Ronnie ( Paul DeAngelo ) returns as the junior partner of camp owner Frank ( Vincent Pastore ) . Ronnie wants to keep everyone in line and it isn't easy . Alan ( Michael Gibney ) is a chubby pain in the ass and a major disturbance at Camp Manabe . He always leaves confrontations with nasty threats , but is he to be feared ? When campers and staff members mysteriously become victims of frying , burning and skinning Ronnie can't help but think of the grisly murders two decades earlier at Camp Arawak . At times pretty gross , but not as bad as the horrible acting . No sympathy to be had for Gibney , his character Alan possesses nothing to care about . This part could have been given to Rosie O'Donnell . . . and that really isn't much of an improvement . Music icon Issac Hayes plays Charlie the Chef , his last full role in a movie . Others in the cast : Jackie Thon , Jonathan Tiersten , Brye Cooper and the buxom Erin Broderick . There are as many tormented and unhappy campers as there are reasons this went straight to video .
383128	449021	47244	2.0	Not even a B movie .	Lame may be the best word to describe this attempt at horror . Primitive special effects . An attractive young woman ( Anne Kimbell ) is vacationing in Mexico and hears tales of missing persons and pets . She herself witnesses a giant octopus and a huge one-eyed amoeba like creature that may be the answer to the disappearances . Authorities won't believe her story ; not even deep-sea diving oceanographer ( Stuart Wade ) . Love interest convinces a soft investigation . Acting is atrocious . This is the debut of Roger Corman as a producer . He also has a bit part . Director Wyott Ordung too plays a role . Other players : Dick Pinner , Inez Palange and David Garcia .
382312	449021	117692	2.0	Terrifying visitors from the past .	Jon Porter ( Michael Gross ) returns to his old hometown for his mother's funeral and is haunted by evil teenagers that were responsible for his sister's death 30 years earlier . He must get rid of the ghostly demons to protect his teenage daughter Michelle ( Hilary Swank ) . Based on the conjuring of Stephen King and directed by Adam Grossman . My favorite scene is when Jon must cut off his own thumb in ritual to bringing a halt to the haunting . F / X are better than average in this hackneyed story . I found Alexis Arquette totally annoying . Also in the cast : Jennifer Aspen , Glen Beaudin and Jennifer Elise Cox . You may find this better than expected ; although not out of the ordinary .
383216	449021	303773	3.0	A cure is maybe just a sting away .	Convoluted and ridiculously lame . A scatter-brained story line is easy to cause confusion . An entomologist ( Shane Brolly ) is searching out a rain forest to trap thousands of killer wasps in hopes their venom may hold the cure for his seriously ill wife . Of course , as expected , the wasps get loose and must be stopped for they have killed before and expected to rack up a huge body count . Lethal swarm of wasps . . huh . Special effects are low budget and really not fearsome at all . At times you have no idea if the flying pests are wasps or bees . Also in the cast : Kaarina Aufranc , Roger Nevares and Hugo Esquinca . You can blame the Sci-Fi Channel and the USA Network for letting this one out .
382691	449021	43397	3.0	Not one without the other .	More of an exploitation movie using the Siamese twins Violet and Daisy Hilton . The sisters have a vaudeville act that needs some more promotion by their ' no shame ' manager Ted Hinkley ( Allen Jenkins ) . He has a shame marriage arranged between one of the sisters and a playboy magician ( Mario Laval ) . The two timing husband is shot and his sister-in-law is tried for murder . It was hard enough to get a marriage license due to regulatory laws and now it is a moral dilemma to punish one sister for the other's crime . Supposedly based loosely on the actual career of the Hilton sisters , who were born joined at the hip . Others in this melodrama : Patricia Wright , Alan Keys , Edna Holland and Norval Mitchell .
383296	449021	289848	3.0	He feels pretty . . . analyze what ?	Harold Ramis directs his sequel to ANALYZE THIS . This get together is really not much better than the first . Situational comedy that gets a little stale . Neurotic mobster Robert De Niro is released from prison and into the custody of his psychiatrist Billy Crystal . My favorite scene is when Crystal has run out of folding money and is putting change in a stripper's panties . The story line is lacking ; but De Niro is a hoot and the reason for watching . Also in the cast are : Joe Viterelli , Cathy Moriarty and Lisa Kudow .
382607	449021	60536	3.0	How deep into the future will mankind go ?	Are you ready for this ? This is one of a string of little or no budget remakes by filmmaker Larry Buchanan for AIP . IN THE YEAR 2889 is a remake of Roger Corman's THE END OF THE WORLD ( 1956 ) . A stick in the mud retired Navy Captain John Ramsey ( Neil Fletcher ) and his daughter Joanna ( Charla Doherty ) survive a nuclear disaster in their built specially for the occasion home in the bottom of a canyon . With very little food to thrive on an array of uninvited guests drop in for shelter . A chain smoking young man Steve ( Paul Peterson ) and his brother Granger ( Max Anderson ) arrive first . Granger has already become a radioactive mutant . Soon arrives a stripper ( Quinn O'Hara ) and her sleazy manager Mickey ( Hugh Feagin ) . Oddly enough the next to appear is an alcoholic farmer Tim ( Bill Thurman ) . This strange collection of folks are not only in fear of radioactive fallout ; but also the raw meat eating mutants like Granger that keeps coming closer and closer to the house . Lust , drunkenness and murder are interrupted when fresh rain falls and saves Joanna from a telepathic mutant that has carried her off to the woods . Will this rainfall be mankind's salvation ? The mutant ( in an awkward rubber mask ) is played by Byron Lord .
383335	449021	452598	3.0	Relaxing vacation . . . are you kidding ?	They're back . The Baker family , headed by Tom ( Steve Martin ) and Kate ( Bonnie Hunt ) , decides to gather a multi interest family together for a vacation . . . a memorable vacation . The Baker's decide to revisit Lake Winnetka Resort and find it is practically all owned by Tom's long-time rival , Jimmy Murtaugh ( Eugene Levy ) . These competitive childhood friends drag their families into a summer not to be forgotten . Situational and slapstick comedy dominates . This movie is very predictable . Crude humor and just plain silly . Was the first one worth a sequel ? Also in the cast : Hilary Duff , Jaime King , Tom Welling and Alyson Stoner .
381958	449021	346811	3.0	Gigantic Komodo dragons must find nourishment .	Once again genetic experimentation has gone awry . A group of casino robbers crash land on a tropical island where scientists are already living in fear . The Army has been experimenting for years developing new weaponry . . . things have gotten a bit out of hand . Genetic tampering has transformed Komodo dragons into giant , human-hunting monsters intent with wrecking the jungle as they forage for nourishment . The casino bandits don't have to think twice when it comes to helping the scientists keep the creatures from escaping and making the rest of mankind high priority on the food chain . The story is pretty lame and the cast is pretty shallow too . Melissa Braselle and Glori-Anne Gilbert are an eye full in different degrees . Also in the cast are : Tim Abell , William Langlois , Paul Logan and Gail Harris . A much better Komodo movie to check out is KOMODO ( 1999 ) .
383908	449021	280707	3.0	Col . Mustard with the candlestick in the library .	Is this Robert Altman at his best or worst ? GOSFORD PARK is a slow moving all-star murder mystery . A beastly owner of a 1930's British estate is killed during a weekend shooting party and upper crust get together . The movie is very wordy and mostly with bad accents . The murder event is not as important as the attitudes and suspicions between the high class guests and their servants . The cast members dialogue make the movie . You either find this entertaining or pretty lame . Wardrobes and sets are outstanding . Notable among this large cast are : Kristin Scott Thomas , Eileen Atkins , Michael Gambon , Jeremy Northam , Kelly Macdonald , Maggie Smith , Emily Watson and Ryan Phillippe . A hot buttered rum sounds good about now . Brandy if its handy .
383323	449021	257106	3.0	Beware : SCARY MOVIE returns .	This SCARY MOVIE sequel is a take or leave it offering . No horror and not too much more to laugh at . Outrageous , yes . The strong sexual humor and graphic language brings a questionable amount of viewers back for more . Spoofing movies like STIGMATA and THE EXORCIST , a conniving college professor ( Tim Curry ) , lures special students to a haunted house for various decadent reasons . . . mainly to get laid . My favorite scene is the sequence of Tori Spelling with the " ghostly " lover . This comedy is directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans . The cast with various degrees of stardom features : Marlon and Shawn Wayans , Anna Faris , Regina Hall , James Woods , Chris Elliott , Kathleen Robertson and Veronica Cartwright . Woods is a hoot . I was most impressed with Robertson . . . damn , that girl is nice . No doubt about having a following ; enough to continue on .
384201	449021	236493	3.0	One last heist ! Bring back the gun called " The Mexican " .	Stars with exceptional credentials can sometimes be wasted in an over ambitious project . This is a prime example . An inept criminal ( Brad Pitt ) promises his girlfriend ( Julia Roberts ) that he will change his ways after one last job . While he goes to Mexico to retrieve an ancient pistol , " The Mexican " , his demanding sweetheart is kidnapped . Gene Hackman and James Gandolfini support the toothsome twins Pitt and Roberts . The attempts at comedy are not all that humorous . The story line is not the easiest to follow . The finale is different and pretty neat . Just look for the smoke . Beware of the lack of entertainment .
383801	449021	49015	3.0	The pretty gals just arrived on the stage .	Typical Saturday afternoon at the movies western . Mediocre at best in spite of being directed by Charles Marquis Warren . This B movie is obvious low budget . Four fancy saloon gals ( Colleen Gray , Angie Dickinson , Adele Mara and Dorothy Schuyler ) are put on a stage and ran out of town . Destination , who knows where , is not reached due the stage breaking down at a way station . As the wheel of the stage is being repaired , a gang of outlaws arrive and demand the women ; they want the bad men's money , but nothing else . The girls stand about looking nice , while the villains want to raise a ruckus . . . and a whip is taken to a gun fight . Oh , well . The rest of the cast features : Hugh Marlowe , Richard Gilden , Paul Richards , Sheb Wooley and Strother Martin . It seems a long 77 minutes .
382509	449021	389790	3.0	Animated with not enough fun .	If you like Jerry Seinfeld you'll like BEE MOVIE ; if you don't . . . you won't . I'm in the latter camp , but watched to see what the hype was about . Barry B . Benson ( Seinfeld ) is a new graduate and must decide his future . Instead of being a worker bee with the same job everyday forever is not that appealing . He would rather be a pollen jock and go out into the world and collect nectar , but he knows that job is but a lofty dream for a young bee . Barry soars out into the world on his own and breaks one of the most important rules of beedom . . . he speaks to a human . He is saved from a bad situation by Vanessa Bloome ( Renee Zellweger ) a florist ; and through that relationship Barry decides to sue the human race for manufacturing honey . Some pretty big named stars lend their voices : Chris Rock , Matthew Broderick , John Goodman , Kathy Bates , Rip Torn and Michael Richards .
382419	449021	117038	3.0	Are you sure he is heaven sent ?	A cynical reporter , greedy tabloid owner and a fake paranormal expert check out the wild tip that an archangel is living with a little old lady , that might be as unstable as her story sounds . It turns out that an angel really is visiting earth . John Travolta plays archangel Michael ; although charming , he is also untidy , a little over weight , seedy and womanizing . Heaven sent ? Intended to be a light comedy ; I found it short of being a good snooze . The name Travolta did very little magic for this project . This movie has a lot of stars , but giving below par performances : William Hurt , Bob Hoskins and Jean Stapleton . Andie MacDowell seemed clueless . Robert Pastorelli did very well with the part he was given . Teri Garr sparkled in her few moments on the screen . The trailers looked so promising , but the end result seems more like a waste of talent . Mildly funny , with more ho-hums than chuckles .
382571	449021	400717	4.0	A friendly grizzly just wants to find home .	An interesting and funny animated comedy that really doesn't measure up to a slew of the most recent movies of this same type . A 900-pound domesticated grizzly named Boog ( Martin Lawrence ) ( voice ) is taken and let go high in the woods by his caretaker Beth ( Debra Messing ) ( voice ) . It happens to be three days before the opening day of hunting season ; and one hunter , Shaw ( Gary Sinise ) ( voice ) , in particular wants to make a trophy of Boog . The emotional grizzly has a new partner , Elliot ( Ashton Kutcher ) ( voice ) , who is hard to shake . The two have to survive open season in order to get back to Boog's garage home . Typical prepubescent potty humor ; the small amount of adult humor slips by most kids . Other stars lending their voices are : Jane Krakowski , Billy Connolly , Gordon Tootoosis and Georgia Engel .
382101	449021	105391	4.0	Not all things are what they appear to be . Spying is a great risk !	This is a lengthy romantic spy drama . A love story of a master spy ( Michael Douglas ) and his baby-voiced secretary ( Melanie Griffith ) . A spy story having the unskilled in spying secretary going into 1940s Germany to retrieve some valuable information about a German " flying bomb " . A very dramatic intrigue filled finale . Although I can not understand a super sleuth ( Douglas ) trying to pull off a daring rescue behind the enemy lines in Germany without being able to speak German . Also in the cast are John Gielgud , Liam Neeson and Joely Richardson . David Seltzer directs his screenplay of Susan Isaacs ' novel .
382432	449021	30409	4.0	The singing cowboy makes the ranchers happy .	Gene Autry stars in this 1938 vintage musical western . Things get shady when crooked real estate developers ' hoodwink ' poor honest cattle ranchers . Worthless mining stock is sold for the asking in a desert mining town . Gene and his sidekick Frog Millhouse ( Smiley Burnette ) put the kibosh on the white-wash , when word circulates that gold has been found . The guitar slinging cowpoke sings several tunes including " Love Burning Love " and " I'm Beginning To Care " . Even Frog strains his vocal chords with " She Works Third Tub At The Laundry " . Other cast members include : Carol Hughes , Ed Cassidy , Polly Jenkins , Ivan Miller and Sally Payne . All in all . . . the Autry movies are pretty much formulated .
384229	449021	186804	4.0	A giant city crumbles .	This disaster drama created for TV is based on a novel by a popular New York TV anchorman-turned-author Chuck Scarborough . A massive earthquake shakes ' The Big Apple ' and the city is all but held hostage by the devastation . New York City Mayor Bruce Lincoln ( Charles S . Dutton ) and his political foe Fire Chief Thomas Ahearn ( Tom Skerritt ) come to grips putting their differences aside to work together digging the city out of the ruble . There seems to be more than enough sub plots stretching this Hallmark presentation to near three hours . There are some good special effects , but nothing we haven't seen before . This earthquake flick is really no great shakes . And not unlike other disaster movies there is vast and varied talent featured in the cast : Sharon Lawrence , Jennifer Garner , Fred Weller , Lisa Nicole Carson , Rachel Ticotin and Cicely Tyson .
383157	449021	39198	4.0	Survival in the wilderness .	Low budget jungle adventure . A brief 62 minute escape and quite predictable . Leif Erickson and his transport co-pilot buddy Frank Jenks crash land in the jungle in hopes of surveying a diamond mine . While working for the mine owner Douglass Dumbrille , the two fliers encounter a savage jungle tribe . To their astonishment a blonde white woman ( Gale Sherwood ) rules as a goddess being raised since infancy by the tribe . It turns out that the " blonde savage " is the daughter of the mine owner's murdered partner . So it is destination stateside to see if justice prevails ; or will someone get away with murder . Other players : John Dehner , James Logan , Ernest Whitman and the alluring Veda Ann Borg .
384323	449021	439544	4.0	A crucial choice . . . dead or dirty !	Rough-edged drama set in a violent crime ravaged city , where a former gang-banger , Armando Sancho ( Clifton Collins Jr ) , brings his street smarts to an anti-gang unit . His partner is veteran Salim Adel ( Cuba Gooding Jr ) , who himself is drugging and dealing while working undercover for the LAPD . Sancho and Adel have their own personal demons and begin to have trouble trusting each other . The two officers have to deal with the criminal element the only way they know how . . . on-the-fly and brutal . A gangster with a badge and a gun ; with the attitude of being judge , jury and executioner . These partners are pitted against each other ; where does the trust begin or end ? If Gooding ever played a character you can't like . . . this is it . Foul language is strong and prevalent . Violence is strong . Others in the cast : Wyclef Jean , Aimee Garcia , Keith David and Cole Hauser . DIRTY is rated a strong R .
382389	449021	83296	4.0	Don't expect a get well card .	A kind of creepy , slasher flick from Canada . Colt Hawker ( Michael Ironside ) is a psychopathic killer that seems to get off on killing women and keep photographs of their last dying gasps . This crazed hacker slasher rapes and brutalizes the opinionated journalist Deborah Ballin ( Lee Grant ) . Just like her opinions , this gal is tough and survives the attack . When Hawker realizes she didn't die , he goes to her hospital room to finish the job . Some of the brutal scenes were controversial upon release in 1982 , but are rather tame by today's standards . The story line is predictable , but watchable . Ironside seems driven and ruthless . Grant somehow seems to get these roles of the strong female and plays them with conviction . . . which often becomes pretty damn annoying . Others in the cast : William Shatner , Linda Purl , Michael J . Reynolds and Lenore Zann .
382413	449021	82501	4.0	Hardly worth it .	This Jerry Lewis project does not ring with the sound of success . This film is way below the high standards that the legendary star / director has set for comedy flicks . The plot is quite simple and most of the sight gags are over done . A bumbling idiot has trouble keeping a job . He has tried being a circus clown , gas station attendant and even delivering the U . S . Mail . Unlucky in the working world , but lucky in love . Go figure . Also in the cast are Susan Oliver , Harold Stone and Stephen Baccus .
382282	449021	35938	4.0	A honeymoon to wild to forget .	William Nigh directs this early 40's madcap comedy . Morey Amsterdam's screenplay is cleverly funny and somewhat witty . The 56 minute film is fast paced with hardly a scene wasted . Newlyweds Webster ( James Dunn ) and ' Jackie ' ( Florence Rice ) spend their honeymoon in an old country home . Along with a nervous chauffeur ( Sam McDaniel ) the couple meets the town's executioner who has a fixation with nooses . Even before getting to settle in ; a coffin arrives carrying the former owner and the spooked couple call the police . When the Police Chief ( Jim Toney ) arrives it is discovered the coffin is now empty . Before this situation can be dealt with along comes the believed " deceased's " next of kin and a gang of jewel thieves trying to find a fortune in diamonds hidden in the house . This all becomes fodder for Police Chief Bagwell's attempts at writing pulp fiction . Dunn's stupidity is somewhat funny ; but McDaniel ( the chauffeur ) steals the show . Also in the cast are : Robert Bice , Eddy Chandler , Robert Dudley and Tony Ward .
383535	449021	462482	5.0	The population stays the same .	A traveling census-taker ( Jerry Sisto ) is assigned to visit the tiny town of Rockwell Falls . Mysteriously the population has stayed at 436 for the past 100 years . After two flat tires , the census-taker is given a ride by a Deputy Sheriff ( Fred Durst ) , who tells him not to worry about some traditions in Rockwell Falls that may seem a little odd . The town functions beneath a peaceful facade ; and when Sisto stumbles upon the truth about the town's population , he needs to flee in order to save his life . The horror is absent ; the mystery is moot ; you keep waiting on something from somewhere to deliver a punch . . . a punch that is never thrown . You continue to watch out of curiosity . Other cast members : Charlotte Sullivan , David Ames , Frank Adamson , David Fox and Reva Timbers .
382779	449021	252503	5.0	Talk about bait and trade . . . where is the booty of this heist ?	David Mamet writes and directs this helter skelter caper about a veteran thief ( Gene Hackman ) who is being pressured into pulling off one more big heist by a greedy , ruthless gangster ( Danny DeVito ) . Hackman does what Hackman does . . . and superbly . DeVito's character is one slimy S . O . B . and Danny seems to have fun with it . Also in the cast are Delroy Lindo , Rebecca Pidgeon and Sam Rockwell . This zigzagging story is well worth your efforts .
382611	449021	338188	5.0	A family divided comes together in need .	Director Ron Howard strikes gold again with an intense western drama based on a novel by Thomas Eidson . The screenplay is the work of Ken Kaufman and New Mexico provides some very awesome scenery . The story is set in the 1880's when after a long disappearance a father ( Tommy Lee Jones ) finds the family he left behind . His daughter ( Cate Blanchett ) is not so pleased with her father's return and intends to allow him to stay long enough to receive some medical attention and then move on . When one of her two daughters is kidnapped for Mexican slave / sex trade , she agrees to accept her father and his Native American ways to find the girl . The father and daughter team proves to be a force to be reckoned with . A dramatic heartfelt finale complete with sadness and the reinforcement of independence leaves you throughly entertained . Also in the cast are : Evan Rachel Wood , Jenna Boyd , Steve Reevis , Jay Tavare , Sergio Calder and a cameo role for Val Kilmer .
383539	449021	409182	5.0	Going down and not much time for air .	Directed and produced by Wolfgang Peterson and starring Kurt Russell . . . I really expected more and better . Another tale of Poseidon capsizing . Thirteen decks and 20-stories high , the Poseidon falls victim to a 150-foot rogue wave that flips the luxury ship over ; and as expected a desperate struggle to survive begins . A New Years Eve to be remembered . What was down is up and what was up is down ; Russell , Richard Dreyfuss , Emmy Rossum , Jacinda Barrett , Josh Lucas , Kirk B . R . Woller , Stacy Ferguson , Mia Maestro , Kevin Dillon and Mike Vogel are just a few that must trust each other as they seek safety through the flames and wreckage of their immediate underwater world . This is a nonstop action thriller with spectacular visual effects . I'm glad to see Russell's return to being a manly man . Also impressive is Ferguson aka Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas . POSEIDON is of course predictable , but a nail-biter well worth watching .
383888	449021	100814	5.0	The ground begins shakin ' ! Perfection will not be the same .	The small desert town of Perfection , Nevada is being rattled by strong underground tremors . Pulses start pounding when the town is terrorized by the cause of the powerful vibrations . . . earth worm-like creatures that measure 30 foot long . A little off beat and quirky . Sometimes a bit silly and very light on intelligent dialogue . FX are pretty darn good and this comedic Sci-Fi will get you to squirming . Fighting off these huge crawlers are Kevin Bacon , Fred Ward , Michael Gross and country music warbler Reba McEntire . Also notable are Finn Carter , Bobby Jacoby and easy on the eye Charlotte Stewart . If you like ' em scary and funny , you should enjoy TREMORS .
383410	449021	338526	5.0	More than one man can handle .	Overblown and a bit silly , but more than enough rousing CGI action to hold your interest . Scripted chaos with elementary cheesy dialogue . Let your eyes overrule your brain and VAN HELSING is a never-ending battle against the forces of evil . Fabled monster hunter Van Helsing ( Hugh Jackman ) is summoned to take on Frankenstein's Monster ( Shuler Hensley ) and a somewhat redefined Count Dracula ( Richard Roxburgh ) . First he has to deal with Mr . Hyde ( Robbie Coltrane ) in a bell tower . Upon arriving in Transylvania he enters a love / hate relationship with Anna Valerious ( Kate Beckinsale ) and together they battle lovely swift-winged female vampires and deal with Anna's brother who has become a werewolf . My favorite scene is of the horse drawn carriage winding and navigating snow covered Transylvania and jumping the destroyed bridge . I also liked watching Van Helsing blow holes in the voluptuous vampires with his gas powered spear gun . Also in the cast are : David Wenham , Elena Anaya , Kevin J . O'Connor and Will Kemp . Jackman seems to come off as a poor man's Indiana Jones . And not to take anything away from the attractive Beckinsale . . . but give her role to Catherine Zeta-Jones and you'll have a more spectacular movie .
382317	449021	39808	5.0	The dreams a life is built on .	A funny classic comedy about a milquetoast ( Danny Kaye ) henpecked by his domineering mother and fiancee . This constant under achiever finds refuge in his grandiose daydreams . He gets caught up in his dreams to the point that everyone thinks he is crazy . The cast also features : Ann Rutherford , Fay Bainter , Boris Karloff and the alluring Virginia Mayo . Wholesome fun for the entire family .
383257	449021	52969	5.0	Attack of large rodents wearing bad hair pieces .	Ray Kellogg directs a lower than low budget B feature . Sci-fi or horror ? Either way this is pretty cheesy fare . Imagine a group of people trapped in a cabin surrounded by mutant shrews . Almost comical are the demon rodents ; looking like dogs wearing body wigs of carpet scraps . This one is still scary for little kids . Don't let them see you laughing . James Best , Ken Curtis and Ingrid Goude are the human stars .
383537	449021	39780	5.0	Gene Autry : a decoy for the law .	This Republic Picture has Gene Autry and the Cass County Boys accused of bank robbery . To prove their innocence , Gene and the boys are used as decoys to find the missing money . A dude ranch is renovated and who is among the first to check into the Serenity Ranch ; dudes for sure , two rival groups of gangsters with two purposes . . . to hideout and search for the stolen money . Plenty of action ; the usual fisticuffs , horse and car chases plus Gene and the Cass County Boys sing several songs including : " Going Back to Texas " and " The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down " . Where is Texas ? This oater is filmed in Chatworth , California . To be exact . . . where is Robin Hood ? Among the list of players : Sterling Holloway , Lynne Roberts , Adele Mara , James Cardwell and Ray Walker .
384393	449021	343535	5.0	Baseball helps mend a city .	This informative documentary takes a look at the 1968 Detroit Tigers and the team's effect on a torn and divided city after the explosive race rioting of 1967 . Sporting only three blacks on the team the Tigers winning the World Series helps blacks and whites find common ground in putting their differences in the past . In 1968 Detroit was the nation's fifth most populous city and learning how to heal itself . Baseball fans and historians alike will find this hour documentary interesting .
384247	449021	55478	5.0	How a man loathes a woman .	Kind of creepy . Low budget film noir directed by Ned Hockman . Filmed mostly around Oklahoma City , Norman and Lexington Oklahoma . A black and white drama about an unemployed man Gerald Winslow ( Skip Homeier ) that physically and emotionally tortures his wife Ellen ( Beverly Garland ) . She craves her husband's love , but his sadistic pleasures forces her into the arms of a former business partner and her new boss ( Kenneth Tobey ) . Photography is grainy and some of the acting miserable . The story is interesting and well paced . Garland is perfect as the pathetic wife that just wants a little attention . She survives mental torture , rape and humiliation to find out that her husband has a fixation on his dead mother . Homeier is down right devilish and his first scene lets you know pretty much what to expect from him . The guy is a jerk , creep and sadistic low life . Also in the cast : Paul Scovil , Hannah Stone and George Clow .
382800	449021	55719	5.0	An epic tale . Cast of thousands .	If it were 1962 and I just found my favorite seat at the theater , I would be engrossed with this action packed spectacle . There was a time when everyone loved cheering on the " under-dog " . Times change , and stories are told too many times over . . . like THE 300 SPARTANS . King Leonidis ( Richard Egan ) can't convince the ruling council of the real danger that is on the way . . . a mighty Persian force on the march and counting on a massacre . Leonidis does round up 300 volunteers to stave off the Persians in hopes of Sparta sending more gladiators . Battle scenes are notable and the wardrobe impressionable . Egan plays his role strong as does Ralph Richardson . Others in the cast : Diane Baker , Barry Coe , David Farrar , Anne Wakefield , Donald Houston , John Crawford and Anna Syndodinou .
383325	449021	362120	5.0	Enough of being scared silly ?	Director David Zucker masterminds the fourth installment of the SCARY MOVIE series . Spoofs of THE GRUDGE , THE VILLAGE , SAW and WAR of the WORLDS . Cindy Campbell ( Anna Faris ) moves into a house that is haunted by a little boy . The who , why and when needs to be answered ; and an alien invasion threatens to eradicate the entire human race ; but Cindy and her gal-pal Brenda ( Regina Hall ) may have something to say about that . My two favorite scenes involve invading giant " Tr-iPods " and a comedic Dr . Phil McGraw . Almost non-stop crude and sexual humor ; some comic violence and strong language earn a PG-13 rating . Others featured : Leslie Nielsen , Molly Shannon , Carmen Electra , Chris Elliott , Anthony Anderson and Shaquille O'Neal . Sick , but still worth a laugh .
383386	449021	51437	5.0	Randolph Scott starts a family feud on the border .	Randolph Scott and director Budd Boetticher team up again with this average cowboy flick about loyalty and betrayal . Loner Tom Buchanan , on his way home to west Texas , stops along the California / Mexican border and is jailed falsely accused of being the parter of a young Mexican trying to avenge the rape of his sister . Buchanan is released , but led out of town minus his money belt containing $5 , 000 . He escapes being shot in the back and returns to town to collect his stolen money . In doing so , he must start some mistrust and anger between three corrupt brothers who run the town . Buchanan ends up in the manipulation of a double-cross to keep the Mexican youth from hanging . An obvious low-budget western , but still interesting . Also in the cast of players : Craig Stevens , Manuel Rojas , Barry Kelley , Peter Whitney , L . Q . Jones , Tol Avery and Jennifer Holden . Of note : Miss Holden only appeared in three movies ; the first being her better role in the Elvis Presley classic JAILHOUSE ROCK ( 1957 ) .
383470	449021	47947	6.0	Change of plans . . . a trip to Mars .	Although it has George Pal written all over it ; it is not his best project , but a pretty darn good Sci-Fi flick for its time . A team of American astronauts assemble a space station called " The Wheel " to enable a spaceship to be built . Gen . Samuel Merritt ( Walter Brooke ) and his crew that includes his son Captain Barney Merritt ( Eric Fleming ) believe their mission is to eventually land on the Moon . Change of orders ; new destination . . . Mars . Special effects are redeemable with the most striking color and depiction of the ' angry red planet ' . Religion and human emotions are the subplots , because in the mid 50s we want to see space travel . Most of the cast will be remembered for later work : William Hopper , Benson Fong , Ross Martin , Mickey Shaughnessy and Phil Foster .
384199	449021	236640	6.0	Going up ; going down ! Will it go in circles ?	PROZAC NATION is like a monkey on your back that won't laugh . A heaping depressing dose of life . Yet there is a flicker of light . Based on a book by Elizabeth Wurtzel . In print it would not be hard to put the book down . But on film it is like looking at a train wreck . . . how can you turn your back on it ! Lizzie ( Christina Ricci ) is a prize-winning student on her way to Harvard no less . This young journalist would love to have a career as a rock music critic ; but she goes in cycles with her friends , her emotions and life . She holds marathon writing sessions fueled by drugs and sleep deprivation . Jessica Lange plays the bitterly neurotic mother . Anne Heche is the therapist that has no way in hell to get her point across . Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is the guy she threw away . Roommate Ruby ( Michelle Williams ) has the best chance at being Lizzie's soul-mate ; but with reason gives up . And Jason Biggs is the guy who understands her the most and catches her wrath . Lizzie is a mess and hasn't got the clue to change . Ricci puts her abilities to the test and scores . . . with or without her clothes . I for one am glad that she is now a big little girl . Worth refilling your meds .
383254	449021	57083	6.0	Latin rhythms and temperamental romance south of the border .	Richard Thorpe directed a previous Elvis movie , " Jailhouse Rock " . Elvis plays Mike Windgren , who is running away from a family trapeze act accident . He is hired as a life guard and singer . Elsa Cardenas , a lady bullfighter , wants Mike's attention . The beautiful Ursula Andress plays hard to get . Mike gets over his fear of heights by diving off one of the local landmark cliffs . The eleven song soundtrack of Latin-beat ditties includes " You Can't Say No In Acapulco " and the million plus selling " Bossa Nova Baby " . Better than average travelog .
384461	449021	104926	6.0	A slugger can hit anywhere .	Even if you are not a baseball fan , you will enjoy MR . BASEBALL . An aging Major League home run slugger Jack Elliot ( Tom Selleck ) is traded to the Dragons , a favorite ball team in Japan . American ballplayers are treated like rock ' n ' roll stars in Japan and Jack is no exception . The American slugger has trouble fitting into the eastern society and thanks to his interpreter ( Kosuke Toyohara ) he doesn't completely alienate himself . Another American player " Hammer " Dubois ( Dennis Haysbert ) tries to help big Jack fit in , but of course the Dragon's new home run hitter is pretty hard headed . Elliot finds himself in his coach's ( Ken Takakura ) doghouse more often than not . The team finds him easy to dislike . Unknowingly he finds romance with the coach's daughter ( Aya Takanashi ) and that is just part of the humor found in this likable and short of heartwarming movie . Most of the humor comes from Jack's interpreter . Selleck fits the role pretty well . Ted Danson would have been another good choice for the role , but Selleck provides enough arrogance to carry it off . Not a total waste of time , but there is doubts about a double header . Twice is enough for me .
383731	449021	397101	6.0	Southern-fried hoodoo voodoo .	Slow going , disturbing drama set outside New Orleans . Caroline ( Kate Hudson ) takes a $1 , 000 a week job as a hospice worker taking care of an elderly woman's ( Gena Rowland ) dying husband ( John Hurt ) . Being a live-in care giver , Caroline is given a skeleton key that opens every room in the rundown , remote delta mansion . It is odd that no mirrors are on the walls of the rambling homestead and Caroline's skeleton key will not open a hidden room she discovers in the attic . Rain and thunder make great accent for this supernatural themed flick . Be prepared to jump to the edge of your seat a couple of times . . . you are due . Rounding out the cast are : Peter Sarsgaard and Joy Bryant .
384160	449021	64110	6.0	Explosive encounter near the end of WW2 .	This is a well-acted , fictionalized and familiar story line war drama . A group of Allies defend the last remaining bridge on the Rhine . For some reason the Nazis command wants to blow up the bridge trapping their own forces . Plenty of explosions highlight this decent depiction of WW2 . All-star cast includes : George Segal , Ben Gazzara , E . G . Marshall , Bradford Dillman , Bo Hopkins , Sonja Ziemann and Robert Vaughn .
382275	449021	324216	6.0	When you hear the chainsaw hummin ' . . . get your ass to runnin ' !	You can't tell this story too many times can you ? Almost on the same level of excitement as the 1974 Tobe Hooper original . . . Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE will get your heart to pumping . Erin ( Jessica Biel ) and four friends are on the backside of a road trip to Mexico and are smuggling a sizable load of " pot " through 1973 Texas when their van almost hits a comatose girl walking down the middle of the road . No sooner than the mystery girl gets in the back of the van . . . she blows her brains out the back window . The teen travelers decide the right thing to do is report this messy suicide and get the hell out of Texas . No such luck . In short they meet a backward inbred family that gravitates around a huge hunk o ' horror . . . Leatherface ( Andrew Bryniarski ) that lets his chainsaw do the talking . . . and slicing . Then there is Sheriff Hoyt ( R . Lee Ermey ) who seems to keep on being Sheriff long after there was no need for one . The repulsive Sheriff cops a feel of the dead girl's breast and also checks out the condition of her nether region . Nonstop tension , gore and maiming somehow blends with the coughing of the smoking killing machine chainsaw . Jonathan Tucker , Erica Leerhsen , Mike Vogel and Eric Balfour are a source of fresh meat for Leatherface and family . Biel is absolutely HOT . The girl has a top notch scream and knows how to fill out a tank top . Ermey is an absolute hoot . For the weak of heart this is a must to avoid . For horror freaks . . . this is a strong must see .
383546	449021	71276	6.0	A stake to the heart is what it takes .	An above average horror film that blends adventure with fright . Captain Kronos ( Horst Janson ) a sword-wielding hero and his hunchback sidekick are a professional team of vampire killers . Story line is interesting enough . Special effects are par for this type of movie . I knew it had me for the duration as soon as I heard the wind blowing . . . creepy and foreboding . Plus some winsome lasses to keep you entertained . Another very good Hammer Production from the UK . The players include : John Cater , Caroline Munro , John Carson and Lois Daine .
382605	449021	25515	6.0	The lights go out and a gem is missing .	In spite of a short 45 minute run time I really enjoyed THE MOONSTONE based on the book by Wilkie Collins . Reginald Baker directs a tight knit collection of performers in this mystery that takes place in a crowded house during a rain storm . Anne Verinder ( Phyllis Barry ) inherits a priceless gem the Moonstone necklace . Her fiancée Franklin Blake ( David Manners ) is bringing the precious diamond to England from India . He arrives at the Verinder's countryside home and finds a house full of guests that includes a notorious money lender Carl Von Lucker ( Gustav Von Seyffertitz ) . While everyone is assembled the storm causes the lights to go out and the necklace is snatched from Anne's neck . It was grabbed by a maid for " safe keeping " . Anne puts the stone under her pillow and when she awakes the necklace is gone . Scotland Yard Inspector Cuff ( Charles Irwin ) is to figure out which one of the guests is a jewel thief . The loud rain storm provides great atmosphere . Also in the cast are : Herbert Bunston , Evalyn Bostock , John Davidson and Jameson Thomas .
384075	449021	35958	6.0	Uplifting war drama .	Ray Enright directs this Black & White patriotic war film that of course is definitely dated ; but highly entertaining . . . with no apologies for propaganda . This movie without a doubt lifted spirits of wartime Americans . GUNG HO ! is based on a true story of World WarII Marines on Makin Island . Some very realistic scenes even though some dialog is genuinely hokey . Talk about an All-Star cast : Randolph Scott gives up his horse and saddle for military garb in the role of Colonel Thorwald . There is a young Robert Mitchum on the brink of stardom . Others featured are : Noah Berry Jr . , Rod Cameron , Alan Curtis , J . Carrol Naish , Sam Levene , David Bruce and Milburn Stone . Not much can bust up these commandos . . . except war .
383229	449021	114345	6.0	Love hurts ; aggression with passion .	Based very loosely on the work of Nathaniel Hawthorne . Forbidden love , patience and stout convictions . I really enjoyed this despite the bad reviews . In 1666 Massachusetts a married woman ( Demi Moore ) falls in love with the young reverend ( Gary Oldman ) of the colony . Her husband ( Robert Duvall ) is believed to be part of an Indian massacre on his following arrival to the new world . Duvall's character is actually captured by the Algonquian tribe and forced to live among them . He then vents his wrath on his wife , who is expecting a child from her affair with her lover . Very good acting and wonderful scenery . I did not mind the two plus hours length of this romantic drama . There is some nudity , just enough to spice things up . . . but the violence is bloody and harsh . I found this version of THE SCARLET LETTER to be sensuous , interesting and very entertaining . Moore , Oldman and Duvall were excellent . Notable in support are Joan Plowright , Robert Prosky and Edward Hardwicke . This is worth your effort to watch .
383129	449021	455915	6.0	A family tears itself apart .	An Irish family in Boston is far from tight . Cole McKay ( Michael Angarano ) is a young Catholic mid-teen who has ambitions of being a pro baseball player . His father ( Brendan Gleeson ) has trouble keeping a job and putting food on the table . Mrs . McKay ( Melissa Leo ) is deep in her faith and depends on it to take care of her family . But trouble definitely brews in this family . Cole's sister Kathleen ( Emily VanCamp ) is pregnant and leaves the house . Big brother Terry ( Tom Guidry ) is the bad seed and detrimental to the family as a whole , as if it were whole . Drastic circumstances pit brother against brother and Cole must make a decision that suites his advantage to move forward . Not exactly good versus evil here , but it does show the two don't mix well . Predictable at best . Interest does build toward the last twenty minutes of the movie . . . at least to the extent you care about the characters . This family takes a body blow ; but beats the count . . . barely .
383793	449021	120915	6.0	Where does one begin . . . at the beginning .	George Lucas may or may not have exploited his own fame and the STAR WARS fantasy . Definitely not sluggish and sometimes taxing the viewers intelligence . Some scenes seem like Lucas himself ran out of imagination . All this said . . . this prequel of the original STAR WARS trilogy does have enough merit to stand on its own and is no less visually stunning . A Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn ( Liam Neeson ) and his young apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi ( Ewan McGregor ) travel to the small peaceful planet of Naboo to assist the beautiful Queen Amidala ( Natalie Portman ) in her efforts to bypass any disputed control by the Trade Federation on the ready to blockade her planet . After a battle the Jedis and popular Queen Amidala make their way to the planet of Tattooine where they come across a young slave boy named Anakin Skywalker ( Jake Lloyd ) who appears to be empowered with the FORCE and possibly the holder of enough information to thwart the evil influence of a challenging pursuit by the Federation and evil Dark Lord , Darth Maul ( Ray Park ) . I really enjoyed the final saber duel . Really the one and only thing I disliked is the stupid character Jar Jar Binks . Just continue forward . . . an may the FORCE be with you . Rounding out the cast are : Pernilla August , Terence Stamp , Samuel L . Jackson , Ian McDiarmid , Andrew Secombe , Kenny Baker as R2-D2 , Anthony Daniels as C-3PO , Frank Oz as the voice of Yoda , Sofia Coppola and Ahmed Best as the voice of Jar Jar Binks . A star studded cast that over flows with talent and loaded with charm and intensity .
382553	449021	156729	6.0	If it is the last thing you ever do .	Don McKellar writes , directs and stars in this dry humored drama dealing with the end of the world . Citizens of Toronto deal with the world's coming to an end at the stroke of midnight and new millennium . Some celebrate with violence , some vandalism ; Patrick Wheeler ( McKellar ) suffers through a faux Christmas reunion . But he wants to spend that last moment alone in his apartment . Sandra ( Sandra Oh ) tries to get across town to commit suicide with her husband . A gas company employee ( David Cronenberg ) spends his time making courtesy calls . Craig ( Calllum Keith Rennie ) hopes to achieve sexual satisfaction with a special list of women . . . a black woman , a virgin and his favorite old teacher ( Genevieve Bujold ) . Patrick finds Sandra at his doorstep wanting to use the phone . He tries to help her home , but as the final moments of time ticks , the two are pointing pistols at each other's head . I almost gave up on this film twice ; but there was still something about it that kept me watching . Like a bottle of Scotch , LAST NIGHT requires an acquired taste .
384006	449021	421054	6.0	Famous actor's daughter becomes a bounty hunter .	Tony Scott is director and producer of this rapid paced and frantic dramatic action flick . This is a selective biopic of Domino Harvey ( Keira Knightly ) , the daughter of actor Laurence Harvey . Domino spit out the proverbial silver spoon and after following in her mother's footsteps in the world of modeling , turned her back on the ways of Beverly Hills and became a bounty hunter . Nothing seemed to dampen her rebellious and fiery personality . . . boarding school , friendships , high school and especially her socialite mother's wishes . Neither genteel or homely , Domino could go places and accomplish things quicker than her fellow bounty hunters that she called family . The violence could be no more brutal . The action could not be more intense . Point of contention : does the story on screen actually depict the one off the screen . . . well , this IS a movie and very interesting to boot . My real reason for watching is the alluring Miss Knightley . The cast resembles a name dropper's contest : Mickey Rourke , Christopher Walken , Jacqueline Bisset , Ian Ziering , Brian Austin Green , Mena Suvari and Edgar Ramirez .

Most redeeming is the special effects of Ray Harryhausen .
383329	449021	382625	7.0	Is there a code that will change the face of religion ?	This Ron Howard does not live up to all the hype ; but do not get me wrong .

384091	449021	462538	7.0	# @ " ! Homer you idiot ! Very funny .	Have no fear . Yellow power is here . The Simpson family makes good on their venture to the big screen . Outragiously funny !

384337	449021	56331	7.0	The end has come . Or has it ?	Ray Milland directs and stars in this over looked Sci-Fi flick . What will normal people do in desperation ?

Harry Baldwin ( Milland ) and his family have left Los Angeles on a fishing trip moments before nuclear bombs land on several cities , including L . A . The family continues to battle the panic filled highways to reach their destination wilderness to begin a plan for survival . Frankie Avalon plays son Rick . This end of the world film is better than the budget afforded it ; and considered the best of Milland's directorial efforts . Also in the cast : Jean Hagen , Mary Mitchel , Joan Freeman and Richard Bakalyan .
382014	449021	175880	7.0	The past doesn't forgive or forget . The future is a small world .	A study of guilt , anxiety , failure , anger and pain . Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson gives us a three hour look at several unique individuals and how their lives unwind , but weave back into the same small world . This may have been an hour too long . Stellar performances by Julianne Moore , William Macy , Jason Robards and Tom Cruise at his mesmerizing best . A haunting soundtrack featuring Fiona Apple and Aimee Mann somewhat holds meandering stories together . I don't know what the rainstorm of frogs purpose was : but it was entertaining . Foul language is prevalent ; but makes the whole thing more believable . Watch and wear yourself out ! ! !
383661	449021	26138	7.0	The monster lives ! And he wants a companion .	Universal strikes gain . Dr . Frankenstein and his monster survive their presumed demise . The doctor is urged to provide his lonely monster with a mate . Cast members : Boris Karloff , Colin Clive , Ernest Thesiger , Valerie Hobson and Una O'Connor are joined by Elsa Lancaster , the unforgettable bride of the monster . Witty and improved script with slivers of humor pace this sequel . Belongs along side the original and SON OF FRANKENSTEIN in importance to the horror genre .
384206	449021	286106	7.0	Next time will not just be a short visit .	Excellent in respect to keeping me attentive . M . Night Shyamalan's clever Sci-Fi thriller falls short in regards to the promos giving you some false hopes of a really scary story . There are a couple of scenes that come close to making you # ^ S your pants . Mel Gibson plays a widowed farmer and former man of the cloth . When crop circles show up in his corn fields as well as multiple sites around the world , shattered faith is put to the test . His brother ( Joaquin Phoenix ) a down on his luck minor league home run champion comes to live with his recently widowed brother and two children . There is the little boy with asthma and a daughter that has a phobia concerning drinking water . Screen time for the alien visitor is not much , but down right creepy . The budget must have been spent on Gibson because the E . T . was mainly in the shadows and looking like a Halloween costume contestant . Tension is high and yes you do have to wait and wait for the suspense to flop out at you . All in all , I really liked this as compared to say . . . " SPIDER-MAN " . Watch the skies ! They will be back !

Ginger Fitzgerald ( Katherine Isabelle ) and her doormat younger sister Brigitte ( Emily Perkins ) share a fixation on suicide and sustain the thought by posing for their own ' phony ' suicide photos . The girls are no doubt outcasts without concern of acceptance of their peers . Both girls are years late menstruating . . . keeping boys at a distance with major dislike .

You might say , Ginger snaps . . . with a new voracious sexual appetite and finding pleasure in biting into anything that bleeds .

She finally realizes what is happening with her daughters ; but is it too late to offer anything to change their fate ?

384219	449021	69765	7.0	Baseball melodrama .	There's no crying in baseball . That's not exactly etched in stone in Cooperstown . John Hancock directs this tear-jerker based on a novel by Mark Harris . Pro pitcher Henry Wiggen ( Michael Moriarty ) and catcher Bruce Pearson ( Robert De Niro ) are as different as night and day . No real chemistry between the two . To be exact , Pearson is a little slow in the brains department and is not much appreciated by any of his fellow teammates . But when Henry finds out that Bruce is suffering from the beginnings of Hodgkin's disease , the red-hot pitcher becomes more helpful and concerned enough to look after Bruce , not knowing how much time is left . As expected once the information is leaked , the whole team ends up knowing of Pearson's plight . I really wish there was more action on the field , but this is written as a drama focusing on a ballplayer . A young De Niro draws all the sympathy possible . Character actor Danny Aiello makes his movie debut as Horse . Tom Ligon plays the flamboyant Piney Woods ; and Tom Signorelli plays Goose . Vincent Gardenia as Dutch Schnell is irritating as hell . Also in the cast : Phil Foster , Barbara Babcock , Ann Wedgeworth , Maurice Rosenfield and the chatty Selma Diamond . Nothing wrong with that occasional tear on your sleeve .
384174	449021	157503	7.0	If you don't deserve it ; you deceive to get it .	This is a semi-hilarious mock documentary about a teen beauty contest in Minnesota . Anywhere from hilarious to ridiculous and all points in between . The only thing redeeming is Kirsten Dunst . She knows how to get your pity , concern and loyalty . Ellen Barkin is hardly recognized as Kirsten's drunken mother . Kirstie Alley is pretty darn good as the dirty dealing former beauty queen and mother of the obvious next winner ( Denise Richards ) . Miss Richards ' character is beautiful ; but spoiled , pampered and a bitch . Not exactly an expose , because the behind the scenes back stabbing is assumed to be part of a beauty pageant . Tongue-in-cheek humor . Nevertheless another vehicle for the talented Miss Dunst .

Jackson as Mace Windu , Ian McDiarmid as Chancellor Palpatine , Pernilla August as Shmi Skywalker-Lars and Jack Thompson as Cliegg Lars .

There is so much self-hatred guilt and urgent sexual expression it is hard to find just a glimmer of hope or optimism . Tragedy kills ambition .
382388	449021	74235	9.0	Exceptional look at Americans in protest .	Director Hal Ashby's screen presentation of Woody Guthrie's autobiography is cinematic pleasure . Bleak and heartfelt , sympathetic and proud . Guthrie ( David Carradine ) as a young man was trying to support his wife Mary ( Melinda Dillon ) and two small children by painting signs during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s . Just like a multitude of Okies , he left Texas thinking salvation would come from the fields of California . He left his wife and kids with her family and jumped on a west bound freight .

384298	449021	455824	9.0	Entertaining and enjoyable epic .	I have no idea where the discouraging words are coming from about this film . Beautifully photographed and two stars very easy to watch .

384027	449021	83833	10.0	Will there be fries with that ?	Produced , written and directed by Barry Levinson . DINER has been one of my favorite movies from the first time I watched it . This comedic drama takes a look at a group of Baltimore guys in 1959 . They spend most of their time at a local greasy-spoon diner discussing their collective fears of growing up . Inspite of one being married , the group seems ambition-less with little respect for women . It seems their goals are ' copping a feel ' and ' getting laid ' . These somewhat shallow characters are played by a host of future accomplished stars . Mickey Rourke plays a hairdresser by day and a law student by night . He is driven by sex and his gambling habit . Kevin Bacon's character is estranged from his wealthy family and has a warped , if not sick , sense of humor . Steve Guttenberg is approaching marriage , only if his fiancée can pass a quiz of football trivia . Daniel Stern is cast as the married friend , who is having troubles with his wife ( Ellen Barkin ) . Paul Reiser is the complainer of the group . Tim Daly plays a grad student with his own problematic love life . I really enjoyed the interaction of these young men , as they whittle away their time holding court in their favorite diner . Bumbling , arrogant , stupid and obnoxious actions of this circle of friends is played quite believably . The atmosphere is sustained by a wonderful soundtrack of the times featuring the likes of : Chuck Berry , Eddie Cochran , Fats Domino , Jerry Lee Lewis , Dion & The Belmonts , Howling Wolf , Bobby Darin and of course , Elvis . Also in the cast : Kathryn Dowling , Colette Blonigan , John Aquino and Michael Tucker . The angst of coming of age usually proves entertaining . DINER picks up the tab and leaves a modest tip .
384255	449021	477348	10.0	Terrific saga . Not to be missed !	Joel and Ethan Coen cunningly adapts a story by Cormac MaCarthy that is set in 1980s West Texas . A beginning with so much anticipation ; and a fade to black finale with your's truly expounding . . . s ^ @ t ! Llewelyn Moss ( Josh Brolin ) is a redneck slave to his resources that while hunting in the dusty Texas desert stumbles upon a drug deal gone real bad . Bodies of Mexican gangsters bullet-ridden and swarmed by flies lay by expended weapons . Moss coolly ignores a damn pickup load of drugs , but eagerly grabs a grip on a briefcase full of $2 million in $100 bills . He doesn't realize that he will soon be chased by a psychotic hit-man , Anton ( Javier Bardem ) . This is the most methodical , ruthless , no nonsense killer in movie history . One unstoppable bad ass . Small town Sheriff Ed Tom Bell ( Tommy Lee Jones ) personally knows how determined and crazy Anton is and will try to track down Llewelyn and save him if possible . At the same time joining in the chase is the high dollar bounty hunter Carson Wells ( Woody Harrelson ) , who is hired to stop Anton . Desert landscapes are photographed beautifully . The violence is bitter and most definite . Llewelyn is too damn stubborn for his own good . He seems to not know the meaning of quit . He is a welder by trade , but $2 million in a briefcase means retirement . Anton is ultimate in regard to being the most psycho killer to take unnerving joy in his obsession with everyone's destiny and gives the flip of a coin a whole new meaning . Sheriff Bell is pretty much borderline old codger with pride in the old school of enforcing the law . Wells is cocky , fearless and not too afraid of death . The murder rate is brisk and guaranteed to speed your pulse . Also in the cast : Kelly Macdonald , Tess Harper , Barry Corbin and Stephen Root . Thanks to the Cohen brothers for this bleak guilty pleasure .
