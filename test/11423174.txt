472893	11423174	288477	1.0	beyond pointless ( a true crap fest in every way )	this movie bit the big one , and i mean that in the worst possible way . it starts off really slow and boring . then , they decide to give us a sequence containing buckets of gore , with people dying horrible deaths . bad enough , but . . . the method in which they are dispatched ( pretty much all at the same time ) a mass killing if you will , is beyond the realm of plausibility even for a movie . add to that , the lack of realism in the scene i . e poor makeup effects , with really fake looking blood . what's next ? well , back to being slooooww and borrrring again and bad acting , in fact almost no effort put forth . oh , and really bad dialogue to boot . things did not improve from this point , so i quit watching before the end . i almost felt sorry for the actors , but not quite . they at least picked up a paycheck ( hopefully not too large of one ) from this mess , while the viewer merely loses a good chunk of their life . Julianna Margulies ( a talented actress ) is wasted in this movie , as is Gabrriel Byrne . summing up , we start off with a real yawner , followed by a gore / crap fest . ( ie bad makeup effects , fake looking blood ) next we have another yawn fest , with cheese ( The dialogue hehe ) and , finally a clinic on bad acting . all this for the price of admission or rental to one movie . very impressive . and that's having only seen maybe half the movie . wow . less than
472901	11423174	89629	1.0	this movie is a violation ( but my cactus liked it )	i should have known what i was getting myself into as soon as i realized some of the same people behind Police Academy , were responsible for this thing . but , i thought i'd give it a shot . turns out , all copies of this movie should be shot into outer space , where it can do no harm , at least to us earthlings . i guess if i was 12 . this movie might be funny , but i doubt it . the movie ( and i use this term loosely ) is basically about a bunch of odd characters who get sentenced to traffic school in order to get their licenses back . this movie is really bad , alright , but , believe it or not , there are much worse movies , which should also join this thing on its outer space voyage . it is awful , but there are varying degrees of awful . on the awful meter this thing ranks somewhere almost near the middle . i think my cactus liked it . i'm sure i heard it laugh a few times . as for my fellow human beings , however , if you are looking for a comedy-keep looking . a very weak
473236	11423174	312528	1.0	not suitable for kids or adults , not suitable for any age group .	this movie is pretty bad . i haven't been this bored in a long time . Alec Baldwin must have been into the sauce when he agreed to do this thing . it's marketed as a kid's movie with a PG rating , but this really isn't a kid's movie . there is some very adult language implied . yet it is not a movie for adults either , because it is so juvenile . so , really this movie is not suitable for anyone . By the way , Mike Meyers looks like a complete idiot as the cat . this movie doesn't strike me as being very faithful to the spirit of the children's book by Dr . Seuss . the only other thing i can say about this movie is it is colourful . otherwise , there is no good reason for anyone to watch this movie . a weak
472524	11423174	290747	1.0	a true z movie if there ever was one	wooo-eeee . does this movie suck . i'd say it was a b movie , but it's more like a z movie . from the 30 minutes i was able to suffer through , this is a typical teen slasher movie , except that some crazed swamp monster is doing the killing . almost right off the bat , you have the requisite sex scene between two teenagers . there is some nudity in this scene , which would have been great , except the rest of the movie had to come along and ruin it . and of course one of them gets killed in a particularly grisly way . the characters have less depth than one dimensional cardboard cutouts . but at least this movie is consistent . the music is also of the z quality , completely lame and forgettable . for some strange reason , Matthew Le Nevez , who plays the town's new sheriff , Kyle Williams and presumably , a main character , tries to play his role as if he were in an Oscar calibre movie . this movie isn't even razzie calibre . i wanted to keep watching until it showed the creature , so i could bash the makeup and creature effects as it would only have been fair . alas , i just couldn't take the torture any longer and had to quit watching . i give this stinker a low
473227	11423174	322651	1.0	quick , over here ! . i think i've found it . . . ,	no . sorry . my mistake . i thought for a minute i may have found the plot to this movie . but i don't think think a search party could have any success finding the plot to this movie . there are a few good actors in this movie , but they can't do anything to make it better . i think the movie dragged their performances down with it . as a a result , you won't find much in the way of acting here . and the dialogue . wow . awful , truly awful . i suspect they were going for something profound here , but they fell short by a long shot . this thing is really tedious . i think this is a case where they should have scrapped this thing before it was done , or at least not released it . i don't want to say it's bad , but it sure is the opposite of good . this is how i feel about the movie , and others may feel differently . all i know is , it sure didn't do it for me . for me , Dream Warrior is a / 10 movie .
472928	11423174	120177	1.0	atrocious	boy , what a letdown this movie was . compared to the animated series , this doesn't even rate . it's all of the place , in terms of tone and story . the acting is pretty bad from all concerned . i felt embarrassed for everybody involved . i found the story lacking in any real excitement . plus , for this character , there should have been a much more compelling characterization . i know it's an origin story , but i think they could have done a lot more with it . it doesn't make much sense , and i couldn't give a lick about any of the characters . the whole thing is really just nonsense . it's 94 minutes i'll never get back . for me , Spawn is a a dismal
473760	11423174	100403	1.0	An awful sequel to the original	This movie is about the " predator " again . but this time he is in modern day Los Angelles , where a string of bodies have been discovered . and this time the " Predator can blend into his surroundings again , which just happen to be sky scrapers . gimme a break . first off , this dud does not have Arnie . second it looks like it was made for 5 dollars . the premise is kind of dumb . " Predator " in the jungle i could see , but in Los Angelles . come on . anyway , this is not a worthy sequel to the original . i could not watch it all , because it was so lame . the acting wasn't very good , and there are some good actors here . i think this could have been good movie , if they had spent some money , and thought of a better idea for the story . as it is , this was junk .
473500	11423174	74875	1.0	a pointless non horror / non thrilling movie	this is not a good movie . i don't recall seeing worse acting for a long time . basically , a new student becomes bullied to the point where he is pushed over the edge . he exacts revenge by killing those who wronged him , making their deaths look accidental . sounds okay so far , right . but , this killer decides to kill other students who had nothing to do with bullying him . now there are no real " legitimate " reasons given to murder everybody . now , we get to the acting . each time a fellow student has a fatal accident , the other students show very little emotion and continue as if nothing has happened . i have to chalk this up to the limited acting ability of all the actors . in most so called horror movies , acting is not expected to be Oscar calibre , but this is worse than almost any movie in the horror genre . and things are worse because this movie has no scary sequences , so it would be nice if the actors could pick up some of the slack . the characters are like robots in their reactions , so it's really hard to like any of them . there are at least two scenes of nudity which are pointless . there is never any suspense generated , so there is never any feeling of anyone being in jeopardy . one last thing . this movie tries to take itself way too seriously , as if it is an Oscar contender . if it had been played for laughs , it may have been a better , or at least watchable movie .
472895	11423174	93220	2.0	made the first one look like a masterpiece ( and that ain't a good thing )	my sister and i had all four movies in the " House " series and decided to have a " House " marathon . we had just watched the first one , and had somehow made it to the end . but it wasn't easy . it was not a good film , at all . so , we suffered through the second one in . we managed to make it through 40 minutes of this dog , before we finally had to put it to sleep . this movie made the first one seem like Shakespeare in comparison . the acting was atrocious , at best . the budget was next to nothing as was the first one . the whole plot was ludicrous , which is to be expected , but not to this degree . nobody would behave like these characters did , given the same situations . a low 2
472974	11423174	405422	2.0	just slightly above awful ( and i mean slightly )	first off , i will say this movie is better than " Anchorman : the Legend of Ron Burgundy . i mention " Anchorman " Because it has a bit of a connection to " The 40 Year Old Virgin " in that the producer of " Anchorman " ( Judd Apotow ) is also the producer of " Virgin " . i hated " Anchorman " saying in my review that " i would rather have my sinuses scraped " . while i didn't hate " Virgin " as much as " Anchorman " , i didn't think it was a good movie . there were some amusing moments , and there's a really hot chick in the movie . mostly though , i found it tedious , boring and non funny . there are many lame jokes in here and i don't mean that in any good way . this is one movie to avoid for the most part . i'll give it a for the hot chick and nothing else .
472604	11423174	80745	2.0	Flash Gordon ( Saviour of the Universe Edition ) not good ( )	where to start ? right off the bat , it was apparent his was going to be one of those ' it's so bad it's good ' movies . and at first that's how i felt . soon , though the novelty wears off and the bad acting , bad writing , bad effects become annoying . plus , i could swear at times , the actors thought they were in a serious movie . but honestly , there's no real discernible plot , and the movie is a mishmash of other movies . it's all muddled . the dialogue is not good , lets just say . in my own personal opinion , there is absolutely no point to this movie . i remember seeing it when i was ten , and i liked it then . but i guess your tastes change as you get older . as for the special features , there isn't much of anything in depth . and the so called trailer for the sci-fi channels ' new Flash Gordon lasts all of about 9 seconds and shows nothing . if you are a fan of this movie , my advice is just to look for the regular version , which should be pretty cheap . and apparently , our friends overseas actually get the much better and in depth region 2 special edition which actually has features worth watching . so , if you can get you hands on a region 2 release and your DVD player supports region 2 discs ( you should find out first ) that would be your best bet . otherwise , it's a complete waste of time . but that's just one person's opinion . my vote for Flash Gordon ( Saviour of the Universe Edition )
472818	11423174	33467	3.0	i hate to say this but i was underwhelmed by this movie	OK , i'm certain i'm in the minority here , but whatever . i did not like Citizen Kane . first off , i didn't think it was profound at all . i also didn't think the look of the film was that great . many people say it has a great visual style , but i disagree completely . how this movie is number one all time on some lists is beyond me . to say this movie was a drag is understating things . there was and is too much hype for this movie . so it's directed by and stars Orson Welles . even worse is Welles is widely regarded as a genius as a result . big hairy deal . i was bored out of my skull . considering this movie is considered sacred and any negative comment is blasphemy , i'm glad nobody knows where i live , otherwise i fear i may be hunted down and killed . not too many people are likely to pay attention to this comment , but i don't care . this is how i feel about Citizen Kane . maybe i'm a complete idiot , or maybe i'm just missing something . either way , this movie rates a at best .
473468	11423174	462482	4.0	very interesting premise ; script does not do it justice	this is an interesting tale as far as ghost stories go . i won't go into the plot because i don't want to give anything away . unfortunately , the premise is interesting , but the rest of the movie plods along at a snail's pace . there is next to no action . the story is very dialogue driven and not enough is done with the premise . the movie is almost incomplete in a sense because the central issue is barely explored , and very little background is given as to the reasons for the strange goings on in the town , ( true we are given some surface explanation ) at least not in depth . there really is no payoff , no climax to speak of . the movie ends as quietly as it began . the acting in the move is good , the movie is photographed well , but the script doesn't do justice to its central theme . i'd have to say Population 436 rates due to its creative though ultimately unexplored plot line .
473919	11423174	493459	4.0	i found it mildly entertaining , and informative to a point	for me , this film was mildly entertaining at best . it has a lot of information , but how accurate it is , is any body's guess . the filmmakers have their view on things , and so the film probably reflects their views . i'm sure a lot of what they show and say is accurate to a point , but i think some things you have to take with a grain of salt , like most things . i think you sort of have to come to your own conclusions . this is just my opinion , of course . anyway , the film basically deals with trying to find out the identities of the M . P . A . A . the people who make up the Motion Picture Association of America . these are the people who give ratings to films . i found it interesting how the filmmakers went about trying to uncover their names but i also think that maybe the M . P . A . A . has has some good reasons for wanting the identities of its members kept secret . i mean , they may hand down a rating for a film which could negatively affect its box office and critical performance . that could mean lost revenue . you can imagine a filmmaker being angry over receiving an N-17 ( the kiss of death ) instead of an R . so maybe thee identities of the people on the ratings board are kept secret to protect them . i don't really know , i'm just speculating . the other thing is that the ratings board is not part of the government . they are an independent body , and they are not elected , so in my view , they shouldn't have to reveal their identities . doing so might give them a better relationship with filmmakers though , or it might not . . there is some other stuff in the movie , as well , but i found a lot of the stuff dry and not that interesting . i agreed with some things the filmmakers said and i disagreed with some things as well . anyway , i think the film is an OK way to waste 90 minutes or so , but i didn't find it profound or earth shattering . but again , that's just my personal opinion . the film might be more interesting if you watch it with a group of people . at the very least , it could provide some lively discussion , and get people thinking . anyway , like i said , theses are just my views . i should mention there is a lot of nudity and foul language in the movie , so this might not be to your taste . there is some violence , but i felt it wasn't that graphic . in my opinion , This Film is Not Yet Rated is a
473335	11423174	63035	4.0	huh . . .	i had read a lot of comments saying this was a terrible movie , that depicted the Green Berets in an inaccurate lite . i don't know too much about that subject , but i did watch the movie , and i was disappointed . i thought it was a real mess . tonally speaking , it was all over the place , at times lightly comedic , at times dramatic , and other times semi serious . i don't think this movie was intended to be a comedy , but it comes off in spots like an episode of the TV series M . A . S . H . my own opinion is that this particular subject was treated much liter than it should have been , and with less respect . as for entertainment value , even the action scenes were not that great , and in the dramatic moments , i felt that most of the actors weren't really putting a lot of effort into it . plus , the movie was quite preachy , with as much subtlety as sledge hammer to the head . the current rating is a , but i wouldn't give it that much . for me , The Green Berets is a
472761	11423174	66344	4.0	bah , humbug	this is another adaptation of A Christmas Carol , this one starring Albert Finny as Ebeneezer Scrooge . the only other version i have seen so far is the 1951 version starring Alistair Sim . there is no comparison between the two . i loved the 1951 version , and thought Sim was very natural in the part and inhabited the character without effort . in this one , Finny's portrayal is over the top , as is the character itself . plus , there's lots of filler in this adaptation . there's a lot of musical numbers , which just annoyed me . i actually don't mind some musicals , when i am expecting them . but i wasn't expecting this to be musical . the movie even descends into farce , at one point , in my opinion . to top it all off , it's very slow and ponderous . this is all just my opinion , and others may like it . if you like musicals , and you're in the mood for one , you might like this version of a Christmas Carol . for me , i it was all i could do to quit watching before the end .
473434	11423174	100485	4.0	boring and anti climatic	i was bored throughout this movie . it's slow moving and not much happens . it's not much different than your standard revenge tale . other than it might be more boring than many . Kevin Costner Anthony Quinn and Madeline Stowe star her , but none of them are given a lot to do with their characters . still , i liked Stowe the most . her character is the most interesting . the plot is pretty thin here , and well worn . a lot of the dialogue is clichéd , and predictable , but maybe that's just me . if you're looking for an exciting , action packed movie , this is not it . i had higher expectations for this movie going in , and i was sorely disappointed . for me , Revenge is a
473820	11423174	280462	4.0	he'll cut more than your hair ( next ? )	this is a hard movie to watch . mainly because it is so slow . if you are expecting action , you won't find it here . what you will find is a character study of sorts . the characters propel movie more than anything else . it's a murder mystery / drama that takes place in Alaska in the dead of winter , when it is cold and dark for 24 hours a day . Malcolm McDowell plays the barber , but he is more than a barber . he puts in a good performance here , and the supporting actors are also good . aside from that , there isn't a lot worth watching the movie for . instead of having an ending of any sort , it just ends . i was just hoping that if nothing else , some loose ends would be tied up . i might have rated the movie bit higher in that case . as it is , i give The Barber a . as an aside , this movie is similar in spirit to Fargo ( though i thought Fargo was a better movie ) , so if you liked that movie , you might want to check out this movie , or vice versa .
473797	11423174	65874	4.0	for me , it was too slow	this is just my own personal opinion , but i found this movie very slow . there's a lot of drama , but not much action . Gregory peck plays the sheriff of a very sleepy town , where almost nothing happens . then he does something which goes against his morals . he ends up paying for it in the end . Tuesday Weld also stars in the movie . i watched this movie right to the end , though i found it hard to keep going . John Frankenheimer directed the movie , and if you like his style of movie making , you might like this movie . for me , though , i didn't like it that much . i've seen much worse movies , but i didn't feel invested in this movie or the characters . anyway , if you don't mind drama , and aren't concerned about a lot of action , you might like this movie .
473432	11423174	498353	4.0	certainly a step ( or three ) above part I	i hated the original Hostel with a passion . so i was surprised that i didn't hate part 2 . the story is pretty much the same , with mostly different characters , so of course it's predictable . i didn't find it as sick a the first one . as a matter of fact there are only one or two gory scenes . the first 50 minutes or so are all about the setup just like the first one . , so it's kinda boring . there are a few ludicrous moments , including the ending , which ( even though it's ridiculous ) most people will see coming a mile away . and i do love the irony of it . this movie is certainly a step ( or three ) above Hostel I . it's watchable , unlike the first . nevertheless , i would not call this great film making , by any stretch . for me , Hostel II is a
473773	11423174	96754	4.0	didn't live up to the potential	i don't think this was a good film . first off , i just found it so tediously slow . it never really picked up much at all . when it gets to the " reveal " of some undersea life , it redeems itself somewhat , but not much . though i will say the special effects were pretty impressive in this regard . the problem is , we are not shown as many creatures as i would have liked . and for me , the whole movie hinges on that aspect . beyond that , there isn't a lot i liked about the movie . the acting was adequate , but nothing more . the movie is also way too long , in my opinion . i unfortunately watched the extended version , which clocks in at about 170 minutes , while the original theatrical cut was only 140 minutes . anyway , when you put it all together , the most i can give The Abyss is a .
472607	11423174	298130	4.0	underwhelming	i may be in the minority here , but i just didn't find the Ring to be a good movie . for me , it's not much different the the Grudge . i will say , i liked it a bit more than The Grudge , only because it isn't so annoying . there are a few differences between the two movies , but in my mind , it's almost the same movie . i do remember being bored and struggling to not nod off . i just didn't see any excitement anywhere in the movie , but that's just me . Naomi Watts is in it , and she's not bad , considering what she has to work with . but once again , the ghost is not scary , although it does look a bit creepy , i guess , vaguely . i didn't feel any suspense either . but if you liked The Grudge , then you might like The Ring . or you might want to check out The Messengers ( which i liked ) and Pulse , ( 2006 ) ( which i liked ) which are sort of similar but better in my opinion . as for The Ring , i give it
473117	11423174	96320	4.0	clever premise , but doesn't live up to its potential	the premise for this movie is clever and original . Two men who do not look alike and are totally different human beings find out they are twins . one is a perfect physical specimen , very well educated and honest . and he grew up on a deserted island . the other one-well lets just say he's almost the exact opposite . Arnold Schwarzeneggar and Danny Devito are the twins . so the movie should be hilarious . but it's not . at least i didn't think so . there are a few amusing lines , but that's about it . the whole " fish out of water " scenario should be funny , but again , it isn't . there is another plot which is basically a crime drama and that's what this this movie feels like to me , a crime drama . i got bored about halfway through and had to turn it off for awhile before going back to it . for me , Twins is a
473219	11423174	291502	4.0	not quite awful , just slow and not very interesting	i don't think this movie is as awful as everyone says . i think it's mildly amusing . bu ti don't think it's very interesting , and it is slow . ti don't think the acting is the problem . i think it's the script . i think it's a movie with an identity crises . i'm just not sure what kind of movie it wants to be . i don't think the dialogue is very good either . having said that , i will say i think the acting is not that great . it's average at best . no one really seemed interested to be there . but they don't really have a lot to work with . Madonna is in this movie and i don't think her acting is any better or worse than anyone else in the movie . for me , Swept away rates a
473467	11423174	324554	4.0	could have been very good , but bad writing gets in the way	Wicker Park is a movie that starts out promising , but ends up becoming a convoluted mess . the actors all do fine jobs with what they are given , but the writing sinks the film . the movie has some degree of realism and logic in the earlier stages but then quickly bogs down in one implausible scenario after another . the movie is a suspense thriller and it does deliver on that count , but who cares , if you can't follow the movie . if you are left scratching your head at the absurdity of it all , the movie loses its initial appeal . wicker park won't be the worst movie you've ever seen , by a long shot . but it will end up hurting your brain trying to decipher , who's doing what to who , and why . this movie had so much promise , and with a better script , who knows how much better it could have been . instead of being above average , the movie is choked by mediocre writing and ultimately fails .
472728	11423174	67341	4.0	. . . . and while we're at it , let's bore everyone else to death	the thing about this movie is for the better part of it , next to nothing happens . this is one sublime movie . i wouldn't say it's a bad movie , but if you are looking for action , you will have to look elsewhere . to be fair , most movies of the 70's are much slower , or seem to be , compared to today's films . there is a plot in the movie , but it takes a long while to unfold . even so , it's not hard to see where the movie is headed long before it gets there . there is an eerie atmosphere about the movie , i'll give it that much . and there is one scene which definitely amps up the creepiness factor . it is similar to " Rosemary's Baby " in its glacial pace , but it is a better movie . the ending does wrap things up , if you pay attention , but you do kind of have to think about it to make the connection with the rest of the movie . if you like old fashioned ghost stories that take awhile to unfold , you'll like this movie . for myself , i found it much too slow . Let's Scare Jessica to Death is a
473925	11423174	382625	5.0	underwhelming	after watching this movie , i have one overriding feeling . that of being underwhelmed . there was lot of hype for this movie , but it just didn't live up to it for me . it should have been better . i mean , it had good actors and a decent story . and the dialogue was OK . but . for whatever reason , it just didn't resonate with me . i guess the biggest reason is that i found it slow and boring . i found the end way too protracted fro my tastes . i also believe they could have shaved 30 minutes off of it . i also think Tom Hanks's character was too low key In this movie . for another ' quest ' movie , i would recommend National Treasure . it's not as deep , but i felt it was much more fun and action packed . but that's just my opinion . for me , The Da Vinci Code is a .
473926	11423174	470055	5.0	it was a bit different than the first one , but i didn't find it any better or worse	after watching this sequel ( which has nothing to do with the first ) to the first Open Water , i'm not sure what to think . like the first movie , this one also has the ' based on true events ' . and again i think it is plausible that events happened the way the movie shows . either way , i liked some things about , the movie but some things i didn't like . i liked the fact that we get into the meat of the story quicker this time . also , although this one also involves people being left adrift out at sea , the circumstances which lead up to things are different . there are also more people involved . to me , the acting didn't really stand out , with one exception . that would be Susan May Pratt . i found her very believable as someone who was distraught over what had happened . anyway , this time , there are six friends involved . this makes for an interesting dynamic and some genuine tension . you also don't know who , if anyone will survive . those are the good things about it . as for what i didn't like , i thought the movie dragged a bit at times . it is about 15 minutes longer , which i felt was too long . i'm gonna give Open water 2 : Adrift the same rating as the first Open Water , which would be
473025	11423174	120694	5.0	good idea , not so good movie	maybe it's just me , but i found this Halloween movie lacking . the idea was a good one , having this one take place twenty years after the events in the first and second films . all the sequels in between are ignored . however , i didn't find that much else to like about it . for one thing , i found the first hour quite slow . very little happens up to that point . plus , i thought the acting was below par in this one , even for this genre . but the biggest thing i realized , was that the character of Michael Myers does not inspire fear in this one . in fact , i found him kind of laughable . maybe it's just because there have been so many psycho villains since then , that the character isn't really that different from the rest . the point is , he just doesn't have much of an impact . i also thought some of the dialogue was pretty bad in this one . but the biggest thing for me , is that the way things happened in this movie just weren't realistic . i just didn't see it happening . despite all that , i still think it was a better film than the last one , part 6 : The curse of Michael Myers . for me Halloween H2O : Twenty Years Later is a
473148	11423174	418627	5.0	A ghost horror story with little new ( but the atmosphere is fairly effective )	Death Tunnel is really nothing new , or special . it's a horror / ghost story . and again we have the tag line " based on true events " . whether movie is based on or inspired by true events really adds no merit to the movie . I'm won't give any of the plot away , but it has all been done before . also , the movie plods along at a snail's pace for nearly 2 thirds oft its running time . there are a few positives about the movie , however . one is that it is filled with an atmosphere of choking dread and oppression , which is always a good thing . also , the raw . unpolished look of the film added more of a realism to the events . the movie also had a morbid feeling to it ( always a good thing ) . the choice of music was different , but seems to work in this case . the acting however was hit and miss . sometimes the actors were believable , other times-not so much . , if you are a gore hound , this movie will disappoint . there is not much gore or blood to speak of . there is one scene which is moderately gory at best . they should have made it gorier . this movie tries to play on your psyche , but it doesn't really work . the ghosts do not inspire fear . the special effects for the ghosts were not great , but i will say the makeup dept did a good job with the dead bodies and such . the low budget really shows in a couple places . there was one really fake looking cgi shot ( of the building ) , and one shot which was clearly a miniature used for the building . the movie has little in the way of scares , but it's air of dread coupled with the morbid feel may make you ill at ease . i recommend " Boo " instead . as for Death Tunnel , i give it based upon the fairly effective atmosphere
473647	11423174	618191	5.0	not that great an episode	this is the 3rd Justice League Episode i have seen in a row , the other two being The Return and For the man Who Has Everything . i didn't find this episode as good as either of the other two . this one has two related plot lines happening at the same time . unfortunately , we we barely even see the heroes , or the villains , for that matter . plus , i also didn't think the story was all that interesting , and the the episode was very slow paced . this episode was quite a letdown all around , from the other two episodes . by the way , all 3 of the episodes can be found on the Justice League Unlimited DVD entitled Joining Forces . anyway , as for this episode , i wouldn't call it awful , but i don't think it was great either . my vote for Justice League : The Greatest Story Never Told is a
473547	11423174	435705	5.0	good news . i just saved fifteen percent on my car insurance ,	oh yeah , and i also watched this movie . i wasn't really impressed . i'd say it was a run of the mill thriller , except it isn't really thrilling . the premise holds promise , but doesn't deliver . it's basically about a guy who can see two minutes into the future . the F . B . I . finds out about his gift and tries to use him to prevent a nuclear disaster . there's a bit more to the story , but there's nothing really that makes the movie compelling . the movie Stars Nic Cage as the main character , with Julianne Moore as the main F . B . I . agent . Jessica Biel also stars , but she is really just window dressing in this one . Cage and Moore seem to be just going through the motions here . for me , Next is an average movie at best .
472787	11423174	867286	5.0	neither good nor bad ,	but somewhere in between . James Van Der Beek has come a long way since his Dawson's Creek days . he was actually very good here . he plays a scientist sent to a small fishing community to find out why the fish stocks have depleted . Alexandra Castillo is also good as the local only ) law enforcement in the town . the movie itself is entertaining enough . there's not really much excitement though . for a creature feature , you don't see much of the creature . most of time , you are shown only a tentacle or two . there is one scene which shows the beast ( a giant squid ) but it's not a really clear view . for me , Eye of the Beast is somewhere in the middle , so i give it
472693	11423174	844894	5.0	number 4 in the series	i can't say this is an awful movie . it's just that it is so slow . until the last 15 minutes , nothing much happens . there is very little excitement , and i didn't find the storyline compelling . nor were there any great characters . there is some nudity , which doesn't really bother me . i am a guy , after all . and though there isn't a lot of profanity , what profanity there was , i felt was unnecessary and did not have any context in the movie . i don't mind profanity , but there should be a purpose or reason for it . but there is some good news . the special makeup and creature effects were pretty good overall . the acting was OK . and this movie is certainly better than the unfortunate Species 2 . i don't think it's as good as the original Species , and it's certainly nowhere near as good as Species 3 , which to me , is the best of the series . to me , this movie is somewhere in the middle . i give Species : The Awakening
473201	11423174	95993	5.0	disappointing sequel	i didn't think this this sequel to The Man From Snowy River was that great . i thought it was too drawn out . plus , it was fairly heavy on the romance angle , which isn't my cup of tea . Tom Burlinson returns as Jim Craig , the title character in the first movie . Sigrid Thornton returns as his love interest . Kurt Douglas played her father , Harrison , in the original . Brian Denehey plays that role in this movie . this is not the worst movie i have seen , but it wasn't as good as i'd hoped . still , just like the first one , there is some very beautiful scenery , and a great musical score . Burlinson and Thornton are both decent actors , at least in this movie . Dennehy is also good . for me , Return to Snowy River is a
473225	11423174	87050	5.0	creepy music , but no real scares	not bad , i guess . it had some creepy moments , courtesy of some ' Omen ' type music . you know , the chanting in Latin . it wasn't really scary , though . the concept is neat , but not wholly original . there was an original Star Trek episode that may have inspired the idea for the short story . and it also has elements of the 70's movie The Wicker Man . anyway , it's certainly got Stephen King written all over it . it's quite twisted , to say the least . it's not very graphic at all though . in fact , it's quite tame . i thought it could have been a TV movie , actually . i even checked this site to see if it was . the effects are cheesy , but i've seen a lot worse . the acting is OK , for the most part . but the guy who played the cult leader was very convincing . he exuded evil . the acting by the children was adequate , i guess , although one of the girls was very good in her role . i did feel that the guy who played the second in command tended to overact a bit . he was kinda creepy though . there have been countless sequels , and watching this movie doesn't inspire me to run out and watch any of them , though i may watch them in time . for me , Children of the Corn is a
473638	11423174	211181	5.0	a pale imitation of it's predecessor	unfortunately , this second live action film is a pale imitation of its predecessor . it's a lot slower , and the story feels contrived . it almost seems like filler to me . there are a few comic moments , though not as many as its predecessor . i think they should have left it at the first one , 101 Dalmatians . Glenn Close returns as Cruella De Vil , and is good , but has much less to do this time around . plus , her two henchmen form th preventions film are not in this one , and they added some comic relief . Gerard Depardieu is in this one , in a completely ridiculous role , and he looks quite silly , to be polite . despite its problems its still watchable . my vote for 102 Dalmations is a
473036	11423174	66049	6.0	authentic portrayal of the Sioux Indians of the time	at the beginning of this movie , there is a blurb about how the events portrayed are taken directly from historical documents of the period . the South Dakota Sioux Indians also had a lot of input into the movie . so , we can assume it is fairly accurate . one thing it does is show the Native American Indians as being just like any other people . this movie took awhile to get going , in my mind , but once it does , it's action packed , and it's very well acted . Richard Harris is the title character . he is a British Lord who is captured by the Sioux in the mid 1800's . first he is treated with disdain , as nothing more than a servant to the aging mother of the chief . gradually , though , things change , though , and he becomes much more . this is a very touching and heart breaking movie . it's also very thought provoking . overall , i give A Man Called Horse a
473092	11423174	105179	6.0	the most eerie and suspenseful of the four	to me , this movie is the best of the four . it's the most suspenseful and creepy . the story has a mostly religious bent to it , and of course there is the Latin chanting which comes with these movies . for me , i find that very eerie , to say the least . the music is quite eerie , as well . the suspense in this movie is quite high . to me , it became almost unbearable at times . the idea of a fanatical nut thinking it is their job to cleanse people of sin ( by killing them ) isn't really new or original today . it wasn't really original back in 1991 when this movie was released . but , for me , it worked in this case . . while this is no masterpiece , i did like it . one thing i didn't like was the potty mouth of one of the female characters . i just didn't think it was necessary . for me , Prom Night IV : Deliver us From Evil is a
473060	11423174	212235	6.0	one of the more entertaining teen / horror spoofs	my personal feeling is that this movie is better than any of the Scary Movie Films . i found it more relevant and clever . it is better paced , with no real spots that lag . the jokes do fly literally about every few seconds . i woudn't say it is funny , but there are some very amusing moments . i particularly liked the end stages of the film . to me , this film is lighter in tone than the Scary Movie franchise . it's also not as gross . the violence is also less graphic , and the language is much tamer . there is very little in the way of nudity , and most of the sexual situations are implied . the movie is rated R , but i'm not sure why . after watching it , i thought it would be PG-1 , at most . i checked the rating after watching , and i'm really surprised . from my viewpoint , i think this movie would be suitable for most kids 13 or older , but parents should use their discretion , of course . either way , i thought this movie was pretty entertaining all the way through . it's no masterpiece , but i give this movie a
473857	11423174	78295	6.0	John Carpenter's third film	while i admit there is lots of tension in this movie , it's almost too much . the problem i found is that ( to me at least ) the movie keeps building to a climax which is less exciting than the rest of the movie . there is one pretty thrilling moment in the movie , but for me , that's about it . this is by no means a bad movie . in fact , think it was very well done and the acting is top rate . i just felt it was too drawn out . this is John carpenter's third picture , and was intended for the big screen at one point . but somewhere along the line , it was decided to make it into a TV movie . it's not overly violent and certainly not very graphic . even though i thought the movie was drawn out , it was still entertaining enough o watch until the end . if you don't mind a really slow build up , you will probably enjoy this one . by the way , this movie also available as part of the Twisted Terror collection , which also includes five other horror movies . anyway , for me , Someone's Watching Me is a
473581	11423174	478087	6.0	liked it , didn't love it	while i liked this movie , i didn't love it . it was entertaining , but not really very substantive . plus , while watching , i couldn't help but think i'd had seen the movie before , under a different title and with different actors . the name of said movie still escapes me . to be fair though , when you make a film centered around the subject of gambling , there's isn't too much you can do to distinguish one from another . i will say , though , that i thought Kevin Spacey was brilliant in his performance and Laurence Fishburne was equally good . Spacey and Fishburne owned the movie in their scenes . Kate Bosworth and Jim Sturgess were also in the movie , but were overshadowed by Spacey & & & possible minor spoilerSpacey and Fishburne are hardly really in the movie and i don't think he and i don't think they had any scenes together . i was mildly entertained , and never bored , but nothing beyond that . for me , 21 is a
472763	11423174	37536	6.0	sequel to Going my Way	this is the sequel and more famous cousin to Going my Way . Bing Crosby reprises his role of Father O'Malley . Ingrid Bergman co-stars . this movie is much deeper than it's predecessor , and has a much better , stronger story . Crosby and Bergman are both brilliant here . the story has some very touching moments . i welled up a few times . there are strong themes of hope and faith and miracles here , and the human spirit . wheres there are a quite a few lighter , comedic moments in Going my Way , there aren't that many here . it's much more serious in tone . i don't know if Bergman and / or Crosby won academy awards for their portrayals , but they give award worthy performance . the movie does feel a bit long and there are some slow moments , but overall , i liked it . i give The Bells of St . Mary's a
473796	11423174	60862	6.0	not bad , though i found it slow at times	this western tells the story of four men , each a specialist in a different field , hired to rescue a woman kidnapped by a Mexican revolutionary . of course it's not quite as straightforward as that , and things don't quite go the way they should . it stars Lee Marvin , Burt Lancaster , Ralph Bellamy and Jack Palance , among others . i didn't mind the movie , but i thought it would be a bit better than it was . for me , there just wasn't a lot of action , but there was a lot of talking . it sort of reminded me a bit of the Dirty Dozen , though i liked that movie better . still , this movie is entertaining enough , if not fast paced . i think you could do a lot worse with two hours of your time . for me , it rates a
473124	11423174	14532	6.0	not bad for a silent movie made in 1923	this is the first film version of The Ten Commandments . it is directed by Cecil B . Demille , who also directed the 1956 version . this version is very lean , going through the events of that time , very quickly . in 50 minutes , in fact . i'm guessing they just kept the essentials of the story , without anything extra . the special effects are quite something for that day . the film must have been a grand undertaking . the remaining 80 minutes or so is a morality play set in more modern times ( around 1923 , i'm guessing ) concerning how the Ten Commandments relate to modern life , and what happens if we don't obey them . for me , this second half is just way too heavy handed and preachy . the message is a good one , but it feels like you're being hit over the head with sledgehammer . some of the acting may seem a bit exaggerated , but they had to act that way , since they didn't have sound . there is an orchestral accompaniment , that plays through out the film . the only problem is , i found the music too repetitive . it got annoying after awhile . still , considering that this movie was mad in 1923 , it's not too bad . my vote for The Ten Commandments ( 1923 ) is a
472601	11423174	98382	6.0	not as bad as people say	i don't get it . people say this is the worst Star Trek movie of them all . i'm not sure i agree . i kinda liked it . i know it's not action packed to say the least , and the plot may be unusual , but so what . i found this movie to have a fair amount of humour in it , not as much as the fourth installment , but some . the whole movie is really one 105 minute philosophy lesson , but that didn't really bother me . personally , i thought the story was interesting . enough to maintain my interest for the full running time . i wasn't bored at all . the premise could be called absurd , but it's certainly no more absurd than a lot of other films that get churned out . i think it was better than The first Star Trek movie and as good as the second one ( The Wrath of Kahn ) . i realize i may be in the minority here , but that's life . for me , Star Trek 6 : The Final Frontier is a
472914	11423174	452766	6.0	it's not the worst B movie i've seen	this is one sick and twisted movie . there isn't a lot of gore , but what gore there is , is pretty extreme . i also thought there was some continuity problems . some of the scenes don't seem to have any context , so it is hard to follow . it's a B movie , for sure , but , despite its problems , i thought it was OK . i liked the music and the atmosphere , and the story was interesting , though not completely original . think Evil Dead and a bit of Child's Play . i didn't think the acting was too bad . i don't think it was great , but i have seen much worse . towards the end , there is a hysterical scene , which sorta reminded me of the Child's Play movies . for me Curse of the Maya , AKA Dawn of the Living Dead ( nothing to do with George A . Romero's " Dead " series ) is a
473752	11423174	58461	6.0	the first in the Man With No Name trilogy	it took me awhile to get around to watching this movie , which is considered a classic by a lot of people . it was a bit too sedate for my tastes , although it wasn't a horrible movie and it probably bears viewing at least twice . it's the first of three movies in the Man With no Name trilogy , directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood as the man with no name . he's also the quiet man with no name . the character doesn't say much unless he needs to . he's brooding and mysterious , and doesn't give too much away about himself . he's also calm and cool , at least on the outside , showing little or no outward emotion . Eastwood is the perfect actor to play this character . though he was in the series Rawhide , it was apparently this series that rocketed him to fame . although i thought there were some slow moment here and there , i didn't hate the film , and i can understand why it has the following and reputation it does . for me , Fistful of Dollars is a
472899	11423174	469111	6.0	At least they didn't kill the hot chick right away	here we go again . another slasher flick , but with a twist-just kidding , at least about the twist . i was pretty bored through this one . first off the requisite nut bar doesn't even start killing people soon enough . and when said killings do occur , the death scenes are lame . the director tries to fool us with flashy camera tricks and loud music , but alas to know avail . this thing is predictable from the get go . the only question is who survives . i mean someone has to survive , so they can either be killed in the next ( i hope not ) installment or do the killing . naturally the characters are complete morons , even tasking stupidity to a whole new level in some scenes . so , nu-me nu-me nu-me , ( not an actual word , i know ) we sit and wait for them to be dispatched one by one . i did care when on of the characters got killed , because she is so hot . the bastards ! they have to kill the hot one every time . Oh , well , i keep watching , so what do i expect ? for keeping the hot chick alive for awhile .
472991	11423174	411061	6.0	decent time killer	i guess this wasn't a horrible movie . it just wasn't that great either . it's a pretty standard , generic crime drama / mystery . there are some scenes that could have been from any movie of the genre . AL Pacino is the headliner here , and looks like he's sleepwalking through the part . Leelee Sobieski , Deborah Kara Unger , Neil McDonough , and Alicia Witt also star . I like Alicia Witt as an actress , and she does OK here . in fact , i'd say she the best of the bunch . but she has little to work with . the movie itself is mostly implausible . it just doesn't add up . there's no real suspense or intensity . despite hat , i was entertained for the 101 minute running time . the movie is fairly fast paced . for me , 88 minutes is a
473753	11423174	1028528	6.0	the woods are lovely , dark and deep . . . and i have promises to keep . . . and miles to go before i sleep	Quentin Tarantino's homage to 70's exploitation films is not as good as the other half of the Grindhouse feature , Planet Terror . this one has some really great 70's music and some good dialogue , although some of it seems contrived , and i just didn't think it was as clever as Planet Terror . it takes awhile too get going , and once it does get going , it's not bad , though not as exciting as it should have been . there's an ensemble cast here , and all are good . Kurt Russel is perfectly cast as Stuntman Mike , an insane driving terror , who happens to terrorize the wrong women and gets a taste of his own medicine . there's a lot of very frequent oars language here and a bit of gore . unfortunately , this movie just isn't as fun as i hoped . not horrible , just not great . for me , Death Proof is a
472683	11423174	758758	6.0	a bit long at 148 minutes	this movie is basically about a man who abandons a life of comfort and gives away all his money to go live in the wild . along his journey , he meets some interesting characters and learns things about himself . it's another " based on a true story " movie . i liked some things about this movie , and didn't like some other things . i liked all the interesting people he met . i like the fact that he had the courage to live like he wanted to , not how society dictated . you might think he was crazy to live like he did , or you might think he embraced life . he did do some dangerous things , that's for sure . i liked the folk music soundtrack , and i thought he voice over narration from Jena Malone ( as his sister ) very effective . i didn't like the preachiness of the movie . and i also thought at 148 minutes it was too long . it's not what i would call fast paced . i also found it a bit depressing at times . generally though i found it interesting enough . for me , Into The Wild is a
473391	11423174	43959	7.0	pretty good western	i thought this was a pretty good western . it contains most of the elements western contain , stagecoaches , robbers , and gunfights . and , there is the beautiful woman ( Susan Hayward ) and the man ( Tyrone power ) she is unwittingly thrown together with in a fight to survive . there is not a lot of action , in this particular western , but that's OK . the dramatic parts are well done , and the acting is very good . Power and Hayward acquit themselves quite well do quite well here , but Hugh Marlowe is really good as the chief Villain . Dean Jagger , Jack Elam and George Tobias also play villains with Jack Elam very strong here . there is some great chemistry / tension between Power and Hayward . as most western go this one follows the formula , so it's fairly easy to predict how thing will go . i will say , though , that the ending went a bit different than i had expected . overall , an enjoyable 86 minutes or so
473724	11423174	97674	7.0	one of Pixar's early efforts	i thought this early animated short from Pixar was quite good . it's funny and ironic , plus it has a very catchy and infectious tune . it's also very low key , and movies at a nice sedate pace , which i liked a lot . it's from 1989 , so it's a lot different than the animated films we have today . it's a very simple short with a simple story . considering it is nearly 20 years old , it's actually very well done . it's also much more clever than many animated shorts from today , and certainly back then . i'd check it out if you have the chance . you might be surprised at how much you enjoy it . or you might not be . either way , it's not like you're losing a couple of hours . for me , Knick Knack is a
473887	11423174	299172	7.0	traditional style animation from Disney	this animated movie is actually pretty entertaining . there's an abundance of action , a good villain , and a couple of very funny scenes . the movie is sort of a cartoon western , done in the traditional animation style . there is lots to keep the viewer entertained . kids should like it , and adults will probably enjoy it as well . the good thing about this movie is it has a good story , and is well paced . there are even some musical numbers , ( of course this is not surprising , since most Disney movies do contain a musical element ) for people who might like musicals . " Home on the Range has something for everyone , although some of the action might be a bit intense for very young children . otherwise , a very good effort from Disney .
472799	11423174	283974	7.0	a bit better than the 1st one	as a sequel , this is not a bad movie . i actually liked it better than the 1st one . i found it more entertaining . it seemed like it was shot documentary style . at first this bothered me , as i thought it just looked too low budget . but it grew on me , and it made the movie seem more authentic . this movie has more dry one liners than the original , which is a good thing , in my opinion . i do think at times they went a bit over the top with some of the scenes and the characters . it almost becomes a parody of itself , which may be the point . this movie at least has some suspense , which the 1st one did not have , in my view . it has some of the same great music from the original , which is great . the acting again was pretty decent for the most part , though like i said , some of it seemed over the top . i also felt that the movie loses a lot of momentum towards the end and there are a few minutes which seem really slow and just don't seem to flow , like the rest of the movie . overall , though , i thought this was a pretty sequel . my rating for " Return to Cabin by the Lake " is
473333	11423174	83943	7.0	entertaining and tension filled	this was a pretty entertaining movie . i thought it was well paced , even the dramatic scenes . it's set during the cold war , when The Soviet Union and the U . S had high tensions between them . Clint Eastwood is good as a former American fighter pilot who still has flashbacks from Vietnam and hasn't flown for years . he is enlisted to steal a state of the art Russian jet so the U . S . can study its capabilities and make sure they don't fall behind in their Technology . Eastwood is good as the hero , and he also directed the picture . there's some great tension and suspenseful moments here . the flying sequences were really good at times . at other times , they are dated and don't look very realistic . still , the movie is fun , and i like the story . for me , Firefox is a
473845	11423174	237534	7.0	unseen beast goes on killing spree in 1776 France ( the story may have a kernel or two of truth to it )	this movie may or may not have been inspired by real events . if it was , i'm sure a lot was changed for dramatic effect . it take place in France during the reign of King Louis XV in 1776 . it chronicles the hunt for a an unseen and unknown beast that has responsible for many deaths and has paralyzed the citizens with fear . two men with special talent are dispatched to find and destroy the monster . i won't give any more away plot wise . however , i will say , this is not a horror movie . that is , it's not really scary . there is a definite pallor of death throughout the movie . there is some suspense of sorts in the movie and fair amount of action , with some great fight scenes . the film also has it's lighter moments , with some amusing scenes . one knock i have against this movie , is that the beast is not what you might think . in fact it is kind of a disappointment when it is revealed . however , i do like the reason given for the killing rampage . i thought it was kind of unique . the movie is a France / Canada production , so you can watch it with English subtitles , or you can watch the dubbed version . i watched the dubbed version and was very impressed with the quality of that aspect . the dubbing is very good . as for the movie itself , it clocks in at 162 minutes , but i never found it boring . for me , " Pacte des loups , Le " , AKA " Brotherhood of the Wolf " is a
473842	11423174	120742	7.0	the best of the trilogy	in my opinion this is the best of the trilogy . i laughed out loud a few times in this one . but more than that , i just thought the story was better . there were some great lines delivered in this one , many courtesy of Bob Uecker , who played Harry Doyle , the goof ball play by play man . again there are some oddball characters with some strange rituals . i also thought the movie flowed more smoothly and it was better paced . there was also a love interest for one of the characters in this one , although admit it wasn't a substantial part of the movie . but at least there was one . as far as i can recall , there was no love interest of any consequence in the previous two . if i'm wrong , please tell me so . anyway , overall a pretty good movie . for me , " Major League 3 : Back to the Minors " is a
472811	11423174	122151	7.0	Mel Gibson , Danny GloverJoe Pesci , Rene Russo , Chris Rock , and Jet Li	out of all four movies in the series , this is probably the loudest and most chaotic , but that doesn't mean it was a bad movie . i think the storyline was a bit thin and not really all that original , but just like in part three , the action , and the chemistry of the stars makes up for that . and this movie also has more laughs than the previous installments , many courtesy of both Joe Pesci and Chris Rock . Rene Russo is back , along with Mel and Danny . Jet Li joins the proceedings in this one , and brings some spectacular fight scenes courtesy of his martial arts skill . i don't know if this is the best of the series , but i thought it was as good as number three , which i really liked . for me , Lethal Weapon 4 is a
473137	11423174	380066	7.0	a solid entry in the horror genre	The Woods is a solid , eerily effective ghost story , it boasts very good acting , a decent plot and a good setting . there are some special effects , but not as much as you would expect , which is a refreshing change for this genre . this is not a slasher flick . the movie is very character driven , and so is very dramatic , and is a bit slow at times , but not enough to lose interest . the only weak spot is near the end of the movie , but i won't give it away . the movie relies more on suspense and psychological scares than gore , another positive . this is not the best movie of the genre , but it is certainly on of the better . for those who like a little gore in their movies , it may not be your cup of tea . but then again , this is a different type of movie which doesn't require gore to tell its story . all in all a good offering . A strong out of 10
473054	11423174	313443	7.0	pretty good , if unoriginal	for this genre ( crime drama / thriller ) this movie is pretty good . it's certainly entertaining and thrilling . it's also pretty fast paced . the acting is decent but not spectacular . Denzel Washington plays the main character , and he has been better . Eva Mendes is also in the movie , and depending on your taste in women , may be reason enough to watch the movie . though the movie is of a serious nature it still comes off as a fluff piece . it isn't really original for the genre . there are a few twists and turns , for sure , but many movies of the genre have those . you probably won't be fooled too much , since most of the film is predictable . still , it's fun getting there . for me , Out of Time is a
473674	11423174	116705	8.0	great fun	i truly fail to see how this movie has such a low rating ( ) on this site . i mean not only is it funny , but it's action packed , and family friendly . this is one fast paced movie , that doesn't let up . it's a true comedy of errors . the acting is also great in this one Schwarzenegger is in great comedic form here , as is Sinbad . i don't usually find Sinbad funny , but he was in this movie . and Arnie has shown his comedic side in a few movies , but i never expected him to be this funny in a comedy that fires on all cylinders . the only negative thing i would say about this movie is that it strays a bit into sappy territory briefly . there are a few suggestive scenes , but these would be above the heads of most kids , so like i said , this is a family friendly movie . there are some very funny moments throughout , and the movie is always entertaining . for me , Jingle All the way is an
473511	11423174	97659	8.0	the movie is pretty good , the songs are crap	" kickboxer " is one of Jean Claude Van Damme's earlier and better efforts . for a fan of the martial arts , it should satisfy . there aren't a lot of fight scenes , but what there is - - is pretty good . there is however , complaint i do have with this movie , and it's not so much the movie itself . it's the sht songs in it . once again , we have bad songs by a band that wouldn't rate in the worst fleabag bar . if you can't have decent music ( and i use that word very loosely ) , don't have any music at all . i did like the training montages . i thought they were kind of cool to watch , although they are pretty much the same as in " Bloodsport " , a previous Van Damme Vehicle . i don't think this movie is as good as " Bloodsport " , but it is still entertaining . for me , " Kickboxer is a
473839	11423174	118661	8.0	what is so bad about this movie ? c'mon people	i fail to see what was so wrong about this movie . the low rating ( on this site ) doesn't do it justice . i know the studio did little or no advance viewings or promotion . i'm guessing people jumped on the bandwagon , making sure they slammed it in earshot of every one they knew , before even seeing . trust me , there's a lot worse movies out there than this , many of which should never have been made , let alone released . this movie had action , some romance , some humour and excitement yes this is not Sean Connery's finest hour as he is way over the top . and yes , there are a couple of pretty absurd scenes . but honestly , it's not that bad a movie . i was very entertained . Uma Thurman was in it , for crying out loud . and in a skintight black leather outfit . what more do you need ? OK , that last part would appeal mostly to guys , but still . i am definitely bucking a trend here and giving " The Avengers " an
472890	11423174	357507	8.0	better than average for the genre	this movie is similar plot wise to two other films in the genre . very similar to 2003's Darkness Falls and to a lesser extent 2002's They . however , i felt that Boogeyman had a well developed back story , which the other are lacking , in my opinion . i also felt there was more depth to this story and a dark sinister feel . there are seems to me to be a subplot which suggests there's more going on . but i could be out to lunch here . it wouldn't be the first time . i found the creature was much more evil by what's implied , more than what's shown . i sorta wish they had developed this area even a bit more . but at least they give subtle clues to the monster's origin . as for the ending , i thought it was decent enough for the genre , although nothing is really resolved . but i thought there were other reasons this film works . the first is the casting of Emily Deschanel , who plays the role of Kate , former childhood friend of Tim , the lead character . i felt she really had some screen presence presence , plus some good emotional depth and range . i realize this genre of film isn't the best indicator of acting ability , but i noticed it anyway another reason i thought this movie stood out is the performance of young Skye McCole Bartusiak . i will refer to her simply as Skye from hereon due to her long name . Skye plays a pivotal role in the film , which i will not give away . the astonishing thing about her performance is her young age . i thought she had great depth and range for someone so young . n my mind , the film is elevated by these two performances . as an aside , Emily can now be seen in the forensic themed TV show Bones as one of the the lead characters . any way back to the movie . my overall overall impression is that the movie is better than average for its genre-very spooky at times to-be sure . and even without some great acting , i think this is still an effective movie . anyway , for me , this movie is much more than a standard horror film . but that's just me . i think Boogeyman is a
473311	11423174	43456	8.0	an important movie with a message	though this movie was released in 1951 , it's just as relevant today as it was then . it's about an alien who lands on earth , for reasons unknown at first . it shows the army and people in general panicking and acting stupid without knowing all the facts . but it's really a moral about how stupid humanity is , with our wars , ' our petty squabbles , killing each other , and probably eventually leading to the destruction of the human race . we haven't learned anything since then . in fact , we've become worse . the other ridiculous thing is that if a an alien being or alien beings did travel to earth , from a far planet , they would obviously be technologically advanced , yet , as the movie depicts , we would use our primitive technology to shoot first , and ask questions later . i have no doubt this would be the same in real life , considering how arrogant we are as a race . anyway , i liked the movie , and it's positive message . it doesn't try to utilize special effects that seem would eventually become dated and hokey . in fact , the use of special effects is limited . instead it focuses more on story . it's actually , i think , a very important movie . for me , The day the Earth Stood Still is a solid
473179	11423174	212985	8.0	Part three in the Hannibal Lecter series ( beautifully stylistic but less substance )	" Hannibal " is directed by Ridley Scott . it takes place after the events in the Silence of the Lambs . Here we have the great Anthony Hopkins reprising his Role as Hannibal Lecter , serial killer and one time psychiatrist . and Jullianne Moore takes over as FBI agent Clarice Starling . in this movie Hannibal comes out of hiding to bait Clarice . The movie starts in Florence Italy , where Lecter has been living in disguise as an art scholar . however events force him back to America . once there , he of course baits agent Starling and he himself becomes the focus of revenge by a former patient who barley escaped being killed by Lecter . Gary Oldman plays the former patient . the movie is very stylish with beautiful photography and scenery , especially in Italy . we are shown the old buildings with their impressive architecture . the movie is very well lit , giving the perfect atmosphere . the movie on the whole focuses more on style than substance and the fact that Lecter comes out of hiding takes away the air of mystery the film could have had . so , the film while beautiful to look at , seems hollow at times and incomplete . it can also be slow and overly dramatic at times , lacking the pace of the previous incarnations . Lecter is also played more for camp in this film , with his witty one liners . he just doesn't seem as frightening here . The acting is very good in the movie , especially by Moore , who inhabits the character of Starling with the same affectations mannerisms and accent as her predecessor , Jodi Foster . despite it's failings , i still enjoyed the movie - more so than " silence " but less so than " RedDragon Or " Manhunter " . i would have to give this movie an , for its beautiful style and the acting of Jullianne Moore .
473905	11423174	804461	8.0	unrated version	this movie is basically Death Wish updated for the year 2007 . there are a few differences , but the overall plot is the same . it's a revenge / drama . action / movie . it's not realistic , but it sure has lots of action , and lots of blood . this a a very violent film throughout . there's also quite a few strong swear words . one thing i did like about the movie was it's unconventional ending . i also liked the acting , particularly by Garret Hedlund , who plays the main bad guy . John Goodman has a small and needless role . he has one ridiculous scene where he goes off on a profanity laced tirade . Kelly Preston has a small role as the wife of Kevin Bacon's character . and Kevin bacon is the main character , who decides to get revenge for a tragedy that occurs against him and his family . but i really liked Aisha Tyler , who has a small but memorable role in the movie . Brian Garfield wrote the novel that is the basis for the movie , and he also wrote the novel Death Wish , so it's no surprise the two movies are very similar . i recently saw The Brave One , another revenge thriller , starring Jodi Foster , which i like more than this movie . i felt it had more depth to it and stronger acting performances . still , i did like Death Sentence . for me , this movie gets an
473246	11423174	297884	8.0	very well done but should have been rated 14A ( in my opinion )	in this film which takes place in the 1950's , Dennis Quaid and Julianne Moore play your typical happily married couple . and then change . the film is about the intolerance and ignorance of the time , and also the hypocrisy in people's attitudes . Both Moore and Quaid are pitch perfect in their characterizations , and Dennis Haysbert is very good as , well . there are some very touching moments here . this is no film for children . it is rated PG , which i don't happen to agree with . obviously it contains dark themes and implication , so i wouldn't suggest anyone under 14 view it . maybe i'm just becoming a prude in my old age . in any event , the film is very well done , from the acting , to the dialogue , to the authentic feel . for me , Far From heaven is an
473050	11423174	338526	8.0	one wild ride	i don't understand the low rating for ( ) for this movie on this site . i thoroughly enjoyed myself throughout . the basic Gist of the story is this : Van Helsing take son Count Dracula , The Wolfman , and the Frankenstein Monster in one adventure . what more could you ask for ? this is one fast paced thrill ride , with spectacular action and fight sequences . Hugh Jackman is Van Helsing , and makes the character larger than life . Kate Beckinsale is Anna Valerious , whose family has for centuries tried to rid the world of evil . she teams up with Van Helsing , and the sparks fly . there is no denying the chemistry between the two . i wouldn't call this a scary movie , but it is very intense at times , and a bit morbid . it doesn't take itself seriously though , which works in this case . for me , Van Helsing is an
473642	11423174	55254	8.0	fun for the whole family	i really enjoyed this animated Disney classic . it's just a lot of fun . lots of action and excitement , and an excellent choice for the villain in Cruella Devil . whose is iconic ( or should be ) in my opinion . very young children may be a bit frightened of her , as she certainly is scary looking . her 2 henchman are quite inept , and provide a lot of comic relief . i also really liked the voice acting . i thought it fit well with the characters . the animation is also good , considering it is from 1961 , though i'm sure it took a few years before that to complete . anyway , in my opinion , this classic is good fun for the whole family . my vote for 101 Dalmatians is an
473484	11423174	463944	8.0	very good morality tale	i liked this movie . it's a movie about football , but it's much more than that . it's really about honor , truth , and loyalty . it is set in 1950 , and chronicles the " Army " - the West Point football team . West point is the very esteemed military academy . as the movie begins , " army is coming off of 27 consecutive wins and hope to win the championship once again . along the way , many on the team will go through some trials that will test their morality and pledge to uphold the principle of honor at any cost . the backdrop to the story is the Korean War . i like the fact the the story has some depth to it . the very fine performances go along way in anchoring the story . Scott Glenn gives a nice understated , quietly intense performance as one of of the coaches . even though this is a morality tale , it doesn't hit you over the head , or preach to you . all in all a pretty good movie . for me " Code Breakers " is an
472602	11423174	92007	8.0	great fun ( not your conventional StarTrek movie )	i enjoyed this installment of the Star Trek franchise quite a bit . in my opinion , it's better than the previous ones . i think they did a very good job here , balancing many different elements . there is certainly the action / adventure element here but there is also so quite a bit of humour . the writing is very intelligent and witty . there is also the element of danger , which is very real in this one . the threat is very grave and imminent . the suspense factor is high here too . the story itself is very well written and well paced . this is almost a comedy at its heart . the dialogue is very sharp and fresh . it's more of a family movie than the previous ones . there is some mild language , but it is not used maliciously . it does actually serve the story . the movie is also a cautionary tale i think , to humanity . i think it's just as relevant today as it was then , maybe more so . generally , this movie is probably the most fun of the original Star Trek movies , in terms of comedic value . i also think it is probably the best of the original movies . for me , Star Trek 4 : The Voyage Home is a definite .
472671	11423174	71771	8.0	comedy , drama , and action	Burt Reynolds Plays Paul Crewe , a former pro quarterback , whose life takes a turn for the worse as he find himself in jail . The warden ( Eddie Albert ) has a sadistic mean streak . he petitions Crewe to form a football team from the inmates to play against the guards ( a semi pro team ) in four weeks as a warm up match before the semi pro season begins . the warden assumes an easy brutal victory against the inmates . But Crewe and his ragtag bunch have other ideas . this movie has everything , lots of one liners , some very funny situations . even some drama , and action . oh , yeah , there's football too . i would classify this movie as as dramedy , a drama / comedy hybrid , with some action . i laughed quite a bit . the football scenes , especially the hits , are very authentic and there is a lot of violence , though nothing very graphic . overall , the Longest Yard is a very good movie , that is more than a football movie . even if you don't like football , you should still enjoy this film . a strong
473348	11423174	259324	8.0	Ghost Rider makes the leap from comic book to screen	as far as comic book adaptations go , this is not a bad movie , i can't say how accurate it is to its source material , but i didn't mind it . it's basically about a young motorcycle stuntman named Johnny Blaze . as a young man . johnny is tricked into selling his soul to the devil for reasons revealed in the movie . years later , the devil calls upon his services as " Ghost Rider " a flame skulled entity from the dark side who is basically the devil's bounty hunter . i liked this movie quite a bit , although it seemed a bit rushed . i think they could have fleshed it out a bit more . but to be fair , there is some voice over narration in the film , which does provide an overview of the whole Ghost Rider Legend . if you're a fan of the comic , you probably know all you need to know . Nic Cage , as the older Johnny Blaze / Ghost Rider is well cast . he seems to suit the role well and is believable ( in the context of the movie ) . i like the music . it went well with the movie . there is a lot of action in the movie and some cgi , which is well done , but not groundbreaking or anything . ( although Ghost Rider's flaming skull was kinda cool ) The beautiful and talented Eva Mendes plays the love interest , but her screen time is far too short . her character should have had more to do . she is very charismatic , so the scenes she was in left me wanting more . oh , well , hopefully her character will play a larger role in the sequel . as for the movie itself , my friend and i had free passes , so i can't really complain . it is a fun movie to watch , but doesn't linger long after viewing . i will go see the sequel when it comes out , as i believe it will probably improve on this one .
473583	11423174	29606	8.0	what price , fame ?	this is the first version of this movie made , and the only version i have seen so far . i liked it . i thought it was touching and ironic , and also tragic . it basically tells what the movie business can do to you , and the sacrifices that are made . it also shows how disposable the industry and the people in it are . as long as you are the flavour of the week , everything seems fine . but when you're no longer useful , reality hits and things can come crashing down . that's what basically happens in this story . it's an indictment ( ironically ) of the movie industry , however subtle . regardless , i thought it was well done . the acting by the tow leads , Janet Gaynor , and Frederic March , as well as the supporting performances , are terrific . i also thought the writing was very good , and the movie flows very well . for me , A Star is Born gets an
473186	11423174	187738	8.0	worthy follow up to the original	" Blade 2 " is obviously the sequel to the original . David S Goyer once again wrote the script , based on characters created for Marvel Comics by Marv Wolfman and Gene Colan . Guillermo del Torro takes over the directing reigns from Stephen Norrington . the storyline this time around is more complex than the original . the original had a pretty basic storyline , which is fine for Blade's introduction . now that Blade's character has been somewhat fleshed out , a stronger storyline has to be established . so there is an interesting twist in this film . the stronger story makes the movie more dramatic , so there are less action sequences . the story is slower of course , but it is worth it . a more human sensitive side of blade is revealed . there are still plenty of action scenes , many of which are more spectacular this time around . Wesley Snipes reprises his role of " Blade " , naturally and Snipes really gets to show of his fighting prowess and athleticism in this installment . the direction is as good as the original , though it has its own style . the special effects are improved here , and the tone of the film is darker in generally but there are little touches of mild humour added . the music is again well suited to the movie . overall , a good followup film . a solid
472955	11423174	114167	8.0	a very entertaining story of possession , which does not follow the usual formula	i really enjoyed this movie . it's a movie about a man who , becomes possessed by an evil spirit . at the beginning we are told it is based on factual events , which is possible , but there's no way to verify that claim . for a made for TV , this 1 is quite well done . i think a big part of the reason for this is that the movie focuses more on the acting than than on big budget , bombastic special effects . the effects are low key , but well done . the movie also dwells on the psychological aspects of someone being posses and how they deal with it . the acting is very convincing , more so than in many movies of the genre , made for TV or not . i also like that you don't know the reason for the possession , and when the reason is revealed , it's somewhat surprising ( at least for me , it was ) the movie doesn't take the usual rouete travelled by most in the genre , which is refreshing . all in all , a very entertaining suspenseful , well acted movie . my vote : a strong
473859	11423174	289765	8.0	way above average thriller	i liked " red dragon " a lot . it was was well written and well directed . the acting was very good , in particular harvey keitel , in a small role . the action scenes were well done and the characters were sympathetic , so you felt their pain and anguish . the dramatic scenes were done to great effect , not simply filler , but actually serving a purpose . there was also plenty of suspense , excellent in this case , since the movie take place before the events in " the silence of the lambs " do . even though you know the story , the director still manages to keep you on edge and keep you interested in the story . i found the dialogue refreshing , not clichéd and awkward , as is the case quite often . i bought " red dragon and have watched it more than once , enjoying it each time . if this is your type of genre , you will like this movie
472589	11423174	91209	9.0	classic horror suspense that stands up well over 20 years later	i thought this was a very good movie . it had action and suspense . it was very intense in some scenes . i also thought Rutger Hauer was very convincing as a psycho , while C . Thomas Howell is good as the hero . Jennifer Jason Leigh is also good in a supporting role . there is also a very inventive and nail biting torture scene that doesn't end the way you might think . another thing i really liked was the fact that many things are implied , but not shown , adding another dimension to the movie . this movie certainly had me on the edge of my seat a lot . to me , " The Hitcher is a classic , and still stands up well today . i'ts low budget , but effective . i give this movie
472751	11423174	460681	9.0	equal parts Buffy , Charmed and X-files , . . .	which in this case , is a good thing . this show just keeps getting better and better each episode . if that trend continues , Supernatural should be on the air for years to come . not only are the stories compelling , but the acting is first rate thanks to Jared Padalecki and Jenson Ackles , who play brothers Sam and Dean Winchester . their characters are also well developed and very sympathetic . the writing is also very strong , with some very good dialogue , including some decent humorous moments to lighten the mood , as the show is very dark . if you're a fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Charmed , and / or X-files , you should like this show , as it is a mix of those three shows . for me , Supernatural is a
472756	11423174	72308	9.0	great disaster movie !	i think this disaster movie may be greater than The Poseidon Adventure , which is also a very good movie . the title pretty much speaks for itself . this was certainly a grand undertaking , i think more ambitious than The Poseidon Adventure . i found it actually more exciting and compelling . it's pretty fast paced . it also looks pretty realistic from the effects standpoint , whatever they had at the time . there are a huge number of big stars of the day in this one . but the real star of the movie is the building and the fire . there are plenty of explosions but the last big explosive sequence was particularly impressive and must have been no small feat to pull off . there's only thing i didn't like about this film , and this is just a minor quibble . i didn't think the theme sing ( sung near the beginning of the movie ) really fit into the movie . it just seemed out of place . but that isn't enough to detract from the rest of the movie . for me , The Towering Inferno is a
473765	11423174	102585	9.0	4th entry in the Omen Series near comparable to the original	Whew . i just finished watching " The Omen 4 : The Awakening . i know many people think it is nothing more than an inferior made for cable piece of crap . i disagree . for my money , this movie is nearly on par with the original . there are some terrifying moments that got my heart racing . the acting was very good . Faye Grant is terrific as the mother of the evil child Delia ( Asia Viera ) . Micheal Woods plays the father and husband and is one of the weak spots in this movie . although to be fair , his character is really peripheral , so the blame cannot lie totally with him . However , it is Asia Viera who plays Delia who is the true standout . she can convey evil with just a look . she is very charismatic , and dare i say , has the same natural ability of Harvey Stevens , who plays the role of childhood Damien in the original . the story is quite similar to the original . congressman Gene York and his wife Karen end up adopting a baby girl at an orphanage and of course very little is known of the biological parents . Strange occurrences begin to happen . people die mysterious deaths . Karen begins to suspect there is something horribly wrong about the child . there is an interesting twist to the story which i thought was very inventive . music is used to great effect in this movie , some of it borrowed from the original movie . i also have to say that the production values are very high for this film . of course , the violence of the deaths is toned down abit , but this movie doesn't rely on cheap gore , but on suspense . besides , the original did not rely on violence either . One issue i do have is that the ending was a cop out , and didn't seem plausible . it just didn't fit . changing gears for a second , i have to wonder why Faye Grant is not a huge Hollywood star on the big screen . perhaps ii is by choice . She is a fine actress , as good as or better than many of the so called actresses we have today . anyway . this movie should give you some genuine chills .
472610	11423174	70078	9.0	" the love of money is the root of all evil "	if you like anthology collections like Tales From the Crypt and Creepshow , you should like this movie . i think it's better than both . basically it's five separate stories dealing with the occult . all five stories though separate , begin with an antique shop which hold many strange items . in each story , someone comes int possession of an item thinking the cam away with bargain . but the get much more than the bargained for . this is one of the better horror anthologies i have seen . each story is genuinely eerie and suspenseful and i got shivers down my spine more than a few times . there is even a bit of humour in in of the stories . the only downside is the readily apparent low budget . still , the stories are effective enough and the acting superb . so the low budget isn't really a a huge problem . for me , From Beyond the grave is an
473445	11423174	76759	9.0	the landmark space fantasy	what can you say about his movie . it set the bar by which all movies to come would be judged , and this was 1977 . i'm talking about the visual effects , which were nothing less than astounding . it still stands up well to any movie in that regard . remember , they didn't have the benefit of CGI back then , so they relied on miniatures . when you add to that , a compelling story and a soon to be iconic villain ( not to mention , the colourful cast of characters ) and you have box office gold . sure , the dialogue may be wooden and stilted at times , but that is overshadowed by the achievement of the film . Besides , the film was marketed at 12 year olds , so they're not gonna care about stupid things like dialogue . The original " Star Wars " or as it is subtitled " a New Hope , was a landmark film and single handedly reinvented the science fiction genre . Obviously
473245	11423174	33457	9.0	what a gas !	what a riot this film is , once it gets going . the first 30 minutes are just the setup . from that point on , it's gas . Benny is hysterical in drag . i laughed my but off at his hi-jinks . i even had tears in my eyes at times . this is surely a classic . if not , it should be . Jack Benny of course takes centre stage here , but the supporting performances are very good , as well . it's based on a very successful stage play , but it translates well to the screen . it's also been made into a movie at least once before . if you're a Jack Benny fan , you can't afford to miss this gem . even if you're not a fan of Jack Benny , or don't even know who he is , you should catch this film for the great writing and the slapstick . and it's a good introduction to Benny . for me , Charley's Aunt is a
473071	11423174	87078	9.0	even better than the original ( despite the casting blunder of Grace Jones ) shudder	this sequel to " Conan The Barbarian " is a pretty decent movie , in my mind . it has as much action as the first one , but the story is better in my opinion . it is a bit hard to follow . at least i thought it was . the tone of the movie seems lighter than the first , and there is more humour . i also liked the fact the " Conan " was shown as being human , and not invincible . i thought his main adversary was a great choice for the strength of Conan and he could not beat it by brawn alone . there are also some great characters for Conan's traveling companions , who actually were very helpful to Conan . the one thing i did not like is the inclusion of Grace Jones . to me , the woman is much too scary to be on any screen or even seen by the public . i thought she added nothing to the movie and her role was pointless . she also scares the sht out of me . however , i thought the movie was good enough to overcome that huge casting blunder . in fact , in spite of that fact , in my opinion " Conan The Destroyer " manages to be a better movie than the first Conan movie . this is just my opinion of course . For me , " Conan The Destroyer " is an
473667	11423174	404032	9.0	Jennifer Carpenter ( as Emily ) is astonishing	this movie definitely has some blood curdling moments . the story is basically this : a catholic priest is on trial for causing the death of a young girl eh performed an exorcism on , claiming she was possessed . however , the authorities believe he caused her death . through flashbacks , we see the events leading up to that point , including the possession of Emily Rose ( Jeniffer Carpenter ) . Laura Linney is the Lawyer who takes on the case . Tom Wilkinson is the priest . and Campbell Scott is the prosecuting attorney . but there's more than this to the story . the movie has some similarities to An American Haunting , which came out the same year . this movie has a better , more developed story though , and the acting is better . Jeniffer Carpenter in particular , is astonishing . for me , The Excorism of Emily Rose is a
472598	11423174	117731	9.0	awesome ! ! !	for my money , this eight movie in the Star Trek franchise is the best of the eight . i just think it's got a great story , with a good subplot . the acting is good . the action sequences are really good . i also really like the look of the Enterprise in this movie . it so sleek and beautiful . also , the villain is quite strong , a worthy adversary for the Enterprise and her crew . there's also some humour here , which is always nice and some character growth and development . this is the first of The Next Generation movies and it is awesome . actually this movie blew me away with how good it is . there are also a boat load of extras on this second disc which make this edition more than the worth the purchase price , in my mind . easily
473210	11423174	443543	9.0	romance , mystery , suspense all add up to a very good movie	i liked this movie a lot . i thought the acting was very good . Jessica Biel really impressed me in her role . she really brought some depth to her character , and proved that she definitely has talent . she held her own against some real heavyweights in the film . i also liked the setting of Vienna sometime in the 19th century , i believe . i think Vienna is really appropriate , because , to me it seems like it would be a romantic city . the movie has a romantic air to it , but it is also a mystery / suspense film . i thought the story was also very good , and well told . the characters had some dimension to them , at least i think they did . i liked the ending , even though it was anti-climatic . it fit with the rest of the movie . by that i mean it all makes sense at the end , but you have to think about it a bit . if you enjoy movies that are challenging , and if you are a bit of a romantic , ( even if you're not ) you will probably like " The Illusionist " . for me , this movie is about
472770	11423174	476964	9.0	Terrific performances from Jodi Foster and Terrence Howard	this movie was much better than i had hoped or expected it to be . it basically turns the vigilante genre on its head , and has a female character as the vigilante . like any vigilante movie , it certainly poses tough questions . it contains some terrific performances in it's two lead characters , Jodi Foster as the vigilante , and Terrance Howard as the cop on her trail . both are outstanding and very credible in their respective roles . Foster really makes you sympathetic to her character and rooting for her , even though you probably shouldn't . Howard's character is also sympathetic , because he has mixed feelings , but has to follow the law . he comes off very convincingly as someone who is conflicted . the movie is well paced and appropriately dark . even before the end of the movie , i thought it was well done , but the ending caught me totally off guard . it elevated the movie a notch . for me , The Brave One is a
473314	11423174	89886	10.0	awesome	this film is awesome . i loved it . it's only Val Kilmer's second feature film , the first being Top Secret a year earlier . basically , it all about a college full of misfit geniuses and the mischief they get into , since most of them don't have to study . there are some very quirky characters , and some pretty funny pranks . but it's not all fun and games . possible spoilerthe students actually end up foiling a top secret military plot as well . end of spoilerfor sheer zaniness , it's hard to beat this film . the music , especially by Tears for Fears took me back . if you're looking for high art , this movie is far from it . but , if you just wanna sit back , turn your bairn off , and have some fun , this could be you movie . for me , it's a perfect
473681	11423174	103064	10.0	" I know now why you cry , but it's something i cannot do "	as good as the first terminator movie is , this one is better . it's got harrowing action sequences , quite a bit of humour , and more character development . it's not as dark as the first one . instead it has more of hopeful tone . it has strong message too , that is becoming more and more relevant each passing day Arnie is back , but this time his terminator is has more dimensions to his personality . Joe Morton , a terrific ( though underrated ) actor also plays a prominent role , and is also terrific . Linda Hamilton returns and her character is much more defined and has more to do . she is certainly up to the task . but really , the ( human ) star of the movie has to be Robert Patrick in what i think was a career making performance . the guy is just amazing . the biggest star of all in this movie would have to be the special effects . they were beyond cutting edge then , and they still stand the test of time today . for me this movie is definitely in my top 10 movies of all time . my vote for Terminator 2 : Judgment Day is a perfect .
473033	11423174	56592	10.0	classic with Gregory Peck	this is an outstanding film . it deals with the subject of hate and ignorance , and basically tells us we should all treat each other with respect and caring . the dialogue is very well written and the characters are all interesting . Gregory Peck gives a brilliant understated performance as a humble small town lawyer who tries to teach his children the same morals and values he has . he ends up taking a very unpopular court case , and his resolve is tested . the movie has a voice over narration by the adult version of one of the children , and i found it very effective . not everyone will like , this movie . it movies a a sedate pace , and some will find that boring . but if you do watch it to the end , you will probably be moved by it . i know i was . my vote for To Kill A Mockingbird is a
473700	11423174	238784	10.0	in a very close race for best show on TV	Earlier on , in a review of CSI : Las Vegas , i wrote that CSI may be possibly be the best show on the air . the only other show which might ( i mean might ) be better is the Gilmor Girls . Now it isn't really fair to compare the 2 shows , since they are not the same genre . CSI is a forensic crime drama , which does employ dark humour at times . Gilmor Girls is a drama / comedy , but it uses wit and sarcasm as humour quite often . so really the are not similar at all . if you are not familiar with the show it goes like this : Lorelai Gilmor ( Lauren Graham ) and her teenage daughter Rory ( Alexis Bledel ) cope with life in the small town of Stars Hollow . i say cope because they live in a town with some very eccentric , some say odd characters . and there are a few that may just be nuts . in addition to having to deal with the townsfolk , both also have to contend with Lorelai's overbearing mother and distant Father , who live outside of town , but for reasons i won't reveal here , they must spend more time than they want to with them . Or rather , Loralie must spend more time than she wants to . there is more to the story than this , but i don't want to give it away , for someone who has not seen the show . The show was created by Amy Sherman , who with her husband Daniel also wrote several of the episodes up to and including season six . this show is amazingly well written , the dialogue is truly magnificent . one of the signature devices in the show is the rapid fire , back and forth banter between Lorelai and Rory , and the way the communicate with other people . the show , aside from being witty and sarcastic , is also very edgy . it deals with some vary serious adult issues at times , and is sometimes heartbreaking . The other thing Gilmor Girls is known for is it's pop culture references . each episode is peppered with them , some of them obscure . if you're not paying attention , you will miss a lot of them , as they are usually referenced machine gun style , almost as an aside . anyway , the show started off brilliantly and has remained so . this isn't just a chick show , despite what you may think . Guys will love it too , though some may not readily admit it . if you haven't seen it , you should start by picking up season 1 , since the storyline has progressed from each episode . what else can i say except , awesome , awesome , awesome .
473147	11423174	477348	10.0	well told story	i've seen a few of the Coen Brothers movies , and didn't really like most of them . i just thought they were too weird . but this one's different . it seems more based in reality . these characters could exist and their actions are plausible . i also thought the characters were well defined within the confines of the movie . this is a dark movie , for sure . the story is set in 1980 , and is more or less told from the point of view of the local sheriff and his perspective on the changing times and the new breed of criminal . this is a crime drama , but it's also a western of sorts . it's violent , but not as much as many other movies . this is a character and dialogue driven movie . i thought it was well done . it's not an action packed movie . in fact , it may seem a bit slow at times but the story is told well enough , and the characters are interesting and engaging enough that it never becomes boring . in fact , i found it very compelling . i liked everything about this movie . No country for Old Men is a
473572	11423174	187393	10.0	astounding in every way ( be warned though , it is brutally violent and bloody )	i thought this movie was absolutely brilliant . it's set during the time of the American revolution . Benjamin Martin ( Mel Gibson ) is a simple farmer who does not want to get involved , as he doesn't believe in war . in short , he's a pacifist . that it , until one day a sadistic act of violence is perpetrated against his family . Martin transforms from the meek man he once was , to a man on a mission : to get revenge against the British in general , and the one Britsh officer in particular responsible . so , he becomes the leader of the Colonials . there's a lot of great names in here , and i won't mention them all . but i will mention Jason Isaacs , brilliant as a sadistic British Colonel and Chris Cooper as an American Colonel . i mention Cooper because you are guaranteed to see great acting from him . this movie is quite bloody and brutally violent . there are no punches pulled here . if you have a weak stomach shy away from this one . otherwise , for a war themed movie , i highly recommend it . one of the greatest movies i have ever seen . 10 + + + / 10
473288	11423174	119654	10.0	one of the best sci / fi comedy movies ever made	this is a very clever and witty movie . it takes a serious subject , such as Alien Invasion and turns it on it's head . there will be a lot of laughter involved in the watching of this movie . at least there should be . the whole premise behind it is absurd , intentionally so . there's a lot of irony in this movie . Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith Play the two main Men in Black character . Jones plays agent K ( Kay ) and Smith plays Agent J ( Jay ) K is the straitlaced veteran who reluctantly trains a newcomer , Who takes the nickname or code name K ( Smith ) Jones and Smith work brilliantly together . Jones as the strait man and Smith as his comic foil . these two have some great comic chemistry . whoever had the idea to pair these two up deserves medal . i don't think they could have found two more perfectly suited actors on the planet . but amid all the hilarity , their is some serious stuff happening , and that is handled very well . even the serious scenes are played for laughs . this is in my top five in comedies . brilliant .
473835	11423174	114369	10.0	Enter the mind of a serial killer	warning : if you choose to watch this movie , know that you will enter on a dark and twisted journey . David Fincher directs this film , which concerns a serial killer who executes people , using the seven deadly sins as justification . though there are some horrific and graphic images here , there real genius of this movie is it's implied horror . this movie will leave you with an impact long after the end credits have rolled . David Fincher directs this intense psychological suspense thriller . Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play two detectives on the trail of the killer . Freeman plays veteran Detective Lt . William Somerset , on the verge of retirement , after this case . Pitt plays rookie detective Detective David Mills . Kevin Spacey also stars in a powerful performance that is mesmerizing . this is one of the best movies of this genre i have seen so far . if you are not affected by this movie , i'd be surprised . for me , Se7en is easily a
