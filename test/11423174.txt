472859	11423174	367153	1.0	unbelievably sick and awful ( in the worst way )	what a horrible , horrible movie . i thought i was watching a snuff film . you have to be emotionally unhinged to enjoy this piece of excrement . low budget and it shows . the camera lingers for a very long time on all the killing scenes , way too long . the acting is poor , the plot is ridiculous and full of inconsistencies and holes you could drive a couple of semi trucks through . but really the movie is just pointless , gratuitous gore and violence . this dog may be worse than hostel . it's definitely a close race . if you're even slightly well adjusted , you will have no use for this bomb . if you do enjoy this film , i hope i never live next door to you . i felt so dirty after watching this thing , i had to take a shower right after to cleanse myself . and i may never get the stench out of my house . truly , truly , sick and demented ( and not in any good way ) filth
472901	11423174	89629	1.0	this movie is a violation ( but my cactus liked it )	i should have known what i was getting myself into as soon as i realized some of the same people behind Police Academy , were responsible for this thing . but , i thought i'd give it a shot . turns out , all copies of this movie should be shot into outer space , where it can do no harm , at least to us earthlings . i guess if i was 12 . this movie might be funny , but i doubt it . the movie ( and i use this term loosely ) is basically about a bunch of odd characters who get sentenced to traffic school in order to get their licenses back . this movie is really bad , alright , but , believe it or not , there are much worse movies , which should also join this thing on its outer space voyage . it is awful , but there are varying degrees of awful . on the awful meter this thing ranks somewhere almost near the middle . i think my cactus liked it . i'm sure i heard it laugh a few times . as for my fellow human beings , however , if you are looking for a comedy-keep looking . a very weak
472897	11423174	97527	1.0	outdoes the previous " House " ( more often known as " The horror show " ) entry in sheer crappiness	so , on we go to round three of the " House " series . we ( my sister and i ) had watched the first entry all the way through and were underwhelmed , to say the least . the second one lowered the bar for crappiness even further . how bad could number 3 be ? it starts off promising enough . after all , it had Lance Henricksen ( he should've passed ) in it and it looked like it had a bigger budget . however , it soon became apparent that this movie was also a dud . another ridiculous plot , bad acting , bad everything . i think this one made it 40 minutes tops . any longer and my head would have exploded . again , no horror , and no comedy . i must be missing something . i wish i knew what it was . this thing gets a low note : this movie is sometimes referred to as " House 3 " including the copy i have . SO , although it may have little or nothing to do with the " House " other than name , i chose to refer to it as " House " 3 in my summary . i hope this clears up any confusion .
472942	11423174	449086	1.0	2 hours gone forever into the abyss ( which is where this movie belongs )	sometimes you go into a film with very low expectations , and occasionally you are pleasantly surprised . Dominion : Prequel to the Exorcist is not that movie . i was sure this movie would be a piece of crap , except that i would rather have watched a piece of crap for 2 hours . it would have been much more entertaining . so why did i watch it ? well , it was on cable , i had nothing better to do , and i like to give every movie the benefit of the doubt . but the most important reason i sat through this thing : i ran out of pins to stick in my eyes . there is very little good about this film , other than the end credits . Stellan Skarsgard is a very talented actor , but his talents are wasted on this dud . you expect to see a movie with a demon , based on the title . the demon only appears well after half of the movie has elapsed , and it does not inspire fear at all , but is laughable . the movie is also disjointed and has many scenes that have no relevance . then again the movie has no relevance either . it does at times become a sermon , which is very annoying . special mention must go to the people in charge of the cgi effects . they have managed to creature the worst cgi animals i have ever seen . hyenas , several cattle and even a snake were very obviously all cgi . completely fake looking . unless you want to lose 2 hours of your life , don't even go near this thing . a well deserved
473157	11423174	93777	1.0	really bad Carpenter film	Prince of Darkness is a bad movie from John Carpenter . the whole thing is ridiculous . take the premise , for example . A priest has discovered a long hidden canister containing the liquid form of Satan himself , or rather his son . said canister had been hidden deep within the basement of an ancient church . upon discovering it , said priest decides to call upon physics Prof and students to investigate it . soon , the liquid ends up in most of the students ( don't ask ) turning then into mindless drones whose only purpose is to aid the son ( said liquid ) into freeing daddy aka Satan . Anyway , the whole thing is ludicrous even for sci-fi / fantasy / horror . there just isn't any point . Carpenter really misses the mark here . With all due respect to the late , great Donald Pleasence , what was he thinking ? the only redeeming feature of this movie is that it is ( marginally ) less awful than " Slither " and " Lawnmower Man 2 " .
473227	11423174	322651	1.0	quick , over here ! . i think i've found it . . . ,	no . sorry . my mistake . i thought for a minute i may have found the plot to this movie . but i don't think think a search party could have any success finding the plot to this movie . there are a few good actors in this movie , but they can't do anything to make it better . i think the movie dragged their performances down with it . as a a result , you won't find much in the way of acting here . and the dialogue . wow . awful , truly awful . i suspect they were going for something profound here , but they fell short by a long shot . this thing is really tedious . i think this is a case where they should have scrapped this thing before it was done , or at least not released it . i don't want to say it's bad , but it sure is the opposite of good . this is how i feel about the movie , and others may feel differently . all i know is , it sure didn't do it for me . for me , Dream Warrior is a / 10 movie .
473414	11423174	267679	1.0	truly painful to watch , unless you're into unintentional bad acting	as disaster movies , this is pretty awful . poor acting all around , especially from the woman who played the town mayor . judging by her performance , i'm guessing she thought she was in a comedy . nobody did a good job in their roles , except maybe John Schnieder , who was not too bad and Michelle Greene was okay . as for the rest , there isn't a convincing one in the lot . i was so embarrassed for them all . but to be fair , some of the dialogue they were given is atrocious . not much thought went into this film . 1 positive though is that the lightning scenes were done well , and were almost impressive at times . the story itself moves way too slow , with pointless scene after pointless scene . this movie is not worth your time , unless you want to laugh at bad acting . the movie is supposed to be serious , and is not played for camp value , at all , and that is the real disaster .
473163	11423174	120804	3.0	it didn't work for me	i watched this movie a few years ago and remember liking it . but not this time . honestly , this movie is just one long bore , with a bit of action thrown in occasionally . it just doesn't work for me , plain and simple . there are two good things about it though . one is the pretty decent makeup effects , and the other is the music , kind of a techno / trance cross . otherwise , this felt like one of the longest 100 minutes of my life . to me , Doom is a better movie . it's fun and doesn't take itself seriously . Maybe Resident Evil would have been better if they had made it a bit lighter , or at least added some humour . or maybe not . but for whatever reason , i just didn't like it . for me , Resident Evil is a
472917	11423174	165662	3.0	easily the weakest of the franchise	while i actually liked the first two Candyman movies , i didn't ' like this third and ( so far Final ) installment . i found it boring and repetitive and i didn't like the story very much . there's a lot of filler here , which suggests to me that the filmmakers didn't have enough of a story for a complete movie . i also wasn't too impressed with the acting . there was a lot of overwrought theatrics . as well , there were some things in this movie that did not fit with the previous movies , basically throwing out certain aspects of the lore . maybe i'm just imagining things , but this is my opinion on things . finally , this movie has none of the style of the second movie . adding it all up , this third installment in the series is much lower in quality on all counts . my vote for Candyman 3 : Day of the dead is a
473382	11423174	190865	3.0	spectacular views and not much else of consequence	lately , it seems the last few movies i have reviewed have basically been of the wall to wall action and realty defying stunts category . the same holds true for this movie . the only difference is , most of the action and stunts happen to occur high above sea level . on mountain to be exact . i actually almost hated this movie . there's little in the way of script , but to be far they just didn't have any room for it , what with all the explosions and stunts . the one redeeming feature this movie has-is the scenery . there are very breathtaking views . but other than that , i can't muster much enthusiasm . to tell the truth , despite nothing but stunt after stunt after explosion , several yawns escaped . i was bored out of my gourd . not a good sign . but , because of the spectacular views , i'll give " Vertical " Limit "
473468	11423174	462482	4.0	very interesting premise ; script does not do it justice	this is an interesting tale as far as ghost stories go . i won't go into the plot because i don't want to give anything away . unfortunately , the premise is interesting , but the rest of the movie plods along at a snail's pace . there is next to no action . the story is very dialogue driven and not enough is done with the premise . the movie is almost incomplete in a sense because the central issue is barely explored , and very little background is given as to the reasons for the strange goings on in the town , ( true we are given some surface explanation ) at least not in depth . there really is no payoff , no climax to speak of . the movie ends as quietly as it began . the acting in the move is good , the movie is photographed well , but the script doesn't do justice to its central theme . i'd have to say Population 436 rates due to its creative though ultimately unexplored plot line .
472597	11423174	338034	4.0	too much slow drama , not enough action for my taste	i though this film was okay . i din't think it was great . it was a bit too slow for my taste . lots of drama , but not very much action until close to the end of the film . this movie was basically a dramatic film , with the payoff , if you can call it that , not until near the end . to me , the scenes of the dam bursting and the water flooding the town , were okay , but much too brief . the film itself is done okay , the acting is decent , but it just didn't do it for me , in the long run . think it had something to do with the fact that there was very little suspense or tension built through the whole movie . at least that's what i think . the other factor is that i had just recently watched ' 10 . 5 ' and its sequel ' 10 . 5 : Apocalypse ' . these are 2 big budget " event movies , which , in my opinion , are a very hard act to follow , in terms of special effects and scenes of destruction . as a result , i have to rate Killer Flood : the Day the Damn Broke at
473789	11423174	499554	4.0	better than i expected	( this comment refers to the unrated version ) i got this movie really cheap , so i wasn't too worried about how good it was . actually i expected it it be awful , and it really wasn't . there are actually some amusing moments here . the movie is based on the TV show of the same name . i haven't seen the show , but i don't think that matters too much . it sort of reminded me of the Police Academy movies ( although these cops aren't in training , they're just inept ) and Super Troopers . i pretty much hated Super troopers and found the Police Academy movies not that funny . i think Reno 991 Miami is better than both . but if you did like Super Troopers or Police Academy , you should like this movie . it isn't for everyone , though . it's rude crude , lewd , obnoxious , offensive and sexist , and just about anything you can think of . if any of the above don't appeal to you , this is not your movie . even though it was better than i expected , i would give it no more than a
473818	11423174	358349	4.0	strictly cheap laughs and lame story	talk about disappointing . this sequel has none of the heart of the original . the first one was silly , but at least it had a semblance of story , and the laughs were honest . here , it's all about the cheap laughs . this movie is slow and boring , with a lame story . if it didn't go direct to video , it should have . Anthony Anderson is in this one , and he can usually be counted on for some good laughs , but he has nothing to work with here . this is case where they should just have stuck with the original , or at least put some more thought into the sequel . it feels rushed , but then it was , considering it came out merely a year later than the first one . Agent Cody Banks 2 : Destination London gets a from me .
472759	11423174	107090	4.0	generic crime thriller with out the thrills	to me , this is just a standard suspense thriller / crime drama . although , in reality , it isn't really thrilling or suspenseful . in fact , it could be a TV episode from a crime show . except for the bit of nudity . you have your usual cast of characters , criminals looking for something , murders , witnesses , plot twists that aren't . i like Marlee Matlin and D . B . Sweeney , but i didn't sense any chemistry between them . the story itself is , like i said , fairly generic , and uninvolving , with a few things that don't add up . in other words , logic gaps . to be fair there are a few tense moments , adding up to maybe five minutes or so of the total running time . otherwise , it's slow and yawn inducing . for me , Hear no Evil is a
472969	11423174	113636	4.0	funnier than both 1 and 2 , but don't expect to be scared at all	this installment of the " Leprachaun " franchise is better than the last two . it's still not great , in fact , it's not quite good either . but it does have a much better pace to it . there are a few more funny moments and one almost hysterical sequence . the body count is higher in this one , and Warwick Davis , once again as the Leprachaun , really gets to cut loose at times . there's definitely a higher energy level this time around . the movie is still not scary at all . and once again , the story is not connected to the previous entries , other than having the same psycho Leprechaun trying to get back his gold . this time , the setting is Las Vegas . for me , so this third " Leprechaun " is the best of the series so far .
472997	11423174	107254	4.0	part 9 ( )	this ninth movie is in the Friday the 13th series , pretty much ignores the previous ones . sure , it's still Jason , and he still psychopath with a hockey mask . but otherwise there isn't a lot of similarity . for one thing , in this one they offer an explanation for his unstoppable evil . it's an interesting explanation , but it adds things to the lore that were not in the previous movies , except fro a very brief hint in the 6th or 7th one , i can't recall which . anyway , this movie starts off very promising , but loses traction and end up becoming boring save for a few exciting moments . i viewed the unrated version and it's pretty graphic in its violence . i thought this was slightly better than the previous effort , Jason Takes Manhattan , but only slightly . for me , Jason goes to Hell is a
472549	11423174	102803	4.0	should be rated at least PG-13	the rating on this movie is on this site . but it's not as good as i had expected or hoped . that rating is about 2 stars too high for me . for one thing , i found it too insubstantial , with a pretty weak story . the potential was there , but it just wasn't realized . there also existed the possibility of some humour in the movie , but that doesn't really develop either . it's also slow , with only intermittent scenes of action . there's almost no character development . as a matter of a fact , there were a few characters that had almost nothing to do . this movie runs about 104 minutes without end credits , but i had to stop it , to break up the monotony . the American and Canadian rating on this movie is PG , but i think it should be at least PG-13 . i think it's a bit too intense for any under 13 , but that's just me . nevertheless , parents should use their discretion . my vote for The Rocketeer is a
473172	11423174	449471	4.0	should have remained buried	i can't think of too much to like about this alleged horror movie . to me , it lacked any real scares . there is a bit of suspense though not very much . the setting has promise : Catacombs beneath the streets of Paris . that's certainly an eerie place to base a horror film . but , for whatever reason , it just didn't work for me . and i gotta say , this thing is predictable almost from the get go , right to the end . it is loud though , with a pumping rock soundtrack throughout the first half . plus , there are a few things that don't make a lot of sense . normally that shouldn't matter in a horror movie . but when it doesn't do its job , you start to nitpick and look for faults . sometimes it's the only way too keep from being completely bored . for me , The Catacombs is a
472631	11423174	345074	4.0	not really suited to my tastes	this movie isn't for me , but i could see how people would like it . it has two very likable leads in Nia Vardalos and Toni Collette . both are great actresses and work well off each other very well here . they both have great comedic timing . and their are some great witty moments here . but for me , there's just too many musicals , and i'm not really a musical fan . plus , i kinda found the film quite slow . i'm not really into the drag queen scene in movies either . i knew what the movie was about before watching it but i still thought id ' give it a shot . if you're a musical fan and you have a bit of patience , this movie might work for , and you might really enjoy it . my vote for Connie and Carla is a
472544	11423174	1059793	5.0	good for the kids , but has some scary looking characters	i don't quite no what to make of this film . this is Garfield's first CG animated movie . i thought it had some amusing moments , but nothing laugh out loud funny . the story is very simple , so kids will be able to follow it very easily . the voices were very fitting for the characters . the CG in general looks nice and pretty . that's the good news . the bad news ? some of the characters look quite freaky , almost scary , i think . . i also found the movie very slow for much of the time . i realise i'm much older than the target audience . for kids , if they don't find some of the characters too creepy , they will probably enjoy it . adults might like it too , and if not , at least they know their kids are watching kid friendly entertainment . for me , i give Garfield Gets Real a
473925	11423174	382625	5.0	underwhelming	after watching this movie , i have one overriding feeling . that of being underwhelmed . there was lot of hype for this movie , but it just didn't live up to it for me . it should have been better . i mean , it had good actors and a decent story . and the dialogue was OK . but . for whatever reason , it just didn't resonate with me . i guess the biggest reason is that i found it slow and boring . i found the end way too protracted fro my tastes . i also believe they could have shaved 30 minutes off of it . i also think Tom Hanks's character was too low key In this movie . for another ' quest ' movie , i would recommend National Treasure . it's not as deep , but i felt it was much more fun and action packed . but that's just my opinion . for me , The Da Vinci Code is a .
472784	11423174	453556	5.0	disappointing , to say the least	this is the first CG animated adventure of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . i had fairly high hopes for this movie . unfortunately , it didn't live up to them . i found the story lacking and uninteresting . plus , it just moves too slow . i didn't find the action scenes very good either . honestly , i just didn't thin the movie was worthy of the characters . it's CG animated , so it looks really nice . the voice actors were good . but the rest of the movie was lacking . i just was not engaged at all . maybe i just expected too much given the history of the characters . even though i didn't like the movie too much , i wouldn't call it horrible and there are a lot of worse movies out there , most of which i have seen . in my opinion , TMNT is a
472956	11423174	325234	5.0	' mockumentary ' on parking enforcers	here we have a ' mockumentary ' ( fake documentary ) on the people who enforce the parking laws . you know who i mean . you leave your car , and come back to it , only to find that nice little piece of paper on it . you know the 1 that says you have to pay a fine because you parked 30 seconds too long at the metre , or you parked half an inch to far from the curb . well the movie is about the people who put those nice pieces of paper on the windshield , i person in particular . this person's name is Grant , and Grant is of the opinion that his job is very important . it is a public service , and to hear him talk about it , akin to curing disease . they even have a ' guru'of parking enforcement named Murray which they revere very highly , like a god . they even spout philosophical drivel from the man himself . this movie should be funny , but it isn't . it is mildly amusing ( and i do mean mildly ) at best . there is nothing profound in this movie , that i can see . i wouldn't recommend renting it , but if you see it on TV , and you have nothing else to do , it will serve as a diversion for around 90 minutes . it is less than 90 minutes , and it does go by quickly , so that is a plus . others may find some this movie hysterical and even ' deep'but for me , it is average entertainment at best . ' my vote for ' The Delicate art of Parking ' ?
473012	11423174	54594	5.0	much better than the Robin Williams remake Flubber	i won't say this a great movie , but i will say it sure beats the dreadful 1997 remake called Flubber starring Robin Williams . that movie was tedious , to say the least . this movie , at least , was somewhat entertaining , if not all that funny . there are a couple of mildly amusing moments . there is a lot of overacting , which i have found quite typical of Disney movies of that era ( 1950's through 70's ) but that was probably funny back then . Fred MacMurray plays the main character , professor Brainard , a chemistry professor who discovers a new compound that should revolutionize the world . of course , he's so busy working on his experiments , he neglects everything else in his life . MacMurray is very appealing and likable , as he is in any of his movies . my vote for The Absent Minded Professor is a
473607	11423174	83033	5.0	average spoof , with a few amusing moments	this is a spoof of other movies of that era , some horror , some not . i found it silly more than anything , and at times it denigrates into near stupidity . i was able to watch the whole movie , though it is quite slow at times . it does have some mildly amusing moments , coupled with some intentionally ( or not ) ultra cheap special effects , and some really bizarre looking monsters , some even stupid looking . this movie definitely inspired other movies down the road , some good , some bad . there isn't really anything resembling acting in the movie , except for Richard Benjamin who is quite good as the unflappable ( or clueless ) father who doesn't bat an eye , no matter what bizarre happenings are occurring right under his nose . he is quite amusing at times . otherwise , there is a lot of screaming and running around . For me , " Saturday the 14th " is a
473924	11423174	120245	5.0	not quite what i had hoped , but racing buffs will probably enjoy it	i should mention that i'm not really a racing fan . nevertheless , i picked this documentary up fairly cheap , and i thought it might be interesting and thrilling . and to be fair , it was-to a point . the scenes with the closeups of the car racing as it's being tested are quite exciting . the cameras are right on the car , so you can't get any closer unless you're actually behind the wheel . theses scenes really show you how skilled the drivers are and how dangerous the sport can be . and hearing the roar of engines was something . you really get an idea of how powerful they are . but for me , there were'nt enough of those moments . a lot of the time is spent showing how a car ( at least one car ) is manufactured . i knew before hand that there were would be some focus on this aspect . i just thought they devoted too much time to it . f you're into that sort of thing of thing , you will probably enjoy theses scenes . but for me , i'm not really into that sort of thing , so i found those scenes dry . there is a making of feature , which is almost as long as the documentary itself . this is not something that would interest me , so i did not watch it . however , if you're a racing fan , or you're just interested in the behind the scenes of the documentary , you might like the making of . overall , for me , i was kinda disappointed . i don't think the documentary is terrible by any stretch , but it did not live up to my expectations . i'd have to give Super Speedway a
473558	11423174	87075	5.0	a bizarre , very stylistic take on " little red riding hood "	Neil Jordan's company of wolves is a strange movie , to say the least . it is esoteric and surreal , and filled with imagery and symbolism . aesthetically speaking it is beautiful to watch . this is not a movie about werewolves per SE , but a commentary on the human condition and the beast that lurks within us all . the movie also contains strong sexual undertones and delves a bit into some disturbing subject matter including a young girl , perhaps fourteen or fifteen and an adult male . there are strong undercurrents of sexual chemistry between the two , and while nothing sexual does occur , the implication is clearly there . the movie is purely fantasy , of course , and at times cartoonish , sometimes to the point of absurdity . at times it is simply a parody of itself . the transformations are nothing spectacular , which may be intentional . the movie doesn't take itself seriously but is certainly not a comedy . it is certainly stylish , and also has substance , which is not readily apparent , at first glance . it is interesting to watch , and i can't say whether i will watch it again or not . i didn't dislike nor did i particularly like it . it is however a unique experience . i should mention that there is one scene which i found quite disgusting which occurs about twenty minutes in , so you might want to prepare yourself . certainly a hard film to rate , but i will give it based on the look of the film and its uniqueness . not for everybody . out of 10
473638	11423174	211181	5.0	a pale imitation of it's predecessor	unfortunately , this second live action film is a pale imitation of its predecessor . it's a lot slower , and the story feels contrived . it almost seems like filler to me . there are a few comic moments , though not as many as its predecessor . i think they should have left it at the first one , 101 Dalmatians . Glenn Close returns as Cruella De Vil , and is good , but has much less to do this time around . plus , her two henchmen form th preventions film are not in this one , and they added some comic relief . Gerard Depardieu is in this one , in a completely ridiculous role , and he looks quite silly , to be polite . despite its problems its still watchable . my vote for 102 Dalmations is a
473315	11423174	338094	6.0	decent family fare	this Eddie Murphy movie is actually pretty good . it's funny , spooky and mysterious . the title pretty much says what it's about . basically , Murphy's character and his family are drawn into a mystery involving an old , obviously haunted mansion . i thought Jennifer Tilly was very funny here . it's PG rated movie , so it's suitable for most viewers . there maybe a few scenes a bit too intense for very young viewers . other than that , it's clean viewing entertainment . it's got a current low rating of 4 . 8 , which i don't happen to agree with at all . it may not be Eddie Murphy's finest hour , but so what . it's a decent family movie that kids and most adults should enjoy too . my rating for The Haunted mansion is
472912	11423174	422774	6.0	a bit funnier than Are We There yet ?	i thought this sequel to Are We There Yet was pretty good . it's a bit funnier . it's based on the classic movie Mr . Blandings builds his dream House , but it also has a lot of the Money Pit thrown in . John C . McGinley is very funny in his role . i don't want to say what that role is , because that would be spoiling things . but trust me , he's pretty funny . as with the first movie , this one is predictable , so there's no surprise how it will end . there's a bit of innuendo here , but no bad language . i'm surprised at the low rating ( ) which in my mind is nowhere near fair . for me , this is a movie that is pretty much good for the whole family . i give Are We Done Yet ? a
473540	11423174	780583	6.0	zombie free for all !	this is one of the gorier zombie flicks i have seen in a while . it takes awhile to get to that point , though . once it does , it basically becomes barely controlled chaos , mayhem and carnage . this is not a big budget movie by any stretch , but i think it's played as camp , more than anything , so the low budget doesn't really matter . there are some very funny scenes , which i think are intentional . the movie is never boring . it's even fun at times . the acting won't win any awards , but basically , it's just a zombie free for all , so there isn't really a lot of acting required . if you can get around the absurd premise , and if you're a gore hound , this could be the movie for you . for me , even though i enjoyed it , there were some moments that were a bit too sick for me . as a result , i would have to give Flight of the Living Dead : Outbreak on a Plane a
473307	11423174	85811	6.0	a decent sword and sorcery / fantasy film	while this is not the best film of the sword and sorcery / fantasy genre , i did like it . i found it fast paced , and never boring . yet strangely , i never really found it exciting either . and there were some things about it i found absurd . many people will find the special effects quite quaint by today's standards , and i guess they are , although that didn't really bother me in this movie . i really liked the look of the film . i do think the that the story was a bit weak , and they could have added to it . the movie felt a bit incomplete at the end , in my mind . i did find the ending anti climatic . i found the acting to be understated , but good from all concerned . there have been a lot of similar movies since then ( and some before then ) some better , some worse . for me , this movie falls closer to the better category . the movie on the whole actually reminded me a lot of the 1938 version of Robin Hood , and i mean that in a good way . when you add it all up , i think Krull is about a
473252	11423174	99044	6.0	not as good as the original but still pretty decent	this sequel to 48 Hours has a much darker tone than the original . it's more violent , with probably even more very strong language . there is a bit less comedy , but the comic bits are a bit funnier than in the first one . the action is thorough the roof in this one . it's much more exciting . i liked the storyline more . it's more developed and a bit more complex . the plot isn't that original , but the movie is well executed . the movie is a bit too formulaic at times though . Eddie Murphy gets to show a little of his impression talent in this one . the dialogue , while pretty good for the most part , is at times overdone and a bit of a stretch . overall , i think this movie is pretty decent , but not quite as good as the first one . for me , Another 48 hours is a .
473581	11423174	478087	6.0	liked it , didn't love it	while i liked this movie , i didn't love it . it was entertaining , but not really very substantive . plus , while watching , i couldn't help but think i'd had seen the movie before , under a different title and with different actors . the name of said movie still escapes me . to be fair though , when you make a film centered around the subject of gambling , there's isn't too much you can do to distinguish one from another . i will say , though , that i thought Kevin Spacey was brilliant in his performance and Laurence Fishburne was equally good . Spacey and Fishburne owned the movie in their scenes . Kate Bosworth and Jim Sturgess were also in the movie , but were overshadowed by Spacey & & & possible minor spoilerSpacey and Fishburne are hardly really in the movie and i don't think he and i don't think they had any scenes together . i was mildly entertained , and never bored , but nothing beyond that . for me , 21 is a
472651	11423174	360717	6.0	a good movie that had the potential for greatness	i was very disappointed in king kong . i thought it would be better than it was it . takes to long to get to the action , focusing much too long on the romance between two of the main characters . there were some exciting moments to be sure , but there was also a lot of repetition . sometimes the action went much longer than it should have . this film had some humour injected into it , which the original did not have . however , the humor is misplaced in this film , and just doesn't work . it almost seems like a time filler and very contrived , and slows the movie down . there are also some whimsical moments in the film , which take away from kong's dignity and majesty , making him not quiet wimpy , but less of a force to be reckoned with . on the plus side , the ape is very realistic looking , including the hair and eyes , which are very hard to make natural using cgi . however , the ape's movements are sometimes herky jerky , showing cgi still has a few bugs to work out . that's not to say this is a bad film . it's not . it's just not as good as it could have been . It is too long , and could have benefited from some editing . and it could have been paced better . i have to give this film a rating
472638	11423174	109444	6.0	better than Patriot Games , but still pretty slow and boring	while i don't think this is a great movie , i do think it is better than the the last one , Jack Ryan film , Patriot Games . in Clear and Present Danger , Harrison Ford once again plays Jack Ryan . this one has a bit more intrigue than Patriot Games , and i also like the story more . it is more developed . to me , this one has a bigger scope . there is bit more urgency as well . having said that , i still think this movie is boring and slow , more often than not . Like Patriot Games , it's certainly not awful , but again i think maybe something got lost in the translation from Tom Clancy's novel . it's also almost 2 and a half hours long , and i think they could have trimmed some of it . still , it has it's good moments . for me , Clear and Present Danger is a
472763	11423174	37536	6.0	sequel to Going my Way	this is the sequel and more famous cousin to Going my Way . Bing Crosby reprises his role of Father O'Malley . Ingrid Bergman co-stars . this movie is much deeper than it's predecessor , and has a much better , stronger story . Crosby and Bergman are both brilliant here . the story has some very touching moments . i welled up a few times . there are strong themes of hope and faith and miracles here , and the human spirit . wheres there are a quite a few lighter , comedic moments in Going my Way , there aren't that many here . it's much more serious in tone . i don't know if Bergman and / or Crosby won academy awards for their portrayals , but they give award worthy performance . the movie does feel a bit long and there are some slow moments , but overall , i liked it . i give The Bells of St . Mary's a
472852	11423174	87298	6.0	great ending ( )	this fourth entry in the series is actually not too bad . i liked it a bit better than the other 3 , mainly because of the ending , which was pretty climactic , unlike many movies . plus , it was better paced . this one features a 12 year old Corey Feldman , but i still liked it . it pretty much follows the familiar formula of the last 3 . minor spoilerit's called the Final Chapter , but if you've followed the series at , you know it isn't . end of spoilerit probably was going to be , but then the filmmakers realized they had a cash cow on their hands , and couldn't pass up the opportunity to keep churning them out . whether that's good or bad is a matter of opinion . in any case , my vote for Friday the 13th : The Final Chapter is a
473734	11423174	76630	6.0	similar to " deliverance " but i don't think it's quite as good	this is not a bad movie . it's sort of like " Deliverance " . 5 friends go on a backwoods trip together . they are each doctors or former doctors . anyway , as the film progresses , things start to happen to the group . small things at 1st , than things get serious . the group realizes they are being stalked and terrorized by an unseen enemy , and their lives are in danger . the movie has its share of suspense and excitement . but it also has its share of tedious moments . the ending in particularly drags on way too long for my tastes . on the whole , though , this is worth watching . it came out in 1977 , so some modern audiences might not like it or even relate to it . if you liked " Deliverance " give this 1 a chance . i don't think it's quite as good , but it's in a similar vein . i think Rituals is
472731	11423174	295590	6.0	modern day pirate ends up searching for buried treasure	this is a movie about a modern day pirate ( or at least , that's what he calls himself . really though he is simply a charter boat captain for hire and thief . his job does get him into some hairy situations , meaning a fair amount of action . there is even some intrigue and some romance as weals a hunt for buried treasure . captain Jefferey Thorpe ( Thomas Ian Griffith ) has 2 sidekicks who travel everywhere with him . mostly there for comic relief i guess . this has all the ingredients to be a great movie , yet it isn't . this whole sub genre of film has been done many times before , so there is little new or original in this movie . However , there is 1 thing this movie has going for it : Gerit Kling , who plays the dual role of Helna / Marlena and also the love interest of Thorpe . ( Griffith ) Kling is truly a stunning woman and when you combine that with her German accent , it's enough to make most men melt . ( i did anyway ) Griffith makes a credible action hero , if only the movie had something new to offer . despite the problems withe film , i'd still give it a , mostly for the beautiful love interest .
472698	11423174	420294	6.0	gorier than ever	if you're a gore hound , you will love this movie . i think it it is much gorier than any previous entry in the franchise . in fact , i think this movie makes any of the Friday the 13th movies look like an episode of Mr . Rogers Neighbourhood . this one just about crosses my gore threshold . having said that , i don't feel this movie was as thrilling as the previous ones . id didn't really feel any adrenaline rush . in fact , i thought some parts were slow . i did , however like how they showed that the genesis of both Leatherface and the rest of the family . they didn't spend a lot of time on this aspect , but i think they pretty much covered everything they needed . i also really liked the music . i thought it set a great tone for the movie . whether it's a better movie than The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake of 2001 is a matter of personal taste . for me , Texas Chainsaw Massacre : The Beginning is a
473724	11423174	97674	7.0	one of Pixar's early efforts	i thought this early animated short from Pixar was quite good . it's funny and ironic , plus it has a very catchy and infectious tune . it's also very low key , and movies at a nice sedate pace , which i liked a lot . it's from 1989 , so it's a lot different than the animated films we have today . it's a very simple short with a simple story . considering it is nearly 20 years old , it's actually very well done . it's also much more clever than many animated shorts from today , and certainly back then . i'd check it out if you have the chance . you might be surprised at how much you enjoy it . or you might not be . either way , it's not like you're losing a couple of hours . for me , Knick Knack is a
472719	11423174	336325	7.0	not as good as Dracula 2000 , but not bad ( )	this is a sequel to Dracula 2000 , but not completely . it's still about Dracula , but it begins shortly after the first one ended . the thing is , spoiler ahead it ignores the ending of 2000 . if you paid attention to the very end of that film , you'll realize that the events in this one couldn't happen the way they do . end of spoileroh , well , that's life . it still has the same biblical bent to it . but this one lacks many of the things 2000 had . gone is Gerard Butler as the title character , a fairly big loss , in my opinion . this Dracula ( the character ) is not as compelling , nor did i feel he was seductive or charming . gone is also the visual style of 2000 . there's also no macabre humour here . nor is there much action . what is added is some overacting by many of the cast involved . While i don't have anything against Jason Scott Lee , i feel he was trying way too hard to make the character serious . minor spoileroh , and if you're expecting to see Roy Schieder ( he is billed as being one of the stars of the movie ) then you better not blink , or you'll miss him . overall , this entry is not as fun as Dracula 2000 , but i still thought it was OK . For me , Dracula II : Ascension is a
472537	11423174	327554	7.0	a fun movie , undeserving of all the harsh criticism	i don't understand why so many people hated or disliked the movie catwoman . i thought it was a fun movie to watch . the acting was pretty good . i liked the villain . there was lots of action and i loved the music . also , Halley berry is very sexy and looked great in the catwoman costume . i liked the mysticism involving cats . i thought that was unique . i also like the fact that instead of the usual male villain , we have a strong female villain , played by sharon stone . she did a good job in the role , i thought . i liked how catwoman was self conflicted about being evil versus being good and the suduction it held . i bought this movie and have watched it more than once . i enjoyed it and will watch it again . i just wish people would lighten up . 6 & out 10
472685	11423174	486051	7.0	this one has a few chills	i don't agree with the rating ( ) this movie has on this site . i actually thought it deserved a higher rating . it's a pretty eerie and creepy movie . it has a great atmosphere of dread and foreboding . at least i thought so . i always felt like something creepy was about to happen , which it did . but it usually creeped up slowly on you . there were no jump out of your seat moments . this is an old fashioned type chiller . there's no gore , no trick shots , no sudden loud noise to make you jump . this one keeps the creepy atmosphered right to the end . there is lots of suspense in this movie , and some fine acting from Emily Blunt , and Ashton Holmes , who play the the girl and the boy . we are never told their names . this movie is very deliberately paced , so if you're expecting a lot of action , this is probably the wrong movie for you . for me , though , i enjoyed it . my vote for Wind Chill is a
473410	11423174	107101	7.0	Chuck Norris in an effective supernatural thriller	this is a good , effective supernatural thriller with some light comedic elements combined . it is quite spooky and eerie . the basic outline is that 2 Chicago cops , Frank Shatter ( Norris ) and his partner Calvin Levels ( Calvin Jackson ) end up in Jerusalem ( you'll have to watch the movie ) as past of a routine murder investigation that is anything but routine . in fact , the fate of the world may depend on them . Norris and Jackson have good chemistry as the 2 partners and work well off each other . the partners have differing opinions on just about everything , which provides some amusing moments . i like the idea of Chuck going up against someone who may not be easy to defeat . i thought the movie was very entertaining and Chuck was convincing in his role as was Jackson . Sheree J . Wilson also plays a pivotal role in the film . Christopher Neame puts in an outstanding performance as the villain . Overall , a better than average movie . worth watching . a strong
472833	11423174	397065	7.0	fun horror film	many people really slagged this movie and Paris Hilton . i'm not sure why . Yes , it's a horror movie-and yes it's a remake of a 1953 movie with Vincent Price . so it can not be called original . but then again , how many people in the target audience have seen the original , or even know about it . so throw that argument out the window . As for Paris Hilton , she is not that bad of an actress . anyway , as for the movie itself , it's a fun thrill ride with a fair amount of suspense . the acting is as good as any for this genre , and it seemed as if the actors were really having fun with it . my advice pop the movie in , shut off your brain for the duration and enjoy . there are a lot worse movies out there . ( in this genre and others )
472711	11423174	222355	7.0	intense and thrilling	this movie could be called a blatant rip-off of " Jaws 3 " , at least the beginning of it . however it has an added twist and it's a much better movie . the shark attacks are really bloody and violent in this one , and the are frenetic at times . i'm not sure if this movie is better than the first , but it's still pretty good . again there's lots of action , and the sharks are fear inspiring . the acting is pretty good . the movie is a bit too melodramatic at times and lags once in awhile . even so , it's an entertaining movie with some thrills and some nail biting tension . there are a lot worse movies out there in the genre and in general . if you wanna fill 90 minutes or so , you could do a lot worse , and you may even enjoy it . my vote for " Shark Attack 2 " is
473591	11423174	100157	7.0	one of the better Stephen King novels adapted for the screen	this is one of the best Stephen King novels adapted for the big screen . this movie is well acted , well written and well directed . Kathy bates makes a great homicidal maniac . James Caan plays novelist Paul Sheldon who ends up being tormented by Annie Wilkes , who is his biggest fan . she goes to great lengths to prove just how big a fan she is . of course , she is also very angry at Sheldon , so of course he must be punished . i won't reveal how he comes to be tormented by her , or why she is angry at him , but she has her reasons , sick and twisted they may be . Caan is also convincing as a man who believes his life is in danger and is desperate to survive . anyway , the suspense factor is high in this one , as is the creepiness factor . for me , Misery is a
473793	11423174	107889	7.0	i didn't like it as much as Friday Night Lights . . . , but	i still liked it . i just felt that . . . Nights had a stronger story , and i was more emotionally involved . i also found the characters mote compelling . for me the program dragged at times , when there were scenes not involving football . fortunately these scenes weren't very long , and there weren't a lot of them . of all the actors in the movie , i was most impressed with Kristy Swanson and Halle Berry , though bad had fairly small roles . the program was entertaining enough to keep watching , i just didn't think it was spectacular . is it worth buying ? hard to say . but i do think it's certainly worth catching on premium cable or as rental . these are just my thoughts . my vote for the program :
472625	11423174	109707	7.0	different	this is an interesting film , sort of a biopic of Edward D . Wood Jr . , or Ed Wood , as he is more famously known . Wood apparently was one of the most inept filmmakers , ever . but he was also passionate about film . he just had trouble raising money , so he had to make his films on the cheap , usually with his friends in the cast . he also had no real idea about how to make a movie . his Plan Nine from Outer Space was at one time considered the worst movie ever made , and Wood became world famous for that reason . unfortunately this was two years after he died . anyway , Johny Depp plays the title character . there are some other well known actors here as well . the movie is at times sad , funny , enlightening , and certainly interesting . i mostly liked it , though i don't think it was a masterpiece . for me , Ed Wood is a
472989	11423174	1059786	8.0	a blockbuster popcorn flick	while this may be an action packed , thrilling movie , it is certainly full of holes and not too improbable , nor is it terribly original . it is fun though and fast paced , and if that's what your looking for , you'll enjoy it . conspiracy theorists will love this , and if you're not a fan of government / military , this will be right up your alley as well . there are plenty of explosions an car chases / accident . Shia LeBeouf and Michelle Monaghan are the main stars . Billy Bob Thornton . Rosario Dawson , Ethan Embry , Michael Chiklis and Anthony Mackie also star . it's basically a blockbuster popcorn movie . as a piece of entertainment , i think it does its job . it's not high art , or anything , but it's not supposed to be . i was quite entertained throughout . for me , Eagle Eye is an
472959	11423174	110657	8.0	Hilary Swank in an early role	this is the 4th movie in the Karate Kid series . however it has nothing to do with the previous 3 . the only character remaining is Mr Myagi . this time around Mr Myagi meets troubled teen Julie pierce ( Hliary Swank , before she was famous ) Julie having all kinds of Problem including being bullied at school by a guy , belonging to a pseudo military club on campus . Naturally she is trained how to fight . Anyway , through Myagi , Julie learns Karate and becomes a better person spiritually and learns how to respect herself and in the end regains her respect . i like the unique idea of the antagonist being a female and having a male as her enemy . i there are also some fight scenes which are done quite well , very low key and minimal violence . none of the fighting is graphic . the ending is also good and a bit surprising . it is predictable but not a typical ending for this kind of film . the film has echoes of the original obviously , especially the spiritual aspect and the lessons learned . it is not as good as the 1st movie , and certainly not as good as the 2nd . it is however , a giant leap forward compared to the underwhelming 3rd entry . this is a very entertaining under dog movie that is suitable for the whole family .
473665	11423174	30491	8.0	well done	even thought this movie was made in 1938 , the picture and sound quality are excellent . there are also subtitles , which was good . the movie itself is funny , fast paced , and well acted . Bonita Granville plays the title character , and brings some sassiness to the role . i also liked the supporting cast , particularly her Sidekick Ted . i thought he had some funny lines . the chief of police was also a funny character . i thought the writing was good and i liked the story . even though the movie is 66 minutes , it didn't feel rushed or incomplete . it was well paced . this is the first of four movies in which Bonita Granville portrays Nancy , and if this any indication , i can't wait to watch the other three . for me Nancy Drew - - Detective is an
473292	11423174	277296	8.0	not quite up to the standard of " The Mummy " films , but still rates pretty high	this film is a prequel to both of " The Mummy " films stars " The Rock ( Dwayne Johnson ) in the title role . i don't think this film measures up to either of the two " Muumy " films , but it's still pretty good . the fight scenes are quite good , there is some humour , tons of action and good acting . The Rock actually impressed me with his acting ability . he showed a lot of potential in this film and didn't stink up the theatre , as i thought he would . this movie doesn't have a lot to do with the previous entries . the story is quite a bit different . there is a lot more mysticism and romance and none of the main characters from the first two have returned for this movie . this is really The Rock's movie , and he has to carry it . he does a pretty good job for his first big starring feature . though not as good as the two " Mummy " films , tit still rates high in my book . for me , " The Scorpion King " is a solid
472564	11423174	112692	8.0	i found it suspenseful and unpredictable ( i liked it )	you know , i really liked this movie . i thought it was suspenseful and exciting , with some twists i didn't see coming . i also didn't see the ending coming either , which , for me , is a good thing in a movie . there are a number of suspects in the movie and it really keeps you guessing . i also like Kim Delaney a lot . i think she's a pretty decent actress . i'm still not sure why she was let go from CSI : Miami , but that's another story . she plays the lead in this movie , a thriller writer named Kate Saunders . Kate begins receiving these strange e-mails from someone calling himself Thrillkill . Thrillkill has apparently been inspired by a villain in one of Kate's novels . his messages even claim he was created by Kate . Thrillkil begins killing women in exactly the same way as the villain in Kate's novels . i won't say anymore about the plot . lets just say what follows is suspense and excitement , and some twists . i liked " Closer and Closer " quite a bit . for me , it's a strong
473650	11423174	66249	8.0	a different type of Sherlock Holmes movie	though i haven't seen every Sherlock Holmes movie ever made , i have seen a few , and this one is much different . i found it darker in tone , and with a very compelling story . it also delves deeper into the character of Holmes , in a personal light . i liked the story and i also liked the acting . i had not seen a Billy Wilder film before , and probably never would have , if it weren't for this being a Sherlock Holmes movie . but i thought his was a well done movie . there's a definite sadness to it that isn't in any of the other Holmes movies i have seen . there a few comic bits . actually more like dark humour . it's around 2 hours in length , but doesn't feel long at all . for me , The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes is an
473280	11423174	451262	8.0	low budget , but creepy and suspenseful	WithIN aka " The Cavern " starts off slow and has some dialogue and scenes in the beginning which should have been cut from the movie , as they weren't necessary . however , once it gets going , it's actually not a bad movie . i liked the camera work , especially the tight shots in the cavern . also in certain scenes it was hard to tell it where the characters were or if they were moving up or down . this was done deliberately to keep the viewer off balance and uneasy . it worked quite well as i was unsettled throughout most of the movie . the movie also had sort of a documentary style to it , which i thought added to the atmosphere and gave it a more authentic feel and i liked the inventive use of the camera . i'm fairly sure it had a very modest budget , yet that didn't detract from the quality of the film . i didn't recognize any of the actors , but they all did a good job and were believable . this was good , since big name actors would have taken the focus away from the story , and taken the viewer out of the movie . the cavern wasn't a particularly scary movie , but it was creepy and suspenseful . I don't recall seeing anything quite like it . there are some scenes which may be a bit to gory for some people and there is one fairly intense violent scene . the ending was different than i expected , but not in a bad way . the filmmakers managed to fit a lot into the short running time , but i still believe it could have been a bit longer . otherwise , a pretty good , not quite great movie that will keep you entertained . i bought it and have no regrets . definitely worth renting , at least .
473881	11423174	91624	8.0	TV news anchor faces moral dilemma	this movie basically about a moral and ethical dilemma facing a popular news anchor . martin Sheen Plays news anchor Frank Kenley , newly hired by a news station flailing in low ratings . Kenley is brought on board because he is respected int thee field , and it is hoped he will bring the stations ratings up . things go well , until Frank is faced with moral dilemma , whether to go public with some information that may damage a certain individual'd reputation , or withhold the information , and not letting the public know the story , possibly endangering others in the process . Kendry is faced with 2 obstacles - rookie reporter / co anchor Christine Arnold ( Sheree . J . Wilson ) whose enthusiasm and inexperience only make things worse-and his boss Eric Ross ( Peter Riegert ) who has no moral centre and will do whatever it takes to increase ratings , no matter who gets hurt . this is a made for TV movie ( 1985 ) but it is pretty well done . good acting all around and an important issue : morals and ethics . this can be applied to life in general , not just in the news room and you can't help but think about it after the credits roll . i've said this before , i don't normally go in for issue and moral type movies , but this movie is also entertaining , and well done .
473384	11423174	120755	8.0	not hard to follow , but the script blew up in the first of way too many explosions	this movie is a different beast than the first one . oh , sure , it has some of the same characters and is also a spy movie / secret agent film . whereas the first one was so convoluted , you needed a map to follow it , this sequel doesn't suffer from that same deficiency . it's much easier to follow alright . the reason being that they sacrificed story and character for nothing but wall to wall action . now , i'm all for action , but not at the expense of everything else . when this was over , i felt liked i'd been in the Iron Man Triathlon . not only that , but there is next to now believability in this , at least in the stunt dept . the could have made the costumer's job a lot easier by having the characters all wear a red cape and blue underwear . at least there would have been some believability . also , it seems everything in the movie blew up somewhere along the way . i think the script blew up as well . certainly this movie was more exciting than the first one , but there be some balance . i'll give " Mission Impossible 2 a
473684	11423174	349710	8.0	surprisingly entertaining	i was surprised about this movie . it was much more entertaining than i though it would be . it also moves along at a good pace . Joaquin Phoenix's character is the main focus of the story , but i think John Travolta steals the show . he has less screen time , but he gives a very credible and commanding performance . Robert Patrick is also in the movie , although he doesn't have a substantial role . still , i thought he was great with the scenes he had . he is one of the most underrated actors out there , in my book . Phoenix does a god job as the main character , bu like i said , this movie is Travolta all the way . anyway , there is one scene in the movie which is a bit of a downer . other than that though , for entertainment value you can't beat his movie . my vote for Ladder 49 is a
473301	11423174	95271	8.0	the best of the Michael Myers movies	( this is actually the third Michael Myers film i ) found Halloween 4 : the Return of Michael Myers to be a better movie than the first two Michael Myers movies . i actually felt there were some tense and suspenseful moments in this one , unlike the previous two . i'm not including number three here , because it is a stand alone movie that has nothing to do with the Michael Myers character . the movie also has a much eerier feel to it . i also thought the acting was actually pretty good in this one . in the first two , i didn't think too much of the acting . even though i found the movie to be good overall , the best part for me , was the ending . i thought it was great . maybe predictable , but still great . for , me this movie came closest in the series to delivering the goods for this genre . i didn't find it scary , but like i said , it was tense and suspenseful , and had a great atmosphere . for me , Halloween 4 : The Return of Michael Myers is an
473868	11423174	245046	8.0	very good movie set during the time of the second World War	" Charlotte Gray " takes place during the second World War . Charlotte becomes a courier in France , to help the war effort . but she has her own reasons for joining . being a courier is a dangerous job and most do not survive . the movie , while not depressing , is certainly sad at times . it is quite compelling and well written , and very well acted . Cate Blanchett is an extraordinary actress . it's hard to take your eyes . she is very beautiful , but also talented beyond belief . there are some other great actors in the movie as well . this is one of the better war tome movie out there . i say war time because , although the movie takes place during the second World War , we don't see a lot of the war action . we do , however , get to see its results . for me , " Charlotte Gray " is a very good movie . i give it a strong
473858	11423174	91474	8.0	classic action / thriller	" man hunter " was released in 1986 and is a prequel to " the silence of the lambs . it was remade in 2002 , with different actors under the name " red dragon " and while both movies are very good , there are some differences . man hunter is very atmospheric in tone , utilizing music more . it is very stylistic , yet also has substance . the action and drama scenes are well done and lit very effectively . the film is much darker in its mood or tone than red dragon , and very effective in building suspense . the acting is well done , particularly william peterson in one of his earliest performances . i really enjoyed the movie and cared about the characters and became emotionally involved . well done movie . will more than satisfy fans of the genre .
473849	11423174	53221	8.0	review of Ultimate Collector's edition	i really like this Western . it stars John Wayne , Ricky Nelson , Dean martin and Angie Dickinson , to name a few . the acting is superb in this movie . but what i really like is the dialogue and the unique mix of characters . the story is also good . it's straightforward and simple . Unlike The Searchers , another John Wayne movie . Rio bravo is not a sweeping , grand epic . it takes place in basically one town . nevertheless , i found it engaging and compelling . this edition contains a raft of extras , including two documentaries and a short featurette . Like the Ultimate edition of The Searchers , here is also a reproduction of the 1959 Dell comic book , a reproduction of the original press book from 1959 , and 8 full colour lobby cards . as for the movie itself , i think it's pretty well done , and deserves a . the collection is definitely worth having , and i give that an .
473108	11423174	408790	8.0	very harrowing , but	i don't think it's realistic . plus , there are a lot of plot holes and inconsistencies , in my mind . but the acting is first rate from all , and it had me guessing to the end . it was unpredictable enough that i wasn't sure who was good or bad , until the end . plus , the ending was different than i thought it would be . and the movie is certainly harrowing and will get your adrenaline pumping . the only problem is , i just couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to get around all the unanswered questions . normally that isn't an issues for me , but it just becomes too much . despite that , i still give it high mark due to how harrowing and entertaining it is . for me , Flightplan is an . if you can suspend your disbelief enough , you will probably really like this movie .
473642	11423174	55254	8.0	fun for the whole family	i really enjoyed this animated Disney classic . it's just a lot of fun . lots of action and excitement , and an excellent choice for the villain in Cruella Devil . whose is iconic ( or should be ) in my opinion . very young children may be a bit frightened of her , as she certainly is scary looking . her 2 henchman are quite inept , and provide a lot of comic relief . i also really liked the voice acting . i thought it fit well with the characters . the animation is also good , considering it is from 1961 , though i'm sure it took a few years before that to complete . anyway , in my opinion , this classic is good fun for the whole family . my vote for 101 Dalmatians is an
472825	11423174	95963	8.0	great odd couple buddy cop movie ( east vs west )	if you like buddy cop movies , you should like this one . the film stars Arnie as strait laced , no nonsense Moscow detective Captain Ivan Danko , who must team up with loose cannon , goof ball , undisciplined Chicago cop Sgt . Art Ridzik ( James Belushi ) . i won't give away why they have to team up . i'll let you watch the movie to find out yourself . these two are about as mismatched a pair as possible . the movie is ripe with misunderstandings and comedic moments owing to the different tactics each employ on the case . Belushi and Arnie work great off each other . this is really a fun movie . in my mind , it's better than that other buddy movie " 48 Hours " which pairs up Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy . if you like that movie , i can't see how you would not like " Red Heat " . one of the elements that make this film work is the fact it takes place in 1988 , where the political climate between Russia and the U . S was much different than today . anyway , for me , " this movie is funny , action packed and all around entertaining . i give " Red Heat "
473484	11423174	463944	8.0	very good morality tale	i liked this movie . it's a movie about football , but it's much more than that . it's really about honor , truth , and loyalty . it is set in 1950 , and chronicles the " Army " - the West Point football team . West point is the very esteemed military academy . as the movie begins , " army is coming off of 27 consecutive wins and hope to win the championship once again . along the way , many on the team will go through some trials that will test their morality and pledge to uphold the principle of honor at any cost . the backdrop to the story is the Korean War . i like the fact the the story has some depth to it . the very fine performances go along way in anchoring the story . Scott Glenn gives a nice understated , quietly intense performance as one of of the coaches . even though this is a morality tale , it doesn't hit you over the head , or preach to you . all in all a pretty good movie . for me " Code Breakers " is an
473244	11423174	113497	8.0	once it gets going it's pretty darn fun	i have t say , this movie started out pretty slow , and i thought it was gonna be a dud . i'm glad i kept watching . it turned into a pretty good movie . if you're into action and adventure , you'll certainly find it in abundance here . there are some great action sequences , providing scads of excitement . but there are also a lot of very funny moments , and there's even a hint or 2 of romance . there are some fantastic creatures here . the only downside i can think of is the visual effects . i found them kinda cheesy , and sometimes they didn't quite look real . the creatures sometimes looked a bit wonky , but other times were pretty realistic . but that's a small downside , since the movie is so much fun . Robin Williams is the featured performer here , but i thought Bonnie Hunt was terrific . Bebe Neuwirth was very good as well . but David Alan Grier was a riot . Kirsten Dunst was good too . overall , this is a good movie for both kids and adults . for me , Jumani is a
472540	11423174	266915	8.0	funnier and more action packed than the first one	i found this movie to be better than the first one . there's still lots of action , but it's even funnier than the first . there's some really good fight scenes , and Jackie Chan's moves are even more outrageous this time around . the banter between Chan and Tucker is much funnier and more natural . once again , although there is some violence it's not excessive or gratuitous . i think there is also less coarse language than the first , and like the first , there is no nudity , but there is a bit of suggestiveness . overall , i though this movie was a great ride from start to finish . it's even faster paced than the original , and Tucker and Chan have even better general and comedic chemistry . for me , Rush Hour 2 is an
473583	11423174	29606	8.0	what price , fame ?	this is the first version of this movie made , and the only version i have seen so far . i liked it . i thought it was touching and ironic , and also tragic . it basically tells what the movie business can do to you , and the sacrifices that are made . it also shows how disposable the industry and the people in it are . as long as you are the flavour of the week , everything seems fine . but when you're no longer useful , reality hits and things can come crashing down . that's what basically happens in this story . it's an indictment ( ironically ) of the movie industry , however subtle . regardless , i thought it was well done . the acting by the tow leads , Janet Gaynor , and Frederic March , as well as the supporting performances , are terrific . i also thought the writing was very good , and the movie flows very well . for me , A Star is Born gets an
473691	11423174	97576	9.0	return to action	this third movie in the Indiana Jones series is much liter in tone than the second one , The Temple 0f Doom . there is also more action , a lot more . and there are also number of comic moments , courtesy of the banter between Indiana ( Harrison Ford ) and his Father , Henry ( Sean Connery ) the two have great general and comedic chemistry and both have some good lines . this movie is clever and witty . Connery is a nice addition to the series . i think it's as good , or near as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark , the first one in the series . i liked how the movie ended on a high note . this would have been a fitting end to the series , if they hadn't made a fourth installment , which i have yet to see . as for The Last Crusade , i think it rates a
473696	11423174	89880	9.0	lives up to the standard set by the first one	call me crazy , but i thought this movie was as good as the first one . true , it is a bit more far fetched and there is less of a story , but it makes up for that in sheer excitement . it's very fast paced from beginning to end . the first one had its share of action , but the action her is on a grander scale . i also liked seeing the different ways Rambo outsmarted and dispatched his enemies . and like the first one , Rambo lets his actions do the talking . he's not one to waste words . this movie is also a indictment of the Vietnam War . a subtle indictment , but it is there , nonetheless . overall , this is one fun movie , better than i remembered it from the last time i had seen it , when it first came out in the theatre . for me Rambo : First Blood Part II is a
473528	11423174	118771	9.0	gripping , edge of your seat thriller	this is one intense nail biting movie . basically , Jeffrey Taylor ( Kurt Russel ) and his wife Amy ( Kathleen Quinlan ) are driving on a lonely stretch of highway , when there vehicle inexplicably breaks down . they flag down a passing trucker who says he will take Amy to the nearest town for help while Jeff stays with the vehicle . flash forward sometime later and Amy has not returned . i leave it at that . if you wanna know more , then you'll have to watch the movie . what follows is nail biting suspense and tension and lots of action . you'll have to employ some suspension of disbelief ( though much less than many films ) once you do that , you should enjoy this movie . i was on the edge of my seat quite a bit . for me , " Breakdown is a
472880	11423174	618139	9.0	a very well done episode ( / )	this is one of the few full episodes of The Justice League series i have seen , and i liked it . this is the second episode of the third season of The Justice league . i liked it quite a bit . i thought the story was unique and interesting and pretty straight forward . this particular episode features Batman , Superman and Wonder Woman . the villain is more than match for both Batman and Wonder Woman and a even physical match for Superman . the episode is fast paced , and has great action sequences . it briefly shows a dark side of Superman , and even a lighter side . the voice casting is very good . each of the voices feel appropriate for the characters . for me , Justice League : For the Man Who Everything is an
473646	11423174	58700	9.0	way better version than the recently released I am Legend ( )	this is the 1st filmed version of Richard Matheson's novel entitled I am legend . the 2nd film version ( which i have yet to see ) is called The Omega men , starring Charlton Heston . the 3rd version is the recently released film starring Will Smith , also entitled I am Legend , which i pretty much hated . as for this 1st version , starring Vincent Price , i thought it was fantastic . there are some great moments of suspense and a real sense of emptiness and desolation . Vincent Price is great here in a non villain role . you can really see the hopelessness and despair he feels . i thought the ending was very good . the only complaint i have about this particular version is it has a few slow moments . otherwise , though , like i said , it's fantastic .
473653	11423174	430154	9.0	outstanding short film	this short film is actually a mock trailer for a film that doesn't actually exist . after watching Grayson , i wished the movie did exist . hopefully , it will get made some day . anyway , the story is about Dick Grayson ( the original Robin ) and his quest for vengeance after the death of his friend BruceWayne / Batman . i liked the story , and the acting is first rate here , as is the writing . i liked the characterization of each person involved . the film is actually very exciting . in fact , when it was over , i wanted more . there are many famous DC characters that make cameo appearances , which was a nice touch . the effects were good , considering the budget . it's obvious , that all involved in the making of this film put their hearts into it , and it shows . for me , Grayson is a
473661	11423174	257360	9.0	a thought provoking and enriching experience	i loved this movie . it's touching , funny and ironic . the title character played by Jack Nicholson is so likable , you can't help but root for him . and Nicholson really tones down his bigger than life " Jack " persona . there's no over the top scenery chewing here . his performance is very subtle and understated , and doesn't overshadow the supporting cast . the basic gist of the story is that Warren Schmidt has just retired , and ends up on a cross country journey that changes his life . along the way he discovers himself and meets some interesting characters , which provide some comic relief . there is strong supporting cast here , including Kathy Bates ( Misery ) Hope Davis , Dermot Mulroney and Howard Hesseman . not to sound maudlin , but this was a very and thought provoking and enriching experience . for me , About Schmidt is a well deserved
473389	11423174	104431	9.0	round 2 ( )	Home Alone 2 has pretty much the same general plot as the first one . a few of the particulars have changed , including the location . this time Kevin is Lost in New York , while his family is somewhere else . the 2 bumbling Robbers , Marv ( Daniel Stern ) and Harry ( Joe Pesci ) return and of course meet up with Kevin and slapstick ensues . this movie is a bit longer , and i felt it took a while to get going , but once it does , it's very funny . the booby traps Kevin designs are just as elaborate and cause a lot of pain and grief for Harry and Marv , and a lot of hilarity for the audience . this movie is a bit more touching and heartwarming than the first one , and at least as funny . the only downside for me is the slow beginning . otherwise , it pretty much lives up to the first one . for me , Home Alone 2 Is an
473048	11423174	163978	9.0	check out the novel by Alex Garland	this is one intense movie going experience . i don't wanna give too much away , but it has echoes of Lord of the Flies . if i'm not mistaken it's also similar to King Rat . it's directed by Danny Boyle ( Train Spotting , 28 days Later ) and Stars Leonardo DiCaprio , Tilda Swinton and Robert Carlyle . anyway , there's some great acting here . Tilda Swinton in particular impressed me . the dialogue is also well written . really the whole movie is well written . plus there is a high element of suspense and danger . it's based on a novel by Alex Garland , but i haven't read the novel , so i can't compare . i may just try to find the novel , so i can compare . as a movie though it's quite well done . for me , The Beach is an
473464	11423174	162661	10.0	Ichabod Crane vs The headless Horseman	Sleepy Hollow is a wonderful film . it is very atmospheric , visually stunning and very creepy . Tim Burton does a wonderful job of directing here . this a very well paced film with excellent acting performances from all . the great Johnny Depp plays the role of Ichabod Crane , a very quirky police investigator who , due to his radical theories , is banished to the remote village of Sleepy hollow . Once there it is his job to solve the mysterious murders supposedly perpetrated by the Headless Horseman . the movie is set in the latter half of the 18th century . The supporting cast all put in great performances . This a movie that will disturb you and keep you enraptured by it's beautiful visual style . Sleepy Hollow is also a movie of substance . Burton recreates the time and place very authentically . Though Burton can be hit and miss with his films , he hits the mark with this one .
473128	11423174	372784	10.0	one of the best superhero movies ever made	Batman Begins is easily one of the best superhero movies ever made . the movie basically tells the story of the genesis of the caped crusader . obviously , there is a fair amount of character development involved , which you would expect based on the title . but not so much that the film becomes tedious . Batman is shown as more of a full dimensional character than in previous incarnations . this version is also more faithful to the comic . Director Christopher Nolan shows great skill as a director , pacing the film very well . there are also some touches of humour throughout and we get to see a more human side to Bruce Wayne . The villains are also more fully realized than in most movies of the genre , instead of simply being devices for the hero ( the protagonist ) to have a villain ( antagonist ) to defeat . Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are standouts in their respective roles , as is Liam Neeson . Katie Holmes Has yet to reach the level of maturity require for her role , so she is a bit weak . This Batman movie is less cartoonish than previous efforts , and is closer to the realm of realism ( relatively speaking ) the movie is also more thoughtful than many movies depicting superheros there is much more substance . in fact more substance than style , though it is just stylistic enough . All in all a brilliant depiction of the origin of the caped crusader . this movie sets the bar high for its successor , the Dark Knight , which is to be released sometime in 2008 .
472771	11423174	462538	10.0	a laugh riot	i loved this movie . i was skeptical about it , thinking it would just be an overextended episode of the TV show . after all , many half hour shows have tried to transition into a successful feature length film , and very few actually succeed but since my friend bought it , i thought why not . as it turns out , this was one funny movie . and it actually had enough of a story to make a feature film . it was at least as funny as the earlier Simpsons episodes are , and a bit more risqué . but the bottom line is that it is hysterically funny . i don't know what else to say , other than i'm just so happy the the movie actually succeeds , with a decent storyline . it probably helps if you've seen the TV show first , but i don't think it's necessary . The Simpsons movie gets a from me
473458	11423174	405159	10.0	new shoes ? 30$ - - - - - - Million Dollar Baby ? priceless	every once in awhile , a movie comes along that defies description . Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby is that movie . One of the best movies ever made by one of the greatest directors , this is a movie that will not leave you untouched . Paul Haggis ( Crash ) wrote the screenplay for this cinematic treasure and the stage was set . with Eastwood as Director , the next piece of puzzle was the cast . And what a cast . You have Hilary Swank in a moving , powerhouse performance in the lead role . you have Eastwood himself in strong supporting role . and you have the great Morgan freeman in an understated , but no less superb performance . these three make it seem so effortless . the rest of the supporting players are also strong . I don't want to give too much away , for those who haven't had the pleasure yet . the basics of the film are as follows . Hilary Swank is Maggie Fitzgeraldd a woman who has nothing-but a desire to be a boxer . Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn , a grizzled boxing trainer , hardened by life . Morgan freeman is Eddie Dupris aka " Scrap " , Frankie's lone friend and Manager of his boxing club . Maggie walks into Frankie's life one day , desperate for him to train her . Frankie refuses at first and Maggie never gives up . Frankie finally relents ( with a bit of help from " scrap " . and the stage is set . What follows is the growing relationship between Maggie , Frankie and " Scrap " and the lessons they learn nd teach each other . until the end , with a closing act you won'soon ( if ever ) forget .
473427	11423174	97607	10.0	excellent drama dealing with the traumatic after effects of the Vietnam War	after just having watched The Deer Hunter , which is a masterpiece , the movie Jacknife had big shoes to fill . it has same themes as The Deer Hunter , the devastating effects on a person after the Vietnam War . Robert De Niro is in this film , as in The Deer Hunter and is very good here , as is Kathy Baker . but this movie belongs to Ed Harris , who gives a powerful , emotional and impactful performance . the movie is based on a stage play , and there are one or two scenes where that felt obvious to me . by that i just mean that for those one or two scenes it felt like i was watching a stage play . that was not that big a deal , and doesn't really diminish the film . i actually really liked this movie . it's not an epic like The Deer Hunter . they are about similar era and have similar themes , but they are two very different films . i thought The Deer Hunter was great , and i also think this movie was great . it's the acting in this one that makes it so great . for me , Jacknife is a
472679	11423174	112744	10.0	shattering !	this film was amazing . it's basically a story of loss , revenge , redemption and forgiveness . there are two main characters , for both of whom redemption and forgiveness seem impossible . both have suffered loss , but only one seeks revenge . the movie tells the story of how our main characters get to the point of redemption and forgiveness , and it's not how you'd think . at least it wasn't for me . Jack Nicholson puts in what i would call a career performance here , as does David Morse . Sean Penn wrote the script and directed the movie . he did a masterful job in both areas . it's emotionally very powerful , and i shed some tears in some scenes . the only downside i can think of for this film , is for me , there was a bit too much unnecessary nudity . i realise that there had to be some to give . us an idea of one of the main characters , but i think it went a bit overboard . still the rest of the movie is so well done , that i give it a
472619	11423174	347971	10.0	very well done documentary	this is an extremely interesting documentary on jack the ripper and who he really was . the difference is this documentary also has a panel of experts who weigh in on the subject , and give their opinions of who the killer was . when this documentary was made over 20 tears ago , there were were a only a handful of suspects . since that time , there may have been more information and other / more suspects . or the identity of the ripper may have been definitively proved . i don't necessarily think the show was successful in unmasking the killer , but it certainly could have been one of the suspects which they focused on . nonetheless , it is highly informative and entertaining , and well researched . Peter Ustinov as host was a good choice . i enjoyed his dry wit and dark sense of humour . for me , The Secret Identity of Jack the Ripper is a
473319	11423174	399295	10.0	Interpol agent pursues arms dealer	Lord of war is a very effective movie . it is well written , there is a decent back story to the main character via numerous flash backs . Nicolas Cage plays an arms dealer being pursued relentlessly by an interpol agent . ( Ethan Hawke ) I liked the first person narrative with Cage doing the voice-over . it worked well with this picture . a friend of mine complained that it was too preachy , telling us of the evil of guns and showing the deaths of many people particularly young people , to hammer home the point . However i chose to see it as a piece of entertainment , looking beyond what the agenda might have been . if we always look for a hidden agenda in a movie , then we rob ourselves of the experience and we limit ourselves to certain movies and lose out on other perhaps great films . Of course independent of all this we hope the movie is well made and has some entertainment value . Lord of War is one of those movies . it is immensely entertaining , with good performances . i love this movie .
473451	11423174	29843	10.0	brilliant	where to start ? this is one terrific movie . it's funny , has good characters and dialogue . it's also action packed . true , many of the fighting scenes seems a bit corny , but that's probably how they fought back then . back then , they really had to act , unlike today , where some special effect can distract the viewer , so the actor isn't the main focus . also , this was 1938 , and talking pictures hadn't brr around that long . many actors were used to the style of acting in the silent films and just carried that over to the talkies . as for the DVD itself , it has been beautifully restored . the picture is cleans sharp and crisp . anyway , for me " The Adventures of Robin hood is a
473706	11423174	208874	10.0	truly great political intrigue film	The contender is a powerful , riveting movie of political backstabbing and hidden agendas . it is full of suspense and intrigue . a very dramatic film , yet not at all boring , with a great mix of characters and some explosive revelations . this is a very well done movie with some big name actors putting in stellar performances . Jeff Bridges plays president Jackson Evans , who , upon the death of the vice-president is faced with the task of nominating a replacement . Joan Allen plays democratic senator Laine Hanson , the president's nominee . However she must first appear before the confirmation committee and be approved . and this will not prove easy . this is where the movie really gets going . both Bridges and Allen put in solid performances , but it is Gary Oldman who plays committee chair Sheldon Runyon ( a republican ) who is a standout . Oldman gives a powerhouse performance . Christian Slater , Sam Elliott , William Peterson , Saul Rubinek , and Philip Baker Hall , among others also put in terrific performances . this is truly a great movie . but , if you are sensitive about your politics , you might want to avoid this one . otherwise prepare to be entertained for 2 hours .
473517	11423174	397138	10.0	warning : may cause your stomach to explode from too much laughter	this is one of the frickin ' funniest TV shows i have ever seen . i actually had to quit watching because my stomach became too sore from laughing . this is a simple show , about a simple town , with simple people . this show is sprinkled with odd ( at first glance ) characters with various quirks and habits . i will definitely be adding this show to my DVD collection . i urge anyone reading this comment to check it out . i don't know how else to say it - - this show rocks . the writing is very clever and witty , and self deprecating at times . and while the characters may seem odd , they are very endearing . the budget for this show is not high , but it doesn't need a high budget . it gets laughs out of the simple things in life . i highly recommend it , but you will likely only be able to watch a few episodes , before your stomach can't take anymore . For me " Corner Gas is a
473536	11423174	84522	10.0	raunchy low brow cinema at its finest	i'm almost ashamed to admit it , but i loved this movie . it's sick and demented , offensive and political incorrect . but its a riot . it's set in Florida in 1954 . it's basically about a bunch of horn dog teenagers trying to lose their virginity . but there's a lot more going on than just that . there's a lot of double entondres ( not sure if that's the right spelling or not ) here and lots of sexual innuendo and and also sex without any innuendo needed . this is low brow cinema at it's finest . i can see why it's classic though . i laughed my ass off so much i thought i was gonna die . Bob Clark , who directed the original horror classic " Black Christmas " also directed this movie . there are a few serious moments dealing with racism and antisemitism , but mostly it's all about the laughs . if you wanna know what the title " Porky's refers to , you'll have to watch the movie . i have to give this movie for making me laugh my ass off so much .
473309	11423174	1043721	10.0	hysterical	i thought this show was hysterical . yes , it is offensive , crude and vulgar , but so what . the show does seem to make fun of white people ( which i happen to be ) but that's exactly what it is - - fun . people need to get over themselves and stop being so uptight . besides , a lot of the jokes pretty much reflect how many white people behave . if you can't take a joke , then turn off all your TVs and hide yourself in a cave . i don't think the jokes are cruel or mean , either . anyway , i laughed my butt of so much i had tears running down my eyes . David Alan Grier is the star of the show and plays most of the characters . i think he's very funny . i'm gonna try and catch this show every time it's on . it's the only show on The Comedy Network ( here in Canada ) which i have actually found worth watching .
473781	11423174	90605	10.0	more sci-fi / action than horror , but a better movie than the origninal	although Aliens is not the iconic film that alien is , it is still a better film . this film adds a new element by having multiple aliens rather than just the one . it improves upon the look of the creatures , and while maintaining high suspense , adds more action . this film is less character driven than the first . the characters are more developed though and there is more of a group dynamic going on . we have some of the characters fighting each other , as well as the alien threat . the pacing is a bit better in this film . Obviously , this film is not responsible for the rebirth of horror / sci fi , since the original lays claim to that . but it is , in its own right a classic and will be remembered for a long time to come .
472947	11423174	109635	10.0	a riveting tale of sexual role reversal	disclosure is a refreshing film . it takes battle of the sexes and reverses it . here we have a film of role reversal , with the dominant , sexually aggressive woman against the weaker , more submissive male . it works beautifully in this film . i normally can't stand demi moore , but she is brilliantly cast here as the conniving seductress . equally well cast is Micheal douglas as the victim of her seductions . the basic plot is : a high level computer company specialist ( who is married ) finds out he will be working for a former lover . she initiates a sexual encounter between the two , rather forcefully . he resists and puts an end to the encounter . she becomes enraged , and vows revenge . she sues him for sexual harassment . he files a counter claim of sexual harassment against her . and there you have it . the stage is set for plenty of suspense and twists and turns , with a surprising revelation and a terrific plot twist ( which is down to the wire ) to end the film . I own this film and have watched it several times , and i'm riveted each time . out of 10 brilliant
473130	11423174	366551	10.0	brilliantly executed , hysterical road trip comedy	Harold and Kumar is about 2 stoner buddies who decide one night that they have to go to White Castle , a burger chain which they believe make the best burgers in the state . upon finding that the nearest White Castle is no longer in business , they set out a hysterical road trip across the state to find on e that is open . what follows is a series of hysterical misadventures and comedy of errors . this movie is one of the funniest movies ever made . it is easily in my top 3 comedies . brilliantly written , great acting from the 2 leads . the movie flows so smoothly , it's unreal . i was wiping tears from my eyes from laughing from beginning to end . my stomach was so sore it took me days to recover . but the experience was more than worth it . check it out out . you won't be disappointed . 10 +
473874	11423174	105698	10.0	great action , clever writing , great one liners = one great movie	this movie really impressed me . it's clever , well written , and funny . it also has some great , memorable one liners . oh , there's also a ton of action . putting Jean Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren in the same movie really works . add in the beautiful bombshell Ally walker and you have a really , really great film . this is so far my favourite Van Damme film . i really had a blast watching this thing . Van Damme even shows some acting ability . some of the expressions on his face and his deadpan delivery were very funny . Lundgren had quite a few funny one liners , and did OK in the acting dept . Ally Walker was also funny at times . some of the fight scenes are pretty good , too . normally , i don't expect a lot from a Van Damme flick , but i have to give the filmmaker's credit for this one . the crafted a great movie . i can find no fault with this movie . it's just so entertaining . maybe i'm crazy , but " Universal Soldiers " gets a from me .
473677	11423174	430634	10.0	i totally enjoyed it	maybe i'm nuts but i fully enjoyed this movie . the biggest reason for me was just how fun it is . it's written with such wit and sarcasm , which is great . plus , it also shows the athleticism of the girls in gymnastics . it doesn't hurt that the film pokes less than gentle fun at both the judges in that sport and in another well known sport . sure you could say the movie is clichéd , but i thought it worked . it didn't pound you over the head with a sledgehammer to get a message across . i laughed virtually all through . and there's also some hot women , which is a also a good thing . but these women also have acting ability . true , were not talking about an academy award winning movie , but , being funny and able to zing off one liners , is in my mind , no less difficult than being serous . anyway , after all that rambling , i give Stick It a perfect 10 , because i forgot about life's problems and felt good while watching and after .
