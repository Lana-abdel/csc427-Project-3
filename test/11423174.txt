472893	11423174	288477	1.0	beyond pointless ( a true crap fest in every way )	this movie bit the big one , and i mean that in the worst possible way . it starts off really slow and boring . then , they decide to give us a sequence containing buckets of gore , with people dying horrible deaths . bad enough , but . . . the method in which they are dispatched ( pretty much all at the same time ) a mass killing if you will , is beyond the realm of plausibility even for a movie . add to that , the lack of realism in the scene i . e poor makeup effects , with really fake looking blood . what's next ? well , back to being slooooww and borrrring again and bad acting , in fact almost no effort put forth . oh , and really bad dialogue to boot . things did not improve from this point , so i quit watching before the end . i almost felt sorry for the actors , but not quite . they at least picked up a paycheck ( hopefully not too large of one ) from this mess , while the viewer merely loses a good chunk of their life . Julianna Margulies ( a talented actress ) is wasted in this movie , as is Gabrriel Byrne . summing up , we start off with a real yawner , followed by a gore / crap fest . ( ie bad makeup effects , fake looking blood ) next we have another yawn fest , with cheese ( The dialogue hehe ) and , finally a clinic on bad acting . all this for the price of admission or rental to one movie . very impressive . and that's having only seen maybe half the movie . wow . less than
472524	11423174	290747	1.0	a true z movie if there ever was one	wooo-eeee . does this movie suck . i'd say it was a b movie , but it's more like a z movie . from the 30 minutes i was able to suffer through , this is a typical teen slasher movie , except that some crazed swamp monster is doing the killing . almost right off the bat , you have the requisite sex scene between two teenagers . there is some nudity in this scene , which would have been great , except the rest of the movie had to come along and ruin it . and of course one of them gets killed in a particularly grisly way . the characters have less depth than one dimensional cardboard cutouts . but at least this movie is consistent . the music is also of the z quality , completely lame and forgettable . for some strange reason , Matthew Le Nevez , who plays the town's new sheriff , Kyle Williams and presumably , a main character , tries to play his role as if he were in an Oscar calibre movie . this movie isn't even razzie calibre . i wanted to keep watching until it showed the creature , so i could bash the makeup and creature effects as it would only have been fair . alas , i just couldn't take the torture any longer and had to quit watching . i give this stinker a low
473227	11423174	322651	1.0	quick , over here ! . i think i've found it . . . ,	no . sorry . my mistake . i thought for a minute i may have found the plot to this movie . but i don't think think a search party could have any success finding the plot to this movie . there are a few good actors in this movie , but they can't do anything to make it better . i think the movie dragged their performances down with it . as a a result , you won't find much in the way of acting here . and the dialogue . wow . awful , truly awful . i suspect they were going for something profound here , but they fell short by a long shot . this thing is really tedious . i think this is a case where they should have scrapped this thing before it was done , or at least not released it . i don't want to say it's bad , but it sure is the opposite of good . this is how i feel about the movie , and others may feel differently . all i know is , it sure didn't do it for me . for me , Dream Warrior is a / 10 movie .
472928	11423174	120177	1.0	atrocious	boy , what a letdown this movie was . compared to the animated series , this doesn't even rate . it's all of the place , in terms of tone and story . the acting is pretty bad from all concerned . i felt embarrassed for everybody involved . i found the story lacking in any real excitement . plus , for this character , there should have been a much more compelling characterization . i know it's an origin story , but i think they could have done a lot more with it . it doesn't make much sense , and i couldn't give a lick about any of the characters . the whole thing is really just nonsense . it's 94 minutes i'll never get back . for me , Spawn is a a dismal
473325	11423174	327162	1.0	awful awful movie that takes its name from the original	how to start . how about abysmal , boring , a complete train wreck ? that barely touches the surface when describing this mess . this movie is dreary , and depressing , to say the least . painfully torturous to watch . but for some reason , i Sat through it all . the big problem was the writing which was pedantic at best . then there is the acting ; sub par from some usually reliable actors . one big problem was that they tried to make it funny . i haven't seen the original yet , but i do know it was played as a drama , not a comedy . and i'm guessing it works much more effectively . i also suspect the casting decisions were smarter for the original . the actors were clearly miscast for this mess . they did not look comfortable at all . plainly stated , this movie could not have been very faithful to its source material and that is its failing . But in that case it would have been the exact same movie as the original . what i'm really saying is that this movie was not necessary . i'm sure the movie going public wasn't clamoring for it . bottom there are many crappy movies out there to avoid , and this is one of them .
473131	11423174	247745	1.0	If it comes down to this movie , or a rectal exam , gimme the rectal exam , baby ! ! !	how many ways can you say awful ? too many to list here . somehow i have to find a way to get in the minimum words required by IMDb . if you read my summary , you know already know that a rectal exam is much more fun and entertaining than this piece of afterbirth . this movie is below the intellect of the slowest 3 year old . absolutely atrocious to the nth degree . it blew chunks all over my house . i hope i get the stains out before before it sets . look , there is nothing in this world you could do which would be less amusing and pleasurable than this stink bomb . route canals , invasive surgery , having your fingernails and toenails pulled out with pliers , eating a bucket of broken glass and of course the always popular-rectal exam . take your pick . me i'd go for the rectal exam . trust me , you'll be aching with desire to bend over and feel that rubber glove after this excruciatingly agonizing excuse of a movie . this one is too low to rate
473471	11423174	417056	1.0	i can't believe i swallowed the same booger for nearly 30 min .	where to start ? virtually no plot . bad acting , bad taste . lots of t & a . nude lesbian scenes . even that can not salvage this booger . not much else . Paris Hilton is in this . i still say she can act , given the right material , but the road to becoming a serious ( or at least respected ) actress does not begin with this phlegm . or maybe she doesn't want to become a serious actress . in which case , she is headed in the right direction . i may have managed to get through half an hour of this thing , before i said , screw it , there must be something else to do . i am not a prude and have low standards ( or is that high standards ? - - i can never remember ) when it comes to things such as bad taste , but this was beyond my capacity . mostly because it just not relevant . but then neither was the rest of the movie . Most of the actresses in this sludge probably don't have the acting ability to make it in porn movies . anyway , i think i met the required 10 lines , so i'll leave it at that . but don't say i didn't warn you . a big fat
472692	11423174	370032	1.0	muddled and incoherent	talk about a pointless movie . i mean , i love Milla as much as the next guy , but even she can't save this disaster . she looks hot and she's in great shape . she's just in the wrong movie . i could only take so much of her character , V ( Short for Violet ) going up against increasingly overwhelming odds time after time and emerging with barely a scrape . and that's mostly all this movie is , in my mind : a collection of action / fight sequences , with pretty much no coherent plot . i didn't particularly like Either of the first two Resident Evil movies , but this is worse than both of them . i don't mind saying i was bored out of my skull . even the action sequences become boring , once you see the same thing over and over again . talk about a train wreck . this movie really made my head hurt . i'm sorry i lost 94 minutes of my life for this thing . check out Resident Evil : Extinction ( on the big screen ) instead . anyway , for me Ultraviolet is a definite
473459	11423174	67116	1.0	another bore fest masquerading as a movie	i must be seeing things . i swear this movie has a rating of 7 . 9 . but that can't be right . that would mean it is actually a good movie . so i guess the 7 . 9 is out of a possible 100 . seriously , The French Connection is one long bore . Gene Hackman is a gifted actor , but even he can't save this mess . William ( i have yet to make a decent film ) Friedkin shows once again how to make any action sequence seem slower than molasses . i know people rave about this guy , but i have to wonder if they just mimic what they may have heard someone else say . i blame the first person who ever saw this movie and described the experience in a positive light . honestly , if i had known what i was in for , i would gladly have hacked off all my limbs and poured salt in the wounds instead . that would have made for a much more pleasurable experience . and just in case you don't know what the movie is about , here's a brief synopsis : cop movie with bad dialogue , punctuated by boring action sequences , followed by more bad dialogue and on and on . the writers should not escape notice for their part in this disaster . Clearly , the script was lost somewhere along the way . Right after the beginning credits rolled . up until that point , it held promise . if you enjoy being bored to tears for an extended length of time , i recommend a double bill-this movie and another bore fest-To Live and Die in L . A .
473414	11423174	267679	1.0	truly painful to watch , unless you're into unintentional bad acting	as disaster movies , this is pretty awful . poor acting all around , especially from the woman who played the town mayor . judging by her performance , i'm guessing she thought she was in a comedy . nobody did a good job in their roles , except maybe John Schnieder , who was not too bad and Michelle Greene was okay . as for the rest , there isn't a convincing one in the lot . i was so embarrassed for them all . but to be fair , some of the dialogue they were given is atrocious . not much thought went into this film . 1 positive though is that the lightning scenes were done well , and were almost impressive at times . the story itself moves way too slow , with pointless scene after pointless scene . this movie is not worth your time , unless you want to laugh at bad acting . the movie is supposed to be serious , and is not played for camp value , at all , and that is the real disaster .
473564	11423174	416315	2.0	predictable ( yawn ) so called thriller based loosely on factual events	i saw Wolf Creek awhile ago and decided it was time to write a review on it . first off , it reminds me of Hostel , mainly because it was more brutal than necessary , in my opinion . there isn't as much gore as Hostel , but what gore there was , was taken to extreme in some scenes . it was supposedly based on a true story , but that means nothing in modern movies . the plot was nothing new , very predictable , as was much of the outcome . the one thing wolf creek has going for it is that there is some character development and so you are given the chance to feel for the characters when they are in jeopardy . i did care about what happened to the characters both from the character development and the acting which i thought was quite good . unfortunately , the same cannot be said for the rest of the movie . it has nothing new , no scares , just disgust more than anything . it is not as bad as Hostel , but for me , that's not saying much . if you must watch this movie , you should find a cheap place to rent it . but i wouldn't buy it . it's not worth it . lame .
473613	11423174	303816	3.0	Roth's pre Hostel effort crap , but less crap than Hostel	Cabin Fever is the first feature film directed by Eli Roth . Roth and Randy Pearlstein co wrote the script from a story by Roth . this a zombie film , which owes a lot to George Romero and his earlier " living dead movies " , and to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacrenot to mention Sam Ramie's " Evil Dead " . there is nothing original here , and the story is not compelling . the acting is about par with this genre , it's just that the story fails . we have pretty much seen this movie before and better made . having said that , after having achieved commercial , if not artistic success from this movie , Roth decided he was a director and came out with the abysmally atrocious , mean spirited , pointless ( though much more ambitious ) crap fest Hostel . Roth should have quit while he was behind . Cabin Fever is not a good film , however compared to Hostel it is a work of art . I hope somebody ( preferably a psychiatrist ) convinces this guy that film-making is the wrong career choice . as for Cabin fever , a weak for not being as abysmal as Hostel .
473433	11423174	67727	3.0	if you can get through the first 50 minutes or so . . .	this is one slow movie . it's about a family who gets murdered , and their blind daughter eventually discovers they are murdered and tries to get help , while avoiding being killed . there is almost nothing happening for the 1st 50 minutes or , and then things pick up , but nit much . the killer is never revealed until the end , and the end is pretty anticlimactic . the killings seem random , but if you pay close attention from the beginning , the killer may have what he perceives as motive , though it's very murky and twisted . the one good thong about this movie is Mia Farrow , who is very effective as the blind woman who terrified and alone . other than that , though , i wasn't very impressed . for me , See No Evil is a
472902	11423174	100828	3.0	a sequel to 1974's Chinatown , lacking the same spark and imagination	this movie is the sequel to 1974's Chinatown . Jack Nicholson directed this film and stars again as Jake Gittes . Robert Towne wrote the script and the movie is based on characters created by him . it is hard not to compare this movie to its predecessor and comparisons are inevitable . so here goes . First off this movie plods along at a snail's pace . there doesn't seem to be a clear direction . Also , Gittes seems less likable this time around . the surrounding characters seem to lack any real imagination , as do the situations . put simply , there is no spark . and the femme fatalle angle , which worked so well in the original , doesn't work here . but then who could fill the shoes of the mega star charismatic actress Faye Dunnaway ? no-one . so , the femme in this case is less fatalle . the script is also lacking in imagination , giving the director ( Nicholson ) less to work with . you will be bored nearly to tears here . a disappointing followup to Chinatown . , as a stand alone film , however-also disappointing . this movie is not quite awful , but not quite good either . not recommended .
472713	11423174	284303	3.0	not good	hmmm , what to say about this movie . very , very low budget . CGI that looks very shiny and nice , but completely fake . for most of the movie , nothing happens , except a lot of talking . when the shark finally makes an appearance , it is underwhelming . it does not look that menacing . there is zero tension in the movie . there are only 2 good things in this movie . one is that the acting , surprisingly , is not that bad . and 2 , there are some deep underwater scenes showing some very unique and beautiful creatures . they are very obviously CGI , but they look very pretty , nonetheless . i sat trough the whole movie to see the shark . i wish i hadn't . 60 minutes of boredom for a few minutes of shark footage is not worth it . it's obvious they had zero budget , so they shouldn't have attempted this type of movie . i'll give it
473221	11423174	88912	3.0	poorly conceived and executed	weird . this is a TV movie , yet the rating on the box says it's rated R . there's nothing in the movie that would remotely qualify for an R rating . aside from that , though , the movie is very slow and pointless . i mean the idea was good , but nothing was done with the storyline . it just wasn't developed . it's mildly creepy , and the acting is actually quite good , better than the movie deserves . i don't see myself watching it again anytime soon , if ever . there have been other movies dealing with the same concept which are better made than this one . i haven't seen too many Wes Craven Films , so i can't really compare it to any of his others . as for this movie itself though , i think it is poorly conceived and poorly executed . for me , i can't give Chiller a higher rating than
473375	11423174	38284	3.0	poor western	this western / musical / comedy is not one of the best of the genre i have seen . i found it much too slow . it just plodded along to the inevitable end . i also found it disjointed . i couldn't wait for it to be over . Randolph Scott is the headliner here , and Lloyd Bridges also stars . but for my money money Edgar Buchanan is the best of the bunch . Buchanan appeared in many westerns in his day , many times providing comic relief , as he does in this picture . i also liked Ann Dvorak as Rita . otherwise , though , i can't think of much to recommend this movie . the movie is based on a novel by Ernest Haycock , who also wrote the novel Stagecoach , which was mad into a movie of the same name in 1939 , and remade in 1966 and again in 1986 . The 1939 version of Stagecoach , is in my mind , one of the best movies ever made . anyway . as for Abilene town , my vote is a
473437	11423174	118604	4.0	if you liked An American Werewolf in London , . . . ( )	you will likely be sorely disappointed by this sequel that's not a sequel . AWIL is a classic . but this movie is about as far from being a classic as you can get . what a joke . special effects that aren't very special , horrible dialogue , non acting . and a laughably ridiculous subplot quickly and unconvincingly , ( not to mention fleeting ) tacked on with about a third of the movie left . did i mention the story is less then lame . there's no way this was supposed to be serious horror movie , yet it's to stupid to be funny in any good way . the rating it currently has ( ) is too generous if you ask me . my rating for An American Werewolf in Paris : a
473821	11423174	433588	4.0	very bleak	this is an ' inspired by true events ' movie . it's a bleak movie , to be blunt about it . it's about a woman who had done nothing but lie cheat and steal her whole life . as a result her and her young daughter live a life on the run from the law . i found this movie slow and boring for the most part . it doesn't have a happy ending , ( at least to me it doesn't ) like some movies of this genre have . and it doesn't resolve anything or tie up any loose ends , like i hoped it would . i only kept watching for two reasons . one was the hope that there might be a happy ending . tow was that the acting was pretty decent . so , basically the movie is only worth watching for the performances . as a result , my vote for Lies My Mother Told Me is a
473818	11423174	358349	4.0	strictly cheap laughs and lame story	talk about disappointing . this sequel has none of the heart of the original . the first one was silly , but at least it had a semblance of story , and the laughs were honest . here , it's all about the cheap laughs . this movie is slow and boring , with a lame story . if it didn't go direct to video , it should have . Anthony Anderson is in this one , and he can usually be counted on for some good laughs , but he has nothing to work with here . this is case where they should just have stuck with the original , or at least put some more thought into the sequel . it feels rushed , but then it was , considering it came out merely a year later than the first one . Agent Cody Banks 2 : Destination London gets a from me .
473786	11423174	95924	4.0	this movie barely has a . . . Pulse ( 1988 )	OK , quick synopsis . electricity in people's houses starts going haywire . it starts whispering to people , driving them insane . it then takes over their houses , turning them into death traps and murdering them . notice i said murder , not kill . this is because the deaths are deliberate , not accidental . r-i-i-i-ght . obviously the whole idea is ludicrous . now , the implausibility of the basic premise could be somewhat forgiven if there were any reason or explanation given for what is happening , but alas , there isn't . no attempt is even made to explain the events . they just happen and that is a large problem . even a lame attempt would be better than none . and don't get me started on the ending . oh what the heck . the ending - makes no sense at all . the movie basically just ends . no loose ends are tied up . but there were some positives . the acting was decent , given that the actors had so little to work with . and there were some tense moments . not the worst movie ever made just not a good one . all in all , an empty unsatisfying experience . a low
472759	11423174	107090	4.0	generic crime thriller with out the thrills	to me , this is just a standard suspense thriller / crime drama . although , in reality , it isn't really thrilling or suspenseful . in fact , it could be a TV episode from a crime show . except for the bit of nudity . you have your usual cast of characters , criminals looking for something , murders , witnesses , plot twists that aren't . i like Marlee Matlin and D . B . Sweeney , but i didn't sense any chemistry between them . the story itself is , like i said , fairly generic , and uninvolving , with a few things that don't add up . in other words , logic gaps . to be fair there are a few tense moments , adding up to maybe five minutes or so of the total running time . otherwise , it's slow and yawn inducing . for me , Hear no Evil is a
472921	11423174	212720	4.0	pretty good visual style , but not too much else , in my mind	this movie falls into the same category as Blade Runner in my opinion . i mean it looks good visually , but there isn't much substance . i think so much more could have been done with not only the movie in general but also with the characters . speaking of characters , Jude Law's character struck me as just being nonsensical . i also thought movie was way too long , clocking in at nearly 2 and a half hours . think they could have streamlined the script and made it more economical . but that's just me . plus , i was pretty depressed after watching this movie . other than it's visual style , i don't see a lot of merit here . anyway for me , " Artificial Intelligence : AI " gets a
472549	11423174	102803	4.0	should be rated at least PG-13	the rating on this movie is on this site . but it's not as good as i had expected or hoped . that rating is about 2 stars too high for me . for one thing , i found it too insubstantial , with a pretty weak story . the potential was there , but it just wasn't realized . there also existed the possibility of some humour in the movie , but that doesn't really develop either . it's also slow , with only intermittent scenes of action . there's almost no character development . as a matter of a fact , there were a few characters that had almost nothing to do . this movie runs about 104 minutes without end credits , but i had to stop it , to break up the monotony . the American and Canadian rating on this movie is PG , but i think it should be at least PG-13 . i think it's a bit too intense for any under 13 , but that's just me . nevertheless , parents should use their discretion . my vote for The Rocketeer is a
472627	11423174	988047	4.0	underwhelming	talk about high hopes being dashed . seeing the trailers for this film starring Don Cheadle , i was convinced it would be a great movie . sadly , i found it boring , predictable , muddled , pointless . I like Don Cheadle a lot . but i think he made a bad decision to star in this movie . Guy Pierce , Neil McDonough , and Jeff Daniels co star . a case of a great cast being wasted , except for guy Pierce , who i was impressed with . otherwise , this movie is just filled with despair and no hope . it's got a fairly high rating of , which i would say is way , way too generous . maybe i just wasn't in the right mood or frame of mind for this movie . anyway , for me , Traitor is a
472714	11423174	102202	4.0	not as good as number 1 , ( or 2 and 3 , for that matter )	this sequel is nowhere near as good as the original . there is lots of blood in this one , courtesy of the fight scenes . , which is a good thing . the fight scenes themselves aren't too bad . however , if found the plot to be lame and uninteresting . this martial arts movie did not really engage my interest very much . this movie lacks the depth ( i , i said depth and martial arts movie in the same sentence ) of the first film and even the following two sequels . the worst part of the experience is the song selections and choice of band . who picks this crap . these guy don't even rate as flea bag bar band . and the songs are pathetic . the only good things in this movie are Sasha Mitchell , who makes a credible hero and Dennis Chan , who plays the wise oriental sidekick . i suppose i could eke out a for this movie , since it is watchable , but the music just sucks so damn bad , i have to give " Kickboxer 2 "
472615	11423174	82497	4.0	interesting concept , but the movie is not interesting	this movie kinda reminded me of the classic short story The Monkey's Paw , only it isn't as good . it's too long for one thing , and too slow . the concept is interesting , but to me the execution of it goes wrong somewhere . i did find it interesting that Oliver Stone wrote the screenplay and directed the movie . there is nothing political about the movie . this doesn't mean the movie is good of course , but it is an interesting aside , nonetheless . Michael Caine is the lead , and and does an OK job , but the material is not really compelling or even mildly interesting . i watched it for awhile and got bored , so i started talking on the phone with a friend while i continued watching halfheartedly . having said all that , i don't think it is an awful movie , it's just not very interesting . by the way , this movie is part of the Twisted terror Collection , and is also contained in the box set ( along with five other titles ) of the same name . anyway , my vote for the hand is a
472956	11423174	325234	5.0	' mockumentary ' on parking enforcers	here we have a ' mockumentary ' ( fake documentary ) on the people who enforce the parking laws . you know who i mean . you leave your car , and come back to it , only to find that nice little piece of paper on it . you know the 1 that says you have to pay a fine because you parked 30 seconds too long at the metre , or you parked half an inch to far from the curb . well the movie is about the people who put those nice pieces of paper on the windshield , i person in particular . this person's name is Grant , and Grant is of the opinion that his job is very important . it is a public service , and to hear him talk about it , akin to curing disease . they even have a ' guru'of parking enforcement named Murray which they revere very highly , like a god . they even spout philosophical drivel from the man himself . this movie should be funny , but it isn't . it is mildly amusing ( and i do mean mildly ) at best . there is nothing profound in this movie , that i can see . i wouldn't recommend renting it , but if you see it on TV , and you have nothing else to do , it will serve as a diversion for around 90 minutes . it is less than 90 minutes , and it does go by quickly , so that is a plus . others may find some this movie hysterical and even ' deep'but for me , it is average entertainment at best . ' my vote for ' The Delicate art of Parking ' ?
473926	11423174	470055	5.0	it was a bit different than the first one , but i didn't find it any better or worse	after watching this sequel ( which has nothing to do with the first ) to the first Open Water , i'm not sure what to think . like the first movie , this one also has the ' based on true events ' . and again i think it is plausible that events happened the way the movie shows . either way , i liked some things about , the movie but some things i didn't like . i liked the fact that we get into the meat of the story quicker this time . also , although this one also involves people being left adrift out at sea , the circumstances which lead up to things are different . there are also more people involved . to me , the acting didn't really stand out , with one exception . that would be Susan May Pratt . i found her very believable as someone who was distraught over what had happened . anyway , this time , there are six friends involved . this makes for an interesting dynamic and some genuine tension . you also don't know who , if anyone will survive . those are the good things about it . as for what i didn't like , i thought the movie dragged a bit at times . it is about 15 minutes longer , which i felt was too long . i'm gonna give Open water 2 : Adrift the same rating as the first Open Water , which would be
473678	11423174	398808	5.0	less of the fantasy element than i'd hoped for ( and not a movie for young kids )	i was disappointed in this movie . it thought there would be more of a fantasy element to it , but that was just a very small part of the movie . most of the movie was nothing spectacular , with very little story or character development . i just felt they could have done more with the material . that's not to say that it's bad movie , because it isn't . the movie takes a dark turn towards the latter half , and becomes heartbreaking . i don't think it would be suitable for really young kids , because there are some pretty serious themes to it , and because it takes such a dark turn . there's nothing really offensive though , but parents should really use their discretion . for me , i give Bridge to Terabithia a
472755	11423174	479968	5.0	unless you're really bored , i wouldn't bother to pick up	to me , this movie is not great . the premise is of course , absurd , but i knew that going in , so that's not really the problem . the problem is , the movie itself doesn't generate much in the way of suspense or thrills . there's a subplot thrown in that doesn't really have a point . Shannon Sossamon is OK in her role , but not great . however , i didn't buy Ed Burns in his role as a cop , in the slightest . Margaret Cho has what amounts to a cameo as a cop . thankfully it was just a cameo , because i think she was miscast . i also thought the ending was a bit too anti climatic . actually the whole movie was anti climatic . if you just want to kill some time an a lazy afternoon , when you have nothing else to do , it's ' alright . otherwise , though , it's nothing special . not terrible , but not really good either . for me , One Missed Call is a
473397	11423174	55277	5.0	a bit too mellow	while i will say this movie is certainly family friendly , i didn't really like it all that much . i felt it was too long and slow . i think it could have been 30 minutes shorter without missing anything important . the acting is good , but i found the characters bland and uninteresting . Hayley Mills is is a decent enough actress , and it must be hard for one actor to play twins convincingly , which Mills does . but the movie is a bit too mellow for my tastes . I did like Maureen O'Hara as the mother . she stood out from the rest . Brian Keith was also good as the father . this is definitely a movie the whole family can watch . i did think it was a bit mellow , but to be fair there were a few fun scenes , and some catchy songs . my vote for The Parent trap is a
473520	11423174	94074	5.0	an improvement over Superman III	this movie had a better storyline than number three . ( actually there's two story lines ) . it isn't as silly either . the problem though , lies how cheaply made it is . the special effects , if you can call them that , are laughable . the acting also seems to suffer here . it seems the actors knew they were in a a poorly done movie , so they may as well put as little effort as possible into their performances . frankly , to me , most of the actors look embarrassed to be there . i will say that choice of villain was good , but the character himself is too over the top for me . plus , the fight scenes are way too protracted . the movie does also get a bit sappy at times , which i guess you can expect given its subject matter . still , it was a bit too much for me . however , despite its problems , i like this movie more than number three . for me , Superman IV is a
473303	11423174	82495	5.0	lacklustre sequel	pretty much blah-is how to describe this movie . i found it even slower , than the original ( boring in fact ) . it's also not scary or even creepy . plus , there are so many things that are preposterous about it all , it's hard to know where to begin . if the movie wasn't so boring , a lot of the absurdities could be forgiven or maybe not even noticed . not so in this movie . i do think that the acting was a bit better though . then again that's not saying much . i really noticed the low budget in this one , which is ironic , considering i think it had a bigger budget than the original . i have seen a lot of abysmal movies , and this does not fall into that category . i did find it lacklustre , though . oh , yeah , there is some nudity in this one , but only one or two scenes . there is is only one scene with the F-word . otherwise , the language isn't that bad . anyway , the most i can give Halloween II is a
473310	11423174	839930	5.0	just be yourself ( )	that seems to be the overriding theme in this animated film . young kids will probably like it due to the bright colours and loud noise . the message is good , but the movie itself is not that special . it is obviously family friendly , as there's nothing objectionable i can think of . so parents . can be pretty confident they can set their kids down in front of this by themselves with no worries . the CG animation is pretty good , and i liked the voice talent . it plods along pretty slowly though to its inevitable conclusion . still , it's not a horrible movie by any stretch . and it's less than 80 minutes , so that's a good thing . and it's a really positive movie . for me , The Nutty Professor ( 2008 ) is a
473795	11423174	157583	5.0	i found the book riveting , the movie - - not so much	after watching this movie , i was a bit disappointed . i mean , the movie was OK , but it doesn't compare to the book , which i found riveting . the movie is set During WWII , and is basically about the British code breakers who were continually trying to break the code of the Enigma machine , which is how the Germans communicated with each other . there is some fine acting here , by Dougray Scott , Kate Winslet , Saffron Burrows and Jeremy Northam , and many others . there a few moments of tension and suspense , but mostly the movie is all about the drama . there is also a love story angle here . this is not some big Hollywood blockbuster version of events . this is a small , independent film . it is based on true events , and i believe it is probably fairly accurate . it's taken from the book by Robert Harris . i highly recommend the book , but if you read it first you , will likely be disappointed in the movie . my vote for Enigma :
473872	11423174	414951	5.0	not what i expected	this movie is not what i expected . it wasn't horrible but i didn't think it was great either . i found most of the movie way too depressing and it didn't seem to have a point . it gets a bit better toward the end , but i still found it lacking . i think it tried too hard to be profound , and for me , it didn't succeed . i also found the acting not that great , but it also got better toward the end . i think many critics seem to think that the more depressing a movie is , the better it is . or at least many seem to give ratings that reflect that . to me , that doesn't make sense . but the opposite also seems true ( though not always ) . if a movie is light hearted and entertaining it gets a lower rating because there is not some deep profound meaning behind it . i mentioned that i didn't see the point to this movie . i say that because it seemed liked it was trying to be deep and meaningful . if that is a movies intent , then it should more clearly reflect that . and in this case , it doesn't seem to . For me " The Quiet " is a
473315	11423174	338094	6.0	decent family fare	this Eddie Murphy movie is actually pretty good . it's funny , spooky and mysterious . the title pretty much says what it's about . basically , Murphy's character and his family are drawn into a mystery involving an old , obviously haunted mansion . i thought Jennifer Tilly was very funny here . it's PG rated movie , so it's suitable for most viewers . there maybe a few scenes a bit too intense for very young viewers . other than that , it's clean viewing entertainment . it's got a current low rating of 4 . 8 , which i don't happen to agree with at all . it may not be Eddie Murphy's finest hour , but so what . it's a decent family movie that kids and most adults should enjoy too . my rating for The Haunted mansion is
472912	11423174	422774	6.0	a bit funnier than Are We There yet ?	i thought this sequel to Are We There Yet was pretty good . it's a bit funnier . it's based on the classic movie Mr . Blandings builds his dream House , but it also has a lot of the Money Pit thrown in . John C . McGinley is very funny in his role . i don't want to say what that role is , because that would be spoiling things . but trust me , he's pretty funny . as with the first movie , this one is predictable , so there's no surprise how it will end . there's a bit of innuendo here , but no bad language . i'm surprised at the low rating ( ) which in my mind is nowhere near fair . for me , this is a movie that is pretty much good for the whole family . i give Are We Done Yet ? a
473896	11423174	297120	6.0	not a bad sequel but way too long ( nearly 3 hours )	it's been a little while since i've seen this sequel to the 1984 original . however , i do remember that i really liked the girl who played the grown up version of Charlie . i thought she did well in the role . there's a lot more excitement in this one , i believe . it's much higher energy . again , the acting is serviceable , though the plot seems sillier than it did in the first movie . also , clocking in at nearly 3 hours running time is a real negative here . i think the story could have been told in much less time than that . they certainly could have shaved off an hour . but as sequels go ( other than the long running time ) this movie is not half bad . for me , Fire Starter 2 : Rekindled is a
472569	11423174	64780	6.0	may big names stars of Westerns ( and other genres ) past	this is a pretty decent western with some good comic moments . it features many famous names of the genre , such as Walter Brennan , Jack Elam , Edgar Buchanan , Gypsy Lee Rose , Pat O'Brien and Ricky Nelson . all had previously been in earlier westerns and here were in the twilight of their careers . i won't give away the plot , but the title certainly fits the movie and the characters . the actors themselves aren't over the hill , even though their characters may be . in fact , they all put in good performances , though Jack Elam was the best of the bunch , in my mind . one thing about the movie i should mention is that it actually felt more like a TV episode than a movie . the version i watched was only 70 minutes . still , it is an entertaining diversion . for me , The Over the Hill Gang is a
472851	11423174	89173	6.0	part 5 ( )	this fifth entry in the series has an interesting twist that is hinted subtly ( or maybe not subtly ) a few times throughout the movie . i liked the ending to part 4 : The Final Chapter , but i liked this ending even more . otherwise , there's not much straying from the familiar formula mined in the last 4 . masked psycho slaughters several people for no apparent reason . some of the characters in this one are just plain unlikable , or stupid . once again the acting is nothing special , but then again , that's to be expected when your characters are merely plot devices , and nothing more . for me , this movie wasn't as good as the fourth . my vote for Friday the 13th-Part 5 : A new Beginning is a
473666	11423174	305396	6.0	basically an extension of the Crocodile Hunter series	this is basically just an extension of the Crocodile Hunter TV series . it has it's amusing moments , and is entertaining enough , but it's not much more than a fluff piece . the plot is pretty weak , and most of the characters have no depth or development . most of the movie seems like just a showcase for Irwin's antics . plus , after about the 70 minute mark , it seems to lose any steam that it did have . still Steve Irwin and his wife Terri ( playing themselves ) are both likable characters , and Steve's antics are amusing . even in the movie , it's not hard to see their passion for wildlife . the message about how we should love and respect the animals on the planet , since many of them were here before us , and we are encroaching on their habitat , is not at all heavy handed or preachy . for me , Crocodile Hunter : Collision Course is a
473373	11423174	25939	6.0	mystery / western	this is a pretty good western . but it's not just a western . it's also a mystery . actually it's probably more of a mystery than a western . it's short clocking in at around 65 minutes , but it's a pretty good movie . it stars Randolph Scott , Anne Sheridan , Kathleen Burke , Florence Roberts , Howard Wilson , Charles ' Chic ' Sale , Mrs . Leslie carter , George F . Marion , among others . i thought it was well done . it had a nice atmosphere , and wasn't wholly predictable . the acting was good by all concerned , and the story was interesting , but similar to another western i remember seeing . though i can't recall weather this movie came out before that one or not . by similar story , i don't mean the general outline and formula that most westerns follow . i mean that some of the story details and specifics are similar . regardless , i liked it . for me , The Fighting Westerner is a
472743	11423174	104029	6.0	creative and inventive , but not quite what i expected	i'll try not to give too much away , plot wise with this movie . but it basically involves the possibility of eternal life , ( sort of ) and there are some biblical parallels as well . there's a lesson in here that contains the old cliché , " be careful what you wish for " you may get what you want ( or thought you wanted ) but nothing is for free , and there are sacrifices . the movie is low budget and i don't mean that as a criticism . in some scenes , the movie actually works better as a result . overall , though i didn't like the movie as much as i thought i would . i'd had heard of it before , and had high expectations . i guess i though it would be more profound than it was . it has its moments , to be sure . it's not boring by any means , but it just has less of an impact than i hoped . it's directed and written by Guillermo del Toro , who also directed Hell Boy , Blade 2 and Pan's Labyrinth . as for " Cronos " it certainly is unique with a different twist on an old genre . for me , Cronos is a
472981	11423174	486655	6.0	decent fantasy adventure movie	this fantasy adventure movie is not as good as i'd hoped , but it's still pretty good . it does plod along though for the fist 60 minutes or so , then it pickup for about 20 minutes . from there it slows down , but not as slow as it had been previously . the last 30 minutes are quite good , in my opinion . things really pick up here , with some great action and excitement . this movie has some original ideas in it , but it also borrows from other movies . there are some pretty big name actors in this one . and all put in terrific performances . Robert De Niro in particular , gets to have the most fun with his role , i think . he really lets loose . anyway , this movie definitely has its good moments . for me , Stardust is a
473082	11423174	119363	6.0	has its good moments	this based on a true story movie is all right , i suppose . it involves a ban robber and his wife / partner , and the FBI as they try and stop him . problem is , he wears a good disguise and thanks to his wife ( the brains behind the outfit ) very organized . eventually the bank robberies escalate into shootings , and the move ends on a tragic , sad note . Unlike another In the Line of Duty movie , The FBI Murders , this one is not as brutally violent . it also moves a lot slower . the criminals in this one are shown to be more sympathetic . whether that's accurate to the real story , i don't know . Bruce Campbell ( The Evil Dead Trilogy ) and Lori Loughlin ( TV's Full ) House star as the husband and wife . both are decent enough . Loughlin was actually pretty good , transcending her all American girl image from Full House . i'd give this movie a
473391	11423174	43959	7.0	pretty good western	i thought this was a pretty good western . it contains most of the elements western contain , stagecoaches , robbers , and gunfights . and , there is the beautiful woman ( Susan Hayward ) and the man ( Tyrone power ) she is unwittingly thrown together with in a fight to survive . there is not a lot of action , in this particular western , but that's OK . the dramatic parts are well done , and the acting is very good . Power and Hayward acquit themselves quite well do quite well here , but Hugh Marlowe is really good as the chief Villain . Dean Jagger , Jack Elam and George Tobias also play villains with Jack Elam very strong here . there is some great chemistry / tension between Power and Hayward . as most western go this one follows the formula , so it's fairly easy to predict how thing will go . i will say , though , that the ending went a bit different than i had expected . overall , an enjoyable 86 minutes or so
473542	11423174	444682	7.0	heavy on form , light on substance	this supernatural movie was decent enough , i guess . i'd call it a supernatural thriller , but it isn't really thrilling . there's zero tension or suspense . it's heavy on form , but light on substance . and there is really nothing new here . there are a couple of minor plot twists , but most people will probably see it coming a mile away . but the news into all bad . the movie moves along at a good clip , and it's certainly not boring . i also thought it was nice to see Hilary portray a more mature , conservative character and she does what she can with her character . the only problem is , the character is hardly developed at all . this is unfortunate , since she is the main character . AnnaSophia Robb is mesmerizing in her role . the rest of the performances are all decent enough . the movie itself is far from being bad . it's pretty decent , but not great . i think it's entertaining enough . my vote for The Reaping :
473412	11423174	87980	7.0	a moving portrayal of one man's journey of self discovery	The Razor's Edge is the story of a man who could have had a life of wealth , but decided he wanted more . he goes on a journey of self discovery and enlightenment . the movie based on the novel by W . Somerset Maugham ( The Painted Veil ) and the screenplay is co-written by John Byrum and Bill Murray . Murray is also the main character in the film . The story begins during the time of the 1st world war . Larry Darrel ( Murray ) goes off to fight in the war . the war has taken its toll on him emotionally and when he returns home he is a different man . and so he leaves for Paris and his journey of discovery begins . This movie is very dramatic , sedate at times , and hard to get through . it is at times very poignant and sombre . but it does have a message . sometimes we think we have everything , when in fact we have nothing . the most wealthy person may have little or no money , but can be rich , nonetheless . normally i don't go for the kinds of movies that have a moral to them . and that is because they usually hit you over the head repeatedly with the message . The Razor's Edge isn't that kind of film . everything about the film is subtle , so you really just come to you own conclusions . this is not a comedy , in fact if it were a play , it would be a tragedy . Bill Murray puts in a fine dramatic performance . Theresa Russel ( Wild things , Kafka ) Catherine Hicks ( 7th Heaven ) Denholm Elliot ( Raiders of the Lost Ark ) among others put in very good supporting performances . i would not recommend this movie to everyone . if you like your viewing experience to be filled with action , this is not your movie . if your tastes run more to the sublime , you will like this movie . i give this movie a strong
473333	11423174	83943	7.0	entertaining and tension filled	this was a pretty entertaining movie . i thought it was well paced , even the dramatic scenes . it's set during the cold war , when The Soviet Union and the U . S had high tensions between them . Clint Eastwood is good as a former American fighter pilot who still has flashbacks from Vietnam and hasn't flown for years . he is enlisted to steal a state of the art Russian jet so the U . S . can study its capabilities and make sure they don't fall behind in their Technology . Eastwood is good as the hero , and he also directed the picture . there's some great tension and suspenseful moments here . the flying sequences were really good at times . at other times , they are dated and don't look very realistic . still , the movie is fun , and i like the story . for me , Firefox is a
473529	11423174	446809	7.0	starts off slow , becomes interesting	starting off , i was not impressed with this reality series . the first episode starts off slower than molasses uphill in January . eventually it picks up . the second episode is much better , as we get into the action much quicker . the show is interesting , showing what the crab fishermen go through and how grueling it is . it also shows how dangerous it is . apparently there is an almost 100 percent injury rate and a very strong risk of death or permanent injury . it is obviously very dangerous . however , some of these crab fishermen could make enough money in weeks or less to live for an entire year . in any event the show is amusing , entertaining and sad all at once . i would give " Deadliest Catch : Crab Fishing in Alaska "
472967	11423174	120667	7.0	decent superhero film , though not of the epic scale	this movie was certainly entertaining , although it felt a bit incomplete somehow . it is certainly not a movie you would call epic , by any means . it is much more low key than your typical blockbuster movie , i . e the Spider Man or X-Men series . i believe the filmmakers were going for blockbuster status , but the film did not reach that level . from both a critical and artistic standpoint , this movie was received lukewarmly at best ( although some critics and fans praised it . ) one of the problems is that the story could have been developed better . the filmmakers focused more on style than substance . the special effects were pretty decent , although at times they were a little hokey . this is probably due to the relatively low budget of 80 million dollars . also some of the dialogue was cringe worthy at times . however , the acting was solid , their was plenty of action and the film was not boring . However , like i said , the story was sacrificed for style . there is a sequel in the works . let's hope it's more fleshed out . as for this film , despite a few flaws , it was relatively well made . this film gets a strong
473802	11423174	268397	7.0	funny and colourful	this is a pretty decent cg animated movie from Nickelodeon . it's funny at times , has quite a bit of action and a mostly interest sustaining story . it's obviously geared towards kids , but adults will laugh at some of the jokes . it does have a few slow moments , but mostly it's pretty well paced . some of the character are a bit creepy looking , especially the teacher . but there's nothing that could be considered offensive . it's also very colourful , so the kids will love that aspect of it . most adults will be able watch it without falling asleep , but if not , the kids are perfectly safe watching it on their own . for me , Jimmy Neutron : Boy Genius is a
472719	11423174	336325	7.0	not as good as Dracula 2000 , but not bad ( )	this is a sequel to Dracula 2000 , but not completely . it's still about Dracula , but it begins shortly after the first one ended . the thing is , spoiler ahead it ignores the ending of 2000 . if you paid attention to the very end of that film , you'll realize that the events in this one couldn't happen the way they do . end of spoileroh , well , that's life . it still has the same biblical bent to it . but this one lacks many of the things 2000 had . gone is Gerard Butler as the title character , a fairly big loss , in my opinion . this Dracula ( the character ) is not as compelling , nor did i feel he was seductive or charming . gone is also the visual style of 2000 . there's also no macabre humour here . nor is there much action . what is added is some overacting by many of the cast involved . While i don't have anything against Jason Scott Lee , i feel he was trying way too hard to make the character serious . minor spoileroh , and if you're expecting to see Roy Schieder ( he is billed as being one of the stars of the movie ) then you better not blink , or you'll miss him . overall , this entry is not as fun as Dracula 2000 , but i still thought it was OK . For me , Dracula II : Ascension is a
473345	11423174	93780	7.0	entertaining action movie	this movie is about a man who ends up being principal of one of the worst schools in the country . the school is pretty much run by a drug lord / gang banger and his cronies . the teachers have given up hope on the kids and stopped teaching them . Rick Latimer ( James Belushi ) is Latimer , who finds himself in over his head , but won't quit . this is more of an action movie than an inspirational one . it's sorta like The Substitute and other similar movies . i don't think there's any real deep message here . and maybe that wasn't the intent of the filmmakers . maybe they just set out to making an entertaining action movie . if so , they succeeded . i found it entertaining . for me , The Principal is a
472645	11423174	98184	7.0	typical ' serial killer taunts police ' movie , ( with a bit of a twist ) but entertaining with decent performances	this would be your typical ' serial killer taunts police'movie except for one small detail . the audience is let in on the identity of the killer pretty much right off the bat . i think this has been done before , so it's not wholly original , but it's still a bit of a change from most of the genre . the way in which the killer selects his victims might be original , but i'm not completely sure . you might think revealing the killer to the viewer very early on would have a negative impact , but it doesn't seem to . anyway , the remainder of the movie consists of the police trying to find out the killer's identity and stop him . we are given bit of background on why he ends up the way he is and it seems plausible , which is nice for a change . Judd Nelson plays the killer and is credible . there are also touches of humour throughout . the movie moves along at a good clip until the ending . the ending is telegraphed throughout the movie , very deliberately , i think , so it won't come as a very big surprise . anyway , i liked the movie . it's not outstanding but it is entertaining and worth the 90 minutes or so of time .
473557	11423174	432021	7.0	better than the first two by leaps and bounds	i thought this was the best of the Resident Evil franchise . the action was more intense , the fight scenes were away more spectacular and i also really liked the music . obviously , it's not original , bearing many similarities to the first two . and it does borrow heavily from other movies . but still , it is an entertaining romp . i think it is much more gory and graphic than the first two . this is just an observation . it didn't really bother me . this is the first resident Evil movie i have seen on the big screen , and if you have a chance to watch it in the theatre , i think it's worth it . it won't win any awards for deep characterizations or storyline , but it really isn't that kind of movie . it knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything else . i think it does what it sets out to do , and that is to entertain . for me , Resident Evil : Extinction is a definite
473191	11423174	486576	7.0	again , lacks the epic quality it should have , but it doesn't exactly suck	well , at least it didn't suck . but it wasn't as good as the potential hinted at . i guess it's maybe slightly better than the first one , but barely . the story is interesting and has some merit , but the execution of the film left me empty . the Silver Surfer is a pretty cool looking character , but i wish the character had been developed more . Having Laurence Fishburne voice the Surfer was a definite plus , as his voice fit the character perfectly . no disrespect to Doug Jones , who physically played the character . i'm mot sure i've heard Doug Jone's voice , so all i can comment on is Fishburne . like the first one , this movie is too short and seems rushed . it lacks the epic quality this type of movie should have . another problem is the characters didn't really have to do much more or different than they did in the first one . having said that , the movie is entertaining , if not compelling . even with it's problems , i'd give " Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer " . as a final word , if another installment or a possible Silver Surfer spin off , is planned as rumored , one can only hope they pull out all the stops and make whatever's next into what it really should be : an epic tale worthy of its source material . otherwise , there's no point and they should stop right now .
473275	11423174	403016	8.0	great stunts ( gives a new appreciation of the athletes in this sport ) wow !	this movie is not bad at all . some of the stunts these guys ( and girls ) do in Supercross is absolutely astounding . the way they flip in mid air and the heights they can reach . i have a new respect for these people . the stunts were mind blowing , but very realistic , as far as i could tell . there are some hot women in this movie , naturally . the acting is OK and to me , the plot is thin , but that is not the draw for this movie . the real reason to watch this movie , or any of the genre , are the amazing stunts these guys can do . to say they are talented is a huge understatement . i found this movie pretty exciting . it is only during the dramatic scenes that i didn't like it as much . i just wanted to see those stunts . thankfully , that is what most of the movie is . if you're a Supercross fan , you should love this movie . if you're not , you might still really enjoy it . at the very least , you should have a new appreciation for the athletes involved . my vote for " Supercross " :
472982	11423174	422720	8.0	witty and stylish	for a period movie , i felt this was more lite hearted than most . i found it witty , even funny at times . it movies along at a good pace , and is never boring . the movie is also virtually very nice to look at . even though the overall tone of the film is fairly lite , it does treat the more serious issues with the darker tone the deserve . much of the music for the movie is contemporary , which might not work for some people , but i didn't mind it . at first , i didn't care for much of the acting , but the performances grew on me quickly . Kirtsen Dunst shines in the title role . Jason Schwartzman is also good . in a what seems a strange casting choice , Rip Torn also appears in the movie . but Torn makes his character work . though i thought this movie was exceedingly entertaining , i wish the ending had been different . it just didn't work for me . many people may not liker the fact that the movie is done in a lite hearted way , but that didn't bother me here . if it wasn't for the ending , i would have given this movie a higher vote . but as it stands , i give Mare Antoinette an
473777	11423174	457495	8.0	danger , excitement and fun , for both adults and kids	i really enjoyed this movie . it's similar to James Bond , except the spy is a 14 year old kid . there's even a bunch of gadgets , just like In Bond , and there's a version of Q , the guy in charge of the gadgets . this movie has a pretty serious bent , overall , but it also has it's campy , over the top moments . there's plenty of action , intrigue and suspense . and of course , it is also funny at times . the acting is also top topnotch , in my mind anyway . kids and adults will equally enjoy this movie , though it's probably not appropriate for young kids , due to a few dark themes . the ending sets up nicely for a sequel , which was probably planned , but the movie did not do so great at the box office . If you liked Agent Cody Banks , which was similar , but more of comedy , you might want to give this one a try . my vote for Alex Rider : Stormbreaker is a
473705	11423174	134619	8.0	Disturbing behavior-to say the least	Disturbing behavior is the tale of a small coastal town where once unruly teens are transformed into academic geniuses . even stranger is that they all dress the same , join the same clubs , act the same . like soulless automatons . when Steve Clark ( James Marsden ) moves into town , he makes friends with the three misfits : Rachel Wagner ( Katie Holmes ) , Gavin Strick ( Nick Stahl ) and U . V ( Chad Donela ) . once the three realize the reason for the abrupt behavior changes , they must find a way to stop it , before they are next . Bruce Greenwood , ( Thirteen Days , Deja Vu ) William Sadler , ( The Green Mile , Hard to Kill , Ethan Embry ( Harold and Kumar go to White Castle , Sweet Home Alabama ) and Katherine Isabelle ( Earthsea , Insomnia ) also have roles in the film . i thought this was a pretty good film . the premise is not original , but so what . the movie is very dark and will be thought provoking for some , while others will simply enjoy it for it's entertainment value . either way , it's worth watching .
473622	11423174	95243	8.0	very fine movie " based on " the life of Primate expert Dian Fossey	this movie is based on the life of Dian Fossey and her work with the gorillas in a remote part of Africa . " based on " usually means that some of the content is true and parts of it are fictionalized for dramatic effect . for sure Dian Fossey did work with gorillas in Africa and was instrumental in the increase of their population . some of the details may have been altered , but the gist of the story is true . i thought it was a very entertaining , touching and heartbreaking story . i think Sigourney weaver did a great job as Dian Fossey . she really brought some passion to the character . the movie was also thought provoking and i actually became angry more than a few times about some of the incidents that occurred . i find it rare to become so actively involved with a movie nowadays . for me " Gorillas in the Mist " is at a strong
473010	11423174	24368	8.0	i liked it	this movie is more of a lite comedy , murder mystery than a horror . but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie . in fact , i liked it quite a bit . it's very fast moving , has some eccentric and intriguing characters , and it's comedic . it has a sinister feeling to it , but it's not what i would call horror . there is a little bit of overacting , but that's too be expected in an early sound picture , since peop0le were so used to using their facial expression and body language in silent films . Fay Wray is one of the stars in the movie , but her part is not that large , though her character plays an important role in the film , and does a lot of screaming , which is something Fay Wray is known for . the movie really belongs to Glenda Farrel , whose tough talking , sarcastic reporter steals the show . her character is sort of Nancy Drew like . i found her very likable and appealing . my vote for The Mystery of The wax museum :
472879	11423174	618192	8.0	has a good moral message and a strong ending ( )	this is the 8th episode of season 3 of The Justice League . i thought it was pretty good . many of the team unite to try and stop a very powerful foe . the Green lantern Corp . is shown in the beginning , which i thought was cool . the story was pretty good and there's a lot going on here , more action than anything . there's also a good moral message here . i had just seen episode 2 season 3 , and i thought that was a bit better episode . i didn't like this one as much . to me , the story , while pretty good , was not quite as unique or interesting . still , it was a good episode , and i thought it thought it had a very good , strong ending . for me , Justice League : The Return is a
473507	11423174	107504	8.0	" Don't make this dog angry - - you wouldn't like him when he's angry "	this movie was better than i thought it would be . i thought it would be good , but it exceeded my expectations . the acting was fairly decent , but there was one standout - - the dog . all the other characters were secondary . this dog was very well trained and had a personality-to boot . intelligent , lovable , sad and even romantic . there is a brief back story to the dog and how it came to be where it was . this is basically a very genetically enhanced animal , with all senses heightened , great strength , speed and intelligence . the story flowed very well and the dog ( whose mane is Max ) soon becomes endearing to the viewer the filmmakers even added a brief touch of whimsy , which i thought was a hint of brilliance . we feel pain when Max feels pain . Because this dog is such a highly developed character , it becomes very easy to sympathize with him . Even when Max slowly evolves from being a lovable " mutt " into a vicious killing machine we still feel for him . and that ' because we are told early on that Max is not completely under his own control , and every second he is away from the " lab " his killing instincts exert themselves until he becomes psychotic . I was very entertained by this film , having also recently seen " Rottweiller " which is fairly similar , containing some-of the same subject matter but it takes a different tact than " Man's Best Friend " I give this movie an / 10
473907	11423174	381971	8.0	terrific family entertainment	this movie was better than i was expecting . it's lite heated , funny and great fun for the whole family . it's also very touching . there nothing in this movie that can't be watched by any age group . kids should lobe it , and it's also engaging enough for adults . i think the story is interesting enough for both kids and adults . it's n9ice to know there is still some quality family entertainment that really is for the whole family . i also thought the voice actors fit the characters perfectly . if you're a parent , you can set your r child down by themselves , knowing they are watching something which is perfectly kid friendly , and you might like it as well . for me Curious George is an
473050	11423174	338526	8.0	one wild ride	i don't understand the low rating for ( ) for this movie on this site . i thoroughly enjoyed myself throughout . the basic Gist of the story is this : Van Helsing take son Count Dracula , The Wolfman , and the Frankenstein Monster in one adventure . what more could you ask for ? this is one fast paced thrill ride , with spectacular action and fight sequences . Hugh Jackman is Van Helsing , and makes the character larger than life . Kate Beckinsale is Anna Valerious , whose family has for centuries tried to rid the world of evil . she teams up with Van Helsing , and the sparks fly . there is no denying the chemistry between the two . i wouldn't call this a scary movie , but it is very intense at times , and a bit morbid . it doesn't take itself seriously though , which works in this case . for me , Van Helsing is an
473642	11423174	55254	8.0	fun for the whole family	i really enjoyed this animated Disney classic . it's just a lot of fun . lots of action and excitement , and an excellent choice for the villain in Cruella Devil . whose is iconic ( or should be ) in my opinion . very young children may be a bit frightened of her , as she certainly is scary looking . her 2 henchman are quite inept , and provide a lot of comic relief . i also really liked the voice acting . i thought it fit well with the characters . the animation is also good , considering it is from 1961 , though i'm sure it took a few years before that to complete . anyway , in my opinion , this classic is good fun for the whole family . my vote for 101 Dalmatians is an
473417	11423174	358135	8.0	Bored lawyer adds spice to his life by secretly taking ballroom dance lessons	this movie is a remake of a Japanese film made in 1996 . i haven't seen the original , so i'll only comment on this , the 2004 version . This movie is about a bored lawyer who has been married for nearly 20 years and had the same job for a long time . he decides to spice up his life and without telling anyone begins taking ball room dance lessons . Richard Gere is John Clark , the bored lawyer . Susan Sarandon is his wife . Jennifer Lopez is the dance instructor who John feels a connection to . Stanley Tucci provides some light comic relief as one of the students . This is a whimsical , light hearted movie . it is enjoyable and there are some good performances . Gere in particular seems to really be having fun with his character during the dance scenes . Lopez , however , comes off a bit stiff and forced at times . Tucci turns in another great supporting performance and is very funny at times . Lisa Ann Walter also provides some laughs with her character Bobby . Richard Jenkins plays a detective named Devine , hired by Clark's wife Beverly ( Susan Sarandon ) who suspects he may be having an affair . Nick Cannon plays Devine's assistant . Susan Sarandon is very good as Beverly Clark , but has a fairly small role in the film . the film is a romantic comedy , emphasis on romantic , but as previously mentioned , does have some comedic elements . the comedy is more of the amusing , chuckling type of laughs . there is nothing which could be called hysterical . if that's what you're looking for , this is not your movie . the movie is fairly predictable , and has the usual feel good ending , but arrives there a bit differently than i expected . Overall , i really enjoyed this movie .
472540	11423174	266915	8.0	funnier and more action packed than the first one	i found this movie to be better than the first one . there's still lots of action , but it's even funnier than the first . there's some really good fight scenes , and Jackie Chan's moves are even more outrageous this time around . the banter between Chan and Tucker is much funnier and more natural . once again , although there is some violence it's not excessive or gratuitous . i think there is also less coarse language than the first , and like the first , there is no nudity , but there is a bit of suggestiveness . overall , i though this movie was a great ride from start to finish . it's even faster paced than the original , and Tucker and Chan have even better general and comedic chemistry . for me , Rush Hour 2 is an
473457	11423174	115348	8.0	sublime but effective mini series giving a snapshot of what the super wealthy and powerful can get away with	this is a compelling , engaging mini series based in part on a real life event and the aftermath . it's long , clocking in at over 2 and a half hours ( without commercials ) but it never once failed to maintain my interest . it's basically about how a young man of wealth and influence commits a horrendous crime , and because of the family influence and power , is able to cover it up for many years . i won't say what happens next . you'll have to watch it to find out . i'm pretty certain most people will find this movie not only fascinating and engrossing , but also illuminating . even though it's a fictional telling of an actual event with fictional characters , both the characters and the event mirror real life people of wealth and privilege and how normal laws and morals do not apply to them . so while you are being entertained , you also get a snapshot of the super wealthy and powerful as a bonus . this is really an ambitious production and it succeeds in what it sets out to do , in my mind . i wouldn't call it powerful exactly . it's more sublime and it just kind of sneaks up on you as it moves toward it conclusion . nevertheless , it is still very effective . the acting in this movie is very good from people you wouldn't necessarily associate with the kind of characters they play in this movie . Brian Dennehy plays the family patriarch and gives a commanding performance . Patrick Dempsey plays a childhood friend of the family . Sherilyn Finn plays one of the daughters of the clan . Edward Herman has a what amounts to an extended cameo , but is terrific in his scenes . but it is Bonnie Bedelia who really impressed me with her character . she isn't in the movie for very long and not until close to the end , but in my mind , she really stand out . i won't say what character she plays because i don't wan to give anything away , even the smallest detail . for me , " A Season in Purgatory " is a strong
472678	11423174	31346	8.0	the inspiration for John Ford's classic My Darling Clementine	i liked this western quite a bit . it is made in 1939 , and some may find the pace a bit sedate , but that didn't bother me . i liked the story and the cast of characters . the main character is Wyatt Earp ( Randolph Scott ) newly deputized as marshal to try to bring some law into the town of Tombstone . The character Of Doc Halliday ( Ceasar Romero ) also plays a prominent role . there were a few scenes which were meant to be funny , and they probably were back in 1939 , but they fell a bit flat for me . it's the movie that inspired the John Ford classic My Darling Clementine ( 1946 ) . the 1957 movie Gunfight at the OK Corral is also apparently inspired by this movie . one thing i should mention is that the sound and the picture were crystal clear , so kudos for Fox for the technical work that went into the DVD . anyway , when all is said and done , i thought this was a pretty good movie . easily an
472876	11423174	443536	8.0	the true ( animated ) story of Red Riding Hood ( not really of , course )	forget everything you've heard about " Little Red Riding Hood " , this is the true story . well , not really of course but is an animated take on the fairy tale . the gist of the story is that the police have been looking for the perpetrator of a series of crimes ( non-violent of course ) , well one crime , actually , committed several times . anyway , a series of events lead the police to 4 suspects : Red herself , ( Anne Hathaway ) Granny ( Glen Close ) , The Woodsman ( Jim Belushi ) The Wolf ( Patrick Warburton ) . we are treated to a series of flashbacks , one by each character depicting the events that had transpired according to their own viewpoint . By the way , almost all the characters in the movie , from the police chief on down , are characters mostly from the original rendition of the fairly tale . Some of these characters are quite amusing anyway , through the flashbacks , we are treated to some comedy , action ( including some extreme sports ) some drama , mystery , and the movie even becomes a musical for a brief time . and there are some suspenseful moments . there are also some scenes of mild to moderate peril , so it might be a bit too much for very young children , otherwise it all adds up to one very entertaining experience suitable for ( generally ) the whole family . as well , it is also unpredictable , right until nearly the very end , when the perpetrator is finally revealed ( it is not who you might think ) . finally , all the actor's voices really went well with their respective roles . truly a wacky , unique tale on the Red riding Hood Fable .
473913	11423174	84855	8.0	Newman , Paul Newman	Paul Newman stars in this story of a washed up , alcoholic lawyer , with a a long losing streak . he gets handed a case which he could settle out of court , but doesn't . instead he takes it to trial . that's the gist of The Verdict . it has it's compelling moments , especially when Newman is on screen . he's hard to take your eyes off . Charlotte Rampling is also very good here . Jack Warden has a supporting performance , but his character doesn't have a lot to do . this is really Newman's show . the film is very deliberate in it's pacing , which builds suspense for the last scene . i don't think it's to realistic , but that's not the point . the point is , it's an entertaining tale with great acting
472822	11423174	317919	8.0	Keri Russel , Laurence Fishburne , Philip Seymour Hoffman . . . .	the three main reasons this " Mission Impossible " entry is the best yet . yeah , Tom Cruise is back , of course , and does a good job as the main character Ethan Hunt . however , it is the presence of the three actors mentioned in my summary which make this movie succeed . first , Laurence Fishburne , a physically imposing presence for sure , but also extremely charismatic with a very palpably intense screen presence . i think he owns any scene he is in . next , Philip Seymour Hoffman , also a very strong screen presence who manges to be both understated and mesmerizing at the same time . and Keri Russel , ( from the dramatic TV series " Felicity " very impressive here in an action movie . she impressed me the most in this movie . there is just something about her , something intangible you can't put your finger on . the rest of the supporting cast are also strong . also , this third installment in the series is not convoluted , like the first , and not as reality defying as the second . don't get me wrong , there are some stunts that are not too realistic , but to a lesser degree and not as frequent . i also think the story is better and the villain is very strong . this would be the ideal end to the franchise , since it goes out on a high note . but time will tell . the last three or four " Bond " films ( excluding the last one ) were much more unrealistic . i highly recommend Mi : III . an easy
472993	11423174	251736	8.0	bury me in a nameless grave	this may be a horror movie , but it's not a run of the mill horror movie . for one thing , it's actually clever and creative . it's also a very dark comedy . the villains in this movie aren't your typical villains . they're quite memorable , with very good characterizations . the acting is very good , but Sheri Moon ( eventually Sherri Moon Zombie ) stands out with a brilliant performance . there are some really tense moments here , thanks to some good direction and timing . the look of the film is also great . it takes place in the 70's and some scenes are grainy and gritty reflecting many movies made at the time . the soundtrack is killer , with some boffo haunting tracks , and the score is also terrific . the music is 70's era sound , like the movie Planet Terror , one half of the Grindhouse feature . House of 100 corpses is Rob Zombie's first feature film as writer and director . the only other Rob Zombie movie i have seen is The recent Halloween remake , which i liked . i was more impressed with House of 1000 copses though . for me , House of 1000 Copses is a well deserved
473807	11423174	309152	8.0	true crime buffs will like it	this documentary type series features 52 minute episodes of crimes committed in the past ( usually one crime per episode ) in which the FBI and local law enforcement cooperate to solve crimes . parts of the crimes are reenacted with actors . throughout the episode a narrator describes the events . real people who were involved in the original investigation are also interviewed in present day and recount their experience with the particular incident . the series is gripping and fast paced , but can be very morbid , as sometimes the particulars of the crimes are fairly well detailed . there isn't always a happy ending , either . if you're a true crime buff and you haven't seen this show i encourage you to check it out . in North America , The 1st season is out on DVD , and the 2nd and 3rd have been announced for release . my vote for The F : B : I : Files is a strong
473619	11423174	396401	9.0	i thought it was very suspenseful , creepy and entertaining	i thought this was a really good movie . it's a sort of ghost story / end of the world prophecy combination . it has some similarities to both " The Ring " and " The Grudge " . i didn't really care for those 2 movies . i just didn't feel they worked for me . this 1 however , worked really well for me . there are many very suspenseful and eerie moments . the hair on my neck stood up a lot in this movie . i thought the acting was pretty good . i also liked that fact that they kept you guessing about things until the end . i did , anyway , and i wasn't sure how it would end . i like unpredictability in these kinds of movies . the ending is sort of open ended , so you can come to your own conclusions . i think this is 1 of the better movies of this genre , that i have seen . i'm sure there are lot's of plot holes and inconsistencies , if you really look for them . but i just wanted to be entertained and hopefully creeped out for a couple hours , and i was . besides , i / m sure every movie has flaws of some kind . it just depends what your reasons for watching are . if you did enjoy " The Grudge " and " The Ring " , you may enjoy this movie as much or maybe more . for me , " 11 : 11 : Hell's Gate is a
473817	11423174	118708	9.0	very funny , hysterically at times	this is a very funny movie . Chris Farley is hysterical as an inept , clumsy ninja of sorts . the laughs come fast and furious in this one , and i have to say i laughed hard a lot . yes , the movie is silly , but in a good way . there is no toilet humour in this movie , which is nice . they're not scraping the bottom of the barrel to get laughs . the humour in this movie is something most people will relate to or at least get . there are also some dramatic moments which are done well . Nicolette Sheridan plays the sort of love interest , and she does a good job in her role . of course , she's also easy on the eyes . if you like movies with a lot of physical comedy and pratfalls , this may be your movie . this movie is not an academy award winner , obviously , but then , it's not that type of movie . for me , this is one of the funniest movies i've seen in quite some time . " Beverly Hills Ninja " gets a from me .
472589	11423174	91209	9.0	classic horror suspense that stands up well over 20 years later	i thought this was a very good movie . it had action and suspense . it was very intense in some scenes . i also thought Rutger Hauer was very convincing as a psycho , while C . Thomas Howell is good as the hero . Jennifer Jason Leigh is also good in a supporting role . there is also a very inventive and nail biting torture scene that doesn't end the way you might think . another thing i really liked was the fact that many things are implied , but not shown , adding another dimension to the movie . this movie certainly had me on the edge of my seat a lot . to me , " The Hitcher is a classic , and still stands up well today . i'ts low budget , but effective . i give this movie

Doug Lyman directs and does a superb job . Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne , and is incredible in the role . the guy can act , that's for sure . Franka Potente plays a pretty big role as well . there is also a great supporting cast . the dramatic moments are done very well and are very compelling . there's lots of suspense and tension , as well as some twists and turns . i liked the characters themselves , as well as each how each actor made their roles their own . as this type of movie ( Spy / intigue ) goes , this is one of the best of the genre . it should keep you glued to your seat for the 119 minute running time . if you like this movie , you might also want to check out Mr . and Mrs .

473728	11423174	409182	9.0	very thrilling and suspenseful disaster flick	i really enjoyed this movie . i found It entertaining , thrilling and exciting . i also found it suspenseful . it was also very touching and sad at times . really felt for the characters . the movie starts off with a bang , almost right away . once that happened i was sure the rest of the movie would be less exciting . i was wrong in this case . the acting was good . the CGI was excellent . the movie didn't make very much money at the box office , which surprises me . i thought it was much better than many movie that made lots of money . but everyone has there opinion . the rating ( ) is kinda low in my view . the only thing i have a little problem with is the ending . it's not a bad ending . it's just that i found it a bit abrupt . i hoped we would have a few scenes showing how the survivors were doing down the road , how they had coped with the tragedy . other than that , i have no complaints about the movie . my rating for " Poseidon " is
473594	11423174	264464	9.0	terrifically entertaining lite hearted fare from Steven Spielberg	Steven Spielberg directed this light hearted " based on a true story " crime drama . it's basically about one young man who assumes several different identities while forging millions of dollars worth of checks without the FBI being aware of it . along the way , he poses an a doctor , lawyer and a commercial pilot . once the FBI does catch on to him he manges to stay at least one step ahead of them . this movie takes place in the 60's and in this day and age , a Frank Abagnale would not likely have been successful in forging checks and / or eluding the authorities . Leonardo DiCaprio plays the lead role of Frank Abagnale . leading the FBI investigation is Carl Hanratty played by Tom Hanks . it's fun to see the two try to outwit each other , and there are some close calls for Frank , in which he is moments from being discovered . just like in The Terminal , Steven Spielberg shows he is just as skilled with the lighter fare as with the darker subjects he is known for .
473482	11423174	326769	9.0	very entertaining movie with a strong story anchored by great performances from the lead actors	very good movie . it's about motorcycle street racing , but there is more than that going on . the movie is also about relationships , love and the struggles it takes to get to where you want to be . to me , the story was very deep and anchored by some very fine acting performances . the two main characters are played by Laurence Fishburne and Derek Luke . Fishburne is " Smoke " champion Street racer who has never , ( as far as i could tell ) been beat . he holds the title of " King of Kali " and is the leader of " the Black Knights " , one of the racing teams . . Luke Plays Kidd . an upstart young man who wants nothing more than to dethrone " Smoke " . of course it will not be easy , maybe even impossible . who can tell . if you wanna know more , you'll have to watch the movie . the only thing i will say is that there is a revelation which adds a new dimension to things . there are of course some very nice motorcycles and some good racing scenes . there are also some crazy stunts that are amazing . and there are some hot babes . when you put all that together , it makes for quite a show . i would have to disagree with the low rating this movie has . sometimes it boggles my mind and i wonder what people are really looking for in a movie . i know everybody has their own opinions and movie tastes are ( usually ) subjective , but it is still no less mystifying . For me , " Biker Boyz " is a
472980	11423174	70016	9.0	classic animated children's tale	this is a classic animated children's movie , but it also deals with the issue of dying and death , but in a tasteful way . kids will no doubt love it , with its abundance of songs / musical numbers . it's also funny at times . the movie could also be useful in improving young kids vocabulary and their spelling skills . of course , this would be lost on really young kids , but " older " young kids would benefit . another good thing about this movie is it teaches the value of friendship and working together . there is really nothing offensive at all here , though like i said the movie does deal with the issue of death and it might be a bit too intense for the really young . so parents should use their discretion , just to be on the safe side .
472873	11423174	119819	9.0	woman dispatches fellow office workers , than just about everyone else in sight in black comedy , horror / suspense hybrid that is very effective	this movie is obviously about someone who kills people in the office . and we learn very quickly who the killer is , so i don't think it's possible to give too much away . Said killer is knebbish office worker Dorine Douglas ( Carol Kane ) . Douglas is a very lonely , insecure waif who lives with her overbearing mother . Douglas decides to begin killing people in her office , after witnessing one of her co-workers accidentally get killed . Douglas realizing she feels something akin to joy at his death . and she covers his death up . i should mention that most of her fellow workers treat her with disdain , or worse , even to the point of cruelty and hurtful remarks . so she feel justification for her feelings . soon , she dispatches another co-worker and then another . thing is , once she starts , she just keeps going and going and going . ( like the Energizer Bunny ) as the bodies mount up , Douglas also starts killing co-workers who are actually not that mean to her . and then , just about anyone she comes in contact with , she kills ( i mean anyone ) . I have to say that Cane does a very good job in the role . her character becomes quite gleeful of her work , treating it something akin to getting an A plus on a report card . ( you can tell Cane had a lot of fun with this role ) . she is a true sociopath , to be sure . and she engages in some very amusing rituals which i won't go into here . let's just say , you have to see it to believe it . so , what genre does this movie fall into ? well , horror , to be sure and suspense , and most prevalent , black comedy , very black . there are also a lot of intentional campy moments . some of the situations are so absurd and over the top , you have to laugh . this movie works on all levels and it proves you don't need a gi-normous ( gigantic / enormous ) budget to make a very effective movie . truly a unique piece of art .
473008	11423174	322330	9.0	high energy fun	i liked the original Freaky Friday ( 1976 ) starring a teenage Jodi Foster and Barbara Harris . i thought it was sweet , touching , and funny . this updated version is also really good . it's much higher energy than the original version . the acting by Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan is superb as they play role reversal , Curtis playing the role of the 15 year old daughter Anna , and Lohan playing th role of her mother Tess , while still in their original bodies . of course Anna and her mother have nothing in common , so living in each other's bodies is a real wakeup call . besides the central premise , the movie is formulaic . still . it's fun watching Lohan and Curtis trying to navigate the other one's life . naturally there's a lesson involved , and mom and daughter finally begin to understand each other . anyway really liked it .
472739	11423174	146336	9.0	creative premise , compelling storyline , and strong , likable characters	i'm amazed at the low rating for this movie ( ) i though this was a great movie . it intelligently written , compelling and most of all unpredictable . but it also has strong , likable characters . sure , it borrows from other movies . but the actual general premise is unique , as far as i know . this movie kept me guessing right to the very end . . that to me , says it's well written . you have a lot of people to choose from who could be the killer , and they all have their reasons . is is scary ? no , but it is creepy and eerie and it does keep you interested . i really felt for some of the characters who were killed , which says something . i'n sure there are plot holes and inconsistencies , just like most movies . however , they are not as obvious in this movie . you really have to look for them . if a movie has blatant flaws that you can see miles away , that's different . the point is , in my mind , this is a great movie . i give " Urban Legends " a
473266	11423174	167404	10.0	a modern psychological suspense masterpiece	i'm not going to give much of the plot of this one away , just in case you're one of the three people on the planet who hasn't seen this movie . suffice to say that it is one of the greatest psychological suspense thrillers in modern time . this is one eerie movie , strongly anchored by the performance of Haley Joel Osment . , who plays the character to which the title refers . Bruce Willis and Toni Collette also put in strong performances . and watch for a brilliant performance from an unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg ( yes that Donnie Wahlberg from " New Kids on the Block " fame ) . who knew he could act ? you will almost certainly have to watch this movie more than once , and you will discover something new each time . if you have'nt seen it , and somehow have managed to avoid knowing anything about it , i highly recommend it . to end , i will just say that this movie is a modern Masterpiece . 10 + + + / 10
472961	11423174	91326	10.0	sequel improves on original	once again we have a case where the sequel outdoes the original . the original set the stage for the characters and is well done . however , the sequel is better than the original for one main reason , a better villain . this time Daniel is forced to fight for his life ( literally ) against a much more skilled opponent than he faced in the original . there is much more tension in this movie and more scenes of peril . the violence is more vivid and graphic . The setting is much more exotic , this time Okinawa being where most of the story takes place . so , visually we have a much more picturesque movie to look at . also , we see some of the culture of the people of Okinawa ( accurate or not , i'm not sure ) . there is also more happening in this film . we have a subplot involving Mr . Myagi and a choice he must make . so , the story is more developed , the location is nicer , and the villain is better written than the 1st . and of course Mr . Myagi continues to teach Wisdom to Daniel as well as the Okinawan Village . when you add it all up , this makes for a better movie . but parents should be warned , again , that their is more graphic violence and sequences of peril in this one . use your discretion .
473444	11423174	80684	10.0	The strongest Entry in the Star Wars Saga	how do you top a movie like the original star wars . well , it's not easy , but you make a better movie . by better , i mean a more fleshed out storyline and characters . also the motivations of some characters are more clearly defined . this movie is definitely darker than the original , which makes sense since the enemy triumphs , if only for a short time . this movie built upon the strengths of the 1st one , namely good story line which carries the movie forward and of course the villain , who is much stronger in this installment . it goes without saying that the visual effects are once again outstanding . this entry is considered by many to be the strongest of the saga , and rightly so . it sets up perfectly for its sequel " return of the Jedi " . this film gets a very strong only because that is the highest rating given by IMDb
473451	11423174	29843	10.0	brilliant	where to start ? this is one terrific movie . it's funny , has good characters and dialogue . it's also action packed . true , many of the fighting scenes seems a bit corny , but that's probably how they fought back then . back then , they really had to act , unlike today , where some special effect can distract the viewer , so the actor isn't the main focus . also , this was 1938 , and talking pictures hadn't brr around that long . many actors were used to the style of acting in the silent films and just carried that over to the talkies . as for the DVD itself , it has been beautifully restored . the picture is cleans sharp and crisp . anyway , for me " The Adventures of Robin hood is a
473706	11423174	208874	10.0	truly great political intrigue film	The contender is a powerful , riveting movie of political backstabbing and hidden agendas . it is full of suspense and intrigue . a very dramatic film , yet not at all boring , with a great mix of characters and some explosive revelations . this is a very well done movie with some big name actors putting in stellar performances . Jeff Bridges plays president Jackson Evans , who , upon the death of the vice-president is faced with the task of nominating a replacement . Joan Allen plays democratic senator Laine Hanson , the president's nominee . However she must first appear before the confirmation committee and be approved . and this will not prove easy . this is where the movie really gets going . both Bridges and Allen put in solid performances , but it is Gary Oldman who plays committee chair Sheldon Runyon ( a republican ) who is a standout . Oldman gives a powerhouse performance . Christian Slater , Sam Elliott , William Peterson , Saul Rubinek , and Philip Baker Hall , among others also put in terrific performances . this is truly a great movie . but , if you are sensitive about your politics , you might want to avoid this one . otherwise prepare to be entertained for 2 hours .
472681	11423174	424095	10.0	if you thought Wallace and Gromit in the Curse of the Wererabbit was funny ,	you will really love this film . what a riot it was . i'ts from Dreamworks and Aardman Entertainment , the same people behind Wallace and Gromit . it's hysterically funny and fast paced and exciting . i loved Wallace and Gromit in The Curse of The Wererabbit , but i thought this movie was even funnier . it's a bit more risqué with the humour , which adults will pick up on , and kids will of course love it . a lot of the humour is very cheeky . there is a bit of rude , and crude humour here . not only is the film funny , it also looks very good , technically . the choice of actors for the voices was brilliant . the whole thing is just so well done . for me , Flushed Away is a
473286	11423174	280609	10.0	soldiers on routine training exercise find out they are not alone	this movie rocked . the acting was great , the dialogue was good and it was very suspenseful . also the action scenes were relentless . so far it has the most realistic werewolves of any movie i have seen to date . the twist ending was brilliant and i never saw it coming . i was told by a friend that this movie was awesome , but that didn't prepare me for what i was about to watch . i believe the filmmakers had a very limited budget , but they did amazing things with what they had . i can't say enough good things about this movie . as for those people who thought " dog soldiers " was garbage , and i'm sure they're in the minority , i just can't understand it . they must have been watching a different movie . this is in my opinion a movie that should not be missed . . brilliant .
473669	11423174	265632	10.0	something for everyone ( outstanding )	if you want a movie that both kids and adults will enjoy , this is the movie for you . it's a cartoon based on the Recess TV show . it has jokes and references both kids and adults will understand , and some that only kids will get , others only adults will get . but the main thing is , it's immensely entertaining . it's very funny at times , with some slapstick and some funny dialogue . it also has interesting characters . plus the story is good . it's easy enough for kids to follow , and not so simple that adults will be disinterested . it also ( without hitting anyone over the head ) shows the value of working together to solve a problem . it's definitely family friendly with nothing that should be considered offensive , but it does have a bit of rude humour . for me , just out of sheer entertainment value , i give Recess : School's Out a
473781	11423174	90605	10.0	more sci-fi / action than horror , but a better movie than the origninal	although Aliens is not the iconic film that alien is , it is still a better film . this film adds a new element by having multiple aliens rather than just the one . it improves upon the look of the creatures , and while maintaining high suspense , adds more action . this film is less character driven than the first . the characters are more developed though and there is more of a group dynamic going on . we have some of the characters fighting each other , as well as the alien threat . the pacing is a bit better in this film . Obviously , this film is not responsible for the rebirth of horror / sci fi , since the original lays claim to that . but it is , in its own right a classic and will be remembered for a long time to come .
