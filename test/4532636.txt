573367	4532636	147612	1.0	Gives a Bad Name to Independent Cinema	" Happiness " is a film that has nothing to say to me , as it's about a version of America I don't recognize and have never seen . Director Todd Solondz , whose style and choice of subject matter could best be described as repellent , seems to think all Americans are living miserable , fractured lives and anyone who's not is lying about it . This is an ugly film filled with ugly characters doing ugly things , that ultimately has very little to say . Solondz may have fancied himself a new and daring artist at the time of this film's release , but showing a cum shot on film does not a groundbreaking or profound movie make . Todd Solondz belongs to a small group of filmmakers ( Lars von Trier is another ) who primarily want to use cinema as a device to drive people away , making one wonder why they want to make movies at all . I hate this movie .
573440	4532636	785007	1.0	Eva Longoria Deserves the Flames of Hell	Much of " Over Her Dead Body " is so painfully unfunny that I was actually squirming in my seat out of embarrassment for the actors . Eva Longoria proves that she can't carry a film in this terrible romantic comedy , and further , that she doesn't really even have any comedic timing . She's grating and annoying as a ghost who returns to earth to keep a cooky psychic from dating her widower fiancé . The fiancé is played by Paul Rudd , drippy and charmless , while the psychic is played by Lake Bell , bringing the movie whatever anemic energy it has . I felt most sorry for Bell , as she appears to have some comic abilities and was working overtime in an effort to make the material work . Unfortunately , she is up against the insurmountable task of making any movie that features Jason Biggs tolerable , and she is dragged down with the rest of the cast like Leo DiCaprio at the end of " Titanic . " " Over Her Dead Body " actually pied me off , because of its laziness and utter lack of effort . I started to think of all the interesting projects that can't get funded because vast amounts of money are being funneled into bland crap like this . Seriously , does Hollywood think movies like this are good enough ? How stupid do they really think the movie-going public is ?
573531	4532636	80761	1.0	When Slasher Films Were Innocent	How did this movie ever get the reputation as a horror classic ? I've been re-watching the " Friday the 13th " series recently and have been struck by how awfully incompetent they are as films . This first installment I guess has the advantage of being novel , though not really , since it doesn't use any formula conventions that " Halloween " didn't use two years earlier . And the actual film making technique in " Halloween " makes it seem like " Lawrence of Arabia " compared to this . Still , there is something nostalgically satisfying about these movies . Seeing dopey teenagers get axed in the face and knifed through the throat brings a little glow to my heart . This was made at a time when slasher movies had a kind of innocence that horror movies now have lost . These films were nasty at the time , but they're absolutely quaint when compared to the nasty cinema coming out now in the same genre , a sad testament to just how jaded we've become . As far as rating this particular movie , not all of the movies in the series are as bad as this one , but I can't bring myself to give the original anything other than a big fat F .
573547	4532636	73540	1.0	Pretentious and Dull - - The Worst Combination	Ugh . . . an endless and interminable movie about a batch of oppressed school girls who go missing during a picnic at the eponymous rock formation . There seem to be plenty of viewers armed with psycho-babble to defend this film's deeper meaning , its undertones of sexuality , power , repression , etc . , etc . , blah , blah , blah . Whatever . I'm sure director Peter Weir knew what point he was trying to make , but this movie is a monotonous , droning bore , and I was left with no incentive to make sense of it . On top of all of that , it's also unforgivably pretentious , proof that Weir is better off sticking to the mainstream fare that has made him famous ( " Dead Poets Society , " " Witness , " " Master and Commander " ) and leave the art film to others .
574077	4532636	85959	2.0	Downright Painful	Believe me , I did not want to dislike this movie , but ultimately I thought it was just awful . They Pythoners show none of the comedic dexterity on display in " The Holy Grail " or " Life of Brian , " and this movie put me sadly in mind of the worst " SNL " skits , when one lame joke is drawn agonizingly out over a 10 or 15 minute skit . " The Meaning of Life " is much edgier in subject matter than its predecessors , but so what ? Making something edgier does not inherently make it funnier . I have to believe the high rating this film received at IMDb is a tribute more to all of the love out there for Monty Python and not for this film in particular . A movie that may cause you to crack the barest of smiles once or twice , if it's lucky .
573401	4532636	56937	2.0	In the Running for Most Boring Movie Ever Made	I can't imagine this gargantuan historical epic being of interest to anyone . As a serious piece of film , it's far too wooden and dull to appeal to cinephiles ; but for the same reasons , it doesn't even satisfy those looking for trashy camp . In terms of its physical production , " Cleopatra " takes the " more is better " approach , and stuffs every frame with gawdy set and costume details . Everything about the film is enormous ; as a result , all of the actors are buried beneath a hopeless pile of Technicolor . Everyone walks around delivering stiff speeches , but no one really develops a character . The only person who manages to infuse the film with some life is Rex Harrison , so his departure from the film at the half-way point ( with 2 + hours still to go ! ) is utterly demoralizing . The film grinds to a slower and slower pace as the remainder progresses , like an unwound music box , until by the end you can almost literally hear the DVD player laboring to spin the DVD around . This stinker landed with a huge thud at the time of its release , and it lands with a thud now . No amount of perspective can save it .
573327	4532636	32145	2.0	Witheringly Boring Heights	" Wuthering Heights " is a florid , over-heated , dull Gothic romance based on a florid , over-heated , dull Gothic novel . This movie and everything about it grated on me - - why it's considered to be such a classic ( and worthy of placement on the AFI's list of 100 greatest films of all time ) I'll never know . I guess it is unique in that it brings a level of psychological complexity to the romantic melodrama that films hadn't really seen to that point . And it introduced Laurence Olivier ( he of the massive chin dimple ) , who would go on to become one of the most admired of screen actors , to American audiences . But beyond that my praise ends . The rest is a brooding bore , with a love story I didn't give a rat's ass about . The star of the movie is the sterling black and white cinematography courtesy of Gregg Toland , who would go on to top himself in " The Grapes of Wrath " the following year and " Citizen Kane " the year after that . With simple lighting alone , he can load a shot of a clanging gate or a fluttering curtain with psychological import . But the problem with this movie is that it's ALL psychological import and zilch compelling drama . It's the kind of movie that lends itself easily to movie stills but is completely devoid of life in every other respect . Thumbs up for the cinematography . As for everything else . . . Blech !
574039	4532636	443649	2.0	Mammoths and Tigers and Bad Acting , Oh My ! !	Thank God that Roland Emmerich is making movies and setting history straight , because without him I never would have realized that prehistoric man looked not unlike cast members from " Rent . " What is that elusive ingredient that makes a bad movie fun to watch ? Because whatever it is , " 10 , 000 B . C . " is missing it . This film skips bad and settles instead for boring - - I found myself having to struggle mighty hard to keep my attention from wandering in the film's last hour or so . On the other hand , it seems almost pointless to bother watching a film like this and then rip it apart . It's not unlike cracking open an egg you know has gone bad , and then complaining when it smells foul .
574460	4532636	61439	3.0	This Round Table Is as Square as They Come	A lumbering screen version of the hit Broadway musical . " Camelot " came out at a time when Hollywood was losing its ability to make good screen musicals . Partly , audience taste was changing , and quaint stuff like " Camelot " just looked dated and irrelevant next to films like " The Graduate " or " Bonnie and Clyde . " But much of the blame falls to the filmmakers themselves , who tried to impose a trendy 1960s visual style on material rooted to the stage , and the results were gangly and ugly . " Camelot " is one of the worst examples of this - - it's a terrible looking film . However , the reason for its complete failure lies in its casting , which gets just about everything wrong . Vanessa Redgrave is certainly beautiful enough for the part of Guinevere , but she looks bored by her part and gives a vapid , listless performance . She also looks incredibly uncomfortable with the fake singing duties she's asked to perform . All of the same things are wrong with Richard Harris , who on paper would seem to make a perfect King Arthur . The Lerner and Loewe musical score , never one of my favorites anyway , sounds bad as it's presented here . And Joshua Logan , true to form , wields his camera like a bowling ball . Everything feels heavy , sluggish and ponderous . The 1960s had its musical hits ( " West Side Story , " " The Sound of Music " ) and its misses . Guess which category " Camelot " falls into .
574472	4532636	37536	3.0	A Boring Do-Over	Ugh , this film is dull and tedious . It followed the huge box office success and heap of Oscars bestowed upon " Going My Way , " and virtually sets out to recreate that film with some minor changes . One of those changes is the addition of Ingrid Bergman , and thank God for her . I've never been much of a Bergman fan , but I'm so glad she was in this , or I would have slipped into a coma . The best scene in the film is when she teaches a young boy how to fight . I've never seen Bergman so breezy and happy-go-lucky on screen , and the sight of her in her nun's costume bouncing around her office in imitation of a boxer is the only moment of life and energy in this desultory film . Bing Crosby plays the same role for which he won an Oscar the year before ; that is , he plays himself . As in the previous film , he croons a sappy song ( in this case " Aren't You Glad You're You " ) . As in the previous film , there's some attempt at dramatic tension built around a curmudgeonly old man who wants to tear down the church or something . Frankly , I wasn't paying that much attention . As in the previous film . . . . . but you get the picture . When I had my wisdom teeth removed , my oral surgeon prescribed a hefty dose of Xanax an hour before the surgery to send me into a loopy stupor . This film might have had the same effect on me , and would have saved me a pharmacy co-pay .
574319	4532636	383574	3.0	YO , HO , HO and a Mixed Bag of Fun	Midway through the third installment of Walt Disney's deliriously popular pirate franchise , a character says of Capt . Jack Sparrow ( played by Johnnny Depp in what now has to qualify as one of the weirdest characterizations in screen history ) , " Is he making this up as he goes along ? " Shiver me timbers , mateys , but one has to ask director Gore Verbinski and his team of wranglers , er , writers , the same question of the entire series . I did not fall in love like so many others with the first film in the trilogy , " The Curse of the Black Pearl , " but I saw its appeal . It was far too long and sloppy , criticisms that have been leveled at parts two and three but which apply to the first movie as well . I can't even really remember the plot . It has something to do with Sparrow's beloved ship , the Black Pearl , being stolen from him by the rival pirate captain Barbossa ( the marvelous Geoffrey Rush , bringing some obligatory British class to the proceedings ) and his army of undead , and Sparrow's efforts , along with that most boring pair of screen lovers , Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom , to get it back . Depending on your perspective , that plot summary either wraps it up or barely scratches the surface , because " Pirates " is stuffed with more subplots than it can handle . Never has so much plot been shoe-horned into a movie ( or trilogy of movies ) and so much of it not mattered a bit . It turns out that Sparrow is actually undead himself , and some sort of curse need be broken if he is to regain his mortality . Well , it's not ruining anything to tell you that the curse is indeed broken , and loose ends are wrapped up while everything's left conveniently open for a sequel . That sequel , " Dead Man's Chest , " takes everything that is charming about the first episode and pushes it past the limits of the audience's endurance . What a gormless mess the second part is , all furious action and racing around with absolutely no attempt made at coherence . A tremendous amount of plot exposition occurs in this installment . Indeed , the whole film is really set up for part three , yet at the same time is paced as if the entire movie is one long climax . Our consolation is that Bill Nighy makes his first appearance as Davy Jones ( no , not the Monkey ) , looking like a serving of very angry calamari , and taking up the classy British slack that Rush left behind at the end of Part I . " Dead Man's Chest " makes no sense whatsoever , and it's not really even very fun . Even in a mindless action movie , one likes to have a vague idea of what all the fuss is about . So it pleases me to report that the third and ( maybe ? ) final entry , " At World's End , " gets more right than not , and provides a tremendous amount of fun . It doesn't even feel overly long , despite its run time of nearly three hours . The " Pirates " movies ' saving grace is the cast the filmmakers have assembled , and there are moments in this film , when the cast is all together at the same time , that rival " Star Wars " for sheer screen chemistry . Rush returns , so we get to enjoy both him and Nighy , and of course Johnny Depp is back , and returns to the inspired performance ( and surpasses the downright nuttiness ) that made the first installment so memorable . Chow-Yun Fat is this episode's most significant addition , but let's not dwell on him or the embarrassing Asian stereotype he hauls along behind him . There's a huge amount of jokey humour in this segment , perhaps the most in the series , which helps it succeed in becoming what one sensed it wanted to become all along - - a sort of Indiana Jones set on water . My prayers that the pre-pubescent Orlando Bloom would be killed off looked as if they might have a chance of being answered for a brief moment , until the writers cruelly resurrected him as a swarthy pirate captain and give him a dramatic entrance that gave me the biggest ( if most unintentional ) belly laugh of them all . Why is it that despite his swishing and mincing , Depp still gives the impression that he could kick Bloom's ass ? The " Pirates " trilogy will not go down as classics of the genre , but they'll be remembered for wedging themselves firmly in the consciousness of movie-going America . Grade : " Curse of the Black Pearl " : B " Dead Man's Chest " : " At World's End " :
574299	4532636	73582	4.0	Dull Horror Film Goes Nowhere	Unfortunately , it appears that I saw Dario Argento's best film , " Suspiria , " first , and none of the ones I've seen subsequently measure up to that one . All of the imagination Argento could muster for this serial killer story went in to staging a few elaborate and gruesome murder scenes . Too bad that all of the scenes connecting those moments are a dull bore . And the movie overstays its welcome by at least half an hour . What seemed novel in " Suspiria " begins to seem like limitations when you realize that Argento couldn't do anything else . His attention to style can only go so far in making up for the lack of good plotting , acting , character development and just about everything else that separates good films from bad ones .
573796	4532636	35279	5.0	Somebody Sabotaged This Film's Screenplay	I don't hear " Saboteur " talked about much in conversations about Hitchcock's films , and I can see why . It feels more like a product of a second-tier director filming in the style of Alfred Hitchcock than a movie directed by the master himself . Robert Cummings is the wronged man in this story , accused of sabotaging a war munitions plant . He takes off to find the real culprits , running into Priscilla Lane along the way and reenacting some scenes that felt stolen directly from Hitchcock's own " The 39 Steps . " The only thing resembling a Hitchcockian set piece is the film's climax that finds our hero and his nemesis dangling from the torch of the Statue of Liberty . What relegates this film to the Hitchcock bargain bin and renders it forgettable is its ridiculously implausible screenplay . It feels sloppy and frequently makes no sense whatsoever . And the film ends so abruptly that you're not even sure what happens to the main character , but in a way that doesn't feel intentional . I've yet to see a Hitchcock film that isn't at least entertaining , and this one is that , but it's certainly not among his classics .
574321	4532636	68555	5.0	Maybe the Only Film in History to Feature a Giant Rampaging Boob ?	Woody Allen's two previous films , " Take the Money and Run " and " Bananas , " had comedy-skit feels to them already , and in " Everything You Always Wanted to Know . . . . " he borrows even the comedy-skit format and breaks this film into several independent vignettes , each revolving around the topic of sex . Like any variety show , some of these skits are funnier than others ; the movie overall is pretty uneven , and isn't one of Allen's best efforts . My favorite skits were those depicting Allen himself as a neurotic sperm nervous about the voyage ahead , and a mad scientist spoof in which a giant breast escapes the laboratory and terrorizes a countryside , captured only when the townspeople manufacture a giant bra to catch it .
573664	4532636	380599	5.0	Missing the Polanski Touch	If you love " Oliver Twist " and want nothing more than a very straightforward retelling of the Dickens classic , you will be well served by this movie . If , however , you approach this because you're interested in what one of cinema's most interesting and accomplished directors will do with the subject matter , you may just be disappointed , as I was . This is a faithful but uninspired , and ultimately unnecessary , version of the story . Polanski's heart is in the right place , and one suspects that he LOVES this tale and didn't want to tamper with it . Fair enough . But if he loves it , he did it a disservice by removing so many of the elements that make Dickens ' stories so engaging . If nothing else , the characters should jump right off the screen in vivid and lively detail . However , Polanski manages to make all of them fade into the background and not one of them is memorable . Ben Kingsley's Fagin should be front and center ; ultimately , he's the one whom Dickens ' novel is about . It's Fagin that grows throughout the course of the story ; the moral arc of the tale rests on him . It's the opposition within Fagin between being a loyal father figure to his rag-tag bunch of boys and looking out for his own self interest that makes all of the action so interesting . But here , Fagin is relegated to a supporting role , and it doesn't feel like he has much impact on the story . Ditto Nancy . She emerged as a bawdy , vivacious life force in the novel . She was the mother figure to Fagin's boys and there was a burst of energy and fresh air whenever she entered the picture . In the movie , it's never made clear how large a role Nancy plays in the boys ' lives , so there's no real feeling of loss when she's gone . Here , the main character becomes Oliver , and that's Polanski's biggest mistake . In the novel Oliver Twist is a blank slate ; he only exists to give us a window into all of these situations and characters . He just lets things happen to him . In this regard , Polanski remains faithful , but he never should have made Oliver the true focus of his film . The movie looks great . It's dripping with period detail , and that alone makes it worth watching . It's also got a great atmospheric score by Rachel Portman . However , the visual design cannot make up for the tepid storytelling .
573924	4532636	328589	5.0	Saved By Diane Lane	Diane Lane is a fascinating actress to watch . Her face is always doing something interesting , and she has a winning , winsome quality to her that makes you automatically root for her . She takes the role she's given here and actually does things with it that other actresses probably couldn't . Otherwise , this film is the visual equivalent of Diet Soda : canned , bland and full of sugar . It should appeal to the Oprah crowd or people who love reality shows about people's homes being remodeled . It's harmless enough , but it has that sort of lazy , vapid quality that makes you wonder why anybody thought it was really worth turning into a movie in the first place .
573643	4532636	89173	5.0	Some Hate It , But I Think It's the Best in the Series	That wily rascal Jason Voorhees is at it again . . . . or is he ? Yes , this is the installment in the interminable " Friday the 13th " series that thought it would be a good idea to do without its only reason for existence . . . the hockey-masked Jason . Though you hardly notice the loss , since you don't KNOW it's not Jason until the film's final moments , and the copycat killer dresses like Jason anyway , so what's the difference ? If you've seen one axe-wielding psycho in a hockey mask , you've seen them all . Actually , I kind of like this entry . It provides the best nudity of the series . . . . no fewer than three gratuitous boob shots , and nice boobs they are . And it's funny , sometimes intentionally so , as when the hillbilly mom calls her dufus son a dildo , sometimes unintentionally , as when the Michael Jackson look alike sings a duet with his girlfriend through an outhouse wall while he's on the crapper . And the filmmakers outdo themselves with the body count this time around . By the end of the movie , there's no longer time to show them being killed off . Characters you've completely forgotten about just pop up as dead bodies . But what do you expect with all that plot to get through ? Compared to the other films in the series , this is practically " War and Peace , " what with the murder mystery story and the Tommy Jarvis plot line , which attempts to add a sense of continuity to the middle batch of movies ( o . k . so Part 6 picks up Tommy's storyline in a completely different place and with a different actor , but for a series like this that's the best you can hope for in the way of consistency ) .
573450	4532636	37800	5.0	Good Luck Getting the Theme Song Out of Your Head	" I Know Where I'm Going !

But if you're expecting a dazzling , vivid and energetic film like " The Red Shoes " or " Black Narcissus , " you're bound to be disappointed by this one . I couldn't get into this movie at all . The filmmakers seemed unable to settle on a tone or mood , so I wasn't ever sure if I was watching a romantic comedy or a darker , more psychologically complex character study . Wendy Hiller is good in her role , but her character drove me over the edge . I couldn't stand her - - bad news for a movie in which she's in virtually every scene . And that theme song . . . . . UGH ! To this day I have moments where that awful song plays on a constant loop through my mind , over and over and over . I really like Powell and Pressburger over all , so I choose to see this movie as an anomaly in their body of work rather than representative of it .

Both are in it solely for their dancing abilities , and really that's the whole reason for the film's existence , that and the opportunity to give us not one but two smash hit songs to perform at that year's Oscar ceremony .

573776	4532636	387877	5.0	Not As Bad As I Was Led to Believe , But No Grand Slam for DePalma	I didn't dislike this modern-day noir as much as many seemed to , but it's certainly no resounding success . Director Brian DePalma directs this big-screen version of the James Ellroy crime novel , itself a fictionalized account of the gruesome murder of Elizabeth Short , an aspiring actress who sadly found more fame in death than she would probably ever have had in life . The film focuses on two L . A . prizefighters turned detectives , played by the squinty-eyed Josh Hartnett and the chisel-jawed Aaron Eckhart , who find themselves wrapped up in an increasingly complex web of deception and murder . Eckhart becomes unnaturally obsessed with the investigation and slowly unravels , much to the dismay of Hartnett and Eckhart's girlfriend , the giant-bosomed Scarlett Johannson . As Eckhart becomes less reliable , Hartnett finds himself investigating the case on his own , and gets sexually involved with a spoiled society girl and sometime lesbian , played by the horse-toothed Hilary Swank . The plot becomes increasingly incomprehensible until it leads to a tidy finale in which the killer of Short reveals all in one of those " here's what happened " summaries that appeared at the end of every episode of " Murder She Wrote " but which doesn't manage to make anything all that much clearer . The confusing script didn't bother me all that much . Anyone who's seen a handful of films noir from the 1940s and 50s , films that DePalma is obviously trying to emulate , know that the plots of those rarely made a whole lot of sense . What bothered me was DePalma's inability to give his film a consistent tone . I couldn't tell if I was meant to take this film seriously as a crime thriller , or if I was meant to take it as a parody of film noir . At different times it's both of these . Hartnett , Johannson and Eckhart seem to think they should be taking everything deadly seriously , while Swank hams up a storm as the femme fatale , faking a hoity-toity aristocratic accent while stalking around dressed up as a 1940s version of Elvira . She at least has fun with the film , and I had fun with her , but she seems to be in a completely different movie . And Fiona Shaw , who has a small but crucial role as Swank's nutso mother , delivers a dreadful , ghastly performance that sends the film reeling into pure camp . Actually , if the film had stayed in the realm of camp , it would have been much better . Hartnett meets Swank in a lesbian night club where K . D . Lang croons a jazzy number to the accompaniment of a troop of glittery chorus girls . A scene in which Swank invites Hartnett to have dinner with her family is a jaw-dropper of bizarre black humor . A couple of set pieces , like the elaborate craning shot that begins with a shootout and sails over a rooftop to reveal Short's body being discovered in a field , or another action sequence that ends with two men plummeting to their deaths into a courtyard fountain , bring some welcome flashy stylistics to the film and interrupt its silly earnestness , but there's not enough of that . Hartnett is a blank spot at the center of the film , Eckhart is wasted , and Johannson can't do a thing with her poorly written character . Not only does the plot make no sense , but neither do the characters or their motivations . Actors just come and go seemingly at random , Hartnett sleeps with Swank , finds out she had sex with a woman once and freaks out ( though I'm not sure why ) , sleeps with Johannson , goes back to sleeping with Swank , all arbitrarily it would seem . There's an earthquake that doesn't have anything to do with anything else , and the first half hour of the film is devoted to the burgeoning friendship and boxing careers of Hartnett and Eckhart , 30 minutes I thought would become significant later on but never did . But despite all of this , I have to admit that DePalma did keep me watching , and I found myself able to enjoy the movie even while ticking off a long grocery list of its flaws .
573305	4532636	79710	5.0	One of Altman's Most Accessible Films Is Also One of His Least Interesting	Paul Dooley and Marta Heflin play a most decidedly IMperfect couple in Robert Altman's version of a romantic comedy . His claim at the time ( justified ) is that Hollywood had always allowed only beautiful people to fall in love , so he wanted to make a romance with a couple of ordinary folk . He succeeded when he found the paunchy Dooley and the distractingly skinny ( nearly anorexic ) Heflin for his leads , but the film itself is not much of a success . This came out during Altman's " experimental " period , meaning he threw together some disparate elements and hoped for the best . Actually , it's quite accessible for Altman , considering " Quintet " came out in the same year , and it's one of his least Altman-like projects . Unfortunately , it's those very qualities that also make it one of his least interesting and ugliest from a purely visual standpoint . The film does boast some good if dated music though , performed by the real-life band Keepin ' Em Off the Streets , led by Ted Neely , most known for playing the role of Jesus in the film version of " Jesus Christ Superstar " ( and whom I saw perform the role on stage in a touring version ) .
574224	4532636	97165	5.0	Please Don't Make Me Gag , Mr . Chips	A message about the value of non-conformity comes packaged in an utterly formulaic and treacly film . " Dead Poets Society " belongs to that genre of films about an unconventional teacher who becomes a major figure in the lives of his students . Usually these movies end with the teacher either dying or leaving his position for some reason or another , but almost invariably we must endure a scene where the music swells and his students applaud him in unison . Robin Williams stars as the teacher in this one , and the Academy gave him a Best Actor nomination because he cried .
574362	4532636	75995	6.0	Horseplay	What maybe came across as powerful on stage comes across as rather silly in this screen adaptation of the Peter Schaffer drama . Richard Burton plays a psychiatrist who is assigned the task of probing into the mind of a young man who mutilated ( by blinding ) a stable of horses . As he delves further and further into the mind of this troubled youth , we begin to realize that perhaps the lunatics are running the asylum . Credit is due to Richard Burton for restraining himself nicely in the role of the doctor . Dangling a role like this in front of a notorious hammy overactor like Burton is like throwing a bleeding whale into a tank full of hungry sharks . I was just waiting for the acting frenzy to begin . But Burton retains control of himself and does manage to deliver a fairly haunting performance . The most applause must go to Peter Firth in the role of the crazy young man , which he originated in the stage version . He's got a tough role , and not just because he must spend about half of his time buck naked , and some of THAT time riding a horse ( ouch ! ) . For those of you who complain that there's not enough male frontal nudity in films , " Equus " is the movie for you ( though it may not be the kind of nudity you're hoping for ) . Nevertheless , Firth gives a powerful performance that almost makes sense of the obtuse and psycho-babblish screenplay . Sidney Lumet is a fine director ; he's one of those film directors whose movies don't always necessarily work , but who you can be sure will at least make his movies interesting . " Equus " is no exception . Oh it's interesting all right , but it's also turgid and overheated . And be warned - - - if you don't like seeing harm come to animals in movies , the scene where Peter Firth's character blinds the horses leaves nothing to the imagination .
573611	4532636	97576	6.0	Far Behind " Raiders " and " Temple of Doom "	This third installment of the Indiana Jones saga has never done it for me , though I have to say it looks like a masterpiece compared to " Kingdom of the Crystal Skull . " There just aren't the fabulous set pieces in this one to distinguish it from the others , and the ending veers too far into hocus-pocus supernatural terrain for my taste . I know I'm supposed to be tickled to death by Sean Connery's fussy curmudgeon , but I just found him to be tedious instead . I do , however , like the opening scene , that shows River Phoenix playing a young Indiana Jones at the beginning of his adventurous career .
573303	4532636	480242	6.0	Steve Carell's Moping Can Be Hard to Take	A harmless romantic comedy that begins to fall apart the second you start actually thinking about what you've just seen . Steve Carell plays the single dad ( the mom died of some unnamed illness ) of three girls who intensely dislike him , who takes his daughters to a family reunion at his parents ' idyllic cabin in Rhode Island . There he finds out that his brother's new girlfriend ( the radiant Juliette Binoche ) is the same mystery woman he previously met and instantly fell in love with at a bookstore when he ran out on an errand . The rest of the film involves him acting like a baby because he can't have her , his entire family being disgusted with his behavior , and him realizing that though he makes a living out of giving people advice about how to get their lives together ( the title of the film refers to his newspaper column moniker ) , he can't do the same for himself . The whole movie suffers the fate of many a romantic comedy in the same vein - - it's amiable , but rather limp . Too much of it feels forced . The screenplay can't allow Juliette Binoche to be a real woman - - she has to be a romantic comedy love interest , otherwise known as the Most Wonderful Woman God Ever Created . Events that would realistically play out over several weeks are crammed into a two - or three-day timespan . This is especially apparent and awkward in a late scene involving some newspaper executives who come to interview Dan about taking his column into syndication ( they would really choose to come and meet with him while he's at a family reunion ? ) Dan's annoyingly perfect family has to share a group amphetamine addiction ; otherwise there is no way to account for the manic energy they have ( when they're not playing football or engaging in group exercise classes , they're planning talent shows ) . But mostly , and unfortunately , I thought the biggest flaw with the film was Carell himself . He moped to perfection in " Little Miss Sunshine , " but he's just aggravating here . I think we're meant to feel charmed and a bit heartbroken at seeing this man act like a petulant teenager , but I just wanted to tell him to get it together . The supporting cast is led by Dianne Wiest and John Mahoney as Dan's mom and dad , along with Dane Cook as his brother and Emily Blunt in a brief but memorable and sexy performance as a possible romantic alternative . However , everyone's talent is largely wasted . This is one of those unoffensive , unchallenging and uninteresting movies that's designed to give family crowds something to do when they tire of their Christmas shopping .
573930	4532636	109045	6.0	Am I the Only One Who Thinks Guy Pearce Makes a Hot Woman ?	The surprise indie hit about three drag queens who go on a voyage of self discovery . Hollywood liked it so much that it basically remade it as " To Wong Foo , Thanks for Everything , Julie Newmar , " with bigger names and a sanitized plot . Marketing for " Priscilla " makes it seem like a gay romp ( sorry , I couldn't resist ) , but it's not . It's actually a very serious and quite depressing film . These are not drag queens full of bravado and content to be who they are . These are men struggling with serious issues and to some extent using their female personas to hide . Yes , there are some disco numbers and lots of dazzling costumes , and yes , " I Will Survive " does make its appearance , but anyone coming to the movie thinking it's going to be a riot are sure to be disappointed . It boasts three great performances from Hugo Weaving , Terence Stamp and Guy Pearce , who particularly proves to the world how hot a woman he can be .
573912	4532636	439815	6.0	You Might Think Twice Before Ordering the Escargot	Nathan Fillion's engaging screen personality was largely responsible for making something special out of the potentially run-of-the-mill sci-fi movie " Serenity , " and that same personality does something similar for this film , the latest in the flesh-eating zombie genre . In " Slither , " a meteor from outer space deposits a gooey egg out in the middle of some woods , which a very unlucky regular Joe comes across one dark night while cavorting with a female companion . A quick moving critter makes a home out of this regular Joe's body , and through him impregnates the female companion . She experiences perhaps the worst pregnancy ever caught on film until she pops like a giant helium balloon , unleashing a horde of speedy slugs that begin taking over the minds and bodies of a whole townful of regular folk . Nathan Fillion , playing the sheriff of this once-quiet village , along with a small batch of survivors , struggle to put an end to the infestation and restore order to the galaxy . " Slither " keeps its tongue firmly in cheek , so if it's not a great movie , it's at least a fun and playful one . It's not remotely scary , but it doesn't try to be . It's gross , but in a stylized way that allows you to enjoy the gross out parts , unlike the gore that characterizes the new breed of torture porn films that are so inexplicably popular . It's a rather lazy movie really , with characters getting killed off when the script doesn't know what else to do with them , and with too many dramatic conflicts being too quickly and easily resolved . But when I sat down to watch this , I was really in the mood for something I wouldn't have to think too much about but that wouldn't insult my intelligence , and " Slither " delivered in both respects .
574437	4532636	23948	6.0	This Dinner Is Served Lukewarm	MGM , inventor of the all-star big-budget soap opera extravaganza , sought to follow up their smashing success , " Grand Hotel " ( 1932 ) , with another high-power ensemble film , and turned to this popular stage play for the material . If " Dinner at Eight " is ultimately not as satisfying as " Grand Hotel , " it's because director George Cukor does not take as cinematic an approach as Edmund Goulding . In " Grand Hotel , " the camera went sweeping around the vast interior of that film's magnificent set , and the viewer comes away from that movie remembering images as well as characters . Cukor takes a much more stagebound approach with his film , and visuals are too hampered by small and static sets . Even the actors perform as if on stage , pausing at their entrances for applause they would have received had they been performing in front of a live audience . And even though the cast is comprised of the best MGM had to offer at the time , it doesn't gel like the cast in " Grand Hotel " did . Lionel Barrymore uncharacteristically seems to be on shaky ground ; Billie Burke and her fussy performance are more distracting than funny ; and Jean Harlow and her on-again-off-again Southern accent are all wrong . One can't help but imagine what Ginger Rogers could have done with the Harlow part if only Rogers had been a big enough name when this film was released . Only Marie Dressler truly delights , so much so that whenever she isn't on screen , you fidget waiting for her to come back . As for the material itself , the play takes on some strong themes but handles them awkwardly . The set up seems to go on forever - - an hour into the film , I felt like the movie was still introducing characters and main plot threads . The ending has a hurried quality , as if the screenwriters decided they had spent all of their time on plot set up and couldn't afford any for actual resolutions . If the film is faithful to the play , the play must have been a fairly minor one . So , certainly not a bad film by any means , and worth seeing for some of the most famous names in the early ' 30s , but it doesn't surprise me that the movie hasn't had the longevity of " Grand Hotel . "
573737	4532636	89853	6.0	I Always Miss Woody Allen When He's Not in His Own Movies	One of Woody Allen's trifles that entirely hinges on a gimmick - - in this one , a dowdy starstruck woman in Depression-era New York ( Mia Farrow ) finds herself flustered when her favorite matinée idol movie star ( Jeff Daniels ) jumps off the screen and joins her in the real world . The film obviously sets out to capture in literal terms the figurative idea of " falling in love " with the movies , and it succeeds on its own modest terms , but those terms are very modest . I never like Allen's movies as much when he's not actually in them , and that's the case here . Though Mia Farrow adds yet one more versatile character to her resume , a far cry from the blowzy broad she had played the year before in Allen's " Broadway Danny Rose . "
574339	4532636	385004	6.0	A Less Satisfying " Hero "	Zhang Yimou's follow up to his 2002 " Hero " is a lesser film in just about every way . It forsakes the grander themes of the earlier movie for a more personal , character-driven story about love and passion that at its best is just silly and at its worst a bit of a snoozer . Yimou's skill does not lie in creating really compelling characters ; he should stick with his gorgeous visuals and dance-like fight choreography . Only once - - during a scene in an atmospheric bamboo forest - - does this movie take flight , figuratively and literally . I have to say for much of the rest of the time I thought it was fairly boring .
574108	4532636	358273	6.0	Same Old , Same Old	" Walk the Line " is a warmed over version of " Ray , " trotted out just in time for Oscar consideration , shrewd timing since the Academy never saw a biopic it didn't like . The problem is that " Walk the Line " is inferior to " Ray " in just about every way , and I wasn't even a huge fan of the latter picture . If you don't know anything about Johnny Cash , or what it was about his music that makes him such a legendary figure , you won't learn it here . As played by Joaquin Phoenix in a horribly mannered performance , Cash started out his career barely able to function from one day to the next , and never really improved until the love of a good woman ( enter June Carter ) turned him around . Phoenix's performance is one-note , all mumbled lines and eye-rolling freak out scenes . There's absolutely nothing interesting about Cash in this version of events , and there's no explanation of what it was about him that June Carter was so drawn to . Reese Witherspoon gives the better performance , but the material she's given limits the impact she can make . Johnny and June's relationship is muddled and ambiguous . I could never tell whether they were involved or not until his final freak out scene when he clumsily gets her to agree to marry him ( don't even ask me why she'd want to ) . The biggest tragedy of this movie is that it doesn't provide any insight into what made Cash a genius , or how the demons he was working through influenced the kind of music he wanted to make . Tepid as I thought " Ray " was , it at least accomplished that much . I've heard some people say that the performances in " Walk the Line " are better than the movie itself . Revise that to read Reese Witherspoon's performance is better than the movie , and I'll agree .
574499	4532636	80716	6.0	Silly , Contrived , But Somehow Lovable	Nobody broke out into spontaneous song and dance at my high school . Of course , I also didn't go to Juilliard . " Fame " was a sort of transition film , bridging the gap between the more traditional movie musicals of the 1960s and 70s and the MTV-style musicals of the 1980s . In " Fame , " characters do break into song , but when they do , the song looks more like a music video than anything else . Some of those songs are terrific ( like the iconic title number performed by Irene Cara ) , and some are just stupid , like the lunchroom number . The movie is full of hot-button issues and melodramatic subplots that would make any tweener salivate , but the film is nearly impossible to take seriously once you're past the age of , say , 25 . Still , it's directed with a fair amount of style by Alan Parker , and it goes down easily enough .
573844	4532636	829459	6.0	" A Mighty Heart " Is Lacking Just That	Though based on a horrifying and tragic event , " A Mighty Heart " is a strangely unmoving film . Director Michael Winterbottom throws plenty of details at us about the investigation into the kidnapping of journalist Daniel Pearl by radical Muslims in Pakistan , and the film plays almost like a documentary , even copping the documentary look with lots of hand-held camera shots and jump-cut editing . But the human story gets buried underneath the complex web of details , and despite a solid performance from Angelina Jolie as Pearl's remarkably stoic wife Mariane , I wasn't much moved by the film . Winterbottom doesn't display a lot of skill at making the details coherent to his audience , and I'm not sure even now who all of the players were or what role they played . He assumes that everyone will already come to the film knowing the story of Daniel and Mariane Pearl , and while I knew the general outline , I wasn't aware of all the specifics , and this film doesn't help . It recreates the feeling of coming into a T . V . series after having missed the opening episode , and trying to digest material without being able to put it into context .
574525	4532636	434124	6.0	As Kinky as Sunday School	This fuzzy , feel-good message movie tells the tale of Charlie Price ( Joel Edgerton ) , a strait-laced , uptight fellow from the English village of Northampton , who inherits his father's shoe factory . He doesn't really want to make shoes , but feels obligated to continue his late and beloved father's legacy . The business starts to founder , and Charlie feels helpless to save it , until he meets Lola , a drag queen ( Chiwetel Ejiofor ) who inspires him to save the company by venturing into the niche market of boots made specifically for male cross dressers . The film claims to be inspired by a true story ( what film doesn't , these days ? ) and given its premise , it would have to be . There are some minor conflicts , but nothing gets too serious , and the happy ending , which you can call from a mile away , of course features Ejiofor and his troop of drag queen friends belting out showy songs set to disco beats . The movie is only half-baked , lots of details are left somewhat vague , everyone seems to be only going through the emotions to a certain extent , and Ejiofor makes one of the scariest women I've ever seen . But the film's message about being true to yourself and accepting others for what they are can never , in my opinion , be told enough , and though it's flimsy and lightweight , the movie is also entertaining and harmless enough .
573484	4532636	449467	6.0	An Exhausting Film	Alas , it appears that , based on other user comments here at IMDb , I am in the minority on this film . I found it to be tedious and exhausting , and the effort I put into sticking with it far outweighed any sense of closure I received from it . Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu appeared at the screening I saw and introduced his film as the final entry in a trilogy that includes " Amores Perros " and " 21 Grams . " Inarritu , in a comment that surprised me , said that his intent with this trilogy was not to focus on politics or social commentary , but rather to look at the modern family and what it means to be a father , son , mother , daughter , etc . This may have been his intention , but I don't feel that over the course of three entire films Inarritu did say much about these issues . Instead , he has painted a portrait of the world as he apparently sees it as a pretty bleak , uncaring and unforgiving place to live . I thought " Amore Perros " was so pessimistic as to border on nihilism ; " 21 Grams " came closer to finding a sense of peace and redemption among the general human crappiness . " Babel " sticks closer to the sentiments of the first film than the latter . " Babel " is of course about communication , or more exactly miscommunication , in the modern world . It's a theme that has engaged the interest of many a filmmaker lately - - the idea that technology has made instant communication so much easier , yet people seem to be more than ever incapable of understanding one another . It's a conceit that greatly interests me , but Inarritu doesn't exploit its potential here . " Babel " consists of a monotonous series of scenes in which people shout , storm , fight and talk over one another , always in a hurry to be understood without taking the time to understand . Very well , point taken . But Inarritu makes this point within the film's first half hour - - you only need see one or two scenes of this kind of frustrating verbal gridlock to understand what he's trying to say ; after that , the frustration just mounts without any kind of pay off . People are mean to one another , some are unbelievably callous ( I didn't buy for a second that the group of tourists who accompany Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's characters to a remote Moroccan village after Blanchett is accidentally shot would be so uncaring as Inarritu depicts them ) . In Inarritu's world , all authority figures are to be justifiably feared , as they go around beating everybody up and pulling guns on innocent people . There's no nuance here ; Inarritu pounds his message into you . For example , he obviously feels strongly about the mistreatment of illegal immigrants , especially those from Mexico , but instead of engaging in an intelligent debate about the topic , he sets up such an implausible , not to mention one-sided , scenario in this film that you can't help but agree with him . The biggest disappointment in " Babel " is his failure to fully utilize a couple of wonderful actors he has assembled . Cate Blanchett is utterly wasted as the caustic American wife whose shooting sets off the chain of events . And Gael Garcia Bernal likewise gets nothing to do as a hot-headed Mexican whose attempts to run from border patrol creates a sad ending for one of the major characters . Brad Pitt does better than expected with the frenzied , frustrated husband of Blanchett . But these people have no history . We know virtually nothing about anybody in the film , yet are expected to care deeply about what happens to them . Maybe that's part of Inarritu's point - - that we're all connected to one another even if we don't know it , and that the world has become so small that there are no longer such things as strangers in it . But this is a film narrative , not real life , and you can't build a compelling one out of anonymous characters . After " 21 Grams " I thought I was warming up to Inarritu , but this film has sent me back to the detractors ' camp . He certainly knows how to put a movie together , and he finds engaging ways to tell his stories . But his attitudes and approach to the modern world are so depressing and fatalistic that his films push me away rather than draw me in .
573810	4532636	90305	6.0	Brings New Meaning to " Made to Order "	I haven't seen this movie for a long time , so for all I know it's horrible , but I have nothing but good memories of it . Any red-blooded American male has to at least appreciate the premise : two horny teens discover a way to create the perfect woman , who exists for no other purpose than to fulfill their every fantasy . Hot damn ! ! Their perfect woman is Kelly Le Brock , who wouldn't necessarily be my choice , but she'll do . John Hughes was on a roll with his teen comedy genre , and this film preserves the memorable performances of Anthony Michael Hall and a young Bill Paxton as the world's most obnoxious older brother .
573686	4532636	44672	6.0	Not Quite a Train Wreck ( Though There's One in the Movie )	If you want to do a garish , ponderous epic , Cecil B . is your man , as he proves with this " Ten Commandments " - sized circus story . " The Greatest Show on Earth " represents just about everything bad about 1950s film-making , but it also happens to be one enjoyable howler of a movie . DeMille always seemed to know that his movies were destined for camp , and there's always that sense that he's laughing at his earnest spectacles right along with you . Give me " The Greatest Show on Earth " over " Ben-Hur , " or any other number of oh-so-serious Hollywood epics , any day . There was no excuse for DeMille to inflict Betty Hutton on audiences a mere 2 years after her migraine-inducing performance in " Annie Get Your Gun , " but she's about the worst you'll have to contend with in this movie . As usual , Charlton Heston's acting is so bad it's good and Cornel Wilde looks like a plastic action figure of himself . Gloria Grahame single-handedly infuses the picture with some much-needed va-va-voom , and she has more chemistry with the elephant she's paired with in one scene that any of the rest of the cast has with each other . James Stewart shows up as a homicidal doctor disguised as a clown ( I'm not kidding ) , and fills the role of the obligatory prestige actor that all such trashy ensemble films must have ( think Fred Astaire in " The Towering Inferno " or Helen Hayes in " Airport " ) . The film is ugly as all get-out ; the Technicolor looks terrible , and the costumes are tawdry . There's nothing to distinguish the entire production except for the entire cast's apparent commitment to the material and DeMille's belief that this kind of movie is worth caring about . He's such a capable , if not especially artistic director , that he almost succeeds in convincing you that it is . Plus , there's a really cool train wreck at the end .
574252	4532636	38348	6.0	Good , But Not as Magical as Some Claim	I can't believe I'm about to say this , but I preferred the animated Disney version of this story to the 1946 Jean Cocteau film . I'm no Disney fan , and I would personally like to stop them from taking over the world ( along with Starbucks ) , but this is one case where I just thought they instilled this fairy tale with more magic . I missed the character of Gaston in the Cocteau version , and I missed also the delightful assortment of animated objects . And I think this story is particularly conducive to being set to music , and I enjoyed the songs in the Disney version . However , on its own terms , the 1946 release is well done , and considered by many to be the definitive version of the beauty / beast tale . I thought the acting was bland , though Belle is indeed a beauty . And there are moments of pure movie magic : the candelabras that light Belle's way , the fireplace that watches her father eat . And for once slow motion is used in a way that doesn't feel cliché . But the relationship between Belle and the Beast isn't well developed . You don't see Belle falling in love with him over the course of the film , and when she professes her love at the end , it seems to come out of thin air . And was I the only one confused by the transformation at the end ? It doesn't get explained well at all . Though it is kind of funny at how blase Belle is when the Beast becomes a hunk and says she'll have to get used to his new face . The film is interesting in that it acknowledges the Beast's animalistic nature . He hunts wild game , he craves blood , and more than once you wonder whether or not he'd rather eat Belle than court her . There's a violent eroticism underlying this film , that I found surprising for the year it was released . I know Cocteau asks his audience at the film's beginning to watch the film with the eyes of a child and to give itself over to the enchantment of fairy tales , and I have no problem doing that . But even so , I felt like he was using fairy tale logic to explain away things that could have been explained better .
574258	4532636	29162	6.0	Kinda Creepy	In " Lost Horizon , " a change of pace for director Frank Capra , a charter plane carrying a group of character actors crashes somewhere over Asia , and they stumble their way into the forgotten city of Shangri-La , tucked cosily away amid the snowy mountains , where the cadaverous H . B . Warner prowls around in bare feet and a kimono . Shangri-La seems like an ideal place to while away one's hours , not the least because of its groovy art-deco production design , but before long everyone starts to get bored with how nice and bland the inhabitants are , and creeped out by Warner's ability to materialize out of nowhere at the most inopportune moments ( he's definitely what " Seinfeld's " Elaine would call a sidler ) . " Lost Horizon " is actually sort of poky and dull , and I was fairly disinterested in what happened to the characters by the time the movie was over . There's a love story between Ronald Colman and a pretty young thing who gets a hankering to leave the peaceful place - - her storyline contributes to the movie's overall creepiness - - is she being held there against her will ? But ultimately this love story is same old , same old , all melodramatic swooning and fuzzy closeups . My favorite performance came from Thomas Mitchell , who excelled at playing loud-mouthed obnoxious Americans , and does the same honors here . Kudos to Capra for trying something a little different ; too bad the result was a rather hum-drum movie .
574223	4532636	97239	6.0	Don't Be a Back Seat Driver , Miss Daisy	" Driving Miss Daisy " is so quiet and genteel that it threatens to evaporate right off the screen . The source material is well written and carries with it a certain poignancy and power , but one suspects that it carried even more power on stage . The impression left by the film is that director Bruce Beresford had trouble filling out the screen . He does get nice performances from his actors , though , especially Jessica Tandy as the title character , a privileged white woman through whose unique perspective we see the gradual changes wrought by the civil rights movement . Morgan Freeman is her chauffeur , and he does the gentle sage routine that seemed fresh at the time because we hadn't yet realized that that's all he would do for the next twenty years . And Dan Aykroyd takes an uncharacteristic stroll through more dramatic terrain as Miss Daisy's son . " Driving Miss Daisy " is a pleasant enough movie , but the fact that it won the 1989 Academy Award for Best Picture , more than emphasizing the quality of this particular film , points out the lack of quality of everything else that year .
573478	4532636	279113	6.0	So-So Dramatic Vehicle for Aniston	" The Good Girl " was heavily touted as the film that would help Jennifer Aniston break from her Rachel persona and make the leap to dramatic film actress . There was even talk ( however brief ) about an Academy Award nomination for her when this film came out . Surprise , surprise , but that didn't happen . And where has Aniston's film career been since ? " The Good Girl " is leaps and bounds better than any of Aniston's other ventures into film - - bland crap like " Picture Perfect " and that other movie whose name I can't even remember - - but it's not a great movie in and of itself . Aniston does a pretty good job , but you still can't escape the suspicion that she's just playing Jennifer Aniston , albeit a drabbed down version of herself . This movie's greatest asset is its supporting cast , particularly Zooey Deschanel in a very funny , dead pan role as a fellow worker at the Wal-Mart-esquire store Aniston's character works in , and Jake Gyllenhaal , who had begun his trek to stardom the year before in " Donnie Darko . " The gods were being kind to Gyllenhaal in 2002 , as he got to make out with both Aniston and Catherine Keener ( " Lovely and Amazing " ) in the same year . " The Good Girl " is certainly worth watching . It captures that nowheresville feeling of small-town America perfectly , the antithesis of every Frank Capra movie on the same subject . Instead of a cosy town where everyone knows your name , these towns are instead full of bored , restless people sitting around waiting for something , anything , to happen .
573943	4532636	493459	7.0	Entertaining , But Not as Scathing as It Could Have Been	Kirby Dick's expose of the MPAA's ratings process only confirms the suspicion that motion picture ratings are virtually worthless , arbitrarily assigned by an elite panel who purport to have our country's children's best interests at heart , but who seem to think that an exposed breast is more harmful to them than seeing a gunshot to the head . It's absolutely infuriating that the country's churches have a seat on the ratings boards and a say in what content is or is not suitable for consumption . It's infuriating that an NC-17 rating exists at all ( the board is essentially usurping the judgement and decision-making abilities of parents ) , but doubly infuriating that it's used as a punishment to " encourage " filmmakers to alter their films so that they're more palatable for mainstream film goers . For a while I was kind of sad that home video and the Internet seems to be supplanting movie theatres as the preferred venue for watching films , but now I appreciate the democratizing effect of companies like Netflix and Blockbuster , who have made great filmmakers less reliant on corporate theatre chains to get their films distributed and seen . As a documentary , " This Film Is Not Yet Rated " is rather disorganized . Dick has good points to make , but their impact is blunted by tangents and off-topic tirades . Dick hires a private detective to track down the identities of the ratings board , and spends far too much of his 96 minutes following the details of that investigation . On the plus side , it's great to see directors and actors like Kimberly Peirce , Maria Bello and John Waters given a venue to vent their frustrations at the ratings practice . One of the main points Dick makes , and one I heartily agree with , is that the ratings board focuses far more energy on censoring sex in films than they do violence , a point that is unintentionally driven home by none other than the ratings board chairman herself towards the film's climax . Dick asks why his documentary received an NC-17 rating and she cites the sexual content that appears in some of the clips of films that have received NC-17 ratings sprinkled throughout the documentary . She seems to have no problem with some of the very violent content included in clips from some of those very same movies . What an idiot .
574079	4532636	63374	7.0	Winning Pair in a Slight Neil Simon Effort	There's nothing really to dislike about " The Odd Couple , " and it's no surprise that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau make a hugely winning comedic team . But there's something so underdeveloped about Neil Simon's adaptation of his hit stage play as to make it seem more like a skit on a sketch comedy show than a full-bodied film . I have not seen the play , but have to assume that the screen version is fairly faithful , since Simon wrote it , so the defects cannot be blamed on a stage-to-screen adaptation . There are some interesting ideas in this story - - two recently divorced men who fall immediately into traditional married roles when they become roommates because neither knows any differently - - that Simon never fully fleshes out . Still , there are many worse ways to kill a couple of hours .
573702	4532636	41546	7.0	Not the Comedy Masterpiece So Many Claim	Those who come to " Kind Hearts and Coronets " because of the reputation of Alec Guinness's performance ( or rather performances ) may find themselves disappointed in this dark comedy from Britain's Ealing studios . Not because Guinness's performance is bad , but because there's much less of it than admirers would have you believe . Guinness has nowhere nearly as much screen time as Dennis Price , who plays a vengeful family outcast who decides to murder the eight other family members standing between him and a dukeship . Though Guinness plays all eight of the doomed relatives , he doesn't get much time as any of them , and he doesn't give them the colorful characterizations I was expecting . The film is humorous at times , but quite slow and even rather boring at others . It's capped by a clever ending , but overall the movie is not the masterpiece it's been hyped up to be .
573541	4532636	407265	7.0	Huffman Better Than the Movie	A surprisingly vanilla film given its subject matter , " Transamerica " would be as at home in a TV movie-of-the-week line up as it is on the big screen at your local multiplex ( o . k . so maybe a made-for-television movie on HBO - - I don't think CBS is quite ready for this ) . Duncan Tucker has taken a unique premise and turned it into a standard formula road-trip picture , tricked out with all of the obligatory touchy-feely heart-warming moments that such a film requires . The results are generally entertaining , though the film does teeter once or twice on the brink of out-and-out awfulness . THE reason to see this movie , no surprise , is Felicity Huffman's performance as Bree , the pre-op transsexual who finds out a week before her sexual reassignment surgery that she has a son . The movie wastes no time in setting up its premise , and the whole thing breezes along amiably , only hinting at the true stark and confused emotions people put in the situations these people are put into would actually have . Tucker opts for comedy instead of seriousness whenever possible , which certainly makes the film more palatable but also gives it a feeling of insignificance . Huffman , though , rises above any limitations in the script or direction to deliver a bravura performance in a role I never in a million years would have thought she'd be well cast in . Huffman is a pretty , feminine actress , so the fact that she is able to pull off this strange-looking , masculine hybrid is a testament to her acting abilities . Of course , her performance wouldn't be nearly as effective if it was focused on superficialities alone , and it's Huffman's ability to breathe full life into Bree , creating a three-dimensional , lovable , caring , yet flawed character rather than a symbol or caricature , that most impresses . " Transamerica " is a case of the material not being up to the standard of the actress delivering it .
574197	4532636	43625	7.0	John Garfield Runs All the Way	This strange entry in the noir canon features John Garfield delivering a sweaty , paranoid performance as a small-time crook who shoots a cop during a heist gone bad and then holes up with the family of a girl he meets and desperately latches himself on to ( Shelley Winters ) . He virtually takes the family hostage , threatening to kill whichever member he has with him at the time if any of the other members try to seek help . Meanwhile , a game of patriarchal dominance begins between Garfield and the father , whose sense of masculinity is threatened by his inability to help his family . It all leads to a showdown in the street as Garfield attempts to run away with Winters , who may or may not have genuine feelings for him . " He Ran All the Way " is more about the dynamics of family than anything else . In the first scene , we see what kind of home life Garfield's character comes from . His blowsy mom ( played divinely by Gladys George , who has far too little screen time ) verbally and physically abuses him , and then refuses to come to his aid later on when he's in trouble . As a result , Garfield tries to make a sort of surrogate family of the one he's taken hostage , attempting to establish a twisted kind of domestic tranquility , with himself as father figure . The most unsettling scene transpires at a family dinner , when Garfield forces the family at gunpoint to eat the meal he's prepared for them . Throughout the film , Garfield acts with a desperate intensity you can practically smell . Unlike all of those cooler than cool crooks who populate the worlds of other noir films , Garfield is lousy as a criminal ; his own paranoia and panic give him away at moments when he otherwise wouldn't be in any danger . Shelley Winters plays his love interest as a dowdy mope , the second time that year ( see " A Place in the Sun " ) she played a frump who meets a good-looking lad and then regrets it . Wallace Ford and Selena Royle do the honors as mom and dad . " He Ran All the Way " is not one of the more ambitious entries in the noir cycle , but like so many of the lurid , low-budget films that came out around this fertile period in cinema history , it has fascinating undertones that belie its simple plot . With crisp photography by James Wong Howe and a propulsive , sensational score by that old pro Franz Waxman .
574271	4532636	30287	7.0	Look Out Tara , Bette's on the Loose	Bette Davis sashays her way through the role of a Southern spitfire belle , proving that maybe she wouldn't have been such a bad choice for Scarlett O'Hara after all . Actually , though " Jezebel " is compared frequently to " Gone with the Wind " ( understandably , since the latter came out just a year later ) , it doesn't have much in common other than its Civil War-era setting and an unconventional woman as the main character . In any other comparison of the two , " Jezebel " will inevitably lose , because if " Wind " occasionally stumbles into bad day-time drama territory , " Jezebel " plunges right in and never emerges . This is no fault of Bette's though . She can only do so much with the character given her to play , but what she does with it is a lot . The moment she bursts on to the screen wearing riding gear and brandishing a riding crop ( ! ) , she takes command of the screen and refuses to let go , putting those enormous eyes to swooning effect . The crux of the story rests on whether or not this little frivolous tart will stay true to her limp noodle suitor ( Henry Fonda ) , who drags every party down with all of his talk about politics , or whether she'll dump him . When he contracts scarlet fever during an epidemic sweeping the area , will she stay with him as he's moved to a quarantine camp , putting herself at risk , or will she instead go off cavorting in a meadow with the first beefy country boy who comes along ? What do you think happens ? Ah well , movies like this are fun even if they're silly and not very good . Old pro William Wyler does a fine job , and one suspects that the movie could have been much worse if directed by someone with less skill . Watch for Bette Davis , if for no other reason . And really , what other reason do you need ?
573887	4532636	87469	7.0	Hokier Than " Raiders , " But Still a Good Time	Hokier and jokier than its predecessor , " Raiders of the Lost Ark , " " Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom " gives us a pretty good idea of what Steven Spielberg would be like if he were hopped up on amphetamines . " Raiders " felt like it was full of non-stop action until you see this movie , which barely pauses to catch its breath . It's not as good as " Raiders , " but I always enjoy it . Kate Capshaw is the film's biggest liability - - in the scene where she's being lowered into a fiery pit and Indiana is trying to save her , I always root for the fire . But the film has dazzling set pieces , some of them , like a breakneck race through a mine shaft , that rival or even outdo those in " Raiders . "
573343	4532636	53125	7.0	Not One of My Favorite Hitchcock Films	I've found this admittedly classic Hitchcock entry a bit tough to warm up to on multiple viewings . I enjoyed it very much the first time I saw it , but I don't want to revisit it the way I like revisiting " Rear Window , " " Psycho " or " The Birds . " Almost every Hitchcock film has at least one classic set piece that everyone remembers , and this film has at least two : the crop duster sequence , in which Cary Grant is pursued across an empty field by a sinister plane ( very creepy ) and the breathtaking climax on Mt . Rushmore . Eva Marie Saint plays the Hitchcock blonde in this one , but you'll be hard pressed to even remember that she's in the movie .
573476	4532636	27977	7.0	Individual Parts Greater Than the Whole	One of this movie's most famous images - - Chaplin sliding around inside the gears and cogs of a monstrous machine - - provides a handy visual to go along with my opinion of the film in general : there are individual cogs that I remember as being brilliant , but when put together they don't make a totally satisfying machine . Unlike " City Lights " or " The Gold Rush " before , or " The Great Dictator " after , I didn't get caught up in the narrative of " Modern Times , " and I felt there were longer gaps between the funny bits . However , some of the set pieces in this are hilarious , most notably the scene where Chaplin finds himself strapped into an automatic feeding machine that goes berserk ; and a nimble scene on roller skates that showcases his athleticism . Sadly , " Modern Times " was an all too applicable metaphor for Chaplin's place in the film industry . New technologies were beginning to make his artistry obsolete , and the sadness of that is palpable in the film's final shot . I'm recommending " Modern Times " because it's a very good movie . I just didn't think it was as good as some of Chaplin's other well-known projects .
574262	4532636	27996	7.0	Dress Rehearsal for " Mr . Smith Goes to Washington "	It's funny how common it was for directors in the 30s to remake their own movies , sometimes no more than a few years after they made the original . " Mr . Smith Goes to Washington " isn't exactly a remake of " Mr . Deeds , " but it sure bears more than a merely striking resemblance to Capra's earlier film . The idea of an idealistic everyman standing up to a bullying bureaucracy is central to both films , but " Mr . Smith " is the darker and more bitter of the two . As a result , " Mr . Deeds " is sunnier and more fun , but also feels less substantial . Nothing wrong with the actors though . Jean Arthur is one of my favorite actresses from this time period . She was cute and flirty , but never in a self-conscious or cloying way . And Gary Cooper , despite his towering presence and good looks , excels at playing an everyday Joe who doesn't want a life of complicated wealth thrust on him when a rich relative dies and leaves him his inheritance . Frank Capra wasn't a very versatile director , and he was rather obsessed with one theme that he revisited time and again , but what he chose to do he did very well .
574473	4532636	35567	7.0	A Hepburn / Tracy Debut	Watching this first pairing of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn , it's easy to see why the two became a legendary screen couple ( and real-life couple for that matter ) . They seem perfectly suited for one another , and you can't imagine either of them with anyone else . But it's hard from a 21st Century sensibility not to be appalled at this WWII-era George Stevens dramedy . Tracy is a sports writer and Hepburn an international reporter for the same newspaper . They meet , marry and fight when she won't abandon her career to settle down into dutiful motherhood . In the end , she gets her comeuppance and realizes that what she wants more than anything is to learn how to separate eggs and make coffee . Try to forgive it its decidedly un-feminist message though . This came out at a time when the culture was particularly threatened by the idea of women supplanting men in areas traditionally reserved for men , and it wouldn't have been good for soldier morale for men to think women back at home could carry on just fine without them . And at the very end , Tracy does come around and tell Hepburn that he doesn't necessarily want a barefoot and pregnant version of a wife any more than he wants a career-oriented wife who will put her work before her home , but rather wishes she could be something in between . As things play out in the film , this comes as too little too late , but it's a sophisticated attitude for the time and makes the movie much more relevant today , when women are being forced to juggle multiple roles . Overall I enjoyed this movie , but I thought it was strangely directed by Stevens . I usually enjoy his 40s comedies , but his instincts feel off here . The way he chooses to shoot scenes many times seem in tone to be at odds with what's actually happening in them , so I wasn't always sure what was supposed to be light-hearted and funny and what wasn't . A striking example of this comes in the scene in which Tracy comes back to Hepburn's apartment after their first date . It's supposed to be an erotic and sexually charged scene , but it's shot like a film noir , with Hepburn silhouetted against brightly lit windows and the room in sinister shadow . There's a ponderousness to Stevens ' direction that serves as a sneak preview of his prevailing style in the 50s , when he started to make socially " important " movies . A solidly made but uneven film . If you're expecting a frothy comedy you will be disappointed .
573913	4532636	45555	7.0	Don't Let Gloria Grahame Make the Coffee	Since I love film noir , I enjoyed " The Big Heat , " but I didn't feel that it distinguished itself from any number of other similar films from the same time period . This surprised me somewhat , as I don't think of Fritz Lang as an anonymous director , and he's usually able to imprint a strong visual style on his films . Not so for this story about a good and honest cop ( Glenn Ford ) who's dragged into the seedy underworld after his wife dies in a booby trap meant for him . Many of the themes common to this genre are present here : the blurred lines between the criminals and the law , the insidious encroachment of the scary city on the peaceful idyll of the wholesome suburb . It also picked up a main theme from " The Asphalt Jungle " : cops and robbers alike have families and lives separate from their work , and this fact makes them more like one another than they might want to admit . This film is most notable for a feisty performance from Gloria Grahame , who plays a gangster's moll who gets tired of being used and abused by her thug of a boyfriend ( a repulsive Lee Marvin ) and gets her scalding revenge . I've always felt that Grahame was never really used to her fullest potential by any film director , but she has such a strong screen presence that she's able to make this film all about her .
573593	4532636	1093824	7.0	Herzog Heads to the South Pole	Werner Herzog travels to Antarctica to film a colony of scientists going about their work with seals , penguins , volcanoes and the breathtaking sea life of this lesser known part of the world . This film is not the warning about global warming that you might expect , though the topic of global warming and man's future on this planet does come up . Nor do we , the audience , learn much about the scientists ' findings . Herzog traveled to this unpopulated part of the world where people drift when they want to get away from civilization , but the film seems more interested in these recluses than it does the environment to which they devote their time . This isn't that surprising , really . Herzog has always been interested in the human psyche and the motives that drive eccentrics to do the things they do . There's the sense in this film that Herzog has found himself among a batch of kindred spirits , and by learning what makes them tick may learn a little something about himself . The funniest part of the film is Herzog's interview of the taciturn penguin scientist . Watching the man's face as he tries to formulate answers to questions like " Can penguins be gay ? " and " Can penguins go insane ? " is worth the price of admission .
573974	4532636	41090	7.0	Another Tracy / Hepburn Boxing Match	Another in the long line of him vs . her domestic feuds that made Tracy and Hepburn a famous screen pair . " Adam's Rib " isn't as good as their first pairing , " Woman of the Year , " though its attitudes about women may be a good deal more palatable to a modern day audience . But it's still a fun movie - - it probably wouldn't be much if Tracy and Hepburn weren't in it , but they ARE in it , and they display their usual chemistry . With a small role for Judy Holliday , who would win that year's Best Acress Oscar for a much bigger role , that of Billie Dawn in " Born Yesterday . "
574342	4532636	37865	7.0	Beautifully Shot 40's Corn	" Leave Her to Heaven " came out during a period when Hollywood was totally jazzed about psychological illness , its effects and its treatment . Two of the Academy Award best picture nominees from 1945 ( the year of " Heaven's " release ) were " The Lost Weekend " and " Spellbound , " both dealing with some sort of mental psychosis . Of course , those movies focused on the ability of their respective protagonists to get better ; " Leave Her to Heaven " includes the looniness , but leaves out the treatment part . Gene Tierney as Ellen comes about as close to serious acting as she ever would during her career , which isn't very close but is passable enough . She has a couple of effective scenes , namely the one in which she coldly watches her brother-in-law drown , but mostly the impact of her character is minimized by her obligation to always be beautiful . The plot is one of those corny , melodramatic 40's concoctions , in which the film goes around the world and back again to provide a happy ending that seems completely out of place . There are some hintings of psycho-babble about Ellen's too close attachment to her father and her tendency to destroy what she loves , but the film knows its limitations enough not to stray too far away from good old-fashioned sordid melodrama . Its ' an enjoyable enough movie if you don't take it too seriously , with absolutely gorgeous cinematography that won the film its lone Oscar . The other actors are negligible : Cornel Wilde looks plastic-y and Jeanne Crain does her pert , wholesome American gal thing . No one else really registers . The score is over-used and makes several scenes unintentionally silly . But , I repeat , an entertaining film if you approach it with the right expectations - - - in other words , don't expect a masterpiece and you'll do just fine .
573744	4532636	90329	7.0	When Worlds Collide	This solid thriller stars Harrison Ford , given his first chance to truly act , as a detective who must infiltrate an Amish community in order to protect a little boy who accidentally witnessed a murder . Director Peter Weir and his screenwriter use the story as an opportunity to examine the culture clash between the modern world and the peaceful , insular world of the Amish . Ford's detective brings with him the violence and aggression of the outside world , but he also brings an understanding to the Amish , and especially to the mother of the little boy ( played by Kelly McGillis ) , that at heart he's not much different than they are , even if their cultures are . It's a good if unremarkable film , hampered somewhat by an obligatory and unnecessary love story that merely serves to slow things down .
573397	4532636	456396	7.0	Depressing Story Left Me Wanting More	Meet Sonia and Bruno , brand-new and very young parents to baby Jimmy , who have nowhere to live and no way to provide for their newborn son . Bruno is a petty thief , who uses the money he illegally makes to buy jackets and rent convertibles rather than supplying his wife and son with food and clothing . Sonia is basking in the glow of motherhood , and wanders through her days happily and naively assuming that everything will be fine . Until Bruno sells their baby through an illegal adoption ring . . . . The biggest surprise to me in watching this film is that it's not really about the baby at all . The effect Bruno's sale of Jimmy has on Sonia is so drastic that he becomes panic-stricken and immediately gets Jimmy back . After that , the film sticks with Bruno , and we see him fall deeper and deeper into a hole he has created for himself . The child of the film's title is not Jimmy but Bruno , and Sonia as well . These are kids trying to raise a kid , and to watch them try to do so is painful , heartbreaking and depressing . I was completely distracted by the fact that the baby not once cries , despite being dragged around on buses , left in cars and abandoned sheds , passed around from stranger to stranger . I couldn't believe how unrealistic the filmmakers had treated this part of the film when they bring an almost documentary-like approach to everything else . But then the ending came along , and I realized that the absence of tears throughout the film was a dramatic device . For at the end , the tears come , but not from Jimmy . No , they come from Sonia and Bruno , who crumble into one another's arms and cry like babies out of the fear and desperation at the overwhelming responsibility of life . I thought " L'Enfant " was well done , but at the same time it left me cold . We're not given much reason to care about Bruno , so watching him make one stupid decision after another gets tiresome after a while . The film highlights a problem , but it's one we already know exists , and it doesn't do anything in the way of offering a solution , so I'm not entirely sure what I was supposed to take away from it .
574022	4532636	42832	7.0	Minor Work from a Cinema Great	" Panic in the Streets " is a pretty standard B-movie that is raised a notch above other standard B-movies by its direction . Elia Kazan could take just about any material and make it better than it would otherwise have been in the hands of many others , and this film is no exception . It's a high-concept film : a murdered man's body ends up at the New Orleans city morgue and an autopsy reveals that it was infected with bubonic plague . The race is on to find the man's murderer to stop an epidemic . You would think this would get fairly run-of-the-mill treatment , which it sort of does , but it's Kazan's version of run-of-the-mill , which means there are all sorts of little directorial touches that prevent the film's style from feeling anonymous . Kazan had a knack for atmosphere , and the New Orleans setting really comes alive , as it would a year later for his masterpiece " A Streetcar Named Desire . " Richard Widmark is the doctor from the health bureau whom no one will believe , and he gives a fine , tense performance . Jack Palance uses his unbelievably sharp cheekbones and jawline to good effect as Blackie , the murderer on the lam . Zero Mostel is assigned the thankless duty of playing Blackie's sap of a fall guy . And I really liked Paul Douglas in a droll performance as the New Orleans chief of police and Widmark's right-hand-man . The premise of this movie has become eerily relevant in today's climate , which actually makes it somewhat uncomfortable to watch . But it's actually got a surprising amount of humor in it too . Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes , who plays his wife , have a lot of witty banter that sounds like the way married people really talk . Credit once again goes to Kazan for creating a female character that feels like a full-bodied person and not simply a collection of " feminine " traits . Widmark and Douglas are funny together too , and there's a laugh-out-loud scene when Douglas is interrogating some Asian boat workers who have only the barest grasp of the English language . The obligatory chase and fight scene at the end does not feel at all staged , which is refreshing . The fist fight looks clunky and clumsy , which is how fist fights in real life are , not the nicely choreographed things we are used to seeing in Hollywood movies . The whole movie has a refreshing realism to it , so while it may not be especially profound or one that you remember for years , it will probably entertain you for a couple of hours at least and may strike you as a cut above other movies of its type .
573488	4532636	406158	7.0	A Genial Film Carried by Moore's Marvelous Performance	Julianne Moore is a wonderful actress . In " The Prize Winner of Defiance , Ohio , " she gets no big showy scenes , no moments where she acknowledges her own talent by ACTING . There are no breakdowns , crack ups , manias or histrionics . The movie goes down easy and , once the DVD player has been turned off , is just as easy to forget . But I woke up the morning after having watched this movie thinking about Julianne Moore ( and no , not in THAT way ) . I realized that this disarmingly unshowy performance had a powerful impact on me ; through an accumulation of small , quiet moments and carefully crafted acting choices , Moore creates a full-bodied , rich and entirely satisfying character out of material that threatens at every step to descend into irretrievable schmaltz . It's a small miracle of acting . Unfortunately , Woody Harrelson does not fare as well . His blustery , childish and pathetic father is believable only about 50 % of the time . The movie is almost ridiculously one sided , and it's only Moore's expert and disciplined handling of her role that prevents the mother from coming across as too good to be true . The material is gooey and sentimental , but it's surprisingly less sentimental than I feared it would be . And anyway , sentiment like this I can forgive , since I'm bound to be a slobbery sentimental mess about my own parents some day too .
574371	4532636	800308	7.0	Ed Harris Sticks to Tradition with This Modest Western	Pretty much the definition of a solid " B " effort . " Appaloosa " was clearly Ed Harris's baby , as he directed , co-produced , co-wrote , and starred in it , as well as sang the song that plays over the end credits ! Given that , I'd love to report that I thought the film was a masterpiece , but it's far from that . It's a competent , standard western , feet planted squarely within the conventions of the genre . Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen play Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch , the sheriff and deputy , respectively , of a wild west town , hired to protect its citizens from the deadly bullying of a band of outlaws , led by Randall Bragg ( a miscast Jeremy Irons , who can't quite successfully lose his British accent ) . Like many westerns , the principal theme of the film revolves around male solidarity ; Virgil and Everett are so good at what they do because each is closer to the other than either is to anyone else . That " anyone else " includes Allison French , played by Renee Zellweger , looking even more pinched than usual , a lone woman who arrives in the town and hooks up with Virgil . For a while after her arrival , the screenplay flirts around with a love triangle , but it wisely drops that idea and avoids the predictable . It instead stays focused on Virgil and Everett and their quest to bring Bragg to justice , even after he's become a wealthy businessman and won the town's admiration . My biggest problem with " Appaloosa " was its lack of a point of view . Everett begins the film with a voice over narration explaining how he came to know Virgil and hitch his saddle to him , and the film's climax circles back to focus on him again , but throughout the middle part of the film he's treated like a secondary character and I forgot that the film started with his point of view . Mortensen does give the film's best performance , however , followed closely by Harris . Harris's performance might have resonated more if the character of Virgil had been better written . I thought the screenplay was going in an interesting direction with him at one point , in a scene where he abuses his authority , and suggested that the film might examine the fine line that separates Virgil from being as bad as the villains from whom he's protecting the town , but nothing comes of it . And Zellweger's character exists for plot purposes only . I couldn't really make sense of Ally French at all . An admirable effort that continues the mini western revival Hollywood has been enjoying lately that began last year with " The Assassination of Jesse James " and " 3 : 10 to Yuma , " but " Appaloosa " isn't anywhere nearly as fascinating as the first film or as wildly entertaining as the second .
574089	4532636	110932	8.0	Redford's Fiendishly Entertaining Movie About Entertainment	Robert Redford reminded everyone what a good director he could be with this slick and supremely entertaining film about the quiz show scandals in the early days of television . The subject seems at first glance like rather feeble material for good drama - - after all , it all happened so long ago and it was just a silly T . V . game show we're talking about here . But Redford digs into something deeper , namely the power television ( or any medium , for that matter ) has over its audience and the responsibility of that audience to play an active role in processing the information that medium is feeding to it . With stellar performances from Ralph Fiennes , Rob Morrow , Paul Scofield and , yes , even John Turturro , an actor I generally resist .
573463	4532636	23590	8.0	Hard-Core Pre-Code Film Is a Shocker	This pre-Code melodrama is terse and blunt , and it also happens to be one of the most shocking of the pre-Code films I've seen . Ann Dvorak , Joan Blondell and Bette Davis play three friends who meet ten years after having attended school together . Dvorak is a society woman who's itching for something more exciting than the dutiful husband ( Warren William ) and young son she has , and falls in with a gang of druggies and kidnappers . Blondell is the take charge spitfire who decides to intervene and save Dvorak's son from her destructive behavior ; she happens also to fall for Dvorak's husband in the process . Dvorak gives a harrowing and blistering performance as a woman who is driven literally insane by drug use , and the film's most shocking content occurs in the scenes that show her wasting away in the drug den , ravaged by cocaine . Blondell is typically cute and sassy . The young Davis might as well not be in the film at all , and only exists so that the title can make sense . The whole thing rushes like a steamroller to a slam-bang climax that will have your jaw on the floor . Like many Warners films from this time period , that movie pretends to be a sobering moral sermon while it's really just an exploitative bit of sensationalism , but whatever its intentions , it's a firecracker of a movie . With an appearance by a very young Humphrey Bogart .
573545	4532636	299478	8.0	Revisiting " Scenes from a Marriage "	A sequel of sorts to his 1973 magnum opus " Scenes from a Marriage , " " Sarband " picks up in real time Ingmar Bergman's story of a fractured marriage and its aftermath . Marianne , beautifully played by Bergman's muse , Liv Ullmann , visits her ex-husband , Johan ( Erland Josephson ) , whom she hasn't seen in years , for reasons even she can't explain . She doesn't know what she hopes to get from the reunion , though the fact that Johan , twenty years older than Marianne and in his mid-80s , may not be long for this world likely has much to do with it . Marianne stumbles into the dysfunction plaguing Johan's " other " family , the son ( Henrik ) he had before marrying Marianne and his son's daughter ( Karin ) . Henrik's wife and Karin's mother , the enigmatic Anna , died two years ago , and Karin has become an inappropriate surrogate for her in Henrik's life ( just how inappropriate is never made completely clear , but an abruptly ended French kiss between father and daughter shockingly suggests that their relationship has crossed more than just emotional boundaries ) . Henrik is smothering Karin , trying to prevent her from ever leaving him ( she's a cellist , as is Henrik , and wants to attend a music conservatory ) and filling her mind with guilt at the thought of doing so . Johan dotes on Karin , also making her a surrogate for Anna , whom Johan obviously loved with more than the type of love traditionally reserved for a daughter-in-law . He also uses Karin against Henrik , who he despises with a vitriolic aggression , and who is despised back with no less passion by his son . This is the mess Marianne steps into , becoming a sort of warm mother figure to both Karin and Johan , and an enemy to Henrik . Welcome to Ingmar Bergman territory . However , it does please me to report that , serious as this movie is , it's actually one of the most heart-warming films I've ever seen Bergman do . For all the time devoted to the supporting characters , the movie is really about Marianne . She's the one who goes on her quest seeking some sense of peace , and she gets it . She's hurt that she couldn't fulfill the role in Johan's life that Anna apparently did , and the fact that he adores his granddaughter from Anna while ignoring the two daughters he has with Marianne strikes a bitter chord with her . But Marianne ultimately leaves bitterness behind , and the film's final moments illustrate that she is moving on with the life she has rather than continuing to lament the life she lost . The skill with which Bergman develops the relationship between Marianne and Johan over the course of his two films is astounding . Ullmann and Josephson are so expert in their roles , and they have so much chemistry together , that you're fooled into thinking you really are watching two people who have the history their characters have in the films . Josephson plays Johan as a monster , but for all that you still see what it was about him that Marianne loved , and what she can't let go of , no matter how poorly he treats her . He's different with her than he is with others ; he lets his guard down , admits vulnerability . In a touching scene in this movie , he appears at Marianne's door in the middle of the night , scared as a little boy , and crawls into bed with her . He strips down to nothing , as does she , but the sight of their nakedness , rather than suggesting anything erotic , suggests instead the nakedness of a mother with her newly born baby . And Ullmann gives a tour de force performance . In " Scenes from a Marriage , " we watched her Marianne go through stages of confusion , grief and anger over the unfair dissolution of her marriage . But the Marianne we get here is resigned ; she knows by now what she has the right to expect , and doesn't expect more than that . And finally , FINALLY , when she sees how riddled with contempt Johan has become , she begins to be able to distance herself from him , think of herself as having a life of her own away from him , and perhaps even understanding that breaking from him was the best thing that could have happened to their relationship . " Saraband " doesn't have the devastating quality of " Scenes from a Marriage . " It feels more rushed and less developed . It also feels strangely surreal , as if these people are acting on a stage ; Bergman makes almost no attempt to make his film feel cinematic , and these people seem to exist in a world of their own , making their actions and feelings seem of less consequence . But it's still an outstanding film , and if it's true that this is Bergman's last , it's a beautiful swan song .
574504	4532636	74486	8.0	David Lynch's Bizarre Nightmare of Fatherhood	This phantasmagorical David Lynch film is nearly suffocating in its ability to immerse its audience in a domestic nightmare . It's a fascinating film , but not one I can say I necessarily enjoyed watching . All of Lynch's fever dream movies are open to interpretation , so I can only say what I took from this film personally . To me it was entirely about the fear of responsibility and the potential stagnation that comes with domestic married life and fatherhood . The baby in this film is literally a creature from another planet ; it's threatening not because it's evil or menacing itself but rather because it has needs and wants that it has no clear way of communicating and which its father doesn't entirely comprehend . The film manages to capture in images and sounds the kind of abstract thoughts and fears that lead men into mid-life crises . It's a difficult film to summarize or even describe , other than to say that it lingers in the brain and is amazingly unsettling to watch .
573347	4532636	53172	8.0	The First ( and Best ) Doris Day Sex Comedy	With " Pillow Talk , " Doris Day established a mini-genre of her own that would last well into the 1960s , the wholesome sex comedy . These films offered healthy doses of man-and-woman lust but couched them in bubble gum colored sets and silly complicated sitcom plots that made them palatable to the suburban housewife audience . Still , Doris Day deserves kudos for creating a new kind of 50s heroine , one that looked like the dutiful cookie cutter housewife but had a mind of her own and a saucy tongue to go with it . Her strong-willed independence threatened the uber-masculine appeal of her leading men ( Rock Hudson , Cary Grant ) , but did it in such a comical , likable way that audiences loved her rather than hated her for it . " Pillow Talk " is funny and mindless , not a bad combination if you're in the mood for it .
574256	4532636	33532	8.0	The Devil Is No Match for an American Politician	This film could never work now , because Americans are far too cynical to accept a politician beating the Devil in a battle of morals . Now the politician would be in the Devil's hip pocket . " The Devil and Daniel Webster " is a creepy , effective little morality tale about a farmer who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for prosperity and the politician who ends up defending him and winning it back . What seemed startling in 1941 feels mostly creaky by today's standards , but there are still some fresh moments of film making in this one . William Dieterle was obviously open to experimentation when it comes to the use of cinematography and sound , and the movie has a striking visual look . The plot is mostly connect the dots , and there are no real surprises , but I don't know that one watches a morality tale for surprises in the first place . Walter Huston is extremely creepy as the Devil ( aka Mr . Scratch ) . He received a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his performance even though , based on sheer screen time , he really has more of a supporting role . But he's so effective when on screen that his presence dominates the film even when he's physically absent , which probably accounts for the lead nomination . Edward Arnold is pretty good too as Daniel Webster . Also standing out is Jane Darwell ( Ma Joad in " The Grapes of Wrath " ) as a hardened farm mother . Parts of this film have a wicked sense of humour , which I thoroughly enjoyed . The trial at the end ( with a literal jury of the damned ) , is especially amusing . On a sidenote , the film was successful in capturing the 1941 Academy Award for Best Dramatic Score . Don't expect to see any points made that haven't already been made a thousand times in a thousand other movies , but enjoy the originality of the film technique on display .
573774	4532636	66026	8.0	The Definition of Organized Insanity	Once that now famous and haunting opening theme song , " Suicide Is Painless , " has finished playing , " MASH " bursts on to the screen in a blaze of sound and movement . It's a typical Altman film , and that's a huge compliment . It may not seem like anything special now , because his style has been so influential on all manner of present-day filmmakers , but at the time , audiences had never seen a major studio film whose ordering principle was mass chaos . Altman films have forever spoiled for me just a tiny bit all other carefully framed , carefully constructed conventional films , because his movies feel so alive in a way that other films don't . " MASH " is gloriously crazy , with all of the actors talking over one another and no apparent thought given to the framing of scenes . Altman has said that he wants his audiences to have to work at his movies . You have to decide what you want to listen to and who you want to watch , because virtually every character in the frame at any given moment is doing or saying something that's no less important than what some other character is doing or saying . But don't be fooled . Altman may have claimed innocence in imposing any kind of directorial hand on his material , but his films are as craftily constructed as any other . " MASH " begins with a montage of wounded soldiers being delivered to the medical unit for treatment , and one of the last shots of the film shows a dead body wrapped in a bright white sheet being driven through the MASH unit while in the foreground a group of doctors play cards , pausing only momentarily to glance at the sight . The message is clear . This casual framing approach that in a sense brings the story back to where we started tells us that there is an organizing principle to the lunacy and madness , and that principle is death . " MASH " feels more like an adaptation of Joseph Heller's novel " Catch-22 " than the Mike Nichols film that was actually based on the book , which ironically came out the same year as " MASH . " And I have to say that , unlike many other films that lose their lustre after many years and many viewings , " MASH " gets funnier every time I see it . I think there are better Altman films , and more important ones , but few are are such damn fun .
574372	4532636	37988	8.0	A Little Slow , But Effectively Creepy	This screen adaptation of the Oscar Wilde novel has style and atmosphere to spare , but it's also a bit slow and ponderous . Hurd Hatfield is perfectly cast as Dorian Gray , an English dandy who's terrified of losing his youth and unwittingly enters into some sort of supernatural pact - - he will never change , while a portrait of him painted by an artist friend will show all the sins and evils that Dorian gives himself over to in his pursuit of selfish pleasure . Albert Lewin provides meticulous direction , using deep-focus compositions in a way that makes Dorian's environment as much a character in the film as any of the living people , and also using color in a couple of clever shock moments for effect . But if he succeeds in creating an air of enigma around the story , the price he pays is that the film moves along rather sluggishly at times . George Sanders appears as another dandy friend of Dorian who's chiefly responsible for encouraging Dorian to give up his morals and embark on a life of debauchery . He's thoroughly aggravating , which no doubt is what the character called for , but doesn't make him any less annoying to deal with . Angela Lansbury has a brief role as one of Dorian's conquests who he carelessly tosses aside . And Donna Reed looks lovely but struggles with an undeveloped role as the love of Dorian's life . I'm not sure how that relationship is dealt with in Wilde's novel , but in the film not nearly enough time is devoted to it and so it comes off as unconvincing . Combine the period Gothic trappings of " Gaslight " with the themes of material obsession in " Laura " and you'll have a good idea of what to expect with " The Picture of Dorian Gray . "
573698	4532636	104036	8.0	Is That a Flashlight in Your Pocket ? . . . .	" The Crying Game " was quite a sensation back in 1992 , and all anybody could talk about in connection with the movie was its big twist . I knew about the twist in advance of seeing the film , so I was able to concentrate on the rest of the story , and it's quite a good one . Neil Jordan crafted a slick little IRA thriller with a dusting of modern-day noir , and the film scores on both the levels of plot and character . Stephen Rea and Jaye Davidson received Oscar nominations for their performances ( whatever happened to either of them ? ) , while Forest Whitaker and Miranda Richardson ( who had quite a prolific year in 1992 ) deliver solid turns as well .
574112	4532636	311648	8.0	Took Me By Surprise	This film blew me out of the water . I was expecting an amiable , slight comedy , serving more than anything else as a launching pad for Katie Holmes's career into the Hollywood big time . But instead , this movie is a substantive and very moving story about a young girl who desperately wants to make a nice Thanksgiving dinner for a family from whom she feels somewhat estranged . It's extremely warm but extremely sad , and left me with a huge lump in my throat . Katie Holmes is winning and sweet as April , and whether or not you like Holmes , I bet you'll be rooting for her by the film's end . For one day , her whole world becomes about planning one successful dinner party , and her lack of skill forces her to fall back on the kindness of neighbors she's never taken the time to meet . Meanwhile , her family ( mother , father , brother and snotty sister ) are on their way into the city to April's apartment , whining and complaining about having to visit a crummy part of town and missing no opportunity to criticize April , while trying to ignore the white elephant in the room , the fact that their mom has cancer and may not live to see another holiday . Of course , the conversations they have with each other communicate heaps of back story and clue us in to the family dynamic , and we learn that April's biggest critic , her mom , also happens to be the most like her daughter . Patricia Clarkson has become one of my favorite actresses , and her Academy Award nomination for her performance as the mom in this film was richly deserved ( I think she should have won ) . She beautifully plays this role with just the right amount of sarcasm and wit to prevent the movie from ever getting bogged down in sentimentality . When she finally is reunited with April at the very end , what could have been an icky , maudlin ending instead knocked the wind out of me with its simplicity and honest emotion . " Pieces of April " just feels like one of those movies that is based on actual events in the life of its writer or director . It's full of tiny details of behavior that make the characters feel completely authentic , rather than creations . And there's a total understanding on everybody's part of the dynamics at play in a family that doesn't always get along and of that tendency of families facing some sort of crisis to latch on to one thing that's pretty mundane in order to avoid dealing with something else that is too big for the individual family members to deal with on its own .
574456	4532636	39973	8.0	Forgotten Thriller Is a Lot of Fun	A nifty little thriller that has lawyer Edmond O'Brien hired as bodyguard for business tycoon Vincent Price . Of course it doesn't take a detective to figure out that someone is setting someone else up , nor does it take a college diploma to figure out who those someones might be . Still , the cast ( which also includes Ella Raines and William Bendix ) is obviously enjoying themselves here , and if they're not going to take things too seriously , why should you ? It's best not to think too hard about the plot developments ( like why would a tycoon hire a lawyer to be his bodyguard in the first place ? ) and just enjoy the slick ride .
574379	4532636	381849	8.0	This Wild West Belongs to Christian Bale and Russell Crowe	I went into " 3 : 10 to Yuma " with fairly low expectations , given James Mangold's track record as a mediocre director and the fact that I'm not necessarily a fan of westerns . How pleasantly surprised I was , then , to find that this particular western is slick and supremely entertaining . " 3 : 10 to Yuma " has all the trappings of the traditional western - - outlaws , humble ranchers , gunslingers , salty old-timers , buxom saloon barmaids - - but Russell Crowe and Christian Bale , the outlaw and humble rancher , respectively , bring a contemporary sensibility to the material that feels integrated rather than incongruous . Bale's rancher , Dan Evans , is suffering from feelings of male inadequacy as a result of being on the brink of losing his farm to debt ( he's already lost a leg to the Civil War ) . For two hundred dollars , he joins a group of upright townies who are escorting Ben Wade , vicious bad guy ( Crowe ) , to the train that will take him to Yuma prison . But Wade's loyal band , led by Charlie Price ( Ben Foster as the film's one weak link , giving a grating performance ) , won't let Wade go without a fight . Through clever writing and wonderful performances by Bale and Crowe , the two men almost become allies in making sure Wade gets to the train on time . Wade is so impressed with Evans ' integrity , even though he doesn't understand it , that he almost wants to see Evans succeed , even if that means he himself goes to jail . It's really a fascinating relationship , and it's that element of the film that makes it more than just a standard genre exercise . The last quarter of the film is a nailbiter ; Mangold falls back on that old reliable convention that westerns practically invented , the real time show down , with clocks placed here and there keeping time for the audience , and he does it well . The film belongs to Bale and Crowe , but there's strong acting throughout by the rest of the cast , notably Gretchen Mol in a few brief scenes as Evans ' wife and Peter Fonda as the requisite crusty old-timer .
574449	4532636	42276	8.0	Charming and Sweet	In Oscar lore , Judy Holliday is known as the actress who stole the Academy Award , undeservedly , one might add , right out from under either Bette Davis's ( " All About Eve " ) or Gloria Swanson's ( Sunset Boulevard " ) nose ( depending on which report you hear ) . Well , there's no doubt that Holliday's win was an unjust upset , but that should only upset you if you don't consider the entire history of the Academy Awards to be one long , uninterrupted unjust upset . Let's not hold the fact that a dumbass awards group decided her's was the best female performance of the year against her . Given the roles Judy Holliday would become known for playing , Billie Dawn certainly doesn't appear to be much of a stretch for her , but there's no denying that she's captivatingly charming in this lightweight George Cukor comedy . Holliday plays a ding-bat blonde numbskull gangster moll who , tired of her boyfriend's ( Broderick Crawford , made a star a year earlier by " All the King's Men " ) constant dismissal of her as just a dumb broad , sets out on an odyssey of self improvement . To help her in her goal , she enlists intellectual and booky William Holden ( we know he's intellectual because he wears glasses ) , who just happens to be drop-dead gorgeous as well ( this is Hollywood , folks ) . This is a sweet movie . I've got a soft spot for any story in which someone identifies his / her own limitations and sets out to improve them against the odds . There's a real excitement in seeing Holliday's character gradually begin to understand the satisfaction a good book can provide or become for the first time in her life legitimately engaged in a serious discussion and have opinions of her own . Holliday and Holden have sizzling chemistry , and even if Holliday isn't delivering Shakespeare , she's still awfully cute to watch . Melanie Griffith did a remake of this movie that I've never seen and never want to - - I don't believe for a minute that it can be anything but worse than Cukor's version . Despite Hollywood's tired attempts to force remakes down our throats , send the studio suits a message and stick with the originals - - they're always better .
573369	4532636	381061	8.0	A Bloody Good Show , Mr . Craig	The charm of James Bond films have mostly eluded me over the course of my 31 years . In fact , I've only seen one other as far as I can recall ( " Octopussy " - - and by the way , how did that movie ever get released with THAT title ? ) and I remember virtually nothing about it . I don't think I'm missing much . From the isolated moments I've been able to catch on T . V . here and there , Bond movies look pretty awful - - not , mind you , awful in the tongue-and-cheek , isn't-this-fun kind of way , but awful in the I-wonder-what-else-is-on-T . V . - right-now kind of way . Well , Daniel Craig may make me a Bond convert , at least for the next few films . " Casino Royale " is a blast - - it's an action-packed adrenaline jolt of a movie , full of beautiful people and beautiful locales , and it's a testament to its ability to entertain that I didn't once look at my watch during its 144 minute running time . Daniel Craig looks like a bulldog , runs like the terminator , and has steely blue eyes that usually match the color of whatever body of water he happens to be standing in front of at the moment . The moment he appears on screen , you get the sense that he's out to quash once and for all all of the naysayers out there who assume that he'll make a lousy Bond . And boy does he . He could take on Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan at the same time with both hands tied behind his back . Sean Connery maybe would give him a run for his money , but I suspect Craig would still pummel him severely . As for his sex appeal , I'll leave that to the ladies to assess , but if my wife's reaction to Craig's entrance half way through the film in a tuxedo is any indication , he's not lacking in that department either . It's almost laughable how regressive these movies are . Women are treated as nothing more than objects to either seduce or save , and Bond usually refers to the lead female in this as nothing more than " the girl . " I bet feminists hate James Bond .
574237	4532636	52561	9.0	The Verdict Doesn't Matter in This Courtroom Thriller	Television shows like " CSI " exist today because books and films like " Anatomy of a Murder " existed first . " Murder " was somewhat different from courtroom thrillers that had come before it , because it focused almost exclusively on dissecting the forensic evidence ( much of it quite graphic and frank for its time ) that the two sides use to build their cases , and less on the attorney histrionics and impassioned speeches that comprise most movies set in courtrooms . The film casts that benevolent everyman James Stewart as an attorney charged with defending a man ( Ben Gazarra ) accused of murder , who in turn claims that the murder was an act brought about by temporary insanity over the rape of his wife ( a sultry Lee Remick ) . Stewart's benign presence no doubt helped audiences at the time to more easily navigate the rough waters of this film's language and mental images . I don't know that a major Hollywood film before this had addressed the subject of rape so candidly . It's no surprise that Otto Preminger , that most provocative of provocative directors , helmed this one . George C . Scott has a lot of fun with his role as the cocky , snarky prosecuting attorney . He brings a predatory , menacing edge to the film , an edge enhanced by stark black and white photography and a jazzy score . In the end , whether or not Stewart wins his case is beside the point ; in this film , the ride is more important than the destination .
573324	4532636	32551	9.0	Not the Book , But Beautiful in Its Own Right	It's difficult on a first viewing of " The Grapes of Wrath " not to be somewhat disappointed with it . So much of Steinbeck's beautiful novel is left out of the film , and it's hard to see his story and characters wedged into the " gee whizz " style of film-making so prevalent at the time . But once you get beyond a comparison of the movie to the book , you begin to realize that John Ford created a beautiful piece of work of his own , and the film inspires a great deal of admiration , and deserves credit for its gutsiness at tackling a story that wouldn't have gone down smoothly with film executives at the time . Of course the most controversial parts of the book are left out ( like its final image , for example ) , but Ford still managed to work around the constraints forced upon him to fashion a hard-biting film . Henry Fonda is perfect casting for Tom Joad - - never have his otherworldly eyes been used to greater effect . And Jane Darwell is pitch-perfect as Ma Joad - - she captures the tough-as-nails dignity that the character has in the novel . The whole movie is lit by expert cinematographer Gregg Toland , who uses shadow and reflection to cast a ghostly pall over everything . Indeed , much of what Ford wasn't able to include in the film as words he communicates instead through images , and isn't that what a good book-to-film adaptation should do ? One of those films that feels ahead of its time .
573514	4532636	765429	9.0	Ridley Scott Knocks One Out of the Park	Director Ridley Scott has surprised me : he's finally made a movie I liked . Since the last one was " Alien " back in 1979 , I'd pretty much given up on him . " American Gangster " is a kinetic , dazzlingly entertaining crime film . It features two strong performances from Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe , but this wasn't a movie that left me remembering the performances . Rather , it's the great writing and assured directing that left me most impressed . Washington plays Frank Lucas , a drug dealer in 1960s Harlem who applies the principal of the American dream and capitalism to his drug trade : make something better and sell it for less , and pretty soon your product will be the one to beat . Crowe plays perhaps the only honest cop in New York City , who's appointed the leader of a narcotics unit whose mission is to bring an end ( or at least curb ) New York's rampant drug market . All of this is based on a true story , but who knows how accurate it all is . And frankly , with a movie as entertaining as this , who cares ? The film only slows down toward the end , when Washington and Crowe finally meet , and the screenplay decides it must tidy things up in a " here's-the-moral-of-the-story " kind of way . The rest is energetic and highly accomplished . The film doesn't join the ranks of " The Godfather " as one of the best American films about organized crime , but I'm not sure it tries to , and that's one of its best qualities . A host of other actors appear in supporting roles , including Cuba Gooding , Jr . , Chiwetel Ejiofor , Ruby Dee ( memorable as Washington's mother ) , Ted Levine ( who I'll never be able to see as anyone other than Buffalo Bill from " The Silence of the Lambs " ) , Josh Brolin ( who has now officially appeared in every movie released this year ) and , chewing the scenery , Armand Assante doing his best Marlon Brando impersonation . Like him or not , there's no denying that Scott does know his way around a movie set , and with " American Gangster " he's given us one of the best and one of the most entertaining films of the year .
573544	4532636	70644	9.0	Bergman's Version of a Cage Match	After " Wild Strawberries , " this is perhaps my favorite Bergman movie , though be warned : it will take the wind out of you , especially if you watch the full five-hour version in a condensed period of time , as I did . Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson create perhaps too realistic a version of marriage in this emotionally bruising film . When Marianne ( Ullmann ) finds out that Johan ( Josephson ) has been cheating on her and has decided to leave her , the safe , secure world she has built around her crumbles . She plays Marianne as a wife blind to her own husband's unhappiness and embarrassed that she didn't see it coming , and her's is a convincing portrait of a woman whose partner has decided long before her that what they have isn't working . Josephson makes Johan into a contemptible ass , but he still manages to earn our sympathy . It's easy to dislike Johan but difficult to hate him , so we're in many respects thrust into the same emotional straight jacket as Marianne . The saddest thing about " Scenes from a Marriage " is how much affection and love there actually is between these two people , and how it's going to waste . When they get angry , they lash out to hurt one another with words and even with fists at one point . There are tears , laughs , reveries . It's obvious that there wouldn't be the need for all this if there wasn't so much ingrained affection between them , and it's tragic to see them become each other's enemy rather than each other's ally . For a very good if not quite as brilliant sequel to this film , see " Saraband , " which has Marianne visiting Johan for the first time in many years after each has established a life of his / her own without the other . It brings a peaceful sense of closure and in many ways stitches up the raw wound left by the first film .
574326	4532636	68361	9.0	A Salvador Dali Painting Come to Life	This playful and surrealist film from Luis Bunuel is a gem from 1970s foreign language cinema . A group of well-to-dos gather for a dinner that never quite seems to take place , since each time they sit down to dine , some sort of bizarre , dreamlike occurrence prevents them from doing so . The film is difficult to describe ; it's like a fever dream visualized - - or like stepping into a Salvador Dali painting . The charms of the middle class depicted here are discreet indeed , nearly to the point of being nonexistent . Bunuel's point , of course . . . .
573982	4532636	468489	9.0	A Remarkable Variation on the Teacher Saves Student Theme	Ryan Fleck's writing and directorial debut is sober and even somewhat glum , but it boasts a tremendous and committed performance from Ryan Gosling in the lead role ; an understated and sweet performance from the young actress Shareeka Epps in a supporting role ; and an intelligent , thoughtful , spare screenplay that avoids falling prey to easy sentiment . Gosling plays Dan Dunne , a young history teacher from a liberal family who himself has liberal ideas and a charismatic way with his students . They like him in a guarded way , despite the fact that he's white and part of the institution that most of them , black kids from an impoverished neighborhood , have been taught to distrust . Dan is filled with the kind of optimism that many of us had coming right out of college , when we cared passionately about our beliefs and believed we could make others care as much about them . However , Dan's promise as a teacher is severely limited by his addiction to crack , which consumes his personal life and turns his lectures into chaotic ramblings . One of his students , a quiet girl named Drey , finds Dan after school hours stoned in the girls ' locker room , and an unlikely bond forms between the pair . Something about witnessing this intensely private and human side to her teacher makes Drey able to trust him and open up to him more than she can to anyone else in her immediate circle , which includes a well-intentioned but distracted mom , a brother in prison , and a no-good drug dealer friend of the family , who wants to put Drey to work delivering to customers . Meanwhile , something about the encounter works the same effect on Dan . It's as if being caught in the act removes the burden of secrecy , and he can let his guard down when with Drey . The two begin looking forward to their casual encounters and conversations , and each fills a void in the other's life . This isn't at all creepy or inappropriate . Drey may have a harmless crush on Dan in the way that young students often do on their teachers . Dan , for his part , becomes protective of Drey , and tries to convince her to stay away from the drug scene even as the example he sets conveys the exact opposite . He tenaciously clings to the belief that one man can indeed make a change even as the indifference and hardships of his immediate world tell him otherwise . " Half Nelson " paints a grim and harrowing picture of drug addiction and loneliness , and much of it is painfully depressing . But there's a tremendous warmth working under the surface of Fleck's film which prevents it from feeling nihilistic . Dan and Drey are both good people , trying to make their way in a world that doesn't always reward them for simply being good . The conclusion of the film is only mildly uplifting . We have the feeling that Dan has weathered some sort of crisis and has made some realizations about himself and his addiction , but the movie ends before we see what he does with that insight . He may ultimately be o . k . , or he may not . What's more important is that Drey will be o . k . , and one of the things I liked most about " Half Nelson " was its suggestion that many times the most effective role models are those who show us who we DON'T want to be , rather than those who we want to emulate . Gosling proves himself to be a young actor to watch with his performance here . Not once does he step out of character , and he exhibits a tremendous screen presence . He's able to charm us as much as he is his students . Shareeka Epps has a sweet , warm quality to her . Most of the time she keeps her mouth set and rigid , and conveys the quality of someone who's determined to be disappointed in the world so that the world won't have a chance to disappoint her first . But every once in a while , a character will make her smile , and when she does , her face lights up the screen . This is a fine film and one that lingered in my head . Highly recommended .
573939	4532636	32143	9.0	Claws Out , Ladies	Lovers of glamorous bitch fests will have the time of their lives with this gem from 1939 . MGM's best female talent were assembled for this catty story about females good and bad , and all of the conniving , backstabbing , hissing and scratching that ensues whenever you have a group of ladies together at one time . Of course it's all exaggerated , and even fairly retrograde by today's standards , but I encourage everyone to muffle those feminist sensibilities for two hours and allow yourselves to have fun here . Norma Shearer plays the goody-goody heroine , Joan Crawford plays the deliciously malevolent villainess , and Rosalind Russell steals every scene she's in as a brassy society lady with far too much time on her hands . George Cukor was directing at the height of his talents , and keeps things snappy and smart . A treasure to relish from one of Hollywood's golden years .
573757	4532636	26029	9.0	Early Hitchcock Is One of His Best	" The 39 Steps " is the best book Graham Greene never wrote . This classic thriller from Alfred Hitchcock has Greene's stamp all over it , though the famed author had nothing to do with it . It's got spy rings , a man implicated in a murder he didn't commit , a feisty and reluctant girl Friday and wonderfully atmospheric English settings ranging from a rowdy London music hall to the barren , eerie countryside . Robert Donat plays the man on the run and Madeleine Carroll the young lady who first joins him against her will and then cozies up to him when she realizes he's playing straight with her . I had some trouble warming up to Donat at first , but his charming performance gradually worked on me . I had no trouble warming up to Carroll - - I was in love with her from the start , even if I did want to punch her character repeatedly for making things so difficult for our leading man . The entire middle section of the film , that finds Donat and Carroll handcuffed together , is sexy and racy , especially a scene in which Carroll removes her wet stockings while Donat's cuffed hand wavers suggestively about her knees . This is pure Hitchcock , creepy , exciting and funny all at the same time . It's not to be missed .
573738	4532636	88846	9.0	It's Monty Python Meets George Orwell and Aldous Huxley	An audacious film , and one that was just born to be a cult classic . I've only seen " Brazil " once , but once was enough to make me fall in love with it , and I'm sure it's the kind of movie that just gets better and better the more you see it . Jonathan Pryce plays the man trapped in a dystopian future that looks like something out of Monty Python by way of George Orwell . Visionary director Terry Gilliam creates a fantastic visual world , and a host of great actors appear in small roles - - Robert De Niro has an especially memorable scene as a repair man . And I give Gilliam tremendous credit for sticking to his guns and giving us a downbeat ending in the director's cut .
573792	4532636	107822	9.0	One of the Best Films of 1993	A lot of audiences didn't quite know what to make of " The Piano " upon its initial release , which I think is a testament to its originality . I really hadn't seen anything quite like this movie and was riveted on my first go around with it . Jane Campion wrote and directed this story about a mute woman arranged to marry a landowner ( Sam Neill ) in 19th Century New Zealand . She has two loves : her young daughter ( played by Anna Paquin ) and her piano . She's drawn to a frightening but magnetic worker on the plantation ( Harvey Keitel ) and begins a torrid affair with him . Things come to a boil when she's found out by her husband . The film is intensely erotic without being gratuitous . The characters are fascinating , and the acting is uniformly stellar . Holly Hunter gives a brave and fierce performance . Not brave because she allows herself to be filmed nude frequently or because she recreates quite graphic sex acts ; but rather brave because she allows her character to be complicated and difficult and perhaps to some even unlikable . She never asks for our sympathy , but she does ask for our understanding . Neill and Keitel offer able support , and child actor Paquin amazes and delivers a quite un-childlike performance . Top the whole thing off with vivid cinematography and a lush score from Michael Nyman and you have one of the best films to emerge from 1993 .
573672	4532636	31742	9.0	Hits You Like a Gut Punch	This screen adaptation of the John Steinbeck classic novel is a harsh , fantastic film that took the wind out of me with its frank and brutal depiction of desperation and longing . Movies about the Depression that were actually made at the time of the Depression by people who knew of what they spoke by necessity feel so much more authentic than later movies that treat the Depression as a historical event . The men in this film are quite literally living day to day , and the comparison of men to dogs that serves as a running motif throughout the film feels like more than just a poetic device . Like dogs , these men were faced with the scary prospect of some day being of no more use , and there was no system in place to take care of them when that day came . Being shot like a dog put out of its misery by its owner really was preferable to the alternatives awaiting them . I was surprised about how candid this film was , and how bravely it tackled some of the thornier issues of Steinbeck's novel . The incident between Lenny and Mae is divested of some of its sexual overtones , but much is implied anyway . And a scene between Crooks , a black work hand , and some of the other workers , in which Crooks explains in blunt language what it means to be black , tackles race relations as honestly as many films today . Moments of this film are almost unbearably sad and poignant , but never in that over-sentimental way common to Hollywood films of this time period . Burgess Meredith is terrific in the role of George ; he expertly conveys - - without ever directly addressing it - - the bond he has with Lenny and the degree to which Lenny is as much George's savior as he is Lenny's . Charles Bickford is also excellent as a rough and world-weary worker . The cast's weak links are Betty Field - - hopelessly overplaying her bored sex kitten - - and Lon Chaney as Lenny , though both are very good in the pivotal scene that sets off the action of the film's finale . John Ford's adaptation of " The Grapes of Wrath " from the following year gets all of the attention today , and one hardly ever hears of " Of Mice and Men . " But much of what is great about Ford's film is also great about Lewis Milestone's , and he deserves credit for laying a fine blueprint for brining Steinbeck's beautiful and heartbreaking stories to the screen .
574370	4532636	42546	9.0	James Stewart and His Giant Bunny Are Absolutely Charming	James Stewart plays gentle soul Elwood P . Dowd in this charming , benevolent comedy spiced with hints of fantasy . Elwood is an eccentric man who consorts with an invisible 6 foot tall ( or 6 ' 3 " tall , to be exact ) rabbit named Harvey , much to the dismay of his sister and niece . They spend much of the film trying to have him committed to an institution so that he'll stop being an embarrassment to them , but their plans don't work , mostly because everyone with whom Elwood comes in contact is utterly beguiled by him . Elwood isn't " normal " like all of the other characters in the movie , meaning he's not uptight , cruel and worried about what others think of him . The movie asks its audience : would you rather be like Elwood or would you rather be " normal " ? Give me a giant invisible rabbit any day over the fussy characters with whom Elwood has to contend . It would be easy to dismiss Stewart's performance as too easy for him , as many critics did at the time of the film's release . But not just anyone could have played this character and made it work . Whether or not Stewart is acting the part well or is just being Jimmy Stewart in a well-matched role doesn't really matter , as the result is the same . He has a tremendous screen presence and carries the film , even though he's off-screen for much of it . " Harvey " is a sweet movie with a distinct strain of melancholia running through it . It's more about the way one wishes the world could be rather than the way it actually is .
573987	4532636	44789	9.0	One of My Favorites	This vaulted to the top of my list of favorite films noir the second it was over . This truly stylish and excellent little crime thriller stars John Payne as an ex-con who's framed for being involved with a bank robbery he had nothing to do with . Fueled by a sense of wronged justice , he tracks down the real culprits , who have met down in Mexico for the money exchange . The plot gets much more intricate than that , though , when it turns out that the boss of the operation , an ex-cop gone bad , is planning to double cross the other members of the team and collect the reward money for himself . And it gets more intricate when Payne falls for the boss's daughter , who has come down to visit him at his tropical getaway . Many of the usual noir touches are present in this film : the anti-hero who finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time ; the hard-boiled tough-guy patter ; the blurred lines between the law and the criminals . The film clips by at a tense pace , and it's an awful lot of fun .
573421	4532636	82096	9.0	We All Live on a Nazi Submarine	" Das Boot " is one of those movies you think there's no way you could actually enjoy , and then find yourself totally engrossed in . A three-and-a-half hour film in German set almost completely on a submarine would not seem to have the makings of a gripping film , but gripping this film certainly is . Wolfgang Petersen and his cameraman make tremendous use of their limited space , and this film is more visually dynamic than many films that have much more room to play with . The claustrophobia is intense , and the small details about life on a submarine endlessly fascinating . And it's a tremendously humanist film as well ; by the end , we don't really care that these men are fighting for the Nazi cause , we simply care about them as men .
574280	4532636	55852	9.0	Spending Time with Cleo	The Cleo in " Cleo from 5 to 7 " is a frivolous , spoiled singer living in Paris . The 5 to 7 refers to the two hours ( roughly ) of the day we spend with her as she awaits the results of a medical test that will tell her whether or not she has cancer . During that time , we watch her pout , sulk , buy a hat , and goof around with friends , but it's not until the film's final moments , when Cleo meets a total stranger , that she has anything resembling meaningful interaction with another human being . The most remarkable thing about " Cleo from 5 to 7 " is the performance of Corinne Marchand in the title role . Her Cleo is petulant and unlikable in the film's early moments , and she barely plays a part in her own story . She's not even so much afraid of dying as she is of losing her beauty . But over the course of the film , we see her gradually emerge from her pampered shell and flower into a three dimensional woman , capable of complicated thought and emotion . It's a minor miracle of acting . The film doesn't exactly have a happy ending , but it's not really a downer either . Cleo gets her diagnosis , but her reaction to it surprises us . Her final words in the film are about her feeling happy - - the way she delivers the line leads us to believe that this is a new sensation for her - - and at that point it's as if the diagnosis doesn't really matter anymore , either for her or us .
573405	4532636	34587	9.0	A Terrifically Spooky Drama	Val Lewton takes the Universal Pictures horror film idea and brings it to RKO , with tremendously improved results . " Cat People " is far superior to any of the horror offerings Universal dished up during the same time period . This superb chiller was helmed by Jacques Tourneur , director of what may have been the best film noir to emerge from the 1940s , " Out of the Past , " and he brings the same dreamy atmosphere to this film that he did to that classic . " Cat People " sounds ridiculous on paper - - it's like a female version of " The Wolf Man , " only set in the middle of New York City rather than rural England - - but it makes for a spooky movie . Simone Simon plays the Eastern European émigré who turns into a cat when her passions are aroused ; and nothing arouses them more than the jealousy she feels toward her husband's female co-worker , with whom he falls in love when his chilly wife won't perform her wifely duties . The plot is a feminist's nightmare - - the idea of a female " cat fight " being taken to literal extremes - - but it's not to be taken so seriously . Indeed , the best scenes in the film are exactly those that show Simon stalking her female nemesis , first down a foggy , shadowy pathway in the dead of night , then in an apartment swimming pool . Tourneur shoots everything beautifully ; he allows imaginative camera work to take the place of any sort of special effect , and hardly a frame of the movie goes by without an arresting image . Terrific stuff .
573323	4532636	32553	10.0	Chaplin's Plea for Peace	I know many people prefer Charlie Chaplin when he's silent , but I have to rank this as my favorite Chaplin film , sound and all . This is one of those movies chock full of one memorable scene after another : Chaplin's hapless soldier trying to load and fire a giant gun ; his goofy dictator cavorting with an inflatable beach ball designed to look like a globe of the world ; his gentle barber trying to give a member of the Gestapo a shave . I've heard that Chaplin was put on Hitler's death list as a result of this film ; I don't know whether that's true or not , but if he was I'm not surprised . I can't even imagine the guts it took to make a film that so obviously mocked such a scary historical figure . In a time when comedians mock our world leaders left and right , it's easy to forget that there were times ( and still places today ) when doing so could get you killed . Without Chaplin's impassioned plea that closes the movie , in which he steps out of character and warns his audience directly about the consequences of ignoring the gathering storm of Nazi Germany ( and fascism in general ) , " The Great Dictator " would be a marvelous comedy . With that plea , it becomes much more than merely a marvelous comedy ; it becomes an important and inspiring historical document , that happens also to be pretty damn funny too .
574506	4532636	41859	10.0	Robert Ryan Gives a Sensational Forgotten Performance in a Perfect Little Movie	A nearly perfect small B movie from director Robert Wise . Robert Ryan beautifully plays an aging boxer aching for a win , whose manager has so little faith in his abilities that he hasn't even told him he agreed to a fixed fight , so certain is he that Ryan will go down without having to lay down . Audrey Totter is Ryan's wife , tired of a life spent in flea-bag hotels in forgotten American towns , worrying that each fight will be Ryan's last . Ryan couldn't be better , and he's become one of my favorite noir actors . Totter is a little less well served by the script , but she's fine for what she's asked to do ( for a very different performance , see her as a deliciously evil femme fatale in " Tension " from 1950 ) . The movie takes place in real time , and it provides a fascinating , almost documentary like look behind the scenes of the boxing world . We see the boxers preparing for their bouts , both the young ones who are just starting out on their careers and the old ones who are clinging to theirs ' out of desperation . Ryan's boxing match is filmed in its entirety with fantastic editing adding to the excitement . The movie is completely lacking in sentimentality and has a marvelous authenticity to it that reminded me of some of the superb , gritty and naturalistic films that would become vogue in the 1970s . In many ways , " The Set-Up , " for all its modest budget and ambitions , feels way ahead of its time . A little known film , but one absolutely worth checking out .
573424	4532636	83866	10.0	I Will Always Watch This Movie As a 7-Year-Old Boy	There are some movies it's simply impossible to review with a critical eye , and " E . T . " is one of them . Come on - - I was seven when this movie came out . I belonged an E . T . fan club , for God's sake ! Let's just say that Steven Spielberg is in his element when working on movies like this , and it's only when he devotes himself to unadulterated fantasy and adventure that his penchant for over sentimentalization is bearable . I recently saw John Williams conduct music from several of his film scores at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra , and one of the pieces they performed was a medley set to images from the respective films , " E . T . " among them . I'm becoming such a sap as I get older that just the theme and some shots of little Drew Barrymore in pigtails almost made me cry .
573845	4532636	401383	10.0	A Phenomenal Movie About a Phenomenal Story	After hearing the numerous critical accolades heaped on this film , I thought there was no way it could live up to its hype . I was wrong . What a sensational , beautiful movie . Julian Schnabel , whose past efforts have left me cold , tells this amazing story with a nearly perfect directorial approach . It's about Jean-Dominique Bauby , former editor of Elle magazine , who suffered a rare kind of stroke that left him completely paralyzed from head to toe , but with his mental faculties completely intact . He learns to communicate by blinking an eyelid , and with the help of a translator , wrote the memoir on which this film is based one letter at a time . I haven't seen a movie this year that more perfectly matches visual style to subject matter . The first half an hour or so of the film is told strictly through Bauby's point of view - - the world appears as a series of blurry , fragmented images . This style nearly sent me out of my skin with claustrophobia , and while it can't come near to recreating what Bauby himself must have suffered , it's effective enough . But then the movie opens up as Bauby's world begins to expand , and the film becomes as much about the remarkable people around him who supported him in his recovery as it is about Bauby himself . Once Bauby's perceptions of the world become limited to what he can hear and what he can see through one eye , he realizes that he's lived his life somewhat deaf and dumb to the world around him , and so - - as the film implies - - do we all . But the film isn't preachy or over sentimental . It didn't really even have anything to say that I haven't heard before , yet it took such an original approach to the material that it all felt brand new . Mathieu Amalric delivers a marvelous performance as Bauby , and Max von Sydow will break your heart in two brief but devastating scenes as Bauby's dad .
573344	4532636	53198	10.0	One of the Best Non-English Films Ever Made	This marvelous film from one of my favorite foreign directors , Francois Truffaut , remains one of the best foreign-language films ever made . To many , the word " foreign " as it applies to movies means difficult , but " The 400 Blows " is actually a very simple tale simply told about a young man who turns to a life of petty crime for a lack of anything better to do with his life . It's a picaresque tale that is refreshingly free of a moral . We don't necessarily watch the film to see that the young boy eventually sees the error of his ways ; we watch simply to see what will happen to him , because we care about him . Truffaut gets his audience to feel for the boy exactly what the society in which he lives doesn't - - compassion - - and which , more than anything , would likely be most effective in convincing him to give up his delinquent ways . And there's that wonderful closing shot , the freeze on the boy's face , careless and free , qualities that the audience recognize as luxuries only the young can afford .
573920	4532636	80684	10.0	The Boy Who Loves " Star Wars "	A long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away . . . . . There was a boy who was only two years old when the original " Star Wars " film was released . He doesn't remember first seeing the movie , but he also doesn't remember life before it . He does remember the first " Star Wars " themed gift he got . . . a shoebox full of action figures from the original set . He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be . But years later , he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received : another box full of action figures , ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection . It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed , Anakin Skywalker , stopped being produced and carried in stores , and how this boy went for about ten years ( until he got into college ) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets ( don't ask . . . it's a Northern Illinois University thing ) . I can't review " Star Wars " as a movie . It represents absolutely everything good , fun and magical about my childhood . There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases , birthdays , summers and winters growing up . In the winter , my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth ( I was always Han Solo ) . My friends ' dad built them a kick-ass tree house , and that served as the Ewok village . They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it , and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home . I am unabashedly dorky when it comes to " Star Wars " and I think people either just understand that or they don't . I don't get the appeal of " Lord of the Rings " or " Star Trek " but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of George Lucas's films . I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time . Every time I put them in the DVD player , I feel like I'm eight years old again , when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of Anakin Skywalker . Grade ( for the entire trilogy ) :
574132	4532636	36244	10.0	A Fabulous Study of Mob Mentality	Before " 12 Angry Men " there was " The Ox-Bow Incident , " a bleaker and never less than fascinating exploration of the nature of mob violence . Unlike " 12 Angry Men , " this film has no clear-cut heroes . It takes place in a more primitive , wilder time and location , and the principal question at the crux of this movie's conflict is whether or not three suspected cattle thieves should be punished without due legal process . A small group is in favor of letting the frontier town sheriff handle the situation , while a much larger group smells only blood ( and in some cases are motivated by personal vengeance ) and convince themselves of the suspects ' guilt without listening to any of the evidence . It's quite a frightening movie in its own way , and it has a stark look at odds with the average studio film being churned out at the time ( 1943 ) . Henry Fonda is quite good , as usual , in the closest thing the movie has to a main character , but it seems pointless to single him out in what is obviously such an ensemble effort , and in a movie that only lasts a mere 75 minutes or so and has such a large cast , each actor manages to color his / her character with delightful details , sometimes with no more than a single line of dialogue or one reaction shot . " The Ox-Bow Incident " is a fantastic film . I don't think it's well-remembered now , but I'm thrilled to see it on DVD and hope that it will be rediscovered .
574209	4532636	46187	10.0	A Crown Jewel of 1950s Cinema	Samuel Fuller brings his customary playful and stylish direction to this seedy , pulpy story and manages to create one of the undiscovered gems of 1950s cinema . Richard Widmark plays a petty thief tough guy ( a role he perfected over the course of many movies ) , who snatches a young lady's ( Jean Peters ) wallet on a New York subway and with it a piece of much-wanted microfilm . This is 1953 , so of course the microfilm is property of Commie spies who will stop at nothing to get it back . When the girl shows up at Widmark's waterfront shack , sent by an abusive boyfriend to reclaim the film , Widmark senses the opportunity to shake her and her " comrades " down for big money . The plot thickens , people start dying , and Widmark and Peters fall in love . Fuller handles the love story clumsily , but more from a sense of indifference than bad writing or direction . It's as if he included a love story under duress , and so made it intentionally unbelievable , as love stories so frequently were and still are in Hollywood films . Peters gives a remarkable performance as a tough New Yawk cookie , part gangster moll and part damsel in distress . When violence occurs against her , we genuinely care about her well being , and it's typical of Fuller's renegade , ahead-of-his-time style that a happy ending is not necessarily a foregone conclusion . But the ultimate success of " Pickup on South Street " rests squarely on the world-weary shoulders of Thelma Ritter , who plays Moe , a feisty lady who makes money any way she can , whether that be selling neckties or acting as a police informant . Ritter gives the performance of her career ; in a breathtaking monologue , she conveys without ever directly addressing it the entire sad trajectory of her character's life , and the hopelessness she feels waking up every morning to a world of struggle , crime and hardship . It's as if every character Ritter ever played converges for one brief instant to give vent to all of the emotions they weren't given a chance to vent in those other movies . The scene is the highlight of Fuller's film , and a highlight of 50s cinema , period .
573470	4532636	365737	10.0	The Price We Pay	" Syriana " is a blistering , powerful film about the degree to which governments and corporate conglomerates place the ambition to control the world's oil supply above the well being of their citizens and employees . In this game , there are only bad guys , and what separates the villains from the protagonists is not a question of who's good and who's bad , but rather how bad each is willing to be . So maybe " Syriana " doesn't tell us anything new . But that doesn't mean its points aren't worth making again and again . And though it is complicated , and I'm not going to pretend I followed every detail of its intricate plot , it's not that hard to follow . Stephen Gaghan is a good writer , and he provides a nice summary of the film's action in its final moments . What emerges from this tangled puzzle is a web of corruption and self-interest , all fueled by the need for oil . In one plot thread , the men behind two soon-to-merge oil companies will stop at nothing to make the merger go through , since the new company will be one of the most powerful in the world . In another thread , the law firm representing the company proves that it's eager to cash in on the company's new economic success . Meanwhile , a power struggle between the two sons of an aging king in an unspecified Middle Eastern country ( though Saudi Arabia is obviously suggested ) has attracted the attention of the American government , operating through the CIA . America ( read American business ) has a vested interest in which of the king's sons succeeds him to the throne : It doesn't want the reform-minded eldest son , whose priorities will be building a country to benefit his own people ; it wants instead the younger son , who will continue to relegate his country to a cosy spot in America's hip pocket and take its orders directly from the president of the USA . And in the film's most chilling plot strand , we see how the struggle for oil feeds the radical Islam movement in the Middle East , providing young men with a feeling of brotherhood and righteousness in the face of a region they feel has turned its back on them in favor of big business and Western corruption . " Syriana " is tense , fast and furious . Following it can admittedly be somewhat exhausting , but if you pay very close attention to the first hour or so , as each story is introduced and the relationships between characters become clear , the second half of the movie is easier to digest . I disagree with other comments here that the characters aren't developed or that the acting is unimpressive . On the contrary , I think all of the actors create extremely nuanced , compelling characters , a challenging task given the fact that none of them are allowed more than a minute or so at a time to feed us information about themselves . A movie like this could easily fall prey to filling itself with a bunch of stock villains , all cocked eyebrows and facial mannerisms rather than full-bodied characterizations , and the fact that it avoids this is a tribute to both Gaghan and the cast . And hats off to the editor on this movie , who had perhaps the most daunting task of the year . 2005 has been full of terse , important films , fresh in their immediacy . There have been a small number of sensational , tough , thought-provoking films instead of a larger batch of more mediocre ones , as has been the case recently . " Syriana " is one of the best movies of the year : it's angry , yet it's not hopeless . I hope Americans see this movie . At this time of year , when people are trampling each other in malls in order to be first in line for Christmas sales , I hope they remember that the vast wealth of America frequently comes at the sake of people all over the world who will never have a fraction of the comfort those in our country take for granted .
