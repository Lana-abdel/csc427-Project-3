573533	4532636	69995	1.0	Like Having Glass Ground Into Your Eyeballs	Heed the warning of this movie's title and don't look at it now . . . or ever . This atrocious psychological thriller is neither psychologically complex nor especially thrilling . Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland play parents mourning the accidental death of their daughter , wandering around Venice while Sutherland is engaged in the renovation of an old cathedral . They run into a blind psychic and her sister , and their encounters with them bring Christie some solace about her daughter , but send Sutherland into a paranoid spiral which culminates in him following who he thinks is his dead daughter into the bell tower of a church and then . . . . . well , much hype has been built around the " shocking " ending to this movie , but let's just see if you give a damn about what happens by the time you get to it . My description of the plot makes it sound like it makes much more sense than it does when you're actually watching the film , because I've left out all of the utterly gratuitous and boring scenes that bring nothing to the party . Director Nicholas Roeg never met a trendy 1970s film trick that he didn't like , and so this movie is full of zooms , both in and out , jarring camera work and harsh , ear-splitting sound effects . I guess he's trying for a nerve-jangling effect , but it all seems like a lot of fuss and bother over nothing . This is an assemblage of disconnected scenes badly in need of a story . The most frightening thing about " Don't Look Now " is the extended love-making scene that assaults us with a fully nude Donald Sutherland . Now that's what will make you turn your eyes away in horror .
573440	4532636	785007	1.0	Eva Longoria Deserves the Flames of Hell	Much of " Over Her Dead Body " is so painfully unfunny that I was actually squirming in my seat out of embarrassment for the actors . Eva Longoria proves that she can't carry a film in this terrible romantic comedy , and further , that she doesn't really even have any comedic timing . She's grating and annoying as a ghost who returns to earth to keep a cooky psychic from dating her widower fiancé . The fiancé is played by Paul Rudd , drippy and charmless , while the psychic is played by Lake Bell , bringing the movie whatever anemic energy it has . I felt most sorry for Bell , as she appears to have some comic abilities and was working overtime in an effort to make the material work . Unfortunately , she is up against the insurmountable task of making any movie that features Jason Biggs tolerable , and she is dragged down with the rest of the cast like Leo DiCaprio at the end of " Titanic . " " Over Her Dead Body " actually pied me off , because of its laziness and utter lack of effort . I started to think of all the interesting projects that can't get funded because vast amounts of money are being funneled into bland crap like this . Seriously , does Hollywood think movies like this are good enough ? How stupid do they really think the movie-going public is ?
573317	4532636	414993	1.0	This Tree of Life Would Be Put to Better Use as Firewood	The only compliment I can pay " The Fountain " is that it's not ordinary . However , a little ordinariness might have helped this nearly unwatchable mess of a movie . Darren Aronofsky has made a cerebral , abstract film completely lacking any ounce of emotional significance . It comes across as one of those films that one person had too much control of . I can't believe for a second that there weren't people around Aronofsky who thought this movie was completely indigestible bilge ; unfortunately , none of them had the balls to tell him so . In " The Fountain , " Hugh Jackman plays some sort of doctor in the near future who is engaged in research to slow the aging process ( or something - - I was never entirely clear on this point ) . His wife ( Rachel Weisz , a long way away from " The Constant Gardener " ) is dying of a brain tumor , and curing her with these new but unperfected methods becomes an obsession of Jackman's . Meanwhile , she has written a book about a Spanish Conquistador during the inquisitions ( Jackman again ) who is sent by Queen Isabella ( Weisz again ) to find the famed tree of life . And as if that weren't enough , another version of Jackman ( this one bald , looking like a cross between Kevin Spacey and Dr . Evil ) floats around space in a big bubble with said tree of life ( which I think we are meant to think at this point is Weisz in her immortal form ) pausing occasionally to break off pieces of its bark to eat . All of this is treated with utmost seriousness and earnestness , and the results are ridiculous . The tone of the film is one of unrelenting gloom , with sombre music and muted line readings . Jackman is not nearly a capable enough actor to handle this role , though to be fair , I don't know that anyone else would be either . He mostly just looks sad and harried , and the only difference between any of the incarnations of him is in how much hair he has on his head and face ( there's the hairy Jackman , the moderately hairy Jackman and the shaved Jackman ) . Weisz mostly floats around in a stranded role as no more than something for Jackman to respond to . Arronofsky apparently was able to convince both of them to take this nonsense seriously , and the results are simply embarrassing at times . My wife and I laughed out loud more than once , and trust me , nothing in this movie was meant to be funny . But the climax , in which the Conquistador begins to gobble sap from the tree of life , only to have flowers erupt from all of his bodily orifices , is a tour de force of unintentional screen comedy . Ellen Burstyn inexplicably shows up in a small role as Jackman's boss . I have to believe she only agreed to do so as a favor to Aronofsky for giving her such a good role in his " Requiem for a Dream . "
573627	4532636	92646	1.0	Beyond Watchable	I've been having my own little Altman revival over the past months , watching all of his available movies in chronological order , both his masterpieces and his duds . I'm up to 1987 , and I think I may have finally found it - - that elusive thing known as Robert Altman's absolutely worst film . If you know about Altman , you know that all of his movies were an experiment to a greater or lesser extent and that some of them misfired dismally . In re-watching them with a fresh eye , I've found that none ( not even some really bad ones , like " A Wedding " , " Quintet " , or " Popeye " ) misfired quite as egregiously as " Beyond Therapy " . A farcical romp lampooning modern-day ( for the time ) romance , sexual preferences , neurotics and the analysts who are crazier than they are , " Beyond Therapy " has nothing to recommend it . The two leads , Jeff Goldblum and Julie Hagerty , make their characters instantly unlikable and never recover . Tom Conti and Glenda Jackson are probably the best members of the cast , as two whacked out therapists , but the parts they're given to play feel random and arbitrary . Christopher Guest basically plays the petulant gay man he would reprise so classically ten years later in " Waiting for Guffman " . I don't know how Christopher Durang's stage play would read in a different context . It seems paper thin judging by this version , but knowing Altman , I have a feeling he dealt with the source material liberally , and who knows how much of Durang's original play remains . This film certainly has Altman's footprints all over it , and in this case that's not a good thing .
573785	4532636	83972	1.0	Adding 3-D Doesn't Help	If possible , the third installment in the hit hack-up derby is even worse than the first film , which is really saying something . The entire " Friday the 13th " series is like a ten-car pile-up for me : I know I should avert my eyes , but something compels me to stare . These movies are an insult to my intelligence , yet I keep coming back for more , mostly because I remember these from being a kid and so they have a nostalgic tug to them . At least this one is the most 80s of the series . . . it's like a slasher version of " Roller Boogie . " We get punk motorcycle gang members with puffy hair and chains . . . one of them looks suspiciously like Debbie Allen . We also get a groovy disco space-agey them playing over the opening credits , announcing that the series has officially accepted its place as pure camp . Jason dons his trademark hockey mask for the first time , and proceeds to do quickly away with another batch of teens , who for their pure lack of anything intelligent to do or say deserve to die , if for no other reason . The 3-D effects are a riot in this - - especially when you watch the film in 2-D and can realize just how far out of their way the film makers went to work 3-D into the film . Some of the effects were inventive : Jason shoots an arrow into a girl's eye , and the arrow comes right at the screen ; he squeezes a guy's head until his eye comes squiggling out toward the camera . But I have to assume that some of the other 3-D effects , like an overhead shot of exploding popcorn ( Oh my God , it's coming right at us ! ) were less than terrifying to experience . Jason outdoes himself with the body count this time around - - whole scenes exist for the purpose of introducing someone he can poke , prod or skewer . Is he working on commission ?
574077	4532636	85959	2.0	Downright Painful	Believe me , I did not want to dislike this movie , but ultimately I thought it was just awful . They Pythoners show none of the comedic dexterity on display in " The Holy Grail " or " Life of Brian , " and this movie put me sadly in mind of the worst " SNL " skits , when one lame joke is drawn agonizingly out over a 10 or 15 minute skit . " The Meaning of Life " is much edgier in subject matter than its predecessors , but so what ? Making something edgier does not inherently make it funnier . I have to believe the high rating this film received at IMDb is a tribute more to all of the love out there for Monty Python and not for this film in particular . A movie that may cause you to crack the barest of smiles once or twice , if it's lucky .
574128	4532636	329575	2.0	Use the DVD as a Coaster If You Want Your Full Money's Worth	Using your copy of " Seabiscuit " to set drinks on would be a more interesting use for it than actually playing the boring thing . Oh , what a safe , boring , dull movie this is . Gary Ross obviously went to the Ron Howard school of directing , where points are pounded home with a hammer and anvil and manipulated emotions are manufactured with assembly-line rapidity . This is the kind of movie where everyone delivers lines that sound like they should be on self-help bumper stickers ; homilies are handed out like parking tickets . And the movie doesn't end until each character gets to deliver at least one clunker , and most of them get to deliver many more . " Seabiscuit " isn't even really a bad movie - - it's an uninteresting movie , which is much worse . Even bad movies can be fascinating , but the filmmakers here aim so low at trying to please the lowest common denominator of viewer that they've put together a batch of pandering mush that has not one genuine emotion in it . Yuck . . .
574100	4532636	91738	4.0	Kathleen Turner Got Stuck in a Bad Movie	Did Francis Ford Coppola have a brain aneurysm some time after directing " Apocalypse Now " that made him absolutely incapable of making a good movie ? You have to wonder what the director of " The Godfather " and " The Conversation " was thinking when he made this flabby film . It gives Kathleen Turner a starring vehicle , playing a woman who travels back in time and gets to redo her adolescence knowing all of the things that life as an adult has taught her , and Turner , the trooper that she is , does what she can with it , but this movie couldn't be saved by anyone . It doesn't even have any style to it , and , given its director , one would expect that even if it had nothing else , it would have that .
574137	4532636	37884	4.0	Well Below Wilder's Usual Standard	Perhaps it's inevitable that a film that appeared so shocking and candid 60 years ago would seem so hopelessly out of touch with reality today , but I don't think the ultimate failure of this film can be blamed on the passing of time alone . Billy Wilder was a fantastic director , making movies that at the time were so much more intelligent and sophisticated than their peers , so I think he simply stumbled when making this overly-simplified message movie . To be sure , Wilder does bring some creative vision to this story of a raging alcoholic struggling through his addictive demons for one long weekend . He uses the cinematic equivalent of first-person narrative to get you into Ray Milland's mind , and tries to make the audience feel what it's like when alcohol is the focus of your world . Thus , at a performance of " La Traviata , " instead of filming the stage as it might appear to the audience watching the opera , Wilder cuts from shots of Milland's face to close-ups of the fake drinks the actors are holding as they perform . At other times , he even shoots scenes from the perspective of the alcohol , so when Milland tries to hide his booze from himself , we'll get shots of him storming around the room from the vantage point of the hidden bottles . But Milland gives a histrionic performance in the lead role , as cartoonish in its own way as Nicolas Cage's was in " Leaving Las Vegas , " playing another hopeless alcoholic , and he undermines any effort at seriousness on Wilder's part . The alcohol itself is nearly personified to the point of caricature ; I half expected to see a bottle of gin stand up and twirl its silent-film villain mustache while giving a dastardly laugh . And to top everything off , Milland delivers a ridiculous inspirational speech at the film's end , a call-to-arms for other silent alcoholics to emerge and begin overcoming their disease . After a whole movie in which alcoholism is depicted as a form of demonic possession , the ending makes it seem that the decision to quit drinking is as easy as changing from 2 % milk to skim . Still , this film should be commended for admitting that alcoholism IS a disease , and that it's not simply a lack of will power or self control that causes people to abuse . I can't think of a film before this one that really treated alcoholism seriously , or even addressed it at all . Think of all those 30s comedies ( " The Thin Man " comes to mind ) where hardly a scene goes by without the leading man holding a martini , or where the stumbling drunk is a stock character included for his comic potential . So " The Lost Weekend " is a film that I can't whole-heartedly pan , because I do feel that points should be rewarded for trying to use cinema as a communication device for addressing social concerns , but if you know an alcoholic , I doubt you'll be able to do anything but laugh at the silly version of alcoholism you'll see here . Compared to other Billy Wilder films , this one seems almost bad .
573740	4532636	88933	4.0	When the Walker Is a Rockin ' . . . . .	A gooey Ron Howard film about a bunch of old people who go swimming with alien pods and begin to regain their youth and vigor . The film is a who's who of famous veteran actors like Don Ameche , Wilford Brimley , Maureen Stapleton , Hume Cronyn , Jessica Tandy and Gwen Verdon , but it's all rather embarrassing and condescending - - awww , see , little old people still like to have sex too , isn't that cute ? ! ! A no-hands sex scene between Steve Guttenberg and one of the female aliens in a swimming pool freaked me out when I saw this as a kid . One of the numerous films in Ron Howard's canon that prove what a completely untalented director he is .
573796	4532636	35279	5.0	Somebody Sabotaged This Film's Screenplay	I don't hear " Saboteur " talked about much in conversations about Hitchcock's films , and I can see why . It feels more like a product of a second-tier director filming in the style of Alfred Hitchcock than a movie directed by the master himself . Robert Cummings is the wronged man in this story , accused of sabotaging a war munitions plant . He takes off to find the real culprits , running into Priscilla Lane along the way and reenacting some scenes that felt stolen directly from Hitchcock's own " The 39 Steps . " The only thing resembling a Hitchcockian set piece is the film's climax that finds our hero and his nemesis dangling from the torch of the Statue of Liberty . What relegates this film to the Hitchcock bargain bin and renders it forgettable is its ridiculously implausible screenplay . It feels sloppy and frequently makes no sense whatsoever . And the film ends so abruptly that you're not even sure what happens to the main character , but in a way that doesn't feel intentional . I've yet to see a Hitchcock film that isn't at least entertaining , and this one is that , but it's certainly not among his classics .
573746	4532636	89755	5.0	Classy and Boring	A tasteful and oh-so-dull film about writer Isak Dinesen and her love affair with a big-game hunter in the wilds of Africa . Sydney Pollack clearly wanted to win Oscars with this one , so that most vile of vile movie terms - - prestige - - is dripping from every frame . Well , he won his bookcase full of Oscars , but the result is a movie that looks better in stills than it does running across your television screen . Who knew that you could make something like syphilis look glossy ? Meryl Streep acts up a storm as usual , and practically leaves tire marks over poor Robert Redford , who simply can't keep up with her . Any movie with her in it is worth watching , but give me Pollack's less prestigious but far more entertaining " Tootsie " any day .
574103	4532636	91763	5.0	The First of Many Oliver Stone Onslaughts	So began the string of films with which Oliver Stone would assault our senses and earn him some of the most undeserved accolades in film history . " Platoon " is probably one of his stronger films , but it doesn't hold up well . At the time , it was notable for its authenticity in depicting the life of a Vietnam grunt , and I certainly want to be sensitive to anyone who served in Vietnam and has an appreciation for this movie because of it . But the movie itself is hopelessly overwrought and reeks of Stone's sledgehammer style of film-making . He can't allow emotions to speak for themselves , so he asks slow motion shots and thundering music to do the work instead . And there was enough material for a movie about Vietnam already without his having to concoct the ridiculous rivalry plot he cooks up for Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe to play out , both of them seemingly transplanted straight from the jungles of " Apocalypse Now " . Every time I hear that classical composition that plays over and over and over in this film I want to jab a fork into my eye .
573775	4532636	427969	5.0	A Rather Dull Disappointment	This slightly dreary film about the mysterious death of George Reeves , television's " Superman , " and its subsequent investigation feels like an opportunity missed to put a compelling and engaging story on the screen . The pacing is too sluggish and the ambitious screenplay too muddled for the film to ever come fully alive . It doesn't help that the central role , that of Louis Simo , the down-on-his-luck private investigator who consumes himself with Reeves ' murder in an attempt to win himself some needed publicity and fame , is woefully miscast . Adrien Brody is not at all right for the role of Simo . At one point in the film , one of his ex-colleagues makes a crack about there only being room in the world for one Ralph Meeker , an unfortunate line because it only draws attention to the fact that Brody has nowhere near the physical presence to pull off a tough-guy attitude like the one he's asked to pull off here . He's so young-looking and so slight in build that he comes across more like a scruffy high-schooler than he does a toughened and bitter detective . We see him become obsessed with the Reeves case at the expense of his personal life - - he's estranged from his wife ( I'm not sure if they are divorced or merely separated ) and his young son , and his girlfriend is cheating on him - - and he convinces himself and tries to convince everyone around him that Reeves was killed when the death was labeled by the LAPD as a suicide . Throughout the film , we see various versions of Reeves ' death played out in Simo's head as new evidence leads him down different paths toward different theories . But this investigation never picks up steam . The screenplay is torn between following Simo and his personal demons and Reeves and his . Much of the film is devoted to showing the rise and fall of Reeves ' career , and the movie can't ever decide whether it's more interested in him or Simo . In the end , I think we're supposed to feel that the two men shared something in common , and that Simo's personal downward spiral gives him a privileged peek into the mind of Reeves . He finally comes to see how the suicide angle could be true , and that , though all of the conspiracy theories he's shuffled around in his head make for better headlines , the real story might be something as simple as the hopelessness of one washed up actor . But the moment of this revelation is not clear and the connection between the two men isn't given enough focus or impact , so the audience is left holding two halves of a movie that don't completely fit together . Ben Affleck plays George Reeves and does a serviceable enough job . He gives probably the best performance in the film , thought it's not a film filled with great acting . Diane Lane plays Mrs . Mannix , wife of studio head Eddie Mannix ( Bob Hoskins ) and sugar momma to Reeves . Lane gives a mannered performance , and plays a rich pampered studio wife the way a college actress might play her . It doesn't help that the role as written flails all over the place . Hoskins makes little impression in his brief screen time . The thing I disliked most about " Hollywoodland " was the awkward blending of reality and fiction . Because certain moments take place exclusively in Simo's head , I wasn't always sure what was actually happening and what he was imagining , and in this case I didn't feel that the effect was intentional . The most egregious example of this comes during a scene when Reeves is performing for a group of children as Superman , and a small boy comes up to him with a real loaded gun and asks if he can shoot him . The way the scene is filmed and edited , it seems to be something Simo is either imagining or dreaming , but later on Reeves himself makes reference to the incident . How the situation played out , or how the little boy managed to get his hands on a loaded gun in the first place , is never explained . A disappointing film .
574380	4532636	76666	5.0	Look Mr . Kotter , I Can Dance !	It would be almost impossible to believe that John Travolta received an Academy Award nomination for this movie if the Academy didn't have a long history of nominating films and performances that left us scratching our heads at what they were thinking . Actually , Travolta's not bad in this movie ; if anything , he's absolutely the only reason to watch it now , because the movie itself just isn't very good . It's got groovy music , coiffed hair and 1970s disco atmosphere dripping from every frame , but it's primarily an excuse for a bunch of flashy dance numbers without the burden of stringing them together with anything resembling a real plot . It's hokey and harmless , but I can think of a thousand other movies off of the top of my head that would be more worth your time than this .
574491	4532636	102798	5.0	Men in Tights	Kevin Costner had worked hard the year before to cement his place in Hollywood as a serious director and actor , and nearly undid all of it with his embarrassing performance in this film . Though at the time I believe this film was a hit , so maybe the joke's on me . Costner can't hold on to his British accent for anything , and actually just gives up on it about 20 minutes into the movie , spending the rest of it talking like an American . Alan Rickman enlivens things through his performance as the villain and has the film's funniest scene , but the fact that that scene involves his attempts to rape Maid Marion should tell you something about the approach of director Kevin Reynolds . The whole thing is far more violent than it needs to be and way too long . " Robin Hood " should be a sprightly story , not this lead-footed thing .
573370	4532636	133152	5.0	Just Not the Same Without Charlton Heston in a Loincloth	Tim Burton takes a disappointingly literal approach to remaking the 1968 cult classic , and what he gives us is an undistinguished action film , not necessarily worse than any number of action films produced in a given year , but so much worse than it could have been given the source material and Burton's fierce imagination . Tim Roth is the standout among the simian characters - - he actually scared the crap out of me . The shock ending to the original was so well known that Burton knew he had to come up with something different , and to tell you the truth I can't even remember what it was ; that might give you an indication as to how effective it was . The opening credit sequence is this film's high point , and it all goes downhill from there .
573307	4532636	79261	5.0	This Age of Aquarius Came About Ten Years Too Late	Hollywood ignored the fact that the cult classic musical was virtually unfilmable ( not to mention the fact that by 1979 it was already outdated ) and made it into a movie anyway . The results are predictably mixed . It's not a disaster , but it's no classic . It suffers from having a strong narrative forced on it , whereas the stage version felt organic and like it was being made up as the actors went along . The music sounds pretty good , but the whole movie has the taint of the unnecessary . Treat Williams is pretty good , and Nell Carter shows up in a cameo and knocks one out of the park with the " White Boys / Black Boys " number . Milos Forman ( of all people ) directed .
574099	4532636	90555	5.0	Why Did We Like This Movie So Much the First Time Around ?	Paul Hogan became a minor star ( o . k . , a VERY minor star ) as a result of this well-received comedy about a man plucked out of the middle of the Australian outback and plunked down in New York City . Cue all of the requisite fish-out-of-water jokes . Viewing the film now , one is appalled at 1 . ) how not very good it is and 2 . ) how much smaller the world must have gotten since 1986 - - this movie makes Australia seem like a country from the far side of the moon . Hogan tried to capitalize on the success of this movie and threw his hat in the ring for a sequel . Not a good idea , mate .
573684	4532636	44391	5.0	Trash By Any Other Name . . . . . .	This glossy , trashy soap opera of a movie has won all sorts of accolades and an idolatrous fan base , but its appeal is lost on me . It's filmed in chilly black and white , giving it the patina of an art film , but if this were filmed in blazing Technicolor , it wouldn't be any more distinguished than a heap of other 50s sudsers , like " Peyton Place " or " The Best of Everything . " Vincente Minellis proved that he could do shadowy melodramas as well as colorful musicals , but his direction is still fairly anonymous . The pacing of the film itself , with its rigid flashback structure , is monotonous , and it's much too long . I get a kick out of Gloria Grahame in whatever she's in , so she was a welcome addition to the cast , but she's in the film for maybe ten minutes late into its running time , and I was too numbed by indifference by the time she appeared to regain interest . Dick Powell is the only other actor I really remember , mostly because his dry , cynical writer character was so far removed from the bouncy , googly-eyed boy-next-door roles he played in all of the Warners musicals .
573720	4532636	864761	6.0	Drag Out Your Period Garb for Another Uninspired Stroll Through History	Keira Knightley has become the go-to actress for portraying spunky feminist characters in period dramas . In her latest , she plays the Duchess of Devonshire , who challenges her husband's right to openly philander by doing some open philandering of her own . But of course she finds that double standards reign supreme , and we are shown the sacrifices a woman is willing to make in order to stay with her children . The movie is period designed to the hilt , and everything else about it ( writing , acting , directing ) is fine , but none of it is exceptional . Mostly , it just made me want to watch " Barry Lyndon " again . The movie doesn't distinguish itself from a hundred other period films you've seen that are just like it , and beyond the specifics of the Duchess's life ( which may be enough for some viewers ) , it doesn't tell us anything we don't already know . I take that back - - it did answer one question for me . If you're wondering whether or not all of those towering wigs surrounded by all of those burning candelabras ever resulted in a pyrotechnic mishap , they did . And punch comes in handy when you're trying to put out a fire .
573912	4532636	439815	6.0	You Might Think Twice Before Ordering the Escargot	Nathan Fillion's engaging screen personality was largely responsible for making something special out of the potentially run-of-the-mill sci-fi movie " Serenity , " and that same personality does something similar for this film , the latest in the flesh-eating zombie genre . In " Slither , " a meteor from outer space deposits a gooey egg out in the middle of some woods , which a very unlucky regular Joe comes across one dark night while cavorting with a female companion . A quick moving critter makes a home out of this regular Joe's body , and through him impregnates the female companion . She experiences perhaps the worst pregnancy ever caught on film until she pops like a giant helium balloon , unleashing a horde of speedy slugs that begin taking over the minds and bodies of a whole townful of regular folk . Nathan Fillion , playing the sheriff of this once-quiet village , along with a small batch of survivors , struggle to put an end to the infestation and restore order to the galaxy . " Slither " keeps its tongue firmly in cheek , so if it's not a great movie , it's at least a fun and playful one . It's not remotely scary , but it doesn't try to be . It's gross , but in a stylized way that allows you to enjoy the gross out parts , unlike the gore that characterizes the new breed of torture porn films that are so inexplicably popular . It's a rather lazy movie really , with characters getting killed off when the script doesn't know what else to do with them , and with too many dramatic conflicts being too quickly and easily resolved . But when I sat down to watch this , I was really in the mood for something I wouldn't have to think too much about but that wouldn't insult my intelligence , and " Slither " delivered in both respects .
573491	4532636	416236	6.0	Nothing New , But Enjoyable Enough	This film's not half bad , even if it does have a " been there , done that " quality to it in the wake of the recent glut of fantasy films based on children's books . Freddie Highmore is a good little actor , and he carries this movie about three children who unwittingly become involved in a battle to keep a book of magic secrets from falling into the hands of an evil goblin ( played by Nick Nolte , because who else would play an evil goblin ? ) The movie never gives us a great deal of reason to care about anything going on , and the special effects are numerous and unimpressive , but I was moderately engaged anyway . It probably helps that I saw it on a flight from Hawaii to Chicago and had little else to do , but still . . . .
573460	4532636	24008	6.0	Is That a Gearshift in Your Pocket or Are You Just Happy to See Me ?	In " Female , " Michael Curtiz's schizophrenic 1933 nothing , the lovely Ruth Chatterton plays the president of an auto manufacturing company who has put business and power above womanly advantages ( which in this film means she'd rather be independent than be barefoot and pregnant ) . She has her way with just about every even moderately good looking man in the joint , inviting them over to her house for " dinner " and to discuss business , only to halt the shop talk mid-way through and throw a pillow suggestively on the floor while the camera discreetly fades to black . All of this changes when she meets George Brent , an engineer hired by the company who is completely immune to Chatterton's dubious charms . Once she realizes that Brent isn't buying what she's selling , she revamps her product , opting instead to act like a typical woman , which means asking Brent's help in starting fires and speaking in a high-pitched sing-song . By the end , she's decided to chuck the business and hand it over to Brent so that she can be his dutiful wife . This film is absolutely absurd , even by 1933 standards , and you'll have to sit through about 40 feminist film seminars to wash the taste of it out of your mouth , but it's rather fun to see just how backwards it can possibly be . Chatterton is a likable actress and she's got a lot of spunk . The car manufacturing setting means that the screenwriter can create all sorts of double entrendes using car part lingo , and the whole thing's only about an hour long anyway , so it breezes right by .

It's not a satiric comedy , though it has satiric elements , but it's never compelling as drama either . Jack Nicholson is humorous enough as the dolt of a hit-man , and Kathleen Turner was at a career high when she made this film and just about runs the show . Creepy William Hickey gets a few scenes as don of a mafia family , and Anjelica Huston became the first actress ( and I think to date only actress ) to be directed to an Academy Award by a parent , but her role doesn't consist of much more than her walking around , decked out like a bird of prey . Maybe it's because Huston was reaching the end of his illustrious career ( this was one of the last movies he made ) , but the movie feels plodding and lifeless .
573955	4532636	420015	6.0	Dreary Ensemble Film with Some Terrific Performances	In a question and answer session with director Rodrigo Garcia and a handful of the film's cast members ( available as a special feature on the DVD release ) , Garcia says that the motivation behind " Nine Lives " was the idea of looking into people's windows and capturing a moment of their lives in real time , without formal beginning or end . If that is the case , tell me what street these people's houses sit on , and remind me never to live there . This relentlessly sombre film gives us nine vignettes , each focusing on a moment in the life of a woman . Characters from one segment will appear in another , a gimmick that ties into the film's theme of connectedness but that otherwise has become one big mighty cliché in this day of Tarantinos , PT Andersons and Innaritus ( who serves as producer on this film , by the way ) . The biggest flaw is that this gimmick remains just that - - it forces a structured narrative on a film that doesn't need one , but it doesn't bring any additional nuance to the film . For instance , in a segment featuring Lisa Gay Hamilton as a deeply disturbed woman who comes home to settle scores with her father , we find that the character of the father has already appeared in the film's first segment , as a prison warden , but the connection doesn't tell us anything about him , his daughter or their relationship . Hamilton appears as a nurse in a later segment in which a woman ( Kathy Baker ) is being prepped for a mastectomy , but again , there's no continuity of character - - we don't know how to relate this calm and sedate nurse to the frantic young woman we saw earlier , and Garcia offers no help - - Hamilton could be playing completely different characters . Worst of all , Garcia's vision of life is unnecessarily gloomy and sad . Each woman deals with her own private demon , whether it be lost love , fear of death , loss of a loved one , murderous rage , guilt , regret , bitterness . But the movie is seriously lacking any message of hope . According to Garcia , life is a struggle , but he never illuminates what makes the struggle worthwhile . In any movie like this , the selling point is the acting , and it's no surprise that the performances are what make this film most worth watching . Robin Wright Penn , Kathy Baker and Glenn Close , in particular , do smashing work , and Close's segment , which closes the film , may just take your breath away . Nice try , but not an unequivocal success .
574098	4532636	92005	6.0	Notable for Making Me Hate Kiefer Sutherland	Wow , I'm actually quite amazed at the high rating this film has at IMDb - - in the top 250 ? Really ? Based on a novella by Stephen King titled " The Body " ( hmmm , can't imagine why they changed the title for the movie ) , " Stand by Me " is one of those coming-of-age movies drenched in nostalgia for a more innocent time , set to period rock ' n roll tunes that makes for a better soundtrack than it does a movie . It's ably acted by a cast of young actors ( the late River Phoenix among them ) , and it's a solid effort overall , but it's not a movie that really spoke to me in any way or which I even really remember much all these years later . This movie did , however , trigger my repulsion for Kiefer Sutherland , which I nurture to this day .
574160	4532636	40178	6.0	A Fun Little Nothing	Tough-talking mug Lawrence Tierney is the hero of this quick and dirty cheapy from 1948 . He plays a detective who's kicked off the force for being a hot head , and gets a job moonlighting as the bodyguard for an elderly lady ( Elizabeth Risdon ) , matriarch and acting manager of a large and successful meat-packing company , whose life is being threatened for unknown reasons . Of course it's not long before we and Tierney realize that he's been set up to be the fall guy for a crooked plot to swindle the company away from the old lady , and he helps crack the case with the help of his girl Friday Priscilla Lane . " Bodyguard " is almost laughingly short and inconsequential , but it's an awful lot of fun . There's nothing especially striking about the writing or visual style , but yet it doesn't feel anonymous either . There are some clever set pieces to distinguish the film , most notably a scene that takes place in an optometrist's office and that uses some clever lighting and framing . And Tierney has a cute relationship with Lane , and it's refreshing to see a woman in a film like this take an active role in solving the crime rather than simply be someone the leading man has to rescue . Robert Altman ( credited as Robert B . Altman ) wrote the story for this film at the ripe old age of 25 . Far from a must see , but enjoyable if you can find it .
573686	4532636	44672	6.0	Not Quite a Train Wreck ( Though There's One in the Movie )	If you want to do a garish , ponderous epic , Cecil B . is your man , as he proves with this " Ten Commandments " - sized circus story . " The Greatest Show on Earth " represents just about everything bad about 1950s film-making , but it also happens to be one enjoyable howler of a movie . DeMille always seemed to know that his movies were destined for camp , and there's always that sense that he's laughing at his earnest spectacles right along with you . Give me " The Greatest Show on Earth " over " Ben-Hur , " or any other number of oh-so-serious Hollywood epics , any day . There was no excuse for DeMille to inflict Betty Hutton on audiences a mere 2 years after her migraine-inducing performance in " Annie Get Your Gun , " but she's about the worst you'll have to contend with in this movie . As usual , Charlton Heston's acting is so bad it's good and Cornel Wilde looks like a plastic action figure of himself . Gloria Grahame single-handedly infuses the picture with some much-needed va-va-voom , and she has more chemistry with the elephant she's paired with in one scene that any of the rest of the cast has with each other . James Stewart shows up as a homicidal doctor disguised as a clown ( I'm not kidding ) , and fills the role of the obligatory prestige actor that all such trashy ensemble films must have ( think Fred Astaire in " The Towering Inferno " or Helen Hayes in " Airport " ) . The film is ugly as all get-out ; the Technicolor looks terrible , and the costumes are tawdry . There's nothing to distinguish the entire production except for the entire cast's apparent commitment to the material and DeMille's belief that this kind of movie is worth caring about . He's such a capable , if not especially artistic director , that he almost succeeds in convincing you that it is . Plus , there's a really cool train wreck at the end .
573994	4532636	29284	6.0	The Truth Is This Grant / Dunne Vehicle Is No " Awful Truth "	This romantic screwball comedy tries to recapture the zany chemistry shared between Cary Grant and Irene Dunne in " The Awful Truth , " but the final product falls somewhat flat . Something's just missing this time around , and it's a shame , because the story has serious screwball potential . Dunne plays Grant's supposedly dead wife , who shows up alive just after Grant has remarried . The rest of the movie is about Grant promising to tell his new wife ( Gail Patrick ) about his old one and finding ways out of it , and then getting jealous when the man ( Randolph Scott ) who shared seven years with Dunne on a deserted island when they both were supposed to be dead reenters the picture and threatens to steal Dunne away . The premise is dynamite , but the humour feels somewhat strained and many of the jokes fall flat . It doesn't help that Grant's character is a bit of a weenie , and the new wife , who we're supposed to think is a bitch but whom the film never establishes as such , comes across as a victim , which makes Grant's and Dunne's antics feel more mean than funny . There is a memorable conclusion though that finds Dunne in bed and Grant dressed as Santa Claus .
574027	4532636	489281	6.0	Another Forgettable Entry in the Iraq War Movie Mill	Kimberly Peirce becomes one of the latest directors to try and only marginally succeed in making a compelling film about the Iraq conflict . Peirce takes on as her subject the military's stop-loss clause , essentially a back door draft by which the military can use fine print in recruits ' contracts to prevent them from getting out once their time is up . Peirce obviously feels strongly about the policy , but what should be a hard-hitting drama feels instead like a rather preachy after-school special . She coaxes a nice performance out of Ryan Phillipe , as the soldier who goes AWOL when his stop-loss clause is activated , but she doesn't fare as well with the rest of the cast . The film suffers from confusing editing , that doesn't always make it clear where characters are or how events are related to one another , and the writing at times is weak as well , with character motivations not coming across as clearly as they should . I don't know what it is about the Iraq conflict that makes it so hard for filmmakers to make good movies about it . Maybe it will have to be over for a while before anyone can begin to approach it with any success .
574497	4532636	346336	6.0	Only Reviewing First Half , Because I Have No Intention of Watching Part II	I'm sorry to be doing this , and I won't blame you if you disregard my review because of it , but I'm basing my comments only on the first half of this six-hour film . Expecting much from this acclaimed and obviously beloved made-for-Italian-television miniseries , I instead finished the first half absolutely mystified at what people are responding to . The movie follows the stories of two very different but very close brothers whose lives take quite different directions : at the end of part I , one was a doctor dedicating himself to psychiatric institutional reform while the other was a military police officer . The film absolutely races through its plot ; I'm not exaggerating when I say that if you leave the room for a minute without pausing the film you may come back to find that years have passed while you were gone . The storytelling is completely one-note ; all incidents and events are told with the same uniform tone , so that the drama has no peaks and valleys , and none of it is compelling . Sure , a lot happens in terms of story , but I wasn't remotely engaged in any of it or in these characters . I'm sending the second half back unwatched , because there are too many other movies out there I want to see to muster up the energy or time to watch three more hours of this . I will give " The Best of Youth " the benefit of the doubt that it views better in its original format , as installments on T . V . Maybe the story would seem like it was taking its time a bit more if it were coming at you across a longer period of time , and maybe the static and boring film-making would come across better if you were watching it as a T . V . movie and not as a feature film . But that still doesn't make me like it any better .
573763	4532636	78199	7.0	Good Vehicle for Burstyn and Alda	This two-person play is transferred to the screen without being able to escape its stage origins , but it offers a great opportunity to see two fine actors give two fine performances . Ellen Burstyn and Alan Alda play lovers who meet once a year at the same time and place for a weekend together . In between , they live their separate lives with their respective families , and they spend as much time catching each other up about the goings on in their individual worlds as they do fooling around during their yearly trysts . Burstyn and Alda are a joy to watch , and they handle the evolution of their characters well . The movie itself gets better as the two principals age - - the early scenes don't come off as well ( the worst segment is one in which Burstyn's simple housewife experiments with hippie-dom while Alda's uptight Republican struggles with the death of a son in Vietnam ) , but the later scenes are simply wonderful , full of a poignancy that resists sentimentality . And I love the theme song to this movie . My wife and I had it played at our wedding .
573995	4532636	33152	7.0	Psychedelic Trip Through the Arabian Nights	A colorful and downright trippy version of the Arabian nights tale about a street urchin who stumbles upon a magic lamp and is granted three wishes by an all-powerful genie . Actually , that's only part of the story as presented here , but it's the part of the film that provides the craziest and most spectacular special effects . The rest of the film concerns a king who seeks revenge on the evil sorcerer who steals his throne , in the process taking back his true love . This is a fun and engaging film , awfully cheesy but in a good way . Disney ransacked bits and pieces of it for their animated hit " Aladdin . "
573943	4532636	493459	7.0	Entertaining , But Not as Scathing as It Could Have Been	Kirby Dick's expose of the MPAA's ratings process only confirms the suspicion that motion picture ratings are virtually worthless , arbitrarily assigned by an elite panel who purport to have our country's children's best interests at heart , but who seem to think that an exposed breast is more harmful to them than seeing a gunshot to the head . It's absolutely infuriating that the country's churches have a seat on the ratings boards and a say in what content is or is not suitable for consumption . It's infuriating that an NC-17 rating exists at all ( the board is essentially usurping the judgement and decision-making abilities of parents ) , but doubly infuriating that it's used as a punishment to " encourage " filmmakers to alter their films so that they're more palatable for mainstream film goers . For a while I was kind of sad that home video and the Internet seems to be supplanting movie theatres as the preferred venue for watching films , but now I appreciate the democratizing effect of companies like Netflix and Blockbuster , who have made great filmmakers less reliant on corporate theatre chains to get their films distributed and seen . As a documentary , " This Film Is Not Yet Rated " is rather disorganized . Dick has good points to make , but their impact is blunted by tangents and off-topic tirades . Dick hires a private detective to track down the identities of the ratings board , and spends far too much of his 96 minutes following the details of that investigation . On the plus side , it's great to see directors and actors like Kimberly Peirce , Maria Bello and John Waters given a venue to vent their frustrations at the ratings practice . One of the main points Dick makes , and one I heartily agree with , is that the ratings board focuses far more energy on censoring sex in films than they do violence , a point that is unintentionally driven home by none other than the ratings board chairman herself towards the film's climax . Dick asks why his documentary received an NC-17 rating and she cites the sexual content that appears in some of the clips of films that have received NC-17 ratings sprinkled throughout the documentary . She seems to have no problem with some of the very violent content included in clips from some of those very same movies . What an idiot .
574418	4532636	54331	7.0	Good for a Hollywood Film ; Ehh for a Kubrick Film	Far , FAR better than " Ben-Hur , " which came out the year before , " Spartacus " still doesn't quite shake some of the same epic movie shackles that made William Wyler's film such a dismal bore . The point of this film is the sets and costumes ; the studios denied Kubrick the freedom to direct this movie in his instantly recognizable style , so while it's certainly solidly enough crafted and easy to sit through , it also feels anonymous , which wouldn't be so bad if you didn't know that someone as distinctly NON-anonymous as Kubrick helmed it . Can you imagine how much better " Spartacus " would have been if Kubrick had been able to direct it in the same style as that other piece of eye candy he created , " Barry Lyndon ? " Best not to think about such things that can never be .
573771	4532636	422720	7.0	A Piece of Candy	Those who want to learn the history of Marie Antoinette will not find it in Sofia Coppola's film . This movie raised more questions than it answered for me . I didn't know much of anything about this famous French monarch , other than that she was eventually beheaded ( which is not shown in the film ) and that Norma Shearer starred in a 1938 version of her story . I did a little bit of reading about Marie Antoinette after seeing Coppola's movie and decided that Coppola took much too frivolous an approach to the material . Many of the details about Marie Antoinette's life as first wife of the dauphin and then queen are present , but if you don't know her story before watching the film , they may slide right past you without notice , even some quite significant ones . Coppola doesn't provide an historical context in which to place the film's action ; therefore , we understand that certain things are important without understanding why . Why , for example , do the French end up hating her and Louis XVI so much ? What mistakes do they make as leaders that drives their country to such a desperate point ? The film ends with the king and queen fleeing the palace of Versailles - - there's a heck of a lot of story left to tell after that event , but it's not recorded here . I suspect Coppola was trying to put us in the queen's place - - she was a young , immature girl who was thrust into a position for which she was not emotionally ready . In the film , politics bore her , and she would much rather buy clothes and gossip . The job of running a country remains a vague nuisance pushed into the background . But this point of view approach backfires . We don't learn enough about what's at stake to ever feel especially concerned about Marie Antoinette or what happens to her , and the character itself isn't vivid . So why am I ultimately recommending the film ? Because it's lively , colorful and extremely well directed . It reminded me of Kubrick's " Barry Lyndon " : there's no substance to the movie , but it's so meticulously detailed in its production design , and it so faithfully recreates the rituals of 18th Century France , that it's absolutely fascinating on those terms alone . I enjoyed the anachronisms Coppola brings to the film : Kirsten Dunst , playing the title role , and Jason Schwartzman , as Louis XVI , speak in a slangy American dialect that doesn't even attempt to convince us that either of them is European ; in one scene , during a flashy montage showing Antoinette and her female cohorts enjoying the frivolity and excess for which she was so notorious , we get a glimpse of Converse sneakers discarded in the background ; and most notably , most of the soundtrack consists of contemporary pop tunes that comment on the action , and if they frequently take the burden of telling the story away from Coppola and her actors , they're also a lot of fun . Ultimately , " Marie Antoinette " resembles one of the many gooey , decadent candies that the queen consumes throughout the film - - completely lacking in substance , but lovely to look at and perfectly suited to satisfy a craving for something sweet .
574079	4532636	63374	7.0	Winning Pair in a Slight Neil Simon Effort	There's nothing really to dislike about " The Odd Couple , " and it's no surprise that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau make a hugely winning comedic team . But there's something so underdeveloped about Neil Simon's adaptation of his hit stage play as to make it seem more like a skit on a sketch comedy show than a full-bodied film . I have not seen the play , but have to assume that the screen version is fairly faithful , since Simon wrote it , so the defects cannot be blamed on a stage-to-screen adaptation . There are some interesting ideas in this story - - two recently divorced men who fall immediately into traditional married roles when they become roommates because neither knows any differently - - that Simon never fully fleshes out . Still , there are many worse ways to kill a couple of hours .
574483	4532636	418763	7.0	As Unfocused as the Gulf War Itself	" Jarhead " is like a " best-of " compilation film of other classic war movies . At different times , it reminded me of " Apocalypse Now , " " Full Metal Jacket , " and David O . Russell's " Three Kings , " among others . The problem is that it never achieves a style or point of view of its own . As a narrative , it's as unfocused and messy as the war it's about . However , it does manage to send you out of the theatre remembering specific images or moments , so in that way it's effective . Director Sam Mendes obviously wants us to feel the way Martin Sheen's character does in " Apocalypse " : adrift in a surreal nightmare . However , the difference between Coppola's film and this one , and what made the former successful and this one less so , is that even among the madness of Vietnam , the protagonist of " Apocalypse " had a distinct purpose . The movie was moving toward an eventual goal , which gave the chaos of the rest of the film some foundation . In " Jarhead , " it's all chaos and no apparent goal , which Mendes seems to be saying is the point of the Gulf War in general , but that doesn't necessarily make for a compelling film . It doesn't help that the characters in " Jarhead " remain virtual nonentities . They are the stock characters of any war film , easily described in one-word summaries : the " crazy " guy , the " sensitive " guy , the " jaded " guy . We really learn nothing about the central character played by Jake Gyllenhaal , and what we do learn about him is wildly inconsistent . The entire film feels vaguely critical of American military policy in the Middle East , but it never sharpens its critique into any point that has impact . This isn't the first time Mendes ( a British director ) has pointed his criticism at American values and left me wondering what point he's trying to make . David O . Russell does a much better job in " Three Kings , " because he introduces an opposing point of view to American actions . " Jarhead " is so insular , so focused on a bunch of kids that don't have any point of view , that we don't really have a point of view either . But as I said earlier , there are some very memorable sequences in this film , and even if they never really coalesce into anything of substance , taken on their own they have their own emotional impact . I particularly liked the sequence in which the soldiers are being interviewed by American media , but are coached beforehand on what they are and are not allowed to say . That's a much-needed reminder that we at home are likely never really getting the true story of what's going on in foreign lands . Other images , like a horse covered in oil , wandering through burning oil fields ; or a highway full of charred cars and bodies , everything still frozen in the exact position it was in at the moment of destruction , come close to equaling some of the images Coppola gave us in his film . America has dug itself into a hole in the Middle East , and who knows how or when we're going to be able to dig ourselves out of it . " Jarhead " wants to add yet one more dissenting voice to our country's actions , but it doesn't really have anything new to say . If its words were as good as its images , I would say it could be a terrific movie . As it is , it doesn't have the stuff to join the list of all-time great war films .
574398	4532636	85970	7.0	Keaton and Garr in a Battle of the Sexes	Aw , come on folks , why the low rating at IMDb ? OK , so " Mr . Mom " ain't exactly " Masterpiece Theatre , " but it's a very good , solid comedy that holds up surprisingly well today . Michael Keaton is one of those actors who I've always found to be intensely likable , no matter how good or bad the movie he happens to be in . The material in " Mr . Mom " is mostly played for laughs , but it's not without some serious truths about the roles men and women play ( or at least played ) and the challenges each faces when he / she enters the sphere traditionally reserved for the " other . " This film nails perfectly that depressing funk it's so easy to fall into when your day consists of household chores and daytime television . And conversely , it also understands the difficulty in balancing a challenging career with home responsibilities . Teri Garr is her usual adorable self as Keaton's wife , and Martin Mull is a little too good as her smarmy boss .
573846	4532636	120616	7.0	Take That , Boris Karloff	Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz save the world from the undead in this special effects extravaganza . Though reputedly based on the 1932 Universal Pictures classic of the same name that starred Boris Karloff , this movie shares almost nothing in common with the original except for the fact that it features , well , a mummy . Actually , this is much better than the original . It doesn't attempt to be remotely scary , opting instead for a goofy , wise-cracking tone reminiscent of the Indiana Jones movies . Of course , it's nowhere near as good as those - - it's not as light on its feet and it's burdened by a hefty load of not very impressive digital effects . But it's not a bad way to spend an evening .
573786	4532636	102511	7.0	A Surprisingly Touching Nightmare	After preparing myself for a completely inaccessible movie experience , I was surprised to find myself quite moved by a strange and sad film about the urges that drive one tortured soul . The movie makes some very interesting parallels between the urge to destructive behavior ( drink , for example ) and the urge to create art . In the surreal world of this film , these are two parts of the same instinct , and it's sad to see a man with so much creative potential simultaneously destroying himself . Director David Cronenberg gives us a bizarre , dream-like world that nevertheless has a distinct logic of its own . Peter Weller is terrific in the lead role ; this couldn't have been an easy performance to create , as he has to serve as an anchor for the audience and establish some sanity in an insane world . Judy Davis is also memorable as his love interest . It's not an easy film , but then what Cronenberg movie ever is ? It didn't leave me as cold as many of his other films , and I thought this one overcame the chilly cerebral intellectualism that ruined movies like " Dead Ringers " or " Crash " ( 1996 ) .
573593	4532636	1093824	7.0	Herzog Heads to the South Pole	Werner Herzog travels to Antarctica to film a colony of scientists going about their work with seals , penguins , volcanoes and the breathtaking sea life of this lesser known part of the world . This film is not the warning about global warming that you might expect , though the topic of global warming and man's future on this planet does come up . Nor do we , the audience , learn much about the scientists ' findings . Herzog traveled to this unpopulated part of the world where people drift when they want to get away from civilization , but the film seems more interested in these recluses than it does the environment to which they devote their time . This isn't that surprising , really . Herzog has always been interested in the human psyche and the motives that drive eccentrics to do the things they do . There's the sense in this film that Herzog has found himself among a batch of kindred spirits , and by learning what makes them tick may learn a little something about himself . The funniest part of the film is Herzog's interview of the taciturn penguin scientist . Watching the man's face as he tries to formulate answers to questions like " Can penguins be gay ? " and " Can penguins go insane ? " is worth the price of admission .
573952	4532636	49408	7.0	A Worthy If Not Ideal Screen Adaptation	Director Walter Lang does his best to ruin what may be Rodgers & Hammerstein's strongest stage musical , but he's no match for the stellar material . He directs with a stodgy , anonymous style - - why actually move your camera around a set when you can root it to the floor as if it's a potted plant ? With the exception of Yul Bryner and Deborah Kerr , he elicits performances from his cast that would be at home in a cheesy sword-and-sandal Biblical epic . And the film has that overblown , garish visual design too common to big films from this time period , that manages to look both cheap and expensive at the same time , as if all the sets are made out of brightly colored plexiglass . But , and this is a big " but , " this musical tells a beautiful story about cultural tolerance that remains intact in the film , and the movie offers the strong performances of Bryner and Kerr , both perfectly cast in their roles . " Carousel " may have given audiences the most sophisticated R & H score , but for me , the music in " The King and I " remains the most glorious . Too bad the adapted film score severely truncates its stage counterpart : many songs are missing entirely , and almost all of those left are shortened versions . Happily , the " Small House of Uncle Thomas " ballet sequence remains in the film and retains the original Jerome Robbins choreography as it appeared on stage . It may just be the most memorable musical number ever conceived for stage or screen . This film isn't the best possible screen adaptation of a nearly perfect stage show , but thanks to Bryner and Kerr , and of course R & H , it'll do .
573734	4532636	67309	7.0	Fonda and Sutherland Better Than the Movie They're In	Jane Fonda plays Bree Daniels , lonely New York City call girl , who becomes one of the key informants in the investigation surrounding the murder of one of her tricks . Detective John Klute , played by Donald Sutherland , who leads the investigation and gradually wins Bree's trust , ends up as her lover and protector when her life becomes endangered . " Klute " has a deeply unsettling quality in that hard to define way that characterizes so much of the best film-making from the 1970s . It's a portrait of urban isolation , a popular theme for the time , and it plays like a kind of female version of " Midnight Cowboy . " It's worth seeing for the performances of Fonda and Sutherland , who do terrific work as this unlikely romantic pair . But the screenplay leaves something to be desired . Fonda's performance is subtle , but the script too often is more obvious than it needs to be ( like a scene with Bree and her therapist where Bree tells her doctor that she continues to trick because she's hooked on the feeling of being in charge . . . . well , duh ! ) And the ending is especially disappointing , collapsing into a conventional pot-boiler climax that doesn't deliver on the fine character study that preceded it . Still , a worthwhile viewing experience and yet one more example of why the 70s are considered to be a golden age for challenging cinema .
574238	4532636	443543	7.0	A Thinking Man's Pot-Boiler	" The Illusionist " is a nifty but rather strange film . It's a mystery whose central mystery , once revealed , isn't all that mysterious , yet the film manages to build an exciting amount of suspense anyway . It's success , I think , lies in the fact that it builds a great deal of character development and character-driven subplots into the film , so that not everything hinges on how tricky you find the ending to be . As Paul Giamatti's police inspector character begins to connect the pieces of the puzzle in the film's climactic moments , it's more fun to watch his face responding to the trick than it is to see how the trick was pulled off in the first place . Edward Norton , as usual , does a fine job as master magician Eisenheim , who meets his long-lost childhood love ( Jessica Biel ) ten years after they were parted and told they could never be together , due to class differences . From there , it's up to Eisenheim to pull off his most elaborate illusion yet , and make them " disappear , " as his young love asks him to do early in the film . But where does reality end and illusion begin ? The film plays with that question in what is mostly pot-boiler fashion while giving it just enough intellectual trimmings ( talk about the soul , etc . ) to satisfy those who want a little meat with their thrillers . And Philip Glass provides a musical score that sounds for all the world like the one he composed for " The Hours , " though what worked so well for that movie feels less suited for the material here .

Cher , Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer play three smokin ' witches , and they gang up in tormenting Jack Nicholson . I saw this when I was fairly young , so there's no doubt a lot of adult humor that went right over my head . I do remember a scene in which the three witches make Nicholson start coughing up chicken feathers - - that kind of freaked out my young brain . Obviously , I'm not the person to go to for a thorough summary of this film , so you're forgiven if you ignore my comments entirely .
573739	4532636	88763	7.0	I'm Not a Big Fan of the Series , But This One Is Harmless Enough	The kind of comedy / adventure / sci-fi hybrid that the 1980s did very well , and which you just don't see anymore . " Back to the Future " solidified Michael J . Fox as a bona fide movie star , and featured a deliriously wacky Christopher Lloyd playing a scientist who invents a time travel machine . Robert Zemeckis keeps things light and playful - - he's one of many directors ( like Ron Howard , Steven Spielberg , etc . ) who started out making enjoyable romps until he felt the need to become " serious " and started making movie crap like " Forrest Gump . " I didn't fall in love with the " Back to the Future " series , but I see its appeal .
574481	4532636	30993	7.0	Capra Lite	So it's not like Frank Capra was known for making especially gritty films , but even at that this film is light stuff for him . It's entertaining enough but not very memorable . And the chunk of plot that was added for the movie version - - the lengthy courtroom scene - - attempts to open the movie up and give us some of that traditional Capra aw-shucksness , but it feels like exactly what it is - - tacked on material that was never meant to exist in the first place and only succeeds in making the film feel longer than it should be . It's got a good cast though . Jean Arthur is always adorable , and I'll watch a movie just because she's in it . Spring Byington plays the dotty family matriarch , a stock role in 30's movies , very well . The best performance probably comes from Lionel Barrymore : he seems beleaguered by a world that just won't let him and his family be , and your heart goes out to him . Not a bad way to spend a couple of hours , but you'd do better to watch " It Happened One Night " if you have a taste for screwball Capra .
573767	4532636	66206	8.0	Solidly Crafted and Smart WWII Drama	A fairly rousing WWII film that boasts a tremendous performance from George C . Scott in the title role . The movie begins famously with Scott addressing a troop of soldiers while standing in front of a massive American flag . It's a daring way to open a movie , and Scott makes it riveting . He's so good in the first few minutes that you might think the rest of the film loses some steam afterwards . It doesn't . Scott carries this film for its entire 170 minutes , and there's hardly a scene that he's not in . " Patton " isn't so much a biopic about one man as it is a document of one leader's decisions during wartime . It's smart and sensitive enough that it doesn't pander to easy sentiment or mindless patriotism , yet it's not exactly an indictment of war either . It seems to take the point of view that WWII was horrible but necessary , and that leaders like Patton were necessary if we were going to win - - people who seem custom made to exist during wartime and whom you can't imagine existing in any other context .
574220	4532636	37094	8.0	Davis and Rains Work Wonders Together	Bette Davis is given a role she can really sink her teeth into in this " women's picture " from 1944 . Davis plays Fanny Trellis , a spoiled young woman who marries the boring but very wealthy Job Skeffington ( Claude Rains ) as a way to save her wayward brother from bankruptcy . When the brother dies , she finds herself trapped in ( to her mind ) a loveless marriage and divorces . But when diphtheria leaves her physically ravaged , she sees how superficial her platoon of socialite friends and suitors really are , and it's old Job , who comes hobbling back from a Nazi concentration camp , who loves her for who she is and not what she looks like . My goodness , these 1940s melodramas could really cover a lot of territory . Some of them were duds and some of them were marvelous , and Davis starred in her fair share of both . " Mr . Skeffington " is definitely one of the latter . Davis was always so much better when she was playing a brat than when she was forced to do noble suffering , and she plays Fanny expertly and without an ounce of vanity . Rains is terrific too , and the real-life friendship that he and Davis shared off screen shows in the chemistry they have together on . Director Vincent Sherman keeps things moving briskly along , and it's not until the very end of the film that I began to feel its 145 minute running time .
574273	4532636	412019	8.0	Good Movie from an On Again / Off Again Director	I can't think of an actor better suited to play the expressionless chronic bachelor Don at the heart of Jim Jarmusch's newest movie than Bill Murray . His mournful hound-dog face , which hides any trace of what's going on inside the head on which it sits , stares blankly at the T . V . , at other people , sometimes at nothing , betrays itself with the slightest movement of the mouth or twitch of the eyes . It's a characterization Murray has so down pat that I'm tempted to think he's not really acting all that much , but he's so perfectly cast that it doesn't much matter whether he's acting or not . If you're not familiar with the movies of Jim Jarmusch , " Broken Flowers " is a nice introduction , as it's the most accessible Jarmusch film I've seen . I'm not a huge fan , but I liked this movie quite a lot . Don receives an anonymous letter one day from a past girlfriend , telling him he has a 19-year-old son who may come looking for him . Murray's friend , Winston ( played amusingly by the chameleon Jeffrey Wright ) , convinces him to track down a handful of women who could have possibly been the mother and resolve the mystery . Don agrees to it , seemingly not so much because he has a need to know but because he has nothing better to do . What follows is a series of scenes with each past girlfriend , during which their interactions with Don tell us heaps about their relationship back when they were dating . Some are affectionate , some are distant , one is downright scarily angry , but all are played beautifully by a quartet of actresses : Sharon Stone , Frances Conroy , Jessica Lange and Tilda Swinton . This is Jarmusch , so there aren't necessarily any tidy answers , and I don't think I give anything away by saying that the mystery is never solved . Life is messy , and it doesn't always happily resolve itself just because we want it to . I liked how subtle the film was ; Don doesn't make any huge ground-breaking discoveries about himself , but nevertheless you sense that he's a slightly different person after his journey than he was before it . You'll have to be patient , as Jarmusch tells his story very slowly , and nearly all of Don's interaction with others is ponderously awkward . But the movie slowly begins to fascinate , and you find yourself watching the faces of the women he visits ( and examining the visible details of their lives ) much in the same way that Don is himself , looking for the slightest hint that she might be the one who sent that fateful letter . A very fine film , poignant and sad in a rather obscure way , and one that stays in your mind for a while after seeing it .
574431	4532636	70290	8.0	A Well Acted , Sober Film About Unpleasant Responsibilities	Don't let the fact that the DVD cover makes this movie look like gay porn keep you from seeing it . Director Hal Ashby made a string of unfussy but very , very good films throughout the 1970s , and " The Last Detail " is one them . The story doesn't sound like much : two Navy officers are assigned to escort a third to the prison where he will be serving time . Along the way , the requisite male bonding ensues , and the older , jaded officer ( Jack Nicholson ) has a chance to reflect upon his own fortune and misfortune and be a sort of father figure , for better or worse , to his young and troubled charge ( played extremely well by Randy Quaid ) . Like all of Ashby's films , " The Last Detail " challenges things like duty and institutional authority , which made Ashby one of the most vocal of the anti-establishment directors from a volatile period of American history . But also like all of his films , it poses challenges in a low-key , non-confrontational way , without sacrificing its bite . Well done .
573799	4532636	405336	8.0	This Is How the World Ends . . . . . . Watching Reality T . V .	Another invigorating mindfck from Richard Kelly , the indie darling who made an auspicious debut with cult fave " Donnie Darko . " Like the previous film , I walked out of this one not necessarily understanding everything I had just seen , but feeling certain that I liked it , whatever it was . The film reminded me of books by Kurt Vonnegut and Joseph Heller , and at times of Thomas Pynchon's " Gravity's Rainbow . " It's earned itself a lot of hatred from audiences and critics alike , and it's admittedly not for everyone . But I appreciate Kelly's attempts to make films in a different way , eschewing some of the more conventional devices , like linear narrative , for more filmic ones , like dynamic imagery . If sometimes his movie feels like more of a mess than a movie , well that's the price you pay for being bold . At the heart of " Southland Tales " is a simple and what to me felt like a very personal story about two friends who served together in Iraq , and the fact that this story is nearly buried by a melange of subplots involving political machinations , activist groups , doomsday prophecies , philosophizing porn stars and schizophrenic actors seemed to me to come scarily close to the way our world looks right now when you turn on the television set . The film is full of second-tier actors doing very good work , and the movie is awfully funny , but it has a palpably emotional center , just like " Donnie Darko . " If it didn't have that , I think it would have just come across as glib . I couldn't make sense of all of it , but I felt like those involved in making it could , and that makes all the difference in the world between a good movie and a bad one .
574235	4532636	478134	8.0	A Tough-Minded Film About the Terrible Toll of the Iraq War	It will be interesting once the current wretched Iraq war is a distant memory to go back and watch the movies about the war that came out while it was raging on . " In the Valley of Elah " joins a list of other films about the Iraqi conflict ( or conflicts in the Middle East , in general ) that have tanked at the box office . Audiences have sent a clear message : We do not want to see movies that remind us about a terrible , depressing war that we can't do anything about . In " In the Valley of Elah , " Tommy Lee Jones plays Hank Deerfield , retired sergeant in the U . S . Army , who sets out on an investigation into the whereabouts of his son , Mike , when Mike returns from duty in Iraq and then goes missing . It's not long into the movie before the charred , dismembered remains of Hank's son are found in a field not far from the military base . Hank runs up against first the infuriating , squabbling bureaucracy of the local police force and the military police , who argue over jurisdiction , and then the indifference of both when it's determined that the crime is a military matter : the local police are glad to wash their hands of yet another homicide that promises to go unsolved , and the military wants to sweep the case under the rug as quickly as possible to avoid bad publicity . Hank's only nominal ally is Detective Emily Sanders ( Charlize Theron ) . Her doggedness in sticking to the investigation into the murder of Hank's son arises partially from her first chance to work on an important case , partially from her desire to do the right thing , and partially because she feels for Hank - - she has a son of her own . " In the Valley of Elah " is part police procedural drama , part character study , part angry diatribe against America's military institution . As the investigation progresses , Hank discovers some unpleasant truths about his son and some of the atrocities he committed while in Iraq . Likewise , his fellow troop members become implicated in his death , despite Hank's firm belief that a man's Army buddies would never do something like that to one another . The movie argues that these young men who are being sent to Iraq to " preserve our freedom " are absorbing a devastating psychological toll that no one wants to admit is there , not their families , not their friends , and certainly not the military itself . Jones , as Hank , is extraordinary , and Hank is fascinating . He's the kind of life-long military man we instantly recognize . He's quietly chauvinistic to his wife , a wonderful Susan Sarandon , and doesn't even tell her about the truths he's uncovering about their boy . When he stays in hotel rooms he remakes the bed to his satisfaction . He's a man so rigidly in control of himself that one of the only signs we see of the distress he's in is that he nicks himself shaving . One of the things I liked best about the film was its suggestion that people like Hank share as much responsibility as anyone for the toll foolish military leadership takes on the American public . He's doggedly macho , patriotic and unquestioning , a deadly combination . His wife blames him for the death of both of their sons ( an older son , also military , died ten years earlier in a helicopter crash ) , claiming that neither would have ever found acceptance as a man had they not gone into the military . He has an unshakable illusion of the military as a place of duty , discipline and honor . That nick he receives while shaving is like the first minuscule crack in the foundation of his belief in an institution to which he's pledged his life . It's heartbreaking to watch this man lose everything in his life that up to that point has given it meaning . I give co-writer / director Paul Haggis a lot of credit for making such a tough-minded movie while we're smack in the middle of a conflict that is taking people's children away from them . We've become especially sensitive of late to criticizing the military for fear that we won't be supporting the troops who comprise it . Haggis sensitively keeps the distinction intact , but he's not afraid to admit that there are soldiers coming back from the war and doing terrible things because they don't know how to readjust to civilian life . They're not coming back heroes , no matter how much we want to believe they are - - they're coming back hollowed out husks of who they used to be . Stylistically , the film is rather drab . Haggis takes a quiet and somber approach , as if the slightest loud noise or quick movement will detract from the elegiac tone he creates . Even the color palette is drab , all washed out blues and institutional grays . We know he's a director capable of style ; " Crash " was , if nothing else , stylish . But unlike that film , which was so schematic and over scripted that the actors couldn't breathe in their roles , " In the Valle of Elah " feels much more organic and understated , as if the characters are finding out truths about themselves as they go along rather than truths imposed on them from the heavy hand of the writer . The film teeters on the brink of sentimentality only a couple of times , but mostly it stays lean and tough . I really didn't expect to like this film as much as I did . It's haunting , thought provoking and one of the best films I've seen yet this year .
573682	4532636	45152	8.0	MGM Near the Top of Its Musical Game	The heaps of scholarly criticism heaped on " Singing ' in the Rain " have done it a disservice by giving it the ball and chain reputation of an IMPORTANT picture in cinema history . Let's not forget why " Singin ' in the Rain " was made , which was to provide a form of escapist entertainment , nor why it's still so loved now , which is because it's great fun and everything clicks . It's not homework , and it's not medicine . I don't even think it's the best movie musical ever made ( I liked MGM's " Seven Brides for Seven Brothers " more ) , and it's not one I feel compelled to go back to again and again . I'm not a huge fan of Gene Kelly , and think he's squirrelly when he's trying to be dashing , and Donald O'Connor's manic energy is just as likely to be exhausting as it is funny . But there's no improving on Jean Hagen's pitch-perfect performance as the ditzy villainess , and Debbie Reynolds shows how sweet and charming she was early in her career , before she became a broad . The songs and dances aren't especially well integrated into the film - - you can practically hear the gears grinding whenever the film transitions from its book to its musical portions . But the numbers are so wildly entertaining in and of themselves that you don't much care . The " Singin ' in the Rain " sequence does what far too few films do - - it transports you to a place where what's happening on the screen in front of you is the only thing that matters .
573808	4532636	89393	8.0	More Obscure , But One of My Favorites	This is one of the lower-tier teen comedies from the 1980s , and it's not as well known as movies like " Sixteen Candles , " " Pretty in Pink " or other films about high-school angst , but it's one of my favorites . Terry Griffith , aspiring journalist , gets an early taste of sexism when an article she writes for an internship contest is passed over for an obviously inferior article written by boys , so she poses as Ralph Macchio and signs up at a rival high school , hoping to submit her article there and get it accepted . Things get complicated , as such things do , when she falls for a nerd who's actually kind of cool when you get to know him , and she becomes the target for the high school bully , played by William Zabka , who created a cottage industry out of playing the blonde jock high school bully in teen movies from the 80s , and who coincidentally also tormented Ralph Macchio in " The Karate Kid . " Terry doesn't know much about being a boy , but never fear - - her little brother , who names his penis Spike , does , and he teaches her all the basics , like how to scratch her balls .
573701	4532636	923600	8.0	There's More Than One Use for a Shopping Bag	In " Baghead , " Matt , Chad , Katherine and Michelle are four Hollywood wannabes who go to a secluded cabin to write a screenplay . They get pretty much no work done , but spend plenty of time over petty practical jokes and obsessions with who likes who and who's screwing who . Things get weird when a strange figure wearing a bag over his head begins appearing in the woods , freaking all of them out to a progressively greater degree . " Baghead " is one of those reflexive films about the process of making films . It blurs the line between reality and fiction , and whether intentional or not , it questions whether or not the democratization of film-making is good for the art form . Any four yahoos with a portable camera can now make a movie , but just because a movie is cheap and made outside of the Hollywood system does not make it automatically better . At the film's beginning , the four attend a screening of an underground film made for under $1 , 000 by a director they obviously worship , and I was never sure whether " Baghead " itself was an attempt at creating the kind of low-budget quality film the characters in it admire or whether it was poking fun at the whole idea . Maybe it's both . Whatever its intentions , I liked the film , and especially liked where it went in its final moments , when these four rather boring people we've spent over an hour with become actual characters who we discover we actually care about .
574046	4532636	104466	8.0	Husbands and Wives and Foxes and Hedgehogs	When I was much younger and pretentious and just discovering Woody Allen movies , I thought the world of elite intellectuals in which his movies are so often set looked appealing and exciting , and I liked to think of myself as belonging to it some day . Now that I'm much older and have more life experience under my belt , I watch a movie like " Husbands and Wives " and thank God that I don't know any people like the characters in it . " Husbands and Wives " is a very accomplished film , but it came awfully close at times to making me utterly frustrated . It's about a bunch of privileged intellectuals with far too much time on their hands , which they spend dithering about philosophical and emotional conundrums that are boring to everyone but themselves . The saving grace of the film is the fact that Allen seems to be somewhat bored with them too , and suggests that the way to ensure you won't have a fulfilling or satisfying relationship is to analyze and worry it to death . The film is full of some of the most unlikable characters Allen has ever created , notably Sydney Pollack's total ass of an adulterer and Mia Farrow's frumpy drip of a wife . The standout in the cast is Judy Davis , who plays Pollack's estranged wife with a brilliant combination of broad comedy and pathos . She's hilariously believable as a woman who struggles to convey a confidence she doesn't feel , and one of the film's highlights is a scene in which she mentally begins labeling everyone she knows as either a fox or a hedgehog while in the middle of having sex with Liam Neeson . The film also has a part for Allen himself , as a literature professor and writer who flirts with the idea of starting up with one of his students , played by Juliette Lewis . Allen chose to shoot the film as if it were a documentary , with lots of hand-held camera-work and confessional monologues delivered directly at the viewer . I understand why he did it , but it still feels unnecessary and hurts more than it helps .
574475	4532636	22286	8.0	Cagney Commands the Streets of Chicago	Take him or leave him , one can't deny the tremendous screen presence of James Cagney . " The Public Enemy , " which launched Cagney into the Hollywood big time , doesn't so much tell one cohesive story as much as it offers a series of vignettes linked by Cagney's sheer star power . Cagney is Tom Powers , childhood hoodlum who grows up to become an adult hoodlum and meets his end as part of a bloody gang war in 1920 Chicago . The film is positioned as part morality tale , part public service message . A title card at the film's opening announces that the filmmakers in no way mean to glamorize the gangster life , while one placed at the end announces a call to action on the part of the American public to bring an end to the seedy underworld portrayed in the movie . And to the film's credit , despite stylish direction by William Wellman and an intensely charismatic performance from Cagney , it sticks to its promise . The film has an invigorating energy , but it never once glamorizes Cagney or his lifestyle . There are a number of truly memorable moments in this film . Of course the famous grapefruit scene has gone down in film annals as one of them , but I was most struck by the film's shocking finale , in which the body of Cagney is dropped off at the front door of his home while his mother happily changes the sheets of his bed upstairs , thinking that " coming home " means that her son is coming home alive . Another dazzling segment is the one in which Cagney seeks revenge on the gang that killed his best friend . We see him staking out the pool hall where they have gathered , with a truly frightening and psychotic expression on his face . Then he walks through the rain directly toward the camera until his face fills the frame . After he enters the pool hall , we hear shots and a man screaming while the camera stays focused on the exterior of the building . Cagney then emerges , wounded and staggering through the rain . The whole segment feels much more violent than it actually is , because of the effective use of camera and sound ( which was in its infancy , but which Wellman uses superbly ) . Most of the other actors come off poorly next to Cagney , because his style of acting was so different from the conventions of the time . Donald Cook , playing Cagney's war-hero brother , overacts to the hilt , with one foot firmly planted in silent films . A couple of females are thrown in as eye candy , but absolutely no attempt is made to develop their characters . Joan Blondell is cute and sexy , but Jean Harlow is dreadful . How this ugly , clunking , horrible actress ever achieved stardom is beyond me . And as frequently happens with pre-Code cinema , I was taken aback by material that you never think of appearing in films from this time period . It makes overt fun of gays and Jews , frankly addresses sex , and , most strikingly , makes a parallel between gangsters and soldiers , claiming that both murder but for different reasons . Ten years later a comment like that would NEVER appear in a Hollywood film , and movies wouldn't be comfortable criticizing war again until the 1970s . " The Public Enemy " is rough around the edges . You can still feel the various artists involved trying to feel their way around the new era of motion pictures , and as a result , parts of the film are uneven . But it's a striking and remarkable movie that , despite limitations placed on it by the time period and the technology available , packs a gangster-sized punch .
574093	4532636	1068649	8.0	Kristin Scott Thomas Gives One of the Must-See Performances of 2008	As I catch up on the movies released in 2008 that did NOT receive Academy Award nominations , I find myself more and more convinced that the Academy seriously botched things this year . How in the world did the Academy NOT nominate Kristin Scott Thomas for her riveting and heart-breaking performance in " I've Loved You So Long . " Thomas plays Juliette , a woman who's been released from 15 years of prison after killing her own son . She's taken in by her sister , who was a teenager when the two last saw each other . Now the two have to start virtually from scratch , as strangers with a common past . Juliette is withdrawn and lifeless , at first justifying the label of cold , merciless child killer that the world wants to pin on her . But as the movie progresses , we see life return to her , and we learn the reason that led her to do what she did . That reason is revealed in the last moments of the film , but what impressed me about the movie , and about Thomas's performance , is that I almost no longer cared why she had done what she did by the time I found out . I still wanted to know out of curiosity , but I don't know that it would have changed my opinion of the character . She was clearly a warm , kind person with the capacity for great love . She clearly was struggling with demons she didn't want anybody to see . Thomas does an amazing thing - - she makes us care deeply for a woman who doesn't ask for or want our sympathy , and this despite the fact that we know she did something most of us , without knowing the circumstances behind the act , would count as unforgivable . Just watch Thomas's face when she visits her ill mother for the first time since going to prison , a woman withering away with dementia in a nursing home , or her face when her sister's family and new-found friends surprise her with a birthday party , and tell me that Angelina Jolie deserved a best actress nomination instead .
574134	4532636	57163	8.0	Angst in the Heartland	I don't know why anyone would want to live in Texas after the big-screen depictions of it as a place full of nothing but boredom and misery . Surely it can't be that bad . Well , " Hud " certainly makes it seem like it is . This bleak and depressing story shows Hud ( Paul Newman ) , only surviving son of a farm owner ( Melvyn Douglas ) who has found him to be nothing but a disappointment , selfishly whiling away the hours in Nowheresville , Texas . Newman portrays Hud as almost ridiculously virile and full of annoying machismo . His character doesn't know how to interact with anyone on a genuine level , so he instead uses aggression ( physical , verbal , and sexual ) as his only means of communication . It's a great performance by Newman , but the character as written isn't fully fleshed out , and it's hard to ever feel anything but dislike for Hud . Also great in the film is Patricia Neal , who dubiously won the Best Actress Academy Award for her performance as the live-in housekeeper who finds Hud obnoxious and alluring at the same time . Her performance is obviously a supporting one and should in no way be considered a lead ( though she really is the only female character in the movie ) , but she's great in it , and I only wish she was in the film more . Rounding out the cast of characters is Hud's nephew , son of his dead brother , played by Brandon de Wilde ( of " Shane " fame ) , who's also very good . Every actor has a natural style of delivery that makes this film seem so much more contemporary than other ' 63 releases . " Hud " is an incredibly sombre film . Don't go into this expecting to be cheered . Characters continuously reach out for human contact and repeatedly find none . But it's a very solid film , if a bit heavy-handed at times , and the acting is by far its greatest asset .
573362	4532636	58536	8.0	. . . . Or , the Tale of a Young Homosexual's Acceptance	O . k . I'm being a smart ass , but does anyone else see how you can read homosexual undertones into this story ? The " misfits " who don't fit in . The dad who's disappointed with his son for not being " manly " enough . The fear and suspicion of those who are " normal . " Oh , what has our jaded society done to these once innocent classics ? I loved this film as a kid , and love it now . It's got terrific songs , and wonderful narration from Burl Ives , whose warm-rum voice is forever associated in my mind with the title song , Gene Autry or no Gene Autry . Though on watching this again recently , I was surprised by the story involving the abominable snow monster . I could have sworn that he was cranky because of a toothache and that the little dentist elf made him happy when he pulled his tooth . Don't know where I got that . My favorite character is Yukon Cornelius - - he's a hoot whenever he licks the end of his pick to see if there's any silver or gold on it , and then says , with disgust , " Nuthin ' . "
573325	4532636	31762	8.0	And You Thought FedEx Delivery Men Had It Rough	A very strange movie in its own way , " Only Angels Have Wings " is about a group of mail carriers living , working and carousing somewhere in South America . Supposedly it's very dangerous to fly mail back and forth from this particular frontier town , and the life expectancy of a flier isn't long . Therefore , when sexy Jean Arthur shows up on a stop-over and gets a hankering for boss Cary Grant , the sexual tension rests in whether or not Grant will be alive long enough to make forming a romantic attachment worthwhile . With a second world war looming on the horizon , one can see how this story was both relevant and irrelevant at the same time : relevant as a parallel for the many American men who would soon be in the position of not knowing whether or not they would be alive from day to day ; but sort of irrelvant too , since we're talking about delivering mail here , not going to war ! ! I can't imagine a movie made today about the dangers of being a FedEx delivery man ( unless you count " Cast Away " ) . Anyway , Cary Grant is horribly miscast as the crusty man in charge , who puts up a callous front and tries to convince everyone that he doesn't care when one of his men dies . I can only take Grant seriously when he's in a tuxedo and being dapper ; here they outfit him in ridiculous parachute pants pulled up to his nipples - - - I kept expecting him to drop to the floor and start break dancing . As for the female lead , Jean Arthur could do no wrong , as far as I'm concerned . Rita Hayworth shows up in an early role as another love interest for Grant , and one-time silent film star Richard Barthelmess struts in playing Grant's mail carrier arch rival ( ! ) , looking for all the world like he's still acting in silent films . Director Howard Hawks creates an authentically foggy and sweaty South American atmosphere , and for all the surface silliness of the plot , he fashions a pretty compelling movie about the instinct to challenge death that dominates these characters ' lives . I don't hear this movie mentioned along with the other classics released in the golden year of 1939 , but it more than holds its own against the more popular films of that year .
573417	4532636	299977	8.0	Visual Poetry	" Hero " is a jaw-droppingly gorgeous film that is truly worth seeing for its lush production design alone . Director Zhang Yimou brings a visual elegance to the kung-fu genre film , and a magical realist sensibility to the narrative itself , the results of which are a very violent film where the violence seems to have consequences , and the line between hero and villain isn't so much a line as a vast field of shaded grey . The film is reminiscent of " Rashomon " in its fragmented approach to telling its story ; one is never sure whether or not the version he is hearing is the truth . That may be because in the world of " Hero , " the truth is very open to interpretation - - one man's noble act is another man's crime . The film pays its respects to various art forms , all of which are compared to the artistry of swordplay : music , literature , dance . Just as a skilled swordsman can yield nearly unstoppable power , so can the artist impact the world around him . No one will accuse Yimou of being a subtle director , and I do have to say that the continuous fighting gets ever so slightly monotonous . Yimou does a good job of combating this monotony by changing the color palettes and showcasing increasingly dazzling choreography , but when the character of Snow challenges the character of Broken Sword to a duel for what feels like the fiftieth time toward the film's conclusion , I sympathized with Broken Sword when he says , " Must violence always be the answer ( paraphrased ) . " Still , this is a minor quibble , and one must also remember that this film is working within the confines of its genre , and that that's just how these films are .
574021	4532636	379725	8.0	Highly Intelligent Look Into the Mind of an Artist	The recent onslaught of bland , paint-by-number Hollywood biopics may leave you completely disinterested in seeing " Capote , " the new film about eccentric author Truman Capote , directed by Bennett Miller and starring the chameleon Philip Seymour Hoffman . I hope you will reconsider if that is the case . " Capote " is not a biopic in the style of last year's overrated " Ray " - - - show childhood of celebrity ( ideally working in some liberal doses of strife or abuse if possible ) , show scrappy rise of celebrity from modest beginnings , show celebrity reach peak status , show celebrity self-destruct ( usually due to drugs and / or alcohol ) , show celebrity hit rock-bottom , show celebrity seek peace and affirmation , and end on fuzzy , heart-warming scene in which celebrity is honored with a standing ovation as the soundtrack music swells . " Capote " is not that kind of film . In fact , " Capote " is not really about the life of Truman Capote , but rather is about the chain of events that led to Capote writing the book for which he is best known , " In Cold Blood . " This is perhaps the most intelligent film I've ever seen about the relationship between an artist / journalist and the subject about which he is writing . The movie asks : how morally responsible is a writer for his subject ? As depicted in this film , Capote becomes fascinated by a brutal crime in a tiny Kansas town , in which two men brutally murdered an entire family because they thought a large amount of money was hidden in the house . As he spends a great deal of time with one of the men ( Perry Smith ) and begins to piece together his story , he becomes personally interested in helping him fight his case ; eventually , however , Capote's desire to write a work of art overrides the personal interest he's taken in Perry Smith , and he leaves the prisoner clinging to a false hope that Capote is bringing the " true " story ( that is , the story of the men's innocence , though they're not innocent ) to the world . Miller's film is unflinching in its portrayal of Capote as a selfish artist who plays with the lives of his creations ; it's as if he's become so used to writing fiction that he forgets he is telling the story of real people , and moreover real people who trust him to have their best interests at heart . Hoffman has been great in just about every movie he's appeared in , so it was no surprise to me that he would be great here as well . His performance is more than a mere impersonation . He is so good at showing the audience the two sides of Capote : the endearing , lovable side that make people want to trust him ; and the cold , manipulative side that takes over when he becomes Capote the artist . It's to Hoffman's credit that you don't leave the film necessarily despising Capote for his actions , but neither do you feel like you've just participated in a two-hour session of hero worship . Catherine Keener drabs down to play novelist Harper Lee ; Clifton Collins , Jr . is soft and articulate as Perry Smith , which makes his final confession of the murders all the more chilling ; and Chris Cooper adds another fine character performance to his list of character performances as head of the Holcomb , Kansas police department , leading the investigation . My only problem with the film is its monotonous pacing . I feel like the film makers wanted so hard to avoid any of the artificial traditional Hollywood trappings that they felt any burst of energy or activity would be betraying the film's realism . " Capote " is a fine addition to the genre of films committed to exploring the motivations that drive artists , and Hoffman may finally get his due from the mainstream establishment for his award-worthy performance .
573448	4532636	84707	8.0	Soap Opera with Superb Acting	A high-brow soap opera , but an awfully good one . Meryl Streep delivers an absolutely heartbreaking performance as Sophie , a woman who was forced to make a terrible choice during WWII that haunts her for the rest of her life . The choice is so horrific it can't even be comprehended ; therefore , it's a bit tacky that it's used as one of those last-minute plot reveals to make an emotional impact . Streep's performance , though , is never tacky - - it's deeply sincere . Kevin Kline , of all people , delivers a frightening performance as Sophie's abusive boyfriend . It's hard to reconcile the Kevin Kline in this film with the one who would play such nutty characters in later films . Even if you're resistant to the film's melodramatic pandering , it's hard not to be moved by it .
574456	4532636	39973	8.0	Forgotten Thriller Is a Lot of Fun	A nifty little thriller that has lawyer Edmond O'Brien hired as bodyguard for business tycoon Vincent Price . Of course it doesn't take a detective to figure out that someone is setting someone else up , nor does it take a college diploma to figure out who those someones might be . Still , the cast ( which also includes Ella Raines and William Bendix ) is obviously enjoying themselves here , and if they're not going to take things too seriously , why should you ? It's best not to think too hard about the plot developments ( like why would a tycoon hire a lawyer to be his bodyguard in the first place ? ) and just enjoy the slick ride .
573521	4532636	90605	8.0	James Cameron's Powerhouse Sequel to " Alien "	Say what you will about James Cameron's attempts at more " serious " film-making ( " Titanic " ? Ha ! ) , the man does know how to put together an action movie . He takes a completely different approach to this second film in the " Alien " series than Ridley Scott did to the first - - whereas Scott's film was slow , creepy and scarier for what you didn't see than for what you did , Cameron's is nearly non-stop hard-core action . It works though , and for all the difference in their styles , the two films cohere very well together . In this sequel , the focus moves away from the science / research angle of the first and instead focuses on a group of marines sent to a ghost town of a space station to investigate the disappearance of the colonists . Ripley ( Sigourney Weaver ) is along for the ride again , and Cameron uses her fear of what they could potentially be walking into effectively . Whereas in the first one , we were scared because we shared the scientists ' cluelessness about what was going on and only learned things as they learned them , in this one we're scared in the same way Ripley is , precisely because we know what's going on and how terrifying it is . And Cameron ups the ante here - - instead of one single alien as a nemesis , this group of marines has to deal with hundreds of them . I'm not really a fan of the subplot involving Newt , the little girl the marines find and who forms an attachment to Ripley . But the story does give Ripley's character a lot of motivation and makes her stand off with the aliens much more personal . I've seen this film a few times , so you'd think it wouldn't hold any suspense for me now , but I just watched it again over the weekend and damned if I wasn't on the edge of my seat .
574379	4532636	381849	8.0	This Wild West Belongs to Christian Bale and Russell Crowe	I went into " 3 : 10 to Yuma " with fairly low expectations , given James Mangold's track record as a mediocre director and the fact that I'm not necessarily a fan of westerns . How pleasantly surprised I was , then , to find that this particular western is slick and supremely entertaining . " 3 : 10 to Yuma " has all the trappings of the traditional western - - outlaws , humble ranchers , gunslingers , salty old-timers , buxom saloon barmaids - - but Russell Crowe and Christian Bale , the outlaw and humble rancher , respectively , bring a contemporary sensibility to the material that feels integrated rather than incongruous . Bale's rancher , Dan Evans , is suffering from feelings of male inadequacy as a result of being on the brink of losing his farm to debt ( he's already lost a leg to the Civil War ) . For two hundred dollars , he joins a group of upright townies who are escorting Ben Wade , vicious bad guy ( Crowe ) , to the train that will take him to Yuma prison . But Wade's loyal band , led by Charlie Price ( Ben Foster as the film's one weak link , giving a grating performance ) , won't let Wade go without a fight . Through clever writing and wonderful performances by Bale and Crowe , the two men almost become allies in making sure Wade gets to the train on time . Wade is so impressed with Evans ' integrity , even though he doesn't understand it , that he almost wants to see Evans succeed , even if that means he himself goes to jail . It's really a fascinating relationship , and it's that element of the film that makes it more than just a standard genre exercise . The last quarter of the film is a nailbiter ; Mangold falls back on that old reliable convention that westerns practically invented , the real time show down , with clocks placed here and there keeping time for the audience , and he does it well . The film belongs to Bale and Crowe , but there's strong acting throughout by the rest of the cast , notably Gretchen Mol in a few brief scenes as Evans ' wife and Peter Fonda as the requisite crusty old-timer .
574034	4532636	49223	8.0	Where the Wild Things Are	This sombre sci-fi film can't help but look dated , and it's full of the usual cheesy 1950s sci-fi trappings , but one can't deny the influence it clearly had on the genre , and one can see the thumbprint of this film on any number of subsequent science fiction offerings . A very young Leslie Nielsen plays the leader of a group of American astronauts sent to a distant planet to find out what happened to a previous group of explorers . He comes across a man ( Walter Pidgeon ) and his daughter ( Anne Francis ) living alone with their robot servant ( Robby ) . Pidgeon has discovered the advanced technology left behind by a previous race of beings , the ability to harness inconceivable power through mind control . But Nielsen realizes that Pidgeon's subconscious is truly in control , and it's responsible for creating the monster that wiped out the former group of American visitors and comes to decimate Nielsen's crew as well . The love story between Nielsen and Anne Francis , whose role consists almost entirely of skipping around in miniskirts , would feel obligatory in any other sci-fi film , but here it takes on interesting dimensions . The presence of a woman brings out the animal sexual urges in the American crew ( who haven't seen a woman for a very long time ) , a theme that ties into the idea that mankind's largest obstacle to progress are its own base urges . " Forbidden Planet " suggests that the scariest monsters come not from the depths of space , but rather from the dark corners of man's own mind . What helps " Forbidden Planet " to stay fresh despite its dated look is its message about the responsibility man has to use wisely the technology he creates . The fact that much of the technology we have created over the years is responsible for beginning the slow death of our planet makes the film not only relevant , but prophetic . The movie is unsettling in an undefined way . It's not full of action , space wars , bizarre aliens or any of that . It's quiet and abstract , and it's more about ideas than it is plot .
573374	4532636	63518	8.0	Probably the Best Version of Shakespeare's Tragedy We're Ever to Get	This filmed version of one of Shakespeare's most famous tragedies is likely to be about as good a version as will ever be produced . Director Franco Zeffirelli had warmed up the year before with the Burton / Taylor version of " The Taming of the Shrew , " but here he nicely transitions from the frantic comedy of the former to the darker and sadder tragedy of this story about star-crossed lovers ( played by Leonard Whiting and the famously big-bosomed Olivia Hussey ) . Zeffirelli infuses the film with the same kind of restless energy that was feeding the youth movement in 1968 , so this is one Shakespeare film that feels completely relevant to the time in which it was released . The film has beautiful production values ( the scene at the ball is a work of art all by itself ) and of course that famous musical theme . It shows reverence for the original text but doesn't feel stage-bound or stodgy ; yet neither does it feel like a product of trendy 60s cinema . And unlike the Baz Luhrmann debacle that passed as a version of " Romeo and Juliet " about 10 years ago , the actors in this version seem to both understand their characters and the lines they've been given to read .
573324	4532636	32551	9.0	Not the Book , But Beautiful in Its Own Right	It's difficult on a first viewing of " The Grapes of Wrath " not to be somewhat disappointed with it . So much of Steinbeck's beautiful novel is left out of the film , and it's hard to see his story and characters wedged into the " gee whizz " style of film-making so prevalent at the time . But once you get beyond a comparison of the movie to the book , you begin to realize that John Ford created a beautiful piece of work of his own , and the film inspires a great deal of admiration , and deserves credit for its gutsiness at tackling a story that wouldn't have gone down smoothly with film executives at the time . Of course the most controversial parts of the book are left out ( like its final image , for example ) , but Ford still managed to work around the constraints forced upon him to fashion a hard-biting film . Henry Fonda is perfect casting for Tom Joad - - never have his otherworldly eyes been used to greater effect . And Jane Darwell is pitch-perfect as Ma Joad - - she captures the tough-as-nails dignity that the character has in the novel . The whole movie is lit by expert cinematographer Gregg Toland , who uses shadow and reflection to cast a ghostly pall over everything . Indeed , much of what Ford wasn't able to include in the film as words he communicates instead through images , and isn't that what a good book-to-film adaptation should do ? One of those films that feels ahead of its time .
573894	4532636	87553	9.0	A Rousing Film About a Bloody Subject	A visceral , kinetic and exciting film from Roland Joffe ( whatever happened to him ? ) . Set against the bloody backdrop of Cambodia during the civil war that saw the surge of the Khmer Rouge , " The Killing Fields " tells the story of an interpreter ( the non-actor Haing S . Ngor ) who befriends an American journalist ( Sam Waterston ) and then descends into the nightmare of Cambodia while Waterston sits helplessly in America wondering if his friend is dead or alive . It's one of those liberal films Hollywood loves to make , that asks us to feel guilty about our cushy American lives even as people in other countries are being butchered . It's not heavy handed or manipulative though , and Joffe films the whole thing with a journalistic approach that fits the subject matter and lends the film a documentary-like quality . Ngor , who had never acted before , is amazing , and though Waterston gets top billing as the most recognizable actor , Ngor is the film's true star .
574208	4532636	50212	9.0	A Beautiful Film About the Delicacy of Humanity	With " The Bridge on the River Kwai , " David Lean launched the string of " epics-with-a-soul " that would dominate the remainder of his career . In " Kwai , " Lean deftly juggles what seem like two entirely different movies to create one strong indictment of war's ability to strip men of their humanity . In one plot line , Alec Guinness , a British officer being held in a Japanese prison camp , locks horns with the commander of the camp ( Sessue Hayakawa ) , who puts Guinness and the other British soldiers in charge of constructing a bridge that will help the Japanese in their struggle to win the war . In the other dominant plot line , William Holden plays the leader of a platoon of men charged with blowing up said bridge . This plot line plays out like an exciting but fairly standard action film . It's the fascinating story of Guinness's transformation , not to mention his spectacular performance , that gives the film its status as a classic . The same quality of British perseverance that made Guinness such a loyal officer for the Allies works in Japanese favor as he becomes committed to building as fine a bridge as possible , forgetting its ultimate purpose . The film very eloquently communicates how noble attributes like loyalty and honor can be manipulated to satisfy what in certain circumstances can be perceived to be dubious ends , which , when you think about it ( though few people want to ) characterizes the basis of military recruitment everywhere . " Kwai " joined a batch of other 1957 releases - - like " 12 Angry Men , " " Paths of Glory " and " Sweet Smell of Success " - - in introducing a grittier and at the same time more poetic style of film-making that looked forward to the art-house style that would come into its own throughout the 1960s .
573399	4532636	70379	9.0	The One That Started It All	" Mean Streets " is the film that put Martin Scorsese on the map and established him as a serious talent to watch . In many ways , Scorsese has simply been remaking the same story ever since this one , but I think that " Mean Streets " ( along with much of his 1970s work ) has a much grittier and authentic quality to it than the movies he's been making in the last couple of decades . " GoodFellas " and " The Departed " are certainly expert movies , and they're wildly enjoyable , but you can tell that Scorsese's primary motivation in these films was to entertain , while in his 1970s movies he was passionately driven to tell particular stories . Featuring soon-to-become Scorsese regulars Robert DeNiro and Harvey Keitel , both delivering top-notch performances .
574405	4532636	85461	9.0	Finney and Courtenay Work Wonders Together	" The Dresser " is a small but absolutely wonderful film , brilliantly acted by Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay . How in the world this tiny film attracted enough attention to garner five major Academy Award nominations back in 1983 is a mystery to me , but it's nice to know the Academy can be guilty of a display of good taste every once in a while ( of course , they gave the award that year to " Terms of Endearment " - - after all , they don't want to be accused of showing TOO much taste ) . Albert Finney is a drunken Shakespearean actor in a production of " King Lear " ; Tom Courtenay is the man who works double time behind the scenes to keep this actor in front of the footlights . It's both hilarious and piteous to see Courtenay's character showering Finney's with attention and affection , only to see his efforts utterly unappreciated and dismissed , even up to the very bitter end . Finney and Courtenay work wonders together , and though Finney gets the showiest moments ( he does get to recite Shakespeare after all ) , Courtenay is the heart and soul of the film .
574200	4532636	60176	9.0	Further Proof That Swinging London Was a Myth	Perhaps the most accessible film Michelangelo Antonioni ever made , " Blowup " joins the same year's " Alfie " to create a set of movie bookends that puncture the idea of a free and swinging 1960s London where one's personal actions have no consequences on others . " Blowup , " however , is a much more intellectually challenging and stimulating film than " Alfie . " David Hemmings plays a free-wheeling and womanizing photographer who , while taking pictures of a beautiful young woman in a park ( Vanessa Redgrave , looking beautiful indeed ) , inadvertently captures what appears to be a murder being committed in some foliage in the background . Think of this as a companion film to " The Conversation , " with a photograph taking the place of a sound recording . The idea at first haunts Hemmings and then obsesses him , and his life begins slowly to unravel . This is Antonioni , so nothing takes place as neatly and clearly as I've layed it out for you here , and the ending is especially enigmatic , but " Blowup " makes for a fascinating watch , and it will likely tantalize and haunt you as much as those blurry images tantalize and haunt the film's protagonist .
574187	4532636	64276	9.0	The Myth of the American Dream	" Easy Rider " likely made a generation of young men want to take to the road on motorbikes , sticking it to the man and living the American dream . And today , it's viewed nostalgically as a relic from a simpler , more innocent time . But I think it's wrong to read the film this way , and robs it of much of its impact . " Easy Rider " isn't about living the American dream ; it's about finding out there is no such thing . That's what I like most about this movie . Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda could have made a smug , alienating critique on bourgeois American culture , and it's rather surprising that they didn't . Instead , they made a disturbing film with a big heart at its center , about two drifters who go out in search of what makes America great , and find that there's no place in it for them . The ending packs a wallop , and I'm always amazed that two newbies who were probably both loopy most of the time on drugs could manage to put together such a strong , resonant film . Jack Nicholson appears in a supporting role as another drifter the two pick up on their travels , and the always fascinating Karen Black appears briefly as well as one of their female companions .
574480	4532636	27532	9.0	A Minor Classic	" Dodsworth " is a disarmingly honest and frank depiction of a failed marriage , based on the Sinclair Lewis novel . Its naturalistic acting and its refusal to make its characters anything less than full-bodied human beings make it feel way ahead of its time . It's never mentioned along with other classic films of the period - - probably because it doesn't have an epic scope - - but it should be . Walter Huston gives an absolutely flawless performance in the title role . His type is so recognizable , even today : the successful American business man who values the simplest and most traditional of American values , and who comes across as provincial and crass to the rest of the world . Ruth Chatterton meets Huston's performance every step of the way as Dodsworth's wife , glad of the material comfort her husband can provide , but embarrassed by him and aware that he will prevent her from joining the world of high culture to which she wants to belong . It is to the movie's distinct credit that neither of these characters is either hero or villain . Dodsworth is crass and unsophisticated ; yet at the same time he's honest and never misleads his wife into thinking he's something that he's not . Mrs . Dodsworth has a right to be bored by the kind of life Dodsworth is content with , but she might have thought of that before so readily accepting his financial success . I don't really know for sure , but I have a feeling this movie might have made people very uncomfortable in 1936 . I doubt married couples were encouraged to turn too critical an eye on their own marriages back then , and I suspect that more people than not decided to stick it out in unhappy marriages rather than violate a sense of social propriety . Before the days when people dated for a few years before getting married , many people probably learned about the kind of person they were marrying only after the wedding day . " Dodsworth " beautifully captures the sad , melancholy feeling of waking up one morning and realizing you're not married to the person you thought you were .
574444	4532636	47811	10.0	Douglas Sirk at the Peak of His Artistry	Jane Wyman gives a winsome and luminous performance in this achingly beautiful Douglas Sirk weepie . Wyman plays a dutiful 1950s widow , going through the motions in a straight-laced , stifling suburb . Her children are college age and live away from home ; her life has settled into a boring routine . She falls for gardener Rock Hudson , who not only is younger than her but also is ( GASP ! ) poorer . Marriage to him would mean facing the harsh criticism of the snobbish New England society to which she belongs - - even her children oppose the match . But Wyman's character harbors a strong-willed spirit which bristles at the conventions forced upon her . If this premise sounds familiar , it should - - Todd Haynes borrowed it for his homage to Sirk's melodramas , " Far From Heaven " ( 2002 ) . In that film , he reexamined Sirk's critique of mainstream upper middle class America and the banality forced upon anyone who wishes to belong to that class . Haynes's film is edgier than Sirk's - - a more liberated culture allowed him to explore racism and homophobia in addition to class barriers . But Sirk's film is no less powerful or devastating despite the limitations placed upon it . In my mind , Sirk held a unique place among film directors . He made art out of pure melodrama , something not many could do . The same stories filmed by other directors would be easy to dismiss as cornball entertainment - - but it's not so easy to dismiss Sirk . He attacked conventions that at the time were taken for granted as being desirable for anyone wanting to live the American dream ; but his attacks , if not his films , were subtle , and he made his movies for the very audience at whom he was aiming his criticism . No other Sirk film matches " All That Heaven Allows " for sheer craftsmanship , not even the wildly feverish " Written on the Wind , " released a year later . And Jane Wyman was a perfect Sirk heroine ; she was able to deftly navigate the cornball elements and create a character who you both believe in and care deeply for .
574201	4532636	61184	10.0	A Harrowing , Disturbing Film with a Dazzling Performance from Liz Taylor	I've heard many reports that the screen version of Edward Albee's Pulitzer-Prize-winning play greatly dilutes the content and language of the original text , blunting some of its emotional impact . Well , if this is the blunted version , I don't know if I'm prepared for the original . Richard Burton ( who I've never really liked as an actor , but who I have to admit does brilliant work here ) and Elizabeth Taylor ( in the definitive performance of her career ) go at each other like two inmates in a prison brawl , and the results are devastating . To see two people who obviously have a deep bond but who are so intent on deeply hurting each other is enough to make your skin crawl . At the root of their misery is a child , or rather the lack of one , and unable to deal with their own emotional crises , they instead turn their troubles into a grotesque game , where hurting each other becomes perversely the only thing that brings them comfort , because it's less scary than the prospect of facing the skeletons they've packed away in the closets . Burton's George is a loathsome character , a nasty yet beaten man who seems nearly inhuman in his ability to repress any show of true emotion . Taylor's Martha is one of the most fascinating female creations ever put on the stage or the screen , and Taylor tears into the role as if her life depended on it . Ultimately , it's her who will break your heart , this woman who has turned into something everyone detests in an attempt to wring from her husband a sign that she and their marriage still matter to him . I'll never forget the feeling of hollowed-out despair this movie left me with after my first viewing . George Segal and Sandy Dennis play the young couple who suffer the force of George and Martha's attack . They serve as reminders of what George and Martha perhaps once were , while George and Martha serve as warnings of what the younger couple could become .
574508	4532636	112818	10.0	Exceptional Examination of the Death Penalty Issue	A stunning film about a nun ( Susan Sarandon ) enlisted to comfort a death row inmate ( Sean Penn ) in the days leading up to his execution and the tentative friendship the two develop . Sarandon and Penn are at the top of their game , as is director Tim Robbins , who uses his film not as a liberal diatribe against the death penalty , but rather as a tool for fairly examining both sides of the issue . Whether or not you believe in the death penalty , or whether or not you believe the Penn character deserves to die for his crimes , is beside the point - - I defy anyone to watch this film and not at least be somewhat moved by the sheer warm pulse of humanity that courses through it . I remember being unable to speak walking out of the theatre after seeing this for fear that I would burst into tears .
574025	4532636	433383	10.0	Best Film About American Media Since " Network "	Every once in a while , a character actor who has made a living popping up here and there in mostly unmemorable roles , is cast in a film and does such an amazing job that everyone starts immediately wondering why he or she isn't more famous . However , if you think about it , this sort of makes sense . Character actors don't carry around the baggage of being big-name Hollywood personas ; they can entirely sink into a role and not fight audience tendencies to watch them as a celebrity rather than as a character . This works even more to their advantage when they're asked to play real people . I'm not even that familiar with Edward R . Murrow , the famous American newscaster who waged a media war that eventually brought down Joseph McCarthy , but even if David Strathairn comes nowhere close to accurately impersonating Murrow , he gives a fantastic and intense performance . This movie is a terse , succinct account of the Murrow / McCarthy debates ; there's not really a wasted moment or one single superfluous scene or line of dialogue . George Clooney ( who deserves much credit for his work as director on the film ) plays Fred Friendly , producer at CBS and , as portrayed here , Murrow's chief ally . The chemistry between he and Strathairn is terrific , especially in a scene toward the end of the film when they both have their hands slapped by the head of CBS , played by Frank Langella . Despite the fact that he appears in virtually every scene , and as good as he is , Strathairn does not walk away with the picture ; it's a generous lead performance in that he allows every other actor , even in mostly small roles , to shine ( Clooney should probably be credited for this as well ) . Robert Downey , Jr . and Patricia Clarkson play a secretly married couple who work on Murrow's news team . Their storyline might feel unnecessary on a casual viewing , but I thought it brought a nice dose of humanism to the film , and reminded the viewer that the war against McCarthyism was not simply an effort to save careers and professional reputations , but also to save personal and private lives . The movie is so tightly contained and so confined to the world of the news room , that it would be easy not to think of anyone in the film as having actual lives beyond the ones they lead at CBS , and the Clarkson / Downey , Jr . storyline is a clever way to convey that . And let me throw in one last bit of praise for another actor , Jeff Daniels , who in recent years has really impressed me with his versatility , and makes quite an impression in this film in only two or three brief scenes . " Good Night , and Good Luck " is unashamedly one-sided . Clooney obviously has very strong feelings about the role media should play in American culture , and the responsibility news providers should feel in brining the public what they think the public needs , not necessarily what it wants . Given the fact that a recent devastating earthquake in Pakistan has been all but ignored by American media in favor of World Series coverage , I'd say this message has significant relevance . And in the lessons learned by the McCarthy debacle , it's not hard to draw a parallel to the current Bush Administration , and its efforts to label anyone remotely critical of American policy in Iraq as unsupportive of our troops or as unpatriotic , a band wagon on to which too many Americans are jumping for my comfort . I've not seen as good a film about the American media since " Network , " and in some ways I like this movie even more . " Network " is satire , effective satire , but satire nonetheless ; it never feels exactly real . " Good Night . . . " , on the other hand , is remarkable for how authentic it feels ; I never felt like I was watching scripted actors , but rather was watching an especially exciting documentary . This is easily one of the " must see " films of the year .

The rest of the film plays out like a murder mystery , each woman thinking back over her marriage and wondering if her husband's the guilty party . In both this and " All About Eve , " Mankiewicz proved himself to be a wonderful writer for women . He had a knack for addressing some of the negative aspects of the female personality , but in a way that felt honest rather than stereotypical . Many of the usual " types " are present in this film - - the career woman , the golddigger , the man stealer - - but the women themselves are so richly written that they're not easily pigeonholed . Crain plays the country bumpkin who feels inadequate among her affluent husband's set ; Sothern is the working woman who begins to lose her identity to a job ; Darnell is the aforementioned golddigger who treats marriage like a business deal . All three actresses give lovely performances , especially Sothern and Darnell , and the film builds a great deal of suspense as it works toward its revealing conclusion . The supporting cast features Kirk Douglas and Paul Douglas as two of the husbands ; Thelma Ritter , unsurprisingly stealing scenes as Sothern's maid ; and Celeste Holm , heard but never seen as the voice of Addie Ross .
573724	4532636	23622	10.0	No Trouble with This Lubitsch Comedy	That rare thing : the perfect film comedy . " Trouble in Paradise , " Ernst Lubitsch's sparkling 1932 comedy , stars Herbert Marshall and an adorable Miriam Hopkins as con artists in love , while Kay Francis plays the woman who comes between them . The film is fast , sexy , effortless and absolutely charming . People always refer to " the Lubitsch touch " when talking about the famous director's films , and I understand completely what they mean . There's something about his films that's common to all of them but is very hard to describe . It has something to do with tone - - all of his films feel like they're perfectly balanced between humor , sentimentality , pathos and melancholy . They're funny , but none of them feel like insignificant fluff ; there's an underlying strain of melancholy running through all of them , yet none of them make the mistake of taking the world too seriously . I don't know what it was that made his films so delightful , but I love it .
574056	4532636	85794	10.0	One of Scorsese's Best	This hugely underrated film is one of Martin Scorsese's best , and further proof that as a director he has much more range than many might give him credit for . Robert De Niro and Jerry Lewis deliver pitch-perfect performances as a stand-up comic wannabe and a popular T . V . personality , respectively , when their worlds collide due to De Niro's ( whose character's name , Rupert Pupkin , has to be one of the most perfect ever created for a movie role ) fanatic devotion to his idol . It's a subject uncomfortably familiar to Scorsese , given the obsession Ronald Reagan's attempted assassin , John Hinckley , had with Jodie Foster , largely because of her performance in " Taxi Driver . " The tone and storyline to this film were incredibly tricky to pull off . If those involved had carried the humour and slapstick elements of it too far , it might have come across as glib ; but if they played up the disturbing elements too much , it would have ceased to be funny and would have seemed like a warm-over of " Taxi Driver . " As it is , I don't see how the film could be better . De Niro makes his character warm and endearing enough to keep you sympathetic with him , while making him menacing enough to take seriously , while Lewis for once shows himself adept at playing the straight guy , and gives a spectacular performance as a hang-dog celebrity whose quiet and sober personal demeanor is at odds with that of his on-screen personality . And praise also must go to Sandra Bernhard , who gives a delightfully wacky take on another aspiring star and accomplice to Rupert , whose plans go awry in hilarious and unpredictable ways . Bernhard is a ball of energy here , and I've never liked her better . This is truly a must-see film .
573663	4532636	63462	10.0	Don't Be Stupid , Be a Smarty , Come and Join the Nazi Party	Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder aim Mel Brooks ' bawdy jokes at the third balcony , and the result is one of the funniest movies ever made . As anyone who doesn't live under a rock by now knows , Mostel and Wilder play Max Bialystock , failing Broadway producer , and his hysterical accountant , Leo Bloom , respectively . When the two realize that they can make more money off a Broadway flop than they can with a hit , they set out to make the worst show ever made , and " Springtime for Hitler " is born . The fun in " The Producers " is watching Max and Leo assemble their team of show-biz disasters . Not since Dorothy skipped down the yellow brick road on the way to Oz has a more colorful assortment of characters been added one by one to a film's cast . There's the play's author Franz Liebkind , who spontaneously bursts into the Nazi anthem and whose plans include world domination ; Ulla , the Swedish tease , whose hips move independently from her torso and who Max meets in the public library ; Roger DeBris , who thinks the third act of the play " has got to go " because the Nazis are losing the war ; his " assistant " Carmen Ghia , who slinks around wearing a pointy beard and a monocle and who enjoys ( maybe too much ) his ride in the elevator with Max and Leo ; and last but not least , Lorenzo St . DuBois , also known as LSD , who sings perhaps the film's funniest song , " Love Power , " while wearing furry thigh boots and finger cymbals and which ends with him breaking a banana in half and sticking his thumb in his mouth . The high point of the movie , of course , is the " Springtime for Hitler " production number , that includes dancing girls dressed as pretzels and beer tankards and includes lines like " We're marching to a faster pace / Look out , here comes the master race . " Just the shot of the audience watching the show , their mouths hanging open in dumbstruck shock at its awfulness , is alone worth sitting through the movie for . My only complaint with " The Producers " is really a compliment , and it's that there's not enough of it . The whole movie has a sketch-comedy feel , and each supporting character gets really no more than a big scene or two . I really wanted more of Roger and Carmen , and more of LSD . And of course it would have been great if Brooks had filled out " Springtime for Hitler " even more . Indeed , that number is such a show stopper that the movie deflates a bit after it's over and never quite recovers . This is easily Brooks ' best film , and it's wonderful to see such an unapologetically in-your-face comedy work so well . It's crass and crude and silly , yet remarkably intelligent all at the same time . If you don't come away with at least a dozen lines to quote , you weren't paying attention .
574014	4532636	91877	10.0	Be Ruthless - - It's Good for You	" Ruthless People " has one of the best premises in film comedy history . Spandex miniskirt millionaire Sam Stone ( Danny DeVito ) plans to kill his battle axe wife ( Bette Midler ) for her inheritance . However , his plan is put on hold when she is kidnapped and held for ransom . The kidnappers threaten to kill her if Sam doesn't pay , which is a-o . k . with Sam , and means he doesn't have to do his own dirty work . But the kidnappers ( Judge Reinhold and Helen Slater ) are too kind hearted to follow through with what they start . Meanwhile , Sam's floozy mistress ( a smokin ' Anita Morris ) knows about Sam's plans , and sends her doofus boyfriend ( Bill Pullman ) out to videotape what he thinks is Sam killing his wife so that they can blackmail him . This is a lot of plot to cram into a brisk 90 minutes , but this well written film never feels forced or rushed . Every scene conveys something important either for the story or about one of the characters , and not a moment feels wasted . The ensemble is terrific , each actor landing his / her jokes without fail . The standouts , though , are Bette Midler , who gives an outrageously vulgar performance pitched to the third balcony ; and Judge Reinhold , who gives the film its heart . One of the most quotable movies ever , the film also boasts a great opening credits sequence , one more reason to lament the fact that movies hardly ever have opening credits anymore .
574269	4532636	378194	10.0	Vol . 1 Was Dessert - - This Is the Main Course	" Kill Bill Vol . 2 " is the second half of one large story , and it creates a cohesive whole with the first part , but in many ways it's a completely different movie from Vol . 1 . The first half was all about movement - - it was almost balletic in its merging of images and music . Vol . 2 slows down , WAY down , to create a stoic , mythic conclusion . Where events in Vol . 1 rushed by in a glib montage , with blood spewing and limbs flying around the screen in a parody of film violence , everything about Vol . 2 feels heavy with consequence - - - there's much less violence , but what there is feels like it matters far more . Uma Thurman gave a nimble , athletic performance in Vol . 1 , but really impresses here with her ability to get to the dramatic bottom of her character . Beatrix Kiddo's conflict emerges - - - she becomes a flesh and blood human character rather than a comic book hero seeking revenge . David Carradine , as Bill , is the second part's most significant addition , and he plays his part perfectly . And I got a kick out of Daryl Hannah's Elle Driver , who turns in a memorable cameo in the first part , but really gets a chance to strut her stuff in the second . I don't think it's a criticism of Tarantino's films to say that the first part is all style while the second part is the substance ; it's like eating your dessert before the main meal . I think Tarantino would be the first to agree , and both parts exhibit all the signs of being thoughtfully and carefully assembled . One thing you're never in doubt of when dealing with Tarantino is that you're seeing the exact movie he wants you to see . But why spend time worrying about which one is better or which one succeeds more ? They're both part of the same movie - - - one wouldn't exist without the other . And they're both remarkable .
573921	4532636	76759	10.0	The Boy Who Loved " Star Wars "	A long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away . . . . . There was a boy who was only two years old when the original " Star Wars " film was released . He doesn't remember first seeing the movie , but he also doesn't remember life before it . He does remember the first " Star Wars " themed gift he got . . . a shoebox full of action figures from the original set . He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be . But years later , he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received : another box full of action figures , ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection . It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed , Anakin Skywalker , stopped being produced and carried in stores , and how this boy went for about ten years ( until he got into college ) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets ( don't ask . . . it's a Northern Illinois University thing ) . I can't review " Star Wars " as a movie . It represents absolutely everything good , fun and magical about my childhood . There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases , birthdays , summers and winters growing up . In the winter , my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth ( I was always Han Solo ) . My friends ' dad built them a kick-ass tree house , and that served as the Ewok village . They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it , and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home . I am unabashedly dorky when it comes to " Star Wars " and I think people either just understand that or they don't . I don't get the appeal of " Lord of the Rings " or " Star Trek " but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of George Lucas's films . I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time . Every time I put them in the DVD player , I feel like I'm eight years old again , when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of Anakin Skywalker . Grade ( for the entire trilogy ) :
574138	4532636	39689	10.0	The Best 40s Noir	There's nothing wrong with " Out of the Past . " It is hands down the best film noir to be released in the 1940s ( even better than " Double Indemnity , " high praise indeed from me ) , and it rivals " Sunset Boulevard " and " Kiss Me Deadly " as my favorite noir of all time . Robert Mitchum plays a regular Joe , quietly living an ordinary life in some out of the way sleepy American town , whose criminal past catches up with him and refuses to let him go . It's reminiscent of last year's " A History of Violence , " and explores some of the same themes as David Cronenberg's film : Can we forget the past if the past doesn't want to forget us ? Mitchum delivers a spectacular performance ; his craggy , mournful face is the very picture of a man who knows he's living on borrowed time . Jane Greer is the sizzling femme fatale who has his number . And Kirk Douglas appears in an early performance as a cold-blooded crime boss . What else can I say about the movie other than it's virtually flawless . Stark , moody cinematography ; haunting score ; terrific , sharp dialogue . This is one of the most quotable films ever . A don't miss .
573971	4532636	43014	10.0	One of the Few Perfect Movies in Existence	On the one hand , it seems pointless to add yet one more comment to the numerous comments already here testifying to the greatness of this film , but I love this movie so much that it seems just wrong to not have it included in my index of reviews . There are only a few movies I've seen that I would be tempted to label perfect . " Bonnie and Clyde " is one . " Taxi Driver " is another . These films are unimprovable as far as I'm concerned . Add " Sunset Boulevard " to that list . " Boulevard " represents Billy Wilder at his most acidic and ghoulish , but it's a testament to his genius as a film maker that he could create a film as relentlessly bleak and cynical as this one and make it devilishly entertaining ( and even quite funny at times ) rather than unbearably depressing . There's a big fat heart at the center of Wilder's bitter pill , and it's one that could be easily missed amid the dark , film-noirish exterior . I think that ultimately " Sunset Boulevard " is about the love of movies . You can tell that Wilder loves movies as much as the sad and decaying film star Norma Desmond , played brilliantly ( and I don't toss that word around lightly ) by Gloria Swanson . But he understands with an insider's point of view that there's a seedy underside to every business , and that's what he sets out to expose in his film . Movies get made and stars are born , but for every birth there's a death . I don't know how much of Swanson's performance is acting or her just being herself . If you allow yourself to think about it too long , Wilder's use of her is almost cruel , as making fun of Norma Desmond the character nearly amounts to making fun of Swanson the actress . The whole movie is uncomfortable in that same way - - it's like a bunch of Hollywood used-to-be's got together and decided to let themselves be parodied for a greater cause . But the film stops just short of cruelty , because in many ways Norma is the most sympathetic character in the film , and every so often there's a glimpse of the vulnerable human being underneath that ridiculous getup that begs to be loved , and who can't relate to that ? William Holden is perfect in a non-showy role that it would be tempting to pass off as an easy one . But I don't think it is an easy role . Holden has to be responsible for tempering the audience's reaction to Norma - - he's the moral conscience of the film , and his steady presence anchors it and keeps it from sailing headlong into camp . There are so many quotable lines in this film , I don't know where to begin . Imagine this film and " All About Eve " coming out in the same year . It's a movie quote fan's wet dream . In an eerie bit of prophetic trivia , apparently Gloria Swanson thought this film would signal such a major comeback for her that she began plans to write a stage musical based on the film , starring herself . ( She might even have gotten as far as completing it ) . Of course nothing ever came of it , and Swanson sunk quickly back into obscurity . But she would be vindicated to know that a stage musical did eventually appear , courtesy of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber , and it actually does quite a bit of justice to Wilder's film .
574203	4532636	60665	10.0	Perhaps the Best Costume Drama Ever Made	" A Man for All Seasons " is that rare treasure : a costume drama that actually feels alive and lived in , rather than like a meticulously detailed museum exhibit . Paul Scofield plays Sir Thomas More with tremendous dignity and without an ounce of actorly self-consciousness . Never once will you catch him Acting with a capital " A . " He immerses himself utterly in the character , and creates a wholly believable portrait of a man facing a profound , and potentially fatal , moral crisis . Wendy Hiller does serviceable work in the role of noble suffering wife , and Robert Shaw adds another to the long list of performances that depict Henry VIII as a loud , crass , obnoxious boor ( though in fairness , perhaps there isn't any other way to play Henry VIII ) . A very young Susannah York appears as well , as Thomas More's daughter . Director Fred Zinnemann takes a no-fuss approach to the material , and directs with a minimum of frills so as not to detract from the strength of the writing and acting . However , the directing style doesn't feel anonymous , and one senses that Zinnemann is in total control at all times . Everyone knows how the story ends , so the movie by default is a bit of a bummer , but it's still a bracing and exhilarating film nonetheless , and the depressing ending is offset by the thrill of seeing a story about a man who stands up for what he believes in presented in an intelligent way without a bunch of phony Hollywood hooey .
573680	4532636	73440	10.0	My Pick for Best Film of the 1970s	" Nashville " is a whirling dervish of a movie that comes blaring out at you from the first moment of its opening credits and never really lets up . Like much of Robert Altman's best work , it's not necessarily about any one thing , but is rather about a bunch of little things . It's a film that is as much about a general spirit as it is a grand theme - - its anarchic tone manages to convey both what is best and worst about American culture . " Nashville " is so in tune with its time , and it feels so immediate , that it's been forgotten today , when other much more " manufactured " films from the time are fondly remembered . It's somewhat understandable - - it's an ugly film , though in this particular case I mean that as a compliment . The actors in it don't look like actors , and Altman incorporates real locations and real Nashvillians ( ? ) into his film in all their unattractive 1975 glory . The sets don't look dressed , the costumes are hideous , all of the interiors look like they're illuminated by unforgiving fluorescent lights and the exteriors exude humidity and sweat . Watching this film is like flipping through a family photo album and making fun of the leisure suits and awful hairstyles . But " Nashville " is one of the most consistently relevant films to have emerged from the 1970s , and I wish people would rediscover it . As the mysterious Hal Philip Walker , who provides the film with its running commentary , might say , " When more people vote for ' American Idol ' than in the latest presidential election , that's politics . " Our obsession with fame and celebrity seems only to increase , and , perhaps because of the sheer pervasiveness of our media , Americans seem less able than ever before to think critically about information and images being presented to them . Kenny , the assassin in the film who shoots Barbara Jean at the finale , seems to be attaching meaning to her that she doesn't warrant ; right before shooting her , he looks from her to a giant American flag behind her , back to her . He seems to be making some connection ; the way the shots are edited asks asks us to make connections too . What exactly does Barbara Jean stand for ? What does the American flag stand for ? Barbara Jean isn't a politician , but she has almost the same amount of influence , maybe more , over her followers . Under what obligations does this put her , if any ? I half way suspect that if Oprah Winfrey ran for President today , she could win . So is Oprah an entertainer , a politician , or some strange hybrid of the two ? Altman has never been interested in answering questions , only asking them . One of the best things about " Nashville " is its ambiguity . It " feels " American , but I can't put my finger on exactly why . Maybe because it's confusing and at times infuriating and at other times beautiful , sometimes sad , sometimes hilarious , but always glorious .
573843	4532636	469494	10.0	The Only American Masterpiece of 2007	Once in a very rare while ( all too rarely , alas ) I leave a film instantly convinced that I just experienced an enduring classic in real time , and that's how I felt after watching " There Will Be Blood . " It is an amazing film with a performance at its center that defies description , and I haven't been as energized or excited over a new release since last year's " Children of Men . " I've always liked Paul Thomas Anderson , even at his most over indulgent ( " Magnolia " ) , but he's never seemed as mature a filmmaker as he does here . Where other Anderson films have sustained one long fevered pitch and burnt themselves out in exhaustion , this film is restrained and disciplined ; it builds slowly and inexorably to a powerhouse conclusion . Like nearly every Anderson film , it's a love it or hate it movie . It's virtually impossible to have an indifferent reaction to it . And I imagine the ending will be one of the most divisive aspects of the film . I , for one , thought it ended perfectly , and suspect it will be a long time before I get the film's final image and line out of my head . No review of this film is complete without mentioning Daniel Day-Lewis , who is nothing less than a force of nature at its center . His performance is so good it's scary ; what he does in this film can't even be called acting . I've seen other performances this year that I greatly admired : Tommy Lee Jones in " In the Valley of Elah , " Ryan Gosling in " Lars and the Real Girl , " Viggo Mortensen in " Eastern Promises . " But Day-Lewis seems to be working in a completely different stratosphere than these others . In Daniel Plainview , the oilman who's eaten from within by greed and a lust for power , he has created a villain that's one-dimensional yet extremely complex all at the same time . Plainview should be a boring character , because he's so single minded in purpose , yet Day-Lewis makes him endlessly fascinating . And was I the only person who actually liked him a little bit ? In a world full of hypocrisy and men telling one another what they want to hear the better to take advantage , Plainview is refreshingly honest and straightforward , no matter how abominable he may be . He's like the American system of free enterprise taken to its monstrous extreme . Though set in the past , the film is one of the most relevant I've seen this year . The battle over economic and religious domination is obviously one that rages today . Religious and corporate institutions differ only in their methods - - both are driven by a lust for power and control . And to top it all off , Johnny Greenwood provides one of the most unique and sensational scores to grace a movie screen in a long time . I can't say enough good things about this movie .
573900	4532636	64429	10.0	This Ain't the W	An antidote to every phony show about high school ever shown on the WB , " High School " is another harrowing documentary from that most harrowing of documentarians , Frederick Wiseman . Once again , Wiseman lets his cameras roll and leaves it to the viewer to draw conclusions . But don't be surprised if the conclusion you draw is that this particular high school is a fascist , Orwellian hell for its students , where the faculty are dictators and the attendees their cowering subjects . No other moment in the film nails that point home more than the one in which a bullying principal needlessly humiliates a student . My high school experience wasn't like this , but regardless , this movie didn't make me want to revisit my high school years anytime soon .
574165	4532636	48261	10.0	Noir for a Nuclear Age	Sleazy , tawdry B-noir doesn't get any sleazier or tawdrier than Robert Aldrich's jazzy and astonishingly entertaining " Kiss Me Deadly . " This film was released late in the life cycle of the film noir genre . By 1958 and Orson Welles ' " Touch of Evil , " true noir would be just about washed up . Any noir film from that point forward would be self-consciously aware that it was tipping its hat to an established genre . But " Deadly " came out when films still didn't have to work at being noirish - - - they just WERE , and dazzlingly so . Born-to-play-a-bully Ralph Meeker plays tough-guy detective Mike Hammer , who's in the wrong place at the wrong time and picks up a mysterious panic-stricken girl ( Cloris Leachman ) , who's just escaped from an asylum . From that moment forward , he finds himself tangled up in a barely lucid plot , in which a bunch of baddies want to get their hands on something the girl either had or knew about . Hammer doesn't know what it is , but he knows that if so many people want it , it's something he probably wants too , and the race for the great " whatsit " is on . If you wanted to teach a film class about the look and attitude of a film noir , you couldn't pick a better film than this one . I found myself on a recent viewing of this film pausing my DVD player and studying the frame ( because , sadly , this is what I do in my spare time ) , rehearsing in my mind what I would tell a class about any particular composition . And aside from the style , the film is steeped in noir sentiment - - it's not simply cynical , like the glossier studio noirs of the 40's ; it's downright apocryphal . It's not simply one man undone by the vengeful forces of fate here , but an entire civilization on the brink of extinction . So pop this in and have a great time with it - - feel free to quote it liberally , as there are plenty of juicy lines worth quoting . But as you watch it , you might want to stay away from the windows , for as Mike Hammer's hot-to-trot sometime girlfriend , sometime secretary Velda says , someone may " blow you a kiss . "
574482	4532636	17136	10.0	For People Who Don't Like Silent Films	For people who think silent films are antiquated , slow , boring ( pick your adjective ) , I ask you to watch " Metropolis " and see if your opinion changes . I think too many people think of the really creaky silent films from cinema's beginnings - - like " The Great Train Robbery " or those first experimental films by George Melies - - when they think of silent film . But remember that " Metropolis " came out in 1927 , the year the industry transitioned to sound ; so really , the only thing separating this movie from some of the most beloved films of the early thirties is the absence of sound . In every other way , technologically speaking , it's just as polished . As for the movie itself , it had me on the edge of my seat . Come on , I defy anyone to not get excited by this classic underdog story ; I'm a sucker for any story where the downtrodden working man revolts against the tyranny of the rich . It's difficult to discuss acting in silent films - - I'll grant dissenters that - - because there's such a different set of standards for it than we're used to . And this movie is as guilty as any other silent film of having melodramatic trappings . But rather than dwell on those criticisms , accept them as part of the experience and enjoy the movie for what it is . And what is it ? It's the granddaddy of every sci-fi movie ever made since . There's hardly a sci-fi film I can think of that doesn't in some way conjure up images from this movie . " Blade Runner " and " Dark City " borrowed its production design ; " Dr . Strangelove " took the crazed scientist with the black-gloved fist and made him a starring character ; " Star Wars " used the android as a prototype for C-3PO . " Metropolis " is a parade of iconic images , offering one memorable set piece after another . I quite literally couldn't find a flaw with it . And one last thing : the DVD version I saw had a magnificent musical score that added immensely to the effect of the movie . It's one of the best scores I've ever heard in a film .
573466	4532636	383028	10.0	One of the Most Deeply Affecting Movies I've Seen in a Long Time	It's virtually impossible to summarize my feelings on " Synecdoche , New York . " This astonishing brain teaser from the mind of Charlie Kaufman affected me deeply , probably more than any film I've yet seen this year . I can't say it's necessarily enjoyable , because it's full of uncomfortable , brave truths about what it means to be human , and it goes places most movies don't dare to . But watching it is a bracing experience , and it's encouraging to know that there are still filmmakers willing to use film as a means of challenging their audiences and picking at scabs that most people would prefer to remain solidly in place . I can't begin to tell you what " Synecdoche , New York " means , and it wouldn't matter anyway , because I think it will mean different things to different people . A basic summary goes something like this : Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a morose , depressed theatre director who's convinced that fatal diseases are lurking around every blood vessel , and who decides to stage a monstrous , ambitious theatrical work that will leave him remembered after he dies . Soon , the work as he's staging it becomes confused with the life he's living , so that he finds himself directing a version of himself through a story that seems to be made up as it moves along . If this sounds like an act of mental masturbation by a pretentious intellectual with too much time on his hands , rest assured : " Synecdoche , New York " is not one of THOSE films . I didn't become impatient with Kaufman or his characters , like I have with some of his previous projects . In fact , this film made me uneasy because of how much of it I DID relate to . The conclusions it draws are that we are all alone in this big universe , life doesn't necessarily have any meaning other than what one brings to it , and there is not a higher power who is going to make sure our passage through the world makes sense . It was a bit of a wake up call to hear these beliefs , beliefs that I happen to share , stated so boldly , for while I'm confident in what I believe , that confidence doesn't make the beliefs themselves any less scary . But depressing and nihilistic as those beliefs might sound , the film is life affirming in its own way . It suggests that too many of us spend too much time trying to make sense of the world and not enough time living in it . We pull back in loneliness and fear when faced with things bigger than ourselves rather than turning to those who can actually help , namely the other human beings with whom we share our time on this planet . " Synecdoche , New York " will not likely find a big audience , as most people will either not want to work at understanding it or won't like what it has to say . But if you're willing to go into it with an open mind , you might just find yourself amazed .
