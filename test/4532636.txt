573367	4532636	147612	1.0	Gives a Bad Name to Independent Cinema	" Happiness " is a film that has nothing to say to me , as it's about a version of America I don't recognize and have never seen . Director Todd Solondz , whose style and choice of subject matter could best be described as repellent , seems to think all Americans are living miserable , fractured lives and anyone who's not is lying about it . This is an ugly film filled with ugly characters doing ugly things , that ultimately has very little to say . Solondz may have fancied himself a new and daring artist at the time of this film's release , but showing a cum shot on film does not a groundbreaking or profound movie make . Todd Solondz belongs to a small group of filmmakers ( Lars von Trier is another ) who primarily want to use cinema as a device to drive people away , making one wonder why they want to make movies at all . I hate this movie .
573547	4532636	73540	1.0	Pretentious and Dull - - The Worst Combination	Ugh . . . an endless and interminable movie about a batch of oppressed school girls who go missing during a picnic at the eponymous rock formation . There seem to be plenty of viewers armed with psycho-babble to defend this film's deeper meaning , its undertones of sexuality , power , repression , etc . , etc . , blah , blah , blah . Whatever . I'm sure director Peter Weir knew what point he was trying to make , but this movie is a monotonous , droning bore , and I was left with no incentive to make sense of it . On top of all of that , it's also unforgivably pretentious , proof that Weir is better off sticking to the mainstream fare that has made him famous ( " Dead Poets Society , " " Witness , " " Master and Commander " ) and leave the art film to others .
574077	4532636	85959	2.0	Downright Painful	Believe me , I did not want to dislike this movie , but ultimately I thought it was just awful . They Pythoners show none of the comedic dexterity on display in " The Holy Grail " or " Life of Brian , " and this movie put me sadly in mind of the worst " SNL " skits , when one lame joke is drawn agonizingly out over a 10 or 15 minute skit . " The Meaning of Life " is much edgier in subject matter than its predecessors , but so what ? Making something edgier does not inherently make it funnier . I have to believe the high rating this film received at IMDb is a tribute more to all of the love out there for Monty Python and not for this film in particular . A movie that may cause you to crack the barest of smiles once or twice , if it's lucky .
573401	4532636	56937	2.0	In the Running for Most Boring Movie Ever Made	I can't imagine this gargantuan historical epic being of interest to anyone . As a serious piece of film , it's far too wooden and dull to appeal to cinephiles ; but for the same reasons , it doesn't even satisfy those looking for trashy camp . In terms of its physical production , " Cleopatra " takes the " more is better " approach , and stuffs every frame with gawdy set and costume details . Everything about the film is enormous ; as a result , all of the actors are buried beneath a hopeless pile of Technicolor . Everyone walks around delivering stiff speeches , but no one really develops a character . The only person who manages to infuse the film with some life is Rex Harrison , so his departure from the film at the half-way point ( with 2 + hours still to go ! ) is utterly demoralizing . The film grinds to a slower and slower pace as the remainder progresses , like an unwound music box , until by the end you can almost literally hear the DVD player laboring to spin the DVD around . This stinker landed with a huge thud at the time of its release , and it lands with a thud now . No amount of perspective can save it .
573860	4532636	76451	2.0	Start Spreading the News , This Movie Is Crap	Martin Scorsese's deconstruction of the golden Hollywood musical is a meandering disaster . " New York , New York " is damn near unwatchable . It tells the VERY slight story of a jackass saxophone player ( Robert De Niro ) who falls in love with a nightclub singer ( Liza Minelli ) and proceeds to emotionally abuse her until her life is miserable . De Niro is consistently one note in his performance , creating a character without a single redeeming feature . In his early scenes , I think we're supposed to be charmed by him , and by extension understand why Minelli's character would fall for him in the first place - - unfortunately , he comes across more as a creepy sociopath than anything , Travis Bickle with some musical talent . Minelli's role is utterly thankless , but she's absolutely the only thing that kept me watching . The last 40 minutes of the film is practically a Liza Minelli concert . Her character has vaulted to film stardom and left her loser husband in the dust ; Scorsese devotes what feels like half an hour to a movie within a movie featuring Minelli in one of those epic ballet scenes that always derailed Gene Kelly musicals . It does the same to this film , but the diversion was welcome , since it meant we could enjoy a nice break from De Niro . The movie grinds on for 163 ( ! ) minutes . At the 120 minute mark I wanted to cry . At the 150 minute mark I was beaten into submission by indifference . By that point , the film had been going on for far too long , yet at the same time I couldn't believe it would be ending in 10 minutes because it didn't seem to be moving toward any kind of resolution . Scorsese seemed to be unaware that this story had already been told - - maybe he'd never heard of " A Star Is Born . " More likely , he was paying homage to that film , but he created something that on its own terms has no reason for existence .
573617	4532636	286716	2.0	The Horror , the Horror . . . .	I so wanted to give this film a better review , because if nothing else , " Hulk " at least takes a more interesting than average approach to the comic - book - turned - into - summer - blockbuster genre . Ang Lee gets kudos from me for his use of split screens to suggest the panels of a comic book , but that's about where my praise ends . Because I usually like Lee , I'm giving this two stars instead of one , but I'm doing that under duress . " Hulk " is dreadful . It's 140 minutes of nonsense , which might be o . k . if that nonsense had any notion that it was nonsense . But Lee and company seem to take their material utterly seriously , which is deadly for this kind of film . Lee uses the comic book look for his film , but he doesn't use the comic book tongue-in-cheek style of story-telling , so every single scene comes across as unintentionally silly . Even with that , the film might have been enjoyable . Hey , I enjoy a fun bad movie as much as the next guy . But this is a fun bad movie without the fun . The story takes forever to get going , and once it does it doesn't make a lot of sense anyway . I can't believe I'm saying this , but this is one case where the story overwhelms the visuals . I don't really need that much back story to the Hulk - - - what I want are cool action sequences and zingy special effects . Well , the effects in this suck . I almost have to believe the CG animation in this film was intentionally corny , otherwise the producers got seriously ripped off . The only thing I can say about the animated Hulk is that he's a better actor than Eric Bana , who plays Bruce Banner . Please don't ask this boy to act , and especially don't ask him to cry . Jennifer Connelly is starting to really get on my nerves . She's stealing the market on noble suffering away from Joan Allen . But the real booby prize goes to Nick Nolte , who has driven another nail into the coffin of his career with his appearance in this . He's absolutely putrid , chewing the scenery every chance he gets in a greasy fright wig . His big showy soliloquy toward the end might have been more effective if the viewer could understand a word he says , but I doubt it . Perhaps the filmmakers should have chosen to use a CG version of Nick Nolte instead of the real thing . And darned if this movie doesn't suffer from action movie syndrome , complete with false finale and a real finale that is jaw-droppingly wretched . $100 bucks to anyone who can make sense of what happens at the end , and who can also tell me how all of the people back at the military base were able to see the big battle between the Hulk and Nick Nolte as if they were watching it on screen as we are , even though they are miles away watching nothing more than a radar screen . Bad , bad , bad . . . . .
573877	4532636	71803	2.0	Ghastly	This is a terrible movie , and I'm not even sure why it's so terrible . It's ugly , for one , with that trendy 1970s visual style that maybe seemed like a good idea at the time but which now enables one to instantly recognize a film from that time period as being a 70s product . The film retains the story and songs that made the stage version of the musical such a hit , but the songs sound lifeless on screen . But mostly , the movie sucks because of the wan performance of Lucille Ball , who you'd think would be able to make something of this larger-than-life character if anyone could . She sleepwalks through the movie like a terrified actress choking on her opening night , and the film sinks with her . Even Bea Arthur , who I bet was hilarious in the best friend role onstage , can't breathe any life into this stinker . Avoid at all costs .
573762	4532636	78504	2.0	Do NOT Ease on Down THIS Road	A colossal misfire . My theory is that every great director had to direct at least one crappy movie musical ( think about it , John Huston did " Annie , " Robert Altman did " Popeye , " etc . ) , and " The Wiz " is Sidney Lumet's dubious contribution . An all-black , motown version of " The Wizard of Oz " isn't a bad idea , but this movie's atrocious . It's ungainly , uninspired , unengaging . The only thing it has going for it is some funky art direction and costume design , but eye candy will only get you so far in a movie as bad as this . Diana Ross and Michael Jackson look and sound so much alike that I had trouble telling them apart .
573429	4532636	81353	2.0	" Quintet , " I Apologize - - THIS Is the Worst Altman Film Ever Made	Oh , Robert Altman , I love you and may you rest in peace , but DAMN did you make some bad movies . I've been re-watching Altman's entire oeuvre on DVD lately ( or at least the movies available ) and have had to seriously reconsider my ranking system . I had thought that " Quintet " was the nadir of his 1970s film career , but I had forgotten just how atrocious " A Wedding " is . But then I re-watched " Popeye " and think that there's a new serious contender . It's almost like after making " Nashville , " Altman set out to one-up himself in bad movies , and see just how much worse each could be than the one before it . ( Though I have to exclude " 3 Women " from this - - a remarkable film ) . " Popeye " is an example of what happens when Altman's rambling style goes completely wrong . The film is a shambling mess , with not much discernible plot , and it's almost the exact opposite of the cartoons on which it's based . Those were little jewels of narrative economy - - even a movie made for kids needs to be well written . Robin Williams is a riot as Popeye , and his constant muttering is easily the best thing about the movie . It's also worth watching to see Shelley Duvall in the role she was born to play , and she does it almost too well , making Olive Oyl just as annoying in human form as she was as a cartoon . The Harry Nilsson songs are terrible , and they're not really even songs . Characters occasionally walk around sing / talking , but the songs , like the film , have no structure and just sort of end . Ray Walston , as Popeye's pappy , infuses the film with some verve , but he enters the picture too late to save it . The set looks like the leftover remnants from " McCabe and Mrs . Miller " ( look for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it reference to that film in a whorehouse ) , and I think many of them were resurrected for " Waterworld . " The thing with Altman's bad movies , though , is that they're so confidently and spectacularly bad that they almost become entertaining . The ending of " Popeye " is a disaster , but it's so fascinatingly disastrous that you can't look away . That's almost more of a testament to Altman's skill as a director than any of the brilliant classics he made .
574128	4532636	329575	2.0	Use the DVD as a Coaster If You Want Your Full Money's Worth	Using your copy of " Seabiscuit " to set drinks on would be a more interesting use for it than actually playing the boring thing . Oh , what a safe , boring , dull movie this is . Gary Ross obviously went to the Ron Howard school of directing , where points are pounded home with a hammer and anvil and manipulated emotions are manufactured with assembly-line rapidity . This is the kind of movie where everyone delivers lines that sound like they should be on self-help bumper stickers ; homilies are handed out like parking tickets . And the movie doesn't end until each character gets to deliver at least one clunker , and most of them get to deliver many more . " Seabiscuit " isn't even really a bad movie - - it's an uninteresting movie , which is much worse . Even bad movies can be fascinating , but the filmmakers here aim so low at trying to please the lowest common denominator of viewer that they've put together a batch of pandering mush that has not one genuine emotion in it . Yuck . . .
574323	4532636	69404	3.0	An Unforgivably Bad Adaptation of a Great Book	I'm fine with filmmakers adapting books to the screen and doing what they need to do to make the source material cinematic . But I'm always mystified by filmmakers who adapt a book to the screen and change so much that it's nearly a completely different story . I wonder why they wanted to adapt the book in the first place if they felt that so much of it was inadequate . This is a terrible adaptation of the wonderful Graham Greene novel , that even a dynamic performance from Maggie Smith in the title role cannot save . George Cukor directs this film like it's a relic from a different decade . Yes , the main character is stodgy and stuffy but that doesn't mean the movie has to be . And by the time the ending has rolled around , all vestiges of the source material have vanished completely , an unforgivable crime in my opinion when working with an author as great as Greene .
573784	4532636	87298	4.0	If Only the Title Were True	Maybe to save themselves the embarrassment of admitting just how many of these stinkers they sunk money into , the studio dropped the " 4 " from this sequel and gave it the cryptic subtitle " The Final Chapter . " Yeah , right . Like anybody believed that , even at the time . Someone once told me that all of the even " Star Trek " movies were good and all of the odd ones were sucky . Since I've only seen two of them ( both even by the way ) , I can't comment . But that rule seems to apply to this series . Parts 1 and 3 were beyond atrocious ; parts 2 and 4 aren't that bad , as these kinds of movies go . This movie freshens up the tired formula somewhat by adding a plot strand that features Corey Feldman and continues through the next couple of films in the series . And this one has a more unique style to it . I liked the murder that took place in silhouette , a shadow thrown on to a wall during a flash of lightning . The makeup effects were also much more accomplished , and there was some catharsis in seeing Jason get his head split open with a machete ( though why does he look like a product of radioactive fallout ? Didn't he drown originally ? ) This movie will still lower your I . Q . by a few points , but you'll be able to respect yourself in the morning . ( compared to parts 1 and 3 . It's still an F compared to virtually any other movie available to you )
573896	4532636	45564	4.0	Who Knew Fritz Lang Could Make a Boring Movie ?	A mediocre pseudo-noir thriller from Fritz Lang . I watched this only a few days after seeing the 1947 film " High Wall , " and was struck by how the two films tell much the same story with genders reversed . In this one , Anne Baxter plays a phone operator who goes out with a lecherous artist ( Raymond Burr ) on an impulsive whim after being jilted by her boyfriend , a soldier stationed in Korea . On their date , Burr tries to rape her , and Baxter blacks out in the ensuing struggle , only to find out the next day that Burr was found dead in his apartment . The search is on for the " Blue Gardenia , " as the unknown murderess is dubbed , and Baxter begins to unravel under the guilt of her secret . Richard Conte plays a reporter who is desperate to crack the case , and who makes an outreach to the murderess , promising to help her if she'll only come forward . Of course Baxter does , and of course it turns out that she wasn't the murderess after all , but there's absolutely no mystery surrounding who actually did it , because the real murderer isn't a character we've already met , but rather is introduced at the very last moment simply to give the film some resolution . Lang could usually be relied upon to give us stylish , memorable movies , but this film isn't particularly stylish or memorable , and feels like it could have been directed by anybody . The romance between Conte and Baxter feels perfunctory , and it doesn't go anywhere . Ann Sothern plays Baxter's roommate , and I was at first intrigued by the fact that she and Baxter look almost exactly alike - - I thought maybe the film was going to make some comment on the interchangeability of women in the eyes of male predators , or something like that , but it doesn't . It's all very straightforward , with none of the psycho-sexual subtext that makes so many other noirs so juicy , and it's all very dull .
574454	4532636	41113	4.0	A Waste of Good Source Material	This Oscar-winning screen adaptation of the Pulitzer-Prize-winning Robert Penn Warren novel feels oddly truncated , like director Robert Rossen filmed a much longer movie , and then an unqualified editor hacked it down to the movie we see . The pacing is off , scenes feel cut short and much of it is confusing , as if there are elements missing . It doesn't come close to capturing the greatness of the novel , and it's one of the weakest films to win the Best Picture Academy Award from that time period . Broderick Crawford makes a fine Willie Stark , though , I'll give the film that . He's all bluster and hot-headed arrogance , just what the character calls for . John Ireland does fine with the role of Jack Burden , but the character itself is minimized . The book is really more about Jack than Willie , but the film doesn't give Jack much of a character arc , and he feels decidedly supporting . Mercedes McCambridge nabs the role of a lifetime playing Sadie Burke , perhaps one of the most colorful female characters ever put to paper . Here again , the movie doesn't begin to make use of her character like the book does . It uses the elements of her character that are necessary for the plot , but leaves behind everything else - - - the more human dimensions of Sadie , and her own moral crises , are lost . Overall I thought this was a tepid and forgettable movie based on a landmark and compulsively readable book . If you avoid this one entirely , you won't be missing anything .
574092	4532636	109830	4.0	The Ultimate Fad Movie	" Forrest Gump " is the ultimate fad movie . It came out big in 1994 and created a cultural sensation . It was easy to get swept up in its panorama of American cultural history , and all of the iconic imagery in the film made it seem like it was saying something important . But all these years later , this treacly piece of rubbish is nearly intolerable . The film is full of easy sentiment and false emotion . It depicts one thing after another ( the Kennedy assassination , Vietnam , Watergate , the AIDS crisis ) that trigger automatic emotional responses in the audience , so that the filmmakers don't have to do any work of their own to make the material effective . But underneath the lesson in American history and the admittedly terrific soundtrack , I can't help but wonder what point the movie tries to make . Are we to applaud Forrest for his pluck and resiliency when the only reason for them is the fact that he's too simple minded to understand the things that happen to him ? Are we supposed to emulate him ? Is the message that we all make life too complicated , and that we all need to buckle down to the only things that really matter , like love of country , God and our dear ol ' mama ? If so , gag . Tom Hanks is a winning presence in the film , and if anyone was going to be able to carry this story along , I imagine he did just as good a job as anyone else would have . But the only character worth watching as far as I'm concerned is poor little Jenny , played valiantly by Robin Wright Penn , who comes closer than anyone to playing an actual human being , despite the film's tendency to chew her character up and spit her out . This movie is like a box of chocolates . . . too much of it and you'll be sick .
574446	4532636	430357	4.0	A Joyless , Arduous Experience	With " Miami Vice , " on-again-off-again director Michael Mann gives us a grim , hateful movie , and large parts of it feel more like an endurance test than a summer entertainment . I don't care whether or not this movie accurately reimagines the original T . V . series for the screen - - I never saw the series and so have nothing to compare this film to except itself . Mann is a good enough director that no movie he directs will ever be bad without at least being interesting , and " Vice " is no exception to that rule . He does deserve credit for bringing a unique vision to a tired formula and for resisting the urge to spoon feed his audience summer blockbuster nonsense . " Miami Vice " may have many problems , but obviousness is not one of them . In fact , the film is frustratingly vague and opaque . We only know who the good guys are in this movie because they're played by actors we recognize . With a blast of techno music and a writhing female body silhouetted against pulsing neon , the movie just starts in the middle of a scene and is off and away before we know who anybody is or why we should care . This would be fine if we ever learned any more than we can glean from the film's opening few moments , but we don't . We root for Crockett and Tubbs , but only because the movie sticks with them and there's no one else to root for . The only attempt at giving them any backstory or character development comes through the women in their lives , but those parts of the movie feel obligatory , and you can feel Mann aching to get back to the good stuff ( meaning the jittery , loud stuff ) whenever the film settles into a quiet moment . The camera never stops moving , so everything rushes by in a blur of murky color and extreme close-ups ( do we need to see every individual blade of stubble on Colin Farrell's face ? ) and Mann gives the audience no anchor around which to orient itself . I only know this movie takes place largely in Miami because otherwise the title would be meaningless . At the risk of sounding like a prude , the violence in this movie really bothered me - - or more accurately , the reaction of the audience to the violence in this movie really bothered me . The movie is so relentless and humorless , no one involved seems to be having a good time , and then - - BAM - - someone gets his insides blown out against a wall , we see blood splatter , and the audience cheers . The violent moments are the only thing Mann allows us to feel anything about . The only scene in the film that remotely approaches humor involves a nasty white supremacist getting shot in the head . Sound like a good time to you ? " Miami Vice " ' s greatest offense is that it's pointless . Do we need another undercover cop story that does nothing new with the genre ? Plots to these films are always formulaic , so if you're not going to distinguish your film through your characters , what's the point of making it ? And , I don't know what critics are talking about when they say how great this film looks . The grainy , pixillated digital film may come out stellar on the DVD release , but it looks terrible on a mile-wide multiplex screen .
573718	4532636	99077	5.0	Cue Tears	A fairly maudlin film with undistinguished direction from Penny Marshall . Robert DeNiro gives an Oscar-bait performance as a catatonic man who responds briefly to the treatment of a benevolent doctor ( Robin Williams , in serious mode ) , only to sink back into his catatonic state . It's reminiscent of the short story " Flowers for Algernon " ( which by the way was made into the movie " Charly , " for which Cliff Robertson won an Oscar - - am I seeing a theme here ? ) The film tries to earn tears the cheap and easy way - - through treacly music and directorial tricks , but I didn't respond much to it .
573340	4532636	52619	5.0	Women in the Workplace , 50s Style	With the decade quickly drawing to a close , director Jean Negulesco realized that subsequent generations would likely revere " Peyton Place " as the ultimate example of 1950s camp , so he hustled this cornball movie out and ended up giving " Peyton Place " quite a run for its money . Actually , " The Best of Everything " is moderately more enjoyable than the other film , if only because it doesn't take itself quite so seriously . A group of young women working in a secretarial pool fight , scheme , fall in love , get jilted , kill themselves and put themselves through all other sorts of histrionics in this hysterical film . I wish my work place was even half as intriguing as the one here . Joan Crawford presides over all with an air of icy menace , her eyebrows arched to the high heavens , sending her latest assistant on impossible errands just for the hell of it . Meanwhile , the syrupy title song warbles on and on in that grating way that only film title songs from the 1950s can warble . Crawford , as usual , brings some dignity to the material and , also as usual , almost makes you care about a movie you know you wouldn't otherwise give a damn about . There are men in the movie - - salacious bosses , preening celebrities , square-jawed hotshots - - but frankly , all of them run together . Though now that I think of it , so do the women , except for Crawford , that tireless workhorse who pulled more than her fair share of stinkers out of the gutter .
574016	4532636	858479	5.0	A Movie About Smart Dumb People and Dumb Smart People	With a title like " Smart People , " you just know there's a lesson to be learned in this movie , and that it probably has something to do with people who think they're smarter than they are . Those people are Dennis Quaid , a tiresome boor of a college lit professor who nobody likes , and his equally tiresome and snarky daughter , played by Ellen Page as a young Republican version of Juno . These two pompous asses make snap judgements about everybody and think nobody's worth wasting the time to interact with . Of course , in both cases , the characters are making up for insecure deficiencies , brought about mostly by the death of their wife and mother . The dumb people who end up being smarter than the smart people are Thomas Haden Church , as a loaf of an adopted brother who has a fondness for laying around with his bare ass waving in the wind ; and Sarah Jessica Parker , as an emergency room doctor and former student of Quaid's who strikes up a romance with him . O . k . , so she was pretty smart to begin with , but not in the way that Quaid and Page think she should be . . . . you get the point . What does all of this add up to , you ask ? A movie that I had forgotten about as soon as I stowed away my half-eaten box of Junior Mints and began strolling toward the exit . " Smart People " isn't a bad movie , but it's an awfully inconsequential one . It doesn't add up to anything , and that's o . k . - - some of the best movies are those that don't try to change the world . But a movie needs to have SOMETHING - - either a plot or characters to care about , one or two original ideas , a fancy style . This has none of these things . The plot is lazy and has a been-there-done-that quality to it . It just sort of meanders along until it reaches a hastily-realized happy ending . Paradoxically , though there are really only four main characters , I felt like none of the actors had enough screen time to really flesh their characters out . Or more precisely , they didn't have good enough material to make use of the screen time they were given . Poor Thomas Haden Church gets the worst of this . On paper , it would appear that his brother / uncle character is important to the story , but the way it plays out , it feels like Church showed up on the set one day and everyone scrambled around to find stuff for him to do . His character doesn't feel at all integrated into the movie , even though he's the one we'd rather be spending our time with . " Smart People " feels like what it probably is : a movie about a very specific milieu that either the writer or director ( or both ) have direct and personal experience with , but that they unsuccessfully translated into a universal story that anyone could appreciate . I was on a business trip and had nothing else to do , so I was able to just go with the flow and moderately enjoy this movie , but a must-see it most certainly isn't .
573775	4532636	427969	5.0	A Rather Dull Disappointment	This slightly dreary film about the mysterious death of George Reeves , television's " Superman , " and its subsequent investigation feels like an opportunity missed to put a compelling and engaging story on the screen . The pacing is too sluggish and the ambitious screenplay too muddled for the film to ever come fully alive . It doesn't help that the central role , that of Louis Simo , the down-on-his-luck private investigator who consumes himself with Reeves ' murder in an attempt to win himself some needed publicity and fame , is woefully miscast . Adrien Brody is not at all right for the role of Simo . At one point in the film , one of his ex-colleagues makes a crack about there only being room in the world for one Ralph Meeker , an unfortunate line because it only draws attention to the fact that Brody has nowhere near the physical presence to pull off a tough-guy attitude like the one he's asked to pull off here . He's so young-looking and so slight in build that he comes across more like a scruffy high-schooler than he does a toughened and bitter detective . We see him become obsessed with the Reeves case at the expense of his personal life - - he's estranged from his wife ( I'm not sure if they are divorced or merely separated ) and his young son , and his girlfriend is cheating on him - - and he convinces himself and tries to convince everyone around him that Reeves was killed when the death was labeled by the LAPD as a suicide . Throughout the film , we see various versions of Reeves ' death played out in Simo's head as new evidence leads him down different paths toward different theories . But this investigation never picks up steam . The screenplay is torn between following Simo and his personal demons and Reeves and his . Much of the film is devoted to showing the rise and fall of Reeves ' career , and the movie can't ever decide whether it's more interested in him or Simo . In the end , I think we're supposed to feel that the two men shared something in common , and that Simo's personal downward spiral gives him a privileged peek into the mind of Reeves . He finally comes to see how the suicide angle could be true , and that , though all of the conspiracy theories he's shuffled around in his head make for better headlines , the real story might be something as simple as the hopelessness of one washed up actor . But the moment of this revelation is not clear and the connection between the two men isn't given enough focus or impact , so the audience is left holding two halves of a movie that don't completely fit together . Ben Affleck plays George Reeves and does a serviceable enough job . He gives probably the best performance in the film , thought it's not a film filled with great acting . Diane Lane plays Mrs . Mannix , wife of studio head Eddie Mannix ( Bob Hoskins ) and sugar momma to Reeves . Lane gives a mannered performance , and plays a rich pampered studio wife the way a college actress might play her . It doesn't help that the role as written flails all over the place . Hoskins makes little impression in his brief screen time . The thing I disliked most about " Hollywoodland " was the awkward blending of reality and fiction . Because certain moments take place exclusively in Simo's head , I wasn't always sure what was actually happening and what he was imagining , and in this case I didn't feel that the effect was intentional . The most egregious example of this comes during a scene when Reeves is performing for a group of children as Superman , and a small boy comes up to him with a real loaded gun and asks if he can shoot him . The way the scene is filmed and edited , it seems to be something Simo is either imagining or dreaming , but later on Reeves himself makes reference to the incident . How the situation played out , or how the little boy managed to get his hands on a loaded gun in the first place , is never explained . A disappointing film .
574207	4532636	50839	5.0	Hot and Bothered in Small-Town America	A hopelessly corny and stodgy piece of 1950s film-making that thinks racy subject matter alone makes it important . Well , it doesn't . " Peyton Place " is a static adaptation of a scandalous book , filled with a cast of females who all look the same - - as blonde and coiffed as the most stereotypical image of a 50s housewife . Of them , Hope Lange does the best with the material given her , playing a sweet kid with a lousy dad , who rapes and beats her in glorious Technicolor . Arthur Kennedy growls his way through the movie as said dad , providing it with some much-needed testosterone , even if that testosterone is somewhat misdirected . Also technically providing some male hormones to the film , though in much diluted form , is Russ Tamblyn , who plays a shy nerd smitten with the movie's narrator , played by Diane Varsi . And bringing the film its star voltage , Lana Turner delivers an imperious performance as an uptight mom , all pointy breasts and platinum blonde hair . " Peyton Place " supposedly takes place in the early 1940s , but you'd never know it from the film's production design . The clothes , hairstyles and saturated color are all pure 50s - - in fact , this movie is the kind of hokey 1950s melodrama that later films making fun of the 50s would parody .
574380	4532636	76666	5.0	Look Mr . Kotter , I Can Dance !	It would be almost impossible to believe that John Travolta received an Academy Award nomination for this movie if the Academy didn't have a long history of nominating films and performances that left us scratching our heads at what they were thinking . Actually , Travolta's not bad in this movie ; if anything , he's absolutely the only reason to watch it now , because the movie itself just isn't very good . It's got groovy music , coiffed hair and 1970s disco atmosphere dripping from every frame , but it's primarily an excuse for a bunch of flashy dance numbers without the burden of stringing them together with anything resembling a real plot . It's hokey and harmless , but I can think of a thousand other movies off of the top of my head that would be more worth your time than this .
574145	4532636	51459	5.0	Cat Has No Claws	Yet another example of a 1950s stage to screen adaptation in which the entire reason for the play's existence is removed from the screen version in order to placate the censors . Why did people even want to make movies out of plays if they wanted to remove everything that made the plays interesting in the first place ? Without the homosexual subtext , " Cat on a Hot Tin Roof " isn't about very much except Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor disliking each other until they do a complete 180 and get it on in the film's final scene . I guess at the time the pairing of two hot actors was enough to get audiences into the theatres , but that's not good enough now . This is tepid and bland , with uninspired direction , and would make anyone wonder why this Tennessee Williams play is considered to be such a classic . There is one reason to see this film , though , and that's Burl Ives . Newman and Taylor fade into the background , and the movie becomes the story of Ives ' Big Daddy , who gives a fascinating , bellicose performance as a dying patriarch , desperately in need of a worthy heir to carry on his legacy . With this and " The Big Country , " released the same year , Ives had perhaps the best 1958 of any other actor working at the time .
573307	4532636	79261	5.0	This Age of Aquarius Came About Ten Years Too Late	Hollywood ignored the fact that the cult classic musical was virtually unfilmable ( not to mention the fact that by 1979 it was already outdated ) and made it into a movie anyway . The results are predictably mixed . It's not a disaster , but it's no classic . It suffers from having a strong narrative forced on it , whereas the stage version felt organic and like it was being made up as the actors went along . The music sounds pretty good , but the whole movie has the taint of the unnecessary . Treat Williams is pretty good , and Nell Carter shows up in a cameo and knocks one out of the park with the " White Boys / Black Boys " number . Milos Forman ( of all people ) directed .
574037	4532636	811080	5.0	Not a Great Movie , But the Blu-Ray Is Astounding !	If you own a Blu-Ray player , run don't walk to rent this movie and see Blu-Ray strut its stuff . This film looks AMAZING - - it's easily one of the most dazzling visual experiences I've ever had . However , do not misinterpret that praise as a recommendation of the film itself . Though it's not the disaster critics made it out to be upon its release , " Speed Racer " isn't a very good movie . If I hadn't been utterly absorbed in its high-def awesomeness , I likely would have gotten bored pretty quickly , as would I imagine anyone who's not under the age of , say , fourteen . Emile Hirsh is a drip as the eponymous hero , and there's not really anyone else in the cast to pick up the slack , though Christina Ricci tries mighty hard with the meagre material she's given to spice things up as Speed's girlfriend . The action scenes and much of the plot are frequently incomprehensible - - one wonders if a movie based on a cartoon needs to be quite so complicated , or quite so long ( 2 + hours ) . But if dazzling visuals are enough to engage your interest ( and let's face it , sometimes they just are ) , then this one is worth the space on your Netflix queue .
573835	4532636	66601	5.0	Antonioni's Smug Indictment of American Consumerism	I've always been slightly annoyed at non-American directors who propose to understand everything that is wrong with American culture . America is far from perfect , but so is every other country in the world , and each should focus on figuring out its own problems before taking on those of another ( are you listening , George Bush ? ) . " Zabriskie Point " is Michelangelo Antonioni's would-be scathing critique of America's consumerist culture as it existed in 1970 , and like the other Antonioni films I've seen , it's more of an endurance test than anything . It's capped by an explosive ( literally ) finale , during which the female protagonist imagines all manner of consumer goods ( refrigerators , television sets , dinnerware ) , not to mention the desert home of her boss , a corporate big-wig ( played by Rod Taylor ) who's company is planning to use the wide open spaces of the California desert as development property , being blown up in fascinating slow motion , so that all of these material things become no more than abstract bits and pieces floating through space . However , to get to that memorable finale , you have to sit through the rest of the movie , during which our female protagonist and her sort-of boyfriend wander around the dunes and rocky crags of the landmark that gives the film its title . No one put boredom on the screen better than Antonioni , and almost no one was better at boring his audience to tears as a result . We learn nothing about our two young lovers , other than that they're vaguely frustrated and suffering from feelings of oppression . What they're oppressed by is never made clear , and neither of them is remotely likable . It also doesn't help that their acting is atrocious . The male of the couple is involved in some sort of local student protests , but again , we don't ever fully understand what the students are protesting against . Rod Taylor and the other corporate hot shots are meant to be evil , I guess , mostly because they wear suits and have nice haircuts . Antonioni does have a knack for filming mundane locations in such a way as to make them look like something from another planet , like a sleek office in a corporate center or an L . A . boulevard choked with billboards and used car lots . But all of his critiques come across as vague and smug . This film comes across as something made by an angry college student , who's trying to respond to issues he doesn't fully understand . Antonioni evades having to offer any answers because he never gets around to asking any real questions . I would recommend " Zabriskie Point " for the finale alone , but that's about it .
573458	4532636	38559	5.0	Hayworth's Attempt to Become More Than a Pin-Up Girl	It seems as if every beautiful actress from the 40's who skated by on looks and sex appeal had at least one bid at gaining credibility for herself as a " serious " actress - - - and " Gilda " was Rita Hayworth's . Don't get me wrong , I think Hayworth is as gorgeous as the next guy , but she's just not a great actress , nor is she an interesting screen presence . Her beauty is of that variety that looks better in stills and movie posters than it does on the screen . " Gilda " isn't an especially memorable film . There was much ballyhoo at the time about the chemistry between Hayworth and leading man Glenn Ford , and I believe the film was a tremendous box office success , but it doesn't seem very exceptional now . The most famous scene , and the one invariably selected for excerpts today , is that of Hayworth's big musical number , " Put the Blame on Mame , " but what I guess seemed sexy at the time - - Hayworth flopping around like she's attached to strings that someone else is pulling - - seems awfully limp and silly now . Not a terrible movie , but there's really nothing much to recommend about it either .
573460	4532636	24008	6.0	Is That a Gearshift in Your Pocket or Are You Just Happy to See Me ?	In " Female , " Michael Curtiz's schizophrenic 1933 nothing , the lovely Ruth Chatterton plays the president of an auto manufacturing company who has put business and power above womanly advantages ( which in this film means she'd rather be independent than be barefoot and pregnant ) . She has her way with just about every even moderately good looking man in the joint , inviting them over to her house for " dinner " and to discuss business , only to halt the shop talk mid-way through and throw a pillow suggestively on the floor while the camera discreetly fades to black . All of this changes when she meets George Brent , an engineer hired by the company who is completely immune to Chatterton's dubious charms . Once she realizes that Brent isn't buying what she's selling , she revamps her product , opting instead to act like a typical woman , which means asking Brent's help in starting fires and speaking in a high-pitched sing-song . By the end , she's decided to chuck the business and hand it over to Brent so that she can be his dutiful wife . This film is absolutely absurd , even by 1933 standards , and you'll have to sit through about 40 feminist film seminars to wash the taste of it out of your mouth , but it's rather fun to see just how backwards it can possibly be . Chatterton is a likable actress and she's got a lot of spunk . The car manufacturing setting means that the screenwriter can create all sorts of double entrendes using car part lingo , and the whole thing's only about an hour long anyway , so it breezes right by .
574437	4532636	23948	6.0	This Dinner Is Served Lukewarm	MGM , inventor of the all-star big-budget soap opera extravaganza , sought to follow up their smashing success , " Grand Hotel " ( 1932 ) , with another high-power ensemble film , and turned to this popular stage play for the material . If " Dinner at Eight " is ultimately not as satisfying as " Grand Hotel , " it's because director George Cukor does not take as cinematic an approach as Edmund Goulding . In " Grand Hotel , " the camera went sweeping around the vast interior of that film's magnificent set , and the viewer comes away from that movie remembering images as well as characters . Cukor takes a much more stagebound approach with his film , and visuals are too hampered by small and static sets . Even the actors perform as if on stage , pausing at their entrances for applause they would have received had they been performing in front of a live audience . And even though the cast is comprised of the best MGM had to offer at the time , it doesn't gel like the cast in " Grand Hotel " did . Lionel Barrymore uncharacteristically seems to be on shaky ground ; Billie Burke and her fussy performance are more distracting than funny ; and Jean Harlow and her on-again-off-again Southern accent are all wrong . One can't help but imagine what Ginger Rogers could have done with the Harlow part if only Rogers had been a big enough name when this film was released . Only Marie Dressler truly delights , so much so that whenever she isn't on screen , you fidget waiting for her to come back . As for the material itself , the play takes on some strong themes but handles them awkwardly . The set up seems to go on forever - - an hour into the film , I felt like the movie was still introducing characters and main plot threads . The ending has a hurried quality , as if the screenwriters decided they had spent all of their time on plot set up and couldn't afford any for actual resolutions . If the film is faithful to the play , the play must have been a fairly minor one . So , certainly not a bad film by any means , and worth seeing for some of the most famous names in the early ' 30s , but it doesn't surprise me that the movie hasn't had the longevity of " Grand Hotel . "
573671	4532636	167190	6.0	Great Acting , Lousy Story	How many times do you come away from an action movie ( and one based on a comic book series no less ) remembering the characterizations more than anything else ? This was the case for me in watching " Hellboy . " I was totally impressed with Ron Perlman's dry as vermouth performance , and that alone elevates this film above your standard comic book to screen adaptation . Unfortunately , the story is so uninvolving that it never puts the characters in situations that really engage the viewer , so the acting talent much of the time feels wasted . This film looks great , too , but come on , by now don't all Hollywood action films look pretty good , and shouldn't they , given the amount of money thrown at them . No , the makers of " Hellboy " have all the ingredients for a spicy , rich , delicious stew but only manage to muster up a mediocre broth that needs a lot of salt .
573885	4532636	50419	6.0	Astaire Minus Rogers Plus Hepburn	This lighthearted musical soufflé doesn't make a bit of sense , but that's part of its charm . Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn didn't at first strike me as a likely pair before I saw this film , but Astaire had so much charisma and charm that he could make the oddest pairing seem perfectly natural , and as he's dancing with whatever partner he happens to be paired with at that moment , you can't imagine him dancing with anyone else . Directors always treated Audrey Hepburn like a china doll - - they required that she move her stately way through their films with the utmost grace and poise . It's a treat , therefore , to see Stanley Donen let her have some fun , and cut loose in some jazzy dance numbers , which she handles quite well , thank you very much . Kay Thompson , as a blowzy fashion editor , provides nearly all of the comedy , blaring her way through the movie in supreme Eve Arden mode . There's nothing especially memorable about this movie , but then again it's also a harmless enough way to spend a couple of hours .
573396	4532636	69704	6.0	Movie's Appeal Is Lost on Me	Maybe I'm just not the right age to fully appreciate the nostalgic tug of this film , but I've never warmed to the charms of " American Graffiti . " I usually like movies with loose , improvisational styles , which " Graffiti " certainly has . But here it feels more like pointless meandering than it does hip improvisation . The film stars a number of actors whose faces would become familiar but who were as yet unknown : Ron Howard , Richard Dreyfuss , Harrison Ford , Cindy Williams , and notably Mackenzie Phillips , who gives the funniest and most outrageous performance of the group . Fans of 1960s music and hot rods will also get a kick out of the soundtrack and the souped up cars these kids cruise around in , whiling away the hours before life - - and particularly the Vietnam War - - takes them in separate directions . Many lament the fact that George Lucas went on to make the " Star Wars " series when he could have instead made more films like this . I don't know . I for one enjoyed " Star Wars " a hell of a lot more .
573984	4532636	416449	6.0	Gird Your Loins , Men !	It's amazing to me that " 300 " is being taken seriously enough to stir up so much controversy . Some say it's homoerotic , others that it's homophobic . Some say it's an indictment of the Bush Administration's attitudes about war , others that it's a right-wing , pro-war diatribe . Iranians are apparently offended by the portrayal of Persians in the film . There are at least three reasons that all of these people need to chill out about this movie : 1 . ) It's based on a graphic novel , and when was the last time we expected subtlety , realism or political correctness from a graphic novel ? 2 . ) Since it's a virtual recreation of a previously existing graphic novel , the blame for its offensiveness should rest on Frank Miller , not the film . 3 . ) The movie isn't nearly intelligent enough or important enough to be offended by . " 300 " is one long , witless , sustained shout of a movie . Sadly , the filmmakers take their purpose very seriously , so this has none of the knowing humour or kitsch value of " Sin City , " the 2005 masterpiece that also recreated a Frank Miller world on the big screen . The creators of " 300 " seem to think they have an important story to tell , and they tell it with deadly earnestness . Therefore , every single line of dialogue , every gesture , every sound effect , is pitched at the same over-emphatic level , with the results being a poundingly monotonous movie . After all the talk of the striking visual style , " 300 " ended up not being stylized enough for my taste . " Sin City " truly created a whole other world on screen ; realism was not only ignored - - it was completely shunned . In " 300 , " the artists try to create a realistic universe for their characters to move and fight in , so what we basically get in the end is an imitation of films like " Gladiator " and " Troy , " with even less brains . Not surprisingly , the movie is at its best when it's fighting . There are a couple of dazzling sequences , like the one in which our feisty band of Spartans sends a horde of Persians hurtling over a cliff ; or a montage that shows an extended series of battles including charging rhinos and elephants . But any time it slows down for plot exposition or scenes of dialogue , you might as well hit snooze , because you're not going to miss anything important . None of the actors really makes much impression , though they probably deserve credit for even doing as well as they do , considering they had nothing but blue screens to interact with . Gerard Butler is o . k . as King Leonidas , but his mush-mouthed line delivery was a constant distraction . Rodrigo Santoro gets stuck with a humiliating role as Xerxes , king of the Persians . The costume designer bedecks him in jewels and piercings , and the sound team give him an electronically fake voice that sounds ridiculous coming from such a fruit loop of a character . But no matter . The only thing you really notice about any of the actors are their sculpted abs and pecs , which are on constant and prominent display . Indeed , by the end of the film , I was identifying the characters by their torsos rather than by any distinguishing personality traits , since there aren't any . I was in the mood for a film like " 300 " and wanted desperately to like it , but it wore me down . Now I know how those Persians must have felt .
573489	4532636	387514	6.0	Not Bad But Not Especially Compelling Either	Midway through " Prime , " there's a scene in which Uma Thurman's character , Rafi , comes to her boyfriend's ( Bryan Greenberg ) house for dinner with his family . His mom , played by Meryl Streep , as usual giving a performance better than the movie it's in , has up until very recently been Rafi's therapist . The women must now navigate very tricky terrain . A relationship that had been maternal in one way has now become maternal in a very different way . The therapist loves Rafi and thinks she's a wonderful person , but she also knows much about her that prospective mothers-in-law don't necessarily know about their sons ' girlfriends , things that compound the problems raised by Rafi's not only being 14 years older than the son , but also decidedly NOT Jewish . I wish more of " Prime " had been about this relationship , the one between Thurman and Streep . As it is , the movie feels like it has two separate halves that the young director / writer Ben Younger doesn't successfully bring together into a comprehensive whole . The rest of the film follows Rafi and her boyfriend as they try to build a relationship despite the age difference . Nothing about this half of the movie is new or fresh , and Younger never convinced me why I should care . I was too distracted by the fact that he had a wonderful actress like Streep in his film and didn't seem to know what to do with her . " Prime " is far from a bad film , and given its indifferent reception when it was released in theatres , I actually expected it to be worse than it was . But it is a rather half-baked film , and not one you need to spend a lot of mental energy on , which in this case is a criticism , because it raises a lot of interesting ideas that it never explores .
574442	4532636	48673	6.0	Not Much to This David Lean Travelogue Film	One of the many " spinster " roles Katharine Hepburn played throughout the 1950s , and one of the best . She plays a woman on vacation by herself in Venice , too uptight to let her hair down and succumb to the romance of the environment , yet tired of spending her evenings alone . She succeeds in doing a lot with a nothing role , and earned her sixth Academy Award nomination for her efforts . Beyond Hepburn , there's not a whole lot to this film . It consists mostly of scenes in which Hepburn and Rosanno Brazzi , as an Italian paramour , make tentative gestures toward one another . David Lean provides solid if uninspired direction . The movie looks nice - - Venice especially looks beautiful , and really what's going on in the background almost always holds more interest than anything going on in the foreground - - but one wishes they had splurged on CinemaScope . Subsequent Lean films would not have this problem - - he was about to embark upon his transition to massive epics that would keep him busy for the next thirty years .
574349	4532636	467200	6.0	Where Were My Heaving Bosoms ?	I was expecting heaving bosoms and bodice rippings galore from this costume drama , but sadly , the filmmakers and actors decide to take this piece of " historical " fiction seriously , and so " The Other Boleyn Girl " is not nearly as fun as it could have been . Either Natalie Portman , as Anne , or Scarlett Johansson , as Mary , is the " other " girl of the title , depending on your point of view . Both are paraded before King Henry VIII ( Eric Bana - - yeah right ! ) in an attempt to make one or the other his mistress and so establish the Boleyn family firmly in the king's favor . It's a vaguely feminist story - - the girls ' uncle and father pull the strings , while their mother ( Kristen Scott Thomas , underused ) stands in the background looking disapproving . But first and foremost , the film is a gussied up bit of Masterpiece Theatre starring beautiful Hollywood actors . The film is entertaining , but never fully engaging . For me , this was largely due to the casting . Natalie Portman is directed to play Anne Boleyn like a scheming villainess one moment , and a nobly suffering wife the next . The performance is uneven and unconvincing , and I'm not sure if the fault lies with Portman as an actress , the way the part is written , or the way she's directed to play it . Eric Bana does not have the physical presence or spirit to play Henry VIII , though the ladies in the audience should be happy , because the only bosoms to be seen in the movie belong to him . Let's just say that if Henry VIII had looked like Eric Bana , history might have turned out differently . The only actress who I felt truly did service to her role is Scarlett Johansson . Johansson gets a bad rap from people for some reason , but every time I see her in something , I'm impressed by how much I like her . I think she's a good actress who doesn't coast on her looks ( like she certainly could ) , and I wonder how this film would have come across if she and Portman had switched roles . Fans of elaborate costumes and production design should have fun with this movie .
573712	4532636	88680	6.0	An Uneasy Scorsese Experiment	I tried very hard to like " After Hours , " Martin Scorsese's surrealist head trip about a straight-laced word processor ( Griffin Dunne ) who ventures off into the SoHo night and gets trapped inside a frustrating nightmare . It's an interesting premise for a film - - what goes on out there in the nocturnal world while the rest of us are fast asleep ? But I couldn't help but feel that the film was trying too hard , like its creators were intentionally setting out to make something that would eventually end up as a cult classic . That it did doesn't make the movie any better . The best cult classics are those that become so naturally , not those that are manufactured to be so . Griffin Dunne is on screen nearly constantly , and he does well with his role , gradually working himself up to a nearly hysterical pitch of frustration in his failed attempts to get back to the safety of his home . The supporting cast is peopled with recognizable faces in cameos : Teri Garr , Catherine O'Hara , Cheech Marin , Rosanna Arquette . But no one is really playing a character , and no one really gets much to work with . I wasn't bothered by the implausibility of the film ; implausibility is the film's point . But I did get somewhat bored by the arbitrary plot twists , and the fact that I couldn't connect with anyone in the film , not even Dunne , whose character is vaguely unlikable . I did like the film's ending , though . It nicely captures that feeling of waking from an unsettling dream into the familiar world that you know and recognize .
573994	4532636	29284	6.0	The Truth Is This Grant / Dunne Vehicle Is No " Awful Truth "	This romantic screwball comedy tries to recapture the zany chemistry shared between Cary Grant and Irene Dunne in " The Awful Truth , " but the final product falls somewhat flat . Something's just missing this time around , and it's a shame , because the story has serious screwball potential . Dunne plays Grant's supposedly dead wife , who shows up alive just after Grant has remarried . The rest of the movie is about Grant promising to tell his new wife ( Gail Patrick ) about his old one and finding ways out of it , and then getting jealous when the man ( Randolph Scott ) who shared seven years with Dunne on a deserted island when they both were supposed to be dead reenters the picture and threatens to steal Dunne away . The premise is dynamite , but the humour feels somewhat strained and many of the jokes fall flat . It doesn't help that Grant's character is a bit of a weenie , and the new wife , who we're supposed to think is a bitch but whom the film never establishes as such , comes across as a victim , which makes Grant's and Dunne's antics feel more mean than funny . There is a memorable conclusion though that finds Dunne in bed and Grant dressed as Santa Claus .
574027	4532636	489281	6.0	Another Forgettable Entry in the Iraq War Movie Mill	Kimberly Peirce becomes one of the latest directors to try and only marginally succeed in making a compelling film about the Iraq conflict . Peirce takes on as her subject the military's stop-loss clause , essentially a back door draft by which the military can use fine print in recruits ' contracts to prevent them from getting out once their time is up . Peirce obviously feels strongly about the policy , but what should be a hard-hitting drama feels instead like a rather preachy after-school special . She coaxes a nice performance out of Ryan Phillipe , as the soldier who goes AWOL when his stop-loss clause is activated , but she doesn't fare as well with the rest of the cast . The film suffers from confusing editing , that doesn't always make it clear where characters are or how events are related to one another , and the writing at times is weak as well , with character motivations not coming across as clearly as they should . I don't know what it is about the Iraq conflict that makes it so hard for filmmakers to make good movies about it . Maybe it will have to be over for a while before anyone can begin to approach it with any success .
573499	4532636	499448	7.0	" Prince Caspian " Lands with a Slight Thud	This disappointing follow up to " The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe " had the unfortunate disadvantage of being based on a book that just doesn't tell as good a story as its predecessor , but even with that it could have been a better movie . I liked the intensity Andrew Adamson brought to the previous Narnia story , and I thought it nicely matched the tone of the book . Though " The Chronicles of Narnia " series was written for children , they were dark and adult in their themes ; they were about kids who were being forced to deal with adult complexities before they themselves were of an adult age . However , in this second installment , Adamson ratchets up the intensity a bit too much . The result is a movie that thunders and pounds along when it should be bewitching us with its fantasy . There's a feeling of sameness to the whole movie - - with the exception of a couple of excellently executed moments ( the appearance of Reepicheep , for example , or the initial infiltration of King Miraz's castle ) , there are few images I remember . I don't remember the book " Prince Caspian " that well , so I'm not sure how closely the film adheres to it . I know it gets the basics right . But I don't remember the book spending quite so much time with the evil Telmarines and their political intrigues . I think the back story of Prince Caspian is told as one long flashback , with the rest of the narrative sticking closely to the four Pevensie children and the Narnians . Here , Adamson moves back and forth between the stories , I guess under the impression that this approach works better cinematically ; but because of this , the film never takes focus . Is this the continuing story of Peter , Susan , Edmund and Lucy ? Is this movie about Prince Caspian ? Is this movie about the Narnians ? Edmund is practically nonexistent ; the actor who portrays Peter isn't likable enough to root for ; again , it falls to little Georgie Henley as Lucy to carry the film , and she does so ably . " Prince Caspian " is well put together , no doubt . Adamson knows how to make an action film . But the story loses some of its magic and its steam in this installment . Let's hope that the next two films ( if they get made ) , which are based on two of the strongest installments in the series , get both that magic and that steam back .
573412	4532636	405422	7.0	Funny But Overrated	There are many humorous moments in this film , and kudos to the creators of it for making an adult movie for adults , but I think the praise heaped on it has made it out to be a much better movie than it is . Given the desultory crop of summer movies we've been subjected to in 2005 , it's no wonder that a film that's even remotely original and fresh gets critics frothing at the mouth . This film suffers from what so many screen comedies do : some jokes and scenes just fall flat , and when they do , the whole pace of the movie is thrown off . It's not riotously funny , but there's enough to keep you chuckling through the dead parts . Probably not the stuff of a comedy classic , but there are worse ways to pass the time .
573580	4532636	433416	7.0	Admirable , But Suffers the Fate of Book to Screen Translations	" The Namesake " is an admirable film , and it offers an interesting glimpse into Indian culture , but it feels too much like what it is - - an adaptation from a novel . I haven't even read the book version , but even I could tell that the movie was racing to touch on all the major plot points , and sacrificing along the way all the nuances and subtleties that I have no doubt were in the written version . The film tells the story of the only son of an immigrant Indian couple who grows up American and doesn't learn to appreciate his heritage until a momentous life event teaches him a valuable lesson . In the hands of Mira Nair , who has made some lovely films ( " Monsoon Wedding " ) , it's a never less than sensitive and thoughtful movie , but by the film's end , I felt that everyone was racing through the plot in order to squeeze everything in , as if they knew they were running out of time and wanted to hit all the high notes . I also think the movie would have benefited from a less linear approach to its narrative . It's broken into roughly two halves , one showing the immigrant experience of the parents and the other the upbringing of the son . But blending the two stories more fluidly together would have had a greater cinematic impact , regardless of how it was told in the novel . One thing this movie definitely has in its favor , though , is the beautiful Indian actress Tabu , who gives a wonderful performance as Ashima , the mother who endures through hardship and anchors the film . She's the heart and soul of the movie , and imbues it with a tremendous amount of warmth .
574453	4532636	41716	7.0	Sailors on the Prowl	An energetic and fun screen adaptation of the Broadway musical , outfitted in the grand MGM style . This acts as a kind of bridge in the career of Gene Kelly between his lightweight emerging efforts of the early to mid-40's ( " Anchors Aweigh , " " Cover Girl " ) and the artistic dance spectaculars he's most known for now ( " An American in Paris , " " Singing ' in the Rain " ) . " On the Town " is better than " American " but not as good as " Singin ' . " It feels more structured than many musical offerings of the era , maybe because it's based on source material rather than an original story . The dance and songs feel more integrated into the plot , a la a stage musical , rather than just there to dazzle . And there's a fantastic score by Leonard Bernstein to help things along . Kelly is ably abetted by Frank Sinatra and the ever-intriguing Vera-Ellen as Miss Turnstiles - - - she in particular is one of the most amazing dancers I've ever seen on screen , and it's a shame she didn't do more .
574279	4532636	43459	7.0	Earnest WWII Drama Falls Just Short	A WWII yarn about a German prisoner ( Oskar Werner ) who volunteers himself for spy work in the front lines during the waning days of the European conflict . He's sent off on a mission that also involves another German spy and an American radio man ( Richard Basehart ) . While carrying it out , he suffers a crisis of conscience , torn between his allegiance to his home country and his belief that the best way to help his people is to help the Americans wipe out Hitler's regime . " Decision Before Dawn " is an entertaining spy thriller that benefits from its authentic , on location shooting amid bombed out European villages . But it could have been a much more interesting film had its moral conflicts been given more air time . It then would have been like something from Graham Greene . Unfortunately , Werner's crisis isn't shown to us as much as it's told to us in a few moments of voice over . Werner himself gives a good performance with the material he's given to work with , but it's tough to shake off the feeling of missed opportunity that surrounds the role . Speaking of Graham Greene , the film's finale is a chase through the rubble of a German town , and it's reminiscent of " The Third Man , " but this one feels slightly dogged when compared to that other film's sense of funhouse excitement . Also starring Gary Merrill as the leader of the American mission , and Hildegard Knef in a brief but memorable role as a possible romantic complication for Werner .
573997	4532636	93773	7.0	An Oddly Appealing Sci-Fi Horror Film	What is it about this sci-fi horror film that's so appealing ? All I know is that every time I come across it on cable , I almost have to stop what I'm doing and watch it . Governor Arnold leads a platoon of commandos into the jungle to face off against a malicious alien . There's your plot . It's an even more uber-macho version of the previous year's " Aliens " , the only difference being the location and the particular characteristics of the alien . This one has dred locks and can make itself invisible - - all you can see is a sort of ripple in the air when it wants to make itself unseen . It picks off the platoon members one by one in increasingly grisly fashion , until Arnie flexes his pecs and nukes the place . To be followed by numerous sequels , none of which I've seen , and all of which I'm sure were unnecessary .
573769	4532636	65724	7.0	A Fine Character Study	Jack Nicholson delivers a wonderful performance - - back when he was still playing characters other than Jack Nicholson - - in this well done but awfully gloomy film from Bob Rafelson . Nicholson plays Bobby Dupea , a worker on an oil rig with decidedly anti-social tendencies , who returns home to make peace with his dying father . Once there , he's confronted with the cushy , privileged life he left behind , and we learn that he turned away from a promising career as a concert pianist . What I like most about " Five Easy Pieces " is its ambivalence toward its main character . The film does not try to turn Bobby into some sort of noble hero , who shuns the establishment in order to uphold his own principles . He seems much more like a spoiled rich kid who can afford to be a slacker because he's never lived without a safety net . He fails to pursue a musical career , but more because he's lazy than because of anything that career would represent for him . And his treatment of his girlfriend , played heart breakingly by Karen Black in one of her many fascinating performances , is unnecessarily cruel . She's so dumbly loyal that mistreating her is the equivalent of mistreating a dog . But still , Nicholson is able to make us like Bobby , and to understand at some level where his anti-social behavior comes from . He is unable to tolerate the arbitrary rules and restrictions of bourgeois life , and a famous scene in a diner when he tries to order a tuna fish sandwich with toasted bread and ends up in a complicated argument with the waitress provides just one illustration of how Bobby perceives the world from which he is running .
573462	4532636	1129442	7.0	Statham Strips and Kicks Ass ( Sometimes at the Same Time )	More fast and furious action from Jason Statham , directed in this outing by Olivier Megaton ( is that name for real ? ) The " Transporter " series is the bargain bin version of the James Bond films , but I enjoyed this film way more than the latest Bond , " Quantum of Solace . " This installment exists as nothing more than a Jason Statham fetish movie . We see him kicking ass shirtless while the female in peril this time around ogles him . She later makes him perform a striptease much to her delight and - - let's be honest - - the audience's . You don't have to be female or gay to admit that Statham is a fine specimen of a man ; most guys would kill to look like him . And as someone who's follicly challenged myself , it's nice to see someone bringing sexy back to bald .
573913	4532636	45555	7.0	Don't Let Gloria Grahame Make the Coffee	Since I love film noir , I enjoyed " The Big Heat , " but I didn't feel that it distinguished itself from any number of other similar films from the same time period . This surprised me somewhat , as I don't think of Fritz Lang as an anonymous director , and he's usually able to imprint a strong visual style on his films . Not so for this story about a good and honest cop ( Glenn Ford ) who's dragged into the seedy underworld after his wife dies in a booby trap meant for him . Many of the themes common to this genre are present here : the blurred lines between the criminals and the law , the insidious encroachment of the scary city on the peaceful idyll of the wholesome suburb . It also picked up a main theme from " The Asphalt Jungle " : cops and robbers alike have families and lives separate from their work , and this fact makes them more like one another than they might want to admit . This film is most notable for a feisty performance from Gloria Grahame , who plays a gangster's moll who gets tired of being used and abused by her thug of a boyfriend ( a repulsive Lee Marvin ) and gets her scalding revenge . I've always felt that Grahame was never really used to her fullest potential by any film director , but she has such a strong screen presence that she's able to make this film all about her .
574006	4532636	94142	7.0	Refreshingly Nasty	A deliciously nasty black comedy about a middle-aged schlub ( Danny DeVito ) who wants to bump off his mother and hatches a plan to do so with a bitter divorcée , who wants to bump off HIS ex-wife . The movie is completely unapologetic in its cynicism , and gives us no one to like , but for once that works in the movie's favor rather than as a turn off . Anne Ramsey , as DeVito's battle axe mom , steals the show in a grotesquely funny performance . Even though she's a horror , you end up rooting for her , because it seems like she could kick both DeVito's and Crystal's asses at the same time with both hands tied behind her back .
574364	4532636	20475	7.0	Sally Bowles Anyone ?	Liza Minelli's character in " Cabaret " ( 1972 ) looks so much like Louise Brooks that you have to wonder if Minelli didn't model her look after the famous silent film star . " Diary of Lost Girl " puts the drama in melodrama . Brooks stars as a young innocent thing who's life goes a bad direction when she's introduced to every vice the world has to offer . Name a vice and it's in here : sex , booze , dance , gambling . It's like a public service message as broadcast by the Christian Coalition . It's a cautionary tale about the evils awaiting innocent souls , and it's pretty hard to take by the time the film has neared the two-hour mark . However , it's redeemed by a finale in which Brooks decides to devote her energies to helping other " lost " girls by truly understanding their plight , rather than cow them with moral fire and brimstone . Brooks is beautiful , but she's not much of an actress , at least not as evidenced by this film . Her Thymian ( what a name ! ) is a blank slate , and Brooks's reaction shots more often than not catch her staring at the camera with little or no expression on her face . Thymian is a girl who just lets things happen to her , so it's hard to muster up the requisite sympathy to really care about her plight . What's more interesting is the peripheral action always going on around her . The middle section of the film , which takes place in a home for wayward girls , captures some of the most entertainingly bizarre moments I've seen in a movie for a long time . The home is run by a butch dominatrix who leers lecherously at the girls while they eat soup and works herself into what appears to be a sexual frenzy when she forces them to perform nightly calisthenics ( which consist of the girls flopping over at the waist and then standing up again quickly , over and over , like fish gasping for oxygen ) . There's also a looming tall bald man who looks like he could have auditioned for the role of Lurch , who we see playing the piano one minute and gripping young girls by the backs of their necks the next . The best scene in the film comes when the girls turn on these two and begin pounding on them to the beat of a drum , making one wonder why the girls didn't do this much sooner , since there are about twenty of them and only two of the caretakers . People not familiar with pre-Code cinema ( and European pre-Code cinema to boot ) may be surprised at the adult subject matter in this film : nudie postcards , lesbian overtones , pre-marital sex , even a shot of a pregnant woman ( gasp ! ) . It's always a reminder of just how straight-laced movies became in the years shortly following the advent of sound . " Diary of a Lost Girl " is longer than it needs to be and doesn't exactly take the subtlest approach in its storytelling , but then what silent film ever did ? If you like silent films you will probably at least enjoy this one . If nothing else , it provides a nice introduction to Louise Brooks and the on-screen charisma that made her a star .
573744	4532636	90329	7.0	When Worlds Collide	This solid thriller stars Harrison Ford , given his first chance to truly act , as a detective who must infiltrate an Amish community in order to protect a little boy who accidentally witnessed a murder . Director Peter Weir and his screenwriter use the story as an opportunity to examine the culture clash between the modern world and the peaceful , insular world of the Amish . Ford's detective brings with him the violence and aggression of the outside world , but he also brings an understanding to the Amish , and especially to the mother of the little boy ( played by Kelly McGillis ) , that at heart he's not much different than they are , even if their cultures are . It's a good if unremarkable film , hampered somewhat by an obligatory and unnecessary love story that merely serves to slow things down .
573978	4532636	67093	7.0	Strong Material , Beautiful Score and Wonderful Lead Performance Overcome Heavy Directorial Hand	Director Norman Jewison does all he can to pound the life right out of this screen adaptation of the phenomenally successful Broadway musical , but thanks to the strength of the original material , he doesn't succeed . There are many better screen musicals , but there are also many that are far worse . Suffice it to say that Hollywood , which had churned out one disastrous musical after another for the last decade , finally got back to producing a musical it could be proud of . This beautiful story about a simple milkman in turn-of-the-century Russia who must come to terms with the loss of the safe and only world he has ever known , succeeds on screen largely due to the performance of Topol , who breathes body and soul into Tevye the milkman and creates one of those characters that for ever after you instantly associate with the actor who played him . You can feel him working overtime to keep Jewison's lumbering physical production on its feet , and his efforts prove themselves to be nearly Herculean , since Jewison can't direct a musical number to save his life . " Fiddler on the Roof " is not a dance musical , but it does have some rousing dance numbers courtesy of Jerome Robbins ; however , you wouldn't know it from this movie , since Jewison almost unfailingly chooses the worst camera angle from which to shoot every single frame of the musical portions . What the movie does boast , however , is a glorious version of the musical's beautiful score , left nearly intact and memorably orchestrated by John Williams . It soars and leaps even when the production it's anchored to just sits like a lump .
573455	4532636	29604	7.0	A Melodrama as Only 1930s Hollywood Could Present It	The same things that make " America's Next Top Model " entertaining make " Stage Door " a blast . " Stage Door " is even better , because we don't have to put up with Tyra Banks or her panel of hissy fashion " experts , " but we still get the house full of catty , superstar wannabes who throw insults at one another faster than the audience can keep up . Katharine Hepburn plays the rich daughter of a Midwestern business tycoon who takes a room in an all-female boarding house while she sets out to become a stage actress . The house is full of a bunch of been-there-done-that girls who all have their sights set on the stage , and have varying chances of ever seeing their dreams become reality . Ginger Rogers ends up as Hepburn's roommate , and their animosity for one another becomes a grudging affection over the course of the film . Rogers , because she's not being asked to play second fiddle to Fred Astaire , gets to show off her ample reserves of charm and comic ability , and she really steals the movie away from everyone else . I think the movie is supposed to be primarily about Hepburn , but you wouldn't know it , because Rogers so dominates the first half of the picture that it feels like the film's lost its way when she drops out of a good deal of its last half . Also in the house are Gail Patrick , playing a jaded beauty who's content to let sugar daddies provide her meals and entertainment ; Constance Collier , as an aging diva who takes the young actresses under her wing and tries to teach them their craft ; Andrea Leeds , in the film's most thankless role as a pathetic sad sack who has freak out scenes when she's not moping around and ends up hearing voices before throwing herself out of a window ; and Lucille Ball and Eve Arden serve as a kind of Greek chorus , charged mainly with providing sarcastic commentary on the action swirling around them . Adolphe Menjou rounds out the cast as a smarmy producer who lands Hepburn a choice part . The problem is , Hepburn's character is a terrible actress , and we're sure that her opening will be a total disaster , but she finds out that little ol ' Andrea Leeds took a swan dive just before she goes on , and the emotion it arouses in Hepburn causes her to give the performance of her life and become an overnight sensation . Only in 1930s Hollywood , folks . Don't even try to see the story as anything but the most ridiculous melodrama , and just enjoy the performances and the zingy dialogue . The movie is often very funny , both intentionally and unintentionally so . And as a sidenote , nearly every actress in this film reminded me of a contemporary actress . If I was casting this film now , Nicole Kidman would get the Ginger Rogers role ( I know , I know , I never would have thought Ginger Rogers looks like Nicole Kidman , but at times she does ) , Chloe Sevigny would get Eve Arden's , Debra Messing would DEFINITELY get Lucille Ball's ( they're dead ringers ) and Olivia de Havilland ( o . k . so I know she's not a contemporary actress , but the resemblance is striking ) would get Andrea Leeds ' .
573348	4532636	53291	7.0	Good , But Not One of the Greatest Comedies of All Time	My wife loves this movie , mostly on the strength of Jack Lemmon's wild performance , but I have to admit that I've remained resistant to its charms . I don't DISLIKE it , but I always have trouble understanding how it pops up again and again on various lists as one of the funniest comedies ever produced . Of course , much of my lack of appreciation probably has to do with the fact that cross dressing comedies have become a dime a dozen now , but were virtually unheard of at the time this film was released . And even more notable , Jack Lemmon's character actually kind of LIKES pretending to be a woman , so this film manages to work in some fairly ahead of its time gender politics into its mostly escapist comedy trappings . But the film is hampered by too much Marilyn Monroe , who was just a terrible actress , like it or not . The woman could not act , and no amount of sex appeal ( though I think she had very little of that as well ) could change that fact . Still , my reservations aside , the strengths in this film mostly outweigh the weaknesses . Billy Wilder delivers a sharp script even if his direction seems to be at cross purposes with the movie's comedic elements , and Tony Curtis gives a hilarious and dead-on impersonation of Cary Grant that rivals Lemmon's manic antics in its pricelessness .
573952	4532636	49408	7.0	A Worthy If Not Ideal Screen Adaptation	Director Walter Lang does his best to ruin what may be Rodgers & Hammerstein's strongest stage musical , but he's no match for the stellar material . He directs with a stodgy , anonymous style - - why actually move your camera around a set when you can root it to the floor as if it's a potted plant ? With the exception of Yul Bryner and Deborah Kerr , he elicits performances from his cast that would be at home in a cheesy sword-and-sandal Biblical epic . And the film has that overblown , garish visual design too common to big films from this time period , that manages to look both cheap and expensive at the same time , as if all the sets are made out of brightly colored plexiglass . But , and this is a big " but , " this musical tells a beautiful story about cultural tolerance that remains intact in the film , and the movie offers the strong performances of Bryner and Kerr , both perfectly cast in their roles . " Carousel " may have given audiences the most sophisticated R & H score , but for me , the music in " The King and I " remains the most glorious . Too bad the adapted film score severely truncates its stage counterpart : many songs are missing entirely , and almost all of those left are shortened versions . Happily , the " Small House of Uncle Thomas " ballet sequence remains in the film and retains the original Jerome Robbins choreography as it appeared on stage . It may just be the most memorable musical number ever conceived for stage or screen . This film isn't the best possible screen adaptation of a nearly perfect stage show , but thanks to Bryner and Kerr , and of course R & H , it'll do .
573963	4532636	33870	7.0	Birth of a Genre	It probably didn't know it at the time , but when " The Maltese Falcon " debuted in 1941 , it was inventing a new film genre , one of my personal favorites : the film noir . Films noir got better later in the decade and throughout the 1950's ; they got seedier , starker and more psychologically twisted . And if you can follow the plot of " Falcon , " you're either smarter or paying more attention than I . But I don't know that anyone watches movies like this for the plot , and while I didn't see the " Great Film " in this that others seem to see , I still appreciate its place in screen history for kick-starting two things : film noir and the career of Humphrey Bogart . As long as Bogie's on screen , no one else really even matters , not even Mary Astor in a sizzling role . Though one can't overlook the presence of Peter Lorre , who makes any movie a bit creepier on the strength of his weird looks alone .
574410	4532636	824747	7.0	If You Want to Ensure Your Film Won't Be a Masterpiece , Cast Either Half of Brangelina	Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are perfectly matched , as both boast beautiful faces and a painful lack of serious acting ability . However , in an acting face off , I'd put my money on Jolie . She did much better with her 2008 Oscar-bait outing , " Changeling , " than Pitt did with his , " The Curiously Boring and Pointless Case of the Blank-Faced Benjamin Button . " Jolie plays Christine Collins , a single mother in 1928 Los Angeles whose son goes missing . When the corrupt police department return the wrong boy to her and she tries to raise a stink about it , they have her committed to a mental institution rather than admit their embarrassing mistake . But eventually , a grisly discovery becomes too large a story to ignore , and the LAPD is brought to task for its dirty dealings . " Changeling " is a solid accomplishment from director Clint Eastwood . It's not anywhere nearly as good as his other 2008 film , " Gran Torino , " but it's not nearly as bad as its critical reception had led me to expect . But the film succeeds largely in spite of Jolie's performance rather than because of it . Jolie is simply not able to make sense of this character . Maybe the fault is with the casting in the first place . We have to believe that Christine Collins is timid and mousy enough to allow herself , even for a moment , to believe that the boy returned to her is in fact her son , even though she's convinced he's not . But there's not a timid bone in Jolie's body , and that part of the film never makes an ounce of sense . The Christine Collins we see humbly bowing to the whims of the police doesn't match up with the Christine Collins we see in the workplace , barking orders in her role as a manager , or the flirty , glamour puss Collins that emerges toward the film's end . Pick a character , any character . There are some quite disturbing scenes involving violence toward children ( violence seems almost too mild a term for what's actually done to them ) , scenes that are only slightly less disturbing than the ones in which John Malkovich appears , playing a pastor who aids Collins in her fight against corruption . Malkovich , by simply appearing in a film , brings it a healthy dose of " ick " factor , but I liked him here probably more than I ever have , just because he's one of the only characters in the movie who's not a slimeball . Jeffrey Donovan , of " Burn Notice " fame , plays the chief of police and decides for some reason to use an Irish accent that never quite materializes completely . Amy Ryan also appears as a fellow inmate in the institution , and looks and sounds like she should be starring in a women's prison film set in 1987 . However , the film itself looks good , and though it meanders a bit , it's always engaging . Because Eastwood chooses to give it an old-time Hollywood movie feeling , some of the more histrionic and heavy-handed elements go down smoother than they might otherwise . Let's face it , the man knows his way around a movie set , and he's probably incapable of making an outright bad movie . But next time , I might suggest that he check to see if Julianne Moore is available .
574400	4532636	86637	7.0	Woody Allen's Mockumentary	After scoring big with " Annie Hall " and " Manhattan , " Woody Allen had a bit of a dry run in the early 1980s with the forgettable " Stardust Memories " and " A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy . " " Zelig " found him back on track , and feels like a return to the screwball hijinks of his early 1970s films . Allen films " Zelig " as a documentary , and takes as his subject the life of a man who is able to blend in with his surroundings . Allen himself plays Zelig , and keeps everything - - both his performance and the film's tone - - utterly deadpan . There are a ton of funny one-liners and sight gags , but they're played completely straight . " Zelig " isn't one of Allen's most ambitious films , but it's very funny and is many times better than most of the movies he's making today .
573619	4532636	332379	8.0	Jack Black Scores	Jack Black is like Jim Carrey - - he works so hard at his comedy that the strain at first overshadows the humour . But like Jim Carrey , he keeps so insistently at his viewers that they can't help but be won over totally by his zaniness . I didn't think Black was very funny when this movie started , but he plays the role so earnestly and with so much personality that I was a Jack Black fan by the time it was over . There seems to be a generation of film makers now ( Richard Linklater , Cameron Crowe ) that are redefining the qualities that can make someone " cool , " and their movies are full of welcome messages . Cool isn't about how you look or dress or act . Cool's a state of mind , man . Peace out .
573372	4532636	63442	8.0	Monkey Business	Charlton Heston dons a loincloth and impersonates a human in this cheezy cult classic about a future world where apes walk upright and speak in clipped British accents . What a fun movie this is , thanks mostly to Heston's inability to deliver a line in a manner that even remotely resembles the way an actual human being would deliver it ( " You bloody baboon ! ! " ) The film makes a nice companion piece with another 1968 release in which apes figure heavily , " 2001 : A Space Odyssey , " though neither film will leave you feeling especially rosy about the eventual fate of man ( we're apparently going to be either personal valets to gorillas or abstract fetuses floating through space ) . A host of classy actors appears in this , but you won't recognize any of them , thanks to the truly impressive makeup effects of John Chambers . And take note , M . Night Shyamalan - - THIS is the way to use a surprise ending .
573300	4532636	470705	8.0	Sadly , a Movie That's Truly for Our Troubled Times	" Bug " is so strange and so rooted in stage origins that it could have gone very wrong as a movie , but it doesn't . While not without its flaws ( like a too abrupt ending ) , director William Friedkin and the small cast he assembled ensure that the movie works , and its enigmatic nature supplies an almost never-ending source of conversation to those who see it . As the movie started , I was worried that Ashley Judd was miscast as a poor white woman stagnating in a flea-bitten hotel in the middle of nowhere , Oklahoma . But she put my fears to rest . She gives a convincing , and by the end absolutely terrifying , performance as a woman who descends into a world of madness and paranoia . The man who drags her down with him is played by Michael Shannon , and he does astonishing work as well . These two hole themselves up in their hotel room , convinced that the government has used them as hosts for an experiment involving mind-controlling bugs , and the more delusional they get , the more they feed off of one another's paranoia until they've constructed a conspiracy theory to end all conspiracy theories . The movie is gruesome at times ( a scene involving a tooth pulling made me turn my face away ) , but it's full of thought provoking ideas and good writing , so the shock moments don't overwhelm the film's merits . It's clearly a response to the world's post - climate of fear and anxiety , where germs and chemicals have become weapons in a faceless war , and where the media is so pervasive that thoughts worm their way into your heads whether you want them to or not . One of the most interesting aspects of the film to me was the fact that these two lost souls create conspiracy theories to account for all of the things that are wrong in their respective lives and over which they feel like they have no control . If they create their own reality , they have power over it . Harry Connick , Jr . has a supporting role as Judd's thug of an ex-husband . Again , I thought he would be miscast and that I wouldn't be able to take him seriously , but he pulls it off . And stage actor Brian F . O'Byrne appears for one brief but memorable scene , and meets a grisly end . I bet this scene is one that provokes the most discussion . Based on the film's indifferent reception upon release , I wasn't expecting to like it nearly as much as I did .
573528	4532636	87332	8.0	Sigourney Weaver Fed My Childhood Fantasies	A special effects comedy extravaganza brought to you largely by members of " Saturday Night Live . " There are two things I remember most about this movie . One of them is Sigourney Weaver , who's smoking hot and is a far cry from the butch role she played in " Alien " and for which at the time she was probably most well known . The other is Rick Moranis , who is hysterical as a possessed geek and runs around stealing the movie right out from everyone else in it . Bill Murray is his droll self , the special effects hold up well even now , and how can you not like that theme song ?
574184	4532636	43265	8.0	Bogart and Hepburn ? An Unlikely Jungle Romance	Who would have thought that Humphrey Bogart , known for playing brooding tough guys ; Katharine Hepburn , known for playing strong-willed and ever-so-distant females ; and John Huston , a man's man director , could put together such a light-hearted , screwball comedy ? But that's exactly what happens with " The African Queen . " Bogart stepped way out of his usual screen persona to play this comical , grizzled character ; Hepburn launched the phase of her career that would find her playing uptight spinsters . I never would have thought they'd have any chemistry together , let alone produce even the palest of sexual sparks , but they're as natural a screen pair as either of them was separately with their respective frequent film partners . This adventure romance finds Hepburn's straight-laced missionary and Bogart's unkempt river-boat captain winding their way through the African wilderness . They do all the things you would expect them to do in a movie like this , but what they do best is bicker , down to the very last scene , where their bickering continues even as they are rescued and the final credits roll . According to film annals , Huston hadn't set out to make a comedy , but when he realized how much chemistry his two stars had , he changed gears and made a different movie than was originally intended . Thank God for that - - I'm not a big fan of Huston or his heavy-handed touch as a director , so I'm glad Bogart and Hepburn forced him to lighten up .
573728	4532636	462322	8.0	Tarantino Has Done It Again ; Rodriguez , Not So Much	What " Grindhouse " proves more than anything is how much better a director Quentin Tarantino is than Robert Rodriguez . It's unfortunate for Rodriguez that his film and Tarantino's are being presented in a format that allows the audience to compare them side by side ; the comparison only highlights Rodriguez's flaws and Tarantino's talent . " Planet Terror , " Rodriguez's segment , is a tribute to the trashy zombie flicks of yesteryear , but it's a completely disposable movie . I know Rodriguez would probably take that as a compliment , since the grindhouse films to which he and Tarantino are paying homage are remembered for being the movie equivalent of junk food . But Tarantino creates a film that could easily stand alone outside of the double feature gimmick concept , while Rodriguez uses his opportunity at genre parody to make nothing but a frenetic gross-out film . I had fun with a lot of " Planet Terror . " I especially liked Rose McGowan , as go-go girl ( don't call her a stripper ) Cherry Darling , who gets her leg gnawed off by crazed zombies and has it replaced with a machine gun that she uses to mow down her enemies while performing gymnastics . It's hooks like these that keep " Planet Terror " afloat . Rodriguez uses today's advanced technologies to include all of the outrageous images and stunts that makers of trash cinema would maybe have included themselves if they could have . But much of " Planet Terror " just made me feel sort of bad and depressed . The sight of mass human carnage in these post - days , when footage of suicide bombings assaults us on a daily basis , carries unpleasant connotations , and it's awfully difficult to lose yourself in the " fun " of seeing bodies ripped and blown apart with all of the indifference of a director who gets off on the site of human bloodshed . Therefore , I felt a slight sense of relief when " Planet Terror " ended . But then Tarantino's " Death Proof " came roaring on to the screen , and memories of Rodriguez's segment were immediately wiped away . In " Death Proof , " Kurt Russell plays stuntman Mike , who uses his grizzled charm to lure girls ( like Rose McGowan , who pops up again in this segment , albeit in a very different role ) into his bitchin ' retro car and then kills them . Or he follows groups of girls riding in their own cars and plows into them at 200 miles per hour , as he does in the film's most disturbing and graphic scene . But after doing away with one such group , he sets his sights on another ( the immensely charismatic trio of Rosario Dawson , Tracie Thoms and real-life stuntwoman Zoe Bell , who plays herself ) - - and instantly recognizes his mistake . Half way through " Death Proof , " Tarantino switches gears , and instead of following a " girls in danger " template , he makes the girls the dangerous ones . It's as if every female ever victimized in a grade-Z horror flick is resurrected in this group of fierce females , and work through them to get their revenge . The film is unpredictable , fresh , rousing and immensely exciting . It sent me out on a high . Tarantino is incapable of making a thoughtless movie , and I'm beginning to think he's incapable of making a bad movie . Where Rodriguez is content to appeal to the most basic urgings of the adolescent males he clearly assumed would be his audience for this , Tarantino is interested in doing something more . " Death Proof " is not simply imitative of grindhouse cinema . Tarantino has always excelled at mimicking the genres he loves while making something completely unique out of them , and he does the same here . " Death Proof " isn't only an homage to the loved films of Tarantino's past ; it's also an elegy . Stuntman Mike is a relic of an age when filmmakers created special effects in real time and space , without the help of CGI , and indeed no CGI was used in the astonishing extended action sequence that comprises the last third of Tarantino's film . He recognizes grindhouse films as the trash that they were , but it's clear that they also represent to him a certain kind of freedom that doesn't exist for filmmakers anymore . Makers of grindhouse movies knew that their films were going to be discounted by the mainstream movie establishment anyway , so they could revel in a kind of artistic freedom and make the movies they wanted to make without thought as to box office or awards potential . It's no wonder that this particular genre appeals to an auteur like Tarantino . And of course , linking these two films are the batch of fake trailers for other sleazy cinematic offerings . " Thanksgiving " seems to be the one that audiences remember the most , but I actually thought " Don't " was the wittiest , and the one that felt most authentic . " Planet Terror " : " Death Proof " :
574457	4532636	498380	8.0	Admired It , But Wasn't Overwhelmed By It	Clint Eastwood's " Letters from Iwo Jima " is a sober , haunting film , filled with striking images that I thought as I was watching the movie would stick with me longer than they did . I found myself admiring the movie very much , but not feeling greatly passionate about it one way or the other . It didn't resonate with me the way other films this year - - like " Children of Men , " for instance , or " Little Children " - - have . I think much of my reaction is due to the fact that Eastwood wants so clearly to make " great " films . He's a modern day John Ford or George Stevens - - he works with traditionally American subjects and in American genres ( even if , as in " Letters , " the point of view is not American ) , but like those directors , his desire to make films that people will remember him by sometimes infuses them with a formality that's hard to warm to . So it is with this film . One must give Eastwood credit , though , for embarking upon such a daring venture . Only someone with his clout could make a major studio film in a foreign language that asks us to sympathize with America's enemies in one of the world's largest calamities . And he does so without any sentimentality or bombast ; had Steven Spielberg made this movie , the results would likely have been unbearable . But Eastwood has a matter-of-fact quality to his storytelling , and mostly trusts his story to tell itself without forcing it on us with a heavy directorial hand . Even the film's visual pallet is subdued . Everything is a washed out brown and gray , and some scenes , notably the ones that take place deep in the caves in which the Japanese hide themselves , could be in black and white and look no different . The film is terribly sad - - the message that comes through more than any other is the hopeless waste of war . The Japanese don't stand a chance at beating the Americans on Iwo Jima , but they fight to the death , for dying is more noble than surrendering . The film reminds us that people don't fight wars ; governments fight wars , and people get dragged along behind to do their government's dirty work . " Letters from Iwo Jima " reminded me somewhat of " The Thin Red Line " in the way that it tells its story ( though I think " Red Line " is a better movie ) . It's ruminative and deeply psychological . Eastwood avoids the tendency of many war films to present us with a batch of interchangeable " types . " We understand what these men are thinking and feeling , and we understand what they've left behind , so that when they die , we care that they're gone . I have not seen " Flags of Our Fathers " yet , but wonder how that film will change my appreciation of this one . While I liked " Letters from Iwo Jima " very much , I wasn't overwhelmed by it . Perhaps the two films are better when taken together as a whole than either is by itself .
574191	4532636	64115	8.0	Bosom Buddies	The ultimate " buddy " movie . Buddy movies were all over the place in 1969 in various guises - - this , " Midnight Cowboy , " " The Wild Bunch , " " Easy Rider . " " Butch Cassidy " is the lightest and most accessible of these - - for that reason , I don't think it's as interesting to look at now as these other movies are . But it does serve up a dose of good old-fashioned Hollywood film-making , and in Paul Newman and Robert Redford , it presented audiences with a cinema duo as memorable as that of Laurel and Hardy or Abbott and Costello , or if you prefer a more contemporary example , Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau , who had manufactured a similar screen chemistry the year before in " The Odd Couple . " " Butch and Sundance " is mostly a nostalgic comedy , harking back to the glory days of screen westerns . But for all its levity , there is something dark about it that's hard to describe . Butch and Sundance are anti-heroes in the same way that Bonnie and Clyde were in Arthur Penn's brilliant film - - they've got the glamour of Hollywood movie stars , but their doom is sealed from the second the film starts , and because they're so likable and charismatic , it makes it that much more upsetting to see them destroyed . Like Bonnie and Clyde , Butch and Sundance find themselves unable to exist in a world intent on their destruction - - in this way , the film comments both on the death of the traditional western , and on the alienated restlessness of an entire younger generation that was beginning to make itself heard in American cinema . Also starring Katharine Ross as the third point in a love triangle , and featuring one of the best film songs ever recorded , " Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head , " which accompanies Paul Newman as he shows off for Ross on a bicycle in one of the movie's highlights .
574490	4532636	86979	8.0	Spooky and Stylish Early Coen Brothers	This early Coen brothers film shows what they can do when they're at the top of their game . This juicy noirish thriller has atmosphere and style to spare , with good performances from a handful of unconventional actors , notably Dan Hedaya , who makes a great bad guy , and Frances McDormand , who of course has gone on to become a Coen regular . " Blood Simple " introduced one of the thematic obsessions that have fueled some of the Coen brothers ' best later movies , like " Fargo " and " No Country for Old Men " : what kinds of unspeakable things are going on out there in the middle of the American nowhere when no one is around to see them ?
574176	4532636	37932	8.0	A Charming and Truly Suspenseful Little Gothic Thriller	Nina Foch delivers a surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this fun little Gothic nail-biter . She accepts a position as secretary to a London society dowager ( played imperiously by Dame May Witty ) and her creepy son ( the effete and bothersome George Macready ) . Before she knows it , she awakens to find herself in a seaside manor she's never seen before , where Witty and Macready are calling her Marian and trying to convince the servants and the nearby townspeople that she's Macready's mad wife . Of course this pair can only be planning dastardly deeds , and even though we know Julia has to eventually escape her trap , director Joseph Lewis builds real suspense in answering the question of just how she'll manage it . " My Name Is Julia Ross " has nothing stylistically to set it apart from any number of films that came out at the same time period , but I was surprised by how well it held together despite its shoe-string budget and B-movie pedigree . There are quite a few moments that just may have you on the edge of your seat , and I found myself really rooting for Julia as she caught on to the scheme underfoot and began to outsmart her captors . In any other Gothic thriller , the heroine would have swooned , screamed and dithered , waiting for her hero to come and save her . So I can't tell you how refreshing it was to have the heroine in this film use her brain and figure out how to save herself . Well done .
574112	4532636	311648	8.0	Took Me By Surprise	This film blew me out of the water . I was expecting an amiable , slight comedy , serving more than anything else as a launching pad for Katie Holmes's career into the Hollywood big time . But instead , this movie is a substantive and very moving story about a young girl who desperately wants to make a nice Thanksgiving dinner for a family from whom she feels somewhat estranged . It's extremely warm but extremely sad , and left me with a huge lump in my throat . Katie Holmes is winning and sweet as April , and whether or not you like Holmes , I bet you'll be rooting for her by the film's end . For one day , her whole world becomes about planning one successful dinner party , and her lack of skill forces her to fall back on the kindness of neighbors she's never taken the time to meet . Meanwhile , her family ( mother , father , brother and snotty sister ) are on their way into the city to April's apartment , whining and complaining about having to visit a crummy part of town and missing no opportunity to criticize April , while trying to ignore the white elephant in the room , the fact that their mom has cancer and may not live to see another holiday . Of course , the conversations they have with each other communicate heaps of back story and clue us in to the family dynamic , and we learn that April's biggest critic , her mom , also happens to be the most like her daughter . Patricia Clarkson has become one of my favorite actresses , and her Academy Award nomination for her performance as the mom in this film was richly deserved ( I think she should have won ) . She beautifully plays this role with just the right amount of sarcasm and wit to prevent the movie from ever getting bogged down in sentimentality . When she finally is reunited with April at the very end , what could have been an icky , maudlin ending instead knocked the wind out of me with its simplicity and honest emotion . " Pieces of April " just feels like one of those movies that is based on actual events in the life of its writer or director . It's full of tiny details of behavior that make the characters feel completely authentic , rather than creations . And there's a total understanding on everybody's part of the dynamics at play in a family that doesn't always get along and of that tendency of families facing some sort of crisis to latch on to one thing that's pretty mundane in order to avoid dealing with something else that is too big for the individual family members to deal with on its own .
574456	4532636	39973	8.0	Forgotten Thriller Is a Lot of Fun	A nifty little thriller that has lawyer Edmond O'Brien hired as bodyguard for business tycoon Vincent Price . Of course it doesn't take a detective to figure out that someone is setting someone else up , nor does it take a college diploma to figure out who those someones might be . Still , the cast ( which also includes Ella Raines and William Bendix ) is obviously enjoying themselves here , and if they're not going to take things too seriously , why should you ? It's best not to think too hard about the plot developments ( like why would a tycoon hire a lawyer to be his bodyguard in the first place ? ) and just enjoy the slick ride .
574268	4532636	379786	8.0	A Sleeper Hit	" Serenity " is one of those movies that flies in under the radar , quietly plays out its theatrical run , and then slowly but surely builds a solid base of fans and praise until sheer curiosity compels you to see it . I think it's based on something I'm not familiar with : a t . v . show or comic book series or something . And I'm not even a sci-fi / fantasy fan . I CAN enjoy sci-fi , but it has to be of a certain kind . Well , " Serenity " is that kind , and I had a lot of fun with it . It's greatest asset as a sci-fi movie is its sense of humour and its refusal to take itself too seriously . Just when things get too geeky or intense , there's a throw-away line or bit of physical comedy tossed in to help you regain your bearings . And the main hero ( a Han Solo type ) speaks with a strange old cowboy movie dialect ( " darlin ' " ) that takes a while to get used to but adds a sense of fun and silliness once you do . " Serenity " has an attractive cast with a lot of chemistry between them . And unlike other sci-fi stories , the characters here go beyond simple types easily summarized with a word or two , and instead become full-bodied personalities that you care about , so that when they're put in dangerous situations , you have something vested in what happens to them . The special effects are fine , but they're not what you come away from the movie remembering , which is a compliment . For once , spectacle doesn't drown story .
573374	4532636	63518	8.0	Probably the Best Version of Shakespeare's Tragedy We're Ever to Get	This filmed version of one of Shakespeare's most famous tragedies is likely to be about as good a version as will ever be produced . Director Franco Zeffirelli had warmed up the year before with the Burton / Taylor version of " The Taming of the Shrew , " but here he nicely transitions from the frantic comedy of the former to the darker and sadder tragedy of this story about star-crossed lovers ( played by Leonard Whiting and the famously big-bosomed Olivia Hussey ) . Zeffirelli infuses the film with the same kind of restless energy that was feeding the youth movement in 1968 , so this is one Shakespeare film that feels completely relevant to the time in which it was released . The film has beautiful production values ( the scene at the ball is a work of art all by itself ) and of course that famous musical theme . It shows reverence for the original text but doesn't feel stage-bound or stodgy ; yet neither does it feel like a product of trendy 60s cinema . And unlike the Baz Luhrmann debacle that passed as a version of " Romeo and Juliet " about 10 years ago , the actors in this version seem to both understand their characters and the lines they've been given to read .
573904	4532636	23969	9.0	A Great Time	I can't say I'm necessarily a huge Marx Brothers fan , but I also can't claim to be an expert on them , since I've only seen this and " A Night at the Opera . " Based on these two films , I've concluded that I like the IDEA of a Marx Brothers movie more than I like the movies themselves . Groucho is such a cultural icon that , like Charlie Chaplin , he inspires warm nostalgic feelings in movie buffs even if you've never seen one of his movies . However , that said , I have to assume that " Duck Soup " is the Marx Brothers at their zaniest best , and it is very funny . This is the film that includes the famous " mirror " scene , in which two men in a doorway becomes a hilarious comedic bit , as one man thinks he's looking into a mirror because the other is matching his actions and gestures . It's inspired scenes like that that seem to have given the Marx Brothers their longevity . You remember individual skits that can be easily shown in a 60 second clip rather than the movies as a whole .
574195	4532636	37101	9.0	Dick Powell Dances His Way Through the Role of Philip Marlowe	Dick Powell exchanges his dancing shoes for the film noir anti-hero's characteristic fedora in this fiendishly inventive 1944 entry based on the Raymond Chandler novel , " Farewell , My Lovely . " Many at the time questioned Powell's ability to pull off this tough-guy role , but he does just fine with it , thank you very much . His Philip Marlowe isn't as much of a hard case as the Sam Spade inhabited by Humphrey Bogart in " The Maltese Falcon " ; he doesn't have the same imposing physical appearance and he doesn't try to strong arm anybody to get what he wants . He uses a caustic tongue in place of a fist , and if he gets intimidated , scared or ruffled , you'll never know it , because he's always ready with a sarcastic comment to complement his cool exterior . In this movie , private detective Marlowe finds himself mixed up in a murky and byzantine scheme involving a jade necklace and a blackmail plot . Meanwhile , another case has him searching for a missing person , a Velma Valenti , one-time lover of a big ox named Moose Malloy ( Mike Mazurki ) . Gradually , Marlowe realizes that the two cases are connected , and he does his own share of scheming to make sure he's not the dupe that everyone involved seems to want him to be . Claire Trevor appears in a fabulous performance as one of the best femmes fatale ever to grace the genre . She has much in common with that other classic femme fatale from 1944 , Barbara Stanwyck in " Double Indemnity . " She also gets the film's best and most suggestive line - - when talking about a male " friend " and his desire to be a sculptor , she tells Marlowe , " He couldn't get started for fear of failure . " You've got to love film noir for lines like that . Anne Shirley gets saddled with the sweet , wholesome good girl role that all of these films must have in order to balance out the evil vamp ; she's about as uninteresting as you'd expect her to be . Director Edward Dmytryk adds all kinds of flourishes to the film to keep it visually appealing : imaginative use of key lighting , those angular shadows so common to films like this , a bizarre nightmare montage when Marlowe is tripping on heroin . Whenever Marlowe blacks out ( which is often ) , oily black fog comes curling out of the edges of the frame to engulf the screen . Dmytryk maintains a firm but light grip on the material and keeps his film just as playful as it ought to be . For coming so early in the film noir cycle , " Murder , My Sweet , " like " Double Indemnity , " is pretty cynical and bleak ( though it has a much happier ending than the other film ) . It's a high-water mark of its genre .
574052	4532636	112697	9.0	A Wonderfully Clueless Emma	Who would have thought that the best screen adaptation of Jane Austen's " Emma " would emerge from an updated parody set in a Beverly Hills high school and directed by Amy Heckerling ? But that's exactly what has happened with this film . Heckerling obviously gets that Austen's continuous appeal lies in the fact that her stories remain relevant and timely - - - so why not update it , make the character of Emma ( Cher here , played by the adorable Alicia Silverstone ) a daffy valley girl , and fill the movie to the brim with pop-culture references and one very funny vignette after another ? After all , the spirit and tone of " Emma " emerges unscathed . Comedic performances are always underrated , maybe because they look so easy , but Silverstone really deserves a lot of praise for this movie . It would be nothing without her performance .
574335	4532636	118694	9.0	In the Mood for a Truly Cinematic Film ?	It can be surprisingly difficult to find truly cinematic films - - that is , films that tell their stories in a way unique to the medium . Kar Wai Wong's " In the Mood for Love , " therefore , will come as a welcome surprise to cinephiles . I can imagine this story being told in another medium , but certainly not in the way Wong tells it . Set in 1962 Hong Kong , the movie is about a lonely man and a lonely woman who live next door to each other , and who discover that their spouses are having an affair with one another . Thrown together out of mutual feelings of rejection and hurt , the two embark upon a timid friendship that gradually becomes something more . They vow not to become like their unfaithful spouses , but what they do become can not be completely categorized . The movie is vague about how far they take their friendship , but the vagueness feels right , for this is a film not about obvious emotions but rather about the complicated inner workings of the heart and mind that don't always allow for tidy answers . Wong shoots the film in a dreamy , slightly surrealistic fashion . Nothing about the film is overtly avant garde , yet it's not entirely accessible as a traditional narrative film . You might spend the first fifteen minutes or so somewhat confused , but stick with it . Everything eventually makes sense , but it only makes sense after Wong has established a certain pattern and rhythm . Early scenes only have meaning after you've seen scenes later in the film . This is one of those films that gets in your head and stays there . It reminded me at times of both " Brief Encounter " and of the films of Douglas Sirk .
573914	4532636	70334	9.0	Are You Stoned , Mr . Marlowe ?	That most expert of genre benders - - Robert Altman - - takes aim at the noir detective film in this delightfully creative and witty adaptation of the Raymond Chandler novel . Altman - - not to mention Elliott Gould , who delivers a wonderfully whacked-out performance as Chandler staple Philip Marlowe - - gives us a hero who's right at home in the drifter , " everything goes " environment of 1970s L . A . His mumbled refrain throughout the film is " It's o . k . with me , " a refrain that sees him through all manner of confrontations , some of them life threatening . The plot is one of those convoluted puzzles for which films noir are known , having something to do with Marlowe's close friend , Terry Lennox , turning up dead in Mexico after supposedly murdering his wife . Marlowe , unable to believe that his friend would be capable of such an act , can't let the case drop even though the police want him to . And of course , in true noir fashion , he's hired for a separate case that at first seems to have nothing to do with the other but eventually turns out to be connected , involving the wife ( Nina van Pallandt ) of a suicidal novelist ( Sterling Hayden , giving a frightening and intense performance ) . But , also true to film noir ( and true as well of most Altman films ) , none of this plot really matters as much as the movie's tone , so artist and genre find themselves perfectly matched . Over the course of the film , we realize that Marlowe is the only honest person in this crooked version of contemporary L . A . , and he begins to seem like more of a relic from a past decade , a shuffling gumshoe that might be at home in a Warners crime film from the 40s , but who is woefully under equipped to handle the dirty dealings of the present . That is until a shocking and cold-blooded finale , in which Marlowe proves himself to be a bit more resourceful than we had given him credit for . There's a hip quality to " The Long Goodbye " - - it's a sustained joke of a film that Altman pulls off beautifully . Our introduction to Marlowe finds him going off in the middle of the night in search of his cat's favorite brand of pet food , and then trying to trick the cat into eating a brand it's not used to . This endears us to him , and we stay endeared to him for the rest of the film , thanks largely to the way Gould plays him . The film looks great too ; Altman's frequent collaborator on his early 70s pictures , Vilmos Zsigmond , does cinematography honors . And John Williams composed a great theme song , that plays in numerous variations throughout the film and contributes a running gag to the proceedings , popping up at one point as the funeral dirge being played by a Mexican band and at another as the tinkling tune of a doorbell . I've liked " The Long Goodbye " more and more every time I've seen it , and have quickly come to the conclusion that it's one of Altman's best .
574270	4532636	30241	9.0	A Holiday Worth Taking	" Holiday " belongs right up there with " The Philadelphia Story " and " Bringing Up Baby " as one of the best movies to team Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant . Watching it today , it's nearly impossible to understand why audiences stayed away from this and " Baby " back in 1938 . These movies have instant classics written all over them . " Holiday " is much closer to " Philadelphia Story " than " Baby " in its style of comedy . Contrary to the labels people have assigned it , it is NOT a screwball comedy - - in fact , it's quite serious and brings a tremendous amount of character depth to its story , much in the way " Story " would two years later . Hepburn of course plays the sister of a shallow girl who's about to be married and who only thinks of living a luxurious lifestyle . Grant waltzes in and finds that he and Hepburn are soul mates . The scenes in which these two , along with an intellectual professor and his wife , lambast the vacuous lives of the stinking and very dull rich , are the movie's highlights . " Holiday " is one of those movies that never becomes irrelevant , not to people who still think that intelligence , imagination , creativity and ideas are more valuable commodities than material possessions .
573773	4532636	65492	9.0	I Love This Movie	If ever there was a love it or hate it film , this is it . " Brewster McCloud " is a glorious mess , an imperfect film in that fascinatingly imperfect way that only Robert Altman could pull off . I admit that much of my affection for this film lies in the fact that I studied it in a Robert Altman seminar ; each of us picked one movie to watch , analyze and report back on to the class , and this was mine . I was completely befuddled by it the first time I watched it , but then after I'd seen it three or four times , trying to make sense of it in order to talk to the class about it , I sort of fell in love with it . Brewster , played perfectly by Bud Cort , lives in the Houston Astrodome and harbors the intense desire to fly . His efforts in that direction are complicated by any number of odd-ball characters , including a rich tycoon for whom he works as a chauffeur ( an unrecognizable Stacy Keach delivers a howler of a performance as the tycoon , and has far too little screen time ) , a private investigator ( Michael Murphy ) with a penchant for colorful turtlenecks who's investigating a series of murders around the city , and a couple of bizarre female love interests , played respectively by Jennifer Salt and a divinely whacked out Shelley Duvall . Meanwhile , a sort of guardian angel ( Sally Kellerman ) with scars on her back where wings used to be follows Brewster around and may just be responsible for the murders taking place around the city ( every corpse the cops find is splattered with bird crap ) . And last but not least , in perhaps the most bizarre role ( and that's saying something in this movie ) , Rene Auberjonois plays some kind of professor delivering a lecture on man's desire to fly , who serves as a kind of narrator for the film and gradually turns into a bird himself . Much of the film doesn't really make any sense in a conventional way , even after multiple viewings . The film is a lot like Altman's break out hit , " MASH , " from the same year , with the overlapping dialogue , chaotic action and super-sarcastic sense of humour , but it doesn't have a universal topic like war around which to anchor itself , and many viewers might feel like they're watching an extended inside joke not meant for them . What is one to make , for example , of the use of Margaret Mitchell as a cranky old lady whose face we never see but whose voice is ingrained in our collective subconscious , and who is wearing an awfully familiar pair of ruby slippers when her body is found , victim to the mysterious avian serial killer ? The allusion to " The Wizard of Oz " of course is obvious , but what purpose does it serve ? The same can be said of Murphy's hilarious , dead-pan parody of Steve McQueen's character Bullitt , and the movie even includes a ridiculous and long high-speed car chase that pays homage to the one in that 1968 hit . It's all very funny , and maybe that's point enough , but I can't pretend to know what Altman was trying to say . But the ending , after all the glibness that has preceded it , comes to a poignant and quite emotionally affecting conclusion . Bud Cort is the perfect actor to make us root for Brewster , and once we see this strange and even rather creepy kid get himself airborne with a set of makeshift wings , our hearts soar and we want to see him achieve the impossible . Watching him frantically flapping his wings as he sails around the Astrodome , only to plummet to his death , offers a sad reminder that some dreams , no matter what optimists may say , are never attainable . Believe it or not , " Brewster McCloud " was the 1970 release that Altman thought would be the biggest hit , and he was very disappointed when " MASH " scored five Academy Award nominations and " Brewster " was ignored . One can't even conceive how Altman ever thought the stuffy Academy would go for something as esoteric as this .
574113	4532636	27652	9.0	Vengeance Breeds Vengeance	" Fury " is a ferocious movie from Fritz Lang about the impulses that drive mob violence . It belongs in the same category as films like " The Ox-Bow Incident " and " 12 Angry Men " and other movies that show how a group of normally decent people can turn quickly to animals when they smell blood . Spencer Tracy plays Joe ( read " average Joe " ) , who finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time and ends up sitting in a country jail , pegged for a kidnapping he didn't commit . The townspeople get wind that someone has been arrested for the crime , and they want to exact their own brand of justice , not much caring on whom they carry it out . In a spectacular sequence , they storm the jail , burning it down and killing ( they think ) Joe . But Joe manages to escape , and the fury he feels at the way they treated him fuels his own feelings of vengeance , until he becomes as ruthless as those he denounces . Lang's movie is unique in that it poses a particularly interesting moral dilemma . The men and women who are on trial for murder ( for Joe keeps the fact that he is alive a secret , just so he can see them hang ) truly did act like murderers . The fact that Joe survives is no thanks to them ; it was pure luck that he escaped . Yet can Joe really let men be punished for a crime they didn't technically commit , and if he does , is he any better than they are ? " Fury " is not an easy movie . There aren't tidy answers to the conflicts ( though there is the obligatory happy ending demanded of films from this time period ) . Sylvia Sidney plays Joe's soon-to-be bride , and provides the film with its moral conscience . She's the prosecution's ace-in-the-hole witness , able to both identify the members of the mob and attest that it was Joe who was locked up in that jail cell . But as she begins to suspect that Joe is really alive ( thanks to some clever clues that Lang places throughout the movie ) , she begins to experience a moral crisis of her own . All of this is told in Lang's typical high style : terrific use of camera work , sound , music . The frenzied mob scene is a coup de cinema , and Tracy gives a taut and disciplined performance in the central role . There's also a very interesting comment on the power of visual media that plays a large role in the prosecution's evidence during the trial scenes . One has to conclude that this was a response to the importance of the motion picture newsreel that had by that time become a staple of the film going experience and would be paid homage as an art form of its own 5 years later in " Citizen Kane . " " Fury " is a terrific , lesser-known film from the 30s .
574070	4532636	47296	9.0	A Terrific Ensemble and Sizzling Direction Keep This Flawed Classic Watchable	On rewatching " On the Waterfront " recently , I found it to be preachy and schematic , more like a dose of medicine than a form of entertainment . However , I think that's what sometimes happens to socially relevant films when the context in which they first appeared is long past , and this fact should not be held against the movies themselves . Despite any cracks that may have surfaced in the facade of Elia Kazan's film over the years , it still remains a blisteringly powerful movie . Marlon Brando had a singular appeal as an actor . He attacked his roles like a wounded bull , bluntly charging around the screen while letting glimpses of a vulnerable and aching center show through . I would have said that his performance here as Terry Malloy was his best - - if I had not seen the woeful " Last Tango in Paris , " a dreadful movie that nevertheless showcases Brando at his highest level of greatness . His " I coulda been a contender . . . " soliloquy in " Waterfront " has been hopelessly parodied in the intervening years , but I hope that doesn't prevent viewers new to the film from appreciating what a truly heartbreaking and moving cinematic moment Brando creates while delivering it . Watch also the supporting players in this film , particularly Rod Steiger as Terry's brother , both stronger and weaker than his younger sibling , who obviously admires Terry even while he's baffled by him . Even though Brando gets all of the choicest lines in the above-mentioned contender scene , Steiger matches him every step of the way with his hang-dog , nuanced facial expressions . Lee J . Cobb blusters and shouts his way through his performance as the mob heavy ; he serves the function required of him but grows tiresome by the time the movie ends . Karl Malden gives an impassioned performance as a local priest and Eva Marie Saint single-handedly provides the film with some much-needed estrogen . She never gave another performance to equal this one . I greatly admire Elia Kazan as an artist . I don't care about his personal actions or beliefs ; he made great movies , and what he did in his private life does not change that fact . He could make virtually any material better than it would have been in the hands of another director , and what saves " On the Waterfront " today from its heavy-handedness , aside from the remarkable acting , is Kazan's fierce commitment to the material and his explosive directorial decisions . " On the Waterfront " may be flawed , but it's still a classic .
573982	4532636	468489	9.0	A Remarkable Variation on the Teacher Saves Student Theme	Ryan Fleck's writing and directorial debut is sober and even somewhat glum , but it boasts a tremendous and committed performance from Ryan Gosling in the lead role ; an understated and sweet performance from the young actress Shareeka Epps in a supporting role ; and an intelligent , thoughtful , spare screenplay that avoids falling prey to easy sentiment . Gosling plays Dan Dunne , a young history teacher from a liberal family who himself has liberal ideas and a charismatic way with his students . They like him in a guarded way , despite the fact that he's white and part of the institution that most of them , black kids from an impoverished neighborhood , have been taught to distrust . Dan is filled with the kind of optimism that many of us had coming right out of college , when we cared passionately about our beliefs and believed we could make others care as much about them . However , Dan's promise as a teacher is severely limited by his addiction to crack , which consumes his personal life and turns his lectures into chaotic ramblings . One of his students , a quiet girl named Drey , finds Dan after school hours stoned in the girls ' locker room , and an unlikely bond forms between the pair . Something about witnessing this intensely private and human side to her teacher makes Drey able to trust him and open up to him more than she can to anyone else in her immediate circle , which includes a well-intentioned but distracted mom , a brother in prison , and a no-good drug dealer friend of the family , who wants to put Drey to work delivering to customers . Meanwhile , something about the encounter works the same effect on Dan . It's as if being caught in the act removes the burden of secrecy , and he can let his guard down when with Drey . The two begin looking forward to their casual encounters and conversations , and each fills a void in the other's life . This isn't at all creepy or inappropriate . Drey may have a harmless crush on Dan in the way that young students often do on their teachers . Dan , for his part , becomes protective of Drey , and tries to convince her to stay away from the drug scene even as the example he sets conveys the exact opposite . He tenaciously clings to the belief that one man can indeed make a change even as the indifference and hardships of his immediate world tell him otherwise . " Half Nelson " paints a grim and harrowing picture of drug addiction and loneliness , and much of it is painfully depressing . But there's a tremendous warmth working under the surface of Fleck's film which prevents it from feeling nihilistic . Dan and Drey are both good people , trying to make their way in a world that doesn't always reward them for simply being good . The conclusion of the film is only mildly uplifting . We have the feeling that Dan has weathered some sort of crisis and has made some realizations about himself and his addiction , but the movie ends before we see what he does with that insight . He may ultimately be o . k . , or he may not . What's more important is that Drey will be o . k . , and one of the things I liked most about " Half Nelson " was its suggestion that many times the most effective role models are those who show us who we DON'T want to be , rather than those who we want to emulate . Gosling proves himself to be a young actor to watch with his performance here . Not once does he step out of character , and he exhibits a tremendous screen presence . He's able to charm us as much as he is his students . Shareeka Epps has a sweet , warm quality to her . Most of the time she keeps her mouth set and rigid , and conveys the quality of someone who's determined to be disappointed in the world so that the world won't have a chance to disappoint her first . But every once in a while , a character will make her smile , and when she does , her face lights up the screen . This is a fine film and one that lingered in my head . Highly recommended .
573824	4532636	78788	9.0	This Movie Isn't About Vietnam ; It IS Vietnam	Francis Ford Coppola's extraordinary Vietnam film is deeply flawed , but in this case the flaws feel so right for the subject matter that they almost make the movie better . This movie is a perfect marrying of source material and directorial vision . Setting Joseph Conrad's " Heart of Darkness " against the backdrop of the Vietnam jungles is brilliant , and the dark odyssey of Martin Sheen's character is so nightmarish , feverish and sweaty that this movie feels more like it IS Vietnam than merely ABOUT Vietnam . With a number of memorable appearances , notably Robert Duvall as a war-hungry Army officer glorying in the carnage around him ; Dennis Hopper as a drugged out photojournalist who's lost his mind to the jungle ; and , perhaps most memorable for its pure weirdness , Marlon Brando as Kurtz , the officer who's gone missing and has fashioned himself as a dark God amongst the primitive natives . The movie totally loses its way toward the end , but that somehow feels right . Recommendation : Don't watch the redux version if you can avoid it . It's yet further proof that directors usually have good instincts and that what they initially cut from their movies should remain cut .
573939	4532636	32143	9.0	Claws Out , Ladies	Lovers of glamorous bitch fests will have the time of their lives with this gem from 1939 . MGM's best female talent were assembled for this catty story about females good and bad , and all of the conniving , backstabbing , hissing and scratching that ensues whenever you have a group of ladies together at one time . Of course it's all exaggerated , and even fairly retrograde by today's standards , but I encourage everyone to muffle those feminist sensibilities for two hours and allow yourselves to have fun here . Norma Shearer plays the goody-goody heroine , Joan Crawford plays the deliciously malevolent villainess , and Rosalind Russell steals every scene she's in as a brassy society lady with far too much time on her hands . George Cukor was directing at the height of his talents , and keeps things snappy and smart . A treasure to relish from one of Hollywood's golden years .
574180	4532636	420087	9.0	An Elegy for a Stunning Career	By now , Robert Altman films are a genre unto themselves . They have a language of their own , and there are people who either speak that language or don't . At this point in his career , I doubt that Altman is trying to win over any converts ( if he ever was ) . So let me say this about " A Prairie Home Companion " : whatever else it may be , it is first and foremost an Altman film . If I had been dumped into the middle of this movie , I would have been able to tell you who directed it . As for the movie itself : it's wonderful . It's warm , sad and at times very funny . It's diffused with a nostalgic glow that lasts long after the film itself is over . If there's a unifying motif , it's death , yet the movie never feels morbid or grim . Rather , it's about paying tribute to the past even as you're letting go of it - - it feels like a work made by an artist who is getting ready to say goodbye . This is Altman , so it doesn't all work . There are awkward moments . But Altman is only ever awkward because he tries daring things , and I'd much rather sit through a bad Altman film ( o . k . maybe not " Quintet " ) than just about any other good but conventional film . And most everything about " Prairie " works quite well . Altman has assembled a marvelous cast that rivals the boat-load of Brits he assembled for " Gosford Park . " Each has his / her moment to shine , and no one feels neglected , as can sometimes happen in Altman's large ensemble pieces . I'm not going to single anyone out , because they're all equally deserving of praise . They're obviously having a great time working with one of the best directors of actors who's ever lived , and their sense of fun is infectious . And as he proved with " Nashville , " Altman can make country music sound great to people who don't even ordinarily like country music . This is perhaps the warmest film yet that Altman has made during his long career , proof that the old curmudgeon maybe has a soft spot after all .
574047	4532636	20122	9.0	A Beautiful , Bittersweet Silent	This was my first exposure to Janet Gaynor , and I fell in love with her . She plays a poor , ragamuffin country girl who begins a timid romance with a wheelchair-bound WWI veteran ( Charles Farrell ) , against the stern wishes of her mother , who wants her to marry instead a swaggering bully . Director Frank Borzage keeps the potential mawkish sentimentality at bay , and pulls achingly beautiful and naturalistic performances from his actors . When you watch Gaynor's face in this film , able to convey heaps of emotion ( just get a look at her when she first realizes Farrell is confined to a wheelchair ) with the most nuanced of glances , it's no surprise that she was able to make a successful transition to sound film and continue as a huge star and box-office draw throughout the 1930s . The forbidden love storyline is the stuff of standard silent film melodrama , as is the suspenseful race-against-time finale that finds Charles Farrell willing himself to walk so that he can get to Gaynor before her husband-to-be takes her away forever . All of that is as silly as it sounds . But it's the quieter moments that give this film its gentle appeal : like the surprisingly erotic scene in which Farrell decides Gaynor needs a makeover and washes her hair with the yolks of a dozen eggs ; or the beautiful bittersweet moment when Farrell gives Gaynor a gold bracelet that looks like an over-sized wedding ring . A film center in Chicago is showing a festival of Gaynor and / or Borzage films , and I look forward to seeing more of both of them .
573626	4532636	286244	9.0	A Quirky Delight	It's kind of hard to describe " The Triplets of Belleville " other than to say that it's truly original . It made me long for the days of old-fashioned hand-drawn animation , the kind that Disney revolutionized before turning to CGI . Interestingly enough , there's a car chase scene toward the end of the film that reminded me of " 101 Dalmatians , " and I said as much to my wife while we were watching it . It was something about the way the cars were drawn and moved , and the color palate in general . Then in the supplementary materials , one of the film's creators cites " 101 Dalmatians " as an inspiration , so I was able to congratulate myself on my perceptiveness . It doesn't take much to make me happy : )
574503	4532636	81283	9.0	A Powerful and Dead-On Portrayal of Intense Family Dysfunction	A searing dysfunctional family drama that holds up very well today . Living on Chicago's north shore as I do , I can say with authority that this movie completely nails a certain kind of affluent north shore community that exists in Chicago suburbs like Lake Forest , Winnetka , Highland Park , etc . , places where people erect hedges and fences not so much to keep people out as to keep family problems and secrets in . Director Robert Redford and writer Alvin Sargent clearly understand their subject matter . And in fact , this film so closely mirrors many of the personal circumstances of my wife and her family ( my wife even established a productive relationship with a Jewish therapist who works out of Skokie , no less ) , that we joke that the film is really about her . Maybe it's my closeness to the subject matter that gives me my appreciation of the movie , but even without that I still think that I'd consider this film to be a superb drama , flawlessly acted . Speaking of the acting , Mary Tyler Moore , Judd Hirsch and Timothy Hutton were all recognized with Academy Award nominations ( Hutton won ) for their work in this film , all deservedly . Moore especially is memorable in her portrayal of a brittle power mom who must constantly hide behind a veneer of icy aloofness for fear that one tiny crack in her facade will send her crumbling to pieces . But two other actors deserve praise as well : Donald Sutherland , as a suffering father who's ill-equipped to deal with his family's problems yet whose heart is in the right place ; and Elizabeth McGovern , who brings a sense of normalcy and healthiness into the film like a fresh breeze off Lake Michigan . There's a lot of talk about whether this film is better than " Raging Bull , " which came out the same year and lost the Best Picture Oscar to " Ordinary People , " which only goes to show how lame award competitions are when it comes to movies - - how can you possibly compare the two ? See them both .
573985	4532636	443706	9.0	Not Your Average Serial Killer Movie ( And That's a Good Thing )	" Zodiac " may frustrate viewers who come to David Fincher's latest film expecting a traditional serial killer thriller . The film begins with a couple of hair-raising and rather brutal recreations of murders carried out by the mysterious killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1960s and early 1970s . These early scenes are shocking and , compared to the rest of the film , disorienting , because they offer the only time that we come close to seeing events from the killer's perspective . As the film progresses , the Zodiac killer himself fades into the background , and the movie turns into a meticulous and engrossing document of the investigation to track him down , an investigation that includes countless blind alleys and false clues and which to this day has not reached a conclusion . I would be more prone to label the somewhat rambling screenplay as sloppy storytelling if I did not feel that Fincher tells the story exactly as he wants to . The elusive narrative works , because the film is about an elusive villain . Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith , a cartoonist working for the " San Francisco Chronicle " at the time the Zodiac killer began his gruesome work . He becomes fascinated by the case , and takes it on as a sort of morbid personal hobby long after the police department has given it up as a lost cause . Graysmith eventually wrote the book on which this film is based , and according to his accounts , he discovered enough evidence about one of the suspects in the case to put the police back on his trail years after he'd been cleared for lack of evidence . Other characters come and go . Robert Downey , Jr . does characteristically terrific work as a reporter at the " Chronicle " who grabs his own portion of notoriety through his involvement in the case . Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards play the two detectives in charge of the investigation . Chloe Sevigny plays Gyllenhaal's put-upon wife , who gradually loses her husband to his obsession . All of the actors deliver thrilling performances , many of them against the odds . Since this isn't a character driven movie , many of the characters remain undeveloped , but not , for once , to the detriment of the film . This story isn't about the people involved , but rather about their role in the Zodiac saga ; once they've served their purpose , Fincher dispenses with them . Ironically , a film that clocks in at nearly 3 hours exhibits a great deal of narrative economy . Parts of " Zodiac " are intensely creepy . Fincher effectively uses the rainy San Francisco atmosphere to its maximum potential , and the grimy browns and grays of the production design call to mind Fincher's other well-known films , like " Seven " and " Fight Club . " But " Zodiac " is much more grown up than those films , and for an audience to enjoy it , it has to have an attention span . Long scenes are given to analyzing handwriting samples , recreating the scenes of murders , digging through newspaper clippings and files . You can tell that Fincher is fascinated by police work in the pre-CSI era , when fax machines were still a novel invention . He delves into the investigative process with a nearly fetishistic attention to detail , but he makes all of it endlessly mesmerizing . He does his best to bring everything to some sort of conclusion , but the real-life end to the story makes a complete conclusion impossible . This film is more about the journey than the destination , and what a journey it is .
573753	4532636	31381	9.0	Frankly . . . . This Is One Fine Movie	I know " Gone with the Wind " has been teased to death , and there seems to be a sort of snob appeal among the film critical community in denegrating this film as overblown Hollywood melodrama . But the thing that impresses me about " Gone with the Wind " after seeing it recently on the big screen is that it's one hell of a good movie . The entire first half moves with a propulsive energy that not many films can match . Victor Fleming ( billed as director , though there were at least four director names attached to the project ) stages one sensational set piece after another , and hardly a scene goes by without a quotable line or a memorable image . The success of any adaptation of " Wind " is going to rely greatly on its Scarlett , and here I can't say enough about Vivien Leigh's performance . I quite simply cannot imagine any other actress in this role , so perfectly does Ms . Leigh embody it . She's in virtually every scene , but even after four hours of her , I'm not tired of her , and her ability to captivate the screen while she's on it doesn't lessen for an instant . Clark Gable is Clark Gable , perfect for his role as well and an able match for Leigh , but his performance plays as window dressing as compared to Leigh's powerhouse work . I also want to mention Olivia de Havilland . In her own way , she is just as powerful in her role as Leigh is in Scarlett's . Melanie's character is less dynamic and so by sheer necessity de Havilland is frequently upstaged by Leigh . But she holds her own nonetheless . And what struck me is the chemistry the two actresses have when on screen together . The scene in which Scarlett attends a party dressed in bright red , braving the gossip she knows will attend her presence , and Melanie walks slowly forward , determined to prove herself a refined lady by welcoming Scarlett unconditionally , is a tour de force for both actresses . I take points away for some soap operatic elements in the second half that grind the story to a halt , but otherwise this film deserves its place as one of the greatest achievements in American cinematic history .
574420	4532636	53604	9.0	A Dark Romantic Comedy	Jack Lemmon plays a nice guy sad sack and Shirley MacLaine the wayward waif with whom he's smitten in Billy Wilder's bittersweet romantic comedy that's long on the bitter and short on the sweet . Wilder nails the sterile world of corporate American anonymity in this film . Lemmon's character is a worker bee , whose work space is lost amid a sea of identical spaces , captured brilliantly by the art direction as a black and white version of a human ant hill . The only thing distinguishing Lemmon from the multitudes is his apartment , which the good ol ' boy management staff like to use for their adulterous trysts , and which Lemmon himself never seems to need for the same purpose . He falls for elevator operator MacLaine , a brassy yet wistful cutie , who happens to be one of his boss's said trysts . Things get complicated as Lemmon has to decide which is more important to him : the moral high ground or climbing the corporate ladder . Lemmon essays a tricky role beautifully . I would have been instantly annoyed by this character had anyone else played him . It's hard to feel sorry for a doormat who can't say " no , " but Lemmon makes it virtually impossible not to like his character . MacLaine , too , delivers one of the best performances of her career , a rather ballsy one in a way , as she makes her elevator operator unsympathetic through much of the movie . This pair of unconventional actors creates a refreshingly bleak romance , if there can be such a thing . The only thing that seems to be preventing both of these characters from getting completely lost in the crush of indifferent humanity is their tenuous connection to one another . " The Apartment " is a perfect New Year's Eve film . It superbly taps into that feeling of being lonely while surrounded by people that only those who live in big cities can understand . Anyone who's commuted to work on a subway or bus will instantly recognize the feeling this movie conveys .
573537	4532636	32599	10.0	Roz Russell Is on the Case	Every good thing you've heard about this movie is true . It may very well be the fastest paced movie I've ever seen . Jerry Bruckheimer's most hyperbolic action movie ain't got nothing ' on this one . Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell were a brilliant screen pair ( indeed , it seems that no one was bad casting when paired with Cary Grant ) as rival reporters in a furiously paced news office . Russell is the odd man , or should I say odd girl , out , due to her lack of a penis , but she proves herself more than capable of holding her own with the boys . Russell charges across the screen and never loses momentum for a second . She's goofy , sexy and hysterical . The funniest moment in the film comes when she's chasing a man down the street ( I won't go into details ) and dive tackles him to the ground . One of the first films from the 40s and a highlight of the decade .
574009	4532636	65214	10.0	Sam Peckinpah's Bloody Wild West	Sam Peckinpah's sensational , elegiac western did for that genre what " Bonnie and Clyde " had done for the lovers-on-the-lam genre two years earlier . William Holden , Ernest Borgnine , Edmond O'Brien and Robert Ryan - - all throwbacks to an earlier , more traditional style of Hollywood film-making - - star in this revisionist western about a group of over-the-hill outlaws looking to pull off one big last score before packing it in for good . Set in the days just before World War I , the film shows how technological progress gradually begins to make these outlaws obsolete . Cars replace horses ; machine guns replace rifles . At the same time , the moral code that governed the wild west makes way for a newer , more chaotic moral order , where the good guys can no longer necessarily be separated from the bad . The literal story of aging gunfighters serves dual purposes under Peckinpah's direction . He's as much interested in the death of the traditional Hollywood western as he is the death of these specific characters . With Vietnam raging , the quaintness and black and white simplicity of John Wayne simply didn't fit in any longer with the reality of the times . Peckinpah gave us violence in " The Wild Bunch " that matched the grim images bleeding their way into families ' homes via television . Therefore , in this film , when somebody gets shot , he doesn't fall neatly and bloodlessly into the dust . Wounds in this film spurt blood into the air ; bullets tear through flesh . The violence in " The Wild Bunch " is tame when compared to the graphic violence in films today , but it shocks more , mostly because it seems to matter in a way that violence in today's films doesn't . Superbly edited as well as directed , " The Wild Bunch " is terribly exciting and quite disturbing . It's a high-water mark of 1960s film-making .
573432	4532636	206634	10.0	Left Me Speechless	I'm nearly at a loss for words . " Children of Men " took my breath away with the sheer visual audacity of its storytelling and the deep strength of feeling contained in it . Alfonso Cuaron , adding his voice to the many other directors who have made post - films about the grim state of a world governed by terror and hopelessness , has given us one of the most memorable and dramatically satisfying films I've seen in a long , long time . Much ballyhoo has greeted the trio of Mexican directors who released films this year , and people have been wetting themselves over Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu's " Babel " and especially Guillermo Del Toro's " Pan's Labyrinth . " " Children of Men " blows both of these films off the map . Cuaron's world view seems to be as grim as his compatriots , but unlike Innaritu and Del Toro , Cuaron seems to think that the world in which we live is worth saving and uses his movie to deliver a practical message of hope that resonates in the here and now . " Children of Men " is the most uplifting downer I think I've ever seen , and the long scene in which a small , crying baby temporarily halts the warfare and carnage taking place around it , for one instant uniting enemies in the wonder and glory of new life , reduced this viewer to tears ( and I don't cry easily at movies ) . Cuaron's visual style is absolutely stunning . He creates a meticulously detailed vision of a nightmare future that is all the more horrifying for its plausibility . And there are a couple of extended set pieces ( I'm thinking most notably of the one in which a car containing our hero , Clive Owen , and a group of activists / terrorists is attacked by an angry mob , the entire scene filmed in one long take by a camera that never leaves the car ) that astounded me with their showmanship . And yet , for all of its directorial panache , I never felt that style overwhelmed substance - - Cuaron ably and completely welds style to subject in such a way that his approach always perfectly serves the story he's telling without drawing attention to itself . I think it's very interesting that the end of this film is inspiring so much debate , and that different people have completely opposite readings of it . Some think it's dismally depressing , lacking in any sign of hope . Others think it's optimistic , the happiest ending possible in such a dystopian work of fiction . I believe the ambiguity is intentional on Cuaron's part , and I personally came away exhilarated by the powerful message of hope , and a reinforcement of the belief that there will always be good people willing to do good things for others in the belief that the world can change for the better . Maybe I read into the ending what I wanted to read into it , but maybe that's the point . Perhaps those who think this movie has nothing to say have given up already on the state of the world , while those of us who find in it a happy ending are those who will continue to refuse to accept that a world governed by panic and fear is acceptable . " Children of Men " makes a nice companion piece to this year's " Little Children , " another downer that ended up being one of the biggest feel-good movies of the year for me . It's so refreshing to find that there are directors who want to do more than simply wallow in gloominess , and actually offer solutions even as they highlight problems .
573921	4532636	76759	10.0	The Boy Who Loved " Star Wars "	A long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away . . . . . There was a boy who was only two years old when the original " Star Wars " film was released . He doesn't remember first seeing the movie , but he also doesn't remember life before it . He does remember the first " Star Wars " themed gift he got . . . a shoebox full of action figures from the original set . He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be . But years later , he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received : another box full of action figures , ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection . It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed , Anakin Skywalker , stopped being produced and carried in stores , and how this boy went for about ten years ( until he got into college ) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets ( don't ask . . . it's a Northern Illinois University thing ) . I can't review " Star Wars " as a movie . It represents absolutely everything good , fun and magical about my childhood . There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases , birthdays , summers and winters growing up . In the winter , my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth ( I was always Han Solo ) . My friends ' dad built them a kick-ass tree house , and that served as the Ewok village . They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it , and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home . I am unabashedly dorky when it comes to " Star Wars " and I think people either just understand that or they don't . I don't get the appeal of " Lord of the Rings " or " Star Trek " but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of George Lucas's films . I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time . Every time I put them in the DVD player , I feel like I'm eight years old again , when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of Anakin Skywalker . Grade ( for the entire trilogy ) :
574138	4532636	39689	10.0	The Best 40s Noir	There's nothing wrong with " Out of the Past . " It is hands down the best film noir to be released in the 1940s ( even better than " Double Indemnity , " high praise indeed from me ) , and it rivals " Sunset Boulevard " and " Kiss Me Deadly " as my favorite noir of all time . Robert Mitchum plays a regular Joe , quietly living an ordinary life in some out of the way sleepy American town , whose criminal past catches up with him and refuses to let him go . It's reminiscent of last year's " A History of Violence , " and explores some of the same themes as David Cronenberg's film : Can we forget the past if the past doesn't want to forget us ? Mitchum delivers a spectacular performance ; his craggy , mournful face is the very picture of a man who knows he's living on borrowed time . Jane Greer is the sizzling femme fatale who has his number . And Kirk Douglas appears in an early performance as a cold-blooded crime boss . What else can I say about the movie other than it's virtually flawless . Stark , moody cinematography ; haunting score ; terrific , sharp dialogue . This is one of the most quotable films ever . A don't miss .
574111	4532636	25878	10.0	An Unbeatable Pair	Watch out Fred and Ginger , Hepburn and Tracy , Bonnie and Clyde , because Nick and Nora ( or should I say Powell and Loy ) are hot on your tails as all-time great screen couple . " The Thin Man " was the first film to team up William Powell and Myrna Loy as famed sleuthing team , not to mention husband and wife , Nick and Nora Charles . A film like this could only have been made in the 30s - - I don't think there's a scene where Powell doesn't have a martini in his hand , and the movie's filled with those sarcastic bon mots that defined 30s screen comedies . Don't even ask me to summarize the plot , because it doesn't matter . The whodunit aspect of the movie is beside the point , and I didn't really care who the killer was , or indeed if the killer was ever even caught . What matters here , of course , is watching the chemistry between Powell and Loy , which practically melts the television screen . William Powell was a sort of Clark Gable with an edge . He looked remarkably like Gable , and he also had that droll way of delivering a line , but he wasn't as much of an everyman as Gable . Myrna Loy is absolutely adorable , one of my favorite actresses from this time period , even though I'm still convinced she was never really used to her full potential . Her appearance in this is as close as any film maker ever came to taking full advantage of her sex appeal , cuteness and comedic flair , but even at that she too often takes a back seat to Powell . And of course special mention must be made of Asta , giving one of the best performances ever delivered by a canine in a motion picture . The later films in the " Thin Man " series weren't ever able to recapture the magic of this first installment , but that would be a difficult feat for any movie .
573644	4532636	404203	10.0	A Highly Unusual and Exceptional Film	Can there be such a thing as a feel-good movie about marital infidelity and suburban ennui ? If so , then I believe this haunting , powerful and superb new movie from Todd Field may be it . A feel-good movie was not in the least what I was expecting from this , based on the trailers and on Field's prior film , the astringent and depressing " In the Bedroom . " And it's not like I left the theatre feeling the need to break into song . But unlike other films about the stultifying atmosphere of suburban America , and the prisons so many people seem to make out of their domestic worlds , " Little Children " ends with a distinct feeling of hope and optimism . In other domestic dramas , the characters are frequently unlikable , and they appear to drift through their worlds allowing things to happen to them without taking any responsibility for themselves . In " Little Children , " Field does not present us with a handful of caustic stereotypes , but rather with a cast of actors who create warm but flawed human beings . These characters don't drift through life . They have things they care about , and they want and feel that they deserve some of the small happinesses that all human beings have a right to . But they also screw up , make bad decisions , act irrationally . What saves them , and the movie , is that in the end they all wake up , realize they're chasing dreams , and decide to make something of the lives they have rather than the lives they think they want . I thought this was a hopeful message , and one that carries with it a tremendous impact in this post - culture , when the safety nets on which we've built our existences have been ripped out from under us and we're left trying to make sense of a scary world . This film , in its closing moments , states outright that there's no time like now to begin taking control of our own worlds and making of them what we want . The best weapon we can wield against an uncertain future are our children , who can learn from our mistakes and make something new rather than simply repeat an endless cycle . As for the acting . . . . . Kate Winslet shines as Sarah , the suburban mom who doesn't fit in and embarks upon a reckless affair to fill a void in her days . Her performance is one of those small triumphs of acting , in which Winslet builds a living , breathing human being from the ground up through a series of subtle and thoughtful choices . Patrick Wilson , such a limp noodle in the screen version of " The Phantom of the Opera , " is pitch perfect as Brad , the stud who attracts Sarah's eye . And the other actors take full advantage of their smaller roles : Jennifer Connelly as Brad's loving but distracted wife ; Jackie Earle Haley as the film's most tragic figure , Noah Emmerich as an ex-cop who takes homeland security into his own hands ; and Phyllis Somerville , who has a couple of beautifully heart-breaking moments as the mom of an outcast . The screenplay is thematically elaborate . There's hardly an element of one character's storyline that doesn't find a parallel in the storyline of another . The theme of parenting is of course central , but beyond simply focusing on the responsibilities parents owe their children , the film goes deeper and examines how parents ' behavior affects their children and the extent to which parents can change the world for good or bad through what they hand down to the children who inherit it . A bracing , fantastic film .
574486	4532636	20629	10.0	The Beauty of a Butterfly	There are few moments in film history as moving as the last shot of this film , when a soldier fighting in the trenches of World War I is able to shut out the carnage around him to focus on the unlikely beauty of a butterfly that has landed only inches in front of him . The power of this image is an example of what set this film apart from all of the movies that had preceded it and ushered in a new era of sophistication in the art form . " All Quiet on the Western Front " is one of the first movies to feel like a movie . The camera takes part in the action : it moves in and out , frames people in close up . Some of the most memorable images come when the camera tracks along with the soldiers as they charge the enemy trenches . And though sound in cinema was in its infancy , this movie makes terrific use of it . Compare this movie's version of combat to the films that would come out ten years later with the outbreak of WWII , and it almost takes your breath away with how ahead of its time it seems . Easily one of the best war movies ever made , and one of the best movies ever made , period .
573843	4532636	469494	10.0	The Only American Masterpiece of 2007	Once in a very rare while ( all too rarely , alas ) I leave a film instantly convinced that I just experienced an enduring classic in real time , and that's how I felt after watching " There Will Be Blood . " It is an amazing film with a performance at its center that defies description , and I haven't been as energized or excited over a new release since last year's " Children of Men . " I've always liked Paul Thomas Anderson , even at his most over indulgent ( " Magnolia " ) , but he's never seemed as mature a filmmaker as he does here . Where other Anderson films have sustained one long fevered pitch and burnt themselves out in exhaustion , this film is restrained and disciplined ; it builds slowly and inexorably to a powerhouse conclusion . Like nearly every Anderson film , it's a love it or hate it movie . It's virtually impossible to have an indifferent reaction to it . And I imagine the ending will be one of the most divisive aspects of the film . I , for one , thought it ended perfectly , and suspect it will be a long time before I get the film's final image and line out of my head . No review of this film is complete without mentioning Daniel Day-Lewis , who is nothing less than a force of nature at its center . His performance is so good it's scary ; what he does in this film can't even be called acting . I've seen other performances this year that I greatly admired : Tommy Lee Jones in " In the Valley of Elah , " Ryan Gosling in " Lars and the Real Girl , " Viggo Mortensen in " Eastern Promises . " But Day-Lewis seems to be working in a completely different stratosphere than these others . In Daniel Plainview , the oilman who's eaten from within by greed and a lust for power , he has created a villain that's one-dimensional yet extremely complex all at the same time . Plainview should be a boring character , because he's so single minded in purpose , yet Day-Lewis makes him endlessly fascinating . And was I the only person who actually liked him a little bit ? In a world full of hypocrisy and men telling one another what they want to hear the better to take advantage , Plainview is refreshingly honest and straightforward , no matter how abominable he may be . He's like the American system of free enterprise taken to its monstrous extreme . Though set in the past , the film is one of the most relevant I've seen this year . The battle over economic and religious domination is obviously one that rages today . Religious and corporate institutions differ only in their methods - - both are driven by a lust for power and control . And to top it all off , Johnny Greenwood provides one of the most unique and sensational scores to grace a movie screen in a long time . I can't say enough good things about this movie .
