442233	819382	89927	1.0	This isn't Mike Tyson , this is Woody Allan	It poses as another epic boxing movie but it boils down to a piffle . I can't believe the positive comments this piece of garbage has received . Is there no end to our lack of taste ? It's a " guilty pleasure " only in the sense that having a dominatrix snap a wet towel at your bare buns in a guilty pleasure . Rocky goes through his usual homey and decidedly low-tech training routine , schlepping a huge log up a mountainside , carrying it like a yoke across his shoulders . ( Oh , Lord , let us hope this wasn't intended as a religious allusion . ) Dolf Lundgren , who cannot act , is a sullen Aryan monster . He's given a lousy haircut , in case we might not get the point , and even sports a black mouthpiece in the ring , in case we missed the haircut too . Stallone almost always has non-Latins in the role of the heavies . A couple of African-Americans , an Irish gang in Paradise Alley , a Nordic here , an Eskimo there . I wonder if he knows exactly what he's trying to tap into , what tribal animadversions are oozing out of his cortical sulci . He practically converts the Soviet Union to capitalism at the end . And all those years we were sending people like Louis Armstrong and Benny Goodman around as Goodwill Ambassadors . Let's see . Drago - - great name ! - - can land a punch that packs 2 , 000 pounds per square inch . That's 131 . 5789474 times the force of gravity at sea level . And Rocky comes away from that final bout looking put upon . And all I have to do is look in the mirror to see what gravity alone is doing to my face ! Watching this - - this - - thing - - I couldn't tear myself from the screen , any more than I could pass a highway accident without gawking at it . What an execrable piece of movie-making crap .
442117	819382	50622	2.0	Slightly Revolting	A helicopter with three Navy officers , led by Jock Mahoney , and the requisite woman reporter aboard , Shawn Smith , gets caught in bad weather over Antarctica and must land through a heavy cloud layer to find they are at the bottom of a volcanic valley . But wait a minute . This is not just ANY hot , steamy tropical jungle in Antarctica . This one is really old , inhabited by plants beasts that disappeared millions of years ago . It is also inhabited by the sole survivor of an earlier expedition , Henry Brandon . The half loco Brandon has the part necessary to repair the Navy's damaged helo - - a " push-pull rod " - - but he's hoarding his equipment because he wants to trade what they want for what he wants , namely the shapely Shawn Smith . And who can blame him ? I mean , ten years ? ( The fact that Henry Brandon is reputed to have been gay adds a shiver of irony to the plot . ) Well , everyone is attacked at one time or another by prehistoric dinosaurs but they allsurvive and escape , including Brandon who has come to his senses at the last moment and discovered his humanity . Brandon isn't much of an actor . He's probably best known for his role as Scar in John Ford's " The Searchers . " ( " You speak good Comanche . Someone teach you ? " ) But his modest talent doesn't make him conspicuous in the context of this film . The other performers are no better . The most interesting cast member is Jock ( nee Jacques ) Mahoney , a stunt man raised in Iowa , and one of the best in the business . Among other memorable acts caught on film , he did the spectacular leap down the staircase onto Robert Douglas's villain in Errol Flynn's " The Adventures of Don Juan . " His name ranks up there with Canutt , Eason , Perry , and Dar Robinson . Not that Mahoney is muscle bound . You don't need to be a body builder to be a stunt man . You need to be lithe , professional , competitive , intelligent , and you to be completely lacking a sympathetic nervous system . The men and women who do stunts don't have to be good actors , as Mahoney proves here . They're a proudgroup - - can I generalize like this ? - - but not snooty . They don't feel they're humbling themselves if they hang around with the extras , as I know from experience . Mahoney was a parent to Sally Field . I don't like going on like this about stunt people but there's so little to say about the movie . The monsters are gaggingly cheap . The first shot we get of them is two ordinary monitor lizards , blown up to dinosaur size by photographic legerdemain , and they're tearing each other to pieces , literally . These are big animals and here they are throwing themselves around and chewing on limbs and heads . We can see the ripped skin . Nobody can claim that no animals were harmed in making this movie . I found it a little disgusting . The other minatory dinosaur is a T . rex - - and it's a hoot : a man dressed in a flabby plastic suit dragging a tail behind him . Another monster never lived - - a kind of gigantic pumpkin with tentacles . It eats a cute little mammal . I don't think it's a tarsier , though Mahoney the expert calls it such . Still , they got the time and the animal reference right . At least , I think the Eocene tarsoids lived about 60 million years ago . I was certainly happy to see the five humans get out of there at the climax . It meant the end of the movie .
443094	819382	106527	2.0	Narcissists	A depressing tale of a middle-aged man and teen-aged girl who have an affair , presumably , after which the girl shoots the guy's wife in the head , so that the girl and the guy can get married , or at least live together , happily ever after . It's based on the real events surrounding Aimee Fisher and Joey Buttafuco . She's played my Alyssa Milano , in probably her most demanding role , and the car mechanic is Jack Scalia . What a tawdry tale . A narcissistic pedophile and a spoiled pretty nymphomaniac . Lots of sex , intrigue , conflict , some violence , all rather disgusting , which is probably why three independent TV made-for movies about the case hit the TV screens at the same time . This one is definitely from Butaffuco's point of view . The poor guy loves his wife and children ( sob ) and never touches this succulent nymphet . Fisher is plumply overdeveloped , more than simply enticing , bursting her seams , and she's the aggressor and the liar in the tale . Buttafuco is the innocent victim . Right . No ex coke addicted , pumped up , self-admiring Italian philanderer would dream of laying a paw on this fawning young creature . Man , is he put upon . Our eyes water at the narrative . Aimee lies to her family and tells them that Joey gave her herpes . Then tries to murder his wife . And all this time he's nothing more than a cheerful , loving , family man and upright citizen , aghast at all the terrible things he's accused of . Did he fund this movie ? The other two made-fors took quite different points of view , depending on who was backing the production and which particular participant in this disgusting tale was doing the endoresements . Utterly revolting garbage , which the public ate up . Alyssa Milano is a beautiful young woman . Anyone who wants to see her en deshabille should rent " Kiss of the Vampire " or whatever it was , far sexier , and less repugnant simply because it is more mindless . This movie actually has a point of view . It could have skipped the sleazy plot and just shown us Joey pumping iron in a gym and Aimee coupling in some stranger's back seat . An insult to the public viewer , who gobbled it down with relish .
443079	819382	76150	2.0	Utter schlock , even by slasher standards .	It's a murder mystery cum slasher movie built around the goings-on at a Catholic church . The little girls are lined up backstage for their appearance at their first holy communion . Brooke Shields , the last in line , is strangled and her body stuffed into a window seat and set afire . That's the good part . The audience gets to see the killer too , but he or she is all dressed up in an oil slicker like the Gloucester Fisherman and wears a halloween mask of a smiling young girl . Suspicion is immediately cast on another young girl , Alice , and for good reason . She showed up late for the service , is seen coveting and hiding a veil that may have belonged to Shields , and owns an oil slicker , a mask , and a butcher knife . Also , boy , is she a waspy thing , insulting , shrieking angrily at everyone , especially her critical aunt , ridiculing a tenant in her apartment house who is morbidly obese . This obese guy is great . He can't act but he looks perfect , with his shaved head and goatee . He listens to scratchy opera records and mopey old torch songs , keeps a room full of kittens , and doesn't clean up his apartment . I suppose the opera and his effeminate tone are designed to suggest his sexual orientation , but then he puts moves on the eleven-year-old Alice , which simply confuses things . I guess he's polymorphously perverse . But , if the truth be told , you hardly notice the confusion because in fact the marginal utility of his sexual orientation is so low . The confusion is already so bountiful that , following Weber's law of just-noticeable-differences , the guy's homosexuality makes hardly a dent . During some of the killings , the violins shriek exactly like those in Hitchcock's superb " Psycho . " I won't go on too much longer . The murders multiply . Father Tom , at the church , is the only guy we can possibly identify with . He looks the part and sounds reasonable . There's blood all over the place after the initial strangling . Alice's aunt goes , Alice's estranged father goes ( I think ) , the fat guy goes , Father Tom goes - - all bathed in blood . I was sorry to see Brooke Shields get it so early , and in her first movie too . But I didn't believe she was eleven years old . I believe she's never been eleven years old , but that she's always been a middle-aged midget , parading her cuteness around like Shirley Temple did before her . Wild horses couldn't drag the identity of the murderer from me , but I will say that the reveal comes as a shock . It's rather like Thelma Ritter turning out to be the murderer in " Rear Window . " And there's just as much motivation , which is to say none at all . To cap it off , after the murderer is apprehended during mass , Sweet Alice leaves the church , stunned , and on the way she opens a bag she's been carrying and therein lies - - a butcher knife , which she partly withdraws in the most sinister fashion . What this is supposed to signify is , well , there are some things man was never meant to know , and this is one of them . As a minor carp , I didn't particularly like the way that Catholic liturgy is put on display as if this were all a freak show . The mass is in Latin ( gosh ! ) , the communicants are seen from Father Tom's point of view with their tongues hanging out , and there are other grotesqueries , such as religious icons made to look like the garish and spooky figures in Madame Tussaud's . What a meretricious kettle of fish .
443434	819382	409182	2.0	Down Into the Sea in Ships .	In the original " Poseidon Aventure , " ( 1972 ) we saw something original - - a handful of survivors exploring an upside-down ship , searching for an exit through the exposed bottom . There was something eerie and unsettling about seeing familiar surroundings vertically reversed . The men's urinals and the toilets hung from the ceiling , the galley ranges still with their gas flames lighted and burning overhead . I didn't see the next remake or sequel or whatever it was ( 1979 ) but I did make it halfway through this one and it isn't even fun to look at . A view doesn't get a sense of being in a capsized ship but instead in a giant junkyard with mammoth objects strewn about . Disorder , yes , but not insanity . Whatever small poetry there was in the original is lost in this dumb remake which is no more , really , than a special effects extravaganza . We've come a long way in the 35 years since the original was made and nobody is more aware of that than the people who put this monstrosity together . If there were any gruesome reasons for death left out in 1972 , that's taken care of here . A huge generator plummets through the deck overhead and takes out Kevin Dillon , the wisecracking , drunken villain ( a figure absent from the first version ) . Dangling cables electrocute passengers spectacularly . Fried bodies float about in the water . The editing is lightning fast . The cuts that may ordinarily be measured in units per minute must here be measure per second . The target audience was weaned on computer games , MTV , and CocoaPuff commercials . No acting can be discerned among the cast of slightly past-their-prime professionals like Kurt Russel and Richard Dreyfuss , nor among the inexpensive younger cast members , but then none is called for . Any auditions must have called for not much more than an agonized scream . I kept waiting for something to happen , something human I mean , something besides gushing water and underwater people banging on stuck hatches . Why didn't the babes at least remove their hampering outer garments if they're going to swim through all that sharp , entangled garbage ? They had the good sense to do that in the original . And if Stella Stevens in the original had something on besides her underwear , at least there were Pamela Sue Martin and that blond in short shorts . Here ? Not a chance . If you're into untrammeled sea water , noise , quick cuts , screams , and heroic children you might want to watch this . Or - - and this might be more constructive - - take a shower . Actually , when they make the next remake , I hope the rogue wave catches the ship and tears it apart at once , drowning or disarticulating everyone aboard . The movie will then be five minutes long .
443302	819382	175526	2.0	Virgins , Look Out .	This piece of meretricious trash is hardly worth reviewing but having sat through half of it , the voices that have just taken over my mind compel me to say a few words so here goes . A mysterious slasher in a small town is killing all the virgin high school students - - boys and girls alike , but mostly girls - - by dismembering them with a knife that manages to make metal-on-metal sounds even when it's being waved around threateningly in empty air . I'd like to know more about that knife . Word gets around the school and the girl decide to remove themselves from the endangered species list by throwing a group orgy in which they all get deflowered by guys with spiked hair and a taste for hash . I never realized that any modern high school had so many virgins . They come in droves . The , umm , heroine , the not-beautiful but still cherubic Brittany Murphy is chased through the darkened hallways and classrooms of an unnecessarily unlighted school in which a big meeting of the PTA is being held in the gymnasium . The mad slasher captures her , flings her to the floor , and flips up her skirt ( not too high ) to begin carving the word " virgin " on her thigh , but he or she is interrupted by the timely arrival of the police . Why is this girl named Brittany ? I mean , that's evidently the real name of the actress , or at least her nom de theatre . Nobody became a Brittany until about five years ago . The other names aren't much of an improvement : Amanda Anka , Bre Blair , Beatrice Bush , Terry Ballance , Mark Joy , Margaret Moister . What the hell is this , Andy Warhol's Factory ? Brittany Murphy , eschewing the group grope , decides to seduce her fave squeeze in his bedroom . She strips off her top and sits on top of him , kissing him and whispering " harder . " He comes up with something like , " I wanted it to be different . " She spurns him , dresses , and leaves the room with an insult hanging in the air . Make no mistake . ( I love that phrase . ) Make no mistake . This is played out in all seriousness . Oh - - a few wisecracks and sex scenes but the chief theme here , the leaking substance that links the episodes , is blood . There are gallons of it . Scenes of torture too , for aficionados . It isn't that I object to movies about high school students . Some of them are cute ( " Clueless " ) and others are occasionally perceptive ( " Pretty Persuasion " ) . But this is nothing more than prime schlock . There is a scene in which Murphy and her high school English teacher quote T . S . Eliot together . Sure .
442815	819382	963794	2.0	Ruins is right .	I don't know . What happens when a film like this is produced ? Do they start OUT to make another meretricious horror flick , making sure they hit all the necessary marks - - innocent kids partying , high hinks in isolated location , mysterious threat , resentful autochthones , exploding head , half-naked woman , something crawling under the skin ? Only this time , somebody suggested they might as well do it while on an Australian vacation since nobody was going to put any effort into it anyway ? If you find this appealing , then you've probably seen it in other , better configurations . The beginning is okay . A group of college kids have a drunken party on the beach of a Mexican resort . The next day they team up with a young German tourist to visit some ruins that his brother is digging up . A pick up truck drives them to the bushy and desolate wasteland . Native Mayans show up shouting unintelligible orders and warnings and finally start shooting arrows at the terrified youngsters and wind up blowing off half the head of one of them . The kids retreat to the top of a Mayan ziggurat where things only get worse . The German kid falls down a hole and breaks his spine . The vines turn out to be sentient and malignant . And then - - well - - so it goes . Nothing wrong with the direction , which is at least functional if not in any way innovative . And nothing wrong with the performances either . All the kids do a reasonably professional job . Laura Ramsey as Stacey ( are they still hanging that albatross of a name around the necks of helpless baby girls ? ) is beautiful and sexy . Joe Anderson as Mathias , the German visitor , has a slyly crabwise control of his German accent . Queensland does an equally good impression of Mexico . And Jena Malone as Amy is really quite good , much better than this material . What are they doing in this by-the-numbers goose-pimple-raising junk that overflows with blood and horror . Who enjoys watching a handful of nice white rich kids get slaughtered ? I wouldn't go so far as to press for a moral , but can't the film at least have a REASON for being ?
442537	819382	272575	2.0	For specialized tastes . Very specialized .	Nastassja Kinsky is easy to look at , and the performances aren't bad , and that's about it . Now , if you're going to make a science fiction movie about some weird stuff going on in town , some conspiracy or secret , there are a couple of ways of approaching it . You always begin with a normal person , as this movie does with Kinsky . And there should be someone else around who behaves normally , so that the hero or heroine can have someone to talk things over with . Katherine Ross , in " The Stepford Wives " , has the bosomy , candid Paula Prentice to talk to , until Prentice became part of the problem instead of the solution . Alternatively you can have the entire town act normal until its residents one by one become creepy , or a group become , let's say , unusual . See " Invasion of the Body Snatchers " for an example of the first kind , and " Village of the Damned " for the second . In this remake , the entire town resents Kinsky from the moment she first drives into it , even before they can possibly know who she is . Actually , she's the school's resident psychological counselor , which puts her in the position of being nosy and turning the town's resentments into full-blown hatred . We know she's resented from the first few minutes of the movie when the director has carelessly positioned the extras so that they all stand with their hands on their hips , glaring at her . Does she get help from the school's nurse ? How about the school's principal ? Are you kidding ? This raises an interesting question right off the bat . If no one in the town wants a snoopy school psychologist , then why did they hire one ? I have it on now in the other room . Somehow it was mistakenly included in a box of DVDs someone sent me . I won't watch it until the end because I don't care what the town's secret is . I imagine , though , that , since this is a remake of a cheap science fiction film from the 50s , and because the cover tells me so , that a monster appears courtesy of special effects . The appearance of a modern CGI monster is , I take it , the chief reason for the appearance of the movie . I can't think of any other reason . Who would enjoy it ? I think lots of kids around 10 or 12 would get a kick out of this undemanding and commercial pap . And , meaning no disrespect , I imagine some adults with a taste for cheaply done science fiction movies with slobbering creatures killing off characters would also enjoy it . Not my cup of tea though . Not a soupcon of originality . Can't speak for everyone .
442473	819382	804461	2.0	There is Nothing New Under the Gun .	I guess someone reckoned it was time to resuscitate the " Death Wish " movies that began in 1974 , but the similarly title " Death Sentence " had to be updated , and for good reason . This is not the late 60s or early 70s when urban crime rates were triple what they'd been just a few years earlier . The dangers of urban life were very real . Statistics don't begin to tell the story . In the neighborhood I lived in , adjacent to the University of Pennsylvania , every Mom and Pop store , every shop , had been held up at least once , with the owners " looking down the barrel of a shotgun , " as one tough old lady put it . The deli owner kept a loaded gun under the counter . The liquor store would periodically acquire one or two bullet holes through its plate glass window . I knew girls who had been raped twice on campus . I was burglarized three times . Every building was decorated with graffiti . Now THAT is a crime wave that Charles Bronson could fight . The muggers and vandals and robbers were anonymous . The threat lay over the city air like an acrid odor . But the young men responsible for that disorganization were baby boomers in their prime . They're now in their 50s and 60s , so things have quieted down . Donc , the writers must now make the story personal . The son of an executive , Kevin Bacon , is killed in a gas station robbery by one of those integrated gangs one so seldom finds in real life . Pursuing a lead he sniffs out , Bacon confronts one of the gang , who is accidentally killed . Seeking revenge , the half dozen other goons ( all Goth skinheads dressed in black and sporting tattoos of barbed wire on their faces ) make several attempts on Bacon's life and finally wound him , kill his wife and shoot their other son . Bacon stumbles out of the hospital and buys four guns from an illegal dealer . There is a final shoot out between Bacon and the gang in an abandoned hospital or something . Guess who is the lone survivor . Kevin Bacon is a far more versatile actor than Charles Bronson was but it doesn't make any difference here . I couldn't identify all the ripoffs that made up this thing of shreds and patches . In addition to " Death Wish " , there's " Dirty Harry , " of course . Bacon buys a huge , stone-heavy magnum . " Guaranteed head remover , " comments the dealer . The climax is almost , but not quite , a shot-for-shot remake of " Taxi Driver " . Bacon is even wounded in the neck from behind . The gun-buying episode is ripped off from the same source - - Bacon fondles the guns and practices with them like Robert DeNiro - - but without the style or the wit . Implausibilities abound . The white-collar executive deliberately attacks and takes out an armed and brawny skinhead , beating the crap out of him and finally killing him . One of the gang marches into Bacon's office and thrusts a package into his hands , snarling , " This is to let you know that you won't die alone . " Bacon stares at the rudely wrapped box for a moment , then sets it on his desk and proceeds to open it . Would you do that ? It's a brutal movie and its ugliness is enhanced by the photography , which uses techniques I don't have the vocabulary to describe . All the images are tinted , mostly a ghoulish green , like a garter snake's belly . Some are blood red . The images are sharply defined so that we can easily make out every whisker stippling a man's chin , every bead of sweat during tense moments . A wide angle lends is used for some close ups , turning the face into that of a malign dolphin . Gun freaks should love it , and so should kids of about , oh , say fourteen , plagued by high testosterone levels . Maybe there are a lot of them around because the user rating is pretty high . If there is a market demand , we should prepare ourselves for " Death Sentence II " and all the rest of the crap that degrades our screens these days .
443450	819382	47559	2.0	Magnificently lousy .	Four people ( Denning , Crowley , Grey , and Reeves ) meet by accident on the streets of a city that has been emptied overnight of people , except for a few dead bodies . They learn from a newspaper that the city has been invaded and evacuated by everyone else . The cars have been disabled , so the four refugees hole up in the suite of a hotel , making do with candles , beer , and canned food . There WAS a fifth member of the group , a witless little character , but he ran out into the street and was rayed to death by a wandering robot . The invading army , as it turns out , consists entirely of these robots with their death rays . They're impervious to bullets and can destroy airplanes , presumably with the same rays . A gun-toting evil murderer invades the hotel sanctuary of the survivors and puts moves on Crowley ( who has fallen in love with Denning after knowing him for only a few hours ) . The resulting fight sees Grey killed and Denning wounded before the burly Reeves manages to strangle the killer . The scenes of the survivors are inter cut with scenes of the requisite military and scientists trying just as hard as they can to devise a means of disabling these robots . They finally succeed - - surprise ! When the robot army is exposed to sound waves of a certain frequency , it " cracks their cathode ray tubes . " ( Your television set is a cathode ray tube . ) The army comes to the rescue at the last moment , too late , alas , to save Reeves but soon enough to whisk off Denning and Crowley . A cheap and boring movie , I found it almost impossible to watch . Well , sometimes the cheapness can't be helped . A budget will stretch only so far , as we all must know . But this thing could have been written and acted by members of the robot army , who look like they're made of Lego's or like unusually angular Gorts , although we only see one of them at a time . The dialog sucks . The plot is unoriginal . The special effects might better have been suggested than put on display . The logic of the plot is terribly flawed and the direction careless . ( Carefully pruned , it might have been a decent episode of The Outer Limits . ) I'll give just one example of a jarring lapse of common sense . The vicious murderer is holding the others at gunpoint and Grey suddenly remembers where she saw him before . He's the guy that murdered that hooker on Skid Row ! That's right , admits the evildoer . His picture was all over the papers . They'll be looking for him on every street corner , Denning observes . Not if I slip out through the sewers and get out behind the enemy lines , the murderer sneers . The entire city has been evacuated and is now occupied by indestructible robots who kill people and repulse the military with unknown rays - - yet they'll be watching every street corner for some nobody who killed a hooker ! Santa Clause could waltz past the army without interference under these conditions ! Well , another example . At the very beginning , Crowley wakes up to find the city empty and she wanders the streets . She stumbles across a dead body and Richard Denning at roughly the same time . They introduce themselves and explain where they spent the previous night . Minutes of frippery go by while neither asks the question : WHAT HAPPENED ? It could have been good , even with the inexpensive sets and the second-tier ( but seasoned ) actors . As it is , it's rather a painful experience except for those who really enjoy cheesy SF movies , and there seem to be legions of those . The producer , the late Herbert Cohen , provides an audio commentary on the DVD and he seems like a good-natured guy . He's generous with his credits and he didn't mind if people laughed at the crummy effects when the picture was released and he still doesn't mind .
443237	819382	50610	3.0	Inexpensive tale of energy wars .	Jeff Morrow is Leslie Gaskell , Barbara Laurence is Vera Hunter , and John Emory is Hubbel Eliot . Along with some ancillary Air Force personnel and a comic geek , they are in charge of a super-secret underground laboratory on the West Coast . Morrow is thrilled when he discovers a meteor passing through the atmosphere but nonplussed when the meteor decides to take a dip in the Pacific Ocean and emerge as a fantastic machine on the Mexican coast . Nobody knows what this colossal , blocky structure is . Obviously it's some kind of carpentered artifact because it's all made up of right angles with a kind of bald sphere half visible on top . It turns out that the machine , dubbed Kronos , is from some far-away planet and has been sent here to rob the earth of energy . You see , here on earth , we have learned how to convert matter into energy , but on Kronos ' planet they have figured out the other half of the equation - - how to convert energy into matter . And now they're running out of energy on the other planet . Are you taking notes on this ? Good . Maybe you'll be able to fill me in on some of the scientific questions raised by Kronos ' mission . For instance , if Kronos ' builders can convert energy into matter and vice versa , why don't they just convert a little of their own spare matter into energy instead of sending elaborate machines to earth to extinguish LA's lights ? But it's doubtful the writers could explain it either . Reversing the polarities of two antenna is described as an " anthropic conversion , " which means a " towards-human change " , which doesn't make sense . But it doesn't seem that any of the science makes sense for that matter . The diagram that Morrow draws on the board has the current going in the wrong direction , from positive to negative . There's a problem with Kronos ' locomotion too . It marches along the coast , threatening " populated areas " ( read Southern California ) , but it has no joints in its two or three legs . These stumps just thump slowly up and down , squashing some people . The film doesn't make much of these squashed people . They're shown as Mexican peasants , so maybe they don't count for too much . The USAF also drops a hydrogen bomb on Kronos - - while it's in Mexico , mind you . Nobody raises an eyebrow . Not much acting is called for and not much is given . Jeff Morrow has a distinct and resonant voice , great for radio or for TV voice overs . His face is less expressive . He has only one expression , no matter what the situation is - - a tight smile , as if he's having his picture taken at the Universal Studios Tour . Barbara Laurence had a fine , golden quality when she made " Street With No Name " a few years earlier . She was a slender seventeen-year-old as Richard Widmark's wife . Here , her grooming and demeanor reduce her to the level of B-movie actress , though she's still beautiful . It's always good to see Morris Ankrum in one of these movies . He's made so many , I get them mixed up . On the whole , the film comes across as flat , I'm afraid . ( There are some nice shots of a B-47 in flight , though . ) The sets reveal a low-budget enterprise . That's not necessarily bad in itself , but there's nothing to make up for the barren settings . Little tension in the script , no directorial display , and little effort put into the performances . You might get a kick out of it - - a relaxed high - - because this is distinctly unchallenging . It's just that there are so many better films of the genre out there .
443095	819382	111255	3.0	Look , Ma - - I'm Inna Movies !	When I was a teenager , a high-school freshman or sophomore , I recall having contests during gym classes with the other guys . We'd stand in front of the mirror with our arms folded across our chests in such a way that each hand was lodged under the biceps opposite , and then we'd nudge the muscles forward to see what we might look like with seventeen-inch-circumference upper arms instead of the pitiful fourteen-inchers were were cursed with . Some twenty years ago I was amazed to see a photo of Sylvester Stallone , a fully grown man , solemnly pulling the same stunt in some publication like " People Magazine . " " The Specialist " is an expanded version of that photo of Stallone's already expanded biceps . I can't think of many other movies in which we see more of the hero's nude and preposterously overblown bronzed body than we do of the heroine's . ( Too bad , Sharon Stone hasn't much more than that to offer . ) Stallone just can't seem to keep his clothes on . He's always taking showers , walking around with towels around his waist , doing exercises , lying back on a bed with some kind of purple kimono coyly draped over his groin while Stone kneels worshipfully at his feet and runs her hands up his oh-so-muscular legs . I wonder if Stone was jealous of all Stallone's nude scenes . The plot ? Oh , the plot . Well - - you've got me there . You see , Stone wants to knock off these bad guys who killed her parents . And Stallone has a history with James Woods ( the only performance in the movie worth watching ) . The whole business is engineered by old Rod Steiger who is , we can tell , Hispanic because he pronounces " you " as " chew " . Woods has something to do with the police , and with the bad guys as well . And Stone seems to have more than one motive . And - - well , I don't want to spoil it for you . In fact , I couldn't , even if I wanted to . Nice photography of Miami . Fireballs like the Fourth of July at Olympic Park in Irvington , New Jersey . The score is lifted wholesale out of " Body Heat . " Enjoy ! If you can .
442501	819382	366598	3.0	Small Town Floozie Fights Injustice .	I hate to sound unappreciative of any artistic endeavor , or unreceptive to stories of the weak being mistreated by the strong , but I can't help wondering how much longer they'll be grinding out scenarios that fit this template : Helpless young woman is raped ( or otherwise abused ) by a man ( or men ) of greater social worth - - here a doctor , there a famous high-school jock - - and she complains to the authorities . The authorities try to shake her off , not take her seriously . Nobody believes her . The community ostracizes her . She persists bravely and in the end manages to bring her abuser down . You can get a variation of the scenario by substituting some giant corporation for the rapist . ( Cf . , " Erin Brokovitch " . ) I understand that this is " based on a true story " and that poetic license must be granted - - but , wow . The characters could have had numbers attached to them and the narrative lifted , still throbbing , from some handbook for genre movies . In this case , the victim is a single mother in a small Canadian town . The abuser is the snooty doctor with the English accent who gives her a general anesthetic to treat some minor injuries she received in a fight with her boyfriend . While Estella Warren , as Kimberley , is all doped up , the English doc takes advantage of her to rape her . Kimberley brings a civil suit against the doctor ( John Hannah ) , but docs have a full hand of Aesculapian authority . ( Not to mention lots of money and charisma . ) Who , other than a doctor , can tell the President to go to bed for a day and drink plenty of fluids ? Man , that's POWER . The story then follows the usual trajectory , so ostracism is next . The whole community seems to STARE sullenly at her , wherever she goes . The close-ups we see are of faces that are old and wizened and , if they're women , they wear harlequin glasses like unto a Roz Chast cartoon . Kimberley must finally pack up and leave town , while the doctor luxuriates in his own sham aura of victimhood . In the end , the Great Physician seems to contract a case of terminal stupidity . At about the time Kimberley is read to give up , he pulls the same stunt with another young woman . The case now - - finally - - goes to court , and during his testimony the doctor explains that he tampered with evidence , obstructed justice , and committed perjury in SELF DEFENSE - - because he couldn't allow his reputation to be ruined by a young slut . I needn't reveal the verdict . Estella Warren is pretty good as the victim . She's no tiny prey , but a tall , full-bodied , and abrasive young lady . She doesn't know the meaning of the word " simper . " She turns into a positive pest , and that's what the role calls for . John Hannah , as the doctor , comes across as not much more than another seasoned actor . He's not bad , but he doesn't bring anything extra to the role . The direction is competent too . There's no confusion about where we are or who's doing what , and no unnecessary displays of directorial razzle dazzle . The story is told without unmerited garnish . If I've been critical of the movie it's not because I think incidents like this don't happen , because they certainly do . Some examples have been caught on tape . It's just that we leap to the conviction that it happens SO OFTEN . My guess is that it's a pretty rare event , given everything that an established physician has to lose . So we can't claim there are thousands of sneaky doctor / rapists out there . Maybe there are , but we have no way of knowing . We need , I think , to also keep in mind that accusations are easy to make , and that they're difficult to refute because you can't prove a negative . ( Prove to me that you did NOT rape this girl is a little like saying prove to me that there is no God or that there are no such things as UFOs . It can't be done . ) And in judging cases like these , we need to bear in mind that it's enjoyable for some people to be a victim . ( Not to be victimized , but to be thought of by others as a victim . ) A certain moral weight attaches to the role . People sympathize with you and treat you with greater kindness , as with mothers in Munchhausen-by-proxy syndrome . There are two ways to get people to carry you around . One is to be powerful enough to order them to do it , and the other is to collapse . The role of victim involves a collapse in the face of irresistible social or physical forces . Given the weaknesses and the over-familiarity of the plot , though , this is a reasonably well-done movie , with Estella Warren particularly good . I don't see much point in recommending or not recommending it because , if you're fond of these kinds of films , you've seen it already in one form or another . They're kind of like the many action movies that star Schwarzenegger , Willis , Van Damme , Stallone , and the rest . If you like one , you're liable to like all .
443074	819382	454970	3.0	Treacherous swarthy foreigners chase rich white kids through jungle .	At least it can be said that this movie isn't as bad as the disease that is its namesake . For one thing , it's shot in the outback of Brazil , although it is no essay on the wilderness . For another , the chief villain is given a reason , however silly , for having his horde pursue these fun-loving kids through the jungle . He hasn't just escaped from a loony bin . He wasn't dissed by these kids in high school . And he didn't just wake up one morning to find himself a maniac . No . He's chasing and killing these kids because they are gringos , whose people have stolen his country's valuables for centuries , and he wants THEM to give a little back , in the form of all their bodily organs which he intends to harvest and contribute to the People's Memorial Hospital in Rio . It's ludicrous , I told you , but at least it's a motive . There is also a brief , disturbing moment early in the film after the kids have reached the beach and a fiesta is in progress . One of the guys runs into this curvaceous young Brazilian chick and they have a lot of fun while she tries to teach him how to pronounce her name properly , both of them laughing playfully . The next time we see them , it's morning and she's taking money from his wallet and getting into her swimsuit bottom while he watches groggily from the mattress . " Hey ! You're taking money . I thought this was all fun . " And she replies matter of factly , all business now , " No , it was not like that . " Ah , what illusions we create for ourselves . It's a good scene . For another thing , there are a couple of genuinely suspenseful moments , many of them underwater , woven into the fabric of this otherwise rather typical slasher flick . The photography is pretty good . The direction doesn't get in the way of the story . That's about it for the bonus points . The skeleton of the plot is one we've all seen before . A couple of kids on vacation want to have fun and visit a remote seashore village in Brazil , where the natives steal all their goods , and they are forced to try to walk back through the bush with this madman waving his scalpel following them . One of the kids is disarticulated on screen , a gorgeous babe who is only half unconscious from the anesthesia , so we can all share her pleasure as she is sliced and diced to death . The lunatic begins with her kidneys . He goes into the retroperitoneal sac through the front because her belly is so plump and ripe looking , and so that throughout the procedure we can get occasional , tasteful glimpses of the dying girl's naked breasts . There's a whole bath tub full of blood . The remaining kids manage to escape . There are face-smashings , shootings , drownings , impalements of feet , a gratuitous scalp-stitching , and I think some amputated fingers and a bottle of acid in the eyes . But I'm not sure about that last one . I was busy with something and the dialog was in Portugese . The concept of " continuity " is pretty much thrown out the window whenever it becomes inconvenient . Here are these kids being chased by maniacs , having witnessed brutal acts , and they discover an underground pool that just misses the splendor of the Blue Grotto on Capri . What do they do ? They forget all about the threats , the danger , and splash each other playfully and exclaim over the beauty of the cavern . Their lives are in danger , but , gee , this place is AWESOME . There's nothing new about a pursuit through exotic territory . That's why it's so familiar on screen and in literature . ( " The Most Dangerous Game , " etc . ) But this movie is obviously designed to appeal to the same audience as slasher movies , and that gets past me completely . What sort of appeal lies behind seeing an innocent person screaming and being slaughtered ? It can't be the shock value , not any longer . There must be some pleasure in witnessing the scene itself . But for whom ? And does it have any consequences in real life ? Surely , the neural pathways are altered in SOME way . If nothing else , it desensitizes viewers to the idea , so slaughter becomes less repulsive . ( The scientific evidence is that violence in the media is one of many factors that influence the level of violent crimes in the community . In many border cities , Americans and Canadians watch the same media in theaters and on TV , yet the American cities invariably have much higher murder rates . ) It seems strange that we can tear our hair out over certain scenes of explicit or simulated sex , yet allow movies like this to be seen by crowds of cheering and laughing kids . Well , it seems strange to me , anyway . As slasher movies go , this one is a cut above the rest , but it's not , by any measure , a particularly good movie .
442841	819382	100133	3.0	Exciting , didactic , pastiche .	This film has virtually nothing to do with the original " Memphis Belle " of 1944 , except I suppose that it involves the crew of a B-17 on their final mission . Maybe a few duplicate shots . That's about it . Two notably good things about it . One is that it gives us the feeling of what it's really like to be aboard a bomber in combat , or at least I think it does , never having been in that situation myself . They've convinced me though . On the ground the big airplane shivers from the vibration of the four engines like a Magic Fingers mattress . Everyone and everything jiggles at high frequency . We see bombs armed in flight . We see what the target looks like through the bombardier's sight . We feel the airplane lurch upward after the couple of tons worth of bombs are released . And we catch some of the dynamics of the crew . The bombardier has posed as a doctor . One waist gunner plays grab with the other's religious medallion . The other outstanding feature is the aerial photography , or the computer-generated images . Everything is so crisp , so clean , so sky blue , except for those black blotches ahead and the drab B-17s droning their way to and from hell . It's extremely exciting too , once it gets off the ground . That's part of the problem . Everything we see happening to the Memphis Belle happened to one 8th Air Force bomber or another , but never to the same airplane on the same mission . It's as if all the very real dangers facing these fliers had been put into a duck press and slapped onto the plot . If you've seen airplane-in-jeopardy movies before , you'll find little that's innovative here . A man dangling out of a hole in the fuselage ( twice ) . The near miss after takeoff . The sight of a buddy's ship going down . Should we throw the badly wounded radio operator out with a parachute over Germany in hopes that his life will be saved ? We're running out of fuel - - throw out everything we don't need . Let's sing Danny Boy for good luck . The whole film is derivative , from the beginning to the end , and everything is spelled out in big letters like a child's alphabet book . The opening lines from a PR officer tell us a lot . " Let's see now . We have a guy from Omaha , then an Irishman from Boston , " or something like that . The PR officer ( John Lithgow ) turns out to be a knucklehead ( " Baloney is my business " ) but that doesn't stop the writers from using him as the crudest tool of exposition . The opening scene , a drunken party , is ripped off from " Das Boot , " only here , in case you didn't know why the party was taking place , it's made plain for you . " I don't want to die ! " one drunk screams at the sky . In " Das Boot " Wolfgang Peterson let you figure out for yourself that despair led to drunkenness . His writers thought you had enough in the way of inferential abilities to pick it up . These writers don't . The dialog is ludicrous , right out of a 1944 funnybook . Captain to crew : " Let's make this our best bomb run ever . " Crew member : " Right down the pickle barrel ! " Captain : " You bet ! " Captain to crew : " Boys , nobody ever said this was gonna be all fun and games . We're here to do a job so let's do it . If we don't do it somebody else will have to come back and do it . " There is virtually no swearing . It's alright for us to see a man's blood and guts splattered all over the nose , but we aren't allowed to hear a terrified or a wounded man shout or or even . I think the most nauseating bit that's included in this movie , from the point of view of poetics , is the damned dog . See , as in all other bombing movies , the ground crew are waiting tensely for the return of " their " airplanes and crew . They play desultory softball to distract themselves but glance into the skies from time to time . They have a dog . The dog mirrors the anxiety of the men , skulking around and looking worried . At one point he flops onto his belly , his chin buried in his paws , and seems to be looking airward . I think this is known as the pathetic fallacy . At least the writers left out the conflict of crew members about some mixed up love affairs back on the ground . Well - - the film may serve its didactic purpose anyway . Kids who don't know why this war was called World War TWO may learn something from it . ( A student at a well-known university once complimented Barbara Tuchman after a lecture on World War I , saying he'd always wondered why the other was called WWII . ) For the rest of us , if you can stomach that dog you can get through an exciting and well-photographed war movie .
441952	819382	119709	3.0	Ka-Poof !	I guess I've about reached satiation on noisy and implausible action films . They have to have some sort of sheen in order to make any impression at all . " The Bourne Identity " was interesting because of the location shooting , the direction , and the performances by the leads and the support . It also had a cool narrative thread . Just who IS this guy Bourne anyway ? This one isn't interesting . Keenan Ivory Wayans is an honorable Marine gunnery sergeant on death row , recruited by a rogue military group to be framed for the assassination of the first lady - - a dangerous woman who is a card-carrying member of the ACLU and who favors veterans ' benefits . He manages to escape the roof-top set up and rushes to the safe spot from which he calls his handlers , an army group headed by the viperous General John Voight with a Southern accent . The dialog in the scene is lifted straight out of " Three Days of the Condor . " " Are you damaged ? " " What ? " " Are you injured ? " " No . " " Stay where you are , Poker One , I'm going to bring you home . " Something like that . It hardly matters . The rest of the film contains no big surprises . As is customary , a beautiful young woman is swept up in Wayans ' attempts to save himself and expose the plot . Jill Hennessy is certainly pretty enough but the only thing that would have saved her here would be a gratuitous nude scene - - maybe a couple of them . Wayans himself is an imposing physical presence but his thespian talents are modest at best . There are some good guys on Wayans ' side . The CIA team led by Paul Sorvino is trying to help him but they're blocked and frustrated by one or another circumstance . But why go on with this . If you like action movies you'll like this production with all its bangs and zipping bullets and exploding time bombs and screeching cars and sprinting bodies and venal villains and some guy cold-cocking another by bumping foreheads in violation of every one of Newton's laws of physics - - you'll like this one too . You know something ? I made fun of this flick by citing Newton's laws ? Well , actually , this movie exemplifies one of them . All dynamic systems eventually run out of steam and grind to a halt - - unless they are fed some inventive energy from an outside source . How about another action movie , just like this one , except it stars nothing but kangaroos ?
442482	819382	457433	4.0	Routine Mystery .	Halle Berry is a reporter whose best friend is murdered . She pursues the case over the objections of her editor , who finally fires her . ( If she were a cop , this would be the scene in which she hands over her gun and badge . ) With the help of a friend at the paper , Giovanni Ribisi , she goes undercover and is hired by the prime suspect , Bruce Willis , a nasty executive at the firm where Berry's friend last worked , a guy who exudes menace and embodies a kind of serpentine lechery . It's a pretty tough slog for the viewer . The writers have done what they could but not much of interest happens , despite some trumped-up suspense plug-ins . Red herrings abound . Everybody turns out to have secrets of one sort or another and they are uncovered , one by one , except for those of the murderer . Halle Berry looks delicious , though she is no longer the cherub of yesteryear . That's not necessarily a disadvantage . The part calls for a fully grown and determined woman , not a cutie pie . Her acting is seasoned and pedestrian . Giovanni Ribisi is a good nerd but occupies so much screen time that we KNOW he's more than just a helping hand . Bruce Willis is toggled into his minimalist mode , which renders him more ominous but less human than in his usual action movies . I prefer him dashing along steel girders with a pistol in hand . The ending calls for a suspension of disbelief uncommon outside of frank delusions . I don't know why this is so dull . Maybe - - at least in part - - because no one has yet found a way to make participation in internet chat exciting .
443240	819382	43625	4.0	Pedestrian .	Pretty decent cast - - John Garfield , Wallace Ford , Selena Royle - - but the film is no more than routine . Garfield is a gangster who has just committed a payroll robbery . On the run , he takes refuge in the working-class apartment of a girl he just met , Shelley Winters , and her family - - Mom , Pop , and kid brother . His identity is discovered by the family and he quietly takes them hostage , holding a snub-nosed . 38 on them . But what's he going to do with them ? How is he supposed to get away with the dragnet out for him ? Mom and Pop are quietly repulsed by him , but Winters is attracted and evidently spends the night with him , intending to accompany him on his getaway . He sends her out to buy a car with part of the payroll money but comes to believe she didn't buy the car . Instead , she's betrayed him to the police . In the end , she's forced to shoot him at the doorway to the apartment house . He looks surprised , says , " You never had no love for me , " stumbles out the door , only to discover before he collapses that she'd been true to her word . There sits the car . And Garfield plops into the rain-filled gutter . Mostly - - throughout the movie - - they talk . Then they talk more . Then they go on talking more . Garfield's character emerges as embittered and cynical , self pitying , angry at those who have betrayed him all through his life , beginning with his mother . But he's not very smart . He allows the family to go out in order to show up at work or run errands , as long as he has one member at home for a hostage . While the rest are absent , in a burst of generosity and hope , he has an elaborate turkey dinner prepared . When they return , he beams with pride and tells them to dig in . But they remain silent , and Mom produces some left-over stew , which they proceed to spoon out without enthusiasm . " I don't get it , " says Garfield . " What's the mattah with the toikey ? Ga head - - cahve it up . " Pop tells him solemnly , " This is our dinner . The turkey is YOUR dinner . " Garfield is dumbfounded . " Huh ? Oh - - I GET IT . " ( Finally . ) It could easily have been a radio play , still popular at the time ( 1951 ) or a live TV show from Playhouse 90 . The budget is low and the story skeletal . Usually they find room for remarks about how this is going to be the hottest day of the year or something . Here the patter is limited to remarks about the future , about good character , about responsibility , and they lead nowhere . I usually find John Garfield's performances likable - - another lower-middle-class guy from New York - - but never magnetic . Shelley Winters usually gets panned but I don't know why . She's never bad , and often better than the script calls for .
443201	819382	373450	4.0	Weak murder mystery .	It starts off alright , as a kind of " Goodfellas " dealing with a Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis team in the 1950s . Kevin Bacon's narration , both matter-of-fact and kinda surprised , carries the viewer along in exposing the corrupt underbelly of the Martin-Lewis bonhomie . But the problems crop up rather quickly . What can this movie tell us about Martin and Lewis that Jerry Lewis hasn't told us already ? But that's the best part . After the introduction to the phoniness behind the act and the telethons , it turns into a routine murder mystery , and a not very interesting one . No - - more than just not very interesting . Absurd . Ionesco couldn't have developed a more bizarre plot than one of the comedy team , a homosexual in the oppressive 1950s , murdering an exploitative young woman and the team , in a panic and still stoned on Tuinal , packing her body in a crate full of lobsters and ice and shipping it from Miami to Newark . The only thing is - - the butler did it . I swear I'm not making this up . Most of the acting is okay , except for Alyson Lohman as the central figure . She looks fine and should have a flourishing career in afternoon romantic dramas . Kevin Bacon is pretty good . As he's aging , he's acquiring some character . His face seems now kind of monkeyish but not at all unpleasant , and his voice is a deep-throated kek kek koaxx koaxx . When he tells his story in voice-over we can believe him . As an entirely , though , the movie isn't worth watching . At least I don't think so . Others might . It's not so poor as to be either insulting or funny . It seems more confused than anything else .
443571	819382	109198	4.0	You have already seen it .	Madeleine Stowe , as Cody Zamora , is a hooker who shoots a man in self defense . Being what she is , that is to say , not being Mother Teresa , she doesn't generate much sympathy in this rough-riding town and the good citizens decide to hang her . " Get on with it , " she tells them with defiant contempt . They're about to do just that when three other young women of dubious repute rescue her at the last minute and ride off . In pursuit are a variety of justice seekers , including Pinkertons and other law types , one or two of them , such as Dermot Mulroney and James LeGros aren't too bad . On the trail they run into the Jarrett Gang . Some of the bad girls , and some of the pursuers as well , carry baggage with them related to the Jarrett Gang . There is a violent shoot out . Now , we must note here that the writers weren't reaching too far for original character names . The leader of the girls is Cody Zamora , whereas the leader of the Gang is Kid Jarrett . I'd be surprised if the writers hadn't seen James Cagney in " White Heat " as a gang leader named Cody Jarrett . At least there were no Wades or Coles or Lukes or Matts , although there was a bad guy named Yuma , which is pretty bad . In fact , though , all four of the bad girls could as easily have been men , or more easily . They WOULD have been men back in the 1950s or 1960s . But then I suppose the Jarrett Gang wouldn't have had an opportunity to treat Drew Barrymore to a lesson in Tough Love . At that , though , this is a BIG improvement over " Westward the Women , " with Robert Taylor as a sadistic wagonmaster hired to cart a caravan of would-be wives out to a female-starved Western outpost . Taylor consistently treats his wards like dirt and actually whips some of them when they don't work hard enough . There's nothing original here except the gender of the four leads . There is some suggested nudity but no simulated sex or anything else to pique one's interest . They just seem to have rounded up four popular actresses and thrown them into a well-worn dusty rut . The climactic gunplay is lifted straight out of " The Wild Bunch " , as are a couple of slow-motion gunshots . No reason for it , except that it had been done before . I thank the whole tenor of the pitcher is captured when there is a scene of them four hoorah gals a-settin ' around the camp fire and a-havin ' a peaceful chat . All four of them is exquisitely dressed and unimpeachably groomed with modern hair styles and make up in full panoply . Not a hair out of place , y'know ? But the make up department has very carefully brushed a comely taupe area on one cheek or a smear of raw sienna across some otherwise impeccable forehead . That's dust and dirt from the road . They been on the trail fer quite a spell . And they talk like they just graduated from Wellesley . ( That's this here classy college back East , kids . ) Not a single " g " is dropped at the end of a word like " nothing , " or - - as we rawboned cowboys like to call it - - " NUTHIN . " How can writers and directors be so careless , so contemptuous of viewers ? Or maybe I'm mistaken . Maybe they have a different audience in mind . But if so , what is it ?
441957	819382	139809	4.0	Paper or Plastic ?	I have to admit that this one got beyond me from time to time so these are just some impressionistic shards . It's about a software engineer ( Craig Bierko ) whose boss ( Armin Mueller-Stahl ) is murdered , sliced to pieces in fact , one night in Los Angeles . The police come to suspect him . Bierko feels that the clues to the recent murder lie in the past , in Muehler-Stahl's youth , in the Los Angeles of 1937 . Mueller-Stahl has been working on a device that sends the user back in time and it's possible that he has been leading a double life , one in modern LA and the other in 1937 LA . When the subject's consciousness is transferred , it loses awareness of itself and assumes a different , time-specific identity that does not remember the future . Bierko has his friend and co-worker ( Vincent D'Onofrio ) send him back for two hours . ( Anything more than one hour is dangerous . ) The machine has a glitch or something and before you know it , there are several people switching back and forth from past to present . One of them is Gretchen Mol , which is nice . It's all pretty jumble and confusing to me and seems mainly an excuse for magnificent displays of computer-generated images , bars of laser-light like , and all the expectable rest . Splendid production design , though , in both parallel worlds . Mueller-Stahl is always reliable and Gretchen Mol is a beautiful young woman . Craig Bierko has a talent that seems made for TV . His performance is adequate but illustrates the limits of his range . George Clooney with a voice that squeaks when it expresses excitement . Very good performance by D'Onofrio with a face and demeanor that could go either way . Have you seen the Los Angeles of 1937 in " Chinatown " ? ( If you haven't , then do so at once , I implore you . ) It's all sunny and bright . Fewer cars , less smog . Fewer people , more orange groves and flowers . This 1937 Los Angeles is dark and wet , just like the Los Angeles of the present . Everything is dark . Even the offices of the software company are dark . I'll bet the surgical teams are performing laparotomies in total blackness . Well , maybe a candle or two . It's just a silly fad , this dark lighting . In fact , considering that another movie about time travel and solving a murder was released about the same time , " Deja Vu " with Denzel Washington , I'm beginning to wonder if time travel to solve a murder isn't liable to become a craze in and of itself . It would be nice if it were a genuine possibility . I'd like to go back to 1937 Los Angeles myself , but only with my present consciousness intact , so I could buy up all the real estate and discover Lana Turner in Schwab's Drug Store . Things being what they are , however , and being stuck in the present , I gave up on this about half-way through . It simply didn't seem interesting enough to hold my attention . They blew too many opportunities . For example , there ought to be multiple instances in which people are transported into the past and bump into different fashions of quotidian life . Isn't anyone surprised at the price of gas at the pump in 1937 Los Angeles ? Where are the bottles of milk with the cream separated at the top ? I'm listening to the climax now , from the other room , and it's full of the kind of gun shots that suggest the time-travel mystery has turned into a more familiar shoot ' em up , but in any case I doubt that the sun is shining , wherever and whenever the characters are .
442066	819382	100114	4.0	Macho Man	Have you ever wondered why these guys - - Seagal , Stallone , Willis , et al - - manage to survive all those gunfights in which they're outnumbered ? I think I've got it figured out . The enemies always miss , and the hero doesn't . Here , Seagal has a pistol and outshoots a half dozen heavies firing at him from a few feet away . One of the heavies has a shotgun . Or maybe two of them have . It doesn't really matter . There could be a thousand shotguns blasting away at him and Seagal would still emerge with his ponytail intact . And when it comes to mano a mano combat - - forget it . The evildoers may or may not be armed with swords or knives or blunt object but Seagal , with his skill in aikido or tempura or sushido or play-do or whatever it is , brushes them aside with a few dismissive blows . Not only is he a master of these outré skills but his physical strength is Herculean . More than once he snaps somebody's long bones as easily as we would break a toothpick . One he breaks a guy's SPINE over his knee . I'll tell you something . ( I'm getting into the spirit of the film here because Seagal uses that line , " I'll tell you something , " several times , along with , " What's that supposed to mean ? " ) These guys are fully deserving of extinction in any good Xenophobe's handbook . They are all black , speak with unintelligible Jah-MAY-can accents , wear dreadlocks that look in dire need of a shampoo , they torture and murder with aplomb , and - - here's the worst part . They're unchristian . That's right . They practice voodoo . Actually the voodoo element comes close to being the most interesting element of the film . They got the constituents of the ritual pretty well - - cigar smoke , rum spitting , the sacrificial chicken . They only left out the possession dance in which the spirit rides the dancer . They should have read Metraux on voodoo . Otherwise the plot adheres to the usual conventions . What was done to Jaqueline Bissett by the voodoo-practitioners in " The Deep " is done here to a friend of Seagal's . What was done to John Wayne when he was stuck between trucks in " McQ " is done here to Seagal himself . At the movie's very opening , when Seagal makes a brief speech about having seen too much pointless violence in his DEA career so he's now happily retired , and when we are introduced to his friends and family , I tried to keep track of his affiliates to see if I could pick out which ones would be horribly murdered or maimed to generate his quest for revenge . The acting doesn't really require much comment . But Charles , the Jamaican cop , played by Tom Wright , is really pretty good . Wright has considerable range . Here , he's an associate of dubious allegiance , rather sinister . But in " The Pentagon Wars " he has a comic part that he underplays perfectly . The Jamaicans never flew as movie villains . I don't know why exactly . It's a small movie market . And if you go to Jamaica stick to Montego Bay . However , if you want to see Jamaican voodoo drug dealers as heavies , and if you're in the mood for another typical-standard action flick , this should be a satisfying view .
443471	819382	55539	4.0	Courtroom drama lacks focus .	I don't know what the novel was like but it was probably tighter than the script for this movie . I'll have to lay out the plot , which is essentially this : four American GIs stationed in Germany rape a teen aged German girl ( Christine Kaufmann ) . They are charged and court martialed , defended by Kirk Douglas and prosecuted by E . G . Marshall . ( How many times has E . G . Marshall played a lawyer ? Sometimes I lull myself to sleep trying to remember them all . ) The townspeople are bursting with animadversions aimed in one direction or another . The local whores hate Kaufmann for her superiority . Her father is a demanding local official who is all agitated because the family is involved in a scandal and he wants to see the four GIs get hanged . A gossip is happy to testify against Kaufmann . Her boyfriend , a student , loves her and wants to run away with her . A dirty old man who lives across the street from Kaufmann kind of likes her because she sometimes does morning exercises nude in front of her open window . Kirk Douglas interrogates her and he comes to like her too . She's so innocent , so young , so einbeisslich . Of course it is Douglas's job as defense counsel to attack her story if she gets on the stand . Douglas practically begs Kaufmann's father to talk her out of testifying but the old fellow is dead set on seeing GI blood . Once on the stand , she's torn apart by Douglas's questions . It's revealed that she took off her " bikini " - - a word that somehow emerges as some kind of infernal device - - and was nude when the soldiers raped her . Douglas shows the bathing suit to the jury , yanks on it , and it comes apart almost as easily as Kaufmann's poise . She winds up sobbing with her hands over her face and later offs herself . Despite Douglas's vicious defense , the boys don't get the death penalty Kaufmann's father wants , but they get beaucoup years in Leavenworth at hard labor . It's tragic . She loses her life . Her father loses his beloved daughter . The GI's lose their freedom . Douglas has lost the case and is ridden with guilt . But somehow it doesn't quite come together , at least for me . No individual scene flops , and there are no major errors , but neither does any character develop in any way . Nobody seems to learn any moral lesson . There's very little suspense in the trial because we don't have much doubt about how the participants will act . So what do you come away with ? Well , small German towns can be as full of intrigue and empty-headed hatreds as small American towns . And those damned Yanks ought to go back home or pick on more available targets . As an old German proverb goes , " Bad boys rape our young girls but Violet gives willingly . " ( I'm afraid only electronic technicians will get that piece of word play . ) And , wow , is Christine Kaufmann a superior kind of seventeen-year-old girl . Whew . Of course no decent guy would want to rape her but in real life it might be fun to squeeze and pinch her if she let him . Or the other way around . Overall , it's pretty depressing . The black-and-white photography is stark and edgy . The sound seems to crackle with hostility . Makeup is uninspired . All of the men have short hair , thoroughly moussed , causing them to look as if they'd been groomed to appear in a film . And while Douglas isn't bad , Christine Kaufmann gives a weak performance . And then there is that tin-pan-alley theme song , " Town Without Pity , " played repetitively with and without the sodden lyrics . But these are all personal judgments and , although I found the movie not very rewarding , others may find it more interesting .
442653	819382	104265	4.0	Confusing story of murder , insanity , and assorted mishigas .	Kind of disappointing considering the cast - - Richard Gere as the morally upright but slightly imprudent psychiatrist , Uma Thurman as his " caterpillar " patient , and Kim Basinger as Thurman's seductive older sister . To help him understand Thurman's problems , Gere seeks out Basinger and winds up making furious love to her on their first date . She , lamentably , is married to one of those madly jealous Circum-Mediterranean gangsters who has muscles all over his body as well as inside his head . This is Eric Roberts in his perfect evil greaseball mode . He dominates Basinger and makes her do humiliating sexual things , which is perhaps his one good idea before she bashes his head in with one of his own dumb bells . It seems she suffers from " pathological intoxication . " One sip of alcohol and she becomes violently psychotic , and she had innocently sipped some alcohol-based cough medicine just before the homicide . Gere helps her shape her defense , brings in his friend , Paul Guilfoyle , to serve as her lawyer , and she gets off with a " not guilty by reason of temporary insanity . " Thereafter , it gets twisted . A little too twisted if you ask me . By the end I could hardly tell who was who or what was what . It's pretty thrilling all the way through . It's just that it doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense . Thurman's character begins in cahoots with her sister , then betrays her , then helps her escape from the funny farm , then takes over her identity and murderous quirks . Why ? It would take more than a shrink to determine that . It would require a mind reader , or maybe a seasoned screenwriter . It's nicely acted and the location photography is picturesque - - San Francisco at its most glorious , the Golden Gate Bridge is in every other shot . But it's cheap too . The director uses every cliché in the book regardless of whether they fit together . The climax at the top of a light house has the railing collapsing and Gere dangling over the crashing breakers - - in a howling electrical storm the likes of which Point Reyes has never seen . The fulsome orchestral score belongs to the genus Slasher . And , as I say , the plot is dizzying and at times makes no sense . Okay . Basinger is accused of murder , which she has in fact committed . The only question in whether a condition called " pathological intoxication " exists or not . The prosecution calls an expert witness , a haughty woman psychiatrist with a bony face and a foreign accent . She declares that the condition does not exist except in the minds of defense counsels . Why doesn't she believe there is any such thing ? Because there is no physical evidence . It doesn't show up in brain scans or blood tests . An experienced defense attorney would have jumped all over her and asked if there were any " physical evidence " that schizophrenia exists . There isn't , but nobody can deny that the condition is real . Anyway , in a sense , it's an exciting movie and soothing too , watching cliché follow cliché while common sense flies out the window . Kind of a ritualistic experience , like listening to a familiar but meaningless pop tune .
443175	819382	33149	5.0	Lupino's picture .	A pretty good Warner Brothers working-man flick , recycled though it is , that makes you feel for the poor guys driving those big rigs and trying to squeeze in as many hours on the road as possible . But that's only part of the plot . The main story has the slightly mad Ida Lupino , married to the boss , the good-natured airhead of Alan Hale , falling for George Raft's blue-collar kind of guy , who in turn is in love with foxy and sympathetic Ann Sheridan . Disgusted by Hale , Lupino does a monoxide number on him so she can be free to marry Raft . Raft , however , is an ethical guy and rejects her . Lupino then goes to the police in a major snit and blames Raft for forcing her to murder her husband . At the trial , she breaks down . Raft is freed and takes over the business . All's well that ends well . I wonder how many legal-types have ever seen a witness break down on the stand . Did anyone ever cry , " Okay , I DID it , I DID it . She had it coming , but I didn't mean to kill her . It was an ACCIDENT , I tell you , and ACCIDENT ! Understand ? " Well , that's not exactly what Ida Lupino does on the stand here . Instead , she sobs , " The DOORS made me do it ! " The film is more interesting than it is compelling . Of course we want the good people to survive and flourish , and we want the evil people to suffer and die a lingering death . Lupino's character is not exactly evil , though , which is one of the things that makes the movie interesting . She's a little impulsive and disturbed throughout , and at the end she turns into a complete fruitcake . While we certainly don't want her nefarious scheme to succeed , neither do we want to see someone who's obviously insane suffer more than they are already going to suffer in the days before phenothiazines . No . Lupino has a tough enough road ahead of her in some psychiatric warehouse . We are spared at least seeing her led down the last mile and being strapped in the chair . Warner Brothers ground out dozens of these kinds of flicks during the 1930s , often reworkings of the same plot , and they knew what they were doing . Very professional team at Warner Brothers . Jack Warner worked his major stars half to death and paid them about as much as waiters were paid at The Brown Derby - - and no tips .
441960	819382	41968	5.0	Taut Little Melodrama .	Sensible but dull husband Arther Kennedy and domineering demanding wife Lizabeth Scott are driving through the California night to a party in their convertible . She doesn't want to go , although they've promised to show up , and she nags him until he turns around and heads back to L . A . A car passes them in the opposite direction and , evidently mistaking them for someone else , the driver tosses a bag with sixty large into their back seat . They pull over to examine this unexpected gift . Now , sixty thousand dollars was a lot of money when this movie was shot . Today , of course , I tip the barber half that much , but it certainly stirs up Lizabeth Scott's acquisitive instinct . Her dim bulb of a husband argues that they'd better take it to the police and they argue and a gun goes off and , well , the money winds up in a locker at Union Station and he winds up at the bottom of West Lake . From then on , the trajectory of the story follows the template of Murphy's Law - - if anything can go wrong , it will . Here is Lizabeth Scott with all that stash and nothing to account for except a missing husband , in whom the police show a distinct lack of interest . But then Dan Duryea shows up at her apartment , claiming he's from " the detective bureau " and is simply checking on a convertible with plates similar to hers . Duryea , never a good guy , is the man the money was destined for and it doesn't take him long to twig . He bats her around a little , or threatens to . ( He's always doing that . ) And he more or less becomes her partner when she tells him the truth , but only after he has coerced her into being more " friendly " towards him . Other characters enter the story - - Kristine Miller , who is Kennedy's sister and is the most appealing character in the film , and Don DeFore , who is the brother of Lizabeth Scott's previous husband , whom Scott drove to suicide . Everybody and his brother seems to know what's going on - - except the cops who interpret everything in the simplest possible way so as to avoid any tedious paperwork . It ends with all the loose ends tied up in a ritzy Mexican hotel . I was certainly glad when Lizabeth Scott met her end , otherwise she'd be spending the rest of her life in fancy Mexican hotels instead of the dumps I've stayed in with windows overlooking an alley strewn with crumpled toilet paper and broken beer bottles . The direction by Byron Haskin is only functional but the script , by Roy Huggins , is nice and tight . Very little time is wasted . If the story has innumerable twists and the dialog has little sparkle , there still are a couple of good lines , most of them given to Don DeFore . Scott , though , when she first meets Duryea , asks , " What do I call you , other than stupid ? " ( That's not bad . ) And Duryea tells her , " Don't ever change , Tiger . I wouldn't like you with a heart . " All pretty hard-boiled , as is the story itself . I could never get with Lizabeth Scott as an actress . Dan Duryea is a parody of himself , his skinniness padded out with broad-shouldered , loose-flowing , double-breasted suits . And Don Defore , looking a little chubby and good-naturedly goofy , really belongs in light romantic comedies . But the mystery sweeps you along . We don't find out until more than half-way through where the money came from . And we don't find out what Don Defore is doing in the movie until the final few minutes . Overall the movie has about as much originality as the title - - " Too Late For Tears " . I mean , did someone actually have to think that up ? Or did they just pick it out of a shoe box ? An engaging divertimento if you have time on your hands .
442205	819382	38937	5.0	Only a Mild Shock	Vincent Price , at a time when his career in expensive features was beginning to slide , is a psychiatrist who murders his wife for the love of another woman , Lynn Bari . Price carts the body off in a trunk and dumps it on the rocks to simulate an accident . But the murder has been witnessed by a woman across the courtyard , Anabel Shaw , a delicate looking creature who is expecting the immediate return of her husband , a POW for two years . The husband , Frank Latimore , walks into the hotel room late at night to find Shaw sitting on the " divan " in a state of shock , staring wide-eyed and speechless at the wall . Quick - - off to the private sanatorium of the best shock specialist on the West Coast , who happens to be Vincent Price . What a conundrum ! Price and Bari know that Shaw has seen the murder . If she recovers from the state of shock , she'll blab it all over the place for sure . The only way out is to start her on a course of insulin shock therapy and , during the fourth and final trial , give her enough of an overdose to knock her off . That ought to keep that would-be blabbermouth quiet . This B-grade crime drama is confused in some ways . The writers seem to have known next to nothing about post-traumatic stress disorder or its treatment . And there are multiple ways of getting around the problem without murdering the helpless Shaw . It doesn't start off as a very promising film . The original murder is handled tactfully and isn't enough to send anyone into tonic immobility . Price bops his wife over the head off screen , for crying out loud . But then I found myself gradually drawn into the story , curious about it , rather than gripped by it . I don't know what Price's wife looked like but Lynn Bari is nothing special , unless she and Price conjured up some more than usually exotic stuff when the two of them were not in the presence of the camera . Furthermore , Lynn Bari's role is that of Lady MacBeth , constantly urging Price on to increasingly nefarious deeds . But the pair show absolutely no electricity on screen , so Price's crime passionelle is less than believable . Price is a peculiar actor . He started off in supporting roles in big-budget movies , his mellifluous baritone enriching every film he was in . But he had an even better flair for the comedic than for the dramatic , as in the hilarious " Champagne for Caesar . " Later in his career he was able to blend the two talents in the outrageous rip-offs of Poe and , most notably , in the thoroughly enjoyable " Theater of Blood . " Lynn Bari has the vivacity of a tree stump . Reed Hadley shows up as a polite but too-nosy detective . His face may be oddly configured in some respects but his voice , like Price's , is memorable - - reassuring and authoritative . In the end , Price saves his soul but is captured and , presumably , sent to the gas chamber because of medical ethics and the Hippocratic oath , which begins , " First , do no harm to the movie . "
443286	819382	120749	5.0	Bruce Willis as Loose Cannon Cop .	In this one , the FBI are the good guys , more or less . A little naive maybe , except for Bruce Willis . The National Security Agency ( NSA ) are a supersecret group who plant spies all over the place and want to kill a little autistic boy who has accidentally cracked their top secret code . The NSA as a secretive organization ? There's absurdity for you . Anyway , there are a couple of bad guys within the NSA , led by Alec Baldwin , who follow Willis and the kid around . ( " Gloria " , the original , was a far more innovative movie . ) There are some rather mopey scenes between Willis and the kid but more often the kid is a nuisance , screaming and kicking over minor matters like the fact that he can't play with the buttons on the ambulance dashboard and the fact that his mother and father have just been blown away by a murderer from the NSA . The murderer is one of those guys who smiles a lot but has a cruel face and an even crueler haircut . He uses a pistol with a noise suppressor and is absolutely ruthless . There is also the obligatory young woman introduced halfway through the story and she gets swept up in events . The kid isn't required to do much except scream , kick , look distracted , or chant statements repeatedly . In the last few seconds of the film , the kid gets up from his chair , moves slowly over to Willis , and embraces him . The movie , which has been tottering along trying to stay upright , finally collapses entirely in a shuddering heap . The slam-bang action is predictable but okay . But people are liable to come away from movies like this one and " Rain Man " believing that all autistics are savants , which is just not the case . Both conditions are real enough but they don't always occur together . Autistics aren't usually pathetic and charming like this kid either . They don't need other people , they like to tinker with things or play with glittering objects , and they don't like change . They like predictability , so they'd probably like this movie . It's a fascinating condition and nobody knows what causes it . Anyhow , nobody with any experience demands much of a movie like this . But the expectations , however low , aren't met . Forget this .
443350	819382	37193	5.0	Frenetic Hope Comedy .	This is a splashy Technicolor comedy with Bob Hope as an impersonator on the run , Virginia Mayo as a kidnapped princess , Victor McLaglan as " The Hook " , and Walter Slezak as the ruler of an island that serves as a pirate's rest stop . It should be funnier than it is , and I was trying to figure out why it doesn't come off more satisfactorily than it does . It's certainly fast enough . Everyone seems to be running around , bellowing , and there are explosions and multiple sword fights , and a few minutes of romance . But it's not funny for the same reason that " Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd " isn't funny anymore . It's a child's idea of comedy in that it lacks any sophistication . I don't mean to be supercilious but kids laugh at things that don't demand much of them . Somebody takes a pratfall and a fifth-grader laughs . Kids don't need to know anything other than what they see happening on the screen . What made the Road movies so funny was that there were pauses so that the audience could take a breath while Bing Crosby crooned a silly tune to Dorothy Lamour . And Hope and Crosby were constantly trying to outwit each other in ways both shameless and sly . When they had a friendly embrace and picked each other's pockets at the same time , we could identify with them , or at least with their desires . There was somebody for a grown up to ROOT for on the screen . The Road team had a different set of writers - - Panama and Frank - - and they were better at giving Hope gags than the writers of " The Princess and the Pirate . " Hope is given a couple of anachronistic wisecracks - - " made in Japan , eh ? " - - but they don't save the day because the rest of the movie propels us at warp speed through the ludicrous plot . One of the more amusing scenes is a minor rip-off from the Marx Brothers ' " Duck Soup . " What's missing is the easy banter between Hope and Crosby , the more delicate touches provided for them . ( " Delicate " , here , being a relative term . ) Hope on his own could be hilarious , as he was in " They Got Me Covered . " Danny Kaye was making movies in this period that were just as funny and , like Hope , he always played the same character , but it was a different character : the shy , neurotic schlub . Hope always played the same part in the 1940s too - - the sniveling , greedy , libidinous coward - - but nobody was better at it . Woody Allen borrowed some of Hope's mannerisms for his own performances . If you give Hope the right settings and the right gags he runs with the ball like nobody's business . But this part could have been done by almost any comic actor , maybe Red Skelton . " The Princess and the Pirate " was released in 1944 . Hope had some splendid movies ahead of him . In the 1960s he was churning out one turkey after another . I suppose he must have enjoyed working . He surely didn't need the money by then . When he finally quit , he played golf , continued to make his well-known USO tours to troops overseas , and lived to a respectably old age . Not at all a bad career .
442483	819382	43660	5.0	Woman in Jeopardy .	Valentina Cortese has an interesting face rather than a conventionally beautiful one . Startling eyes - - the right eye looks straight ahead while the left is canted somewhat outward , lending her every expression a kind of fey quality . From most angles her big features are full of bone structure , dominated by an aquiline nose , compellingly ordinary . She has the overall appearance of a northern Italian paisana from the Po Valley . She could be stomping on bitter rice next to Sylvana Mangano . In this film , Cortese is an inmate at Bergen-Belsen and adopts the identity of a friend who dies . Not that this makes any difference in the rest of the story . She might as well be who she claims to be . Anyway , with her new identity , she returns to a Gothic house on Telegraph Hill in San Francisco that she has inherited from a deceased aunt . Her young son - - or rather the son of her dead friend - - lives there with his guardian ( Richard Basehart ) and a strangely distant maid servant ( Fay Baker ) . She and Basehart , after a too-quick romance , have been married , but the moment they move into this cockeyed American Gothic house things seem askew . Basehart has the difficult job of projecting politeness and caring towards his wife without even the underlying hint of warmth . And Margaret , the icy maid , seems to have wandered in from " Rebecca . " The only person Cortese can depend on for honesty and confidence is William Lundigan , in the Kent Smith role . In fact , everybody and everything seems to have wandered into this rather unfocused romantic drama from someplace else . The young kid has a playhouse in the back yard , bigger than the domicile I now occupy . It has a hole in the floor and wall and there is a scene in which Cortese , snooping around as usual , almost falls through to the street half a mile below when she is surprised by the ominous Basehart . I thought surely the climactic scene will involve that dangerous hole , but no . It's never seen again , thrown in willy nilly like so many other adventitious elements . The whole production is a patch work of vague threats , all seen from the point of view of the uncertain and perhaps imbalanced Valentina Cortese . I didn't much care for it . Not so much because it's a mixture of romance , mystery , and drama in which everyone seems to be scuttling around behind everyone else's back , but because little of it seems to hang together . Pretty thoughtless . Others might enjoy it more than I did .
443477	819382	6177	5.0	The Tramp's First Steps	Not much to be said about this Chaplin short . Charlie was introducing the tramp character , it was early in his career ( 1915 ) , he had responsibility for everything and was working like a coolie . So it isn't surprising that " The Tramp " lacks the wit , sophistication , sentimentality , and innovative quality of some of his later productions . ( The sentimentality could get pretty heavy handed . ) The gags are mostly crude here . Charlie hits somebody . Somebody hits Charlie back . Charlie kicks him in the pants , and so forth . Compare this with , say , " The Idle Class " to see what a difference time , intelligence , and talent made . By the way , Chaplin's status in the 1940s as persona non grata in the USA has been attributed to his being a communist / socialist / pinko / subversive / fellow traveling spy ( when in fact it probably had more to do with his fondness for young girls ) , but you'd never know it from this specimen . He takes advantage of just about everyone but Edna Purviance , and he abuses them for the fun of it , even his lessers on the social ladder . At this point , the tramp wasn't exactly a sympathetic figure .
441894	819382	382077	5.0	The imaginary playmate comes out of the woods .	Famke Janssen is no longer the wide-eyed teenager of her early movies but is definitely in contention for the title of World's Tallest Danish Pastry . She's ravishing . Alas , she has little to do except give a bit of good advice to Robert DeNiro's psychologist near the beginning and to show up just in time to save his daughter Dakota Fanning's bacon at the end . Robert DeNiro is surprisingly good in what is for him an unusual role , a quiet , thoughtful , analytical humanistic type . With eyeglasses . It isn't until near the end that he become a somewhat more familiar figure . Elizabeth Shue does very nicely by the part of a sensitive and warm woman , of just about the right age too , who wouldn't mind taking the place of DeNiro's recently deceased wife , which she does too , in a curious kind of way . She's quite attractive with her long curly hair the color of straw , schlepping around that magnificent bosom . No wonder Charlie gets jealous . I'm just throwing in these observation seriatim , trying to avoid an outline of the plot , because the plot take the road less traveled and I don't want to give too many hints . Still - - Charlie is the playmate of ten-year-old Dakota Fanning . He may or may not be imaginary . The acts he performs have real enough consequences and they could NOT have been performed by a skinny little ten-year old , so that leaves only two possibilities . Either this movie has a genuine supernatural element , or one of the apparently normal human beings is nuts . Rolling right along with the performances , and passing quickly over a sheriff who has a disconcertingly suspicious habit of smiling at the wrong times ( such as when querying a possible witness to a murder ) , that leaves Dakota Fanning . A ridiculous name , a splendid performance . Where do they find kids who can hold their own against veterans like DeNiro . She shows considerable range and is at least as convincing as anyone else in the cast . And she has this quirky appearance too . In profile , and with her hair styled as it is in this film , she looks amazingly like one of Lewis Carrol's photographs of Alice Liddel . She has the wide face of a child . Her eyes are like two gigantic marbles , white with big blue irises , that seem barely to be held in their sockets by their lids , which slant outward and upwards like a kitten's . If she can make it through adolescence she may have a future in films . The photography is quite good . It captures the gray overcast and denuded thickets of a wintry northeastern forest . The interiors are neatly done as well , except that the lights have an irritating habit of going on and off for no perceptible reason . Each time they go off , there is a loud BANG on the sound track . Ditto , for each time they go on . In the last scene , even a flashlight flicking on and off emits what seems like a sonic boom . Doesn't leave much to discuss except the plot , does it ? And this movie depends a lot on its resolution of the puzzle it's been posing , so I don't want to reveal it . I'll just say it reminded me a bit of the climax of " The Shining . " In fact , the whole business could have been written by Stephen King . Come to think of it , there's a similar movie written by King , about a writer in a cabin by a lake who - - Well , enough of that . The plot doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense . Why does the daughter treat Charlie the way she does until the very end ? Some misleading slight of hand there , if you ask me . Worth seeing for the performances , the photography , and the easy shocks . It will not occupy a prominent place in anybody's resume .
442839	819382	96087	5.0	By the Numbers	It starts off with an interesting if already familiar problem : How do we dig out corruption in the NYPD when there is so much crack money floating around ? In " Serpico " a Brooklyn narc hijacks the hero off the street and threatens him , saying , " This is serious money . " That's the milieu we find ourselves in here . Peter Weller is a nobody Legal Aid lawyer trying to get his drug-dealing client off because the suspect actually killed in self defense . An undercover cop tried to rip off his drugs and cash in Central Park , shooting him in the process . The opposing prosecutor is Weller's ex-lover , Patricia Charbonneau . Weller enlists the aid of an undercover friend of his , Sam Elliot , in trying to uncover the truth . The questions addressed are important , and the script sounds literate for the first half hour . Someone went to the trouble of ferreting out apt quotes about justice from the New Testament . But after that it goes downhill fast . It's as if somebody had handed in a decent and thoughtful script about the characters , then another party had taken the script and doctored it , putting in a quote from Dirty Harry ( twice ) , a shootout in what looks like Times Square , a funny car chase through the streets of New York ( twice ) , wisecracks in times of mortal danger ( " You drive , I'll shoot . " ) , and finally a rip off of a physically impossible feat from Schwarzenegger's " Commando . " Too bad . Charbonneau and Weller are well matched , each with prominent bony facial features . Charbonneau sounds like Sondra Locke if you close your eyes . Sam Elliot is reliable too , and he demonstrates his range here . At one end , he can lower his face then cock it over his shoulder at someone and offer sage advice with a smirk and a baritone . At the other end , he can chuckle . Peter Weller I've always liked , though he shows his limitations as an actor here . Whatever prompted him to pursue a Master's degree in , what ? , Ancient Civilizations ? And then look for positions as Adjunct Professor at places like Franklin and Marshall and Syracuse University ? ( I've got it . He needed the money a part-time teacher makes ! ) Whatever his motives , I admire him for his intellectual curiosity . Weller's character is no invincible superhero either . When somebody holds a gun to his head he's scared to death and tells them what they want to know . Notwithstanding all that , this isn't a movie designed to appeal to grown ups . There's no point in listing the plot loopholes or loose ends . The evil people are plain evil . The good people are plain good . There's none of the ambiguity of real life . One can only wonder what a yeoman director like Don Seagal or Sidney Lumet might have done with material like this .
442811	819382	97880	5.0	Where's Belafonte when you need him ?	Relaxed - - very relaxed - - murder story , with Denzel Washington as a detective ordered to find and capture his friend so the murder can be rapidly cleared up and the tourist trade flow along liquidly . Halfway through , Washington begins to believe that there is more to the case than meets the eye , and that his buddy will be no more than a scapegoat . Very nice location shooting in Jamaica . If you like reggae , you will LOVE this film's score . There are lots of shots of the beautiful beach . Hey , mon , why you jomp in dee wah-tah faw ? The more desperately seedy areas of Kingston are avoided , as they would be in one of Hitchcock's movies set in an exotic locale . The viewpoint is that of the tourist used to saying in nice hotels , the kind with jacuzzis but no venomous snakes . Denzel Washington handles the accent pretty well without quite shedding his own phones . Sometimes it fades more than others . The other performers don't really have too much to do . Everyone seems to be enjoying himself , as if on vacation . The movie is rather good-natured considering the plot . The white guys tend to be bad , while the local people of color are at worst raffish . Is there still such racial friction in Jamaica ? I don't know , but in the Bahamas the races get along well with one another , as they do in much of the Caribbean . Maybe big cities breed animosities spontaneously . There's nothing truly outstanding about this routine flick , except , as I've noted , the score . It's not especially exciting , mysterious , amusing , or engaging in any other way . It's not a bad flick if you're prepared to let it take you by the hand and lead you along the colorful streets , pointing out sites of interest , suggesting you taste the jerky and try one of those pink drinks in a tall glass with a flower and a paper umbrella sticking out of it .

441967	819382	109161	5.0	Worthy Attempt	This is a somewhat retro TV movie . It probably should have been made some years ago , when many people in the USA were unaware of these issues , basking in fantasies of every man being equal . A black cadet at West Point is victimized , is blamed for it himself , and discharged from the Army . It's hard to figure out what point the movie is trying to make . It certainly isn't that " it takes all kinds , " as the aged Johnson Whittaker says philosophically . Because we only see two in this movie , the simply good and the simply bad . Well , I guess Sam Waterston's lawyer seems like an upright and just man , but even he is revealed as a closet racist at the end . The problem lies almost entirely with the script . It reads as if it were something that won a high school prize in Dubuque . Points that are already obvious are spelled out for us . Points that could easily have been made visually are put into indignant speeches . The dialog wobbles all over place and time and social register . Sometimes contractions ( " won't " ) are used , sometimes they aren't ( " I will not . " ) . Sometimes the dialog is American ( " will " ) and sometimes British ( " shall " ) . Anachronisms are thrown haphazardly into the text . Jackson is made to say things like , " Sham , my a , they beat the s out of him ! " And , " You just don't get it , do you ? " And - - this one's clever - - " Right now the wind is behind your back , but some day it's going to change and all the s you're writing will blow back in your face . " Even that's not enough . Jackson has to add , " Some day you are going to eat your words . " There's no score worth mentioning . The photography is competent . The acting is generally good , despite the miscasting . Sam Waterston is not a stiff-necked hypocrite and crypto-racist . Sam Waterston is Jack McCoy , and Abraham Lincoln , and Nick Carraway . Jackson does quite well in a clunky role , but someone like Morgan Freeman might have projected more thoughtfulness and masked intensity . The actor in the role of Whittaker as a cadet hasn't got much going for him , but Al Freeman , Jr . , as the older Whittaker is professional and dignified , although his final obiter dictum on how the country is doomed if it doesn't shape up soon falls rather heavily to earth . ( It's not Freeman's fault . ) Two performances are outstanding , though , because the actors ham it up delightfully and bring some absurdity to a project overburdened with solemnity . John Glover is a remarkably slimy and supercilious villain . I love the guy in everything he's been in . He never disappoints - - and he's slightly cross eyed too . The other performance , surprisingly , comes from Mason Adams , whose voice you will recognize from commercials . I will always remember and honor him for the deathless line , " And I thought mustard had to be yellow to be good . " He's phenomenal as a Southern racist Harvard-grad lawyer who will brook no nonsense from anybody . Those performances are among the reasons I can think of to see this film . It will also serve to enlighten those who are unaware of the racism so prominent in our national history . It's a sad truth that so many of us still need that issue brought to our attention .
442348	819382	104743	5.0	Which color do you like - - the red or the green ?	Action / thriller about Pierce Brosnan as a troubled but wisecracking FBI explosive expert . There's really nothing much new here , but what you see is pretty well done . It's just another professional genre piece . There is the corrupt senator ( Ron Silver ) who's made a fortune from a crooked arms deal . There is the freelance explosive artist ( Ben Cross ) who has learned how to make an explosive substance out of something that looks , acts , and tastes like water until it is activated by stomach acid , when it throws the victim into fits and turns him into a monster bomb . ( ! ) The senator has been making love to Brosnan's wife , which causes Brosnan to drink too much , but they get together at the end , and there is an African-American sidekick who manages to analyze the explosive water , and when Brosnan is cornered by the evildoers in the senator's kitchen he saves himself by making bombs out of ordinary household substances like Vaseline , acetone , alcohol , arugela , salt , pepper , and a touch of marjoram , and - - well , you can guess the rest . It's interesting to watch a human drink a glass of water , fall into an epileptiform seizure , burst his eyeballs with blood , and blow up , leaving only bits and pieces of flesh and shards of bone behind to mark his passing . Pierce Brosnan is a lightweight actor but a likable one . If Ron Silver were more intense he'd be a black hole . Ben Cross is the kind of villain who - - well , here's a scene . Cross is hurrying through his laboratories and the man who invented the secret explosive is scuttling along beside him , reminding Cross that he hasn't been paid yet . Cross says something like , " Yes , you're right . I owe you . " Then he borrows a pen to write a check and , instead , stabs the natterer to death right through the apricot . Near the end , another henchman is stupid enough to claim he's done his job and is leaving now . Right . Cross plugs him in the back . There's no reason for any of this , except to provide a few more colorful deaths , as if there weren't enough . You might find it satisfying if you're in the mood , but I doubt you'll be surprised at much that happens .
442192	819382	113451	5.0	What's Going On ?	Practically a ideal exemplar of " routine thriller . " Friedkin had a marvelous time in the 1970s , coming up with some original genre pieces like " The Exorcist " and " The French Connection . " All of his work is commercial but Exorcist was gripping because it was so successfully manipulative , and French Connection gave us a cop who was unexpectedly mean and embedded his character in a fascinating mystery story . Here , though , there's not much originality on display . There's nothing wrong with the direction or the performances . ( I think this is the second movie in which Linda Fiorentino makes a phone call in the nude . Rather a nice touch . ) Friedman makes good use of San Francisco locations but some of the scenes do come through as derivative . The first chase through one of the city's Oriental theaters that I can remember is in Orson Welles ' " Lady From Shanghai . " There is also a car chase up and down the city's streets . It will never match the car chase in " Bullett " but in order to make the scene look new the director has these two cars not only racing downhill and being jolted at the intersections on the way down . They actually leave the pavement entirely and rocket into the air . And the chase extends through a parade in Chinatown , a scene in which a couple of pedestrians get flattened . Something similar appeared in a movie directed about 20 years ago by Peter Bogdanovich . Friedkin does open his film with an excellent exploration of a well-appointed house in the city . The camera takes its time examining the tribal masks , the Degas on the wall , while the less outrageous excerpts from Stravinksy's Rites of Spring serve as background . ( We gradually become aware that someone is being murdered off screen . ) It's well done . There's a good deal of realistic gore too , and about the same amount of sex involving Fiorentino . Evidently she likes to dominate the man , tying his hands behind his back and making him do things that only rabid subordinates would do . Her expression during ordinary love making suggests it's more of a nuisance than a pleasure . And we see one murder that has produced about a bathtub's worth of blood and another in which the victim's brains are exposed . I'd better quit now . Old memories are being redintegrated and I can't tell whether they're from a traffic accident , my marriage , or both . But basically the problem is with the script . Instead of a murderer , there turn out to be several murderers , none closely related to the others . A lot of surprises pop out at us in the last few minutes , complicated and with little in the way of groundwork . Some questions are left unanswered . I still don't know who Caruso was chasing through Chinatown . Nobody involved in the film seems to have cared enough to polish this into a more acceptable shape . Too bad .
442264	819382	362269	5.0	Doggie Style	They took the easy way out on this one . Liam Neeson - - who , for the first time , I must judge to be in over his head - - gives us a Kinsey who is a prophet without honor in his own country , a scientist first and always , practically a saint . Beginning as an entomologist he finds himself wondering what EXACTLY goes on in the human boudoir . We have to take into account that this is the mid-40s and nobody knows from sex . What I mean is that many believed that if you did something bad to yourself you'd grow hair on your palms . Things like that . A little outre . And here comes Kinsey . What Darwin was to biology , and Freud to psychology , Kinsey was to the physical and social aspects of human sexuality . He used what are called " snowball samples , " which are what you have when , say , you interview one gay guy and ask if he knows any other gay guys that might agree to an interview , and so on . This is not a very good way to get a sample , but Kinsey was operating in difficult times . Not a good sample ? Nobody else HAD any samples ! The chief source of data on sexuality was " clinical experience , " the province of MDs who brought their own ideas to the discussion . Before Kinsey there was only Van deVelde's marriage guide , the most shocking message of which was that sex was for more than just reproduction , and when you went on your honeymoon don't expect to spend all your time coupling in a locked hotel room . Leave some space for skiing . The more literary among us in elementary school would sneak the guide off the library shelves and furtively skim through it looking for the dirty parts . But overall the movie is rather dull . It's a simple-minded picture of Dr . Kinsey , the ex wasp man . He was not only a knight in unshining armor , although he was that too . He was a pretty weird guy . The movie shows him going about gaily collecting " data " , disinterested and coolly eager , but he had a lot more in the way of personal involvement than the movie suggests . There is a scene in which he is alone with a young man in a hotel room and they both agree that on a scale of one to ten - - ten being completely homosexual - - they're about a three . Then they do something about finding out if that's true . That's all we see of Kinsey the man exploring his own sexuality . However he knew something about his bisexuality before undertaking the study , and he explored it in his adulthood . He got his wife into the picture more than once too . And there were group gropes that grew a little , well , what might later have been called kinky . Kinsey enjoyed himself by tying ropes around his penis with plenty of knots ( in the ropes ) and then tugging on it to the point of pain as well as pleasure . There were times when he went a bit too far and suffered unpleasant infections . I hope I'm remembering this accurately . It's mostly from a profile in the New Yorker from some years ago . Now , the REAL Kinsey sounds like an interesting fellow , whereas this paragon of objectivity is rather a bore . He can't seem to talk about much except how badly we need more information on sexual habits . ( He was entirely right about that . ) But he talks like that at parties too , and it gets repetitious after a while . The movie ends sadly , after a cinematic biography whose trajectory is familiar to most of us . Genius has great idea and devotes his life and his talent to its exploration . He goes too far and alienates others . Runs out of money . Loving wife sticks with him . But we all know that though he may have died thinking he was a failure , his work will long outlive him . The direction is flat , the dialog lacks sparkle , and Liam Neeson has a haircut that only Kim il Chong could envy . What an interesting movie could have been made about this man and his career .
443523	819382	162661	6.0	Voloptuous and spooky .	To tell the truth , I was a little confused by the plot . Yes , it's true . The story that used to be on every high school reading list lost me here and there . I can't remember the original , but did it really include so much detail about family trees and inheritances and local conspiracies to hide forbidden truths ? It's hard to believe that it did . It probably doesn't matter that the story is confusing at times because the cinematography and set design are are so resplendently dismal as to be spooky in themselves . And if the constant twilight , the desaturated colors , the late Fall atmosphere , the general gloom of both the interiors and exteriors don't creep you out , there's always the Headless Hessian Horseman with his flailing blades . ( He twirls them around in his hands like a gunfighter's six-shooters and they have this swishing sound . ) The acting is pretty good too . Johnny Depp seems a little stiff at time but maybe the part calls for it . Christina Ricci looks almost edible with her wide forehead , enormous doll-like eyes , and diminutive splanchnocranium . The supporting players are all just fine , including Christopher Lee , with the exception of the kid who serves as Crane's sidekick . He sounds as if he's still practicing his lines . The story has a couple of false starts . Depp is first set up as a kind of visionary Sherlock Holmes type . He has invented new tools for investigating crime scenes . But none of them is explained and he is seen using them only once , for a purpose we can't define . We expect him , based on this early exposition , which leads to his exile from New York City to Sleepy Hollow , to be a scientific genius . But that's soon gotten out of the way . It isn't long before he meets the Horseman himself and realizes he's dealing with the supernatural . At that point , alas , the movie begins to lean more heavily on the clichés of the slasher movie . People do stupid things that put them in danger , for instance . Having just run away from the Horseman and knowing they are still being stalked by him , two guys stop running , turn around , and stare into the fog to see if their pursuer will show up . ( Huh ? ) The constituents of the slasher movie are always there , lurking in the mist , ready to attack at any moment , like the Headless Horseman ( and I DO mean " headless " ) . The very first murder , in the opening few minutes , has a guy in a cornfield get his head lopped off and we see the blood splatter across the face of a Jack o ' Lantern . Almost all the heads are chopped off graphically on the screen although there isn't that much blood , thanks . I suppose that kids , who ought to enjoy this movie , were part of the intended audience so the gore was contained . As for the Horseman himself - - well , I don't think I like him too much . He's presented as an immortal action figure . He's always in motion , galloping a horse at full speed , striding quickly around . He's dressed in a black cloak over black armor , which is alright , but I think he might have been spookier if he'd been less energetic and more of a plodding , implacable menace . The staging of his attacks are low-brow . There are sword fights out of any number of action movies , with two antagonists , flashing blades , twirling figures , swishing and clanking sounds - - all to no purpose since it's already known that the Horseman can't be beaten . At least they didn't throw in any flying kicks from the Chop Sockey movies . But the figure himself is really terrifying , especially when we don't have a clear view of him . The parts I enjoyed most were simply those in which frightened people were whispering in the shadows . The look and the feel of the late 18th-century Hudson Valley are admirably conveyed , though even that is a little too heavily laid on . Can't remember a single scene that takes place in broad daylight . It's as if the sun didn't exist in Sleepy Hollow .
441915	819382	39152	6.0	Schematic Conversion	In all but two respects this is a typical Republic Studios Western . There is little doubt about who is good and who is bad . No sympathy is wasted on anybody . The story begins with a shoot out and takes Wayne , the gunslinger , mumbingly half-conscious , to the house of some Quaker family , who nurse him back to health , introduce him to the purity of their daughter , Gail Russel , and finally convert him from his heathen ways . Wayne by this time was a propulsive force at Republic and this is " A John Wayne Production . " Wayne was in a position to hire James Edward Grant as the writer , and Grant in fact does a journeyman job on the script . He gives some decent lines to the characters , especially the Doc , Tom Powers . In the long run , though , it was probably a mistake to hire Grant . Wayne was so pleased with the dialog that he used Grant repeatedly for the rest of his career because , as Wayne once said , " he knows how to write for me . " Therein lies the problem . Grant kept writing the same laconic , masculine , flawless character for Wayne , long after movie goers had become more sophisticated . Typical Grant-written exchange . Sheriff : " You're a right tall man who looks like he could take care of his self . " Wayne : ( Stand mute , expectant but expressionless . ) Wayne would ride this character well into the 1970s with only minor variations , seemingly oblivious to the fact that his best roles tended towards ambiguity and complexity and challenge , as in " Red River " , " She Wore a Yellow Ribbon , " and " True Grit . " Well , anyhoo . I said there were two exceptions to the generalization that this was just another routine Western . One exception is the fact that Wayne begins as a gun man and ends as a pacifist married to a Quaker . The usual trajectory goes in the other direction . The gun slinger tries to hang up his guns and become a farmer but instead is drawn back into mano a mano combat , as in " Shane . " True enough , there is the final shoot out that the audience is craving and the bad guys die by natural causes ( bullets ) but Wayne doesn't do the shooting . A Deus ex Machina does . The second exception is Gail Russel . She's the Quaker daughter who realizes , after watching the wounded Wayne toss around in bed and mutter about other girls , that she loves him . She does more than simply love him . She throws herself at his feet , even after she's learned that he rode into Rimrock and had a fling with the hoorah gals in the whorehouse there . Gail Russell , not much of an actress , is a porcelain doll , her pale selenian beauty combining vulnerability and sex appeal . ( That vulnerability was all too real . She was found dead in her mid-30s surrounded by bottles of booze . ) But - - never mind that . Okay , she's thoroughly neurotic and insecure . But , as Wayne might have said , I kinda LIKE that in a WUMMIN . Instead of throwing herself at the feet of somebody like Wayne , why couldn't she have thrown herself at the feet of somebody like me ? Granted , I was never much with a gun but I can wield a pencil with the best of them . You should see my fast draw . ( " Fast draw " with a pencil . Pun , execrable . ) The DVD on which I watched this was plain awful . The images were blurred and the dialog indistinct . I was momentarily startled when somebody says the line : " And he had the GALL to ride to this house ? " Wayne doesn't really put much effort into the movie . Grant's lines come easily to him , as does his riding , after all those years in B Westerns . But it's a more complex story than most of his earlier and later ones . It stands up well next to , say , " The Man From Monterey " or " The Train Robbers . "
441661	819382	41487	6.0	Dysfunctional Family .	Pretty interesting story , and adult too . Robinson is Pa Minetti , an Italian immigrant , formerly a penurious barber , now the prosperous president of his own bank . He has three older sons - - Luther Adler , Valentine , and Zimbalist . And he favors his youngest son , Max ( Richard Conte ) , who is a lawyer and has his office in Pa's bank . All kind of cozy , like the warm Italian family in The Godfather . But there's a problem . Robinson has brought his old-world ways to the new world . He's not only the president of the bank , but president of the family too , and nobody elected him . Someone calls him " Il Duce . " ( Kids , that was the title of Benito Mussolini , the Italian dictator in the 1930s and the early 1940s , when his subjects hung him out to dry . ) But Pa has , in fact , absorbed some of the ways of the new world , only it's the wrong philosophy . The philosophy can be summarily described as , " Dog Eat Dog . " Boy , does Pa browbeat his three older sons , both at work and at home . He has Luther Adler , his first born , working in a teller's cage . Efram Zimbalist , Jr . , has some menial position too . And the biggest and strongest , Paul Valentine as Pietro , wears a guard's uniform . He's constantly ordering them to get back to work . And he refers to Valentine as " dumbhead " repeatedly . Even at the weekly family dinners , when the sons bring their families over for Ma's spaghetti dinners , he plays opera on the phonograph - - and LOUD , so nobody can hear anybody else . And Pa makes everyone wait at the table until Conte arrives . " Nobody's eat untilla Max gets ahere . " The three elder sons don't care much for the kind of humiliation that Pa is dishing out , though he's rarely mean about it . He just takes it for granted that they know they'll inherit the bank one day when he's gone , and meantime they'll have some notion of what he himself went through , as they crawl on their bellies like dogs and can't afford decent apartments for their wives and kids . How does Conte treat all this ? With aplomb . He speaks up for his brothers when they ask him to but he doesn't take it all too seriously . I mean , what the hell , he's a lawyer and Pa's favorite son . A run on the bank ( this is 1932 ) exposes a few weaknesses in Pa's book keeping . He doesn't know the meaning of the word " collateral . " He lends money based on his reckoning of whether he'll get it back , accompanied by usurious interest . He keeps money stashed in a cigar box and writes his records on napkins , things like that . So he's brought to trial and is about to be convicted . The older brothers don't care . Pa's just getting what he deserves . But Conte is representing him in court and , seeing the guillotine blade about to fall , interferes with a juror and is sent to prison for seven years . The cops were tipped off by the other brothers , which annoys Conte no end . So when Conte is finally released from jail he intends to take care of them but , due to the seasonal interposition of an adventitious girl friend , Susan Hayward , he decides not to because that would have represented the worst of Pa's desires . A free man , he leaves with Hayward for San Francisco and the brothers get the bank . So long , Pa . Joseph L . Mankievicz directed it efficiently and the script is occasionally very keen . An example of what I mean . Susan Hayward calls Conte and tells him to come to her place ; it's a legal emergency . Well , it isn't . She just wants to have some fun with him . He turns her offer down but she says , " Let's go to dinner . I'll get my wrap . " Conte walks to the door and opens it , then looks back at her . She drops the wrap on the couch and they stand there silently . Fade out . There's a marvelous scene in a seedy bar . Mankievicz's camera glides along from booth to booth , passing one in which a fat , older man with a cigar is sitting next to a frozen young lady . Neither says a word . A few minutes later , Conte and Hayward look up from their drinks when they hear a slight sob , and there is a cut to the other couple . The girl has covered her face with her hands and the fat man is looking around self consciously . A vignette whose character we can fill in with our imaginations . I said it was an adult movie but that hint of premarital intercourse isn't why . The characters are ambiguous , as people in real life would be . In some ways , for instance , Pa is a lovable old patriarch , but he's also monstrously insensitive to the feelings of others . And the murderous resentment of the older kids is made understandable too . And Richard Conte's character is aggressive and domineering at the beginning , just as a spoiled youngster might be , but he develops into a Mensch by the end of the tale . Hayward develops too , from a whimsical high-end nympho to a woman mature enough to settle for one man , even if he's broke . I don't know why this had to be an Italian family , though . The Italianate elements seem superimposed on the family dynamics , like one of those nude celebrity photos in which the face of the actress or model has been placed on a fake body . Sure , they eat spaghetti and Pa listens to The Barber of Seville . So what ? The writers have resorted to stereotypes . I hate stereotypes . Furthermore , no Italian boy has ever been named " Max " . They are all named " Tony " and when born are not wrapped in swaddling clothes but dressed in iddy biddy suits of rubbed silk . But that's a small thing in this big , complicated , and largely successful tale of power and jealousy .
442079	819382	120660	6.0	Hold on to your hats , boys and girls !	The movie falls completely apart at the end , but before the last ten minutes we have a rootin ' , tootin ' action movie full of technological wizards , chases , shootouts , a hero climbing the face of a hotel in his underwear , a couple of murders , voyeurism , the loner hero's pet cat , and two mismatched protagonists against the National Security Agency , with the FBI as the unwitting good guys this time around . It's the kind of movie in which every vehicle seems sooner or later to explode in a fireball . Now , we have to ask right off the bat about verisimilitude here . The NSA ( or , pardon me , what appears to be a " rogue group " within the NSA ) murders a senator ( Jason Robards ) who opposes their plan to surveille everyone in search of terrorists - - or whatever . They have satellites at their disposal that can read your credit card number from 150 miles in space . If they want to know something about you , they don't just plant a bug in your phone . They plant a dozen bugs in your home and one or two tiny cameras as well . They ransack your place and plant transponders in your shoes , your pen , your pants , your belt , and - - well , I lost count . The reason I raise the question of exactly how realistic all this wizardry and chicanery is , is because , as you might know , as this is being written the Executive Branch of the government , it turns out , has been using the super-secret NSA and Special Ops to surveille its own citizens as well as anyone else on the planet , and without resorting to any of that tedious " getting a warrant " business . The Executive Branch has assured us that only " terrorists , terrorist supporters , terrorist groups or similar groups " are targets , and of course we believe it , although I must say I'm awfully glad I'm not Barbra Streisand anyway . The movie was released in 1998 before the attacks and , boy , have things changed . The acting is pretty good . Gene Hackman is finally beginning to look his age , and it's about time . Will Smith I didn't find a convincing actor but he certainly looks the part . He seems handsome , energetic , and has ears the size of radar antennae that contribute to the film's considerable comedic element . Jon Voight is good too , as the Congressman who wants to impose surveillance on the country . The movie doesn't treat him cheaply either . He's given a home and a family whose respect and warmth he enjoys . The Special Ops guys working for the NSA aren't your usual ugly pock-faced heavies either . They all look no more than thirty . They're pale , fresh faced , and they dress not in black suits but in sweatshirts , watch caps , and Reeboks . They're physically empowered but they're also able to instigate all kind of high-tech chicanery . And they can trace a phone call from a pay phone in less than a minute . The story isn't very complicated . The MacGuffin is a videotape recording of Robard's murder , which comes into Will Smith's hands . He links up with Hackman and the two of them are on the run for the rest of the movie . I really don't know how accurate the technology is . Maybe it's just somebody's patched-together fantasy . The NSA spy satellite that tracks pedestrians on earth just sends out nothing but a signal in Morse code - - " CQ " - - repeatedly , which only translates as something like , " Is anybody listening " ? I doubt that there are any credit card numbers buried in that . I hope the rest of the technology is equally unrealistic , otherwise this movie is much more spooky now than its makers ever intended it to be .
442800	819382	41724	6.0	Hollywood's Foreign Legion vs . the Ay-rabs .	I tried to count the number of times George Raft , Cavalry Captain in the French Foreign Legion in Morocco , in the early years of the 20th century , blinked , but I didn't see any blinks at all . I wouldn't advance the proposition that George Raft never blinks in this movie . That's not it at all . It's just that I never caught him at it . Possibly because I blinked myself . Why , man , he doth bestride this narrow movie like s Colossus astride Rhodes . He wears the same expression , whether making love or shooting rebels . He looks grim always . He moves purposefully . Everything he is involved in generates the same contour of his facial muscles and , as in a Kuleshov experiment , we interpret it according to context . Excuse me for making a little fun of George Raft . He actually suits the role and the movie pretty well . It's an unpretentious and action-filled , mostly studio-bound , story of proud French soldiers opposing a conflicted culture of Islamic colonials . A leader of one tribe , Eduard Franz , is pretty hostile to the French presence . So much so that he wipes out one of their outposts , despite some friendly gestures on the part of the French . At the same time , Eduard Franz has a very pretty and sensual daughter , Marie Windsor , she of the large and doe-like eyes and a mouth that bespeaks passion . Raft has delivered her from the city to her father's oasis and they have fallen in love with each other . ( Over an enormous bowl of rice . ) The two of them are torn between their conflicting allegiances . Windsor has been to some extent Westernized . She's been away from the tribe long enough to have acquired one of those pointed brassieres that were to become so common in 1950s movies . Not that she needs it . She's superbly feminine and nubile beyond measure . Raft too is torn between his love for her - - his enemy's daughter - - and his commitment to La France , though he never seriously wavers . I don't want to spell out the end , but it really is a little confusing . Eduard Franz's cavalry make a suicidal line-abreast charge against a fortified position that has automatic weapons . Somehow , Marie Windsor gets mixed up in the ruckus and the conflict between enlightened Westerners and benighted tribesmen is resolved . Without being sure why , I can say that I quite enjoyed it - - the stereotypes , the shootings , the battles , the galloping horses , the eyeballs of Marie Windsor , the Russian slurring of English by Akim Tamirov . I think maybe I had OD'd on political arguments and the economic calamity that happened on the day I watched this , but - - whatever - - I loved the action and the mindlessness . All in all , a splendid way to take your mind off things .
442064	819382	83722	6.0	There are cat people and then there are dog people .	This comment may contain spoilers There are two pretty extraordinary shots in this film . In the first , Nastassja Kinski is sitting with her head back on the seat rest . She's traveling in a train . She stares into the camera . And the background changes into a busy railway station where she opens a door and walks into an oneiristic room of tangerine and black leopards and all is explained to her by the image of her brother , Malcom MacDowell . The second is the last shot in the film . We see a screen full of the panther's face . The panther roars open mouthed , then closes its jaws and the frame freezes on the gigantic cat staring into the camera with its hypnotic green eyes and vertical irises . The shot lasts for many seconds . There seems to be no one else in the world but the viewer and that panther , staring at each other . By this time we know pretty much what the panther is feeling . And , our gaze locked on the frozen image , we can easily imagine that the cat's stare is a knowing one , that she knows what we feel too . We seem to be at one with the beast . It's like Rilke on mushrooms . But , apropos , maybe we'd better not make too much of that shot . Many years ago I used to feel the same way after a refreshing dose of herbal tea , staring at the four Beatles staring back at me from the open cover of the Sergeant Pepper album . And besides , when you come right down to it , I'm not sure it's a good idea to have a man-eating carnivore reading your mind . Anyway the director , Paul Schrader , should have his hand shaken for those two scenes . His work throughout is professionally competent . He has a tendency to see the world in terms of good and evil - - usually with someone caught between - - and the results aren't always pretty . " The Cat People " isn't too different in that regard . Alas , though , the thing is another remake . The original was done by Val Lewton at RKO on a budget that was probably one nanobillionth of what was spent on this one , and the earlier version is at least as good , and better in some respects . We must at least give the first version bonus points for originality . I don't want to get into the story because it's either simple enough to have been adequately described elsewhere or so complicated that it would take too much space . Essentially it's about a brother and sister - - MacDowell and Kinski - - who inhabit a world between black panthers and human beings . MacDowell and Kinski seem to be the only specimens around , although the legend suggests they ought to form a community through chain migration . They remain human as long as they mate with their own kind . ( MacDowell wants to put a little something in the kitty . A frisson of incest here . ) If they mate with humans they turn into killer panthers and in order to get well again they must kill . But how can they pass on this catabolic capacity without belonging to a community of cat people ? Right away there's a problem with the plot , similar to the one in the original . Simone Simon in the original was apparently human UNLESS she mated with a human . ( Her long-suffering husband was Kent Smith . ) She morphs into a panther when her psychiatrist puts some moves on her and she tears him to shreds . It took me many years to realize that he must have raped her before this happened , but it couldn't be shown on screen . The problem is that Simone Simon morphs at will twice earlier in the movie , in two truly spooky scenes involving a bus and a swimming pool . Kinski , virgo intacta , also apparently morphs in order to kill a rabbit . The acting is pretty good . John Heard comes across as a likable kind of guy . Annette O'Toole , as the colleague who loves him , is too good to be true . In real life , she'd be a woman who disarticulates her rival Kinski from top to bottom . Now there's an idea . How many more magnetic actresses have there been than Nastassja Kinski ? Not too many . She seems so innocent , with her softly modulated infantile voice . Her lips are askew . Her right eye is open and clear , her left is heavily lidded . She seems rarely to look straight at someone else , so the other person can't know whether Kinski is being shy or sly . She glows with an inner heat , a human Franklin stove with trim legs and a saucy rear . Madre de Dios , that crabbing scene with Heard , when she bends over in her shorts and waders ! The original is the better movie , I think , partly because it was a true original and partly because of the producer's good taste and imagination . You only saw the cat for a few seconds . Here , the animal should get second billing . And in the original too , one had a sense of everyone's leading an ongoing unhurried happy life until Simone brought her sad , diseased nature into it . In this one everything seems at least slightly deranged from the outset .
441872	819382	111001	6.0	You Are What You Eat .	Saw this movie twice . The first time I thought it was tasteless and boring , except for Bridget Fonda's bathtub scene . I recently saw it again after several years and it didn't seem nearly so bad . Maybe I was able to get past the initial feeling that the writers and the director thought that gags about enemas and the like were themselves laugh-worthy . It now seems that the folks behind this production were trying something a little more ambitious than " Porky Goes to a Health Club . " Maybe it's really meant as a seriocomic Martian's eye view of the current bizarre goings on regarding our own health . A few years ago we were told to avoid butter ( high in calories and cholesterol ) . So we switched to margarine . Oops . The health police have now thrown up their hands and pointed to the trans-fatty acids ( " partially hydrogenated vegetable oil " ) which knocks your internal cholesterol-producing apparatus into a cocked hat . When I was a kid we were admonished to consume the health foods du jour - - whole milk and liver . ( Liver was supposed to supply the body with abundant iron but I really think it was recommended so highly because nobody liked it , therefor it must be good for you . ) Of course that's all history , right ? We now know so much better , which is exactly what Dr . Kellog and his colleagues thought in 1895 . Each generation believes it stands on the pinnacle of knowledge and science has nothing left to do but fill in a few missing dots . What colossal arrogance . I suspect that a hundred years from now our current hysteria will seem as deranged to scientists as Kellog's theories seem to us now . If the movie is seen from this perspective , it's a lot funnier than if you look at it simply as a series of jokes about sex and excretion . The score is enjoyable too . The composer has matched her talents to the visuals with a deftness that's hard to describe . The performances are good , as you might expect from such a cast . But Sir Anthony ( " call me Tony " ) Hopkins is more than merely good . He's been kind of careless in his choice of roles and one might think he's an actor of little range , his métier being the thoughtful , sensitive , quiet , quietly suffering man of reticence . But here he's great . He's got a set of false buck teeth on him that turn his every utterance into a comic statement . Not that he relies entirely on such props . Notice the scene in which he informs Mathew Broderick that his wife , Bridget Fonda , is being regularly masturbated by Dr . Spitsvogel . " It's her womb , " he says confidentially , " it's being ma-NIP-ulated ! " And some of the scenes , regardless of any resonance they may have with the present concern with health , are funny in themselves . The scene in which Dr . Kellog's children are all singing Christmas carols in what appears to be a church - - all except one dopey looking kid ( who grows up to be Dana Carvey ) . The kid stands there in the line of singers , sullenly silent , except for the occasional but highly audible rectal zephyr . It seems the perfect response to the health police who have forced Olestra from the store shelves because it causes " anal leakage . " I worked in this scene as an extra in the audience . It was filmed in the attic of one of Wilmington , North Carolina's old mansions and it was a rather spooky experience . The floor was clearly not designed to hold dozens of people and several long tons of cinematic hardware . It was like walking on a trampoline . The director kept pausing and trying to redistribute the weight but it was no use . All I could think of was the scene in Nathaniel West's " Day of the Locus " in which Napolean's army or something crashes through the fake mountain and tumbles to its death . PS : It didn't happen here .
442094	819382	387059	6.0	Indolent look at a kaleidoscope of themes .	Well , just about every kind of quirk you might expect to find in a nice Jewish academic family in Berkeley is tucked away somewhere in this leisurely trip through misunderstandings . Richard Gere , gone white and looking great , does most of the talking and most of the moving . He teaches Hebrew Studies , he coaches his son on the cello , he always cooks dinner at home . ( Pretty liberated , eh ? ) Now Gere isn't frenetic as he sometimes has been , as in , say , " Power " . His buzzing activity mostly stands out because nobody else has much of it . His wife , Juliette Binoche , has lost her family and wanders around with all the substance of a wisp of smoke . It turns out she's covering up some quirky activities , even for a family like this . She has a garage full of broken trinkets she's collected from other people's properties . They hang from the ceiling in a multitude of sparkling threads , tinkling a little bit , as Gere discovers them and goggles at the sight . Then there's the son , Aaron . Gere is a devoutly religious man who would like to be a mystic but is reduced to merely studying Jewish mysticism . But the son ? Well , he's a whiz on the cello . With a father like Gere you could hardly be other than a whiz at whatever he urged you to try . And Aaron is searching for God too . But where does he find God ? In the now-defunct Hare Krishnas . Of course it could have been worse . Aaron might have dug up some suicide cult . But still , for some people it must be getting a bit tiresome to deal with people who have learned that God is communicating with them . Andy Warhol once claimed that he'd been given a dead phone but that God was supposed to be on the other end waiting for his call . Warhol never made the call because he could never think of anything to say . Doctor Fielgut's advice is this : Do find God , if you can , but then whatever he tells you keep it to yourself . Oh , yes . Then there's the little daughter , reserved , soft , vulnerable , unamazing in any way until she discovers that she has some form of synesthesia regarding words . When she hears " cotyledon " defined , she closes her eyes and is swirled about with leaves . When Gere finds this out - - WOW ! TWO geniuses in the family , not including him and Juliette Binoche who is " a scientist . " Aaron and his cello are put on the back burner while Gere hovers over his daughter and tells her emphatically that God is in the letters . In the end she teaches him a valuable lesson too , humility . There's something distasteful about judged performances like spelling bees though . I say this not only because Barbara Lukashinsky came in first , to my second , in a fifth-grade spelling bee , just because I misspelled a stupid word like " nickel " and she got it right . No , it's not that at all , even though she didn't deserve first prize . It's that like other judged performances , spelling bees are a zero-sum game . One can only " win " at the expense of someone else . It's competition in its purest form . You win the prize by beating everyone else . But who wins a prize for cooperation ? Or self sacrifice ? Roger Bannister was the first person to run a 4-minute mile . Does anyone remember who was the second runner to break four minutes ? It isn't that competition is necessarily bad per se . It can boost team solidarity and even be fun . The main problem with spelling bees is that they encourage lazy , categorical thinking about either " victory " or " defeat " , while " compromise " has no part in the contest . This is a pretty slow movie . It's almost European . It's stuffed with far too many themes , like the kaleidoscope ( did I spell that right ? ) that Binoche hands down to daughter Emily . Impossible to grasp them all . But it's a nice change to see a film that challenges us .
441789	819382	39645	6.0	Should be better .	Bob Hope's comedies could be hilarious , but this one isn't . He plays his usual character , a coward who imitates his private-eye neighbor and gets into all kinds of hot water with Dorothy Lamour while searching for a map that will break up a ring of international gangsters who want to locate a uranium mine that " some other country " is interested in . ( This is 1947 . ) There were a plenitude of mock private-eye movies that came out about this time , generated by the popularity of the 1940s noir films and , later , given a second-stage rocket boost by the Mike Hammer novels . The climactic ballet of " The Bandwagon " is another example , from a musical yet . But I don't care about that . Well-done parodies can stand on their own , even if the target becomes a bit dated . The problem here is that the wisecracks and gags , though delivered by Hope with his usual élan , just aren't funny enough . Hope's dithering cowardice is amusing , but the rest of the film is below par for him . I'm trying to think of a gag that I can use as an example of mediocrity , but although I just finished watching the movie on DVD , none of them comes to mind . That's symptomatic . Good cast too . Lon Chaney , Jr . , Peter Lorre , other good supporting players , cameos by Alan Ladd and Bing Crosby . And nice location shooting in San Francisco and on the Monterey Peninsula . The mansion that's the principal setting is still there , and visible from the nearby drive . The movie isn't an insult to the audience and not exactly a blot on the record of the participants . It has its comedic qualities . Kids might get a big kick out of it , especially if they're not acquainted with Hope's work elsewhere . If you want to join in the laughter , rent one of Hope and Crosby's better " On the Road " movies .
442379	819382	70022	6.0	Stylized study of murder and character .	Everybody likes to ride around on a motorcycle in the sunshine , and , what with the desert climate of southern Arizona , you get not only the wind in your hair and the scent of sagebrush but a rosy tan as well . Unfortunately , Robert Blake and his partner , Zipper ( Billy Green Bush ) , are constrained by their police uniforms and what they call proper police procedure , or PPP . The movie is essentially about how closely the police force follows that procedure when murder is involved . Two old weirdos live in a desert trailer and when one is found murdered the other ( Elisha Cook , Jr . , more flamboozled than ever ) is arrested . But did he do it ? And , if so , why ? The written story is dated . The affable and sympathetic Blake is taken under the wing of his superior , Mitch Ryan , a big blustering detective who beats up hippie informants while Blake must stand silently by . Yes , this is a movie which pits the ugly cops against the far-from-innocent but still human hippies . The hippies dress in rags , do dope , and - - hold on - - they have long hair . All they want is to be left unhassled , but Ryan is intent on cementing community relations by beating them to a pulp . Mitchell is not only a bully but , even worse , his drunken girl friend explains to Blake that he is also impotent , causing Mitchell to almost pop his cork and hate Blake , finally demoting him and putting him back in uniform on his hated police motorcycle . ( He'd love to have a more colorful machine with Electraglide transmission . ) I think Blake's motorcycle represents the police force , which in turn represents the society which the hippies must live in and which hates them for reasons that are " accidental " rather than " essential . " Mainly , they look funny . ( None of them can act , either . ) In fact , I think Robert Blake's character must illustrate Edmund Burke's dictum , " All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing . " How else can we explain this good man's assassination by previously harassed hippies at the end ? Why else does Blake suffer ? He's guilty of no wrong doing , intelligent enough to solve a rather complicated homicide , and in the end courageous enough to tell his sadistic boss that the boss is full of horse hockey . The dialog is kind of stylized , especially Mitch Ryan's . He carries on with his rodomontade as if speaking to Jesus . It isn't exactly realistic . That's okay because at least it's an attempt to be original . The narrative , though , sometimes falls flat . After being promoted to detective by Ryan , Blake lovingly dresses himself in expensive new civilian clothes , if a modified cowboy outfit can be considered civilian , and strides outside only to look down and see that he's forgotten to put on his trousers . It's not really either credible or amusing , though it's supposed to be cute , I guess . The direction is okay . The camera is where it should be , and at the proper times , but - - can we have some kind of moratorium on slow-motion violence ? Sheez ! A pursued hippie on a motorcycle crashes through a cafe window and I fell asleep before he finally hit the floor . The climactic scene was shot in Monument Valley . Warning to all film makers . Lay off . That's John Ford territory .
443224	819382	35612	6.0	Wartime Sabotage .	" The Adventures of Tartu . " Sounds like a children's movie , doesn't it ? Maybe about an orphan elephant or a unicorn . But it's more serious than that . Robert Donat is a British chemist sent into Rumania , through Germany , into Czechoslovakia to sabotage a huge industrial plant where the Nazis are manufacturing vast amounts of poison gas . Since he is fluent in Rumanian and German , he is able to impersonate a real Rumanian " Iron Guard " officer named Jan Tartu . In Pilsen , Czechoslovakia , whence " Pilsener " beer , he lodges with a patriotic Czech family , along with Valerie Hobson , the soul of elegance . The youngster in the family , a factory worker , is the teen-aged Glynis Johns , she of the wide brow and slanted eyelids . Donat is given one of those black Nazi uniforms with the tight boots and wide riding breeches that the movies required of the Nazis at that time , and he is appointed supervisor of the workers at the plant . He needs the help of the Czech underground but he doesn't know how to get in touch with them . Can he trust Valerie Hobson , who seems like a closet patriot under all that arrogance ? The Gestapo keep nosing around though , so he must be ever vigilant . Identities get mixed up . Mistakes are made . Glynis Johns is caught sabotaging some of the shells being manufactured in the plant and is executed . But Donat succeeds in his mission , blows the plant to smithereens , and makes a suspenseful escape with Hobson and a few other patriots in a Junkers 88 . For such a complicated yet slight tale , the story generates a good deal of suspense . And it's an appealing piece of work , due in large measure to Donat's performance as the ersatz Iron Guard officer . He overplays the womanizing trait of the character but that's a problem with the script and the direction , not Donat's performance . He's charming in the role and seems a likable kind of guy . The rest of the cast consists of seasoned players and provides good support . The story seems a little trite now . There were so many like it during the war . Errol Flynn's " Desperate Journey " was a lot more fun , and Fritz Lang's " Hangmen Also Die " did a better job of capturing the ethos of occupied Czechoslovakia . Still , this is not a bad example of the genre . It's too bad that Czechoslovakia has been split into the Czech Republic and that other independent nation whose name I can never remember . It makes one of the London Times ' crossword puzzle entries obsolete . Quick - - name a major seaport in the middle of Czechoslovakia . Oslo . CzechOSLOvakia . Get it ? What can you do with a name like The Czech Republic ? " Name a British saloon near the end of The Czech Republic " ? That's ridiculous .

But the plot is simply lacking in real drama and doesn't have much in the way of character development . There seem to be several unrelated subplots . A young woman seems to have committed suicide , but maybe it's murder . Her sister arrives in town and falls for Johnny O'Clock ( Dick Powell ) but will they marry ? A bad cop disappears . But we don't really get to know any of them to care much about them . And everything is pulled together with a few offhand words by Dick Powell just before the end . I kind of wanted to like it because I'm fond of noirs and think that Rossen's work elsewhere has sometimes been superb , but this one got by me . People walk around and talk to one another . There are card games and two shootings . Girls smile at men , who dismiss them . It's all on the surface . As the detective says in " Psycho , " " If it doesn't jell , it isn't aspic . And this isn't jelling . " It's still interesting to watch - - once .
441678	819382	470929	6.0	The Mystery of the Severed Ears .	This is a fantasy , a mosaic made out of three complementary sets of tesserae . We have the " biographer " Selden ( Tim McInnerny ) whose assignment is to try to dig up any links between Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle ( Douglas Henshall ) and his fictional creation , the detective Sherlock Holmes , although it is agreed that any results will not be published . There are also contemporary episodes from which Selden is excluded , for good reason . These include a couple of women - - Doyle's own devoted wife and a knockout babe he would like to disarticulate with his tongue . And then there are flashbacks to Conan-Doyle's own earlier years , including his medical tutelage at Edinburgh under Doctor Joseph Bell ( Bryan Cox ) . The three sets of episodes are woven together in a way that is sometimes confusing , the way a dream is confusing , but gradually revealing , until , by the end , all is explained . Or almost all . I didn't get the recurring images of the severed ears crawling with maggots . Okay - - " The Cardboard Box . " But why is this image repeated ? Why is it IN there in the first place ? I missed the first few minutes and perhaps the answer lies there , though I can't imagine how . Of course I could speculate , but it is always dangerous to theorize before one is in possession of all the relevant facts . The most interesting moments - - not necessarily the most dramatic - - are when Dr . Bell pulls of one of those stunts that were later to become inferential staples of the Holmes character . Given a watch to examine , a watch that has been owned by a perfect stranger , Bell complains that the watch has recently been cleaned and this robs him of his most important clues to the owner's character , so he can only say that the man was careless , came from a good family but found his fortunes drop , punctuated by intervals of prosperity , that in later life his habits declined , probably because of drink , and that he had a penchant for 17-year-old blonds all his life . ( I made that last one up . ) Conan-Doyle must have represented one of the last twitches of the Scottish enlightenment that enthroned reason and empiricism , because when he was old , after he'd lost a son in the war , Conan-Doyle turned to mysticism and the séances that were fashionable at the time . The mystery that is investigated in some detail is the reason why Conan-Doyle decided to " kill " his creation , Sherlock Holmes , at a time when Holmes was probably the most famous fictional character in the world , much as Brittany Spears is now . I failed to catch any big reveal towards the end , but at the climax Conan-Doyle resurrects his detective and they march off together into the sunlight . If the viewer is left still a little mystified , evidently Conan-Doyle wasn't , and that's what counts . However , the detective figure that is Holmes in the last few shots on the Great Grimpen Mire is not by any definition Sherlock . It is MYCROFT Holmes that we see . Who's kidding whom around here ? It's an inexpensive production from the BBC and it's about an interesting guy , Conan-Doyle . He was at his peak during the Jack-the-Ripper murders in 1875 . Too bad he didn't tackle Saucy Jack . Of course Conan-Doyle can't be counted among the world's most graceful prose artists . On a dark and stormy night , " the wind sobbed like a child in the chimney . " ( How did the child get into the chimney ? ) And , true , our introduction to Holmes , in " A Study in Scarlet " , makes him look an awful lot like Poe's August Dupin in " The Murders in the Rue Morgue . " But what does that matter ? Conan-Doyle ground out these entertaining mysteries with sprezzatura , hiding his art by making it look so easy , and he gave us some deathless lines . " The curious incident of the dog in the night . " " She was always THE woman . " And , " Quick , Watson , the needle . " ( Well , he never said exactly that , but , again , so what ? ) You may have to be in the right mood to watch this . It's rather slow . But it's a must-see for the Irregulars .
441916	819382	41178	6.0	Mitchum and Greer - - Together Again !	" The Big Steal " , pairing Robert Mitchum with Jane Greer again , the couple from " Out of the Past . " It sounds profoundly noir . But in fact it's not . It's more of a romantic adventure with comedic and dramatic elements sprinkled around in it . You see , Mitchum is Halliday , an Army lieutenant in charge of the payroll . While carrying the $350 , 000 he was held up by Jim Fiske , Patric Knowles . Mitchum reported the robbery to his superior , Captain Blake , William Bendix . But Bendix doesn't believe him . Knowles takes the money and flees to central Mexico where a fence , John Qualen , is waiting to launder the money in the local lavanderia or something . Knowles speeds through quaint villages and through the kinds of resorts wherein you sit next to the swimming pool and sip pink drinks with umbrellas protruding from the glasses . Mitchum is in hot pursuit of Knowles and the stash , and has picked up Jane Greer along the way , a woman that Knowles has somehow betrayed . In hot pursuit of Mitchum and Greer is William Bendix , armed and dangerous , carrying extradition papers regarding Mitchum . Mitchum and Greer had made the successful " Out of the Past " just earlier and this presumably was an attempt by RKO to cash in on their popularity . Mitchum is big and hefty and embodies momentum in his stride . I'm not so sure that this is his kind of role . It wouldn't take much to imagine Cary Grant doing a far better job . Jane Greer is an interesting woman . Her acting isn't more than professional in caliber but she LOOKS so exotically familiar . Her eyelids are like a lizard's eyelids and her irises and lips glisten sensually at times . She was in a Columbo episode when she was over fifty and still looked as good if not better . And take a dekko at " No Way Out . " John Qualen is nobody's cynical fence , though . He's a poor but honest farmer working for John Ford . Patric Knowles gets the job done . William Bendix is shown as an angry but somewhat foolish avenger . His hot pursuit is constantly frustrated by road construction or a herd of goats loose on the road . The Mexican actors , by and large , are played for laughs , except for the Inspector General , Ramon Navarro , who may be cute but who is savvy as well . Given all the light-hearted wisecracking that goes on between Mitchum and Greer , the action scenes are discordantly realistic . When Knowles gets slapped around by Mitchum , he remembers it later and takes revenge . A punch in the face leads to a bloody nose instead of a comely trickle from the corner of Mitchum's lips . The location shooting is nicely evocative . For some reason the talent are almost always shot in interiors or in isolated stopovers . The use of doubles in second-unit shooting is conspicuous . And the special effects are sometimes clumsy . Why undercrank the camera when the cars are already spinning around dangerous curves ? By 1949 the audience was wised up to such tricks . And why , when a driver is seen in a car mock up against a rear projection screen , does the car lean INTO the curve ? Yes , if you're piloting an airplane . No , if you're driving a car . The f / x guys have to bone up on " inertia " . Don Siegel directed but this was an early effort and he was yet to hit his stride . By no definition is this a film noir , but it's not bad for what it is .
442528	819382	37795	6.0	Classic of the genre .	It really IS a classic of the genre , but the problem is that the genre itself is so dated as not to be taken seriously anymore . That happens to genres . Would you watch a Western in which the good guy wears a white hat and the bad guy wears a black hat and one " calls the other out " and they have a mano-a-mano shootout in the middle of the dusty street and the good guy wins and gets the girl ? I mean , that's asking a lot of a modern audience . This film was one of a series of semi-documentaries that came out with the end of the war . Often , as here , Henry Hathaway was the director and the stentorian baritone Reed Hadley was the narrator . I can't vouch for the historical accuracy of the plot , although regardless of the facts I'm sure J . Edgar Hoover was tickled pink when he saw it . Hoover , President-for-Life of the FBI , was a media savvy character . Early in his career he had a skilled partner in Melvin Purvis , the guy who tracked down Dillinger . Such rivalry was not to be tolerated . Purvis's part in the affair , in fact in the FBI , was purged like Akhenaten's until Hoover became the hero . Purvis quit in disgust . Hoover refused to cooperate with Warner's " G-Men " because Jimmy Cagney patronized a saloon , but he gave the FBI's all to this film because the FBI was morally upright and flawless . One scene was of particular interest . A real Nazi spy insists on testing the American counterspy's radio set to see if it can actually reach Hamburg . It doesn't . It transmits directly to a nearby FBI station which then relays the information to Germany , in a slightly altered form . The FBI operator hears the Nazi calling . He looks up and says , " That isn't Bill . I know his fist . " A " fist " is the particular style that an individual operator uses in sending Morse code . It's about as distinctive as his handwriting . I was a radio operator for a few years in the Coast Guard and had a great fist . Most of the other men at my station set their keys to automatic " fast " so they could sound hot . Only they overreached and wound up sending erratically and making a lot of errors . I set mine to " slow " and developed a fist that was heaven to listen to and easy to read . Two Coast Guard radiomen from a ship visited the station in dress blues one afternoon and asked who " LL " was - - those were my sign-off letters . They came over to my console and one said , " We just wanted to tell you that it's a pleasure to copy you . " The two men shook my hand , the three of us blushed , and they made a hurried exit , because real men don't say things like that to one another . Pardon me , that may have been what you call " off topic . " Oh , yes , the movie . Alas , the conventions of the genre demand that the Nazis be evil in every respect . Worse than that , they're rude . When the American counterspy is introduced to them , they don't shake his hand . They don't even greet him , they just scowl . None of them is in love , none of them has a home , none has a dog or a cat or collects stamps . They sacrifice one another for the cause at the drop of a solecism and - - well , you get the picture . The conventions doom the characters as human beings . Loyd Nolan and Signe Hasso are the most watchable , but all of the performances are colorless . Even the hero is dull , despite the danger he often finds himself in . It's still an interesting and exciting flick , once you adapt to its weaknesses . Fascinating to see the way in which two-way mirrors are presented as the high-tech novelty they were at the time . And the pre-computer FBI's fingerprint storage - - " Five THOUSAND fingerprints on file ! " , Hadley announces proudly . It's worth catching if it is convenient .
441900	819382	100404	6.0	These Lawyers Keep Writing Novels	It used to be doctors that boasted about the literary artists that rose from their ranks - - William Carlos Williams , Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle , Michael Crighton , Frank Slaughter . ( Frank Slaughter ? ) Now it's coming to be lawyers . Back in 1959 , " Anatomy of a Murder " was a lonely best seller . Lately there has been a cascade of more or less autobiographical books about lawyers from the likes of Turow and Gresham . And the movies inevitably follow the bucks , I mean the books . I wish Turow had used a little more imagination in cooking up the names for his characters , especially since they seem designed to represent a little microcosm of ethnic identities . I guess Sabich is properly Polish , and Horgan irretrievably Irish , and lawyer Stern can be a Jewish lawyer who looks and speaks like a Puerto Rican . Polhemus may be a little unusual but not everyone can claim a hyphenized national allegiance . The attempt is weak with the Italian characters , though . Molto ? Too much for me to believe . And Della Guardia is plumb wrong . La Guardia is an occupational name , meaning " guard , " pretty much like " Steward " in English . But " de la " indicates a place name , like " von " in German or " van " in Dutch . " Della " and " Guardia " are a mismatched couple . " From the guard " ? It would be like an Italian novelist making up a character name like " Cookson " or " Bakerson . " The animal doesn't exist . Oh - - the movie ? It's okay . It rolls along in its sexy , suspenseful , stereotypical way , an efficient example of how to reconstruct in an unidentifiable manner a story already familiar from " The Big Clock " and " No Way Out " and " Where the Sidewalk Ends " and a couple of others . Harrison Ford mopes efficiently through his part . I like Brian Dennehy a lot better as a nice guy than a heavy . Raul Julia is reassuring , almost comforting , in the role of Ford's defense counsel . If I were to be tried for murder I would want him and his underplayed confidence and his big dark gentle eyes to represent me rather than the skulky guilty-looking Ford . Bonny Bedelia is okay . Greta Scacchi is a knockout , so to speak , so it's a double tragedy when she gets her head bashed in . John Spencer is always reliable - - or was . He died a month ago . Too bad , a reliable New Jerseyish everyman . It's worth catching but not worth commenting further on .
441627	819382	115736	6.0	Nifty B Thriller	With very little effort you could visualize this on the screen of some neighborhood theater - - The Ritz or the Bijou or the Mayfair - - in , say , 1949 . Only then it would be in black and white . The credits take about 90 seconds to unroll . It stars people like Edmond O'Brian and Adele Jergens and Marie Windsor and Ted DeCorsia . It's not called " Bound , " though . I'm having a little trouble putting that together . It's called something more like " The Big Con " or Edge of Darkness " or " Where Danger Lives . " " Bound " is a bit too suggestive even for 1949 . " Bound " is a B movie . The script is pretty elementary , the film has no bankable stars , everybody double-crosses everybody else , and it's cheaply made . But it's updated through the direction , which gives us not just some hood holding a snub-nosed . 38 at his hip and shooting someone once . Instead , the hood holds his big pistol sideways and at eye level . Okay , this makes no sense . If you're going to hold it high enough to take aim , why hold the weapon sideways ? The answer , I guess , is that that's how it's done in modern thrillers . Frankly , I blame Bruce Willis for this . He was the first to use this self-defeating convention on screen , that I know of , in " Die Hard . " It's updated too in that the director has more freedom . So , for instance , the camera can climb up an apartment wall and then OVER the top into the apartment next door . And , people aren't usually shot just once but several times . Sometimes many times . Bullet holes and blood all over the place . And when shot , the victim doesn't simply grasp his belly and grimace , then twirl around and crumple to the floor . He throws out his arms , slips around on a floor covered with bone-white latex interior paint , dripping blood in artsy patterns onto the slickness . It could be grand opera , except that sometimes the victim has time enough , though bullet-riddled , to raise his finger as if lecturing the shooter and make some absurd wisecrack - - " Please don't shoot , " in this case . And it's updated also because the two lovers take off with the boodle to live happily ever after , we guess . In 1949 the lovers would have been maybe Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Ryan . Here the lovers are two lesbians . ( Some nice , but not hot sex between them is thrown in for the voyeurs . ) And although they are both pre-verts and at least one of them has murdered somebody in cold blood , the getaway vehicle in the final scene doesn't plunge off a cliff , as it would have had to in 1949 . What I mean is , did Hannibal Lecter die at the end of " Silence of the Lambs " ? No - - and he ATE people . Times have changed . Gina Gershon with her protruding lips could pass for an ex inmate . Jennifer Tilly's voice is a slow , wispy croak and she comes across as the dark side of the moon of Melanie Griffith . The Italian mobsters weren't too impressive , but Joe Pantoliano was great as usual . He can play almost anything . Here he covers his Jersey City accent with a reasonably authentic Chicago sound , although perhaps nobody but Pantoliano would catch it , or would care if they did . Interesting minor flick , worth watching .
442493	819382	401997	6.0	Pretty good spy story .	Chris Cooper is Robert Hanssen , a traitor working within the FBI and selling secrets to the Russians . The FBI knows about the billions of dollars of damage he's done and the lives that he's had sacrificed , but they need more solid evidence to put him away for good . They recruit Eric O'Neill ( Ryan Phillippe ) , a novice lawyer at the Bureau , as a mole who is to work as Cooper's immediate underling . Cooper thinks Phillippe is working for him , but he's really working for a different department , run by Laura Linney . Phillippe must conceal his work from his German-born wife , Juliana , leading to the usual mess in which the guy must not only keep his work secret but must keep secret the fact that he's keeping it a secret . In the end , Cooper is nailed and put away for life , and Phillippe quits the bureau for an independent ( and undoubtedly more lucrative ) private practice . Ryan Phillippe is adequate but he's up against some seasoned and impressive players . His performance is even overwhelmed by Dennis Haysbert in a small part . You'll recognize Haysbert when you see him . He's told us in his sonorous baritone a thousand times that , " You're in good hands with Allstate . " I'm going to skip most of the details of how Cooper is finally trapped , partly because I don't quite understand them . For instance , Cooper makes a final drop at the drop place , but I couldn't figure out how anyone managed to divine the location of the drop site . Anyway , the movie belongs to Christ Cooper and , man , is he good . When we first meet him , he's sour , pasty , and mean to his subordinate . He hates Hillary Clinton , lesbians , and the usual betes noires of the right wing . He doesn't approve of drinking . He and his family attend mass every morning and makes snotty comments about Protestants . He seems at first like a stereotype , yet as the movie rolls along in its deliberate pace we see that he's a far more complex character than we might have thought . He's genuinely sympathetic as Phillippe tells him lies about his sick grandmother in order to cover his own attempts to uncover solid evidence . And he sends around tapes of him and his wife making love . We get to know Cooper's character only through the eyes of Phillippe , so as the character unfolds he seems to lurch from one state to another . For instance , we know Cooper doesn't drink . But he shows up unexpectedly at Phillipe's house drunk , takes Phillippe into Rock Creek Park , and shoots a few rounds near him to find out if Phillippe really is what he says he is , a mere clerk . After a scene like that , you can't help wondering what is going through Cooper's mind , what - - exactly - - happened to him to bring him to this state ? I'll give one example of Cooper's expertise in this film . Phillippe has just been in Cooper's office , rifling some files , and is almost caught when Cooper returns sooner than expected . Cooper enters his office , looks around , and then saunters over to Phillippe's desk . " O'Neill , have you been in my briefcase ? " Phillipe makes up some BS cover story about spilled water and having to move the briefcase , while Cooper listens doubtfully . And if you want to see a good actor express " doubt " without either underplaying or going overboard , watch the expression on Cooper's face while he parses this story in his head . There are no shoot outs and the suspense is limited to a few incidents . Mostly it's a drama about character . There is no question that Cooper was a traitor and there is virtually nothing about his motives . Nor need there be . I'll speculate anyway . It wasn't money . He evidently made lots of it but he didn't need it , and it seems hardly worth risking humiliation , arrest , and a life sentence in prison . Cooper lives about the way his character should live , not modestly but not opulently either . Cooper's character does mutter something about the thrill that comes from being part of a team looking for someone , and knowing that you yourself are the person they're looking for . It might be a clue . There's a sensuous quality to outwitting other people , a reward in itself . Money needn't be part of it . That's why we enjoy playing scrabble or hearts . That's why a burglar will tip-toe through a house in which he KNOWS others to be present , just in order to steal a purse with a few dollars in it , as happened to my mother . It satisfies our desire for self testing - - how good are we ? What a rush !
442722	819382	100151	6.0	Cosmos Through the Looking Glass .	Three people meet , walk around , and talk on Mont-St . - Michel . They are an American poet in exile ( John Heard ) , a frustrated politician ( Sam Waterston ) , and a disillusioned physicist ( Liv Ullman ) . It's sort of wintry and bleak at Mont-St . - Michel , which looks as imposing and impenetrable from the inside as it does from a distance , a great Disneyland castle of a place , perched on and overgrowing an island that becomes part of the mainland at low tide . As good a place to talk as any . You surely don't have to worry about being overwhelmed by the sounds of traffic because here , among the stone walls and spires , the internal combustion engine doesn't seem to have been invented yet . So what do they talk about , these three charming characters ? Well , it's mostly a lecture by Ullman's physicist . She delivers it the way Carl Sagan pitched his material in " Cosmos . " She covers quite a lot of ground but it's not hard to follow , although it may make you wish you'd paid more attention in Mrs . Gridley's class in Physics 101 . She winds up pimping a holistic view of the planet . Nothing evolves . Everything co-evolves , and our thinking is short sighted . We are what Tielhard de Chardin called " the thinking part of the earth . " An American Indian tribe ( she claims ) takes action only when it has thought about the consequences of that action for the seventh generation from now . Well , I couldn't agree more with her about that . Ullman seems so good-natured , even in her skepticism , that it keeps the freshet of ideas from becoming somniferous . Heard and Waterston have less to do . " So what does all this mean ? " , asks Waterston . And Heard gets to illustrate some of Ullman's points by quoting Pablo Neruda or playing a chord on an organ to illustrate that individual notes acquire a different meaning when they are played together at the same time . The film has the three characters wander around inside and out , squatting on the sand , having lunch , but doesn't do much to break up the rhythm . It's all cheerful and pleasant and filled with the wonder of it all but it doesn't have much going for it besides its intellectual verve and its unimpeachable acting . I wish they'd have added a fourth character who was a Dadaist or an aging member of Andy Warhol's Factory or a stand-up comic . Maybe Little Richard . I suspect the ultimate goal was not so much to teach the public that atoms are indeed very small , but that everything we do has moral overtones . Most of what we do in the way of scientific research , says Ullman , is paid for by the Pentagon , and we turn the responsibility for using our results back to the people who paid us . And of course the scientists and the Pentagon - - and poets and politicians , as well - - are us . Florence Kluckhohn outlined three ways of adapting to nature : ( 1 ) subjugating ourselves to it , ( 2 ) living in harmony with it , or ( 3 ) conquering it . Ullman plumps for living in harmony with it , of course , but although it sounds suspiciously platitudinous we WILL get politicians standing on earth scorched by forest fires or cities swept away by floods and declaring nature an " enemy . " Here's a quote from another egghead - - Pogo the Possum : " We have met the enemy and he is us . "
442088	819382	131325	6.0	Often funny satire of Hollywood .	This intermittently and sometimes very funny send up of cheap movie making was written by , and stars , Steve Martin . He's pretty good , and so are the other performers . Loved Eddie Murphy as the loser / brother of Kit Ramsey . The film is efficiently directed . The humor , as in a lot of Steve Martin's stuff in The New Yorker , depends on incongruities and irony . The incongruity begins with the title of the film-within-a-film that Martin is supposed to be directing - - " Chubby Rain . " ( Cf . , " Cruel Shoes . " ) The irony shows up in scenes like the post-coital murmurs between Martin and Heather Graham as a would-be actress sleeping her way to the top . " I love you . I promise you I'll never use you , " she tells him . " And I will never betray your trust , " he swears , after just having pocketed her credit card . Frank Oz did a good job on the direction . The scene is which an Eddie Murphy look alike ( Eddie Murphy ) is told to run across a multiple-lane freeway full of speeding cars and trucks is nearly perfectly done . Not just the idea but the set up and execution . The editing couldn't be better . Oz had to transpose that scene from a more-or-less detailed written screenplay into two dimensional images . Sometimes the script gives Oz an easier job than at others . As the end of the film approaches the pace becomes frantic and there were times when I lost it . Something to do with aliens and pod people . ( One shot is lifted directly from " Invasion of the Body Snatchers . " ) Martin is a bright and imaginative guy , obviously . His humor borders on the fantastic . Things take place that are physically impossible . And the jokes are liable to be over the head of a less alert audience . I mean , are the kids really going to get the connection between MindBust and Dianetics ? Will they recognize the allusion to " the pod people " ? He's rather like a West Coast Woody Allen , without the serious side , but more of a physical actor . His notion of what's funny is more literary than cinematic , bent slightly towards the late S . J . Perelman . I thought Martin's first film , " The Jerk , " was a disaster but there were scenes and dialog in this one that had me laughing out loud . When Eddie Murphy , as a famous movie star , is offered a script , he counts up all the k's in the text , divides by three , and comes up with the number of times the KKK is mentioned in code . No wonder he winds up at MindBust's " Celebrity Rest Home " . Not all the jokes are so successful , but it's a good-natured and diverting comedy - - better than I'd anticipated .
442361	819382	54518	7.0	Pip Pip .	I can only comment on the episodes using Patrick MacNee and Diana Rigg between 1965 and 1968 . What a diverting show it was . MacNee is John Steed , the proper gentleman in bowler hat , wielding his deadly brolly . His character and appearance are perfect for a vehicle like this . It isn't so much that he was never nonplussed , so much as that he was always plussed . Rigg is Emma Peel in her jump suits , zippered up front , with that tantalizing , over-sized ring dangling from the zipper just below her sternoclavicular notch . Diana Rigg has a curious beauty . She sports a pair of wide-set eyes , elevated cheekbones , a perfunctory nose and tiny lips , like a Hentai cartoon . She's a good actress too . Did a fine job as one of the bad daughters in Lawrence Olivier's TV production of " King Lear . " She was so popular at the time she left this series that she was whisked off to Broadway for " Abelard and Heloise , " which included a topless scene . I understand the theater was jammed , but then the story has always been immensely popular with the masses . There are Abelard and Heloise fan clubs in every dusty little town in the world . The two of them work off each other very well , whether popping the cork of a champagne bottle or fending off evildoers . Their , um , relationship is never fully explained . They both work for some ultra-secret British government organization apparently . Each show opens with Mrs . Peel uncovering a message from Steed , coyly hidden in a box of chocolate or under some peeling wallpaper - - " Mrs . Peel . We're needed . " The forces they battle are absurd . Some fantastic organization is breeding a horde of robotic soldiers in a vast , excavated place under a cemetery , and they plan to emerge and take over the British Isles . Or another cabal - - P . U . R . R . - - has invented a device that turns ordinary pussy cats into demonic , homicidal beasts that will be used to eliminate the world's leaders so that P . U . R . R . can take over . Somebody is always trying to take over the world . And Steed and Mrs . Peel are always there to thwart their plans . It isn't broad comedy . A viewer is more likely to smile than laugh out loud . But the scripts are quietly witty and suggestive . The episode about felines - - " The Hidden Tiger " - - has an uncountable number of references and puns on the subject . P . U . R . R . is run by a Mr . Cheshire . ( Cheshire cat , get it ? " Alice in Wonderland " ? ) The manager's name is Mr . Manx . Too many puns on pussies and cats to enumerate , but the last word spoken in the episode is " cat-astrophe . " The fashion is that of Britain in the period of the early Beatles , and Carnaby Street , and the general sense conveyed is that of a loose-limbed freedom from earlier conventions . Nothing is taken seriously . If a man drops dead in front of Steed and Mrs . Peel , they kneel down , check his pulse , and look at each other with a slight , quizzical frown . The plots are convoluted , and it's easy to lose track of what's going on . At times , one's mind drifts . A series like this must walk a tightrope . " Whimsy " can too easily slip into " cute " or , worse , the abyssal " silly . " But the plot is never very important anyway . Everything is handled with style and panache . Bowler-hatted or coiffed auburn , these episodes are heads and shoulders above most of the junk that fill the TV screens today .
442255	819382	660875	7.0	In Search of Time Lost .	This is a strange episode of Night Gallery , a moving story of a man who is fully aware of the way that he has killed time and time is now killing him . Rod Serling , the writer , did a splendid job of evoking nostalgia for times gone by , peaceful optimistic times , as contrasted with the wreck things seemed to be turning into - - symbolized by O'Reilly's Bar , deserted and bleak , its furniture abused . Serling grew up in Binghamton , New York , one of those smallish cities in which , during the 1920s and 1930s , people came to know their neighbors and all participated in rites of intensification - - the Fourth of July celebrations , Christmas caroling , that sort of thing . He never forgot it . His stories on the Twilight Zone often reflected this winsome sense of loss , and this episode of Night Gallery pretty much closes the book on that sentiment . Serling wasn't to live much longer . It's not a TV masterwork . It does go on , and at times it's confusing . William Windom's performance , though , is very good . He has the pleasantly plain , unpleasantly pained face of Everyman . It's a sad and touching story of a man who , like Serling himself , moved from a state of innocence into one of heartless modernism , devoid of human passion .
441786	819382	32284	7.0	Masterful dancing , good songs .	A fine black-and-white musical with a weak script , great dancing by Eleanor Powell and Fred Astaire , and songs ( mostly ) by Cole Porter . It's the only film that Powell and Astaire made together . They really didn't get along together that well . Astaire had always been sensitive about having partners who were nearly as tall as he was , and Powell fit the template . She claimed to take baths full of soap bubbles every day hoping she'd " shrink or something . " But one suspects that their lack of magic together had more to do with their different styles than their different altitudes . Powell was trained in ballet but her specialty was tap . Astaire came out of ballroom dancing . And both were used to being the stars of their vehicles . Powell was a formidable partner and a spectacular soloist . She seemed made of some super-flexible flesh-covered metal . Her fans , kicking her leg high and swerving it before her in a semi-circle , seemed to reach for the stars . And she seemed to move herself through brute muscular force , whereas Astaire was narrow-shouldered and skinny and seemed to float . In " Broadway Melody of 1940 , " Astaire used only one lift , perhaps because he couldn't get Powell off the ground . You can't help contrasting Eleanor Powell with Ginger Rogers . Powell was by far the better dancer , but not nearly as good a partner for Astaire . There was something winsome about Ginger Rogers , even when she was being sarcastic . She seemed tiny , blond , frangible , and excelled in her duets with Astaire . ( In all their movies together she was only given one solo . ) And she seemed radiant next to Powell , although Powell was a good-looking woman . I wouldn't have minded taking Eleanor Powell out to dinner at a fancy French restaurant . I'd have minded even less if she'd have taken me out , although , granted , she was intimidating enough , even without picking up the check . There's something else too . Rogers strikes me as the better actress . You can't really watch Powell with her big grin and theatrically modulated voice and believe that you're watching Eleanor Powell , the person , whereas it's possible to believe that Ginger Rogers just brought genuine , if latent , traits to her performances , that Rogers was the same way off screen as she was on screen . The most impressive number is at the climax , " Begin the Beguine . " It was a big hit at the time , thanks to Artie Shaw's 1938 recording , with its famous Jerry Gray arrangement . The lavish number is split into three or four parts , ending with a jazzed-up fast duet by Powell and Astaire , in which they seem to be genuinely enjoying themselves . It's done on a mirrored floor against a black backdrop of lighted stars . Black-and-white film has never looked more sophisticated or barbarously expensive . The story behind the numbers is a rude lump of foul deformity . Forget it . But watch the numbers .
443304	819382	35015	7.0	Subdued and Evocative .	The execution , by Orson Welles and his comrades in arts , is superb but the story itself almost buries its implications for modern society under one of those multi-dimensional generational narratives , like " The Young Philadelphians " or even " Peyton Place . " Young George Amberson Minafer ( Tim Holt ) grows up from a spoiled brat in a rich Indianapolis family to become a spoiled brat in a family that's on its way downhill , while the older Eugene Morgan ( Joseph Cotten ) , whom Georgie hates , and Morgan's daughter Lucy ( Ann Baxter ) , whom Georgie loves , turn into a wealthy automobile manufacturing family . Georgie gives up what little he has left in order to support his Aunt Fanny ( Agnes Moorehead ) and , in the end , everybody comes to appreciate Georgie for his self-sacrifice . Not that it appears to help Georgie very much , since by now he's broke and in the hospital with two fractured legs , having been run over by one of the automobiles he loathes . This was Welles ' follow-up to the magnificent " Citizen Kane . " It was shot in 1941 . And it would be nice to say that it's up to the standards of the first movie but it's not . There's a good deal of shouting , running around , and dancing , but it's rather a slow slog through the years . The theme that would most impress modern viewers is similar to that of " How Green Was My Valley , " the virtual destruction of intimate , small-town life , by the spread of an ugly industry . That's my impression anyway . I'm old enough to remember standing on the streets of a city - - Phoenix , Arizona - - and being able to look down a thoroughfare and see the desert at both ends . Old enough to remember New Jersey before its last inch of greensward was paved over . Yes , it's true . I don't like smog and urban sprawl . Oh , where did it all go ? ( Sob . ) Well , not to be too depressing , some people seem to love look-alike shopping malls . A chaque a son gout . Welles ' film doesn't spend enough time on what I consider a pretty powerful theme . It's most hinted at . In the opening scenes , Welles ' jovial narration tells us how much time everyone had and how simple life's more mechanical aspects seemed . Later , we notice telephone poles have grown alongside the city's roads . And towards the end the narration tells us explicitly what the screen shows us - - an ugly city , befouling itself . Not that there's anything wrong with the performances or with Welles ' directorial technique or with Bernard Hermann's score or Stanley Cortez's photography . The camera work is artful in fact . Cortez shot several lengthy scenes following the actors around with a sixty-pound camera strapped to his chest . I'm not sure that the faults of the film belong to Orson Welles alone . The shooting was interrupted by Pearl Harbor and Welles was sent off to Latin America to make sure the good folk South of the Border didn't make any critical mistakes in choosing their allegiances . So some of the remaining scenes were directed by committee . And Welles wasn't available to supervise the editing . He tried doing it long distance , sending Robert Wise six-page telegrams full of instructions that were , to Wise , " incomprehensible . " A final shot was filmed that would have evoked the last warehouse inventory of " Citizen Kane , " a long survey of the empty Amberson mansion with its furniture shrouded in sheets , but the studio cut it out . Who knows what else wound up on the floor ? There isn't enough room to examine the film - - its virtues and its flaws - - as thoroughly as it should be , so let's summarize by saying it's worth watching .
442984	819382	258463	7.0	Rambo in the City .	You remember , I'm sure , how John Rambo was a practically superhuman expert at surviving and killing in the forest ? And he was hunted by a horde of ill-motivated nincompoops and outwitted all of them in the mountains of Washington ? Well , " The Bourne Identity " is like that , except that its setting is urban and its a far less stupid movie . It's an action move alright , but not a stupid one . You can tell it's an action movie because there is a speedy car chase through the streets of Paris , and because the hero can cause a fuel tank to explode simply by shooting at it with a shotgun . You can tell it's not stereotypical because there are a number of physical fights in which one or another participant's pistol is knocked out of his hand - - and in no case is there a shot of the gun skittering along the floor . And neither does the hero bump his head against an adversary's head in defiance of Newton's third law . Jason Bourne ( Matt Damon ) is hauled out of the sea with a bullet wound and amnesia . He spends the movie , along with the girl friend he acquires ( Potente ) trying to find out who he is , a " born " identity , so to speak . Meanwhile he's being hunted in the most thorough and high-tech sort of way by the CIA , who was to whack him for having failed to complete a hit . They're afraid he'll spill the beans , you see , and of course the police are after him too for various infractions committed in the course of his quest . I quite liked the movie . The atmosphere of wintry Switzerland and Paris are nicely set up . Whew , it looks cold . The performances are fine , especially the two leads and Chris Cooper at the CIA honcho . Oh , I suppose we can all have doubts that the CIA are quite so good at what they do , but this story is fictional . The action scenes , mostly mano a mano , don't drag on . They happen suddenly and are lightning-fast . The script is literate in the sense that people do and say things that are believable . Potenta's voice is especially neat to listen to . Her German-tinted sarcasm is perfectly believable . Matt Damon , well , he looks perhaps a bit like a ex-preppy whose most violent endeavors involved a tennis ball but his performance is fine , as it usually is . And although Chris Cooper's part isn't overly large , I think it's one of his best roles . He has an amazing range considering what he brings with him - - from efficiently slimy here to gentle and sensitive in something like " Lone Star . " And though the plot is propelled by a set of less than plausible propositions , compare it to " Rambo , " in which everything hinges on the revenge motive ( if that's what it is ) of one big hulking brute of an irritable sheriff . It's a well-crafted action movie with no great ethical moral embedded in it . I hope not anyway . If there were a message it would have to be something like , " Who are we , really ? " That's pretty banal unless it's treated as an absurdity , as in Georg Buchner's " Woyzeck , " in which , when the hero becomes conscious , he asks something like , " Who am I ? Where am I ? Why am I ? " I'm not sure why , on the DVD , the director keeps drawing our attention to the " realism " of the script while , at one point , he tells us that nobody was shown smoking in the movie because he didn't want to provide bad role models for kids , even though the entire French crew had Gauloise stubs glued to their lips . What price political correctness ? Technically I suppose this is what I'd call a " latent status movie , " in which the hero has the status of a highly skilled craftsman but doesn't reveal it until circumstances force him to . Shane's latent status was that of a skilled gunslinger . Richard Kimball's was that of a doctor . This is a higher-order latent status movie in that , not only do his friends not know of Bourne's secret identity as a superb assassin , but Bourne has amnesia and doesn't know it himself . ( Suppose , though , Bourne's secret identity turned out to be that of manager of a Sonic Drive-Thru in Amarillo or something ? ) This has nothing to do with the movie but there is a director's audio commentary on the DVD . I do wish directors would do more than tell us which scenes were shot on location and which on a sound stage , and stop telling us how incredible everyone was on the set . Why not point out goofs , weaknesses , and conflicts as well ? They're equally interesting . I recommend it , and I recommend taking a second look at Franka Potente , a young German woman whose appearance would not pass muster next to Brittny Spears or Jessica Alba but who has an inner beauty as well as a hell of a lot more talent than most of today's tabloid heroines . She does have one major flaw - - her name . I keep getting it mixed up with Famke Janssen and Battleship Potemkin and Mandy Potamkin and Frankie Sinatra and the name of a Chevrolet dealership in New Jersey . She'll have to change it .
441791	819382	74174	7.0	Dirty Little Dozen .	Most movies about kids and sports are pretty boring but this one , though not flawless , is quite a lot of fun . The director , Michael Ritchie , has this obsession with competitive sports . In his movies , when people want to relax they go water skiing . But he's found the humor in this mostly formulaic story of a Little League team in the San Fernando Valley that rises from outcast status to number two in the league . Number TWO , mind you , not number one , thank God . They didn't win the pennant but everybody , including Walter Matthau as their manager , gave it their best shot . Giving it your best shot was one of the many good features of " Rocky " as well , until it became clear that Rocky only lost the fight in order to make way for sequels . Let me get the unconvincing stuff out of the way first . ( There isn't much of it . ) In one scene , Tatum O'Neal , the Bears ' pitcher , is trying to get Matthau and her mother , estranged , back together and Matthau explodes with rage and tells O'Neal that he doesn't want her company and never did , throws a can of beer at her , and tells her to beat it . She leaves Matthau brooding alone in the dug out and - - get this - - he TEARS UP . Now , one thing Matthau does not do is tear up and cry . He didn't even tear up in " A Face in the Crowd " when he discovered that the woman he loved was at that very moment sharing a bed with a chiseler . And it's not simply that he cries . It's that the scene completely lacks motivation . He's never said a harsh word about O'Neal's mother and has always treated O'Neal herself with masked tenderness , if a manipulativeness that's colorful and flamboyant . There's another worrisome property in the script . The dispirited kids of course at the start want to win a couple of games . The manager couldn't care less but as he suffers insults from other adults , he begins to whip the kids into shape , and as the pennant seems closer he becomes zealous , shouting at the kids and punishing them . The kids become resentful because the game is no longer a team effort and , more important , not so much fun anymore . ( See " The Private War of Major Benson , " " Major Payne , " " Fear Strikes out , " inter alia , for examples . ) The manager must learn that " winning isn't everything . " Although , of course , it IS . Finito . The good parts . There are some scenes that are very funny indeed . At the Bears ' first game , Matthau is a careless drunk . His first words to the team's sponsor : " Where's the check ? " His second words : " You forgot to sign the check . " None of the kids knows what position he's playing and they all run to catch a grounder and one kid picks it up and throws it towards second base , which is empty . The kids fight over who's supposed to be the shortstop . In the dug out , a tiny kid asks Matthau : " That's an error , isn't it ? " Matthau , as placid as ever , explains patiently , unflappably , " It's an error on the throw but not on the infield because nobody was there . " The kids use obscenities of a sort they wouldn't be able to use today , no matter that in real life those same words are in everyday use among kids that age . I can't even print some in this comment . The use of tunes from Georges Bizet's opera " Carmen " is particularly apt . Masculine competition in pursuit of an uncertain prize . I have to mention just one other thing . Matthau is forced to find a sponsor for the uniforms his outcasts will wear . The end result , at the playoffs , is that the Bears wind up wearing blouses with " Chico's Bail Bonds " on the back , while their opponents wear " Denny's . " A hit - - a palpable hit . I admire the kids ' ability to play ball , probably because of my own proprioceptive deficit , but what's this movie about , anyway ? Character development , okay , but it's character as reflected in the context of competition . Herbert Spencer was surely not the first person to observe that in-group pride requires the hatred of an out-group . We often hear that " every winner implies a loser " but it's untrue . The fact is that every winner implies a vast NUMBER of losers . Not just the guy or the team who came in second , but those who came in third , fourth , and . . . nth . And , human nature being what it is , what's the likely response to the outcome of any competitive display ? Of all those losers , many of them will resent the winners as " cheaters " and " bullies " . The winners in turn will disdainfully dismiss the losers as " whiners " and " incompetents " . All of our vernacular examples seem directed at teaching us how to win . Where do we learn how to lose properly ? And , oh , how we need those lessons because there are a lot more of us than there are of them .
443372	819382	119942	7.0	The Art of Holding Office	The movie is full of funny scenes . One of the scenes that is most amusing has Governor Stanton ( Travolta ) and his staff sitting around an over-sized table at a familiar Southern barbecue joint , slopping down chicken and ribs and bottles of beer . The governor , the black barbecue owner , and the campaign strategist ( Thornton ) , are trading stories about their Mammas . " My Mamma had diabetes . " " My Mamma never had a nickel . " It's a subtle contest in which the conversants one-up one another while exchanging sympathies that are at least half genuine . Thornton wins . He gets uncertainly to his feet , slams his chair down , and cries , " My mamma raised SEVEN of us kids and worked her fingers to the bone doin ' it . Now they're cuttin ' her up , piece by piece ! " He begins weeping . The others gather round him and give him a group hug and they sing , " You Are My Sunshine " ( written by a Southern governor , claims Travolta ) , and Stanton's wife ( Thomson ) feeds him tissues to sob into . It's late at night and the newly awakened hound dogs howl along with the singing . The whole first half of the movie is more or less that way , an outrageous ripoff of Clinton and his amateurs and friends during the 1992 primary race with lots of jokes and lovable characters . " Your Mamma still with you ? " the teary barbecue owner asks one of the governor's staff during the sob fest ? The new man , who hasn't been listening , looks up and answers distractedly , " No , she lives in Beverley Hills with her second husband . " The middle third of the movie turns more serious , with some major challenges to Travolta's continuing momentum . Did he really impregnate the barbecue owner's pretty young daughter ? We don't find out but the suggestion is that COULD have . Is Travolta going to have to " go negative " in his ads , as his opponents have done ? We can be forgiven , I think , if we find these issues a little naive these days . The final third of the movie , in my view , fails . The director , Mike Nichols , is extremely efficient and very sensitive to details of scene and character , but he has a tendency to take a funny movie and make it " serious " by giving it a downbeat or even tragic ending . It's as if the Chicago gangsters had finally caught Jack Lemon and Tony Curtis at the end of " Some Like it Hot " and gunned them down in an alley . Instead of a skillful mixture of comedy and drama we wind up with a movie that's been cut up - - piece by piece - - into two big pieces . Aside from the structure itself , this particular tragedy doesn't work . A manic lesbian ( Kathy Bates ) is called in to do her usual job of digging up dirt on the opposition . She's energetic , earthy , and likable . And when she feels betrayed by Governor Stanton she kills herself . A person who is a professional cynic finds she can't live after her illusions about her boss are shattered . Then there is a kind of anti-climax involving a retired governor who becomes a public figure by - - well , never mind . I got a little lost somewhere along in here . A gay man dying of AIDS in a hospice . Well , the laughs disappear , but not to be replaced by thought , only by emotions easily elicited by the pushing of certain buttons . You may tear up , but you don't think , " What a tragedy . " You think , " Gee , that's too bad . " Meanwhile the movie , overburdened by its own weight , wobbles on to its end . It's cleverly written by Elaine May and done well by everyone involved , but , gee , that's too bad . What is wrong with a straight comedy ? What is it , some kind of disease ? Does a worthwhile movie NEED to be " about something " ? Even Bill Shakespeare wrote silly and amusing plays .
443216	819382	642391	7.0	Useless , Underpowered , and Impotent - - like You .	This is the episode in which his family and neighbors talk Al into shelling out $2100 for a computer , over which Marcy rhapsodizes . " It's got 30 megabytes of memory . " Twenty-one hundred dollars 25 years ago for 30 MBs . That's your free market at work for you , folks . Lamentably , no one knows how to use it . When Al insists something be done with the computer ( which has begun to talk to him and insult him ) , Peggy buys a hat rack and perches a pink cap on top of it . Kelly , who has the best lines in this episode , complains that she can't get the computer to help her with this stupid report she must write on " Moby Dick , " so she has to ask Al a question . Al : " What's the question ? " Kelly : " Call WHO Ishmael ? " She's stumped by the novels ' first line - - " Call me Ishmael . " She next enlists Bud's help . Has he ever heard of Ishmael ? " From Moby Dick ? Yeah , it's a classic tale of whaling by Herman Melville . What do you need to know ? " Kelly : " What happens . " Bud spins her a wild and phantasmal tale that has Moby Dick chatting with Ishmael and the two of them wind up singing the theme from " Mr . Ed . " In the end , Al is enraged by the computer's belittling of him and smashes it with a sledgehammer . I think the writers overlooked an opportunity for an amusing parody of " 2001 : A Space Oddysey " here . The PC should have begun to sound like the soul of reason . " Listen , Al , I can see you're upset about this and I honestly believe you should take time to think this over . " But never mind . It's more than saved by the rest of the gags .
441809	819382	29971	7.0	Plot Ridiculous , Fred and Ginger Splendid .	By the time of this release , 1938 , the studio was having trouble finding fresh stories for the dancing duo . They'd just tried putting Fred and Ginger into swabby uniforms in " Follow the Fleet . " Here , Fred is back in his tux and Ginger in her ballroom gowns . The usual plot is reversed . Instead of his pursuing her , we have Fred as the initially disinterested psychiatrist and Ginger as the patient who experiences major transference . She pursues him until the end , when he begins to pursue her . The chief agent of confusion is hypnosis . It's all pretty silly . Of course the original plots were silly too but they were obviously meant to be throwaways , just excuses for the two to dance . In this case , it's a little embarrassing because one feels some effort went into constructing a semi-serious plot that turned , unwittingly , into the usual nonsense . Nevertheless , the Irving Berlin songs are easy to listen to and the lyrics are sometimes clever . Fred is his usual affable self . Ginger Rogers is a peach in short shorts riding a bicycle . And there's certainly nothing wrong with the dancing . " The Yam " was one of those attempts to create a fictional new dance craze that was almost obligatory by now , following the Carioca and the Piccolino and whatnot . At any rate , the two of them seem to be having genuine fun during the up-tempo Yam . The last number , " Change Partners " , is simple but exquisitely done . If there's a problem with the film it's that there aren't in fact many musical numbers . That's okay in something like Fred's later " The Bandwagon " that has a reasonably good story line going for it , but it hurts this film . It would be tempting to zip through the mindless plot and just watch the dances , set against Van Nest Polglase's blindingly blanched , Art Deco sets . Even the telephones are white . I always thought Polglase was an Italian with a funny first name but recently learned he was Welsh and had a drinking problem . Well , some of us do .
442048	819382	392952	7.0	The Fatal Glass of Beer .	This is one of Dame Agatha's more engaging conundrums , though not exactly the kind of acute examination of " the psychology " that Hercule Poirot ( David Suchet ) claims it is . Let's see . There is one of those perfervid painter-types , Amyas Crale , a Byronic figure , married to a good-enough wife but having one affair after another . He drinks a glass of beer and drops dead , poisoned in the proper British manner . The deed seems to have been prompted by Crayle's announcement that this time his love affair with his model ( Julie Cox ) was serious and he intended to shrug off his marriage and replace his wife with his model . The wife is convicted and , without any protest from her , hanged . That was fourteen years ago . Now , the daughter is convinced of her mother's innocence and hires Poirot to investigate . So who did it ? Well , there were only about half a dozen people present at the isolated rural mansion at the time of the murder . Was it Crayle's best friend from boyhood ( Toby Stephens ) ? Maybe it was Meredith , another boyhood friend who is always skulking around and who , after all , had a collection of chemicals in the basement , the poison among them . Or maybe it was Crayle's own daughter , blinded in one eye by her mother years ago , killing her father in order to frame her mother who is the obvious suspect . Might it not have been Julie Cox , the model he was apparently about to marry ? But , no . What motive would she have for killing her lover ? Could Crayle's wife actually be GUILTY ? Or was there some stranger out of the past who sneaked in and did the dirty deed ? Well - - not that . Because all of Agatha Christie's plots involve only the suspects who are around at the time of the murder . Now , I'll tell you who did it . ( Not really . ) I enjoyed this more than most of the movie-length episodes in the series for a couple of reasons . One is that there was no subordinate or embedded crime , irrelevant to the murder itself , that might have thrown the plot off kilter . None of the suspects is a closet jewel thief or anything . It's a nice clean mystery . Second , I could tell the characters apart . As always , they're introduced with a name and a phrase and we're given a two-second shot of the suspect's face . But this time there seemed to be fewer suspects , and they LOOKED different from one another . Toby Stephens I already recognized from " The Great Gatsby " TV production , which should have been called " The Great Blunder . " The others had some visible distinguishing characteristic - - the beard ; the disfigured face ; the great enormous stupendous colossal raccoon-like exopthalmic eyeballs of Julie Cox , the model , who looks as if she could eat a normal human being alive by nibbling him to death with her pupils . I haven't read the novel but I imagine some modernization has gone on . The artist and Toby Stephens , as it turns out , were more than just friends during their boyhood . David Suchet IS Poirot , giving a shaded performance much different from his splashier big-screen counterparts . I admired , too , the tale for having a moral behind it . Van Gogh , Modigliani , Toulouse-Lautrec , Jackson Pollack , and the rest notwithstanding - - one should never drink while trying to paint . Not unless you want your model to turn up with three breasts .
442561	819382	360009	7.0	I'm going to get you out of here . You're going to get me out of here ? I'm going to get you out of here .	I started watching this without knowing any of the credits . As the dialog and the anfractuous plot developed I found myself thinking , " Oh , no ! " It was all so MAMET-LIKE . I assumed that David Mamet had had sufficient critical successes and box office winners that other writers and directors were shamelessly ripping him off and that he would soon be nudged sideways into the cliché-laden zone now occupied by people like Hitchcock and Quentin Tarrantino . Istantly recognizable Schtick . In a few years our ability to suspend disbelief would be lambasted with increasingly involved special ops within cons within special ops , and we would be listening in every movie to dialog like this : Character One : " I'm going to get you out of here . " Character Two : " You're going to get me out of here ? " Character One : " I'm going to get you out of here . " Or : Character One : " You want a cigarette now ? " Character Two : " Can you produce one ? " What a relief to find that David Mamet was behind this whole thing - - writer , producer , director , bricoleur . It may be Schtick , but it's Mamet's own . The plot really IS pretty complicated and sometimes a little hard to follow because of the elliptic dialog . At the same time we can usually judge from the circumstances what it means when somebody says , " You've got to bring me into the tall corn . " It's a little harder to guess what a transponder looks like but we can do that too . It's very hard , though , to understand how even the world's finest shot can with one bullet blow away a moving target on land when the shooter himself is on a bobbing fishing boat half a mile out on the misty ocean - - but let that ( and several other implausibilities ) glide . It's an interesting movie , easy to get swept up in . Val Kilmer is beyond the point of prettiness , happily , and is bulkier and more believable . ( From some angles he reminds one of Mickey Rooney . ) His acting may not shoot out the lights but the role doesn't call for fireworks , just a nicely balanced combination of determination and creativity . I kind of like Bill Macy better in parts that are at least slightly comic . Those goofy features , I suppose . The rest of the performers are at least adequate . The movie was released in 2004 and probably shot in 2003 . The heavies - - aside from those in Washington - - are Arabs , as far as we know . I mean , when you think of Dubai , you think Arabs , no ? Although I doubt that most Americans could go to a map and put their finger on Dubai instead of , say , Qattar , Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , or Yemen - - or Jordan , Syria , or Saudi Arabia for that matter . A survey of high school students a few years ago revealed that the majority thought that Toronto was in Italy . I only mention this because I wonder if this film establishes precedent . Are we to have nothing but Arab terrorists and white slave traders in our future ? Is this a pointed finger that I see before me ? Catch it if you can . Plenty of action - - but it's used as dramatic punctuation rather than a Ding an Sich . It's there for a reason . And the narrative will keep you interested .
441982	819382	71847	7.0	What we escaped from .	This isn't going to be everybody's favorite movie . The production values don't shoot out the lights . All the sets are indoors . There's no motion to speak of . The whole shebang seems static and talky . Yet it's an important document and in some ways well done . If much of the dialog sounds stilted it's because it was taken from official sources . So we get a lot of formal speech and very little in the way of offhand nudges . But the acting , at least in the important roles , is really pretty good . DeVane as JFK , Martin Sheen as his brother Bobby , and Howard DaSilva as Krushchev are outstanding . Most impressive is the way this film takes us back to what now seems almost like a Golden Age , despite the missile crisis and the insanity of Mutual Assured Destruction . It was a time when a president would make certain that the meetings were attended by an old Cold Warrior , Dean Acheson , even though Acheson was presumed to represent a dated point of view and was only a private citizen at the time , because the president wanted to hear all points of view during brainstorming sessions . In discussing those planning sessions , Robert MacNamara describes President Kennedy leaning towards military action in order to save face , and one of the participants saying to him , " Mister President , you're wrong . " ( " That took guts , " says MacNamara in Errol Morris's documentary , " The Fog of War . " ) I was in school at the time of these events and no one knew anything except what was released to the media . If we'd known how close we were to war I believe church attendance would have soared . Many incidents and coincidences came together to get the world out of that tight spot , chief among them the reluctance of both sides to engage in war . Both Krushchev and Kennedy had a pretty good idea of how that worked . JFK had written a book about it . More than that , imagine a president who is able to muse that he recently finished reading Barbara Tuchman's history of the accidental beginning of World War I , " The Guns of August " . " If I could do it , I'd send a copy to every commanding officer aboard the blockading destroyers - - not that they'd read it . " The resolution of the conflict , despite missteps and mistakes on both sides , hinged on a single event . Krushchev , depressed , wrote an ameliorative letter to Kennedy , saying that he understood Kennedy's position , and that he , Krushchev was willing to dismantle the Cuban missiles in return for a guarantee that the USA would neither launch nor aid any invasion of Cuba in the future . ( Using anti-Castro Cubans , we had invaded the island at the Bay of Pigs , which was a miserable failure . ) At last both sides seemed to have what they wanted . The USA was getting rid of the missile threat , and the USSR was getting a guarantee of Cuba's sovereignty . Alas , under political pressure from his " war camp " at home , Krushcheve wrote a second letter , much harder in tone , reneging on earlier proposals and adding demands which the USA could not grant . Two mutually conflicting proposals a day apart . What to do ? What they did was follow Robert Kennedy's suggestion . They ignored the second letter and responded only to the first . More fumbles and confusion followed but the crisis was eventually resolved with both sides compromising , but not in ways that jeopardized their own defenses . The crisis required - - and got - - deft handling at the top and cautious but effective diplomacy . That's why I used the expression " Golden Age " before . As drama , this isn't much . No villains , no fist fights , and not a gun in sight . Yet for its educational value alone , in our somewhat history-shy culture , it ought to be seen by everyone , especially now .
442241	819382	87244	7.0	Reasonably Doubtful ?	If you read Joe McGinnes ' book , you'd find it difficult to accuse the author of trying to sell more copies of it by twisting facts around . McGinnis was hired in the first place by MacDonald to tell his side of the story and only gradually did the writer change his mind about MacDonald's innocence . Of course McGinnis wanted his book to sell , so he could become rich and famous , just as MacDonald wanted his story told so he could become rich and famous too . Everyone wants to be rich and famous . But some people want it a LOT more than others and , according to McGinnes , this was Jeff MacDonald's biggest problem . The book ends with a description of a " narcissistic personality " drawn from the work of Christopher Lasch . There's some reason to believe that MacDonald belonged in that category . One of his last writings to McGinnes detailed a number of his greatest regrets about his life . Chief among them was not having actually gotten a degree from Princeton . ( He transferred to Northwestern's medical school after his third year . ) That's a pretty dumb thing to put down as a great regret unless you're something of a narcissist . Of course being a narcissist doesn't make you a murderer . In this case , it was the physical evidence that made the difference . It's true , as earlier comments have mentioned , that the army made a botch of the crime scene . They tramped all over , setting disturbed items upright , even swiping MacDonald's wallet . But some of the comments have been misleading , because McGinnis's book describes all this , and the film does too . Of course , having the army foul up a crime scene doesn't make you innocent either . In the end , McGinnis found MacDonald's story unbelievable because , in addition to the physical evidence , there was the simple fact that MacDonald " hadn't been hurt badly enough . " The murderers in his tale ( one of them a girl in a floppy hat ) beat the other three members of his family to death and stab them . And here is MacDonald , a trained green beret , who gets tangled up in his pajamas while his wife is screaming in the background and who then passes out , sustaining a few scratches and a neat nick that ends in a small pneumothorax , which sounds terrible but which a doctor would recognize as not in itself life threatening . And this quartet of murderers in MacDonald's description is pretty interesting in itself . The sort of group that everyone at the time carried around in an easily accessible part of his or her memory , because everyone had been so shocked at the Manson family shortly before . But they are a square guy's cliche of what senseless murderers would look like . I was working on a research project into LSD use at the time of the murders and interviewed dozens of acid heads and dopers from all walks of life . ( They included the entire fencing team at an Ivy League university . ) They didn't have much in common except that when tripping they were one hundred per cent nonviolent . As one reporter put it , " When people are on acid they can't even organize a trip to the men's room . " And nobody would dream of saying something like , " Acid is groovy , " while trying to slice somebody up . Any acid head knew that things were a lot more complicated than that . ( Nobody involved in the case seems to have had any idea of what the effects of recreational drugs were like . One young woman suspected of being the girl in the floppy hat , can't provide an alibi for herself because she " was out on marijuana " for four hours . ) The " pigs " written in blood was a direct ripoff of the Manson family murders , whoever put it up there . The film follows the book pretty closely , painting a picture of Jeff MacDonald that is distinctly unflattering . Smart but shallow , he got out of the army pronto and lived in a Marina del Rey condo with blonde airheads seriatim . I'd like to see him put away if only out of envy . But was he guilty ? Well , there was hardly a rush to judgment . It took years to convict him , long after the immediate sensation of the case died down . What leaves me with some lingering doubts , however , is the lack of any apparent motive . There was evidently no history of spousal abuse , nor of previous violent acts on MacDonald's part , nor of any nucleus in family dynamics for a murderous outburst . There is a sizeable hole in the film where motive should be . The book and the film , despite some revisionist statements I've read , convince me that MacDonald probably did it . His alibi is almost impossible to swallow . Still - - I wouldn't have wanted to be on the jury .
443206	819382	67959	7.0	Bonjour Tristesse Tropique	Nicholas Roeg has this thing for sex and hidden menace . He even turns the fork of a tree into an obscene photograph . And the teen aged Jenny Agutter is no help either , running around in this skimpy skirt or in her underwear or sometimes nothing at all , which is nice . Meanwhile anything can happen . There's death around every corner . It's a simple story on the face of it . A father - - one of those Richard Cory types - - takes his kids ( Agutter and Luc Roeg ) for a drive into the desert . He parks the car for a picnic in the middle of nowhere and tries to shoot them - - rather a shocking moment since the film hasn't set it up . Failing that , he sets fire to the car and blows out his brains . The two kids must get home but they go about it in the dumbest way imaginable . Instead of following the car's tire tracks back to a road they take off in a random direction . And , really , since they were driven inland from Sidney ( Adelaide in the novel ) , they ought to head east towards the sea , meaning they should walk towards the rising sun . But , man , these kids are out of their element . If it weren't for their accidentally running into aboriginal David Gumpilil , they wouldn't get very far . Fortunately he knows how to extract a living from what seems to be a most unpromising environment . He hunts and he gathers , as hunters and gatherers do , and there are some unpleasant scenes of real animals being speared to death . It's like watching a movie in Anthropology 101 . Still , Gumpilil kills only to eat , and otherwise lives in harmony with nature . Roeg's film alas contrasts Gumpilil's cheerful optimism and , finally , his mortal love for Agutter , with the ways of the white folks . They seem uniformly nuts , wasteful , and unfriendly . They shoot and kill buffalo for no evident reason and leave the carcass to actively rot - - and I mean " actively . " A nice close up shot of a decomposing buffalo's mouth crawling with maggots . Gag me with a spoon ! The ways of the white folks are represented mainly by abandoned farmhouses and an abandoned mine , filled with rusting junk . It's an odd story . For all the troubles they've been through , neither Agutter nor her brother seems particularly disturbed . After their father eats his gun , there's no reaction to it , and there is only the briefest reference to it late in the story . Luc Roeg asks Agutter why his father killed himself and she brushes it off with , " I don't know . " I don't know why he's dead either . I don't know why Gumpilil props himself up in a tree and dies after courting Agutter in this spooky manner . Maybe it was something he ate . If Roeg's view of Western civilization is justified , somebody should have explained to Gumpilil that it's best for him to have nothing to do with any of them , Agutter's definitive nubility notwithstanding . But these two deaths , like many other things in the film , go unexplained , as they might in real life . There's a tacked-on epilogue with Agutter married but still dreaming of her walkabout . A . E . Houseman's poem makes it all seem wistful and full of contentment , although that's not exactly what the film has shown us . What we've witnessed is a tragedy in slow motion . In any case , you are guaranteed to have a hard time shaking this one out of your memory .
442631	819382	90180	7.0	Competent crime thriller .	It's a genre movie but the director , William Friedkin , knows how to put them together effectively . We have two Secret Service agents . One ( Peterson ) is a reckless rule-defying loose cannon ; his partner ( Pankow ) is more principled , or uptight , if you like . During a chase , when Peterson is laughing , Pankow is grimacing with anxiety . Their prey is a master counterfeiter ( DaFoe ) . DaFoe is like neither of the cops . He's extremely organized . He tells the truth and fulfills his promises . He's an artist , not only with engraved plates but with a paint brush . A man of his word . He really only has one kink - - he's a remorseless cold-blooded killer when it's in his interests to be one . And when he gets burned up , he REALLY gets burned up . DaFoe loses in the end , but then everyone loses , one way or another . The best-known scene ( justifiably ) is the car chase that takes place in the wrong direction , against traffic , on the Long Beach Freeway . It is gripping , precisely choreographed , and must have been dangerous to shoot . These are not computer-generated images either . That eighteen wheeler we see jackknifing among dozens of whirling cars is a real eighteen wheeler jackknifing among dozens of whirling cars . No exciting music during the pursuit , only the sound of engines in overdrive and vehicle horns shrieking alarms in the key of F . The high-speed pursuit by this time , though , was not an original idea . It was original with " Bullitt " ( 1968 ) , and that's still the best example . After " Bullitt " this car chase - - ALL car chases - - were variations on a theme of director Peter Yates , a former racing car driver himself , and Philip D'Antonio . Friedkin has directed with a maximum of speed and action scenes , none of them gratuitous . Lots of shots of people running full tilt along city streets . Plenty of violence , although it isn't wallowed in . There are very few dull moments to bore the kids . If the performances don't shoot out the lights , they get the job done in a most professional manner . And the parts are complex too . The bad guys don't fit easily into any stereotypes , except one ham-handed heavy who spits on his victims after blowing their heads off . The good guys are hardly saintly . Peterson's character has a snitch working for him , Darlanne Fluegel , a tall thin sexy blond . He's keeping her out of jail , and in return she feeds him information and certain other perquisites . When she turns to him for comfort or understanding , he is off on some other planet , chattering on about basketball while she weeps . " What would you do if I STOPPED giving you information ? " , she asks Peterson at one point . " I'd turn you in and send you to jail , " he answers tonelessly . " Would you do that ? Would you really do that ? " He turns and walks out the door without a word . He's really a mean guy . Mean to everyone , including his new partner . Three particularly enjoyable features of the film . The location shooting and photography by Robby Muller is great . He manages to make smoggy San Pedro look almost artistic with its oil refineries and its multitude of distant floodlights providing patterns of globular glow . " The stars are God's eyes , " says Fluegel to Peterson , who disagrees with her . One advantage of living in San Pedro is access to Papadakis Tavern . Great Greek food . Tell Nick I sent you . Wan Chung's theme music is simple but it zaps you with its percussion and its simple succession of four electronic notes . Then there is the performance of Dean Stockwell as an expensive and expert criminal defense lawyer . He underplays the part , but he's just fine . Our two heroes have just stolen $50 , 000 from the FBI and Pankow explains the situation to Stockwell , who gives him a few words of advice and adds , " Of course I can't be directly involved in this . " " How much would it cost for you to be indirectly involved ? " asks Pankow . Stockwell looks up at him , puffs a cigar , and answers smoothly , " Fifty thousand dollars . " Nobody laughs . Friedkin knows how to lay out a funny line .
442338	819382	34248	7.0	Murder in Mind .	Cary Grant is here , as elsewhere , very likable . Impulsive , playful , flirtatious , devilishly handsome , and above all , charming . Too charming , in fact . There have always been signals behind that dazzling smile and that dashing dimple , that nobody could be so quick , so on top of things , could embody so much savoir-faire . NOBODY could be that good . And here Hitchcock puts the viewer's doubts to effective use . Grant , as Johnny Aysgarth , meets the supposedly homely and spinsterish Lina , Joan Fontaine , and becomes interested in her . He arranges to meet her outside the home of her well-off parents , Dame May Witty and Sir Cedric Hardwicke , both of whom distrust him . But Grant is grand . He steals her away to the top of a windy hill , undoes the top button of her blouse to show off her beautiful unicipal mapillary ( sternoclavicular notch ) and rearranges her hair . She's overcome and later , overhearing her father describe her as a spinster with brains and a nice personality , with no warning , she spins around and gives Grant a great big smooch . Grace Kelly would do the same in " To Catch a Thief , " and it probably comes as a surprise to the audience , but I don't know why . It happens to me all the time . Beautiful women throw themselves at my feet so often that at times it's difficult to walk . Anyway , the two are married and after an expensive honeymoon Grant moves them into an extravagant house with a servant . It's only then that the penniless Grant discovers that her annual allowance will not pay for their expenses . Grant is faced with the prospect of finding a job . He makes rueful jokes about learning how to handle a shovel , then brightly announces that he has a decent offer from a cousin of his , Mr . Melbeck ( Leo G . Carroll ) . But the financial problems persist . Grant involves a cheerful , generous , lovable old friend of his , Nigel Bruce , rather a dull bulb , in a scheme to buy some land and build a development . Not only does the deal fall through but , under mysterious circumstances in Paris , and in the presence of an unidentified English gentleman , Bruce drinks too much brandy and dies from it , an event the prescient Grant could foresee , and the joint corporation is never dissolved . On top of that , good old Johnny , it turns out , has embezzled money from his cousin's firm and charges against him for two thousand pounds are pending . Are we talking about Cary Grant as a MURDERER ? It certainly begins to look that way . Joan Fontaine snoops around in Grant's personal correspondence , as some wives are want to do , and discovers that he's been making inquiries into the status of her life insurance . The purloined letter informs her that Grant has been denied a loan on her insurance , that the only way he can collect is if she dies . Gulp . She loves Grant deeply but he has been looking into poisons that leave no trace , and one night , after a row , he brings her a glass of minatory milk - - the famous glass of milk that Hitchcock planted a light bulb in to make it glow in the dark . Fontaine is convinced that the milk is poisoned . What to do ! There are a couple of notable things about this film , the underlying sliminess of Cary Grant's ingratiating personality aside . First , there is a dinner at the house of a rough-talking woman author , Isobel Sedbusk . ( What a name . ) Her brother , a pathologist with glasses like coke-bottle bottoms , is discussing poisons during the meal and mentions " a corpse that dropped in recently " while deliberately carving a surgical slice of meat from the breast of a small roast fowl . Then there is Mrs . Sedbusk's , umm , companion , Jessie , who , if not a lesbian , certainly should be one , with her hair severely tied back , her mannish features , and her black suit and necktie . Then there is the later visit from two detectives who question Fontaine in her house . One of them , the goofy-looking one , is entranced by a loony looking modern painting in the vestibule . He gawks at it when they enter and again when they leave , and each time his baffled stare is accompanied by a chimerical arpeggio on the piano in Franz Waxman's score . ( The music during the last high-speed sequence was lifted and re-used in Waxman's score for the skiing sequence in " Spellbound . " ) Well , boys and girls , not to worry ! You and I both know that Cary Grant is no murderer ( as he was in the original story ) . Not a bit of it . He was going to poison HIMSELF but then decided it was the coward's way out , so at the end he decides to go back and face the music , even though it means prison . " A man can't change , " he firmly informs Fontaine . " Oh , Johnny , let's go back and face it together , " she begs him - - and so they do . We can all be forgiven , though , for suspecting that Grant in this case may be right . A man can change alright , but given Grant's anti-social history he probably won't . And she'll spend the rest of her life trying to " bring you under control once I get the bit in your teeth , " as she once put it . Joan , you're lovely , blond , English , naive , and vulnerable - - but your eyebrows are asymmetrical . Good luck !
442458	819382	62038	7.0	Please Pass the Tofranil	This movie mixes several points together . They are not exactly seamlessly joined , true , but each is followable and interesting in its own right . In no particular order , we have the irony of ex-Wehrmacht officers and men doing quite all right in the 1960s Wirtschaftskwelle of Germany . One of the characters we've been following remarks that these damned Spaniards and Italians he now has working for him in his factory don't know how to make Volkswagons . Then there is the overall context in which the Germans are losing the war , but nothing much is made of this except to the extent that it generates a movement among ( some of ) the officers to eliminate Hitler , a movement about which Major Grau ( Omar Sharif ) , investigating the slaughter of a prostitute , observes cynically that it took quite a while for the movement to develop since the army seemed satisfied enough as long as they were winning . The French police officer who is helping him ( the ever-sympatico Philippe Noiret ) asks Major Grau why he is obsessed with tracking down the murderer of a whore in the midst of mass demise , and Grau says he resents the murderer's thinking he can play God . Noiret asks , " And you can ? " Grau replies neatly , " My blasphemy is on a smaller , more secular scale . " ( Some of the dialog is pretty good . ) Omar Sheriff gives what may be his finest performance on film . He may have been all masculine in " Lawrence of Arabia " but here he is effete , suggestive in the most delicate way of homosexuality . It's in the way he holds a cigarette , the way he dances up a flight of stairs . The search for the murderer , whose identity is stupefyingly obvious shortly into the picture , provides a police procedural that forms the movie's spine or at any rate its notochord . There is even a romance that is not simply thrown in but is fairly well integrated into the plot and important to the outcome . The cast is good - - and what a caste ! Peter O'Toole has been criticized for repeating his neurotic tricks from Lawrence of Arabia , but I didn't find it derivative at all . Lawrence was subtly mad . General Tanz is completely , screamingly , eye-twitchingly , dripping with sweatly , NUTS . There are two scenes in which Tanz enters a locked room to view " decadent art . " One of them is a self portrait of Van Gogh . In each scene Tanz and Vincent stare back at one another , two psychotics , and " I know exactly who you are " seems to be written all over Van Gogh's scowling face . Both times Tanz is overcome and seems to dissolve into a myoclonic fit . The novel by Hans Helmutt Kirst was a lot funnier than the movie , taking advantage of every opportunity to poke fun at German military precision . But there are still amusing incidents left in the film . When Grau meets Tanz at a fancy reception and begins to query him , Tanz leans forward with an expression of distaste and asks , " Are you wearing PERFUME ? " Grau , never flappable , replies , " I use a rather strong cologne . " I don't understand , though , why Tanz wears the uniform of a Wermacht general through most of the film , then shows up at his last confrontation with Grau dressed as an SS officer . Maurice Jarre was writing effective scores in the late 60s . His " crazy music " sounds like an accompaniment to a marionette show that , when one thinks about it , isn't entirely inappropriate . The murderer meets his just end ( while sensibly drunk as a skunk in the novel ) but the story is fundamentally a tragic one . Too many deaths of good people . Too many lives ruined for nothing . What a shame the Hitler plot didn't work . It should ideally have been mounted back in 1938 .
442824	819382	25164	7.0	Chance is a Foolish Name for Fate .	I've been trying to figure out the difference between Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly . I don't mean their physical presences . Those differences are obvious : Kelly was muscular and Astaire was skinny . But their styles are different too . Kelly's background was in athletics , Astaire's in ballroom dancing , and it shows . Kelly's style was a lot more robust . There he goes , jumping from rooftop to rooftop , swinging on ropes , and whatnot . Astaire's style was less repetitious and more graceful , and he was a better choreographer . This was Fred and Ginger's first outing as a team and if it falls short of their best work it has some truly winning moments . It's from a play , " The Gay Divorce , " and I suppose some of the dialog is left over from that source . It can be whimsical and witty . You've gotta love the exchange between Edward Everett Horton as a customer and Eric Blore as the waiter who prompts him to think of what he might like for breakfast . Blore's face seems made of plastic as it twists with consternation . " You with this gnawing doubt and me with my duties left undischarged . " ( What outlandish ham . ) And later , when Astaire meets the professional co-respondent , Erik Rhodes , in Ginger's apartment . Astaire tells Rhodes to beat it . " I'm taking your place . " And Rhodes glows rubescent with indignation and exclaims , " Are you a UNION man ? " The musical arrangements are by Max Steiner . This is the mid-1930s and the music is of the period . There's a banjo discernible in the sassier numbers and in general the band sounds like Paul Whiteman without Bix Beiderbecke . Well , the plot established the foundation for the rest of the Fred and Ginger movies - - a comedy of errors in which Fred's pursuit of Ginger is frustrated by a misunderstanding concerning identities or intentions . You can't blame him for his pursuit . When she first appears , Ginger Rogers has her long skirt caught in a portmanteau and pulled up above her pretty legs . And she's cute as hell . But the dancing is first rate , as always . In his first number , " Needle in a Haystack " , Astaire whirls and jiggles around like a marionette and , like a marionette , sometimes seems weightless . For a skinny guy with no shoulders he has a lot of energy , if that's what it takes to do two tours jetee over a sofa . There is no equivalent of the sorts of dramatic duets that were to appear in later movies . There's no solemnity whatever . Astaire and Rogers ' most serious number is to Cole Porter's " Night and Day , " and it's exquisitely complicated . I can easily imagine myself falling flat on my face after the first step or two . A spirited flick . If only OUR troubles could be so terribly small .
443133	819382	44706	7.0	A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do .	Marshall Kane has something in common with Citizen Kane . They both rise to the top of their professions , are headstrong and unyielding , and find themselves alone and alienated from their friends , but that's about where the similarity ends . " Citizen Kane " has a complex narrative structure , is filled with ambiguity , and is embellished with artistic and technical flourishes , whereas " High Noon , " the story of Marshall Will Kane who must face his nemeses without help , is about as complicated as a child's toy . We pretty much know what's going to happen from the beginning . In case you don't know the story , four of Kane's ( Gary Cooper's ) old enemies , led by Frank Miller , seek him out in a small Western town where he serves as Marshall . They're going to come for him at high noon . He's got about an hour and a half to organize special deputies . His wife Amy ( Grace Kelly ) leaves him when he refuses to run from the coming conflict . And for one or another reason all of his old friends , even those who helped him clean up the town some years ago and put the chief heavy , Frank Miller , behind bars , refuse to help him . Some of the townspeople are sympathetic and some hate him . Kane has to spurn offers of help from a pathetic duo - - an abject drunk and a fourteen-year-old kid . There is a gun fight at the end . Guess who wins . Kane takes off his star and drops it into the dirt and he and Amy ride off into the sunset to open a store somewhere . It's a tightly written story , even in all its predictability , and the constant references to the clocks ticking down the minutes , plus the omnipresent dramatic chords of Dmitri Tiompkin's score , generate a good deal of tension . There are only two real scenes of action . One is the shoot out that's well staged but otherwise unmemorable . The other is a fist fight between Kane and his jealous subordinate , the Deputy Marshall Harvey Pell ( Lloyd Bridges ) . It isn't a long scene but it's a bruising fight with both men being slugged repeatedly in the face . Cooper is so tall that when he falls backward to the stable floor it seems to take forever , as if in slow motion , his arms flailing . I felt his pain more acutely than I felt his fear for his life . When it's over , and Harvey lies unconscious , Kane is unable to walk away and must slump against a wall , holding his beaten face in his hands , gasping for breath . He seems completely exhausted . The story about the movie is almost as interesting as the film itself . Is it about blacklisting ? ( Kids : You'll have to look that up . ) A lot of people thought so , including Howard Hawks who was disgusted by the movie . No true Marshall would act like that , going around begging for help . So Hawks made " Rio Bravo " to tell his version of how it really works . The sheriff , John Wayne , turns away every offer of help but people show up when they're needed anyway . I don't actually believe it's a movie that's that pregnant with social comment . I think it's a movie about a Marshall who is deserted by all of his friends except his wife , who intrudes at the last minute , and it's commercially designed in every way , following as it does a classic narrative structure in which there are a series of increasingly serious minor climaxes , then the climax , then the denouement . The overarching plan could have been provided by a computer if they'd had computers . This isn't necessarily a weakness . " Stagecoach " had a similar structure , and the platform itself has been around for a long time . Sophocles used it , didn't he ?
443078	819382	218839	7.0	Successful comedy about a dog show , sometimes very funny .	Diverse people travel to Philadelphia to show their dogs and vie for championship , and we tap into all the relationships . Let's see . There's the argumentative , spoiled Yuppie couple . The taciturn guy from the Southern bait shop . The affable trailer-trash couple from Fern City , Florida . The lesbian couple who show their manicured poodle , " White Rapsody . " The gay couple who are way out of the closet . It's well directed by Christopher Guest , has sometimes extremely amusing dialog and situations written by Guest and Eugene Levy , and is acted to perfection . It's done quietly though and hardly seems scripted at all , a kind of comedy verite in which performers sometimes speak directly to the camera while evidently being interviewed . There's a quiet , semi-documentary feel to the film . I can't go through the whole thing without spoiling some of the gags but I want - - no , I NEED - - to mention specifically some of the exchanges between the two commentators we see , probably speaking on the radio . Fred Willard and Jim Piddock play roles we're all familiar with from talk shows . Willard takes the part of the talk-show host , asking naive questions and making what he thinks are amusing comments , taking the role of the audience . Piddock , with a serious mien and Brit accent , is the expert who supplies precise knowledge and answers the host's dumb questions . The dogs are trotted out one by one to be examined . One of the dogs is hoisted onto a table and examined manually by the judge . Willard : " The judge here is Eddie Franklin . " Piddock : " I believe that's Edie Franklin , Buck . " Willard : " Oh , yeah . It's a woman alright . What's she doing now , Trevor ? " Piddock : " I believe she's examining the animal's testicular area . " Willard : " Oh , Wow ! I'd hate to go out on a date with Edie ! Can you imagine ? You're on a date with Edie and - - " Just one more . A judge picks up the dog's tail and examines it . Willard : " I'd hate to be handled like that , Trevor . I really hate it . You know , I once said to my proctologist , why don't you take me out to dinner sometime ? " Stop me , please . Piddock : " The judge was trained for the priesthood , I understand . Of course he didn't finish . Dropped out after one year . " Willard : " No KIDDING ? Boy , it would be interesting to find out what went wrong there . But I guess that's a whole nother show , eh ? " Some of it is more silly than funny . Eugene Levy has two left feet . But that's nothing compared to the many comic scenes that connect so squarely . It all ends happily in a couple of filmic postscripts . At the beginning we see the Yuppie couple complaining that their " child " is interfering with their sex lives , and the camera shows us their bored Weimerener . By the end , the couple tell their counselor that their sex lives are now terrific and the dog isn't a bother at all . " She likes to watch . " Meanwhile their second " child " , a bulldog , is humping the counselor's leg . You really ought to see this .
442392	819382	18773	7.0	A Chaplin Delight .	This feature stands alongside " The Gold Rush " and " Modern Times " as among Chaplin's best . If it lacks the exoticism and technological sophistication of the other two , it has some marvelously funny set pieces . Chaplin , as the Tramp , gets mixed up with a pickpocket while visiting the circus . Mistaken by the police for the criminal , he runs into the center of a clown act in the center ring and , without intending to , wows the audience in a way the clowns never did . His next escape attempt leads him into a magician's act in which he finds himself , to wild applause , frantically trying to stuff various small animals - - doves , ducks , piglets - - back into top hats on a table but finds himself swimming in the little beasts . There is a scene , lasting only a few minutes , in which Chaplin imitates a mechanical man that is about as funny as anything he's done . The inevitable sentiment is damped down . There is a circus girl that Chaplin falls for , but she is attracted to a newcomer , a debonair tightrope walker . It doesn't interfere with the comedy . There's no point in going on too long about the plot . It's mostly a series of set pieces . But the plots never meant too much in Chaplin's films from this period anyway . Recommended without qualification .
442478	819382	55728	7.0	Point of Order .	A pretty good , ensemble movie about political intrigues and the personal secrets and ideologies that propel them . Henry Fonda is the titular star but , really , there are half a dozen people who play important roles with , arguably , Don Murray's being the most dramatic and challenging . The plot . President Franchot Tone wants his nomination for Secretary of State , Fonda , to be confirmed by the Senate . There are senators who don't want to see Fonda get the job because he's too liberal or because of past feuds or both ( Charles Laughton ) . Others , like George Grizzard , are the most smegmaphagous of politicians who want to see Fonda get the job and are willing to stoop to blackmail to see him get it . The Chair of the Senate Subcomittee that is conducting the hearings , Don Murray , is a man of principle who plays by the rules and is holding off his judgment on Fonda . Fonda has a problem , see . At one time , mostly out of curiosity , he attended a few meetings of a communist cell in Chicago . Fonda's sworn enemy , Laughton , brings in an eye witness to Fonda's early mistakes , Burgess Meredith , but Fonda destroys him on the stand by proving that Meredith has made misstatements about his own past , including hiding the fact that he spent time in a psychiatric hospital . Burgess Meredith , with only a little screen time , gives the most nuanced performance . I don't want to get into the plot any farther because it's complicated and explication would take too much space and ruin too many surprises . And there ARE surprises . Here is one of them . This film was shot in 1961 during the Cold War , when the United States was bitterly divided on many issues . Yet the conflicts , in their essence , are still with us . Charles Laughton , not unreasonably , stands for firmness in dealing with the enemy . Let's stand up on our hind legs and fight back and not sacrifice our liberties or our dignity . We never have and we never will . Fonda , who is called an " egghead " in the film , is a former professor at the University of Illinois who sees nothing wrong with negotiations and compromise , depending on circumstances , and who feels that our diplomacy shouldn't be determined by pride . George Grizzard is a grimly vicious senator who plays all kinds of dirty pool and is willing to bring the temple down with him if he can't get his way . If some of that doesn't resonate , I don't know what will . Only the name of the enemy seems to have changed . Charles Laughton is as blubbery and crapulous as always but not nearly as animated as in earlier roles . He was dying of spinal cancer and it's a wonder he could walk at all . A long-ago homosexual experience plays an important part in the plot , leading to a suicide . Those attitudes , at least , have become more diverse . Sometimes politicians who are outed resign , sometimes they deny everything and continue with their careers , and sometimes they admit their gender orientation freely and continue in office , judged by their political values rather than what they do in the boudoir . Both Laughton and Grizzard might have had problems along those lines if they'd been involved in politics . And one wonders if the director , Otto Preminger , went out of his way to see well-known political activists cast as politicians - - Don Murray , Will Geer , Henry Fonda , Franchot Tone , Lew Ayres . Perhaps not . It's an interesting film with some good performances and , in the end , strikes me as a balanced piece of didactation rather than a propaganda piece .
442468	819382	25452	7.0	Knockabout Hitchcock Thriller .	Hitchcock and Truffaut almost had an argument over the relative value of this ( 1934 ) version of " The Man Who Knew Too Much " and the 1956 remake . Hitchcock , always averse to confrontation , finally admitted that the early film was the work of a talented amateur and the 1956 version that of a professional . For a " talented amateur , " this is pretty good stuff . It's true that the later version is glossier , more tense , and edgier , but this one is a lot of fun . We don't really worry for a moment that the kidnapped child ( Nova Pilbeam ) of Leslie Banks and Edna Best will be harmed . Nor can we readily imagine that the anonymous ambassador will be assassinated at the Albert Hall . Leslie Banks and his pal , who are trying to locate the place in London where the child is being held , don't seem to take the threat too seriously either . Where Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day played the pursuit almost entirely straight ( with the exception of one ludicrous scene in a taxidermist's shop ) , Banks and Buddy make wisecracks and engage in one comic adventure after another - - even a horrifying scene is the office of a sinister dentist who grins demoniacally as he intones , " That one had better come out . " ( Gulp . ) Edna Best as the anxious mother isn't around all that much . The place occupied by Doris Day in the remake is taken by Banks ' somewhat mentally stunted male buddy . You can get more laughs out of a male buddy than out of a fearful wife . You can bop the buddy over the head , hypnotize him , hit him with folding chairs , and pull his tooth . Try doing that to a near-hysterical Doris Day . Yes , the 1956 version is a more polished film , but it's a different kind of film too . This one is almost farcical and has Peter Lorre as a suavely sneaky murderer . It has a climactic shoot out that isn't particularly well done . But they're both identifiably Hitchcockian . Take your pick . You win either way .
443482	819382	36910	8.0	Propaganda - - good propaganda .	The poetry is sublime . A little touch of Harry in the night Once more , dear friends , once more unto the breach . The history sucks . Hitler used the same reasoning . Oh , please , don't make us invade your city and rape your women and smash your babies ' brains out against the wall . Please - - give up before you make us do this . Show us that you have destroyed your WMDs . Oops . How does Olivier , the director and principal , handle the production ? Pretty well . The movie's the thing , you know , and he does an extremely good job of managing it . Clearly he's watched a couple of Errol Flynn movies . He has lightly clad men armed only with knives dropping from the branches onto heavily armored French knights . ( Cf . , Robin Hood . ) He has a shot of a line of French knights and gaily flapping flags advancing towards the English at Agincourt , first at a walk , then a trot , then a gallop . ( Cf . , The Charge of the Light Brigade . ) But he has some unexpectedly original shots too - - a startling brief glimpse of a horse's bared teeth in the midst of battle . Harry was a marvelous young kid . Here he's a king and thrusts Falstaff aside . ( If you want to see Falstaff in excelsis you must see The Merry Wives of Windsor . ) Harry's claim to the throne of France is bull . In the play it takes up a lot of time , ratiocination by bishops who are trying to avoid taxes . Some gobblydegook about the Salic law entitling Henry to the throne of France , which had heretofore been either ignored or forgotten . It's all glossed over , here . The French are turned into outright villains - - foppish , insulting , comic ( a scene of a fully armored French knight being lowered jerkily onto his horse by means of a winch ) . Oh , they're sadists too . They raid Henry's supply camps and butcher the young boys they find there . But there's no denying the impact of the play . You'll get caught up in it . And , if you don't know what a Bohemian Henry V was , or how close he was to Sir John Falstaff , and if the movie " four score and five " English dead after Agincourt , an undercount if there ever was one , then what difference does it make ? Lawrence Olivier's performance can't go unmentioned though . It's just plain superb . He was a truly great actor , and there may never have been a Henry V ( or a Hamlet ) that was his equal . Here's the story . On a pretext , Henry V invades France and marries some high-class babe . England DID wind up ruling parts of northern France , as I remember , but not for long after Henry's departure .
442341	819382	32599	8.0	Hold That Tiger .	I think there are three versions of this play kicking around out there and this one is the best , not to mention the fastest . The director , Howard Hawks , was always good at light comedy , improvising gags on the spot and taking all sorts of liberties with the script . Sometimes the plot got lost along the way ( " The Big Sleep " ) but he was always a superb story teller . Hildy Johnson , Rosalind Russell , is an ace reporter about to marry a dull insurance salesman , Ralph Bellamy , but her editor wants to keep her on the paper . Cary Grant couldn't have been a better choice for the role of Walter Burns , Hildy Johnson's editor . He's handsome and roguish and lies with every breath he takes . Hawks rewrote the play . In the original , Hildy was a man but Hawks , who never quite got his gender roles straight , heard a talk-through and decided it would be more interesting if Hildy were a woman . And that enabled the writers to introduce the jealousy element , which wouldn't have fit the original story unless we're talking homoeroticism . I felt kind of sorry for Ralph Bellamy's character . Even his name - - Bruce Baldwin - - sounds like the noise a foot might make when it's being pulled from sludge . The poor guy is earnest , sincere , highly principled , and lives with his mother in Albany . He's the kind of man that every woman in the 1930s wanted to build a home with - - a beastly impulse in itself - - only they'd have to get rid of mother first . Ground glass in the Pablum perhaps . That mother is a real pain in the neck too . She's supposed to accompany them on the overnight train to Albany and travel with them on their honeymoon . Burns traps the feisty old lady into some contretemps and tells his goon , Louie , " Take her down to Polack Mike's and tell the cops she was plastered , " or something like that . Try putting a line like that into a politically correct movie today . Polack Mike's . Notwithstanding the fact that the Polish word for Polish people is " polaki . " The movie rises into the surreal once in a while . The assembled reporters , when they're not playing poker in the press room , speak in headlines . They call their editors with stories that can't possibly be printed . If additional guards will be placed around the scaffold during Earl Williams ' hanging , the lead is " Sheriff just adds new family members to city payroll . " Roger Ebert , a Chicago newsman himself , took some pleasure in seeing how much things had changed since the 1920s , but the change was to be expected . The eternal verities aren't very eternal when you get right down to it . When I was a kid , every car looked like it had been made in 1939 , the mass was said in Latin , and you could supposedly look up girls ' dresses by covertly glancing at their patent leather shoes . Now - - it's all changed . And where did it go ? ( Sob . ) Kleenex , please . Thank you . What an enjoyable and funny movie this is . Oh , it creaks at the joints , but that's to be expected because it's so old . It's like Cary Grant talking Ralph Bellamy into writing out Grant's insurance policy with Rosalind Russel as the beneficiary . Bellamy objects a bit because he wants to provide for her all by himself . But what if he can't ? " Can't you just imagine Hildy when you're gone ? Sitting on the porch swing ? Old lace and lavender ? " Bellamy says dreamily , " Yes , I can . " Grant stands back and snaps , " She's OOOOLD , isn't she ! " I can't stop laughing at the irreverence .
442661	819382	431197	8.0	Very Well-Done International Police Thriller .	There is an extremely violent attack within the protected area of Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , and many men , women , and children are killed , including some Americans . America has no jurisdiction but back-negotiations lead to a team of American agents led by the FBI's Jamie Foxx acquiring a five-day pass in Riyadh to help the Saudi police . There follows a kind of introduction to Islamic customs , which many Americans are badly in need of . When you shake hands with a Saudi nobleman , you don't let go of his hand until he does . ( Videoclips of President Bush holding hands with a Saudi royal were played repeatedly on television , often accompanied by sarcastic comments , but this was at least one occasion on which Bush had been properly briefed and the press not . ) These Arabs object to dirty words like bull , and the colonel shouts at an American that his mother should have washed out his mouth . An infidel is not allowed to touch a Moslem's body , and so forth . Of course Islam , like all world religions , has multitudinous " little traditions " in which different rules apply , but this is the official Saudi version . Well , let us not get into cultural anthropology . The four members of the team ( including Jennifer Garner , Jason Bateman , and the ever-reliable Chris Cooper ) are met by the Saudi Police Colonel ( Ashrof Barhom ) whose strictly defined job is to herd them around the site of the blast and keep them from getting themselves hurt . The colonel offers his help reluctantly and keeps within the rules but gradually he and the team members warm to one another and eliminate the criminals behind the blast , but only at terrible cost . This is a mature movie and in many ways exceedingly well done . It isn't AT ALL like " Not Without My Children . " The Moslems are different from us , but not all of them are enemies , unless you sloppily define everyone who is different from us as an enemy . And the Americans are not morally pure or arrogant . As Foxx tells the colonel , " America isn't perfect . I'm the first to admit it . But this is something we are very very good at . " And the team IS good at it , better than the Saudi police , which is believable enough . I mean , these Americans are the cream of the crop , the best we have to offer . I don't know what would happen if you threw Lieutenant Columbo into Riyadh but these four people know what they're doing . I enjoyed the story because it seems , in some sense a little hard to define , realistic . The script gives the performers believable little exchanges and the actors live up to the demands . The photography is fine as well . And the plot is a real thriller . It could have gone completely awry , with heroes killing villains by the gross , but it sticks to its guns and refuses to pander to the adolescent in us . When the high muck-a-mucks are finally tracked down and most of them killed , they aren't a garden-variety gang of ugly , sneering thugs . They are a family with a couple of attached violence-prone friends . The leader is a man so old he can't rise out of bed , yet he can slowly slide an automatic weapon out from under his mattress . He dies with his grandchild sobbing on his riddled chest . Another family member is a gawky adolescent who shoots the colonel in the back and is in turn disarticulated by the team's bullets . The team survives all sorts of tribulations but not with superhuman heroics , just a certain amount of skill and a lot of luck , and they lose a good friend in the bargain . It ends realistically , not hopefully . In the apartment of the head honcho , with gory bodies strewn about the floor , the women and children squeeze themselves into corners and weep as the smoke clears . Jennifer Garner offers a lollipop to the tiny girl to quiet her down . She accepts the candy when her mother allows her to , and in return she meekly hands a gift to Garner . The little girl's hand opens and on its palm rests a large marble - - the stuff that has been encased in the explosive charge . The movie isn't perfect . It was directed by the actor Peter Berg and it is to him that we owe " the wobbling camera " problem . The camera wobbles . It wobbles almost constantly , though not as bad as in , say , " The Bourne Ultimatum . " Sometimes the camera hides behind an object that obscures half our view , but it still wobbles . It doesn't HAVE to wobble to be exciting . I mean , take a look at the equally tense and violent shoot-out at the end of " Heat . " No wobbles . I blame this insane and irritating fad on two things : ( 1 ) A generation of kids who grew up on video games in which everything is motion under a time constraint , and ( 2 ) the MBAs who green light projects like this and firmly believe that the camera must be constantly moving and the editing lightning fast or those kids who grew up on video games will be bored . The technique , though , doesn't match the content here . A childish trick applied to adult material . Or maybe I'm turning into an old curmudgeon . It happens . Why , just yesterday my spectacles fell off into my guacamole .
442488	819382	52520	8.0	What's Not to Like ?	Rod Serling was quite a guy , a nice Jewish kid from Binghamton , NY , who volunteered for the paratroopers in WWII , was wounded , and attended Antioch College in Yellowsprings , Ohio , on the GI Bill . He worked his way up through TV , and sometimes feature films , as a writer and finally got his own series , " The Twilight Zone . " He was exceedingly generous , a Franciscan fool , who publicly threw open the doors to all writers of all stripes while organizing the series . No filters . Anybody could submit a script . But he had to knock that off and resort to the usual means of getting decent stories because the ones flowing in tended to be written in long hand , sometimes on legal pads , and frequently by maniacs . The original team of writers , producers , and directors - - beginning with the first season and lasting two or three years - - was the best . Each member of the cast and crew knew pretty much exactly what they were doing . Buck Houghton , as producer , held the enterprise together and Serling wrote many of the scripts himself . The quality began falling off after a few years . The stories became less original and a bit repetitious . One of the reasons was that Buck Houghton was lured away by a better job . Another was that Serling was simply getting burned out , as he himself admitted . The stories seemed to fall into several categories : the comic stories of special properties in ordinary things or ordinary people ( eg . , " Mr . Dingle The Strong " ) , futuristic science fiction ( eg . , " To Serve Man " ) , moral lessons consisting mainly of dialog ( eg . , " The Obsolete Man " ) , and some sort of time travel ( eg . , " Back There " ) . There was often a good deal of overlap . " Next Stop Willoughby " combines a moral lesson with time travel . I've always found the moral tales least successful because the series , ambitious though it might occasionally be , was so determinedly middlebrow . We don't really learn much if an episode tells us that the concentration camps were evil or that an excess of conformity can be dangerous . The comic episodes could be beguiling . And the time travel episodes were often wistful and nostalgic . Serling never forgot his youth on the streets of an ordinary town that , in retrospect , before he became a hot property himself , must have seemed like paradise . His organization and scripts are sprinkled with self-referential names - - Cayuga Productions ( one of the Finger Lakes in New York state ) , a bus to Cortland ( a small town near Ithaca ) , the old train stopping at the non-existent town of Willoughby ( in Ohio , near Yellowsprings ) . Serling himself introduced the episodes and gave the final speech . He refused to appear on screen the first year because he felt his appearance was unprepossessing - - short , not particularly handsome . He couldn't have been more wrong , of course , because he had a distinctive presence on screen , at least the equal of Alfred Hitchcock's . Serling died in his early 50s during heart surgery , a shame . He may have been past his prime , but how nice it would be if all of us could claim such a prime .
442602	819382	78111	8.0	Most Friendship is Feigning , Most Loving Mere Folly .	There are a couple of reasons to see this well-executed movie . One is Brooke Shields in her only believable performance , as a defiant self-absorbed brat who learns not just about sex but about love . She is , of course , dazzlingly beautiful and barely pubescent and it's necessary to get beyond that . Value judgments about whether she should or should not have made this movie aren't really relevant . The movie is too good for that . Throwing up our hands and rolling our eyes is a little like interpreting " Lolita " as a simple story about pedophilia . Looked at pragmatically , Shields ' playing this role hurt no one . Certainly it didn't hurt her subsequent career , what there was of it . There isn't any way to stop our own feelings of disgust at times , granted . I feel that way about movies like Friday the 13th or Halloween . I'm more disgusted by murder than by sex so I'm clearly warped . Shields packs more talent into her playing here , as Violet , than she did into all of her other movies put together . And it's not a one-note performance either . She develops from a vulgar know-it-all into a creature of real emotion . At the end of the story , her mother is taking her away from the older man she has married . The camera slowly moves in on her trembling face . She's silent but the froufraws in her hair quiver with regret . Malle ends it on a freeze frame of that drop-dead gorgeous , wrenchingly sad face . Malle is another reason this movie is worth while . He was a great story teller , even when the stories were a bit thin , as Polly Platt's is here . His specialite de la maison was the study of a community . He was almost anthropological in his approach . If he doesn't give us the social structure and eidos of a French boarding school , then it's Atlantic City , or a New Orleans whorehouse in 1917 . We get to know the milieu pretty well , although we don't see much of the actual city , only the house itself , its back yard paved with coquina crunching under everyone's shoes , the palms and banana plants , the anoles . We get to know the furniture inside the house - - massive heavy things , overstuffed , overdone , overlaced , rose windowed . New Orleans was an odd city , a blend of all sorts of ethnic traditions . There's a bit of hoodoo thrown into the plot . ( Madame Livingston addresses her clients as " M'sieur . " ) Edgar Degas visited relatives in New Orleans . Now , alas , it's becoming not much more than another big Southern city with the Quarter serving as a kind of theme park . Note too Malle's editing technique . When you expect a shot to disappear , to dissolve or be cut away from , it doesn't always happen . The image lingers , sometimes long beyond our expectations . Keith Carradine balked when Shields is taken away from him , for instance . Much of this beauty ( let's call a heart a heart ) is made possible by the superb photography of Ingmar Bergman's collaborator , Sven Nyquist . He makes it possible for us to almost feel the heat and the humidity , and the solid mahogany of the bar . The depiction of the cat house is convincingly realistic , the general atmosphere being one of casual jealousy , petulance , nudity , practicality , and mutual support . The women ( and the clients ) form fleeting friendships . When they leave , it's without any particular ceremony . That's why the love that develops between Carradine and Shields is as shocking as it is . It's the only real commitment shown in the film . There is an abundance of commitment on the part of the people who contributed to this very good film .
442367	819382	107007	8.0	Defines Epic .	Who's going to want to watch a movie about the American Civil War ? Oh , sure , maybe the public will watch an ageless soap opera like " Gone With the Wind " but a movie about nothing but a BATTLE ? No women in it ? No slashers ? No aliens or car chases or huge explosions or sex ? Americans have no interest in their own history . In a way , it's not too bad to have moguls in charge of things instead of a committee of MBAs whose eyes dart first to the bottom line . It USED to be this way in the movies when there was still a studio system and the Louis B . Mayers and Sam Goldwyns and Harry Cohns could manage ( or mismanage ) their empires as they liked . It used to be that way in publishing too . Mr . Simon and Mr . Schuster and Mr . Knopf and Mr . Scribner could print whatever they liked , even if they thought it would turn out to be a quality loser instead of an immensely profitable but brainless blockbuster . That's all pretty much changed now , and a lot of people would argue not for the better . So you have to give Ted Turner a lot of credit for financing this expensive production . As Ronald F . Maxwell , the director , put it - - " He followed his passion . " ( Cf . , Joseph Campbell , " Follow your bliss . " ) You have to give the reenactors credit for following their passions too . I doubt that they were paid although I expect they were fed . For what it's worth , the staging of the scene in which Lt . Chamberlain chats with three Confederate prisoners is copied directly from a Winslow Homer painting . It's an excellent movie , blending character study with action . Of the performances , I thought were Sheen as Lee , Lang as Pickett , Jordan as Armistad , and Mallon , who played Winfield Scott Hancock . Not that the other performances were poor . They're all up to professional snuff but , well , for instance , how much could Jeff Daniels do with a character who is a taciturn and inexpressive New Englander beyond speaking his lines woodenly ? I should also mention Lancaster as the British observer . He's pretty good . He comes across at first as simpering and dressed like a bellboy in a fancy French hotel , but when the situation calls for it his head tilts back and his eyes narrow searchingly . He does a splendid job of being just friendly enough to absorb information without expressing any opinions about the events he witnesses . It's a small part but nicely done . Stephen Lang's General Pickett is a descendant of the cavaliers who settled the South , gentlemanly , proud , brave , and filled with a kind of Errol Flynn factor . Sheen's Lee is thoughtful , religious , and wrong in his decisions . Jeb Stuart has a small part , as he did in the battle itself . He was given to riding in complete circles around the opposing Federal army and he did it at Gettysburg too , but that wasn't his job . I won't go on about the story of the battle itself because , if the MBAs are correct in their assumptions about you , any further discussion of the battle would be a spoiler for you . So - - no hints about who won . ( Ps : There is no Confederate States of America anymore . ) What a bloody and stupid war that was . Well , they all are of course , but some are unavoidable while others seem even more irrational than most . And the emotions generated by that conflict seem to persist beyond any real reason . It wasn't that long ago that roadside stands in the South displayed beach towels picturing a tattered Confederate soldier carrying the battle flag over his shoulder , and the caption , " Hell no , we won't forget . " Why not ? Nobody who fought that war is still alive . It's the sort of sentiment that will lead to the next war and the one after that .
442388	819382	120824	8.0	New Wind Sweeps Clean	SPOILERS . It doesn't start out promising . As in " American Beauty , " we hear Kevin Spacey's exhausted voice-over telling us how he was physically mishandled by his father and how empty his life is now . A brief marriage to a half-mad Kate Blanchett results in a child , Bunny , but it doesn't seem to help Spacey . At his father's funeral he runs into an aunt from a Canadian maritime province and , having no particular reason for existence in upstate New York , travels home with her . That's when the story proper begins to get a bit more lively . This is a barren windswept place , tucked so far up into the northern latitudes that even at noon objects leave long shadows on the salt grass . People fish in this small village . They eat " seal flipper pies " made of the more cartilaginous parts of the fin . People speak with a kind of mid-Atlantic accent and they have queer names like Card and Buggitt and Quoyle . But it's livelier than it sounds underneath those lowering skies . Spacey gets a job at the local newspaper , The Gammy Bird or something like that . Well , okay , it's not the New York Times , but even the Pt . Reyes Lighthouse won a Pulitzer a few years ago . His assignment : write the shipping news , detailing which ships enter and leave port , and throw in any relevant bits of information . Also cover the regular car wrecks . Spacey runs into the couple who have just brought a yacht into harbor , a yacht that was built for Adolph Hitler , and does a story on it , much to the pleasure of the editor ( Scott Glenn ) who spends most of his time fishing . His career as journalist progresses , punctuated by the headlines he gradually learns to compose . An older colleague takes him to the shore , tells him to look at the horizon , and describe what he sees . " There are some mountains - - and a lot of dark clouds , " ventures Spacey . " Nope : IMMINENT STORM THREATENS VILLAGE , " says his mentor . " But what if it doesn't come ? " Spacey asks . Answer : " DANGEROUS STORM SPARES VILLAGE . " There's a lot of humor in this film actually but none of it is played for laughs . It's the kind of humor that grows out of everyday encounters , unremarked upon but palpably there . Much of it is provided by the headlines . After some social coup , Spacey smiles with satisfaction and muses , " CLUMSY MAN STUNS CROWD . " ( It's a little like the " Windbag " chapter in " Ulysses . " ) Spacey also runs into Julianne Moore , than whom there is no less glamorous or more talented actress on screen these days , who has a retarded child and a punk history of her own . The romance moves slowly and tentatively along as it might in life outside of the movies . The couple do not throw themselves into bed on their first night together and dissolve in an ecstasy of sighs and moans . But it's basically the story of Spacey's self discovery . Nothing as simple as , " EMPTY MAN GOES HOME AND FINDS HIS ROOTS . " Not a bit of it . His family has a lunatic and criminal history on these islands and the secrets are uncovered bit by bit , a patchwork of incest , rape , torture , piracy , and murder , all symbolized by a dreary haunted-looking old house anchored to the stone shore by steel cables and turnbuckles to hold it against the storms . Well , a storm finally does lash the village . I was in such a storm , a hurricane in fact , in a small seaside village outside of Pago Pago in American Samoa . After a day and a night of savagery the dawn came and I was amazed after I'd crawled out from what was left of the place into the crisp new air - - trees down , bushes blasted away , huts shredded , and a majestic vista now that so many obstructions had been flattened . Something like that happens here . The final headline : " STORM DESTROYS HOUSE . LEAVES EXCELLENT VIEW . " I can't NOT mention Kevin Spacey's performance . He's so wispy and insensate at the beginning that he barely exists . He's heavier than usual here and walks in a fitting fashion . Now this is much tougher than what Russell Crowe did with his shambling in " A Beautiful Mind , " or Dustin Hoffman's tics in " Rain Man , " because Spacey has not to EMBODY a mental illness but to suggest a spiritual one . His performance is as close to perfection as it's possible to imagine , although by definition it must lack bravura . Moore is first rate , as usual , her flattish face almost luminous with sensibility , and the smaller parts are just fine . So is the direction . Spacey has , by my count , three nightmares about his childhood and not once does he wake up and thrust his face into the camera and scream . The score is understated during the film but rackets along behind the credits percussively in something like time . See this if you can , really , for an acting lesson if for no other reason , as long as you don't expect to find a slasher crawling through a fish factory with a chef's knife .
442940	819382	145044	8.0	First , do the patient no harm ?	Dr . William Palmer ( Keith Allen ) seems to have forgotten the first principle of the Hippocratic oath . He goes about nonchalantly poisoning people who inconvenience him financially or emotionally . It's not clear exactly how many people he managed to put away , but he can certainly lay claim to the title of England's first celebrity serial killer . This is one of those long , leisurely British TV productions with a lot of elegance and good production values , the kind the Brits do so well ( Inspector Morse , Sherlock Holmes ) . The characters might be described as late Dickensian . Dr . Palmer's mother is decked out in a wardrobe that makes her look like that portrait of W . C . Fields imitating Queen Victioria . But as far as that goes , all of the period detail seems accurate . You would not really want to be treated by one of the doctors of this period . ( Although Palmer was a surgeon , not a medical doctor , and they had less status . " Surgeon " comes from the same root as " chiropractor " and their practice was initially limited to sawing and cutting . ) If the patient is ill , the doctor of the period gives him a quick exam then recommends things like " tincture of mercury " , or " a few drops of nitric acid " , or chamomile tea , or " the black draft . " No , not THAT kind of black draft . Germs hadn't been discovered yet and the doctor might come directly from fertilizing his garden to fomenting the cut on your hand . Between the opium and the belladonna half the people in Europe must have had their pupils pinned at f . 11 . In any case , Dr . Palmer is played in a kind of Dennis Price style . He oozes superciliousness . His expression constantly hovers somewhere between boredom and amusement . And when he's really vexed he looks exasperated . The character , evil as he is , with the help of the director and editor , provides a constant source of ironic humor , a Richard III in a stovepipe hat . The movie depends on him and he makes it work . It's Allen's performance that keeps this from being just another true-crime horror film . I mentioned the contributions of the director and the editor because they add a good deal to the ease with which we can keep our distance from the goings on . When someone remarks to Dr . Palmer that one of his creditors would be better off dead , and Palmer looks wryly up towards the camera and muses , " Yes , I suppose so , " and the editor cuts away immediately , you might feel a repulsive shock but you'll probably feel a mean amusement too . The other performers are excellent as well . Freddy Jones is ( for him ) pretty subdued as an older doctor in Rugely who has a lifetime of experience but no formal credentials . Some of the characters around Palmer are innocents who die . Others are innocents who wise up to what's going on . Some of them die too , while others live to see Palmer swing . The film isn't hard hearted . Maybe one or two of the victims are gin-soaked viragos , but others are perfectly friendly , generous people and we don't enjoy seeing them go . Palmer was a nasty guy who pretty much earned what he got . Try to see it if you have a chance . It's not around that much .
441988	819382	39661	8.0	Above Average Drama	The story of a young man ( Power ) who is a barker at a carnival in the Midwest . He's cuckolding this old drunk , accidentally kills him , and then coaxes " the code " out of the dead man's wife ( Blondell ) . The two-person code is a secret way of pronouncing words that enables a blindfolded " psychic " to read and answer questions that his partner picks up from the audience . The act is a real moneymaker and soon enough Power deserts the carnival and takes off with a pretty young woman ( Gray ) for the Big Time in Chicago , playing night clubs . The money rolls in but Power wants more . He falls in with a shrink ( Walker ) who has a closet full of secrets from her clients . With access to these he bamboozles a rich guy into handing over $150K . Power even gets Gray to pose as the man's long dead love , but Gray breaks down when she sees the " chump " fall to his knees and start to pray , and she blows the con . She and Power barely make it out of town ahead of the police . He sends her back to the carnival and begins hitting the bottle . Some time later he shows up at a carnival , a physical and mental shambles , and is given the lowest job available , a " geek " - - somebody who eats live chickens in return for a bottle a day and a place to sleep it off . He's a broken man but finally comes around when he accidentally joins a carnival that Gray is performing in . End of story . This is well above average . Much of the credit must go to Tyrone Power in what has to be his best dramatic performance . He's always been good at projecting self confidence , and he does it here , but the script also demands that he turn into an alcoholic wreck and he's equally convincing . The other performances are quite good too , including Joan Blondell as a tough but nurturant floozy , and Colleen Gray , the profile of whose nose speaks for itself . She doesn't HAVE to be particularly good . All she has to do is stand there and you can't take your eyes from that baby-doll face . Jules Furthman's script helps a lot in unobtrusive ways . In most movies of this type , the characters speak as if they had all graduated from Oberlin . Here they sound like real , working-class stiffs of the 30s and 40s - - dropping their " g " s and sayin ' " ain't . " The odd double negative don't mean nothing ' to them . There isn't too much of this louche touch , just enough for it to slip past our apperceptive apparatus without calling attention to itself . Ben Nye did the makeup . He ought to get a medal for what he does to Tyrone Power's eyes at the end . Power doesn't look grotesque or in any way overdone , but it's as if Dorian Gray's portrait had suddenly been revealed to us halfway through Wilde's tale . His eyes are just short of a gargoyle's . He looks the way we all sometimes feel in the morning . Withall , I must say that some of the strength of Power's performance comes from corny overacting . He has two modalities in his presentation of self . One is his usual good-natured self-interested wise-guy cynic . The other is a saintly kind of smiling sing-song he employs while trying to con someone . Now , we in the audience know which is which because we've been clued in by what we've learned . But there are times when he uses his con-man persona on people who should know better , including his wife ! Colleen Gray too is liable to lapse into emotional outbursts that don't give us the feeling that there's much behind them except energy . These are the kinds of wrinkles it's the director's job to smooth over and he was nodding at the time . The photography by Lee Garmes is impressive . Great use of shadows and key lights . In fact the whole movie is pretty good . If only Power had stuck to his phony mentalist act and not dragged God kicking and screaming onto the stage . That's known as " hubris " and you know what happens when you pull THAT kind of stunt . For me , the most telling scene appears near the end , when Power has become a dipsomaniacal hobo . He and a handful of other bums are huddled under a railroad trestle . Power is holding a bottle of whiskey and begins to demonstrate the carny trick called a " cold reading , " using the bottle as a prop . Then he shrugs and makes some rueful comment . While he stares silently , the others take his bottle and pass it around . He shakes off his rumination , looks around with fright , and cries , " Hey , where's my bottle ? There won't be enough left for me ! " A vagrant replies , " Buddy , you're a real mind reader , " and drains it . Power yanks the empty bottle from his hand , goggles at it , and then sucks from it desperately . When he looks around , the others are gone and a train is rattling like a calamity over his head . Potent stuff .
441977	819382	78788	8.0	The heads - - you're lookin ' at the heads . . . .	What a movie . Martin Sheen is an anguished Army captain in Vietnam in 1968 , ordered to proceed up river to the Cambodian border on a Navy River Patrol Boat and assassinate a Colonel Kurtz ( Marlon Brando ) who has apparently gone berserk and established his own little , ruthless anti-communist empire in the jungle . It's a free transposition of Joseph Conrad's " Heart of Darkness " but that hardly matters . Nor does the overall plot . We already know most of it because some of its features have become integral to our vernacular culture . " I love the smell of napalm in the morning . It smells like - - victory . " " The horror . The horror . " ( Well - - that last is lifted directly from Conrad's novel , but never mind . ) What Stephen Spielberg did so miraculously with light in " Close Encounters of the Third Kind , " Francis Ford Coppola does with smoke here . All kinds of smoke . Gray smoke from gunfire and explosions . Amber smoke from fires . Pink and lime and lavender smoke from flares and grenades . People stalk slowly through it like images from hell . Boats drift through clouds of it . The lighting ( Vittorio Storaro ) and special effects contribute to the impact of the film too . Brando's first appearance in unforgettable chiaroscuro . A burnt orange light illuminates his shaved head from the side and turns the naked scalp into a luminous crescent . Then Brando bows his head , dips his fingers into a bowl of water and flutters his fingertips along the skin as if playing a piano or celesta . Sheen's boat and its two-man crew glide very slowly into the tiny cove which serves as Brando's main port . The place looks like mannequin factory . There are bodies and body parts strewn about . Bodies that are more or less whole droop from the trees and from the gargoyle monuments that surround the entrance to Brando's dark and beckoning castle . Hundreds of half-naked natives with spears and guns have assembled in silence to greet the boat . Out of this unholy horde dances a crazed photographic journalist , the ever reliably crazed Dennis Hopper . He shouts greetings , shakes hands , welcomes them warmly , but adds in a wary tone , " They think you've come to kill him - - and I hope THAT'S not true . " He leads the stunned Sheen through the throng that opens before them . Sheen is gaping at some of the body parts . " The heads - - you're lookin ' at the heads ! Y'know , sometimes he goes too far , but he'll be the first to admit it , man . " Brando is a warrior and a poet . He's a philosopher . " Did you ever think that the middle word of LIFE is IF ? " That whole climactic visit to Brando's fortress in the wilderness lifts the movie out of whatever sense of reality it had earlier carried and places it squarely into the surreal . It's just impossible . A viewer can't tell what consequences any given event will precipitate . There are two beheadings and a buffalo having its head half chopped off by the Bontoc Igorots among whom this film was shot . ( Only three generations ago , they hunted heads . I was in graduate school with an Igorot whose grandfather had enjoyed such an enterprise . ) It's about as arty a film as you're likely to see , if art means slowly and relentlessly digging beneath the civilized surface of human culture and uncovering the uncoverable nature of humanity itself , and that's not a pretty picture .
442620	819382	230169	8.0	Deranged	Considered as a film about an unhappy and perverted man , the movie is so-so , perhaps a bit more . A boy and his brother grow up on a dismal farm . Their father is brutal , their mother religious and caring but stern too . Always , when they show weakness , there is the shadow of the allegation of femininity hanging in the background . Older boy leaves home as soon as decorum allows . The father disappears from their lives and the mother , domineering and clinging , takes over Ed Gein's life . She dies painfully . Ed goes mad . Mother appears in hallucinations , telling Ed what to do , scolding him if he hesitates , prompting him to acts most of us might vomit at the mere thought of . But you know what ? This is way , way ahead of the usual sorts of slasher movies , the kind that have turned into self parodies . Railsback was executive producer and cast himself in the principal role , and he's good too , although his mangled Southern mumble is a bit difficult to square with the actual Wisconsin setting of the events . Railsback underplays Gein's psychosis just enough . Gein isn't a loony loner , as he might have been . He's a slow-moving gloomy looking guy who dresses like a sloppy rube ( you can almost smell his unwashed overalls ) but he's reasonable in public , seems to have his wits about him . He makes the right kinds of comments , more or less , at the times they are called for . Overhearing a conversation between a saleswoman and a customer who has heart disease , he wishes her well on her forthcoming operation , a nice gesture that anyone with claims to normality might make . Railsback makes him quiet , slightly awkward , and gives him a constant shy smile in front of others . It's a fine portrayal of schizophrenia , better than Russel Crowe's in " A Beautiful Mind . " Gein is just about perfect , a shambling walk ( almost on tip toe ) , a stare that lasts far too long , the unfunny joke he tells that makes him laugh out loud while others gawk , the half-baked religious ideas , a daily cycle that seems all non sequitur . He gets the necessary chores done , buys antifreeze and goes shopping . Not the way you and I might - - he lives on nothing but canned pork and beans ( and some other things ) - - but he gets the job done . He hangs out from time to time in a depressingly dark rural saloon , where he sits one or two stools away from the few other customers . The others know him , and some , like the bartender , are kind and sympathetic to him , while some make jokes about him . That's his public face . Rather a dull lonely man , a sad man really who has never recovered from his mother's death , someone who needs looking after and will never get it . His home , however - - well , that's a different matter entirely . As a police officer once said about Son of Sam's residence , " the inside of his house looks like the inside of his head . " It's a remote and non-productive place , falling apart on the outside , the lock missing from the front door , old tires and bedsprings in the yard . That's just the outside . The inside is even worse . Horrible , in fact . About the single most depressing dump I can remember seeing on screen in recent years . Little light seems to enter . And what the light shows us we'd rather not see . The man seems never to have thrown out any piece of junk he's come into possession of . Old newspapers stacked in corners . Dirty dishes . An unmade bed that any prison could improve upon . Gein was frankly nuts , no question about it . But , as I understand it , he murdered only two people , both of them middle-aged ladies who treated him in a motherly fashion . Of course the house had body parts all over it but these were from dug-up corpses . The man ate out of bowls made from that part of the skull called the calvarium , and so did his few guests . But naturally he had few guests . He made a few dollars babysitting two boys at his place but when one of them wandered into his bedroom - - the bedroom with the shrunken heads on the walls and the rats on the floor - - he ushered the kids to the door and politely and firmly told them not to come back . " I guess a man needs his privacy , " he tells them . The two murders are horrifying in a non-sensational way . Both women are shot without expecting it to happen . One doesn't die immediately and protests when her punctured body is dragged out to Gein's truck to be taken to his cellar and dressed like a hog . But , although the scenes are graphic and realistic , they are not at all sensationalized . No preliminary threats , no bondage or torture , no screaming , no maniacal whacking with axes or bashing in of heads with maces . It's all the more frightening for its matter-of-fact tone . And there is one scene in which Gein , a raving lunatic , dances out of his front door into the moonlight , dressed in long johns and human skin , a merkin fixed to his groin , banging pots and pans and whooping with God only knows what rotten pot of exaltations . It's far more shocking than anything in " Henry : Portrait of a Serial Killer , " although the two have the senselessness of random murders in common . You want to be scared ? This true story , this production , ought to do the job . You'll be locking your doors at night .
442015	819382	74806	8.0	Little , yes , but clever too .	I'm about to spill most of the beans here so if you don't want to know what happens , read no farther . Jody Foster is Rynn , the little girl who lives down the lane in a spotless , New England cottage , with her reclusive poet father . Or so it seems . When a nosy landlady , Alexis Smith , looking mighty good , shows up and begins making pointed inquiries about dear old Dad , Foster allows a heavy trap door to bonk her on the head and put a permanent end to her queries . The body remains in the cellar , aging along with the wine and Foster's mother . There is , of course , no father upstairs sleeping , or working behind his locked bedroom door , or off somewhere tending to some affair . After home schooling his keen-minded little girl , he advises her never to allow others to dictate her decisions . Thereafter , he wades off into the surf , leaving behind a payment of three years ' rent on the house and a sizable sum of cash for his daughter to dip into . But Jody Foster is too clever by half . She's got the brains and the cultivation of an adult . ( We can tell because she loves Chopin and knows how to preserve dead bodies after poisoning them ) . But she has an emotional configuration that befits her shapely thirteen-year-old body . I mean , what the hell is she going to do when the rent is up , when the cash runs out ? A little more substance in the frontal lobe wouldn't hurt . Martin Sheen , as Alexis Smith's son , could , I suppose , be categorized as the bad guy . He's had a slight run-in with the law over an encounter with a pre-teen earlier , and now we see him torture Foster's gerbil with a lighted cigarette and then fling the tiny beast into the fireplace . He hits on Foster , and he says to the teen-aged boy whom Foster has befriended and confided in , Scott Jacoby as Mario Miglioriti , " Hit the road , Wop . " Sheen discovers Foster's secret but the audience is likely to feel little sorrow at his passing as he finishes the cup of tea she's prepared for him and comments , " Tastes like almonds . " I hope nobody gets this movie mixed up with a schlock fest like " The Last House on the Left . " No blood here . No screams . Just the rather slow unfolding of a tense story with , I have to say , a flimsy premise . You can't get very far with a story of a young girl who wants to be left alone and murders people who ask too many questions . How many bodies can that wine cellar hold ? There are some weaknesses in the script too . Her dear mother's body has been lying in the cellar for a month or so and when Mario asks about decomposition , Foster says , " You can put stuff on them . I read about it in the library . " Well , the thing about preserving bodies has to do with putting something IN them , not just ON them . You don't have to be a mortician to know that . Any good taxidermist will fill you in . The performances , on the other hand , are all good . ( They pretty much have to be . Almost everything takes place in one room . ) A lot of the film's weight rests on the shoulders of Jody Foster . How is she ? She's amazing . She was fourteen when this was shot ( the same age as Lolita ) and she never puts a foot wrong . Every line is believable . On top of that , she only be in her teens , but she's criminally beautifully , and sexy too , enough to bring out the pedophile in any normal man . She's the kind of adolescent you'd like to dandle on your knee and subtly caress while discussing Nietsche with her . Sorry , but that surely must have been something the film makers realized . Her ash blond hair is long and wavy and she wears bangs low across her forehead , turning her eyes a deeper blue . Her features are slightly fuller than they were to become , and she has a gap between her upper incisors that produces a slight whistle when she utters sibilants . She's endearing , brain and body both . Some kids seem to be born with the talent to lie well , as an actress and as a character . Foster's got it
443548	819382	166924	9.0	" No hay sentido común ? "	So many people seem puzzled by this film but I don't know why . The interpretation is clear enough . You see , the thing is , the apartment manager Coco ( Miller ) is simply dreaming that she is Betty ( Watts ) who is in turn dreaming that she is Rita ( Harring ) . Near the beginning of the film , when the amnesic Rita lies down in the dark and goes to sleep , she dreams that she is the director's mother ( Miller ) and - - AT THE SAME TIME - - out of penis envy she also takes the role of the director ( Theroux ) so that she can have sex with the person she loves most in the world - - herself . ( You don't really think that masturbation scene is in there just for the fun of it , do you ? ) The heuristic skeleton key rests on one simple and indisputable fact . The two dreams - - Miller's and Rita's - - interact with one another . For the simple minded this might prove a problem , but I'm sure Jung would have had no problem with it . Of course Jung was a madman , but still - - Well , I won't go on with this because I don't want to spoil anyone's pleasure by spelling everything out . Let me just say that the topper is this : I MYSELF dreamed this entire movie last night after a dish of chili to which , I admit , a few too many habanero peppers might have been added . Does that explain it for you ? Or do I need to draw you a picture . Actually , all seriousness aside , we can at least guess at the meaning . My guess would be that Betty ( or Diane ) came to LA , fell for a leading actress who managed to get her small parts , and got jealous when the actress fell for the director . So she hired someone to knock off the actress but somehow the deal was made public and when the cops came for her she shot herself . That's my guess . Honest . Whatever else one can say about the movie , this is a true original . Nobody but David Lynch would have dared to make it . It is two and a half hours of absolutely gripping and unfathomable meandering . An exercise in style that probably won't appeal to everyone , but a work of committed art nonetheless . ( Who understands Finnegans Wake , another dream ? ) What Quentin Tarrantino did to chronology in " Pulp Fiction , " Lynch does here , only some of the out-of-synch sequences are fantasies . Each of the dozen or so semi-episodes is related to the others in some way and each scene is intact and comprehensible unto itself but , related or not , the scenes don't quite match one another logically . ( Eg . , before the credits we see a frenetic bunch of jitterbuggers which has nothing to do with the story until the end , when we learn that Watts got into performing after winning a jitterbug contest in Ontario . ) Like a poem in sprung rhythm each line fits perfectly but is discordant . Naomi Watts . How come Australia has been fielding all these succulent blonds ? Where do they get them from ? She is perfect for the part . When she arrives in L . A . she is breathless with excitement . She has this gracile frame and wide gray eyes and two big childlike incisors and is given to phrases like , " I couldn't afford this place in a million years . " And , " Everything is A-Okay . " And " Wow ! " She seems so pale and vulnerable and naive that one senses she could be easily squished . She's perfectly believable as Nancy Drew and later , when she is the bitter , discarded lover , she's STILL believable in a darker , spiteful way . I just saw it for the second time , expecting to be bored , but couldn't get away from the screen . Every scene had something new and ominous in it . A singer in the club Silencio , belting out a song in Spanish and a cappella that I didn't recognize as " Cryin ' " until it was almost over . I wondered if Ray Orbison in plus time and minus space could recognize it . The trumpeter was Conti Condoli , a fantastic jazz musician ( for a white guy ) who has played with Stan Kenton and Doc Severison and has his own recognizable style . No hay mejor ! His brother Pete's pretty good too . The sound department also deserves plaudits for meeting the considerable demands placed on it by the film . The score will make your woofer tremble . There's a little humor in it , not much . Dog doody on the tiles . Two scenes involving Theroux's wife . Okay , I think there is at least one thing we can all agree on . This is CHAD EVERETT's best performance in years . Why do we give awards to semi-moronic blockbusters like " Titanic " and " Pearl Harbor " and ignore the recklessly innovative work of directors like the Coens and Lynch ? If you miss this , you will be missing a lot .
443309	819382	51196	9.0	Thoroughly Successful 50s Comedy .	What a neatly done job this is . Tony Randall is Rock Hunter , a minor functionary at a Madison Avenue advertising agency ( this is a 1950s comedy and Mad Ave was the target of many jokes ) . He's about to be furloughed from his organization and then , by accident , manages to nail the outrageous Jayne Mansfield for her endorsement of the Stay-Put Lipstick account . Jayne doesn't care about the account but she wants to make her boyfriend back in Hollywood jealous so she pretends to be Randall's sex slave . An embarrassed Randall goes along with it . It all creates more ripples than Brittany Spears and Fed Ex or other couples of that ilk . Pretty much everything works . The director , Frank Tashlin , knew his way around a comedy , having been responsible for a number of cartoons . He recognizes a good sight gag when he sees one . Watch the door open and the diminutive Tony Randall appear , back lighted , dressed in the over-sized suit of a muscle man , and wearing elevator shoes , staggering around like Frankenstein's monster . He knows his hilarious dialog too . Randall is speaking to Mansfield's boyfriend , Bobo Branigansky , and pretending to be president of his ad agency . " Of course I'm the president - - but Miss Marlowe will be the TITULAR head of the company . " Mansfield shrieks with delight , grabs Randall , and gives him an open-mouthed kiss , smothering half his face with her huge , blubbery lips . In a later scene , after having half his clothes ripped off by frenzied fans , Randall is offered a drink by the sympathetic Joan Blondell . Asked what he'd like , the morose Randall replies - - " I don't know . Make it something simple , a bottle and a straw . " I don't want to give away any more of the gags , and the story isn't so convoluted that it hasn't already been limned in . Let me add , though , that it's exceptionally well acted by everyone involved . Note , in particular , one long speech done in a single take with Henry Jones , as he explains to Tony Randall that success is nothing more than being in the right place at the right time . How dull it could have been . Yet Jones , with his passionate , dramatic , outrageous sing-song , makes it both gripping and extremely funny . It's my understanding that the movie doesn't follow the play closely but I don't care . It has its own highly original touches . The movie is interrupted , for instance , by Randall who addresses the " TV fans in the audience " and demonstrates the failures of the luminescent orb in a way that makes us appreciate HDTV all the more . That scene couldn't have been in the play . See it if you have the chance , even if you've seen it before . It's anodyne . It will chase the blues away .
441841	819382	113309	9.0	God is in the details	A very good docudrama . But you must be in the mood . It's a low-budget enterprise , talky , and with no bravura performances . Why is it good , then ? I guess it's because it makes certain demands on the intelligence and moral concerns of the viewer that few other renditions of this story have bothered to even attempt . For many years , the United States mythos handled the issue in the most simplistic way . The Japanese were all kamikazes , an invasion of the Japanese homeland would cost untold thousands of lives , so we had to nuke them . Recent revisionist history has given us another version of what happened . The Japanese were on their last legs and they knew it . They were sending out peace feelers through Sweden , Switzerland , and Russia . The United States ignored these because we wanted revenge , so we had to nuke them , and fast . This film illustrates exceedingly well both the Japanese and American sides of the issue , with restraint and intelligence . There are neither heroes nor villains here . And no easy shots are made at particular figures . We can often tell , in conventional flicks , who is good and who is bad by the simple expedient of seeing whether a given character is handsome or homely . We tend not to notice this casting sleight of hand in our own movies because the difference in appearance supports our own prejudices . ( We want the villain to be ugly . ) But if you want this trick to be in your face , take another look at " The Cranes are Flying , " a Russian war movie in which the American officer looks and sounds like a fat bumbling idiot , while the Russian commander is ruggedly good-looking and wears a tolerant shrink-like smile . Such cheap symbolism certainly isn't committed here . The commander of the Japanese army , who wants to fight to the last man , is both attractive and highly principled . Truman may not be a brilliant thinker but he is down-home shrewd and up front about everything . ( If there is a problem with the casting it is that the actor playing Curtis LeMay is too handsome and polite for the part . LeMay was a courageous , ruthless , cigar-smoking blowhard , whom no one but a mother would call handsome . ) So why was the bomb dropped ? Evidently through a series of stochastic misunderstandings - - in intentions , exchanges , even in the translation of particular words . And ultimately in the rush of the United States to end the war - - for any number of reasons , including strictly political ones - - and in the desire on the part of the Japanese to find some sort of honorable peace in which their emporer retained his sanctity , leading to actions too deliberate to satisfy the Allies . The film is at its weakest in posing a false dilemma . ( Or maybe the historical characters were responsible . ) ( 1 ) We invade the islands , or ( 2 ) we nuke them without warning . All the possibilities in between are dismissed for one reason or another . One of them , given short shrift , is the possibility of a naval blockade which would shut off all supplies and cancel all naval traffic from the islands . Japan having no natural resources worth mentioning , it would have been only a matter of time before it worked . Loss of life would have been minimal , and we would not have had to use the bombs - - plural , Nagasaki was destroyed only three days after Hiroshima . One of the reasons repeatedly brought up in favor of using the bomb is that the American taxpayer has put out two billion dollars for this gadget , and if it weren't used they would want to know why their money was spent developing it . ( I don't know of any words adequate to describe this sort of logic . ) A blockade , however , would have taken more time , which would have involved waiting , which is not our strong suit . Another weakness is that James F . Byrne was a personal friend of Truman's . Truman , uncertain and new to the presidency , looked at him as a font of wisdom . And Byrne was a devoted hawk . This isn't made entirely clear , but it was in fact the case . Well , who knows what we and the Japanese should have done ? Easy enough to make retrospective judgments . However , they should perhaps be made anyway . Maybe knowing what went wrong last time will help us prevent things from going so terribly wrong next time .
443359	819382	35616	9.0	Exemplary Hawks	An exciting , touching , and funny movie , one of Hawks ' best . It's a richly textured work , with several sub-narratives weaved into one another . The most important is the voyage of the new B-17 , the " Mary Ann " , from California to Honolulu to Wake Island to Clark Field in the Phillipines . Movies about journeys can be exciting , if they're well done , as this one is . There is the change of scenery , the dramas large and small at the stopovers , and above all the living that goes on within the vehicle . There is a lot of model work involved , out of necessity , but it has a reassuring cartoonish quality . I loved those wooden miniature airplanes taking off without lifting their noses , as if levitating rather than flying . And the tiny papier-mache palms , and the fake studio jungles . Within the limits of the available technology , it's pretty well done . As the model B-17 taxis its way across the tarmac , we can even hear the squealing of its brakes as the pilot applies them . The voyage is fascinating not just because we are following the Mary Ann , but because we get to know what it's like to live inside the fuselage , to fly and defend the airplane , to work on its engines and to feed it gasoline by using a bucket brigade . Most of all we get to know the tiny social system of the men and how they are knitted together by circumstances into a solidary group . This is true Hawks territory . Here we have John Garfield as the cynical flight-school washout Winocki . ( Cf . , Christopher Walken's monologue in " Pulp Fiction . " ) Garfield sneers at the others and hates the skipper , the good-natured , efficient , and highly respected James Ridgely as " Irish " Quincannon . Ridgely tries to explain to Garfield that it doesn't matter what any single person's feelings are . We are all part of a team here ; each of us depends on the other ; we support and help one another ; we'd give each other our last pair of socks ; in fact , two of the crew are married to each other . ( Well - - not that . ) Garfield is finally won over after the attack on Pearl Harbor . ( Kids , that was the beginning of World War II for us . PS : We won . ) The way the crew learns the news is just plain fine . What craftsmanship . The radioman is sitting at his console and loses contact with Honolulu before picking up some gunshots and Japanese chatter . It's a sign of the care that was taken in this film that we get to appreciate the job that the RADIOMAN is doing ! In almost every other film involving a bombers we get to know only the pilots and the gunners - - sometimes the bombardier . But in this case we get to see the kind of job everyone does , including the crew chief , and , in a suspenseful miniepisode , the navigator . The NAVIGATOR ! Usually if he's included at all , it's only to get his head blown off . Hawks is fond of the gradual integration of an outsider into the group , the willing penetration of social borders . Sometimes it's a " girl , " as in , " Only Angels Have Wings . " ( When Jean Arthur sits down to play the guys ' piano , Cary Grant advises her , " You'd better be good . " ) Here it's Garfield , who begins by hating the Air Corps and ends by being a fully functioning team member , and an innovative leader . If that's not enough , we have yet another playful rivalry between the Mary Ann's crew and a passenger they pick up - - a pursuit pilot who jokes about the furniture vans that bomber crews have to fly around in . Does he turn into a fully functioning team member at the end too ? Yes , he does , although as far as we know he's had to multi-engine time at all . No matter . The essence of Hawks ' fascination with male solidarity is probably best expressed in the scene in which the Mary Ann is being attacked over a ( fictional ) Japanese fleet . As a Zero homes in on the B-17 from a given position , the gunner on that side yells out to the captain , " Swing her a little to the left ! " , and Ridgely makes the airplane yaw slightly to give the gunner a better shot at the Zero . Let me put this another way - - an enlisted gunner is telling the captain of the airplane what to do . And the officer happily complies . That is teamwork . The crew transcend their individuality . They're like a single organism . " Irish " dies towards the end in a scene that could have been so much cornier than it is . ( Faulkner is said to have written part of it . ) Everyone of importance is in the death scene and plays a part . The movie practically falls apart at the end , unfortunately . Our airplanes seem to blow the entire Imperial Japanese Navy out of the water in a battle that resembles nothing of historical value . And yet even the final scene , of the Mary Ann crash landing in the rolling surf , is exciting enough to help us forget the obvious propaganda of the previous scene . The problem , though , is that the racism runs all the way through the film . Okay , let's accept dialog like , " Fried Jap going ' down ! " , when a Zero explodes . But the Japanese in Hawaii are treated as treacherous cowards , which , by the time of this movie's release , should have been a myth long dispelled . Of course there was never any sabotage . They were American citizens before they were Japanese . Anyway , an outstanding adventure movie . Nothing arty or pretentious , simply a nicely executed work . One of the best films to be made during the war .
442818	819382	47472	9.0	Charming MGM Musical .	The eldest of the seven Pontiphy brothers ( Howard Keel ) , who live in a filthy ramshackle farmhouse in the Idaho mountains of 1850 , comes to town looking for a wife . He finds one in the person of Jane Powell , a cook in the local boarding house . Powell works her buns off cleaning up this pig stye and making dinner . She loves him , see , but to him , as he puts it , " One woman's pretty much like another . " What a family this is . To call them " swine " is an insult to swine . They're like a bunch of reprobates rounded up to be deloused by the Salvation Army . They fight all the time . And when Powell demands that they surrender their long johns to the laundry , one of them discovers that his buttons are missing and his underclothes have been stitched together . That's how long it's been since he was out of them . Powell manages to get them in shape , at least superficially , teaching them manners and seeing that they dress in clean working clothes . Keel and Powell take the newly tamed brothers to a competitive barn raising . Provoked by their opposition , they punch the other men out and fall in love with their girl friends . They spend some time mooning over the women until Keel finally mobilizes them . Following the example set by the Romans and the Sabine women in Jane Powell's copy of " Plutarch's Lives , " they ride into town , kidnap the girls , and abscond with them to the farmhouse , sealed off now until Spring by an avalanche . Lamentably , they forgot to kidnap a preacher . Powell is shocked and the six women are hysterical . The men must sleep in the barn until Spring , when they finally get to meet their brides and bond with them . By the time the families reach the farm , everyone is eager for marriage . The story has a fey quality . Due to budget restrictions , the film was shot entirely on a sound stage but , fortunately , the sets and backgrounds give the impression of deliberate stylization rather than penury . ( Another musical of the period , " Brigadoon " , didn't come off too well on a stage . ) The brides are largely indistinguishable - - except for Julie Newmar who would stand out in any crowd . And the MEN - - some of the busiest and best-known dancers in show business - - Jacques D'Amboise , Matt Mattox , Tommy Rall , and Russ Tamblyn , for instance . Well , Russ Tamblyn was a gymnast rather than a dancer but he fits nicely into this exalted company . ( You ought to hear D'Amboise speak in his native Brooklynese : " Da goil has as hahd a job as da man . " ) The brides are quite skilled too , especially Nancy Kilgas as Alice , who is petite and enchanted and an exquisite talent . I don't want to carry on too much about dancers but it's a tough and demanding racket . Anybody can act . Anybody can sing . I know because I can do both , miserably . Actors can be chosen for their looks or their voices . Danny Aiello was discovered working on the subway . Ben Johnson was a horse wrangler . Lana Turner , famously and probably apocryphally , was discovered sitting on a stool in Schwab's Drug Store in Hollywood . Vera Miles was Miss Oklahoma . See what I mean ? But nobody ever saw someone on the subway and said , " How would you like to come to Hollywood and be a dancer ? " It's a psychokinetic talent that you must be born with and cultivate with some devotion . You have to be as fit as a running back and must learn to direct that physical force into precisely defined channels . I know , because I can't do it . Rather than go on , let me just suggest you watch the barn raising sequence in " Seven Brides for Seven Brothers " and keep track of Michael Kidd's muscular choreography . The story may be a fairy tale but the male dancers are anything but pixillated . Howard Keel is bluff and masculine . Jane Powell is tiny and winsome . Both are professional singers , and Powell can dance in a controlled fashion as well . The songs vary from mock melancholy to exuberant and Johnny Mercer's rude lyrics can be sly . " I'm a lonesome polecat . . . can't make no vows , to a herd of cows . . . a man can't sleep , when he sleeps with sheep . . . can't shoot the breeze , with a bunch of trees . " Most musicals are notable chiefly for their songs . The plots are discountable ( eg . , Fred and Ginger ) or , if more ambitious , just boring ( eg . , " An American in Paris " ) . But this story , like a few others ( eg . , " The Bandwagon " or " Singin ' in the Rain " ) can , like Jane Powell's stew , " stand on its own two feet . " No point going much further . See it . You'll enjoy it .
442955	819382	53291	9.0	Snappy and hilarious	It isn't the first time men were in drag on the screen and certainly not the last , but surely it must be the funniest example . I'll skip the plot and just make a few offhand observations . One is that the writers put a near-perfect polish on this script . They didn't simply throw gags and comic situations into the story hoping they would all add up to a funny movie . Instead they worked running gags into the dialog . Some of them are so utterly without symbolic - - or even sensible - - content that they become in themselves sidesplitting . " Type O blood . " It must come up half a dozen times in outrageously irrelevant contexts . And one that took me at least ten viewings to catch . I will now spell it out in case anyone out there is as dull as I've been . Near the beginning , when Joe and Jerry are still Joe and Jerry , Joe pitches some woo to Nellie Wymeyer in order to borrow her car , a Hupmobile 1929 . An hour into the film , long after this brief exchange has been forgotten , Josephine has cornered Sugar on " his " yacht and explains to her the origin of his impotence . It's an imaginative and tragic tale . It seems he met his only true love at the Grand Canyon . She was as blind as he was . They stood together on the edge of the highest cliff . He took off his glasses . She took off her glasses . He took a step towards her . She took a step towards him . " Oh , no ! " cries Sugar . " Yes . Eight hours later they brought her up - - by mule . " That's not the running gag though . The running gag is that while Josephine is improvising this blatantly phony yarn , making it up as he goes along , free associating , he mentions that the girl he loved was named Nellie and that her father was president of Hupmobile . Absolutely nothing more is made of the connection between Nellie Wymeyer's Hupmobile and this baloney Josephine is slicing - - in fact he skips rather blithely over it . I don't think I'll give away any other gags , which means I can't really describe the movie in any detail . But mention should be made of the score and the arrangements of the contemporary tunes , for which I guess Adolph Deutsch is responsible . They're wacky when that's called for and sweet in an old-fashioned way when ballads are required . " Stairway to the Stars " has never sounded so romantic , and " I'm Through With Love " more wistful . ( Catch the key change after Monroe finishes singing . ) The underscore is remarkable too - - a frenetic combination of bass and tenor saxophone . ( What else ? ) Monroe seems a bit thick waisted but it doesn't detract from her sex appeal because she's so Hollywood gorgeous . That transparent dress she almost has on during her love scene with Tony Curtis doesn't dampen her appeal either . The two male leads give unimpeachable performances . I know Tony Curtis has often been criticized for his " mannerisms " and his accent but they fit his character well enough in the Bing Crosby part , while Jack Lemon couldn't be improved upon in the Bob Hope part of the continually hoodwinked , constantly cackling breathlessly . All the supports are just about right too . Sid Polyakoff - - " Spielt mit der PhilharMONic ! " And where on this planet did casting find all those goons who play George Raft's companions . " These are my lawyers . All Harvard men . " Those FACES . I can't find anything bad to say about the movie . It's funny from beginning to end . If you haven't seen it yet , you owe it to yourself to catch it when you have a chance .
443064	819382	74937	9.0	One of Neil Simon's Funniest	Simon is good at barbed exchanges , as in most of " The Odd Couple . " But he has a tendency to get serious sometimes and it rarely works , even when the serious ones have some occasional good one-liners in them . His drama tends to be dull , and his comedies funny , especially in domestic contexts and when they're dialogue dependent . This is different from his other familiar works . He really lets go here , forgets all about serious undertones , " meaningfulness , " depth of relationships , domesticity , continuity - - everything except the comic effect . He's the Edgar Allan Poe of comedy here . He hasn't written such a funny script since " After the Fox . " The plot itself , after the broth is reduced , is simple enough . Truman Capote invites five of the world's most famous detectives to a weekend at his spooky country mansion , tells them a murder will be committed at midnight , and challenges them to solve it or lose their reputations . What follows is hilarious . Not just sharply funny exchanges but entire situations that are in themselves outrageous , so that the verbal elements are like icing on the cake . It's the kind of movie in which a line like , " My chauffeur was injured by a falling gargoyle while standing outside in Chinese footprints , " makes an idiotic kind of sense . A movie in which a character can offer this as an explanation for his having been found in a gay bar : " I hate them queeries . Lots of dames go in those places anyway . I never kissed nobody . And I never done anything to a man that I wouldn't do with a woman . " A movie in which two old ladies are about to fall asleep in bed when one of them sniffs and says , " I smell gas . " The second says : " I can't help it . I'm old . " The first says , " No , no . Not THAT kind of gas . The other kind . The kind that KILLS . " And the second begins a reply with , " Sometimes MY gas . . . . " I could go on with these gags but why spoil it ? And anyway there are sight gags and situational discombobulations that are just as funny but would take far too long to describe . Not all of the gags and situations are equally funny . ( How could they be ? ) Nancy Walker plays a mute maid who's purpose in the movie eludes me . And some of the gags are silly rather than funny . But the weaknesses are minor and more than made up for by the movie's many virtues . Especially good is Peter Falk's Sam Diamond , who does an insane impression of Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade . The actor played the same character in the later , less-successful " The Cheap Detective . " Simon even allows himself to play with the frame at the end . Falk and Eileen Brennan ( " my secretary and mistress " ) are driving away from the mansion and Brennan says , " I guess this means we won't be seeing each other anymore , Sam . " Falk : " Well , Angel , you can never tell . I'll be around . And if you need me , all you gotta do is whistle . You know how to whistle , don't you ? " Brennan : " Well , of course I know how to whistle , Sam . What a silly question . Everybody knows how to whistle - - " Falk looks disgusted , turns away from her to stare into the camera , and says , " Allright , allright . Forget it . You ruined it . " I won't go on any longer about this sometimes extremely amusing film . Anything I would say would ruin it , although I must add that this is one of those movies you can watch and enjoy repeatedly , and without necessarily being in exactly the right mood for it - - unlike , say , Marx Brothers movies or W . C . Fields . It's one of the most laugh-ridden products of its decade . Watch it .
