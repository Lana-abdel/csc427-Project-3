442233	819382	89927	1.0	This isn't Mike Tyson , this is Woody Allan	It poses as another epic boxing movie but it boils down to a piffle . I can't believe the positive comments this piece of garbage has received . Is there no end to our lack of taste ? It's a " guilty pleasure " only in the sense that having a dominatrix snap a wet towel at your bare buns in a guilty pleasure . Rocky goes through his usual homey and decidedly low-tech training routine , schlepping a huge log up a mountainside , carrying it like a yoke across his shoulders . ( Oh , Lord , let us hope this wasn't intended as a religious allusion . ) Dolf Lundgren , who cannot act , is a sullen Aryan monster . He's given a lousy haircut , in case we might not get the point , and even sports a black mouthpiece in the ring , in case we missed the haircut too . Stallone almost always has non-Latins in the role of the heavies . A couple of African-Americans , an Irish gang in Paradise Alley , a Nordic here , an Eskimo there . I wonder if he knows exactly what he's trying to tap into , what tribal animadversions are oozing out of his cortical sulci . He practically converts the Soviet Union to capitalism at the end . And all those years we were sending people like Louis Armstrong and Benny Goodman around as Goodwill Ambassadors . Let's see . Drago - - great name ! - - can land a punch that packs 2 , 000 pounds per square inch . That's 131 . 5789474 times the force of gravity at sea level . And Rocky comes away from that final bout looking put upon . And all I have to do is look in the mirror to see what gravity alone is doing to my face ! Watching this - - this - - thing - - I couldn't tear myself from the screen , any more than I could pass a highway accident without gawking at it . What an execrable piece of movie-making crap .
442072	819382	404456	1.0	Beyond Description	There is a fine movie about the serial murderer Charlie Starkweather and his hostage / girl friend Karil Ann Fugate out there . Its title is " Badlands . " There is also a very good TV movie on the subject , starring Tim Roth . This thing is so bad that no words can describe it . Everything about it is less than poor . It's not just the low budget . With imagination and talent that kind of obstacle can be overcome - - " Mean Streets " , " The Honeymoon Killers , " " The Littlest Fugitive , " " The Savage Eye , " " Detour . " But this abortion lacks not just money but everything . The acting , or rather its absence . Not only isn't there a decent performance from anyone in the cast . Some are so bad that I've seen better in high school productions of " Our Town . " The sheriff is probably the worst , but they're all bad . The editing . Continuing with the sheriff's disarticulation , please note what happens on the screen when he has a line . ( " A line " because he reads them as if they didn't come in packages . ) The camera shows us the sheriff's grim and uninteresting face . Seconds pass . Finally he speaks . " If they want to go out in a blaze o ' glory , this is their chance . " The camera lingers for a few seconds more on his face although he has nothing more to say and the muscles of his face remain marmoreal . After a few scenes like this the effect on the viewer is that of a hypnotic drug - - and not even a good HIGH first , but a precipitate drop in consciousness of the sort you get from chloral hydrate . The direction . Abominable . Nobody can hold a gun still . It must be jerked around or waved from side to side , or jabbed as if shoveling dirt . Even when a lawman takes a bead on a window he waves his rifle as if it were a magician's wand . Location : Not Nebraska farmland but clearly the Mojave Desert in California . I can't go on with this , really . I hate to dump on people and this is no fun . It's more embarrassing than anything else . Reminds me of a professor who once told us that when we wrote our term papers we should do our very best . Then he paused for a moment and mused out loud , " What if you did your very best and it turned out pedestrian ? " Okay . Fair and balanced , right ? There are two valuable things in this movie . There are some nice shots of vintage 1940s and 1950s cars , though sometimes mislabeled . And this film would serve as a very good bad example in any film school .
441745	819382	104236	1.0	Poor Me	Shelley Long is a delight to watch , with that oddly appealing Midwestern freshness , and Helen Shaver is reliable , as always . Neither of them can salvage this movie . It's just plain awful . It's based on a true story , also available in a fat true-crime paperback , " Once Upon a Memory , " mainly dealing with the " recovered memory " of Eileen Franklin after 20 years of amnesia , of witnessing her father , a thorough-going no good drunken bum , rape and murder Eileen's 8-year-old friend on a road near Foster City , California . He'd been abusing his two daughters for years . The case raises a host of interesting questions . Eileen's " memory " comes to her as a shock in her late 20s , two decades after the murder . At the urging of her husband , who could probably foresee the TV movie , she contacts the police . They track down her father , now living in humble circumstances in Sacramento , and arrest him , convict him , and send him to the slams with a life sentence . The movie never touches on the questions it raises in the viewer's mind . It presents the story through the eyes of poor Eileen who , throughout , is shown as victimized and filled with anguish and conflict . How can she bring herself to testify to this horrible incident in open court ? Can she send her father away for life , and alienate her siblings ? It never asks questions like " when is a memory not a memory " ? It doesn't bring up the fact that Eileen's story changed to accommodate itself to the facts as she became aware of them from talking to others and generally researching her case . The errors in her original memory were gradually corrected . ( Initially she " remembered " the sun behind her father's head as he lifted the rock to smash little Suzie's head . When it was pointed out to her that at that time of day , the sun couldn't have been positioned as she claimed , the sun simply changed position . Initially she described her father's silhouette as having rainbow-like bars radiating from it . When a classic psychedelic poster of Bob Dylan with bars around his head was discovered tacked to her bedroom wall , the rainbow disappeared from her " memory . " ) I don't doubt the real Eileen Franklin's sincerity . In interviews she has seemed as puzzled as anyone else and responds to doubtful queries with a by-now well-practiced stock answer : " If these things didn't happen , then where do these memories come from " ? Of course , no one knows , any more than they did in Salem in 1693 . The movie doesn't mention that part of her " memory " was recovered while she was in a hypnotic trance , which always helps . As a psychologist I once hypnotized a client who described in the minutest detail how he heard about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . He was only a few years old and coming downstairs to breakfast in his Pennsylvania home that morning . Only the " memory " revealed itself as a fabrication to please the therapist , beginning with the fact that it was early afternoon Pennsylvania-time . This is a genuinely bad film . Eileen ruins her father , who is described as a " pervert " because a search of his room turns up some pornography , and embarrasses everyone , while her friends pet her and cosset her . Poor me . Her early career in prostitution is brushed over as a cliched attempt to exercise some control over her hapless life . This movie was shot in 1991 . It was probably the last gasp of the recovered memory hysteria . I wonder how many other innocent lives were ruined , how many perverts like Mr . Franklin wound up with 30-year-sentences , how many preschools raided and closed , how many Satanists finally put away , and all because we don't want to be " a culture that doesn't trust our children . " Well , I for one wouldn't stake my life on their telling the truth all the time . Or adults either , for that matter . The main problem with the film is that it isn't Eileen Franklin who should be pitied . It's just about anyone who came in contact with her .
442117	819382	50622	2.0	Slightly Revolting	A helicopter with three Navy officers , led by Jock Mahoney , and the requisite woman reporter aboard , Shawn Smith , gets caught in bad weather over Antarctica and must land through a heavy cloud layer to find they are at the bottom of a volcanic valley . But wait a minute . This is not just ANY hot , steamy tropical jungle in Antarctica . This one is really old , inhabited by plants beasts that disappeared millions of years ago . It is also inhabited by the sole survivor of an earlier expedition , Henry Brandon . The half loco Brandon has the part necessary to repair the Navy's damaged helo - - a " push-pull rod " - - but he's hoarding his equipment because he wants to trade what they want for what he wants , namely the shapely Shawn Smith . And who can blame him ? I mean , ten years ? ( The fact that Henry Brandon is reputed to have been gay adds a shiver of irony to the plot . ) Well , everyone is attacked at one time or another by prehistoric dinosaurs but they allsurvive and escape , including Brandon who has come to his senses at the last moment and discovered his humanity . Brandon isn't much of an actor . He's probably best known for his role as Scar in John Ford's " The Searchers . " ( " You speak good Comanche . Someone teach you ? " ) But his modest talent doesn't make him conspicuous in the context of this film . The other performers are no better . The most interesting cast member is Jock ( nee Jacques ) Mahoney , a stunt man raised in Iowa , and one of the best in the business . Among other memorable acts caught on film , he did the spectacular leap down the staircase onto Robert Douglas's villain in Errol Flynn's " The Adventures of Don Juan . " His name ranks up there with Canutt , Eason , Perry , and Dar Robinson . Not that Mahoney is muscle bound . You don't need to be a body builder to be a stunt man . You need to be lithe , professional , competitive , intelligent , and you to be completely lacking a sympathetic nervous system . The men and women who do stunts don't have to be good actors , as Mahoney proves here . They're a proudgroup - - can I generalize like this ? - - but not snooty . They don't feel they're humbling themselves if they hang around with the extras , as I know from experience . Mahoney was a parent to Sally Field . I don't like going on like this about stunt people but there's so little to say about the movie . The monsters are gaggingly cheap . The first shot we get of them is two ordinary monitor lizards , blown up to dinosaur size by photographic legerdemain , and they're tearing each other to pieces , literally . These are big animals and here they are throwing themselves around and chewing on limbs and heads . We can see the ripped skin . Nobody can claim that no animals were harmed in making this movie . I found it a little disgusting . The other minatory dinosaur is a T . rex - - and it's a hoot : a man dressed in a flabby plastic suit dragging a tail behind him . Another monster never lived - - a kind of gigantic pumpkin with tentacles . It eats a cute little mammal . I don't think it's a tarsier , though Mahoney the expert calls it such . Still , they got the time and the animal reference right . At least , I think the Eocene tarsoids lived about 60 million years ago . I was certainly happy to see the five humans get out of there at the climax . It meant the end of the movie .
443094	819382	106527	2.0	Narcissists	A depressing tale of a middle-aged man and teen-aged girl who have an affair , presumably , after which the girl shoots the guy's wife in the head , so that the girl and the guy can get married , or at least live together , happily ever after . It's based on the real events surrounding Aimee Fisher and Joey Buttafuco . She's played my Alyssa Milano , in probably her most demanding role , and the car mechanic is Jack Scalia . What a tawdry tale . A narcissistic pedophile and a spoiled pretty nymphomaniac . Lots of sex , intrigue , conflict , some violence , all rather disgusting , which is probably why three independent TV made-for movies about the case hit the TV screens at the same time . This one is definitely from Butaffuco's point of view . The poor guy loves his wife and children ( sob ) and never touches this succulent nymphet . Fisher is plumply overdeveloped , more than simply enticing , bursting her seams , and she's the aggressor and the liar in the tale . Buttafuco is the innocent victim . Right . No ex coke addicted , pumped up , self-admiring Italian philanderer would dream of laying a paw on this fawning young creature . Man , is he put upon . Our eyes water at the narrative . Aimee lies to her family and tells them that Joey gave her herpes . Then tries to murder his wife . And all this time he's nothing more than a cheerful , loving , family man and upright citizen , aghast at all the terrible things he's accused of . Did he fund this movie ? The other two made-fors took quite different points of view , depending on who was backing the production and which particular participant in this disgusting tale was doing the endoresements . Utterly revolting garbage , which the public ate up . Alyssa Milano is a beautiful young woman . Anyone who wants to see her en deshabille should rent " Kiss of the Vampire " or whatever it was , far sexier , and less repugnant simply because it is more mindless . This movie actually has a point of view . It could have skipped the sleazy plot and just shown us Joey pumping iron in a gym and Aimee coupling in some stranger's back seat . An insult to the public viewer , who gobbled it down with relish .
443079	819382	76150	2.0	Utter schlock , even by slasher standards .	It's a murder mystery cum slasher movie built around the goings-on at a Catholic church . The little girls are lined up backstage for their appearance at their first holy communion . Brooke Shields , the last in line , is strangled and her body stuffed into a window seat and set afire . That's the good part . The audience gets to see the killer too , but he or she is all dressed up in an oil slicker like the Gloucester Fisherman and wears a halloween mask of a smiling young girl . Suspicion is immediately cast on another young girl , Alice , and for good reason . She showed up late for the service , is seen coveting and hiding a veil that may have belonged to Shields , and owns an oil slicker , a mask , and a butcher knife . Also , boy , is she a waspy thing , insulting , shrieking angrily at everyone , especially her critical aunt , ridiculing a tenant in her apartment house who is morbidly obese . This obese guy is great . He can't act but he looks perfect , with his shaved head and goatee . He listens to scratchy opera records and mopey old torch songs , keeps a room full of kittens , and doesn't clean up his apartment . I suppose the opera and his effeminate tone are designed to suggest his sexual orientation , but then he puts moves on the eleven-year-old Alice , which simply confuses things . I guess he's polymorphously perverse . But , if the truth be told , you hardly notice the confusion because in fact the marginal utility of his sexual orientation is so low . The confusion is already so bountiful that , following Weber's law of just-noticeable-differences , the guy's homosexuality makes hardly a dent . During some of the killings , the violins shriek exactly like those in Hitchcock's superb " Psycho . " I won't go on too much longer . The murders multiply . Father Tom , at the church , is the only guy we can possibly identify with . He looks the part and sounds reasonable . There's blood all over the place after the initial strangling . Alice's aunt goes , Alice's estranged father goes ( I think ) , the fat guy goes , Father Tom goes - - all bathed in blood . I was sorry to see Brooke Shields get it so early , and in her first movie too . But I didn't believe she was eleven years old . I believe she's never been eleven years old , but that she's always been a middle-aged midget , parading her cuteness around like Shirley Temple did before her . Wild horses couldn't drag the identity of the murderer from me , but I will say that the reveal comes as a shock . It's rather like Thelma Ritter turning out to be the murderer in " Rear Window . " And there's just as much motivation , which is to say none at all . To cap it off , after the murderer is apprehended during mass , Sweet Alice leaves the church , stunned , and on the way she opens a bag she's been carrying and therein lies - - a butcher knife , which she partly withdraws in the most sinister fashion . What this is supposed to signify is , well , there are some things man was never meant to know , and this is one of them . As a minor carp , I didn't particularly like the way that Catholic liturgy is put on display as if this were all a freak show . The mass is in Latin ( gosh ! ) , the communicants are seen from Father Tom's point of view with their tongues hanging out , and there are other grotesqueries , such as religious icons made to look like the garish and spooky figures in Madame Tussaud's . What a meretricious kettle of fish .
442686	819382	100934	2.0	That's it ! Engorge the feijoada !	The first time Carrie Otis appears on screen , she is a newly minted international lawyer at a job interview . She's breathless , anxious , and sounds fake . I thought she was doing the character , but in reality that was it . That's all she has for the entire movie . And Mickey Rourke ? Did someone whisper to him that he was the sexiest man alive , or what ? He does his best with Feminine Fantasy Number One , the mysterious , masculine , empathic self-made man who is filthy rich , but he simply can't pull it off without a French accent . Jacqueline Bisset's character should carry a sign around her neck - - " Bitch . " There's not much point in going on about the plot , something out of a shoebox , which provides at least some material for a travelogue , though there have been better attempts to capture Rio ( " Black Orpheus , " eg . ) . The story gives Rourke a hang up . He can't stand to be touched - - let alone the other thing . But , no fear , Otis overcomes his inhibitions by the power of her pulchritude so we can end with a nearly explicit coupling . He turns out to be robustly masculine after all . Is that what " wild orchid " means ? I mean , is it some kind of terribly mangled PUN ? Here are some examples of the dialog . " Sometimes we all have to lose ourselves a little in order to find ourselves . " And Otis : " I'm sorry , " to which Rourke replies , " It's not you - - it's me . " A sex scene dissolves into shots of the morning surf rolling in . Otis does in fact have one thing going for her , a slight lisp , in addition to her strong and attractive face and her robust figure . Rourke , though some sort of cryptohypnotism , has talked a bickering German couple into coupling in the back of a stretch limo while he and Otis watch . " Tell me what you see ? " Rourke asks her . " I thee two people having thexth . " There isn't anything much except thexth behind this excuse to cash in on the profits of Rourke's previous soft-core movie with Kim Basinger , and maybe take along some of the nut from " Emanuelle , " another story about a rich man introducing a sexy but deprived young woman into the glories of debauchery . It's fun watching someone penetrate the mystique , but as the sociologist Erving Goffman once observed , often the real secret behind the mystery is that there is no secret at all . Maybe that's why masks are so commonly seen in this film . But this is a feminine fantasy , co-written by a woman , and so instead of bikini-clad young blond girl leaping in slow motion to bat the volleyball , we have Speedo-clad young men leaping in slow motion to bat the volleyball . I prefer the girls but both images are pretty banal .
442421	819382	140352	2.0	Warning : Movie May Cause Boredom	Whether the defendant is a squealer or a whistle blower depends on which side of the social border the judge sits on . If the informant betrays secrets about an organization we support , then he's a squealer or a spy . If we hate the organization , then he's a civic-minded whistle blower . It's kind of like being a " terrorist " or a " freedom fighter . " In this case , there's no doubt that Jeffrey Wigand was a flawed but full-blown whistler . He tattled on " Big Tobacco , " as it's consistently called , a conspiratorial corporate entity everyone hates . What did he have to gain ? Not much . He admits to having a bad temper and feels he was fired " for no good reason , " but for most of us that would be a weak motive for risking your bountiful severance package and your family . ( Of course , who knows what's in a man's heart ? ) There are death threats that show up on his PC and a bullet appears in his mailbox , or so we are told . People may be " surveilling " him at places like a golf driving range . If so , the surveillers are pretty obvious about it . Writers , and viewers as well , need to be careful with this kind of material . After he was sent to jail , G . Gordon Liddy , a paranoid if there ever was one , describes in his book , " Will , " how he made killer enemies in prison and concluded that on a given night they were going to make an attempt on his life . He chose bravely to sleep out in the open with a blunt object for defense nearby . Nobody showed up that night . He believes his audacity frightened the killers off , whereas most reasonable readers would suspect that his enemies , like Son of Sam's social life , was all in his head . As it turns out , Wigand loses just about everything dear to him . Another brave whistle blower is Lowell Bergman the CBS producer who brings the whole tawdry story to light by blowing the whistle on CBS to the New York Times . He quits his job . ( The movie makes it appear that he quits immediately after his victory , whereas in fact he didn't quit until two years later . ) The question is : aside from making us feel good because , by means of all this sacrifice , Big Tobacco gets it in the chin , what other purpose is served ? What startling exposition is there in Wigand's suppressed interview ? Certainly not that cigarettes are bad for you . The Surgeon General's report demonstrated that in 1964 . And even that report was a redundancy since just about everyone , from scientists to morons , knew that cigarettes make you ill . The first use of the term " coffin nail " or " nail in your coffin " used in reference to cigarettes appears in 1888 , when cigarettes were just beginning to be used in addition to cigars and pipes . Here's a headline from the Chicago Daily Tribune , 15 July 1897 , " Unconscious From Cigaret Smoke : George Decker of Jersey City Succumbs to an Excessive Use of ' Coffin Tacks . ' " ( That's from Dictionary of American Regional English . ) In Chinese , the character representing " tobacco " is the same as that for " opium , " a stylized picture of a man imprisoned by four walls . There is an interesting datum on how ammonia compounds are added to tobacco to facilitate the impact of nicotine - - but that's the whole point of smoking . No one ever claimed that cigarettes TASTED good . Enhancing the impact of nicotine is an example of good old American know-how . At least from what we can see , the two main contributions of the controversial interview are ( 1 ) a demonstration that the CEOs lied when they testified that they did not believe tobacco was an addictive drug , and ( 2 ) sound bites - - " Cigarettes are nothing more than a delivery system for a drug . " ( We hear that last bite quoted 3 times . ) Well , Big Tobacco ( and little tobacco for that matter , if that term can be applied to users ) had already been demonized . The whole affair , in all its complexity , seems to have cemented even more firmly in place those prejudices most viewers will already hold . The film was careful not to indict smokers because , after all , these addicts go to the movies . And who wound up paying for all this ? Big Tobacco came under a great deal of expensive litigation , and remains there today . Penalties were levied on the corporations . The corporations passed these additional costs on to the users by tripling and quadrupling the cost of cigarettes . Most of the people who are addicted to cigarettes ( we're not talking about the conspicuous consumption of expensive cigars ) are middle and lower class . The result is a regressive tax , in which the chief burden falls on those least able to pay . Forty years ago , a carton of Camels could be had for 90 cents . Today , in New York , you pay between five and six dollars a pack . That's an increase of roughly 6 , 111 percent . ( I think . If that figure's wrong , it's my calculator's fault . ) One might think that , having finally brought the addictive properties of nicotine out into the open , the public and its representatives would feel some sympathy , or even pity , for its victims , but no such sentiment has surfaced . The hatred we feel towards smokers seems boundless and almost gleeful . Here's a poster on the door of a professor of social science in an Eastern university : " Cancer Cures Smoking , " in huge blood-red letters . The last time there was such widespread and righteous wrath must have been during the anti-communist fervor of the early 1950s . In return we have the satisfaction of feeling that we nailed Big and little Tobacco , and that we rooted for the right side in this really rather simple and exploitative movie .
442587	819382	178781	2.0	Bubble Bathos .	Plot : Dennis Cromwell ( Sam Bottoms ) is a prosperous banker with a wife and new baby girl in Marin County . He's friends with his roofer , Enrique ( Marco Rodrigues ) whose teen-aged daughter is Bottoms ' baby sitter . The perky daughter ( Yeniffer Behrens ) develops a crush on Bottoms and they begin an affair . She's also being stalked by a hook-nosed guy but forget that . The affair is discovered . Bottoms ' wife leaves him , taking the infant and the house with her . He's fired from the bank . He's charged with statutory rape and shunned by the community . Behrens is taken away from him , sobbing . He hasn't a friend left in the world . At the end he's involved in a homicide and Lord only knows what sort of moral terpitude he'll be charged with now . And all this time you thought Cromwell was a Puritan ? It's really difficult to describe this movie . The plot is done and redone , young girl has affair with older married man . " The Crush " is typical . Usually they stink although , as " Lolita " demonstrates , the story , if not the films , can be sublimely told . I don't know exactly whose fantasy this film is aimed at - - the middle-aged man lusting after the tan gymnasticized thighs of a 16-year-old baby sitter or the overpowering love of a naive but nubile girl for a powerful but understanding father figure . Probably both . The roots of these motives lie buried in evolutionary psychology . One of the theories advanced for the incest taboo , though , is well illustrated here . It mixes up the roles in the division of labor . The confusion manifests itself in jealousy or in some African societies in accusations of witchcraft . Nobody knows quite who belongs to whom or who's dominant . You cannot have two wimmin in the same house . Reckon that's a law of life . Signed : Prof . John Wayne , Director of Gender Studies . What is there to say about the movie ? The performances are somewhat below those found in TV commercials ? ( With the possible exception of Marco Rodriguez ' ? Rodriguez has a good scene in which he stands over the body of a recently murdered heavy and crosses himself . Then he spits on the body . ) The direction is flat and uninteresting ? The photography is ambitious but blurry ? The editing confusing ? ( See the scene in which Bottoms and Behrens run to each other and kiss hotly while the gym coach stands by aghast . Next shot , he's missing . ) The script ? People say things like : " We have to talk . " Twice . And once it's a man . Bottoms and Behrens walking along a beach having an earnest discussion about what to do with their lives . Behrens : " You know , in some countries we could be married . " Bottoms : " Yeah , but this isn't one of them . " Behrens : " I know . What a bummer . " It's too bad this is so little other than a minor soap opera because it was shot partly in Millbrae , one of the prettiest little towns on the San Francisco peninsula .
442920	819382	84777	2.0	Schlagfest	Dario Argento has been described as the new Hitchcock . God help us . Never mind the plot for the moment . Let's just address the technique . The only shot that remotely resembled something Hitchcock might have done was a long and involved movement of the camera up one side of a roof and down the other , lingering over interim unidentifiable architectural features like struts , seeming to turn upside down as it maunders along , spending so much time on the roof that we wind up on a first-name basis with every shingle , and all the while we must listen to the harsh clanging of drums and electronic instruments . The point of this elaborate and infinitely extended movement ? None . It's as if you'd handed an 8 mm . camera to a couple of high school freshman and told them , " Go out and rent a Hitchcock movie - - he's a movie director , see - - and then do a shot that imitates him . " Argento makes Brian DePalma look like Michelangelo . The photography is garish and unpleasant . There is gore galore , with the brachial artery of somebody's amputated arm spraying a kind of abstract expressionist pattern over an otherwise blank wall . The plot ? How to begin . Contrived . A maniacal Doberman chases a very nice girl with admittedly toothsome legs down an empty street in Rome and , just by chance , she escapes the dog by running inside a house chosen at random , except that , also by chance , it is currently occupied by the murderer . Contrived - - and illogical too . The first killing apparently takes place while the real murderer is not yet in Rome . The only scene I thought had the least merit involved John Saxon sitting on a cement bench and viewing the events , the minor dramas , taking place on the sidewalks around him . The scene doesn't last long . Unfortunately , the movie does .
443032	819382	75921	3.0	Women Can Be As Sloppy As Men !	A text prologue warns us that we should not allow evil to enter our house , but I think the more apt word is " entropy . " Good grief , what slobs these two babes are ! George ( Seymour Cassell ) is alone in his San Francisco office and his monstrously expensive home in Tiburon while his wife and child are away in San Diego . Two girls ( Sondra Locke as Jackson and Colleen Camp as Donna ) knock on his door , asking directions . Well , it's raining , and they're shivering like two drenched pitiful kittens , and they're not sure of the address they're looking for , and , what with one thing and another , George invites them to come in and partake of his pizza by the fire . All three of them wind up in George's bath tub and there follows about five minutes of mostly undifferentiated nudity in double exposure , triple exposure , quadruple exposure , and dodekakuple exposure . They spend the night in a threesome and the next morning the girls fix him breakfast . But something has gotten slightly cockeyed because Georgie's guests gobble everything down with their fingers and pour ketchup and syrup all over the linen and - - " You eat like ANIMALS ! " , George exclaims and tells them to get out . In his dreams . Now , don't get me wrong . Sondra Locke is an extraordinary looking young blond with cobalt-blue eyes and Colleen Camp bounces around like a superball . You gotta say , they breed ' em mighty cute down there in Shelbyville , Tennessee , where Locke comes from , and they breed ' em with bodacious tushes too , as we can't help but note after the first five or ten minutes . But when the girls go berserk , so does the movie . The film is thereafter bathed in a garish green light . The pair put on ghoulish makeup and make gargoyle faces at themselves in the mirrors . They brain a delivery boy and then drown him to make sure . They cuss up a storm and smash windows and furniture . They have one of those scenes in which two people sit across the table from one another , licking food and then jumping each other's bones . And Georgie ? They first render Georgie unconscious with mace ( which contains nothing that you can't find in that little red bottle of McIlheny's Tabasco sauce in your kitchen cabinet ) , tie him up , pour flour and milk all over him , subject him to a psychotic trial , put him through one of those Tolstoy-type semi-executions , slap him around , dress up in outlandish costumes , then prance out on him and his virtually destroyed upper-middle-class home , and are dispatched by a delivery van ex machina . As for the acting , it's as if someone had told Georgie , " First act polite to these girls , then act panicked after you're tied up . " And to the girls : " First act shy , unwilling to impose on anyone , then act crazy . " And that's it . The photography and location work are straight out of a 1970s porn movie . I'm not sure that suggests a total lack of skill . It takes effort and talent to turn San Francisco ugly . The score gives us two Leitmotivs . Georgie's is some pop tune with lyrics about " being free " and " giving in . " Jackson and Donna's is a catchy rinky-tink thing called " My Good Old Dad . " I approve of the moral lesson behind the story , though . There are some things you should simply not give in to , even though they might look like a lot of fun at first . All very educational .
442031	819382	60186	3.0	Aardvark .	I can't imagine why Bob Hope , a superb comedian in the 1940s , continued to grind out these rude lumps of deformity through the 1960s . It must have been the money . There were a couple of weaknesses consistent across this string of duds . One is that Bob Hope was simply not Bob Hope , and this one is a good demonstration of that proposal . He's an utterly bourgeois head of a relatively normal household - - sitcom standard , including the freakish cook and housekeeper Phyllis Diller in a fright wig . That's simply not the Bob Hope that everyone loved . Bob Hope is not your average family guy in a suit and tie . He's a sniveling coward , greedy and libidinous , and openly so . The second problem is that the gags stink . What happened to his writers ? Did they snore while grinding out this pap ? " Don't lose your head - - you might need it later on . " His wisecracks no longer fit his established persona . They're generic . Any comic could sling them around . ( They would still fall with a thud . ) Hope himself is older and has slowed down . Of course that's not his fault . " Fleeting time , thou hast left me old . " Still , it's painful to watch someone who was a fine physical actor reduced to showing that he could still walk with a bounce , but no more than that . He doesn't even move his head in a way that suggests suppleness . His facial expressions are limited ; his eyes don't bulge with fear . He's stiff all over . The plot is all fluff . Hope get mixed up with a fleeing international movie star , Elke Sommer , and tries to keep his wife , Marjorie Lord , from finding out . This involves hiding Didi in closets when the wife enters the room , dumping her into the cellar to hide her , and so forth . At least this running around might titillate the kids , but that's about it . Or - - no . Wait . Want a reason to watch this ? Elke Sommer runs around half naked through the entire movie and has a fine figure .
443225	819382	37121	4.0	Harmless Flag-Waver About Boot Camp .	A routine program filler with some familiar faces in the cast - - Rosco Karns , Robert Armstrong of " King Kong , " Horace McMahon in a walk-on . It's sort of a training film - - " What to Expect When You Join the Navy and What You Should Avoid Doing . " The opening narration tells us about the men in civilian clothes who are being marched into the Great Lakes Naval Training Center , " Yesterday , you lived in Glencoe , Illinois , in Hammond , Indiana , in Podunk , Nebraska . And you were a machinist , a clerk , a farmer , a philatelist ( well , not that ) , but today you're joining the Navy and you are sailors . " That's fine for the half dozen men whose careers we follow , but a little upsetting to Johnny Zumano , a boxer whose career was just getting started and who wanted to become a champ to provide for his impoverished parents . Johnny , whose story this chiefly is , gets over his initial frustration but when , on top of everything else , he is dumped by his girl friend he gets drunk and is about to be court martialed and discharged . Through the seasonable interposition of a gracious providence , the four-striper who is about to pull the lanyard on the guillotine of justice overhears Johnny talking to the chaplain . " Gee , I wanted to stay in the Navy something awful and ship out with the other fellas but I couldn't tell the Captain that . " Johnny has his pride , see , and he don't go whining to nobody . However , the Captain having overheard Johnny's confession , so to speak , now realizes how committed Johnny is to the U . S . Navy . Does Johnny avoid a discharge ? Does he join his comrades ? Do they ship out together ? No power on earth could drag the answers from me . It's a low-budget effort , true , and we can't expect too much in the way of acting or story or art direction . Yet , every time I tell myself that , I think of Val Lewton over at RKO who in the same time period was churning out one little gem after another on a similar budget , and horror pictures at that , with such unpromising titles as " The Leopard Man . " Or , ten years later , the inexpensive but vernacular art of the Scott-Boettiger Westerns . It's the difference between merely doing a job and showing some degree of craftsmanlike care in your product .
442357	819382	116253	4.0	Man Was Never Meant to Fly .	David Suchet and his Arabic-speaking goons hijack a 747 with the intention of exploding a bomb filled with nerve gas over Washington and wiping out the eastern seaboard . The hijackers demand the release of an Arab prisoner of indeterminate national origin . Washington is worried . They need not be . Not with Steven Seagal organizing his own squad of electronic wizards and commandos who board the airliner over the ocean . Seagal swiftly disappears from the plot , having business elsewhere , and the team of professionals is an ensemble led by Kurt Russel . This isn't a stupid movie like " Air Force One . " It's just another dumb action movie , and if it seems subdued in comparison with some , it's because you can't have multiple shoot outs with high body counts at a high altitude . So the movie perforce must rely on suspense in addition to every cliché in the Action Movie Handbook . As it is , there are several shootings that take place without , luckily , the slug passing through the recipient's body and then the hull of the airplane . The writers and producers don't trust you to be absorbed enough in the electronic innards of the 747 enough to sit through an hour with no bullets or blood . There is gore aplenty , though , once the airplane's altitude drops below 15 , 000 feet , enough to wake up the sleepiest , most bored audience of children . Below 15 , 000 feet decompression can occur , as the Handbook stipulates . Actually , it takes place at altitude , and we see the usual screaming passengers groping for their oxygen masks through the loudly swooshing escaping air stream filled with whirling papers and other debris . ( Cf . , page 251 of the handbook . ) No stereotypical incident or character is avoided . David Suchet is a fine actor but he's given lines like , " Today I free the sword of Allah and plunge it into the heart of the Infidel . " There is the inevitable pair of wire cutters poised , trembling , over the green wire or the black wire connected to the bomb . There is the lip-biting sequence in which the perspiring amateur pilot who has never soloed must land the 747 without help . The sequence was better parodied in the original " Airplane . " Suchet's stated motive must be revealed as fraudulent . He's not doing it for Allah . He's doing it for reasons of personal revenge . One must not offend any Moslems in the audience . ( Footnote , page 241 . ) I didn't mind so much the fact that this is recycled garbage . What really irked me was the presence of Steven Seagal . Every time I see him I try to remember how to spell his name and always wind up getting him mixed up with the horde of other Seagals in Hollywood - - or Siegels or Segals - - they all spell their names differently . There's even a Barbara SEAGULL . The voices tell me that this is part of a cosmic conspiracy on the part of the Seagal Meshpuchah , designed deliberately to drive me mad . And I'm inclined to believe them . The voices never lie - - although they usually trick me when it comes to the stock market . They must have their occasional pranks and I don't object to pranks if they're funny , but this movie is a prank that isn't amusing at all . If you want to see a better version of an airplane-in-jeopardy movie , watch " Airplane " instead . And if anyone insists on doing a remake of this movie - - " Executive Decision II " - - the very thought makes one blanch - - I'd like to suggest that instead of hijacking a 747 with Halle Berry as a stewardess , they just hijack Halle Berry and forget the airplane entirely . More fun for everyone involved .
443154	819382	112896	4.0	Dx : Anemia .	Mel Brooks has brought out a couple of outrageously funny movies , and Leslie Nielson has starred in his own series , but this one measures up to neither standard , alas . One of the problems is that the original " Dracula " with Bela Lugosi was so perfect in its thingness that , after only a few viewings , it's practically a self parody . In the 1930s version , Lugosi serves some drugged wine to Renfield . Renfield : " Aren't you having any ? " Dracula : " I never drink - - wine . " I doubt that the people involved in the production intended the line to be a joke , but that's what it's become . In Mel Brooks ' version , the line is repeated and the camera holds on Leslie Nielson's face , waiting for the laughs to die down . A second problem is that the gags vary from funny to silly , as is usual with Brooks , but there aren't enough of either kind . We seem to follow the 1930s version fairly closely , almost as if it were to be taken seriously . And the jokes that pad out the scenes simply aren't that amusing . In one conversation ( in " ancient Moldavian " ) both Nielson and Brooks try to get the last word in . It drags on . And in the last scene of the movie , Brooks is alone with the coffin containing the now thoroughly cremated Nielson . He glances around , slyly opens the coffin an inch , and shouts in the last word of the ancient Moldavian conversation they'd had half an hour earlier , then slams the coffin shut and strides out with a look of satisfaction . If that's the best that could be done for a climactic gag , well , there's a problem . There are other problems . Brooks is okay in the part of Van Helsin , but Leslie Nielson is a bit old for the part of Dracula , and he doesn't have the accent . ( It ought to be overblown in a movie like this . ) See George Hamilton do a better job with better lines in HIS Dracula parody , " Love At First Bite " . It's not a total waste and there are some funny moments . It's just that there aren't enough of them .
441893	819382	315297	4.0	Red Herrings in the Fog .	In some ways the best touch in this movie , efficiently directed by Philip Kaufman , comes at the climax . ( Caution : spoilers ahead ) Ashley Judd as the chief suspect is a serial murder case is forced to watch her avuncular mentor , Samuel Jackson , blow his brains out at the end of a foggy San Francisco pier and flop into the nightime water of the bay . As the sound of the shot fades , we hear the barking of distant sea lions roused from their sleep . That's just about it for the good touches , except to say that the performances are good , as we might expect from such a cast . The location shooting isn't bad either , avoiding many of the clichés found in San Francisco movies . ( No car chases down Vermont St . ) Frankly it's the plot that well and truly sucks . Ashley Judd is a decent actress but the part calls for her to be a casually and aggressively promiscuous police officer who always dresses in black , right down to her underwear . Don't get me wrong . She looks just fine in leather jackets , and in black underwear too for that matter . But she seems tiny , chubbily childlike , innocent , and this macho stuff doesn't come easily to her . And the role itself is almost an impossibility . It's one of those deals in which the investigator keeps coming up with more and more evidence that he or she is the criminal . Not too much effort is put into explaining this . Something to do with " bad blood . " And there are plenty of red herrings in San Francisco Bay . There are a couple of ex-boy friends who know all her habits and might be responsible . Then there's Andy Garcia as a potentially new boy friend . Is he killing all her ex-lovers out of jealousy ? Is it someone whom she does not know but has been studying her habits ? Is it a complete stranger ? Is it really serial suicide in which several unrelated men first torture themselves with cigarettes and then pound their own faces to a pulp with some kind of martial arts wooden instrument that looks like a dildo ? And how ABOUT those sea lions ? I've made it sound kind of silly , but that's okay because it is . I like it as much as I do because it's more of a mystery than another boring action flick . There's a bit of the old ultra violence but only one shot is fired on film and , in fact , there aren't showers of gore and exploding fireballs as somebody's car rolls off the road . I wish more effort had been put into pruning the mystery , into making it more logical , into filling in plot holes . Well - - two examples . One : Can a completely loony serial murderer turn his rage off for 15 or 20 years and then decide to turn it on again ? How does he manage to keep his job at the post office or wherever if he's so bonkers ? Why doesn't his explanation of the murders make sense ? ( That was all in the way of one example . ) Example Two : We find out that Ashley Judd couldn't have committed the murders because she'd been rendered unconscious by a drug someone put into her wine . Okay . Then how come she wakes up one morning after another victim has just been pounded to death and she finds she has a black eye and some blood on her ? How do you commit self-echymosis , especially when you're asleep ? And why does the drug turn out to be a " date-rape " drug with a long name ? And why is such emphasis placed on the fact ? Why not just a plain old safe chloral hydrate cocktail ? End of example two . I could go on but won't bother . Man , this is a muddled story . I don't know how such a talented cast and director became involved in it - - or why Veronica Cartwright is reduced to a featured bit part so small that she is uncredited . But then this movie leaves a lot of questions unanswered .
442520	819382	51522	4.0	Exceptionally Typical Western .	Fred MacMurray is the judge in a small Western town . A man named Rudy Hayes ( Christopher Dark ) has killed a farmer and been found guilty by a jury of his peers , although it's hard to imagine a peer of this unkempt miscreant . The whole town wants to see this guy hanged and MacMurray has already decided that that is what his sentence will be tomorrow . Flies in the ointment . First of all , Rudy Hayes has rather a large extended family , clearly descended from the Kallikaks or the Jukes . Two of these goons are already hanging around town , smilingly telling the judge and his assistant ( Edgar Buchanan ) and the sheriff ( John Ericson ) that if good ol ' Rudy dies , they die too . Well , says everybody , there's only the two of them . But then two or three other Hayes relatives ride into town , each meaner lookin ' than the last . Or - - let me take that back . Nobody looks meaner than Lee Van Cleef . They gang up on the sheriff and beat him . Then they rearrange MacMurray's face . They terrorize the whole town , even the victim's widow , so that everyone begins wondering if , rather than hanging the prisoner , it wouldn't be better to follow the hoodlums ' suggestion and , well , just kinda BANISH good ol ' Rudy and make him get out of the territory . Unbearable pressure is brought upon the judge to follow this path , just as pressure was brought to bear on sheriff Gary Cooper in " High Noon . " Does Fred MacMurray give in and simply banish Rudy ? Or does he sentence him to hang ? I leave it to you , the discerning and experienced watcher of Westerns , to guess . There's a second fly in the ointment . Judge MacMurray has been engaged to Joan Weldon and he plans to marry her as soon as he buys that little house . But he's a circuit judge and this takes him out of town a good deal . During one of his trips , Weldon and Ericson have fallen in love , but both are reluctant to tell MacMurray . Enough of the plot . Not so much because I'm reluctant to give any of its developments away , as that it's not genuinely worth going into in any further detail . Of the acting it can be said that this is a good , seasoned cast of Hollywood regulars - - MacMurray , Ericson , Van Cleef , Buchanan , Robert Middleton , Edward Franz , Marie Windsor - - you'll recognize a lot of faces . And in this inexpensive and somewhat tired Western , they illustrate their range . They ground out these B features like Sonicburgers in the 50s but their day was coming to an end . " Gunsmoke " was around the corner .
441991	819382	385307	4.0	Light-hearted sequel .	I can't compare it to the original , which I didn't see , but this good-natured but slightly desperate film has " sequel " written all over it . It is a mixed bag . There is the mismatched cop buddy theme , involving Sandra Bullock's antisocial and physically aggressive black partner who punches people and knocks them around . ( Ha ha . ) She and Bullock become friends by the end . There is the theme of the cop given an assignment which divides her loyalties . There is the gay sidekick who provides most of the best laughs . ( " I just LOVE Vegas , " he says , " Where else can you find a 24-hour wiggery " ? ) Lots of pratfalls . Lots of people chasing each other full tilt through hotel lobbies . Dolly Parton playing a fake playing Dolly Parton . Vegas acts with female impersonators belting out show tunes . Come to think of it , I just love Vegas too . Where else in the world ( outside of your own deranged mind ) can you find large-scale models of the Empire State Building , the Sphynx , and the Tour d'Eiffel parked next to one another , and all festooned with fluorescence and raw primary neons ? If you seek perfection you don't need Katmandu . Well - - it depends on the kind of perfection you're seeking . Sandra Bullock is okay in the role , snapping out wisecracks in the middle of muscular hi-jinks . I didn't care much for it because it seemed to me to be trying too hard to borrow from the good will generated by the successful original and because , when you get right down to it , it's not all that funny . On the other hand , if there's nothing else on and you want to be distracted for a while , this may do the job . You can just let your mind drift , your passivity interrupted by an occasional chuckle . There's a big chase scene at the end involving water .
442069	819382	64148	4.0	Peck's Not a Bad Boy	Gregory Peck does a reasonably good job as a Nobelist who is sent to China to steal an enzyme that will increase the world's food supply . The Chinese , you see , want to keep it a secret and use it themselves . ( They've since given up hoping for miracles and have turned to a much more sensible one-child per family policy . ) I guess - - legally speaking , the enzyme IS in fact a Chinese invention and belongs to them , doesn't it ? What I mean is , is it entirely ethical for Peck to sneak into China under false pretenses , swipe something of theirs , and smuggle it out of the country ? After all , when the Americans and Brits get the enzyme at the end , they too stash it away to use as a " weapon " instead of handing it over to all humankind , as Peck wants to do . It's like Clint Eastwood sneaking into the USSR and stealing the most advanced fighter airplane in the world from them ( " Firefox " ) . Problems like this don't bother the film makers . Absconding with the MacGuffin is a good idea - - period . To show how good it is , even the Russians are on our side and only the Chinese are " enemies . " And how does our side show its appreciation for Peck's life-endangering efforts ? They have planted a complex transmitter in his mastoid sinus . He has willingly allowed them to do it . What they haven't told him is that there is a coil of explosive wrapped around the chip that will blow his head off if detonated by the authorities . At the last minute , the general in charge ( Arthur Hill ) relents and doesn't explode Peck's head . That's gratitude for you . The director has tried to turn this into a light-hearted thriller , along the lines of " North by Northwest . " Accordingly , we are introduced to Chairman Mao while he's playing ping pong . And Peck is given plenty of wisecracks under stress , on top of which his performance is sort of sing-song , more animated than usual . Somehow it doesn't jell . It would have been no trouble at all in 1943 to change a few things around and have this turn out to be an anti-Nazi war film , all cloak and dagger , shadows and fog , and racing black sedans . Not one of Peck's better career choices .
442821	819382	99091	5.0	Strangers on a Pier .	I don't know . The first time I saw this , years ago , I thought it was pretty exciting but it hasn't held up well on a second viewing . It's essentially the story of Yuppie James Spader who meets the charming , but vicious and clever Rob Lowe , and is led astray by him . An office rival of Spader's plays a computer trick on him that derails his coming promotion . Spader swallows his resentment and goes to a bar in Manhattan Beach - - Los Angeles , that is . Nursing his sullenness , he is insulted and ordered to get out by some ill-mannered greaseball . He's about to comply when a stranger , Lowe , bashes the bruiser and throws HIM out . Welcome , friend . From Lowe , Spader learns not only to stand on his own two feet but to play dirty . He hijacks his office rival's computer and forces the miscreant to straighten out the kink in Spader's account . ( In " Wolf , " Spader would play the office rotter to Jack Nicholson's turning worm . ) The things get a little out of hand . Not only does Spader learn to get even with his enemies . Lowe gets him stoned and drunk and takes him out on a wildly criminal spree involving the hold up of a couple of convenience stores and the savage beating of Spader's rival . This is a turning point for Spader , as it was for Farley Granger in Hitchcock's " Strangers on a Train . " Lowe has been crashing at Spader's apartment and Spader throws him out . It doesn't work too well . Lowe is forward-looking and has amassed evidence of Spader's debauchery , including a video of Spader boffing a young lady to whom Lowe introduced him . Lowe shows up at a party at the house of Spader's fiancée and manages to have the tape played for the enjoyment of the entire family and assembled well-dressed guests . Then , as if that weren't enough , Lowe bashes in the head of Spader's young lady and spread evidence around that incriminates Spader . In fact , Lowe is constantly outwitting Spader and his brother Pismo ( a fine performance by Christian Clemenson ) . Until the end , when during a final confrontation Spader is able to capture Lowe's unwitting confession on tape . But , as Lowe would insist , it's not enough to get even , you have to demolish your enemies and Lowe winds up in the Pacific Ocean with a bullet in him . The taped confession is convenient . It absolves Spader of any guilt connected to the beating of his office rival and the murder of the young woman . But Spader had better get a phenomenally good lawyer because the residual charges are enough to send him on a long vacation to San Quentin - - participating in at least two armed robberies ; accessory before , during , and after the fact ; obstruction of justice ; illegal possession of a weapon ; and exhibiting an obscene videotape to awed and morally upright white people at a party where champagne is being served . Curtis Hanson directed . Nothing wrong with the direction , though he was to be more daring in " L . A . Confidential . " Spader is good as the Yuppie , too . He's ALWAYS been good as the Yuppie . Rob Lowe , on the other hand - - I was watching this film the first time with a mixed group and I thought Spader seemed kind of handsome in a bland , middle-American way , so I asked the women present if my impression were correct . Do women find him handsome ? " No - - the other guy . " I guess that must account for Lowe's many appearances on screen because his acting talent comes in as rather Lite . Not that he's so BAD . It's just that most of us could do just as well . Look . Let's be honest . There's nothing outstanding in any way about this film . It's entertaining , up to a point . But the theme is spelled out for us . As Lowe tells Spader , " I'm just filling all your wishes . " And the theme is much more subtly - - even masterfully - - explored in " Strangers on a Train . " Go to the original .
442721	819382	28231	5.0	Undistinguished but enjoyable thriller .	Hitchcock was professionally competent in directing this , but not yet the tantalizing genius he was to become with maturity . John Gielgud , Madeleine Carrol , and Peter Lorre are sent to Switzerland to eradicate an unknown German spy who is about to buy Arabia during World War I . First , Lorre offs the wrong man , some poor British ninny who just happens to have a German wife and has lost a suspicious button . Robert Young meanwhile has shown up as an American gadabout , flirting with Gielgud's mock wife , Carrol . The trio of assassins continues on the track of the genuine German spy , though with less zeal , now that they've thrown an innocent man off a mountaintop . The real spy turns out to be Young . In a spectacularly cheesy model train crash , Young dies after shooting Lorre , and Gielgud and Carrol are on their way to a real marriage . You wouldn't need second sight to recognize this as a Hitchcock movie but you'd have to examine it with a bit of care . There are one or two shots in which the camera dollies in for a closeup of a printed message or some other small object . The usual tourist's eye view of the location is used - - Switzerland , mountain climbing , a chocolate factory . Madeleine Carrol is a pleasant-looking blonde . And of course there is the train . Gielgud provides the stiff upper lip , inexpressive as ever , that he would later lend to his colorful character roles as butlers or whatnot . Robert Young is blandly acceptable , both as giddy suitor and sneering villain . Peter Lorre has to be seen and heard to be believed . In dark makeup and curly hair , his oily skin glistening , he speaks with an accent that is impossible to pin down , hovering somewhere between his native German and generic " Latin . " You know what Chico Marx was to vaudeville Italian ? Well that was closer to a real accent than anything Lorre comes up with here . Speaking of the Marx Brothers , Lorre has Harpo's simple approach to seducing attractive women too . When he sees one , he bares his fangs and hustles after her at a run . When irritated , he's given to tearing toilet paper off the roll and flinging it around in festoons . The film is likable in its own unpretentious way , although the DVD I watched ( part of the AH Signature Collection ) was so crummy I was unable to read more than half of the mysterious printed messages that come to Gielgud's attention .
442958	819382	35114	5.0	Okay , who's the canary ?	This is a minor motion picture . MGM has put together a fairly simple story of a good German-American who takes the place of his evil twin , who is the German Counsel and runs a spy ring . The good German ( Conrad Veidt ) worms his way into the nest of evildoers , exposes all of them , is betrayed by a pet canary , and allows himself to be taken back to Berlin for punishment in order to save his girl friend . If the plot sounds implausible , that's because it is . There are some solid supporting players ( Ray Teal , Moroni Olsen , Marc Lawrence , Martin Kosleck ) but Veidt is no one's idea of a romantic lover . Not with that pinched face and those thin lips that seem to have been painted dark , as if he were a madman who just stepped out of somebody's cabinet . He does the long-haired , bespectacled , pipe-smoking good twin adequately , but his evil twin seems much more natural . Anne Ayars speaks in a way that seems to have been endemic to women in the 1940s . There has definitely been a change in women's supersegmentals . Contemporary women are rapidly losing their vowels , so that " sure " becomes " shr " , which is actually Chinese . I've kind of made fun of the movie but I enjoyed it . It's in black and white , the score is no more than functional , and Jules Dassin has directed unpretentiously . It's not gripping so much as reassuring somehow . It's nice to contemplate a movie made during a time before movies became " films " , before there were movie critics ( except James Agee , who was a Franciscan fool ) , before movies could be entertaining without being blockbusters and costing a zillion dollars . When you watch this , you can almost smell popcorn .
443432	819382	85678	5.0	Harmless , old-fashioned comic adventure .	I'm not sure why Tom Selleck's career as a leading man stalled when it did . I'm told he's handsome . And he has that cracked Jimmy-Stewart voice . In interviews he seems bright and articulate . He doesn't do a bang-up job in this light-hearted zap number but who could ? All he's called upon to do is act drunk once in a while , and if he doesn't do as good a job as John Wayne did in " True Grit , " well , maybe it's because Wayne has had so much more practice . Oh , and Selleck is also given lines like , " Surely , the great Suleman the Exquisite would not harm a small servant of his grateful guest . " Something like that , anyway . Selleck did a fine job as Dwight D . Eisenhower in a recent TV movie - - " Ten Days to D-Day , " perhaps it was . The plot here - - self-indulgent pretty socialite hires handsome drunken pilot and his mechanic side kick to fly around most of Asia to find her missing father before she's disinherited - - is pretty familiar stuff . Runaway socialites and canny pilots . I keep thinking of Jimmy Cagney and Barbara Stanwyk lost in the desert . The photography is a bit gloomy but the locations are unusual and the action and comedy balance each other nicely . There's even a dogfight , which the slower , heavier two-seater with its single Lewis machine gun would surely have lost against the more nimble single-seater with its two machine guns . The reason the clumsier airplane wins is that it is flown by Tom Selleck , whereas the superior machine is flown by a stereotyped square-jawed blond German with no sense of humor . The music is lush and romantic . The scenery rolling . The old airplanes fun to watch as they sputter along or flop over in hammerhead stalls . The dialog sort of lumbers along in the same way , without enough funny lines or wisecracks . Still , it's not offensive in any way . The kids will probably enjoy it . Maybe they will even learn a little something about Buddhism , such as that a world religion by that name exists . Not a gem , but not bad .
442300	819382	106912	5.0	Unassuming UFO Abduction Flick .	In 1975 five guys were driving through the desolate forests of Arizona and one of them seems to have been killed or kidnapped by a giant pulsing orange UFO . The others take off and return in a hurry to town and don't report the incident . When they finally do , everyone else in the little community of Snowflake thinks that they killed Travis Walton ( D . B . Sweeney ) and left his body up there somewhere . Even the state's criminal investigator ( James Garner ) is skeptical . One or two thorough police searches of the area turn up nothing - - not the crater that the loggers claim was created by the UFO - - but no body either . Young Travis is missing for five days and nights , dressed only in denims , in the mountains where the temperature drops into the 20s ( F ) . When he turns up , he's naked , incoherent , bewhiskered , and looks slightly used . He tells his friends who , once again , delay reporting the return of the dead Walton . Later Walton , in a flashback , informs the authorities that he spent the missing time aboard a kind of space ship ( the decor of which closely resembles that of the crashed one in " Alien " ) , where he was covered by a kind of giant condom by wrinkled , pinkish crew members . The results of the polygraph tests are inconclusive , one of Walton's friends having walked out in the middle of his . ( He was hiding a criminal record . ) There has been considerable dissension among the five loggers , though the reasons are vague , and the movie ends on a note of uncertainty . The chief logger ( Robert Patrick , Agent Doggonit in " The X Files " ) and Walton visit the site of the incident a few years later . Walton has always blamed the others for leaving him behind and scurrying off . But now the two estranged friends make up , smile , and drive away from the site in peace . It doesn't really click for some reason . Except for James Garner , who is his reliable self , full of folk wisdom and common sense , the performances aren't very good , and they need to be , because the script wanders around from here to there , sometimes passing beyond implausible into positively dubious . Must ALL the townspeople glare at Patrick and the others - - in the café ? At the town hall meeting in the church ? And the film has surprisingly little in the way of sense of place , of local color . There is no vastness in this vast wilderness . The interiors of the working-class homes look like generic working-class " homes " . And the script is so weak it leaves us in doubt about what's going on with the polygraph tests . The dialog , even when delivered believably , lacks sparkle and tag lines . On the other hand , a lot of effort evidently went into Walton's experiences aboard the space ship . I don't know whether " Alien " ( 1979 ) was such a good influence on space ships or not . Before " Alien " all space ships were shiny , metallic , high-tech , impeccably clean and full of right angles . Since " Alien " they all look like something cobbled together out of Play-Do by a demented five-year-old kid , then poked full of holes , and squirted with organic honey . And why all this stuff about the horrifying experience anyway ? Val Lewton discovered that sometimes the scariest things of all are those that you don't see . They'd have been better off throwing that money into the script and the cast and coming up with an effective psychological drama and mystery . I can see a neat little film coming out of it . As it is , we're more or less forced into going along with Travis Walton's spectacular story , unless the detailed flashback is lying , as well as the five loggers . Were Walton and the others pulling a hoax for whatever reason ? Who knows . Walton must have made some money out of it - - he wrote a detailed book about the event and he's co-writer on this movie . That doesn't mean it didn't happen , of course . There is simply too much evidence from credible people that SOMETHING is going on , something entirely non-paradigmatic , and we don't have the slightest idea what it is . It's a stretch to think that aliens are behind it , but if they are , I have a suggestion for our extra-terrestrial visitors . Next time you decide to pluck somebody up and take him for a long ride into outer space , don't choose some redneck nobodies in boots and cowboy hats , with names like Lamar Oakum and Dwight ( " Big Bobbie " ) Thumm . Drop in on Washington , DC , and make off with a politician . Take your pick . Keep him as long as you like .
442470	819382	47679	5.0	Why Won't They Believe Me !	Stanwyck is a painter who spots a murder taking place across the courtyard of her high rise . The murderer is the suave George Sanders , a distinguished historian and author . She calls the police , in the person of Gary Merrill , but do you think Merrill and his boys believe her ? Not for a moment . They go so far as to examine Sanders ' apartment and car without finding " a scrap of evidence . " I found this startling . The proper metric for " evidence " is not " the scrap . " I was able to exhale with relief half an hour later when Merrill reverted to the more appropriate measurement , the " shred " of evidence . Whew . A close call . For a moment the script had taken on the sheen of originality . Sanders , who is of course a real murderer , is the soul of civility and reason with the authorities . But Stanwyck becomes more and more alarmed . Sanders introduces the notion of her being mentally ill , so he begins to doubt her own sanity . And , at night , Sanders creeps into her apartment and types threatening notes to himself on HER typewriter . He presents the notes to the police , most reluctantly , but , after all , his life may be in danger from this deranged woman with the idee fixe . When she ' brought in and confronted the the notes , she can't remember writing them . ( Because she DIDN'T write them . ) Gary Merrill has come to like her but must now stand aside as the Captain , Ray Shannon , decides to send her to a mental hospital for observation . He has no authority to do that , by the way , at least not anymore . She has a fit of gibbering hysterics at the police station . At the hospital she's interviewed by hostile shrinks and must live with stereotyped kooks . There are more troubles until , finally , she visits Sanders in his apartment and he tells her the truth . Yes , of course he killed that tart . What good was she to anyone ? He himself was bored with her . To top it off , he begins to shout epigrams about " when the time comes " - - in German . ( The writers have not forgotten or forgiven World War II . ) Sanders tries to throw her out the window . He's already typed her suicide note on her typewriter . The police having stumbled upon evidence linking Sanders to the murder victim , show up just as Stanwyck is escaping the apartment . She runs off down the city streets , followed by Sanders and , behind him , Merrill and a dozen cops . Stanwyck pauses once in a while to grab a stranger by the lapels and scream , " Help me ! They're trying to kill me ! " She climbs to the top of a tall building being constructed , with the murderous Sanders in hot pursuit . I won't spell out the details of the climax except to say that it is not a tragic ending . Stanwyck is okay , a little more animated perhaps than in some of the other films she made around this time . Merrill is professional and has a reassuring baritone . Sanders is his usual impeccable cad self in most scenes but I wish he could have avoided that Nazi rant and losing his cool during a fist fight at the end . He's not the type . I don't know why this film is interpreted as some sort of product of a patriarchal society . The helpless witness to a murder is a cliché , but it's not gender specific . Jimmy Stewart was in the same boat in " Rear Window . " He couldn't convince the police either . ( There weren't enough shreds of evidence . ) And the scene in which the oleaginous villain sounds perfectly reasonable while the innocent accused goes all to pieces and starts screaming with indecipherable rage isn't gender specific either . Jack Lemon went to pieces at a critical moment in " The China Syndrome . " And Mathew Modine went berserk trying to explain things to the police in " Pacific Heights . " It's a well-established cliché . On the other hand , there is a general tendency for women to be portrayed as helpless victims whom no one believes . Call it " the suffering victim " fantasy . The LMN network is full of movies with titles like , " Please Don't Take My Baby . " The corresponding male fantasy is that of the conquering hero . Pick any film on the Action Network for an example . " Rambo : First Blood " is a good one to start with . It has to be that way . It's Nature's design . Can you imagine Arnold Schwarzenegger having witnessed a murder and no one believing him and his being sent to a mental hospital and threatened with defenestration by George Sanders ?
441625	819382	106918	5.0	Nice performances , clotted plot	You really can't fault any of the performers here . Tom Cruise has a boyish high-school handsomeness and an unthinkingly naive demeanor to go with it . Jeanne Triplehorn has big dark soulful eyes and does and says what she's supposed to . But the lesser actors are the more interesting . And they are here in droves . Gene Hackman , the late What's-his-name Viterelli ( I can only think of him as " Jelly " in " Analyze This " ) , Holly Hunter looking sexy and sassy , a hypomanic Gary Busey who , when capable of it , really delivers , Paul Sorvino who underplays ( honest ) , Hal Holbrook and Wilfred Brimley being nasty , poor Tobin Bell as the albino who must have played a dozen hit men and mass murderers by now , Ed Harris now with a completely shaved head , Terry Kinney as the pale blond nice guy who conceals his demons , and Steven Hill as a ruthless FBI man . The performances and the locations make this worth a dekko . This ought to be Sidney Pollack's turf alright - - corruption in a law firm and illegal activities by the authorities , the kind of polluted panorama that he often finds appealing . But somehow it doesn't come off . I haven't read John Grisham's book but it's hard to believe the plot could be as complicated as this movie . There were times when I was completely lost , especially towards the end when the firm begins to unravel and the chases and breathless phone calls start . Probably the most interesting character's is Gene Hackman's crooked but very human lawyer . His scenes with Tripplehorn are really quite good , his hesitations , awkward silences , embarrassed chuckles , and vapid smiles . His last scene with her , as he lies half drugged in bed , is outstanding . The ending is hard to swallow . Cruise gives the Feds just enough legal information to put the bad guys away for several years , based on the fact that the firm overbilled its clients and used the post office to do it , which is a federal offense . A clever move on the part of Cruise but I had a hard time visualizing these murdering wealthy perps doing any jail time . I mean , for what ? For sending a client a bill that charged too much ? That would put my plumber in jail , my doctor , my shrink , and a strange porno web site that I once unwittingly subscribed to - - but these guys ? Nope . Even if they were convicted , I see Dershowitz handling the appeal
442616	819382	120787	5.0	A Regular Sheepshank	SPOILERS . It's hard to imagine why they keep remaking classics , aside from the desire to make more money . Frederick Knott's mystery can be played a number of different ways . A TV production some years ago used Anthony Quayle , a splendid actor , as Chief Inspector Hubbard . It followed the script precisely and was dull . This version is updated , more explicit , and more complicated , a sheepshank compared to the original square Knott , and not only isn't an improvement over the play but is well below the standard set by Hitchcock's rendition in 1954 . Hitchcock only made the film because he'd had several flops in a row and needed something safe , something that had already proved its popularity , in order to " recharge the batteries " as he put it . He may have chosen it out of desperation but it is suffused with his idiosyncratic brand of irony , humor , and technique . Who could take Ray Milland as the roguish would-be killer Tony Wendice seriously ? He belongs up there in the pantheon of Hitchcock's villains along with James Mason in " North by Northwest . " Here we have the play spread out over several locations , more violence and blood , and Gywneth Paltrow taking a bath - - none of which really helps much . How can they botch up such a tightly bound plot ? By loosening it , introducing irrelevancies , losing the focus on the misplaced key , throwing in simulated sex , and reducing suspense while increasing the movement of the actors . As the head villain , Michael Douglas plays it dead seriously . He broods a lot . His occasional muted laughter is barren , his smiles as phony as they come . He may be rich as hell but he never seems to be having a good time . Of course it doesn't help when your wife is being boffed by some other guy , even if you don't care much for her . Vigo Mortenson , as the boffer , is the auxiliary heavy , and I suppose looks kind of sexy in a greasy , long-haired , unkempt sort of way , the kind of Byronic figure who cares for nothing except his art and the satisfaction of his sensual appetites , which may appeal to women who enjoy being invited to tame this brutishness , the kind of women who enjoy riding slightly spirited stallions . That's the way the part is written anyway . But Mortenson doesn't deliver on the " fine madness " business . His strong face is almost without expression and his voice close to toneless . He comes across as the con man he really is , underneath that painter's smock . Gwyneth Paltrow is the boffee . Her face is beautiful , architecturally structured . It seems all odd angles and large , queerly slanted blue eyes . Her appeal is a bit goofy , too , rather like her mother's , Blythe Danner's , but very real . Her bony frame under those chic outfits lends her image a gawky elegance . She looks inexperienced , vulnerable , easily exploited , manipulable . If she were a greeting card and you opened her up , she would read , " I'm so sorry . " I won't go into the plot details much except to say that the characters of Mark Halliday and Lesgatt / Swan are combined into one . Losing the key is a killer mistake as far as the narrative is concerned and it can't be made up for by giving additional screen time to big-name Hollywood stars . The direction is plodding , I'm afraid . The most gripping scene in Hitchcock's " Dial M for Murder " is when Grace Kelly answers the phone and keeps asking who is on the other end , while the killer , having appeared from nowhere , is standing in the shadow behind her , poised with a startlingly white scarf , waiting for Kelly to replace the phone so he can get it around her neck . The attempted murder is horrifying . It ends with Kelly grabbing a pair of scissors ( the presence of which , in that particular place , has been carefully but offhandedly explained earlier ) and stabbing the killer . The same scene here is more violent . The director shows us Paltrow being thrown all over the place , sliding on a butcher-block table with her robe flying open so we can get a glimpse of her bare legs ( she just got out of the bath ) , dishes smashing , pots being bonged against each other on the ceiling rack . Paltrow grabs a knife - - and here it comes - - but no . The killer manages to disarm her even while strangling her . ( Insert further description of plates falling , pans clanging , women screaming , Alaska being drilled for oil , a Keystone Kop falling off a cliff , a rotating kaleidoscope , a merry-go-round with the horses riding the children , a heroin addict trying to insert a suppository , and so forth . ) Finally , having run out of ideas , the writers have Paltrow fumble for a gratuitous - - get this - - meat thermometer and plunge it into the guy's neck so that blood shoots out of his carotid artery like a fireman's hose gone berserk . There's gore all over the place . The body seems to lie in gallons of it . There are bloody footprints along the floor , smeared hand prints on the wall , all the way from the kitchen to the bedroom where an incarnadined Paltrow winds up shivering . Maybe it's unfair to compare this murder scene to the way Hitchcock filmed it , but , really , bad taste is bad taste . Well , let's leave the corpse alone . You want to see an enjoyable version of this play ? Try " Dial M for Murder . "
443350	819382	37193	5.0	Frenetic Hope Comedy .	This is a splashy Technicolor comedy with Bob Hope as an impersonator on the run , Virginia Mayo as a kidnapped princess , Victor McLaglan as " The Hook " , and Walter Slezak as the ruler of an island that serves as a pirate's rest stop . It should be funnier than it is , and I was trying to figure out why it doesn't come off more satisfactorily than it does . It's certainly fast enough . Everyone seems to be running around , bellowing , and there are explosions and multiple sword fights , and a few minutes of romance . But it's not funny for the same reason that " Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd " isn't funny anymore . It's a child's idea of comedy in that it lacks any sophistication . I don't mean to be supercilious but kids laugh at things that don't demand much of them . Somebody takes a pratfall and a fifth-grader laughs . Kids don't need to know anything other than what they see happening on the screen . What made the Road movies so funny was that there were pauses so that the audience could take a breath while Bing Crosby crooned a silly tune to Dorothy Lamour . And Hope and Crosby were constantly trying to outwit each other in ways both shameless and sly . When they had a friendly embrace and picked each other's pockets at the same time , we could identify with them , or at least with their desires . There was somebody for a grown up to ROOT for on the screen . The Road team had a different set of writers - - Panama and Frank - - and they were better at giving Hope gags than the writers of " The Princess and the Pirate . " Hope is given a couple of anachronistic wisecracks - - " made in Japan , eh ? " - - but they don't save the day because the rest of the movie propels us at warp speed through the ludicrous plot . One of the more amusing scenes is a minor rip-off from the Marx Brothers ' " Duck Soup . " What's missing is the easy banter between Hope and Crosby , the more delicate touches provided for them . ( " Delicate " , here , being a relative term . ) Hope on his own could be hilarious , as he was in " They Got Me Covered . " Danny Kaye was making movies in this period that were just as funny and , like Hope , he always played the same character , but it was a different character : the shy , neurotic schlub . Hope always played the same part in the 1940s too - - the sniveling , greedy , libidinous coward - - but nobody was better at it . Woody Allen borrowed some of Hope's mannerisms for his own performances . If you give Hope the right settings and the right gags he runs with the ball like nobody's business . But this part could have been done by almost any comic actor , maybe Red Skelton . " The Princess and the Pirate " was released in 1944 . Hope had some splendid movies ahead of him . In the 1960s he was churning out one turkey after another . I suppose he must have enjoyed working . He surely didn't need the money by then . When he finally quit , he played golf , continued to make his well-known USO tours to troops overseas , and lived to a respectably old age . Not at all a bad career .
443139	819382	422295	5.0	Alice in Wonderland .	This is a love story . That it happens to be based on an interpretation of Diane Arbus ' life is supervenient . This could be any young woman from an artistic but conventional background living in Greenwich Village in 1958 . Or it could be Alice in Wonderland . When Nicole Kidman , as Arbus , first enters Lionel Sweeney's ( Robert Downey's ) apartment upstairs , she can't find him in the colored shadows but when a teapot whistles she finds a note next to it . " Pour the boiling water into the tea cup . Let it steep . Drink it . " It might as well be Alice's little bottle that is labeled " Drink me . " Anyway , that visit introduces Kidman to a world quite different from the one she's used to . Downey is covered with more hair than Lawrence Talbot whom he , in fact , resembles . In some ways it works to his advantage . All we can see of him , his tresses aside , are his dark liquid eyes , and all we hear is his deep , sonorous , mysterious , monotonic voice . He tells her what to do , in detail . " Take off your slippers . " " Close your eyes and don't turn around . " " Disrobe . " At that point I would already be out of there . It wouldn't be because he's Jo-Jo the Dog Faced Boy but because I don't like being ordered around - - except by particular women at a time and place of my own choosing . Downey begins to take her around town to meet his friends . While traveling in public , Downey wears a hood something like the elephant man's . Yet it serves more to call attention to him than to deflect it , because the hood is clumsily made of white cloth and crudely stitched with horrifyingly over-sized black thread . The hood screams , " Look at ME . " But Kidman is no stranger to the moral power of victimhood and she knows how to use it . When Downey first addresses her as " Dye-anne " she quickly corrects him , " Actually it's ' Dee-onne ' . " She's probably been correcting other people all her life and may have gotten to enjoy it , otherwise why not let the solecism glide a time or two , or soften the correction somehow , maybe something like , " My friends pronounce it ' Dee-onne ' . " Imagine if the man we know as Mario Cuomo abruptly began demanding that people call him " Mah-rio " , as in Italy . He could be the equivalent of Leonard Bernstein who used to really chew people out for saying Bern-steen when he insisted on Bern-stine . Or was it the other way round ? I forget . Where was I before I was overcome by these sociological insights . Yes , " fur . " That's right . Thank you . It's an extremely and consciously artistic movie and it's atmosphere is stunning , as is Nicole Kidman . The problem is that it falls into an all-too-familiar trap . The victims ( in this case the human anomalies ) are good and the ordinary people are not so good . Kidman's husband , the holotypical normal , is distant , humorless , and rather dull . In actual life he couldn't have been quite that inexpressive since he at least grew a beard which , in 1958 , was still an object of public comment . But when Kidman invites her new friends in for dinner , he can't stand them and walks out . Kidman's parents are presented as a pair of prunes . The anomalies , on the other hand , may be a bit shocking to look at or to watch . I mean , there's the otherwise limbless woman who does everything from eating to painting with one foot . But , heck , they're a lot of fun too . They have parties together , listen to jazz , drink , laugh , and smoke dope . The climactic scene has Kidman shaving the ape man - - all over . He comes out looking remarkably like Robert Downey , Jr . After that they make love , and after that he takes a last swim out to see . And Diane - - that's Dee-onne - - Arbus wasn't far behind him . The movie generates a good deal of pathos but it suffers from the stereotyping of its characters . It would have been nice to have just one mean dwarf . Or if the anomalies had just one other normal-looking friend . However , the introduction of even that small amount of ambiguity might have undercut the sympathy and the tears that the movie works so hard to jerk .
442950	819382	56931	5.0	A puzzle wrapped in an enigma and so forth .	Unlike the original , " Village of the Damned , " this film skips the introductory stuff and begins in medias res , with the kids already six or seven years old , half a dozen of them , spread around the world in different countries . There is no explanation of how they were born except in the claim of an English mother that she'd " never been touched . " In principle , that's okay . But in this instance it means there is no dramatic introduction that's the equivalent of those disquieting first scenes in the original , in which Midwitch is shrouded in some kind of invisible cloud that renders people unconscious the moment they enter it . What I mean is that there isn't a lot of mystery in most of this movie . We see the kids drawn together in London . They hardly speak . Some of them never utter a word . And they hole up with their pretty , blond adult servant in a dilapidated church , resisting all efforts to get them to return to their normal lives . Why are they there ? ( Or , let's say , why are they here ? ) We don't know . They don't know either . They manage to share thoughts with one another without speaking . They put together some solar-powered machine that blows the minds of anyone approaching them with even the slightest of hostile intents . And they don't hesitate to kill people who try to exploit them . They're both sinister and lethal . And nobody knows their goal . There is a big argument among the military and the scientists about whether they should be destroyed or not , and one of the children is shot dead during a killing spree . Finally , the community deems them too dangerous to survive and brings to bear enormous ordinance to exterminate them and clobber the deconsecrated church they've barricaded themselves in . There's a lot of rather obvious Cold War intrigue going on . Every nation wants to take its own superchild and put its brain to use . ( For a surreal example of this theme , read John Hersey's novel , " The Child Buyer . " ) The Cold War material is right up front , but when that dilapidated church first appeared I wondered whether religion were behind the story . It was . The child who was killed is brought back to life . And the children stand hand in hand while they're martyred . I won't get into too detailed an explanation of exactly HOW religion fits in because , mainly , I can't . I didn't understand the thing . The narrative seemed to be going in a direction similar to that of " The Day the Earth Stood Still . " I am sacrificing my life to convince you that you should stop your bickering . And yet , if that is in fact the message , it comes across as if written in proto-Indo-Hittite . What's left at the end resembles the cloud of dust that settles over the now-demolished church . I'd like to be able to recommend it more highly but it's left me as confused as the screenplay . I think , if I hadn't a clearer idea of what I was aiming for , I'd have left the original alone .
443129	819382	109458	5.0	Episode in Later Series Meets With Modest Success	Colombo solves this murder by figuring out that a call could not have been made from a cell phone in the mountains behind Malibu . Falk still has some dash , but the writers have slowed his intellect more than usual . He's not familiar with satellite dishes and television . He's only " heard about dem things . " And he's not so sure about cellular phones either . " Dey give you tumors . " Colombo , however , is savvy enough to stage a bicycling accident on a rural road in order to trip up the killer . Colombo is a constant in these movies . His character never changes . If he's more amusing in some episodes than in others it's because he's sometimes given better lines . ( My favorite , from another episode involving Janet Leigh , is " cadaveric spasm ? ! " ) But if the villain is dull , so is the story . And Colombo's murderers come generally in two categories : the flamboyant and the icy cold . My vote for best icy murderer : Patrick McGoohan , the Colonel in charge of the military college . Here , William Shatner makes a pretty effective flamboyant murderer , hammy to the point of outrageousness . Some actors coast along on their normal off-screen personalities , but Shatner gives it everything he's got , huffing and puffing , the theatrical contours of his voice taking us on a roller coaster ride , sneering and strutting and superior and entirely unbelievable . He seems to be having a hell of a good time , barely able to keep from laughing out loud . Maybe it's partly because he regularly checked his appearance in a mirror and found that his mustache couldn't make up its mind about its color . Still it's a bit sluggish . I guess that in order to make the story and the flagging energy behind the series seem a little more contemporaneous , the writers have brought in an openly gay love affair and a hint of incestuous feelings . Neither is particularly interesting , nor are they relevant to the plot . And I have no idea what the title means : " Butterfly in Shades of Grey . " Did I miss something ? The plot is somewhat hard to follow at times too . A Senator is destroyed , somehow , on the air for no special reason and some minutes are spent on this incident . Enjoyable though . If not among the best , it's not among the worst either .
442857	819382	435705	5.0	Leaves You Numb .	An action movie with a gimmick . Nicholas Cage is a Las Vegas illusionist who actually has the power to see into the future - - but only insofar as the events are connected with his own body sheath . He can tell , for instance , if he's about to be hit by a car while crossing the street , and thus avoid it , but he can't tell if somebody else a block away is about to be run over . A gang of international terrorists has smuggled a nuclear device into the United States and is going to demolish a city . The FBI , chiefly in the rather attractive form of the no-nonsense agent in charge , Julianne Moore , once they find out , are naturally enough interested in enlisting the help of Cage . He's reluctant , for reasons having to do with adding some tension to the plot , but finally agrees after the FBI track him down , capture him , and convince him of his misperception of the circumstances . Oh - - and Jessica Biel is thrown into the mix to provide Cage with a threatened girl friend and a bit of sex . The movie is directed at a frenetic pace . The music pounds us into insensibility . The action is speeded up and the camera revolves around Cage's figure like a manic merry-go-round . But all this is to be expected in an action movie designed to hold your breath until you feel dizzy . We get to know virtually nothing about the dozen or so young terrorists , male and female , who want to destroy us . None has a dog or a stamp collection . I keep thinking of how Hitchcock handled villains . Hitchcock's villains , even in his most patriotic and simple-minded films , were always interesting and highly individuated . The polite Nazis in " Saboteur " and James Mason's suave heavy in " North by Northwest . " These guys are just devoted nihilists , no more than that . The only thing of interest about them is the language they speak . This varies from one dumb action movie to another , and it's always revealing to follow their evolution in Hollywood scripts . For years after World War II , they spoke German . During the Cold War they became Russians . After the collapse of the USSR they morphed into Spanish-speaking cocaine drug lords from " the cartel . " More recently , they've begun speaking Arabic and looking vaguely Middle Eastern . ( Sometimes there were retrograde dips : the gang of thugs in " Die Hard " spoke German with Russian accents . ) This particular gang speaks three languages . English - - but with a British accent - - German , and French . The first two are traditional in the genre . But French ? When did they become terrorists , and how do you say " freedom fries " in French ? In any case , whatever language they happen to be speaking , with whatever accents , they are dismissable except as plot engines , their animus driving the story along at breakneck speed . Fast , yes , but confusing too . Cage is leading the FBI agents through one of those warehouses with lots of catwalks and plumes of steam . He can tell when a sniper is around the corner by imagining himself turning the corner and being shot . But then , with no fanfare , he goes overboard and begins purposefully imagining himself turning both right AND left at the same time , to see what will happen to him in either case . Soon enough , he is morphing in his mind into three or four Nicolas Cages striding off in different directions , and each of these splits again into three or four . By the end of this sequence there are more than a dozen Cages scurrying around in this warehouse , each independent of the other , and each representing a possible future that the ORIGINAL Cage , half a mile back there , is imagining . And - - are you keeping this straight ? Because there were times when to me they began to make the same impression as a horde of cockroaches scurrying away from a fruitcake . This movie is not the type that will deny the viewer the catharsis of a nuclear explosion that demolishes Los Angeles and kills all the principles , so don't worry about that . However , after we have the satisfaction of viewing the cataclysm , the camera takes us back to Cage lying in bed beside his girl friend . It's all been in his mind . ( Whew . ) He immediately contacts Moore and tells her he's made a mistake . They have to adopt a different approach because once you change the future , that changes everything . I suppose this is his version of " the grandfather paradox " of time travel . If you go back into the past and murder your own grandfather before he has had a chance to reproduce , how can you exist ? But does it apply to the future ? The answer isn't self evident , and the whole thing is dismissed with Cage's offhand dictum . It's the last line in the movie , and it's a cop out . But then the whole movie is nothing more than a high-concept cop out . I kind of enjoyed seeing it - - once . I often enjoy action movies . They aren't high art . They're not the Guggenheim Museum or the Brooklyn Bridge . They're vernacular art , like a colorful and ergonomic gas station . We need both , but " Next " is more like some sprawling wooden shack all by itself at a dusty crossroads , with decrepit gas pumps in front and a sign , " Red's Pit Stop and Car Wash . " But there's a cardboard sign tacked to the door , " Closed Due to Exhaustion . " I think at this point I should either quit or ask the waitress for a fresh analogy .
441826	819382	104502	5.0	Pedantic and sketchy police story .	The sociologist Robert E . Park wrote in the 1920s about marginal people , by which he meant individuals stuck between two statuses , neither fish nor fowl , unable to identify with either . His analysis focused on roles that stood in some shady area between " management " and " labor . " As examples he used white-collar workers and factory foremen . According to this movie , which is " based on a true story " , he could have included police detectives on NYPD who were opposed to the death penalty . The story is set in 1968 and illustrates the two attitudinal poles . It begins by showing us the takeover by students of Columbia University in New York . Then , immediately after Detective Mitchell wins a decoration from the department , it shows him turning down what amounts to an order from a public relations officer to broadcast a message in favor of New York's death penalty , which was then under review . Boy , is this guy marginal . His fellow officers do everything but spit on him , even after he heroically brings down the killer of a brother officer . His family , his friends , the DA's office , all turn against him . He could be Frank Serpico . One wonders whether that critically and commercially successful earlier film was in the minds of the people who greenlighted this rather sketchy and overdone tale . The film has the feeling of having been rushed through production . The acting is perfunctory . The locations unevocative . The moral lesson is that we should all do our jobs and tell the truth and justice , as the community defines it , will out . That's what Detective Mitchell says on the witness stand during a critical scene at the end . Of course we've heard it before , only it usually comes at us as , " I'm a soldier , not a politician . " The movie is stacked against the death penalty , not so much by any logical or ethical argument , as by direction . Mitchell has a couple of nightmares of people being electrocuted and wakes up gasping for breath . Everyone who counsels him in favor of execution seems either grasping or mentally stunted . Fortunately we are spared scenes of the victims actually being electrocuted , which have come to be practically de rigeur since they seem to satisfy some morbid sentiments in some of the audience members , those who can't pass a highway accident without hoping for a glimpse of the mangled body . I found the film preachy and not well executed though , for what it's worth , I would endorse its message .
442990	819382	340919	5.0	Loose-limbed , ambitious thriller .	Basically a chase thriller in which an experienced hit man working for an unnamed government agency ( Scott Glenn ) takes personal revenge on a former friend , irritating his employers and prompting them to send a team of two other hit men ( including Harvey Keitel ) to rub him out . But the wily Glenn takes two hostages ( Craig Wasson and Giovanna Zacarias ) and leads the pursuing pair on a merry chase along " the highways and by-ways of this dysentery factory . " In the end , the unnamed government agency is satisfied that Glenn is offed and the incident closed . In reality , Glenn and Zacarias have fallen for one another , made a successful escape , and are living a happy life in a mountain cabin . The fact that the government agency is unnamed should give you a hint about what kind of story this is . It's one that won't step on anybody's toes , including the CIA and Mexican law enforcement agents . The story as sketched in above is really rather skeletal , I know , but there's not really that much more to the plot . The performances vary a lot in their quality . Scott Glenn is his taciturn icy self , his face and torso more etched with experience than ever . Giovanna Zacarias is by no means beautiful in any ordinary sense , yet her character is intelligent , empathic , and proud . She has strong features and glistening black eyes and although she may have been a whore ( " the woman of desperation " ) she might just be the kind of puta you would think about taking home to Mamma . Keitel combines being laid back with being as tense as an unsprung jack-in-the-box . Craig Wasson sounds like Albert Brooke and looks a little like him . He does not deliver anything I could detect as a believable line . If you are being kept captive by a CIA hit man and wanted to sneak away , would YOU constantly argue with him and your girl friend ? Would you shout at him in a public restaurant ? In other words , would you do everything you possibly could to make him keep his eye on you ? That's not entirely Wasson's fault . He can only say what the script orders him to , and the script doesn't really give anyone too much to work with . The betrayed hero of Vietnam is already a cliché , with his flashbacks and bitterness leading him into violence . In the course of the film , he is humanized by Zacarias ( " Luz " , great name ) . And once she understands the source of his torment she undergoes a kind of Mazatlan Syndrome and bonds with him . There's something else that creeps into the story , or tries to , from time to time . There's religious imagery all over the place . And there's a good deal of talk about God and forgiveness . It simply doesn't hang together though . ( The novel might have dealt with these questions a little more effectively . ) The last time Glenn prayed was when he was being tortured by the Vietnamese , and he prayed for death . When God didn't answer , he gave up on God and believes God now reciprocates . Well , Luz still believes in forgiveness and she must have been right because that mountain cabin at the end is sure idyllic .
443141	819382	24484	5.0	Mildly Diverting Comedy .	It's the depression and everyone is hard up except the very wealthy . ( Plus ca change . . . ) Ginger Rogers is a working girl forced to share an attic or loft with Norman Foster , an artist who refuses to take any money from the society matron ( Laura Hope Crews ) who pursues him . George Sidney is Mr . Eckbaum , the slightly frantic landlord who tries to keep everything going . He arranges it so that Rogers , who is a telephone salesgirl by day , and Foster , who has a job as a night watchman , never meet . Trying to keep the place " respectable , " you know . Well , the two roomies who don't know each other take a long time to meet . In the meantime , leaving nasty notes for one another and playing painful pranks , each comes to loathe the other . But - - guess what ! - - they meet accidentally outside their attic , assume false identities for different reasons , and fall for each other . This plot , I'm sure , goes back farther than " You've Got Mail " or " The Shop Around the Corner . " I honestly don't know how far back in the mists of ancient history it goes . When did they invent rentals ? It's a bit slow at first . George Sidney is funny , though , as the wisecracking Jewish landlord . His son Julius brings him a bowl of noodle soup for the famished Rogers but spills some on the carpet . " Ahh , next time I ask you for TWO bowls of zoop - - one for the lady and one for the carpet . " If you don't think that's funny , I ought to warn you that that's about as good as it gets . Robert Benchley is in it too , as the amorous boss of Rogers at the Icy Air Refrigerator Company , but his particularly Ivy League brand of humor may be an acquired taste . Except for " Foreign Correspondent , " come to think of it , where his non sequiturs were superb . Guinn ( Big Boy ) Williams also appears in the small role of a comic taxi driver . Foster isn't much of an actor but Ginger Rogers is delightfully piquant as a tough but vulnerable proletarian . She has a wonderful figure , which she gets to display , but her movements are stiff and no one could have predicted that within the next few years she would be a partner in the most famous dancing team in the world . Everything about the movie is smooth and logical and never rises above the level of " nice " - - slightly amusing , slightly warm , and with a happy ending .
442281	819382	62883	5.0	The Detective as non-Cartesian	Lee Remick , with fluffy hair and overactive glands , tells separated hubby Frank that she wishes they could get together again . She doesn't know why not . " We know the reasons , Karen , but understanding's not enough , is it ? " It's not what you think that counts , it's how you act . Boy , this movie is pretty dated . The local gays are rounded up like cattle and shoved around , sometimes brutally . This generally doesn't happen anymore . Not that the NYPD has become more tolerant ; it's just that they don't care so much . Homosexuality here is treated as " the love that dare not speak its name . " ( Now it's become the love that sometimes can't seem to shut up . ) I've never understood the nature of Sinatra's appeal . He doesn't seem the least bit handsome to me , and his voice deteriorated badly after his late 1950s hits . But he has turned in a few good performances , " From Here to Eternity , " " The Manchurian Candidate , " " Suddenly , " and this one . He's not bad . He brings a lot of autobiographical stuff to the part . " I'll give you a rap in the mouth " was a common expression in the urban corridor of New Jersey when he was growing up in Hoboken . My old man used to say it all the time . The other performances are okay too . Interesting to see Duval in an early role . And Loyd Bochner is his usual , smooth , hair-slicked-back overwhelmingly Hollywoodian handsome self . ( But the cinematography is pretty low . All gloomy blues and greens , like " Madigan , " or maybe it was just the film itself . ) The director has a bad habit . He has the characters speak their lines to one another while looking directly into the camera . ( Damn Godard ! ) I don't know what he expected to accomplish by overusing this technique . I don't feel more " involved " with the characters or with the story . When Lee Remick stares at me from the screen , her lips aquiver , and tells me some secret , I just think that she must be uncomfortable talking to a machine . And when old blue eyes stares at me in close up and tries to give me a big smile , it is I who feel uncomfortable ! ( The technique might work quite well in some interactive skin flick . ) Detective Leland is not an uninteresting character . It must have been a revelation in 1968 that a cop could know anything about playwrights like Shaw and O'Casey . But we've learned that lesson by now , what with Serpico and the ballet and all . Also , like Serpico , we have a cop here who is guided by very strict ethical values . This is a guy who knows right from wrong , and who believes in personal responsibility , a moral paragon . He has some interesting exchanges with Bochner , the doc , toward the end , when he discovers that he , Frank , is responsible for the death of an innocent man , and not for innocent reasons either . The Doc ( Frank hates shrinks ) tries to relieve him of his guilt , but Frank is not to be had so easily . He sees through the Doc's ploy and takes responsibility for his own acts , as the pop psychologists used to say . It isn't what you think , it's how you behave that counts . There is a subplot involving some organization called " Rainbow . " The leaders of the borough all belong to it . What they do is buy up property and sell it to each other . Then when the price is high enough , they put on their borough-leader hats and buy it from themselves as property for a hospital or whatever , at a profit . " Once that's done with , " says Frank , " there isn't enough money left to build a birdhouse . " I don't get this , not having an MBA or anything . Where is Sir John Templeton when we need him . At times Frank sounds not only like a drama critic but a positive liberal as well - - " We're sitting on the lid of the garbage cans ( ie . , the ghetto ) and when that lid blows off . . . . . " Even after the obligatory resignation from the force , he is mumbling about doing some sort of social good , but it doesn't sound too convincing . When I was growing up , the local police weren't what most normal people would call liberal . I was clubbed around for throwing a snowball into an empty parking lot . I've seen guys who were kind of drunk in public get pounced on by a dozen men in blue and literally get their teeth pounded out . ( The guy was so drunk , he got up from the cement , said , " Hey bobareebop , somebody got his teeth knocked out , " and he spit them out of his bloody mouth all over the pavement where they bounced about like navy beans . ) You know what ? In any real urban police force in this country , I'd give Frank two minutes before he's out of a job permanently . Know what's striking about this film ? Sinatra plays the Montgomery Clift part in " From Here to Eternity " - - the hard-headed loner , the best man at his job , with his own sense of honor who will not bend his principles to become a success in the organization he loves .
442036	819382	43129	5.0	Modest Comedy From Ford .	You have to keep your eyes open to see John Ford as a motivating force behind this slender but still successful comedy . If it weren't for the rituals - - civil and military - - and the booze , well , it would be hard to tell . Dan Dailey is the first man from Punxatawy , West Virginia , to enlist after Pearl Harbor but his boyish thirst for action goes unslaked when he is posted as a gunnery instructor at a local airfield . Two years pass , during which the townspeople who were so proud of him become used to his always hanging around while the war goes on elsewhere . ( Some hero . ) Despite his insistence , the Air Force will not give him combat duty . Instead he collects stripes and good conduct medals at home . His father , William Demarest , is frankly irritated with him . Suddenly Dailey is assigned to a B-17 bound for England , as a last-minute replacement for a crew member . The plane runs out of fuel and Dailey accidentally bails out over France instead of England . Here he is picked up and quizzed by the maquis in the person of Corrine Calvet , tempting as creme brulee . She gives him some important film about the German V-2 rocket sites and , to get him through German lines , pretends to marry him during a loud party . He drinks too much wine and the next morning is hustled aboard a British Motor Torpedo Boat suffering from lack of sleep and a calamitous hangover . The crew of the MTB believe he's sea sick and force feed him a tot of rum which mostly spills down his chest . He delivers the film to the astounded authorities in England . He can barely keep awake so they give him a belt of scotch to revive him . He's immediately flown back to Washington , crowded behind the pilot in a P-38 . He's groggy from lack of sleep so the pilot gives him a shot of cognac which Dailey feebly pushes away . During his report to General Marshall , he mumbles and weaves before passing out , so they try to give him some bourbon to revive him before he is whisked away to a hospital . By this time , Dailey is incoherent and the physicians try to put him in a straight jacket before he manages an escape . He makes it back to Punxatawny on a freight train , staggers to his home and begins to crawl in through the kitchen window . His father mistakes him for a burglar and whops him over the head with a night stick . To revive him , his mother gives him a glass of cooking sherry . Mistaking it for milk , Dailey takes a gulp or two then spews out the rest all over the floor . All is resolved and Dailey is to be given a medal by the president . As he is being flown away , the CO of the local airfield smiles and says , " Remind me to give that boy a good conduct medal . " It's nothing like the comic interludes of " What Price Glory , " more amusing than funny . Dailey worked with Ford on two other pictures and there are a few familiar faces here and there - - Jack Pennick as a drill sergeant . It's never slow . The pace is fast but somehow feels forced , as if Ford were anxious to get through it and begin something that interested him more . A lot depends on Dan Dailey as the central figure , and actually he's pretty good . He never seems to have found a niche in Hollywood . He was tall and was a decent hoofer but was mostly confined to supporting roles or as part of an ensemble . His acting style was bluff and straightforward but perhaps he didn't have the face of a leading man . And he didn't grow into an interesting character actor either . All of it a minor puzzle . Ford didn't provide much help . All of Ford's movies had comic elements in them but , like Alfred Hitchcock , his essays at pure comedy , like " Donovan's Reef , " didn't quite click . Comedy was Howard Hawks territory . It's worth seeing , this movie , a perky and good-natured comedy .
443437	819382	49656	5.0	Suspenseful .	This film , " Ransom ! " with an exclamation point ( 1956 ) , is the original from which Ron Howard's " Ransom " wth no exclamation point ( 1996 ) , was derived forty years later . It's not very common for a remake to equal the original - - hell , it's rare ! But in some ways the more recent version beats this one . The recent version is really quite different . ( The exclamation points should be transposed . ) " Ransom ! " focuses exclusively on Glenn Ford , who underacts as the father of the kidnapped boy , and Donna Reed plays the overwrought mother . We never even see the kidnappers , who decide to play ball with Ford after he decides that his son will be killed whether he pays the ransom or not , and so threatens to offer the full amount as a reward to whoever drops the dime on the criminals if they don't return his son . It gets a little dull . Ford has no idea that his son may be dead already until the police and a friendly reporter clue him in to the very real possibility . Ford suffers a lot and sweats through his decision while Donna Reed goes to pieces on him . The remake gives us equal time with the gang of kidnappers , a varied group , some mean , some with consciences and loyalties . The remake is an edgier film with far more action and blood and the kind of shoot out at the climax that producers , writers , and directors seem to believe a modern audience demands . The chief heavy in the remake , Gary Sinese , not only has his face pounded into a substance with the texture and specific gravity of guacamole but is finally plugged multiple times , first by the vengeful father . The director of the remake , Ron Howard , is given to producing smooth , uplifting family films with neat happy endings . This one is a little rougher than his usual fare , but Richard Price contributed to the screenplay and he has a flair for dialog that is unexpected and catchy . Maybe that helped . The plots in both versions are very similar of course . Dad decides not to pay ransom and threatens to give it away as a reward to any squealer , regardless of what happens ( or has already happened ) to his son . The kidnappers have a choice of turning the kid over alive or else constantly wondering which of their friends is going to turn them in for a million bucks . This is a variant of a game called " the prisoner's dilemma , " which I won't describe for two reasons . One is that it would take too long . The other is that I've forgotten which variant of the game is embodied in this plot . Interested parties can look up " the prisoner's dilemma " on the internet . I think Wikipedia . com has an entry on it . Maybe not . This original isn't a bad film . The difference between the two is that this one concentrates on Ford's moral quandary , while the remake shifts more towards the action side of the spectrum , giving it somewhat richer visuals . This isn't seen on TV very often , but if it's on it would be worth watching . The question hanging over the father's head is a heavy one . Should he pay the million bucks for his son or not ? If I had it , I would certainly have gone ahead and paid it for my son , even though the little tyke hasn't yet shown me the proper respect or indicated any interest in a career in medicine . Come to think of it , I'd have to wrestle with the decision - - but in the end I'd have paid . Probably .
442153	819382	31708	5.0	" Holy Pancakes . "	The entries is this series are pretty much alike . Nancy Drew ( Bonita Granville ) , a teen-aged girl , finds some mystery in Riverside Heights and pursues it , despite the warnings of her father and friends , to its happy end . Everything is shot on the cheap on the Warner's back lot . The startling feature of this film , and the others , is Bonita Granville . While not strikingly attractive , she has what might be called a presence . Oh , she overacts outrageously but so does everyone else . But she flits from place to place like a hummingbird , flounces flouncing , both hands held in the air like Fred Astaire , whipping along , subject to speech pressure like a hypomanic . Except when whispering - - " There's a hidden door somewhere . " And even that deserves an exclamation point which I refuse to give it . Her friend , confidant , and unwitting fool , is Ted Nickerson , a gawky adolescent boy . Nancy Drew inveigles him into so many questionable enterprises , after most of which he winds up humiliated , and she shows so little interest in him , that at some point he must ask himself , " What have you done for me lately ? " Oh , Ted . You poor schmuck . Another few years and you'd be wearing a brown uniform in a brown milieu while Nancy was back home forgetting all about you .
443557	819382	109906	5.0	Tiptoes Around an Interesting Question .	The movie itself isn't very good . It moves slowly and is badly photographed . The lighting makes too much use of neon blue , a popular fad around the time this appeared . The acting is okay , though , except for Ice Cube , who cannot seem to act . The score is routine . The script has two good things going for it . One is that the cops , though authoritarian in manner and attitude , are humanized without being sentimentalized . I'll give an example of what I mean by this . One scene , between Walsh and Ironsides , reveals to us and to Ironsides , that Walsh's cancer which had been though to be in remission has now metastasized and he's dying . Nothing much is made of the scene . Nobody breaks into tears . And Ironsides doesn't offer any false hope or , indeed try to comfort his friend in any way . He simply sits there and listens while Walsh , again without going into it , quietly talks about how he'd like to leave his family with a little something . The script and the director handle Walsh's death scene in the same understated way . Walsh's comrades try to revive him and finally give up . None of the assembled cops says anything . Cops wouldn't . But they are clearly moved by the passing of their friend . That's what I mean by " humanizing " them without " sentimentalizing " them . The second interesting thing about the film is that it dips a toe into some curious and seldom-dealt-with sociological waters . It brings up the question of primary allegiances . That is , to whom do we owe our main loyalty ? Which group are we willing to make the most sacrifices for ? Some groups are far more demanding of us than others . I may not care much about being a mailman , for instance , but I care an awful lot about being , say , an African-American mailman . Most ethnic groups are surrounded by clear social borders - - you're either one of us or you are not one of us . The same is true for some other groups - - doctors , airline pilots , U . S . Marines , and stunt men , to mention a few examples that I'm familiar with . Cops demand that kind of loyalty too . And here we have two " minority " members who find themselves working for the Sheriff's Office . Boatman is black and is a cop . Lori Petty is a woman ( and a Jew , I think ) and is a cop too . Which allegiance takes priority - - the allegiance to the minority group or to one's comrades on the police force ? What happens when loyalties come into conflict ? The film brings the question up but soon dumps it . Both rookies try to show their loyalty to their partners by hiding mistakes and so forth , but then they quickly return to the politically correct corners . Boatman realizes that he is black before he is blue . And why not ? There's not a bad African-American to be seen . Petty undergoes a similar transformation . It's kind of a cheap way out . We can all feel satisfied now that our true identities have been found and all the corrupt and dissembling cops have been cleaned out . Sure . I wouldn't recommend this , really . The missed opportunities are wincingly obvious . It's rather overlong , too , and the story resembles " Serpico . " Even the title is second-hand . " The Glass Shield . " It sounds like a variation on the pop culture phrase , " the glass ceiling , " suggesting that the female cop , Lori Petty , will run into prejudices . ( She does , but that has nothing to do with the plot . ) The title also references other paradoxical titles like " Steel Magnolias , " " Iron Butterfly , " " Led Zeppelin , " " Limp Biskit " , " The Glass Key . " If it took more than five seconds to arrive at the title , the writers didn't deserve their paycheck .
441760	819382	42960	5.0	Portrait of the Protagonist as Schmuck .	Poor Farley Granger . He's memorable largely because of three pictures he made : " Side Street , " " Strangers on a Train , " and " They Live by Night . " ( In two of them he played opposite Cathy O'Donnell , as he does here . ) The roles were almost the same . Innocent young guy gets swept up in all kinds of murderous shenanigans , pursued by cops , wanting only peace of mind and his girl friend . This one is really more of a crime drama than a film noir , depending on the generosity of your definition . Granger steals what he believes to be two hundred dollars out of an unguarded filing cabinet . It turns out to be thirty large , blackmail owed by a prominent figure to a , well , a working girl . Stricken by conscience , Granger tries to return the money . But what a schlemiel he truly is . He could have simply kept the money because , after all , nobody has any idea he took it . And the blackmailing girl having been killed by her boyfriend , the money now belongs to nobody . He could have mailed the victim the remaining funds . He certainly knows the name and address since he was the mailman . Failing that , if he insisted on returning the money in person , the last thing even a low-mimetic type like Granger would do is waltz into the victim's office , announce his name and address , and then claim he was merely a " go-between " acting for a " friend " who wanted to give back the loot . Granger is saddled with a young wife and a brand new baby , who is only in the film long enough for us to witness his display of paternal pride . He needs the dough , you see . But every time he thinks he's being smart , posing as someone else , ferreting out the address of someone he needs to talk to , he gets outwitted , bopped on the head , and at the end he's taken for a ride towards the East River . He escapes , but barely . Paul Kelly provides the Reed Hadley narration at the beginning and the end . " This is a man who is a little weak , like some of us . A little foolish , just like most of us . " ( I wonder how often Rod Serling saw this . ) There is a nicely staged climactic chase and shoot out while cop cars zoom after a taxi . It ends in front of the New York City Courthouse . Granger is only wounded and while O'Donnell weeps and tries to smooch him through the ambulance window , Kelly reassures us , " He'll be alright . " Sure he will . As soon as he finds a way to beat the raps for grand theft larceny , breaking and entering , and several charges of felony obstruction of justice . Yet I kind of liked it . Neat location shooting . Manhattan in 1950 , more smog than today but fewer people . The bartender knows your name , although you can't trust him . One murder every day , Kelly tells us , as if this were shocking . ( In 1990 , there were 2 , 245 murders , or 6 . 2361111 every day . ) Not a sign of the potential energy the city was pregnant with , just about to become kinetic - - Kerouac , Burroughs , Cassidy , Ginsberg , Pollack . There isn't much location shooting but what there is , is effective . When Granger looks at a phone book , we see New York in 1950 , when the phone numbers has real NAMES for exchanges . Names like Plaza . And Murray Hill . And Circle . And Grammercy . What do you find now ? More NUMBERS , that's what you find ! 21212324680 ! You call that a telephone number ? And you're lucky to get the ( 212 ) instead of that new-fangled low-class one . Where did it all go ? Pass those Kleenex , would you ? Thanks . ( Sob ) Anyway , the plot at times becomes a bit twisted and hard to follow as everyone tries to track down everyone else , but you'll probably enjoy it .
443157	819382	38975	6.0	Effective , spooky , Victorian murder mystery .	Dorothy McGuire plays Helen , a mute maid in the Victorian mansion owned by the ailing , bed-bound Ethel Barrymore . It's never a good time to be mute , but this is a particularly bad period because someone is going around in the nearby town and killing young women with imperfections . The constable comes around to warn that the clues seem to point to Barrymore's mansion , so look out . There are plenty of people in the mansion to look out for . There are Barrymore's two sons - - the older professor , George Brent , and the young cocky womanizer , Gordon Oliver . There's the ravishing Rhonda Fleming , of whom Oliver remarks , " I never realized your hands were so strong . " There's the hefty , bitter nurse , Sara Allgood , who never has a good word for anybody . There's Elsa Lanchester as a charwoman who spends most of her time dead drunk or planning to get so . There's her husband , Rhys Williams , uncouth , unkempt , menacing . And then there's Barrymore's doctor , Kent Smith , who falls in love with McGuire , while she reciprocates . Yes , plenty to go around . This is a big mansion . It's a NEAT mansion too , come to think of it . Daryll Silvera was the set dresser and he seems to have gotten everything just right - - the ugly portraits on the walls , the overstuffed furniture , the kerosene lamps , the ugly kitchens , the cobweb-ridden cellar , the potted palms , the elaborately curved dark wood of the paneling and the artfully gnarled staircase . It's even better when there's an electrical storm raging outside and the wind blows out the candles . We soon conclude that someone in the house is doing all these murders - - but which one of them ? Certainly not McGuire . She's the requisite woman-in-jeopardy . Ethel Barrymore is glum and seems to be hiding something , but she's bed-bound . ( Or is she ? ) The professor ? He's aloof , true , but he reacts with sensible concern to portentous news . There's the vain and imperious Rhonda Fleming , but she's eliminated as a suspect simply by means of transition to victimhood . The arrogant younger son , then ? Much too obvious . Ditto for Rhys Williams and , unless she's faking it , the bibulous Elsa Lanchester . Well , how about Kent Smith , as Dr . Parry ? Oh , he LOOKS benign enough , placid of countenance , pacific of demeanor , soothing of voice . But at one point , he tells the younger brother that he'd like to break his neck . Is that a hint of suppressed violence ? Probably not . Kent Smith is the long-suffering husband of Simone Simon in " The Cat People . " His specialty is passivity . He could never kill anybody . Besides , he's a Harvard man and it would be rude . When this film was released , it was accompanied in advertisements by a warning that young people shouldn't attend . They might be too frightened . Today , that should give us quite a laugh . It's a dark and brooding murder mystery set in an old house and although there's a good deal of suspense , there is no violence to speak of . Nicely atmospheric film , though I don't know that that would appeal to some in today's audience who would be impatiently waiting for the ax to appear .
443551	819382	45919	6.0	If God had meant man to fly . . . .	Ernest K . Gann has an idiosyncratic prose style , precious and precise at the same time . He tends to use a lot of interior monologue and description and he throws in little unexpected tidbits - - " And where , pray tell , is home ? " Reading his work is a little like flying an airplane . Nothing much happens , but when it happens , it happens fast . " The High and the Mighty " , a novel , has just enough dialog and action to make a conventional movie . His meandering memoir , " Fate is the Hunter , " has mostly a few clipped exchanges of dialog , which I guess made it next to impossible to film . In making the movie of " Fate is the Hunter , " all they kept was the title , which was nice and commercial . I haven't read Gann's " Island in the Sky " , but there are enough flashbacks and narrations in the movie ( by actors and by an omniscient observer who is allowed to voice Gann's finely phrased expressions ) that the book must have been full of the author's reflections and the action was sparse . The story is simple . Dooley ( Wayne ) is piloting a DC-3 over Canada when it ices up and he must land on a frozen lake in an unexplored woodland . His buddies get together and fly around looking for him , sometimes just barely missing him . Just as the crew's supplies are about to run out , they find him and drop supplies and note his position for a rescue team . One of the crew has frozen to death . I saw the movie when I was a kid and thought it was great . It was shown on TV recently and it now strikes me as good rather than great because I think I have a better handle on the meaning of the word " great . " Really , the movie grabs you . Very suspenseful stuff , done in a craftsmanlike manner . Will they ever find Dooley and his crew ? You don't really know until the climax , although , knowing Wayne's image at the time , it would be hard to imagine that he would appear in a film that closed on a shot of him frozen stiff like the Reclining Buddha . ( I mean , the guy hesitated before admitting he had lung cancer because it might damage his public image ! ) The location shooting around Truckee in the Sierras is nice - - black figures scuttling around on blazing white snow - - but the picture cries out for color . The crisp beauty of the setting would have contrasted with the nearly doomed situation of the crew . It's an enjoyable movie partly because so many of the faces in it are familiar ones - - I won't bother to list them . And the performances are all pretty good , except , I suppose , we could have done without Dooley's navigator breaking into tears at his failure to specify their exact location . The scene is overacted , as are some others , and the director should have reined in the excess of statement . There are some other signs of directorial laxity . We can hear the wind whistling loudly but the branches aren't moving . Only rarely does an actor's breath turn to steam - - and it's 40 below . The scene in which the copilot freezes to death , only a few feet from the airplane , is in its own crude way heartbreaking . The weaknesses I've mentioned probably won't bother kids any more than they bothered me when I was a kid . Good suspense , good atmosphere , decent acting , magnificent shots of airplanes over the unexplored woods of northern Canada , desperation and relief , add up to a watchable film . Worth catching .
442630	819382	219699	6.0	Let us now praise Blanchett .	A widow with ESP ( Cate Blanchett ) lives with her son in a small Southern town , helping people by trying to " read " their futures and living on donations . There are folks who don't like that kind of devlish stuff ' round here . Katie disappears . Blanchett , who is one of those psychics who cannot control their " visions " so that she can only get glimpses of things that have happened or might happen , has a vision of Holmes ' body at the bottom of a pond . She reveals her vision to the Sheriff ( good performance by Dr . Emil Skoda , I mean J . K . Simmons ) . Well , he's one of the local empiricists and doesn't believe her but takes her out to a pond resembling the one seen in her vision . Sure enough . They drag Katie's remains out of it . Where was Tom Cruise when she needed him ? I won't go on with the plot . It gets twisted around a bit and the end won't come as a great big surprise if you've seen a couple of other thrillers with metaphysical overtones . It was written by the co-authors of the far superior , " One False Move . " But this is a pretty weak effort . We hear New Age lines from a bunch of small-minded townies . A man and a woman are attracted to one another but when he comes on to her , she backs hesitantly away and says , " I don't think this is a good idea right now . " ( The guy is falling-down drunk so it's hard to see what the idea was in the first place . ) " She's gone , " the man tells the woman , " but I have to learn to live with that , just as you have to learn to live with the loss of your husband . " ( Real MEN don't talk like that . ) And , later , " I'm so sorry I wasn't there for you when you needed me . " The director , Raimi , is efficient without being in the least original . The music cues us about looming threats . When Blanchett is worried , a shadow crosses her curtain - - but it turns out to be a friend ! As the climax approaching , to heighten the tension , there is a windy thunderstorm full of rain and strobe lightning . ( Ho hum . ) At the end , when all is being revealed , the rain is replaced by fog . One blow from a flashlight conks a full-grown man out for the duration just because the script calls for it . Blanchett is about to be murderized at the pond but she is saved by a disturbed young man whom she had earlier tried to help . The young man , Giovanni Ribisi , is supposed to be in a psychiatric hospital but , " I escaped , " he tells her . He doesn't tell her how he managed to find her and her would-be murderer in the middle of the woods in the middle of the night in the fog . Well , not that it matters , because it turns out that Ribisi has actually been dead for a couple of hours anyway . This takes us beyond the possibility of ESP and into the realm of the frankly supernatural . This raises certain interesting questions but the film doesn't address them . It's satisfied to be another everyday thriller with parallel universe harmonics . All of that makes it sound like a movie to avoid but it's not . The reason it's not is that mysteries are kind of interesting . Whodunnit , you know ? And the movie is saved by Cate Blanchett's sterling performance . She makes the movie . She isn't exactly beautiful . She's lean and narrow shouldered . Her nose is long and pulpy , and her epicanthic fold is overdeveloped by Western tastes . But faces have characteristics or traits . Angelina Jolie's primary trait is sexuality . Gene Tierney's was staggering beauty . Agnes Moorehead's was sliminess of a particularly feminine sort . Blanchett's primary trait is perceptivity . Not intelligence in any academic sense , but an ability to figure things out , to see through them , to discern patterns and form Gestalts . This trait is put to good use , of course , in a role that calls for psychic abilities , but she showed the same ability to use her skills in " Elizabeth " too , where instead of hesitancy and anxiety the role called for a growing self confidence . Her accent alone is fascinating . Her Commonwealth speech is quite thoroughly transformed into Southernness here . It's not the hillbilly speech of the upland South , and it's not from the low country either . Its closest analog is probably Texas or Oklahoma . She has even the slightest of marks down right . " I didn't really think anything OF it . " And the vowel is prolonged and drawn out in a manner only found in the American South . ( The same speech sound is heard in the vowel in " druuuunk . " ) Sorry . Bit of regional linguistics there . Oh - - I ought to mention wardrobe too . A fine job . They've given Blanchett exactly the right unpretentious floppy clothes that an ordinary lower-middle-class Southern widow of no sophistication might wear . Example : In one important scene , she wears this fuzzy white V-necked sweater - - angora or cashmere or something . ( I don't know anything about women's clothes but I know what I like . ) Underneath this sweater , though , there is a rough white T shirt that leaves a cartoon alligator's face peeping over the sweater's V neck . Exactly the proper degree of sloppiness . Yet in another scene , at a party , her hair is draped around her long face is lustrous curls and when she reaches down to remove a tight shoe we can't help noticing how sleek her ankle and her feet are , and neither can Kinnear , the guy she's with . But without Cate Blanchett's superior performance this would be no more than a routine thriller . With her , it rises rather above the routine and is worth catching .
441825	819382	66473	6.0	Think Before You Attack .	There aren't any big stars in this movie but many fine and reliable actors . It's competently directed . A monumental amount of money was spent on it . It's as historically accurate as the limits of commercial film making allowed . It's about an event of great magnitude . The director considers it one of his best films . So why does it fall short of expectations ? Maybe because the expectations are too high , given the effort that went into the production . After all is said and done , it's an attempt to recreate the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and make a movie out of it . It's not the attack itself . We all realize that great care and lots of dough were lavished on the sets but they look cheesy nevertheless . The models are identifiably models . And historical errors abound , due to simple carelessness . The bombers and torpedo planes can pass , but the AT-6 Texan trainers do not look or fly like Zeros . ( This is one instance in which CGI would have been a genuine help if used - - properly , not in the zany way of " Pearl Harbor . " ) There's nothing wrong with most of the performances . The tension associated with the raid is forcefully conveyed . And there is one scene , in which the commander of the Japanese Air Group wordlessly shakes Fuchida's hand and Fuchida pauses for a moment , then smiles glowingly before mounting his airplane , that is thrilling . In small parts , Richard Anderson is a little too obvious , and poor Neville Brand is unbelievable as anything more than a flabby ex-actor . Jason Robards , by the way , who plays General Short , was a third-class radioman in the Navy at Pearl Harbor during the attack and actually copied the transmitted message , " Air Raid Pearl Harbor . This is no drill . " Soh Yamamura , as Admiral Yamamoto , is given a great line at the end of the film . " I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve . " The line is so good , so portentous , so apt , that I've seen it attributed to Yamamoto as a direct quote , when in fact it was written expressly for the movie . It may become one of those factoids that , having been invented for fiction , are passed on as fact . The " thumbs up " and " thumbs down " gestures after gladiator brawls are in the same factoidal territory , having been invented on the spot for a silent film . It's not a bad movie , not poorly done , and it's light years ahead of " Pearl Harbor . " But there are enough errors of judgment in the direction , and a few in the script , to render it disappointing . Richard Fleischer actually believed that if you captured a P-40 careering out of control from five different angles and exploding spectacularly , scattering debris everywhere , the viewer would not realize it was the same incident being filmed from different angles and so could be used repeatedly . The viewer realizes and even feels a little cheated and condescended to .
442982	819382	47956	6.0	Undemanding Biography	I find it kind of enjoyable in a smooth , Hollywood kind of way . Billy Mitchell did go through the various experiences we see on screen , only not in the particular details shown . The deck is stacked in favor of Gary Cooper as the hero , Billy Mitchell . I read a reasonably balanced biography of Mitchell some years ago and he didn't come across as the idealistic firebrand we see on screen . Rather , as I remember it , he had married well and was something of a social aristocrat , which isn't bad in itself . The story's probably familiar . Mitchell is an advocate of air power and , against orders , blows a test battleship out of the water with out-sized 2 , 000 pound bombs . For this he's sent to Siberia in Texas . When his friend in killed in an airship accident and other friends expire in a cross-country flight , he makes a public announcement accusing the War Department of being " criminally negligent " and " almost treasonable . " For this he gets a court martial , found guilty , and is cashiered . He was evidently correct about a number of things . The day of the battleship was limited . The majority lost by all sides in World War II were sunk by airplanes . No air force ever used 2 , 000 pound bombs though , with one exception ( the Tirpitz ) to sink them . Nor did air supremacy ever win a war by itself . Not in World War II - - and not since then . The best scene - - both the most dramatic and the most unintentionally comic - - is the court martial scene . Every participant in the trial has a single dimension . There are the good guys and the bad guys . The bad guys are winning at the start but the tide turns and they lose . The last witness is Mitchell himself . He not only has to undergo the agonizing ordeal of being cross-examined by a particularly slimy and sarcastic Rod Steiger but he must be suffering from an attack of malaria at the same time . Man , does he suffer . He keeps a handkerchief to his face , patting away the sweat . I don't recall from his biography whether Mitchell actually made the predictions attributed to him by the film . They include a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor by planes from aircraft carriers 150 miles off the Hawaiian coast . The enemy will be the Japanese . He also calls for the Air Force as an independent branch of the armed forces . This is , like , 1927 , mind you . Steiger keeps making snotty references to Mitchell's " crystal ball . " A friend and I made up outrageous Mitchell predictions that might have been cut from the script . The Finns will build an undersea tunnel and fly airplanes that will come out of a Washington sewer and bomb the White House , and so forth . Well - - who knows ? Anyway I get a kick out of it . Worth catching if you don't care much about historical accuracy . Oh - - and Kids , in 1941 the Japanese actually DID do what Billy Mitchell said they would . It began what we call " World War II . " PS : We won .
442540	819382	58997	6.0	Entertaining , offbeat mystery from Preminger .	Carol Lynley joins her brother Keir Dullea in England , bringing her daughter Bunny . On her first day Lynley drops Bunny off at a day school , whence Bunny disappears . It seems that no one at the school or anywhere else remembers meeting Bunny . The police , in the form of Superintendent Lawrence Olivier , are brought in on the case and eventually suspect that Bunny may be imaginary . Is she ? Well , we can be sure of one thing . Carol Lynley's landlord , Horatio Wilson ( Noel Coward ) doesn't care . He's the most entertaining character in the film , a seedy , egomaniacal alcoholic poet and BBC person who collects artifacts associated with the Marquis DeSade , such as his whips and his skull - - " At least they told me it was his in Caledonia . " He sounds as if he'd written his own dialog . His voice is appallingly plummy as he tells the succulent Lynley how , at the BBC , there are " persons who bear , like medals , bruises signifying the love of Horatio Wilson . " He's designed to be a chief suspect , I suppose , what with his greasy self display , and since nobody else around seems to be sufficiently crazy to kidnap a kid , if indeed there was a kid to be napped . But there the casting stumbles , because to whom could Noel Coward be a threat except himself ? Carol Lynley and Keir Dullea , on the other hand , are ideally matched . They look in their bland beauty as if they really MIGHT be brother and sister , smiling mannequins in the window of some boutique clothing shop . And they act within the same strictures too . The sing-along quality of their voices are similar . Dullea in particular speaks oddly . If he asks a simple question - - " Did you search the place ? " - - each syllable is pitched slightly higher than the preceding one , so there is a monotonic ascending scale , and the terminal contours of " place " reach for the ionosphere . Yet none of this comes across as amateurish . Instead it sounds deliberately stylized , as if Lynley and Dullea had been instructed to sound somewhat artificial . That sense of pretense casts further doubt on the truth of Lynley's story about a missing daughter , and as it turns out , Dullea has every right to sound like a child reading lies from off-stage cue cards . Lawrence Olivier is hardly short of amazing in what he does with an almost stereotyped character that John Williams could have walked through without leaving a footprint - - the calm , logical , not insensitive police detective who unravels the case . What a magnetic actor . The score is based on a simple , nearly infantile melody , and handled nicely , featuring flutes and at one particularly apt point a harpsichord in counterpoint . At its best it reminds one of Elmer Bernstein's pretty tune in " To Catch a Mockingbird . " But it's all over the movie , whether it's needed or not . And sometimes the score lapses into jarring dissonant chords and bonking xylophones that distract the viewer . The last fifteen minutes or so are tense but idiotic .
442198	819382	106661	6.0	Routine romantic intrigue , interestingly played out .	There isn't much new in the idea . Two women , both hungry , living alone . A handyman comes in . He does both of them . One , in the course of an unrelated subplot , knifes a man to death and is sent to jail , carrying the handyman's baby . After a year or so , she gets out and is reunited with the handyman , her baby , and the other woman - - happily , it seems . What I kind of like about it is mostly the acting . Barbara Hershey is glamorized and stunning . And Debra Winger gives her character a real life of her own . Man , is she homely . She wears thick glasses , has her hair tied back like the head of a mop , wears no makeup , and pinches her lips together and twitches from time to time . It's the kind of performance - - playing an inadequate socially challenged semi-loony - - that wins Academy Awards . And I appreciated Gabriel Byrne's character and performance too . A by-the-numbers route here would have brought in a ruggedly handsome , perfectly gorgeous , virile , flawless guy , brimming with danger and testosterone . Instead the movie gives us Gabe Byrne . Yes , he's a kind of ne'er do well and a rogue but he's not Vigo Mortenson or Brad Pitt . His face looks as if it's been molded out of candle wax that has begun to melt . He gets drunk just about every night and can't hold a job . He admits he's a lying thief . And - - for this I was particularly grateful - - he never ONCE takes off his shirt and shows us his sweaty chest while splitting logs or , er , plowing a field . One night , drunk , he stumbles into Winger's little bungalow . He's filled with remorse , poses her as a priest in a confessional , asks her , " Are you Catholic ? Ah , never mind , you don't know what the I'm talking about anyway . " Then he begs this rudely shaped lump of clay for absolution and weeps in her lap before kissing her . ( Her first time , we don't doubt . ) She's alternately charmed and horrified . The language and the sex are fairly explicit . The sex includes masturbation , defloration , and - - well , normal intercourse , I guess , if the definition is extended to include coupling on a floor full of broken crockery with one of the partners so deliriously drunk that she believes the man is someone else . It's nicely directed too . No razzle-dazzle . No , " Hey , Ma , look at me ! I got a camera ! " Just one or two shots involving a pair of eyeglasses draw attention to themselves . The rest is very efficiently done . When Strathairn dies , he does so in a most unexpected way , stabbed multiple times , and whining about , " Hey , what did you do to me . " There's blood all over the place , as there should be when someone is bleeding to death , but not a single shot of a knife piercing flesh . And his killer reassuring him as he expires , " It's okay . It's okay . " She can't dial 911 because she can't find her glasses . The end is a little disturbing if you bother to think about it . After all , Debra Winger has stabbed a guy to death over some squabble at her workplace . " A Dangerous Woman " is right . And it appears that Byrne is finally going to make an honest woman out of her . I hope she never gets mad at HIM . The photography is very nicely done . I don't know where it was shot but it looks a bit like the Coachella Valley in California . Nice ranch house . Nice lines of fruit-bearing trees in the orchards . Mountains all around . Fan palms . The Garden of Eden with humans in it .
441776	819382	69906	6.0	Good Early Columbo	You can't help wondering what Lieutenant Columbo's first name was , but maybe it's better that we don't know . Suppose it had turned out to be something like " Jason " or " Brad " . In this entry the epic bumbler is thrust into the world of championship-level chess , more specifically the professional enmity that Lawrence Harvey , the reigning champ , feels towards his good-natured challenger , the older Jack Kruschen , playing an obvious Russian . It's an interesting story , a little complicated , there being not just one secret but several of them , involving shoves into giant garbage disposals , tricking the victim into writing a suicide note , switching medicines , setting up a red herring about a flight to Mexico . I suppose all that is to be expected in a story about chess . It's a complicated game . I should know . I was a child genius at chess and once played ten games simultaneously while blindfolded , losing every one . Something I didn't get comes at the end , though , the climactic reveal . That giant garbage grinder into which Harvey has shoved his opponent shuts off automatically but Harvey doesn't realize it because his hearing aid battery is shot , and he doesn't know the chopper has stopped . Columbo tricks Harvey into demonstrating that , in the absence of his hearing aid , he can't tell the blasted machinery has stopped . And a glow of satisfaction spreads across Columbo's face . But , when you think about it - - so what ? Aside from that , plenty of interesting stuff going on . Escargot with garlic in what passes for a French restaurant in L . A . Made me kind of hungry , watching Kruschen stuff himself . Harvey taking a glance at one of those indecipherable doctor's scrips for four or five medicines and immediately memorizing the whole list . Hart Bochner speaking Russian with a gloopy accent . Kruschen flat-lining with a satisfying stomach full of snails with garlic sauce .
442676	819382	217579	6.0	Not bad for a TV movie .	Gary Lewis and the Playboys , Buddy Holly and the Crickets , Jason and the Argonauts . Sounds like a 1950s rock band but this outfit has legs , the story being at least 2300 years old - - and an oral tradition before that . It's a complicated narrative too . In order to save his mother's hide , Jason is forced by the king ( Dennis Hopper ) to undertake a dangerous sea voyage with two-dozen crew to a distant island and bring back the golden fleece , which is a sheepskin made of golden wool . The crew is full of familiar names . There are Castor and Pollux ( who speak with Slavic accents ) , Hercules , Orpheus , Atalanta , and some others . Well , they're not household worlds exactly , but famous nonetheless . Along the way they encounter dragons , clashing rocks , harpies who are half-bird and half-women and resemble my second-grade teacher , an army of women led by Natasha Henstridge , an angry Poseidon , clashing rocks , armed skeletons born of dragon's teeth , the witch Medea ( Jolene Blalock ) , the jealous king who wants to keep the golden fleece for himself ( Frank Langella ) , and various other dilatory things and events that happen to ordinary people who are in a hurry to get someplace . This movie , splendidly photographed , comes to us from Hallmark , along with their superior production of The Odyssey . There have been a couple of other retellings of the Greek myths lately and I think I know why . It's a chance for a special effects extravaganza . Willis O'Brian of " King Kong " fame was replaced by the more sophisticated effects of Ray Harryhausen , and now it's time for computer-generated images . They're pretty good too . The argonauts land on a rocky island and plant a spear and a giant eyeball appears nearby - - it's not an island at all , but the barnacle bedecked Poseidon taking a snooze , and , man , is he cranky when he wakes up . The weakest part of the film is in the performances . Jolene Blalock , who looks like Hilary Swank , is the image of a beautiful model - - and she acts like one . Adrian Lester , the African-American yuppie in " Primary Colors " , still looks like a yuppie . Olivia Williams as Hera isn't bad at all , but most of the gods and goddesses are no more than competent . For a great Zeus , a Zeus who has a touchy relationship with Hera because she knows he's been getting it on with mortal women , posing as a shower of coins or a swan or something , watch Lawrence Olivier in " Clash of the Titans . " The central figure of Jason is given to Jason London . Now , he may be a great guy in real life for all we know . He probably loves his dog . But he's gotten the pretty boy treatment in this movie . His hair looks done by a fashionable salon on Rodeo Drive . Every female in the film falls in love with him . They fawn over him , give him presents , happily rub oil or wine on his body ( twice ) . It's disgusting . And as if that weren't enough , London's acting is as flat as a pancake , perfectly suitable for a high-school play . Dennis Hopper is a great maniac , but he has to be seen ( and heard ) as a murderous Greek king to be believed . The best performance , surprisingly , is by Brian Thompson as Hercules . You'll recognize him when you see him . He's been an alien on the X-Files and a lank-haired greaseball of a heavy in some features . Still , this would make a good movie for the family . I suppose there are a few semi-nude scenes involving Natasha Henstridge - - not enough to suit me , but not enough to make any 10-year-old's eyes goggle either . The kids will probably treat it as nothing more than another action flick with plenty of CGI , but if they remember it at all , they'll be remembering a Greek myth . It might get them a bonus point on an IQ test sometime later in life .
443084	819382	24368	6.0	Dementia Praewax .	A fast-paced , enjoyable thriller , directed by Michael Curtiz , anticipating the 1953 " House of Wax " . That's the one with Phyllis Thaxter and Vincent Price . This one has the cast you'd associate with a 1933 production - - Fay Wray , Frank McHugh , Lionel Atill , Glenda Farrell as a snippy reporter , and others . The stories are similar . A deranged sculptor , unable to use his burned hands any longer , begins to kill people and kidnap their bodies , coating them in wax for his museum display . An inquisitive young lady discovers the truth . A girl is captured and stripped and bound under a spigot which will soon spout boiling wax . The cops interrupt the proceedings . Ordinarily , compared to their originals , remakes are odious . In this case , I don't know . Actually , both are pretty good . The chief difference is that this was shot in two-strip Technicolor , which gives the viewer not only black and white , but a choice of two designer colors - - albino pink and ghoul green . The photography in the 1953 version is not only more sophisticated and colorful but was 3-D when it was shot . ( Watch out for that bouncing paddle ball ! ) The photography aside , this one has hammier acting , a slightly different plot , and was clearly written before the deranged minds of the censors tried to encase wholesomeness in a waxen shell . Everyone here seems to rush around throwing wisecracks at each other . " He's in the hoosegow . " " How's your sex life ? " " Everyone knew they were living together . " A female figure in the wax museum is , as they used to say , undraped . In the 1953 version the police withhold a drink from an alcoholic until he breaks and spills the beans . Here , it's a " junkie " . There are times when this one is pretty funny , which the later version never was . There's a scene in which Glenda Farrell , the reporter , tries to convince her boss , Frank McHugh , that something is wrong at the museum . Joan of Arc looks too much like a recently disappeared corpse . Farrell : " You ever hear of a death mask ? " McHugh : " I sure have . I was married to one for years . " Farrell : " I know . Then she came to life and divorced you . " The slam-bang quality of the direction and the snappy script cut a bit into the terror of the story , which the later version preserves intact . There's nothing here as scary as the scene in 1953 in which the helpless Phyllis Kirk is being chased through the stylized , deserted New York streets by the hideously disfigured artist . Both are kind of enjoyable in their slightly different ways , though . I always wonder what happens when , not the wax , but the too too solid flesh under it should melt . You ever hear of " the lost wax method " ?
442997	819382	109417	6.0	Miami Bitch	Anyone seeing this will recognize it as a variation on " Body Heat . " In some ways it's better , but in most it's not as good . " Body Heat " had several things going for it that " China Moon " does not . Its sultry score was distinctive . This score is generically blue . So's the photography . In " Body Heat , " the images actually looked hot . In the café scenes you could almost smell the humidity and the fat molecules hanging in the air , although in fact they were probably shot through a Vaseline-coated lens . Here , instead of heat , we get a harsh icy blue tint to many of the scenes . When we are out of doors , in the rain and mud , under the blue lights , it seems positively chilly . ( And the director was a photographer himself ! ) The acting in both films is mixed . Kathleen Turner sounds breathless but doesn't exude a particularly high level of heat energy , whereas Bill Hurt is excellent as a dumb lawyer . Ed Harris here is less inventive that Hurt but does a solid job . As for Madeleine Stowe . It isn't easy to measure physical beauty accurately . Lately psychologists have been fiddling around with various mathematical ratios based on the idea that facial symmetry per se is attractive , but the results so far have been mostly good for laughs . A more reliable , if rougher , way to get at it is to filter one person's appearance through someone else's perception of it . Build an ordinal scale of ranks . You can get a pretty good idea of how attractive a face looks if you ask 100 members of the opposite sex to rank it from one to ten , ten being highest . Stowe , I should think , would come out pretty high on such a scale , although symmetry would have absolutely nothing to do with it , anymore than it would with Nastassja Kinsky or Gwyneth Paltrow . Not a bit of it . Stowe's anthracite irises are slightly crossed under their long black lashes , and her lips are appealingly askew . She may not be symmetrical , but man she could play a Franklin stove and get away with it . The plot , such as it is , isn't as filled with the kind of intrigue and uncertainties of the original model . It has a certain familiar mechanical quality to it . Much more stuff about switched and hidden guns . And it ends in a kind of tragic shootout , instead of a full-throated blast of irony . It's also a bit hard to follow , in a way the original was not . Until the shooting of Stowe's husband , I could understand all of it . Stowe genuinely loved Harris . After that , when the frame begins to take shape , I became confused about when the sinister plot was planned and hatched . And why and when did Stowe's emotion toggle from love to exploitation ? The story no longer made sense , having lost its continuity with the first half . And , surprisingly , it lacks evocative touches and local color . No tinkling wind chimes . No humor to speak of . And Florida ? It could as easily have been Nebraska .
442379	819382	70022	6.0	Stylized study of murder and character .	Everybody likes to ride around on a motorcycle in the sunshine , and , what with the desert climate of southern Arizona , you get not only the wind in your hair and the scent of sagebrush but a rosy tan as well . Unfortunately , Robert Blake and his partner , Zipper ( Billy Green Bush ) , are constrained by their police uniforms and what they call proper police procedure , or PPP . The movie is essentially about how closely the police force follows that procedure when murder is involved . Two old weirdos live in a desert trailer and when one is found murdered the other ( Elisha Cook , Jr . , more flamboozled than ever ) is arrested . But did he do it ? And , if so , why ? The written story is dated . The affable and sympathetic Blake is taken under the wing of his superior , Mitch Ryan , a big blustering detective who beats up hippie informants while Blake must stand silently by . Yes , this is a movie which pits the ugly cops against the far-from-innocent but still human hippies . The hippies dress in rags , do dope , and - - hold on - - they have long hair . All they want is to be left unhassled , but Ryan is intent on cementing community relations by beating them to a pulp . Mitchell is not only a bully but , even worse , his drunken girl friend explains to Blake that he is also impotent , causing Mitchell to almost pop his cork and hate Blake , finally demoting him and putting him back in uniform on his hated police motorcycle . ( He'd love to have a more colorful machine with Electraglide transmission . ) I think Blake's motorcycle represents the police force , which in turn represents the society which the hippies must live in and which hates them for reasons that are " accidental " rather than " essential . " Mainly , they look funny . ( None of them can act , either . ) In fact , I think Robert Blake's character must illustrate Edmund Burke's dictum , " All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing . " How else can we explain this good man's assassination by previously harassed hippies at the end ? Why else does Blake suffer ? He's guilty of no wrong doing , intelligent enough to solve a rather complicated homicide , and in the end courageous enough to tell his sadistic boss that the boss is full of horse hockey . The dialog is kind of stylized , especially Mitch Ryan's . He carries on with his rodomontade as if speaking to Jesus . It isn't exactly realistic . That's okay because at least it's an attempt to be original . The narrative , though , sometimes falls flat . After being promoted to detective by Ryan , Blake lovingly dresses himself in expensive new civilian clothes , if a modified cowboy outfit can be considered civilian , and strides outside only to look down and see that he's forgotten to put on his trousers . It's not really either credible or amusing , though it's supposed to be cute , I guess . The direction is okay . The camera is where it should be , and at the proper times , but - - can we have some kind of moratorium on slow-motion violence ? Sheez ! A pursued hippie on a motorcycle crashes through a cafe window and I fell asleep before he finally hit the floor . The climactic scene was shot in Monument Valley . Warning to all film makers . Lay off . That's John Ford territory .
442017	819382	33740	6.0	Proto-noir	Betty Grable as the heroine has that cream-fed complexion and chirrupy optimism of the American Midwest . She doesn't really belong in what purports to be a film noir . Well , it isn't a film noir anyway , exactly . It's a murder mystery set in the kind of uptrodden Manhattan milieu in which people like Alan Mowbray as an aging ham hang out , drinking champagne , smoking endless cigarettes , and making urbane wisecracks . The non-noir elements , the film blanc elements , so to speak , create the kind of environment that suits Betty Grable well . The women are in cocktail dresses and the men in tuxedos adorned with carnations , like a Fred Astaire movie , or like the one she made with Astaire years earlier , " The Gay Divorcée . " The angles are sometimes crooked and tilted , though , and the lighting does at times cast strange shadows from oddly placed lights - - chicken-wire cages , venetian blinds . But the characters , for the most part , belong to an old , familiar genre . Victor Mature is breezy in double-breasted suits and triple-breasted grins . The police who are hunting the killer of Betty Grable's sister are nasty but not rough . Mature , being grilled as a suspect in the murder , insults them and gets away with it , without his head being turned to squash . The only truly noir figure in the film is Laird Cregar , almost always shot from below , the lighting emphasizing his porcine features . He's sinister in a way no one else in the film is . And that voice ! Insinuating , soft but rapacious . Towards the end of the film , you're convinced he's going to be the murderer , but no - - the solution to the mystery is shrugged off in a few seconds and lands instead on the shoulders of poor Elisha Cook , Jr . , a creepy mouse . Not that the bulky and threatening Cregar is let off the hook entirely . He turns out to be what we would now call a fetishist . I won't describe the details but he puts an end to his self loathing in a way that turns him very neatly from uncovered villain to pathetic nobody . Summing it up , a kind of upscale murder drama shot with the noir techniques that were to become so common in films over the next fifteen years or so . This was 1941 . The unquiet lighting and camera angles are there but they hadn't found the right property yet .
442179	819382	39808	6.0	Amusing farce	Whatever the setting , and there were many , Danny Kaye always played himself - - the hypochondriacal , stuttering , cowardly , nervously fiddling neurotic . That's pretty much what he is here , and if you haven't seen a Danny Kaye movie this is a pretty funny introduction . The plot violates James Thurber's short story , the point of which was that Walter Mitty daydreamed so much because his own life was so dull . It's probably Thurber's most popular story , although " If Grant Had Been Drinking at Appomatox " has more outright laughs . Here Kaye is involved in one richly comic episode after another . The famous fantasies are pretty much gotten out of the way before the movie is half over . The " real " scenes are at least as amusing . He's a copy editor at a pulp magazine in New York and Boris Karloff , he of the ominous lisp , is pitching him a story about a doctor who murders people without leaving a trace by pressing on a nerve at the base of the skull . " Oh , we've already used that in ' The Revenge of the Gland Specialist ' , " objects Kaye . The plot is a mystery about the planned theft of the Dutch Crown Jewels . Something to do with a murder Kaye witnesses ( nobody believes him ) , a black book , Kaye singing silly songs , a chief conspirator nicknamed " the Boot , " and a dazzling innocent blond - - Virginia Mayo - - who has a pretty sassy figure . Watching her and Kaye talking about corsets reminded me that when I was a teen , all women seemed to be wrapped up in inexplicable buckles , plastic straps , and clips that only a deranged mechanical engineer could design . Come to think of it , I'm still out of it . I don't know whether women leave body gel on or wash it off , or what bath beads are . And when did " lipstick " turn into " lip rouge , " and " rouge " turn into " blush , " and " mascara " into " kohl " - - or DID it ? Somebody is pulling the wool over somebody's eyes around here . You ought to see this if only for the costume design and hair styles . Wow - - what exotica ! It's impossible to believe that women ever dressed like this , or hoped to , despite Fritz Feld's glutinous paean to a hat that , although it looks like something Calder might have dreamed up during a horrible hangover , can be disassembled into three - - count ' em - - three separate parts and then be piece together into yet another arrangement . Put a tiny quail under that feathery apparatus and you're talking a two-hundred dollar entree at a four-star Parisian restaurant . There's a likable element of running gags in here too . On three occasions Kaye's blustery boss is holding important business meetings when Kaye enters unexpectedly - - once simply late , and twice more crawling backward in through the tenth floor window pursued by pigeons . Kaye's decline was sad . He wound up singing " Thumbelina " to a nearly empty night club in later years . But he's at his peak here , and his peak was pretty good .
442569	819382	71838	6.0	Nothing Original , But Entertaining .	This could easily have been a script leftover in some shoebox from an unmade 1949 noir . It's a complicated story of blackmail and betrayal . Burt Lancaster is an ex-cop just released from prison , given a job by an old friend ( Cameron Mitchell ) as night watchman at a college , who falls in love with his parole officer ( Susan Clark ) . A murder takes place . Several murders take place . And some of the signs seem to point to the innocent Burt . There's a blackmail plot with lots of money involved . Well , now , Burt may have just gotten out of the slams but he hasn't unlearned the investigative skills he picked up while on the job in Chicago . Fighting against the local cops every inch of the way , he cracks the case , but not to his satisfaction . He's been used and betrayed by everyone he was close to . No one looks out of place . Susan Clark actually looks pretty darned smokin ' , with her slender figure and queer beauty , a little goofy , like Nancy Travis ' . The local cops are villainous . There is a trio of redneck heavies that - - well , they shouldn't look out of place but they do . This was shot in South Carolina , but it's winter , and it doesn't look like the South , whereas these three unkempt miscreants ( including Ed Sauter with his working-class New York accent ) look like they're straight out of some Southern Gothic slasher movie - - I EAT YOUR HEAD AND SPIT DOWN YOUR NECK CAVITY ! ! ! One is fat , one is scrawny , all are dumb drunks who tote shotguns and pitchforks and allow themselves to be run over by tractors . They even have one of those mean mothers in Bibb overalls and boots who sneers at captive Burt and says , " Wait'll Lem gets back . He'll take care of you proper-like , " or something . There isn't a touch of anything original in the direction , the script , the performances , or anything else . Dave Grusin's score is loud and conventional - - lots of electric guitars and harmonicas and nerve-jangling percussion . Nobody seems to have put any effort into it , which is a little surprising , given Burt Lancaster's tendency to see to it that some social message informs his story , or at least that there is the occasional arty touch . But not here . Everything is functional . No tag lines worth remembering . Instead of Burt Lancaster it might as well have been Charles Bronson . Yet I like the thing and I look forward to seeing it on those infrequent occasions when it shows up on TV . I don't know why . I guess the location shooting captures a particular time and place rather well , though for a college in session it looks really underpopulated . I like Burt as a nobody watchman instead of an important muck-a-muck in the justice system . He looks so terribly humble in that shabby uniform . And I kind of like its lack of pretension . Better a crime thriller that knows its limits than a failed attempt at significance .
441678	819382	470929	6.0	The Mystery of the Severed Ears .	This is a fantasy , a mosaic made out of three complementary sets of tesserae . We have the " biographer " Selden ( Tim McInnerny ) whose assignment is to try to dig up any links between Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle ( Douglas Henshall ) and his fictional creation , the detective Sherlock Holmes , although it is agreed that any results will not be published . There are also contemporary episodes from which Selden is excluded , for good reason . These include a couple of women - - Doyle's own devoted wife and a knockout babe he would like to disarticulate with his tongue . And then there are flashbacks to Conan-Doyle's own earlier years , including his medical tutelage at Edinburgh under Doctor Joseph Bell ( Bryan Cox ) . The three sets of episodes are woven together in a way that is sometimes confusing , the way a dream is confusing , but gradually revealing , until , by the end , all is explained . Or almost all . I didn't get the recurring images of the severed ears crawling with maggots . Okay - - " The Cardboard Box . " But why is this image repeated ? Why is it IN there in the first place ? I missed the first few minutes and perhaps the answer lies there , though I can't imagine how . Of course I could speculate , but it is always dangerous to theorize before one is in possession of all the relevant facts . The most interesting moments - - not necessarily the most dramatic - - are when Dr . Bell pulls of one of those stunts that were later to become inferential staples of the Holmes character . Given a watch to examine , a watch that has been owned by a perfect stranger , Bell complains that the watch has recently been cleaned and this robs him of his most important clues to the owner's character , so he can only say that the man was careless , came from a good family but found his fortunes drop , punctuated by intervals of prosperity , that in later life his habits declined , probably because of drink , and that he had a penchant for 17-year-old blonds all his life . ( I made that last one up . ) Conan-Doyle must have represented one of the last twitches of the Scottish enlightenment that enthroned reason and empiricism , because when he was old , after he'd lost a son in the war , Conan-Doyle turned to mysticism and the séances that were fashionable at the time . The mystery that is investigated in some detail is the reason why Conan-Doyle decided to " kill " his creation , Sherlock Holmes , at a time when Holmes was probably the most famous fictional character in the world , much as Brittany Spears is now . I failed to catch any big reveal towards the end , but at the climax Conan-Doyle resurrects his detective and they march off together into the sunlight . If the viewer is left still a little mystified , evidently Conan-Doyle wasn't , and that's what counts . However , the detective figure that is Holmes in the last few shots on the Great Grimpen Mire is not by any definition Sherlock . It is MYCROFT Holmes that we see . Who's kidding whom around here ? It's an inexpensive production from the BBC and it's about an interesting guy , Conan-Doyle . He was at his peak during the Jack-the-Ripper murders in 1875 . Too bad he didn't tackle Saucy Jack . Of course Conan-Doyle can't be counted among the world's most graceful prose artists . On a dark and stormy night , " the wind sobbed like a child in the chimney . " ( How did the child get into the chimney ? ) And , true , our introduction to Holmes , in " A Study in Scarlet " , makes him look an awful lot like Poe's August Dupin in " The Murders in the Rue Morgue . " But what does that matter ? Conan-Doyle ground out these entertaining mysteries with sprezzatura , hiding his art by making it look so easy , and he gave us some deathless lines . " The curious incident of the dog in the night . " " She was always THE woman . " And , " Quick , Watson , the needle . " ( Well , he never said exactly that , but , again , so what ? ) You may have to be in the right mood to watch this . It's rather slow . But it's a must-see for the Irregulars .
443179	819382	47542	6.0	Inexpensive , unprepossessing thriller .	Basically it's a B movie script that is slightly elevated in significance by the fact that the intended victim is the President of the United States instead of , say , an anonymous guy with his face down on the bar of some tavern in Bloomfield , New Jersey . The fact that is stars Frank Sinatra along with Sterling Hayden and a couple of reliable utility players doesn't change things . The year before , Sinatra had won an Academy Award for his ( very good ) performance in " From Here to Eternity , " rescuing his career from its downward spiral . He wanted the role of the gun-crazy assassin in " Suddenly " because he wanted to demonstrate his range as an actor . And the director gives him every chance . In more than one scene , Sinatra begins a monologue and , turning from the others , stalks towards the camera until he delivers his punch line , his face - - distorted by the wide-angle lens - - twisted with some demonic passion . Well , he does his best but the role is so limited and the dialog so clumsy that nobody could overcome those limitations . Actually , his most effective moment - - and again , it's good - - takes place near the beginning , when Willis Bouchey , a Secret Service agent , enters the house and is introduced to Sinatra's fake FBI man . Bouchey realizes it's a set up , and Sinatra knows that he twigs it . And the camera holds on Sinatra's lunatic smile and such an exopthalmic stare as to suggest he is being taken by thyrotoxic storm , just before he pulls his pistol and plugs Bouchey . In that scene , Sinatra has no dialog at all and it's for the best . Who wrote this thing anyway ? I've seen the movie a few times before but only just now realized how utterly corny the dialog is , even for its time . " Todd , what in Hades is going on in this town anyway ? Did some galoot strike a uranium mine or something ? " " Ellen , will you please stop being such a WOMAN ? " I swear I'm not making that up - - and there's worse . Most of the characters are familiar stereotypes . Sinatra's is intended to be the most complex role , and it is complex compared to the others , but in fact isn't too complicated for a Saturday-afternoon audience to grasp in a few minutes . Sinatra was a nobody until he found his place in the infantry , killing Germans and winning a Silver Star , until he was booted out for some outrage we can only imagine . He did however learn a trade in the Army and has now set out to be all he can be . Sinatra did make a few good movies . He gave this one his best effort . " From Here to Eternity " was fine , and " The Manchurian Candidate " was quite good . In all of them he played someone other than Frank Sinatra , whereas in something like " Tony Rome " he seemed to be on vacation . But here , the script and direction make any plaudits insupportable . It would be enough to make you feel sorry for Frank Sinatra if he were anyone but Frank Sinatra . One wonders if he and Sterling Hayden , the Mount Rushmore of bulk , reminisced about the old days back in Montclair and Hoboken , where each grew up , only a few miles from one another .
442991	819382	80474	6.0	New Broom Exposes Dirt .	A thoughtful film , it is also sprinkled with all sorts of features designed to increase its box-office appeal . Redford is Brubaker , the new reform warden who enters the prison in the guise of a prisoner in order to get a worm's eye view of the goings on . ( They're pretty crummy , what with patients having to pay for their own medical care from a corrupt doctor , insurance premiums paid to cover non-existent tractors but not collapsing roofs . ) After ten or fifteen minutes he reveals his true identity and begins snapping out orders and cleaning things up . At this point it's rather like Superman emerging from the phone booth that Clark Kent entered , or Destry finally picking up a gun . But Redford learns that prisons , like wars , must operate within political constraints . He is told of a field full of buried bodies and begins to dig them up , despite the entreaties of his political friends and advisers , who try to talk him out of it or buy him off with the prison improvements he's been fighting for . It's not even clear that the bodies have been illegally buried , much less murdered as he suspects . The place used to be a pauper's graveyard , he's told . But nothing will wreck a reform agenda faster than zealotry . Before you can say Reign of Terror , Redford is relieved of his job and is driven away - - to the sad but appreciative applause of the prisoners he's leaving behind . That should leave the viewer uplifted alright . What a complicated and dynamic place a prison must be to be properly run . Some of the inmates have been railroaded but most of them have been ( or have become ) the cold-blooded psychopaths they're so often labeled . A warden must walk a tightrope between seeing that the men are treated decently but not given Jacuzzis . Redford , as it turns out , has pretty good balance in this regard , but if he were really concerned about getting his job done he would have compromised and stopped digging quite so hard . Nice cast of supporting players . Jane Alexander is always good . Matt Clark is effectively devious as Redford's clerk ( he's about the only inmate who can read and write ) who participates in the murder of a helpless and naive old prisoner . Redford is about as authoritative as he can be in his minimalist way . He's not George C . Scott playing Patton . The movie rolls along smoothly and takes us with it . We WANT Redford to succeed . But the box-office stuff just doesn't ring true . The sudden emergence of Redford's latent identity as the warden , a shootout with shotguns resulting in two deaths , the inmates applauding and whistling for the disgraced warden as he leaves . It detracts from the more important story and leaves us happy but with an armful of unanswered questions . ( Just who ARE those guys buried on prison property ? ) The inmates may now " respect themselves as human beings " , as Redford claims , but how long will it take the new replacement warden to reduce them to their original rags and despondency ? I wish it had been better , though it's involving enough . It was directed by Stuart Rosenberg who injected a lot more life into Don Pearce's " Cool Hand Luke . " Pearce , by the way , like Warden Brubaker , was a true original .
443315	819382	381505	6.0	Caligian Teen Comedy	It's better than it has a right to be . Kimberley Joyce ( Wood ) with " the face of an angel " persuades two of her classmates to sue for sexual advances a disliked English and Drama teacher at their elite high school , so that his reputation is ruined ( even if they lose , as Wood figures out ) and they achieve an early boost in their career goals as actresses . It's pretty witty in a teen-age comedy kind of way but rather murkier . " All it takes to become an actress is beauty , talent , and the willingness to sleep with somebody you otherwise wouldn't . " And : " Listen to me carefully . ( Silence ) That's the sound of me not caring . " And Wood's father ( James Woods ) having his filthy phone conversation interrupted when his wife walks in , and being forced to improvise a harmless conversation . " Yeah , yeah . Okay , Heshie . Shalom . Right , I'll see you at , uhh , at the mezzuzah . " The direction , the editing , and the innovative musical score all combine to give a further gloss to the performers and the script . Elitism , wealth , adolescent jealousy , publicity seeking , shallow beauty , a lack of morals , selfishness , the media , air headed ambition , reckless parents , the law , political correctness , homosexual intrigue - - all are pinned to the board with the precision of a dead butterfly . But , man , it's dark . One of the three girls , having brought shame to her strict , devout Palestinian immigrant family , shoots herself , leaving a message behind on the chalk board : " We are all sinners , " in Arabic . No one emerges from the plot unsinged . And the reason for it all ? Here the movie falls apart , during the last few minutes . It switches from a critique of our values to a more traditional tale with Wood the evil mastermind who plotted everyone's doom . " The world is an orchestra and I feel like the conductor . " There's no nudity in the film , but it's pretty raunchy . The dialog is vulgar too . " I'd guess that munching underage rug is a good way to get fired . " But much of the wit depends exactly on that sexuality and vulgarity . These are three fifteen-year-old girls , barely out of their adolescent growth spurt , and they know ALL ABOUT IT . It's scary . They know more about it than I knew when I was - - well , let's see - - when I was SIXteen ! They've managed to pass from being innocent to being jaded without ever having gone through any period of florescence . They are so clever . Asked to explain a loud anti-Semitic remark ( " At least my father isn't a money-grubbing shyster Jew lawyer ! " ) , Wood looks remorseful and says , " My father is a racist . I guess I picked it up at home . " Her interrogator nods his head - - " It always starts with the parents . " I had to listen carefully because she has a tendency to speak in hasty bursts with a valley accent , like a small motorcycle revving up or a German MG42 firing . All kinds of inconvenient phonemes are eleded . " I still feel bad " comes out as " I stuffle bed . " Wood is a beautiful young woman , of course , but although James Woods has a small role I think it may be his best film performance to date . He is hilarious , whether exploding with anger or squirming , but it sounds utterly believable . He has a theory that his new Jewish colleagues are sending signals in Yiddish to one another and disguising them as coughing spells - - and he gives a side-splitting imitation . The movie , alas , loses its grip at the end and goes for pathos . The movie isn't aimed only at teenagers , thank God , although they'll probably like it and find at least some of it familiar . But they'll mostly miss some of the film's points , like the characters themselves , which attuned adults will not . Kind of a cross between " Clueless " and " Heathers . "
442045	819382	53351	6.0	Heroism and Cowardice .	This is one of those perilous journey semi-Westerns . In 1916 , Major Gary Cooper is the awards officer during the pursuit of Pancho Villa into Mexico . After witnessing two battles he recommends five men for the Congressional Medal of Honor - - enlisted men Michael Callan , Richard Conte , Van Heflin , and Dick York ; and a lieutenant , Tab Hunter . The commanding officer , Robert Keith , tries to wheedle the same decoration out of Cooper but Cooper declines . The angry Keith orders Cooper to take his five heroes to the distant base at Cordura , and while he's at it he can take Rita Hayworth too . She's been harboring Villistas at her desert ranch . The merry group sets out on the forty-mile journey . It soon becomes apparent that the men aren't all that Cooper thought they were . They're jealous , vain , half loony , coarse , spiteful , self-pitying , and murderous . Even the other officer , Tab Hunter , sides with them . None of them wants the medal . The hatred of Cooper becomes more intense when they discover that during Villa's raid into Columbus , New Mexico , the major hid out in a ditch . Rita Hayworth , on the other hand , who starts out as a self-indulgent alcoholic , proves herself insightful , generous , and stalwart . With the other men refusing to help , Cooper drives himself to exhaustion and near death before the base at Cordura is sighted . The visuals are magnificent . The film was shot near St . George , in the red rock country near the four corners region of the Southwest . It's all piles of pink and gray sedimentary boulders with scattered juniper and pinion pine . When the detail comes upon an abandoned railway speeder , one of those contraptions on rails that must be operated by two men lifting and pushing down on handles , despite the gloomy tonus , one can hardly help but wish to join them on their journey through the Pinesol-scented air of someplace clean . Fascinating , too , to see what is essentially a Western played out in olive drab uniforms and . 45 automatics and field caps that look as if they came straight out of an ancient Boy Scout manual . Alas , the effort is undercut by a banal and sometimes incomprehensible script . The dialog is sometimes stylized but it comes across not as poetic but as clumsy . Cooper mutters things like , " Got to go on . Can't give up . " Not even Hemingway would have dared to suggest a man would drop those pronouns because he was too tired to pronounce them . There is some bloated talk about having acted " beyond the limits of human endurance . " Nobody can do that . If you cross the limits of human endurance , then the limits were in the wrong place to begin with . The director , Robert Rossen , has done better work elsewhere - - " All the King's Men , " for instance , or " The Hustler . " At one point , after some of her cup of tequila has been used to tend a wounded and despised Richard Conte , the canteen cup is handed back to her , half full . She lifts it shoulder high before slowly and dramatically pouring it onto the sand . That gesture belongs in an Italian opera . And the acting varies from the very good indeed ( Van Heflin , who manages to believably conquer his villainous lines ) through the disappointing ( Tab Hunter trying out his acting chops in the role of a heavy instead of a glamor boy ) , to the almost unbearable - - Rita Hayworth acts by the numbers , showing only rudimentary talent . She can't even play a convincing drunk . And when she is pushing the railway speeder , her idea of demonstrating fatigue is to drag the pointed toe of her trailing boot in the gravel . Anyone , no matter how played out , who has ever shoved a burden must wince at her ineptitude . The first half of the story is engrossing . The last half deteriorates , and at the ending the movie collapses entirely and just gives up . All along , the men have given reasons why they don't want the medals and why they resent Cooper enough to kill him . Not all the reasons for rejecting the decoration are plausible - - Richard Conte , for example , " don't hanker to be made no lead mule . " But his character would have grabbed at the chance to make " an extra two bucks a month . " At any rate , Cooper finally collapses while trying to haul the speeder single-handedly and the machine rolls backward , dragging Cooper face down through the gravel for fifty yards . The men now have the hated major at their disposal and Tab Hunter is about to administer the coup de gras . Before the trigger is pulled , the men read Cooper's formal description of his recommendations and undergo an epiphany . At the same time , Cordura is sighted just over the hill . Everyone climbs to his or her feet and marches off towards base accompanied by triumphant music . The moral is that no man is either entirely heroic or entirely cowardly . We all must overcome our tendency to think categorically . We're all a mixture of good impulses and bad impulses . Try to remember that , will you ? Otherwise you expect too much of people , or too little of people , including yourself . I just spelled out in one paragraph what this movie takes an adventurous and beautiful hour and a half to tell us .
441829	819382	118586	7.0	Grappling With Hormones .	Alison Folland is a young woman in a shabby section of New York who , after a tempestuous friendship with blond , impatient Tara Subkoff , and the murder of her gay buddy Luke , comes to terms with her own lesbianism and finds a happy and accommodating partner in Lucy , a band leader in a place that looks like the Swing Rendezvous in the Village used to look . Maybe that makes it sound more complicated than it is . It's really a rather simple movie , a little pedantic , a delicate character study rather than a mystery or action movie . Roughly speaking , all the gays are good and all the straight people are messed up . That's not too hard to follow , is it ? Well , there are a couple of exceptions , but not many . Don , the Italian owner of the pizza restaurant where Alison and a gay guy both work , is straight but sympathetic . He's briefly in about four scenes . But it's hard to care about Don's character one way or the other because he serves up these GREAT pizzas ( we only get a glimpse but can practically smell it ) that make Domino's and Pizza Hut look like impostors . Try to get a pizza like that at four in the morning in northern Scotland ! The rest of the straight guys are represented by the boyfriend of Alison's mother , who , in the absence of the mother , begins dangling his insinuations in front of the girl herself , who looks about 16 . The straight adolescent goons who ball Subkoff when they feel like it and throw her out when they're bored with her are little more than perambulating pustules . Folland plays a dumpy adolescent who is shy but sensitive . In fact , however , she has a splendid face with modelesque features , fey and pixie-like . Her bone structure is pretty big though and , alas , the configuration of her weight suggests a strong genetic component . There won't be much she'll be able to do about it . It shouldn't matter , but it always does . Subkoff , her inconstant adolescent friend , has a more conventional and rather skinny figure but her voice , features , and demeanor are coarser than Folland's . She looks like Buffy the Vampire Slayer if Buffy were the vampire instead of the slayer . She has probably the most demanding role in the film and brings it off marvelously , a complex character very nicely rendered . The photography and location shooting are just fine . And the movie does middle-class urban dwellers a big favor . You know those young chicks you see on the streets ? The ones with violently pink hair done up in a fashion resembling a tangled mop ? The ones with maybe a jail-house tat around their biceps ? With their clothes half drooping off and that silver ring dangling from their pipiks ? Well , only some of them are dangerous stoners . Many of them are just playing with their appearance , as adolescents are want to do in all cultures , and they may be a little thoughtless but fundamentally decent people . I'd watch out for the guys though , especially if they're straight . They have a slight tendency to murder people they find offensive . At least that's what the film suggests .
442601	819382	50613	7.0	Macbeth-san .	Okay , the warriors Washizu and Miki ride back from a victorious battle through a magic forest and run into a wispy specter that tells them that Washizu will become king while Miki's son will inherit the kingdom . Coaxed by his wife , Washizu assassinates the king and takes his place . Again coaxed by his wife , he has his friend Miki killed as well . Well , Washizu ( Toshiro Mifune ) has made a lot of enemies by this time and they gang up on him , attack his castle , and kill him - - whereupon Miki's son takes the throne , thus fulfilling the prophecy . That's it , in brief . Can I skip the rest of the plot ? Read Shakespeare's MacBeth for the whole story . It's one of my favorite plays by WS , partly because it's the shortest that he ever wrote . I was led to believe Kurosawa's version of the tale deviated considerably from Shakespeare's and that it might be almost unrecognizable , but that's not the case at all . It's far from a filmed play , of course . In the play we only hear about the woods creeping up on the castle . Here we see the Spider Web Forest in full creepy motion . And if MacBeth is finally killed off stage by Duncan , here Washizu winds up with more arrows sticking out of him than a porcupine has quills . And of course Shakespeare's poetry is missing . Or , let's say , whereas Shakespeare's poetry was verbal , Kurosawa's is visual . And what a visual delight it is too , in inexpensive black and white , full frame . A terrific use of fog , lighting , spare sets , minimalistic acting punctuated by outrageous ham . Toshiro Mifune overacts to the extent that , at certain points , it becomes a miracle that his eyeballs stay in their sockets . There are , however , some differences . I think the editing might be off , or else I missed the part where Washizu gives the order for Miki to be killed . ( They bring Washizu Miki's lopped off head , missing in the play . ) If I remember , Madam MacBeth doesn't become pregnant and have a stillborn child either , as Washizu's wife does here . Also , in the play , she dies for reasons unexplained . Here , she seems to just disappear from the story , like the Fool in King Lear , unless I looked away from the screen at the wrong moment and missed some subtitles . ( Just listening to it is no help because I only understand a few words of Japanese and all of them are unprintable . ) " Is this a dagger that I see before me ? " is missing , naturally , but the Banquo's Ghost scene is kept just about intact . It includes the intrusion of Washizu's wife , trying to explain to the guests that her husband sometimes has these fits and spells when he's liquored up . ( How many ordinary wives have made the same apologies for their ordinary husbands ? ) But Washizu's wife does more than try to patch over her husband's gaffes . In the play , she merely propped up her husband when his ambition weakened , urged him to " screw your courage to the sticking place . " In Kurosawa's film , she's the INSTIGATOR of the whole thing . She's truly Machiavellian . Next to her , Washizu is a guileless moron who takes too much for granted and is too dumb to concoct her kinds of intrigues . Her emoting throughout is highly stylized and seems somehow artificial to Western eyes , but probably more accessible to those Japanese who are in the noh . I admit I found myself a little confused now and then . Especially during the first half , I couldn't keep the Lord's Castle , the Garrison , and the First , Second , and Third Fortresses straight . The play dealt mostly with titles - - the Glames or the Glans or whatever they were - - but in the film , the prizes are places as well as titles . It's a dark film , darker than the play that begat it . The three witches with their bubbling cauldron seem to be figures of fun , but the spectral old man who sings a tale of life is positively depressing , though spookier than the witches . The imagery in this scene is really notable . I keep hearing that Kurosawa was influenced by John Ford but it's hard to see how . Kurosawa was attracted to umberous , humorless stories . Ford rarely went without a dance or celebration of some sort . And Kurosawa tried suicide , whereas Ford was never in any such danger except for maybe drinking himself to death . I wonder if it had anything to do with Kurosawa's having fought on the losing side of a war and Ford's having been on the winning side . In any case , don't miss this .
442568	819382	28333	7.0	Hard Work and Talent Pay Off .	Fred Astaire's character , Lucky , may depend on the turn of a card or the spin of a roulette wheel to decide his fate but Fred Astaire did not . He and Ginger Rogers , whom he pursues here as usual through several contretemps , put in an enormous amount of work . Astaire insisted that there be few cuts during the dance numbers . Thus , for instance , when Astair and Rogers launch into " Waltz in Swing Time , " which requires especially heroic effort from Rogers , the whole intricate number isn't cut at all . This technique naturally involved multiple takes . In the case of " Never Gonna Dance , " towards the end , forty-seven takes were required . Imagine . You can put yourself through three or four minutes of strenuous , thoroughly memorized dance steps , after hundreds of hours of planning and rehearsal , flub the last step , and you have to start all over again . Whatever they were paying Astaire and Rogers , it was hardly enough . The film gets off to a bit of a slow start . There is some fluff about whether Astaire's pants should have cuffs or not . The Grip Quotient remains the same through the rest of the film , which is to say we're not dealing with " Citizen Kane " here . And the editing . Somewhere along the time line Astaire must have promised Rogers that he would quit gambling because , when she finds him apparently betting on cards , it leads to their third ( or is it fourth ? ) breakup . The scene in which Astaire makes the promise , however , never made it into the final cut . No matter . It's the musical numbers that count and these are about as good as they come . The tunes are by Jerome Kern ( one of them won an Academy Award ) and the often amusing and sometimes touching lyrics are by Dorothy Fields . Some of the songs are likely to be familiar . Pick Yourself Up , Dust Yourself Off , and Start All Over Again . A Fine Romance , With No Kisses . Just the Way You Look Tonight . Others may not have entered the national songbook but are spectacular in their own right . I cannot imagine anyone but Astaire doing that frenetic " Bojangles " number in one three-and-a-half minute take without cuts . I don't mean just because it was flawless . I mean I can't imagine anyone doing it without inviting an acute infraction of the myoculinary , flopping all over the place like a marionette being flung about by some puppeteer on crystal meth . Most people could make a thousand mistakes trying to do it and still drop dead of a heart attack . That number , by the way , is done in blackface , a sorry tradition left over from minstrel shows . But this number was staged ( and designed ) as a tribute to a specific performer , Bill " Bojangles " Robinson , a popular dancer of the 1930s who appeared in several movies , including one or two with Shirley Temple , and Astaire's make-up avoids the crudity of the usual blackface , which even Bert Williams , an African-American himself , needed to wear during his numbers . Thoroughly enjoyable - - or almost . You get a pass if you nod out during some of the " comic " interludes featuring Victor Moore .
442853	819382	455584	7.0	Thoughtful and Suspenseful Mystery .	It's a complicated plot . David Kelly , as Frank Kovak , is an ancient and brilliant scientist who has invented a kind of chip that can be implanted in an unsuspecting victim's neck . He's had this done more than a hundred times and all these unknowing subjects are walking around on Mallorca , the tourist mecca in Spain's Balearic Islands . The chips can be activated when the subject hears Billy Holiday singing " Gloomy Sunday . " When they are activated , the subject commits suicide . Any attempt to tinker with the chips sets them off . De rigeur in these kinds of stories . This happens to the bride of David Norton ( Timothy Hutton ) . She jumps from a hotel balcony and splashes . In fact , there is a rash of similarly motivated suicides on Mallorca and the despondent Hutton runs into another jumper ( Lucia Jimenez ) who survives only because her fall was broken by an awning . The two join forces and Hutton , a successful science fiction writer , finally tracks down the malefactor , Kelly , who nevertheless succeeds in prompting about a hundred people to leap to their deaths in The Caves of Hell on the island . Kelly is dying of a brain tumor and tries to blackmail Hutton into shooting him . He succeeds after threatening to reactivate Jimenez's chip so that she'll off herself successfully . It's a perplexing movie . A good deal of imagination has obviously gone into the plot , which hangs together nicely . Except , I suppose , once the conundrum is clarified , all the potential victims need to do is to make sure they're never in a position to listen to Billy Sunday again . ( Jimenez , when hearing the tuneful trigger , manages to stay under water long enough to escape the consequences . ) It's slow and there's little in the way of action but I rather liked it . Frank Kovac is the evildoer , of course , but he's so wizened and he sounds so sweet that it's difficult to categorize him as thoroughly evil . He is , after all , a sick and dying human being who is facing what remains of his bleak future with dignity and without complaint . It's so much better than casting some tattooed moron as the heavy . Timothy Hutton gives a subdued performance , projecting the presence of a man whose would-be wife has recently done a nose dive off a hotel balcony . Lucia Jimenez is there primarily to provide a threatened female . ( She and Hutton both know she's sporting one of those chips in her neck . ) She does a professional job , though , and she has sensual features and a nice figure , so we'll let her stay in the picture and be threatened . She does NOT wind up in bed with Hutton , or together with him on the departing airplane either , which is a blessing because the alternative is a terrible cliché . The spare musical score by Roque Banos is mysterioso - - somber and spooky . The director may need a little seasoning . The movie has no touches that anyone would consider out of the ordinary . Not that every film MUST be full of directorial razzle-dazzle . But let me give one example of what I mean . Hutton and Jimenez have discovered the secret to the rash of suicides and have come into possession of records that support their conclusion . They take them to the American embassy . The men on the other side of the desk do what these movies always require of them - - they don't believe a word of it . So how does the director handle this formulaic situation ? Not like Hitchcock did in " The Man Who Knew Too Much " , and not like Roman Polanski in " Frantic . " Instead , after the evidence is presented , the Consul shakes his head and smirks while denying that it constitutes proof or , indeed , anything suggestive enough to be worth pursuing . It's as if Hutton and Jimenez were two nuts . The stereotypic template is followed down to the last millimeter . But you can easily get over these occasional directorial vacations - - the cross-cutting between the people about to leap to their doom and the car speeding to their rescue . The plot's the thing . And it's not bad .
442518	819382	151804	7.0	Bartleby the Nerd .	I was called away and missed the last half or so of the film , except for the final few minutes , so I can't judge accurately how nearly the film fulfilled the promise of his first 40 minutes . But it was coming along very well indeed . Ron Livingston , who works with a computer in a cubicle , just like everyone else in his office , is dominated by the suavely domineering boss , Gary Cole . Boy , is Livingston sick of his job . He sees a hypnotherapist for some temporary relief . After inducing the trance and telling Livingston he will no longer worry about what happens , and before being able to tweak the post-hypnotic suggestions , the therapist drops dead and leaves Livingston in a permanent go-to-hell mood that even has him smiling benignly at the therapist's fallen body . Two investigators come to downsize the company and Livingston is in the land of Cockaigne . He is the only worker to tell them the flat-out truth . He doesn't give a damn about his work because the job is stupid and he's not motivated . The visiting execs take him for a brutally frank and perceptive subordinate . He's promoted . Livingston has the talent and , equally important , the right comic face for the role . He's a presentable-enough young man but his jaw is slightly large for the rest of his features and it lends him a dumb appearance . So far , so familiar . The guy who is somehow altered by circumstances so that he refuses to conform , is taken as a non-paradigmatic genius by others , and is subject to many comic situations . Just offhand , I'm thinking of a " Twilight Zone " episode with Jack Carson , Peter Sellers in " Being There " , a desperate Jim Carrey comedy . And , boy , there is hardly any more unpromising material to make a funny movie out of than a sterile office . " Bartleby " was able to do it . " Office Space " might have fallen flat on its face once it got past the first couple of funny scenes because , after all , unless there is talented writing behind the plot , a sense of progression , what you're left with is a single joke . I'd like to think this one did better than that , that it hit its mark . The morning after his transformation , a Saturday that Livingston has been ordered to spend at work , he shuts off the alarm , ignores his boss's phone calls , and sleeps until the afternoon while some vibes on the score give us a gentle and beautifully syncopated rendering of " Beautiful Dreamer . " The writers did more than just rob Livingston of his ability to pretend he cared . Jennifer Aniston has some comic moments with her boss too , and her uniform . She's a waitress in one of those " cute " chain restaurants like Chili's and she's required to wear a minimum of 35 buttons ( " flair " ) on her uniform . The buttons are incredibly vulgar - - pictures of Garfield and whatnot . Her boss earnestly talks to her about her flair . She protests that she's wearing the required number of buttons . Yes , but 35 is the MINIMUM number of flairs . Chester over there is wearing FIFTY-TWO flairs . So she'd better shape up . And Steven Root is sublime as Livingston's co-worker whose desk is always being moved ( four times in one day ) and whose Swingline stapler is always being snatched away by Gary Cole , leaving Root only a Boston stapler . I hope the film as a whole measured up to the part of it that I was able to catch . I'm looking forward to seeing Act II when I can .
443041	819382	69919	7.0	Light-hearted NYC heist flick .	It's a pretty dumb title - - " Cops and Robbers . " Sounds as if it ought to be a gritty urban crime tale starring maybe Steven Segal . Instead it's a good-natured look at two ordinary New York City cops who are tired of the violence and selfishness they see on the job , the greed and perspiration . They dream about getting their share of the goods too so that one of them ( Cliff Gorman ) can take his family to Bermuda and the other ( Joseph Bologna ) can become a farmer in Saskatchewan . The cops contact a mafioso ( John Ryan ) and tell him they want to get out , and they plan on doing it by stealing something and selling it to him for disposal . " What do you plan to steal ? " asks Ryan . " Whatever you'll pay two million dollars for , " replies Gorman . So they stage a robbery along lines suggested by Ryan , robbing an investment firm of ten million dollars worth of bearer bonds . The man who runs the firm , Mr . Eastpool ( Shephard Strudwick ) and his secretary ( Ellen Holly , a dish ) cooperate fully - - and for good reason . Afterward they claim TWELVE million was stolen , stealing the extra two million for themselves . " One million apiece ! " Bologna exclaims in disgust . The two don't actually steal anything because they are forced by circumstances to destroy the bonds . But they cheat Ryan out of the two million he agreed to pay , and the film ends with the pair lazing in the back yard of their modest home , smiling and gazing contentedly at an airliner way up there in the sky . The amusement is tempered with a good deal of suspense before and after the robbery as the usual things go wrong and reality intrusions occur . Gorman and Bologna work well together , the former slightly wall eyed and a little insane , the latter cherubic and frightened . In their false mustaches , each looks a little like Groucho Marx . Strudwick and Holly are better than simply good enough , too . Much of the credit must go to the director , Aram Avakian , watching whose documentary , " Jazz on a Summer's Day , " was almost as good as being there . Avakian gets a lot of smiles out of events in long shot . ( The kids might not get it . ) Example : Ryan is having his record typed up for an interview in the police station , looking very very Italian . " What's your name ? " asks the cop tonelessly from behind the desk . " Patsy O'Neal , " replies the smiling Ryan easily . The cop doesn't bat an eye as he types in , " Anielli , Pasquale . " Well , another example , because that last one didn't involve a long shot . A half dozen mafia types wearing shades and flowered shirts are leaning against the wall in front of a high mafioso's headquarters when Ryan's long limousine pulls up . Ryan sits patiently in the car while the armed goons spread out in a circle , like the Praetorian Guard , hands fondling the guns packed into their belts , eyes searching for enemies . Nothing much is made of it but the scene is quite funny . I won't describe any of the other amusing scenes except to say that you have to look for them . The comedy is effective but not outrageous . Nobody falls on his behind , and after the first few minutes there is no shooting . Easy going and diverting film , worth watching .
442074	819382	67778	7.0	Breaking taboos .	A French film about the relationship between a teen-aged boy ( Ferreux ) and his mother ( Massari ) . Well , I guess more generally it is about Ferreux ' coming of age , a kind of Bildungsfilm , because other characters play a part in his development - - a girl his age , a priest and tutor , and so forth . Ferreux and Massari are a little closer , a little more playful together than a boy and his mother should be , and there are little warnings along the way that his budding sexuality is budding in what most people would consider not quite the right direction . The bud bursts into bloom at the end but nobody seems to care very much . Massari says it was a sacred and secret moment but will never happen again . And one supposes that afterward Ferreux takes off after that winsome blonde of his own age rather than rifling through his mother's underwear . The performances are fine . Man , Ferreux looks as if he might have grown into that English actor who played James Whale in " Gods and Monsters " but whose name escapes me . It will come to me sooner or later but too late to use it here . The story of my life - - we'll call it " Plus Tarde . " He's a pretty good actor for such a young kid . Totally natural , though a bit serious . Listens to Charlie Parker , of whom we hear a few shards during the story . Whew , what blistering runs , what genius . Lea Massari is just about the right age and temperament for her role . She was a lot more dangerous before she disappeared in " L'Avventura , " with her fulgurating sexuality . Here she's matter of fact about things , candid in her discussions with her son , clips his toe nails for him , sings happily while accompanying herself on the guitar , shrugs everything off . I think this is called " savoir-faire " . It's kind of like having a constitutional Prozac-generator . She's just old enough for the part but has lost none of her foxy edge . The priest senses something may be a little bent but his warning hints go unregarded . There are no moments of high drama . Nobody seems to worry too much about anything . Maybe it's the Dijon mustard in their diet , but whatever it is we should all have more of it . A genuinely good-natured movie about taking things just seriously enough - - not too little and not too much . Bird plays under the closing credits , a thoroughly apt petit cadeau . Enjoy it .
442713	819382	47264	7.0	A Man Gets Lonesome . . . .	I wish I could pin down exactly what it is that makes Charlton Heston's walk so distinctive , but I guess it may not be unique . He walks like a lot of tall men - - Henry Fonda , John Wayne , Clint Eastwood . There's a certain seven-league-boots quality to their slow strides . Just the opposite of Joe Pesci , Mickey Rooney , Charlie Chaplin , and Danny DeVito , who always seem to be rushing somewhere . Come to think of it , though , Alan Ladd didn't seem to be in a big hurry . Maybe he wasn't short enough . Anyway a tall man's step bespeaks self confidence . Okay . Now take Charlton Heston , a tall , broad-shouldered , deep-voiced kind of guy with a face hewn out of marble or maybe a mountainside , dress him in leather boots and riding breeches , strap a gun around his waist , decorate his neck with a casual scarf , top him with something that looks like a cowboy hat , make him a rich and powerful plantation owner somewhere in the middle of the Amazon basin , and you've got every woman's dream . At any rate , Eleanor Parker found it appealing enough to marry Heston's Leiningen sight unseen , as a mail-order bride who comes to his empire . I'm surprised they kept the name Leiningen from the original story because the usual tactic is to turn the hero's name into something like Steele ( it was good enough for Stalin ) , Armstrong , Masters , or something equally suggestive and simple . Leiningen is three syllables long . One can imagine the producers wringing their hands over whether an American audience would find that congeries of alien-looking consonants and vowels too hard to chew on . " LEAN-again " ? ? ? Vladimir Nabokov had the same problem when he tried to market his memoirs under the title , " Speak , Mnemosene . " Well , never mind all that . The movie is divided into two parts , like the USA today . First part - - the arrival of Heston's bride and her introduction to life on the old plantation , complete with the usual staff of slaves , servants , headshrinkers , wise Jivaro elders , and whatnot . Second part - - the arrival of the irresistible army ants ( " maribunta " - - always spoken in a hushed voice saturated with awe ) . The first part is hilarious and the second part is thrilling . Overall it's a very diverting film . The dialog between Heston and Parker will induce spasms of laughter . Heston is disappointed - - no , MORE than disappointed - - to find that Parker has been married before , and you know what that means ! " The piano is a little out of tune , " Parker comments after playing a tune . " That piano is brand new . I only have things shipped to me that are new . The piano has never been USED before . " Angrily , Parker tells him that obviously he doesn't know much about music because if he did he'd know that a piano is BETTER after it's been PLAYED BEFORE . Heston doesn't have a smart reply for that . Who could ? But as they're sitting silently at the table after dinner , a cockatoo on a perch squawks , Heston turns a sullen face to the bird and says , " Shuddup . " Heston here is a self-made man who worships his creator . Similar gems crop up in Heston's other 1954 jungle movie , " Secrets of the Incas . " Both films share a screenwriter , Ranald MacDougal , who must have laughed himself into a fit . It's helped because Heston plays it perfectly straight , as he does everything . I doubt that in " Ben Hur " he realized that he and Massala had been lovers when they were boys . Not to neglect Part Two , in which Heston decides to stick around and defend his property and Parker stays by his side , but the limits of available space are being nibbled away , so to speak . He uses all sorts of weapons - - fire and water - - but the ants are an unstoppable tide , cutting a swath through the jungle and his plantation is in their way . He escapes with his life but it's a close call , I'll tell you . Whew . En fin , he may lose his colossal empire but he gains a loving wife . We all pray that she continues to love him after she finds out what it's like to be living in the middle of the jungle with some guy who is broke . You miss this one at your own expense . It's really enjoyable .
442202	819382	217363	7.0	WTFU in Cincinatti .	Art can cause a lot of trouble . No doubt about it . In 1913 , a ballet debuted in Paris , " The Rite of Spring , " full of strange rhythms and telling the story of the barbaric sacrifice of a young virgin . The audience included such luminaries as Picasso , Cocteau , Proust , Ravel and Debussy . Some folks liked it , many didn't . There were hisses , boos , and catcalls . Objects were thrown at the stage . Fights broke out . The police were called . And the composer , Stravinsky , and the choreographer , Nijinsky , had to escape out the back way . What that incident and the story shown in this movie have in common is that neither object of community scorn - - not the ballet and not the Mapplethorpe photographs - - were intended to promote social change , nor could they have , even if the artists had wanted them to . The Mapplethorpe exhibit at the Cincinatti gallery wasn't the equivalent of an hysterical call to arms by Commies or Nazis , and nothing like the shout of " fire " in a crowded theater . Yet everyone in the community was divided on the issue . Dennis Barrie , who runs the gallery and booked the exhibit , is played by James Woods , who is better at half-comic loonies than upstanding champions of freedom of speech . Seven of the photos are disturbing enough . Among the pretty flowers with their unfolding petals are the genitalia of human beings , and the abuse of those organs . Some are outright disgusting - - a man urinating in another's mouth . Man , though , does Woods get into trouble . His family gets threatening phone calls at night , his kid is insulted and beaten at school , his wife has to resign from the PTA , none of his neighbors will talk to him , and Woods himself is arrested , brought to trial on obscenity charges , and acquitted . I wasn't expecting much but actually the film isn't that bad . Both positions - - for and against Woods and his exhibit - - are shown , with their expectable fringe elements waving placards and dancing wildly up and down as they shout curses and encouragement . And there are some talking heads - - Barney Frank , William F . Buckley , and Salman Rushdie among them - - who are able to calmly articulate the reasoning behind the emotions displayed by the crowds . Some clichés must be unavoidable in these kinds of films , and they do show up here . The anonymous jury members arguing ( in Canadian accents ) . The family arguments between the rigid husband and the wife ( Diana Scarwid , always good ) who wants it all to just go away . The kids ' troubles at school . The fruitcake calls about going to hell . The good guys with no vices ; the bad guys looking subtly sinister . But the story isn't swamped by them . We stick pretty close to James Woods and his travails . A more serious problem is that the movie presents the issue categorically . Either you're in one camp or the other . And , having done so , the writers and director don't leave us in much doubt about which side they're on . They're on the side of the angels of course . And the movie doesn't get at the problem behind the problem , which isn't " obscenity " but " tolerance . " William F . Buckley makes the point that even if Mapplethorpe's photographs were perfectly executed , there is no obligation to show them to the public . He's absolutely right . Nor does the public have an obligation to view them . The real question is whether we should deny others the right to view them . Photos HAVE prompted social and political change in the past . Think of Mathew Brady's photographs of Confederate dead at Antietam . No one had seriously imagined a Civil War battlefield strewn with hundreds of bloated bodies before . Or Dorothea Lange's photographs of impoverished Okie farmers during the Great Depression , which leveraged Washington into addressing their plight . Or a photo from Vietnam - - half a dozen scorched children running and screaming from a napalmed village , led by a naked young girl with her skin peeling . I would guess that compared to those photos , Mapplethorpe's pictures of fisting and homoeroticism don't pose much of a threat to social stability . Why not tolerate them ? De gustibus non disputandum est . What's going to happen - - the homosexuals are going to rise up en masse and take over the world ? We might be better off for it , as far as that goes . At least we'd all be well dressed . You have to hand it to cable TV for making movies about newsworthy events like this one , even if it comes some years after the event has lost its value as gossip fodder . HBO does it head on , with skill and often wit . And PBS sometimes comes up with startlingly well-done docudramas like " Oppenheimer . " Good for them .
442561	819382	360009	7.0	I'm going to get you out of here . You're going to get me out of here ? I'm going to get you out of here .	I started watching this without knowing any of the credits . As the dialog and the anfractuous plot developed I found myself thinking , " Oh , no ! " It was all so MAMET-LIKE . I assumed that David Mamet had had sufficient critical successes and box office winners that other writers and directors were shamelessly ripping him off and that he would soon be nudged sideways into the cliché-laden zone now occupied by people like Hitchcock and Quentin Tarrantino . Istantly recognizable Schtick . In a few years our ability to suspend disbelief would be lambasted with increasingly involved special ops within cons within special ops , and we would be listening in every movie to dialog like this : Character One : " I'm going to get you out of here . " Character Two : " You're going to get me out of here ? " Character One : " I'm going to get you out of here . " Or : Character One : " You want a cigarette now ? " Character Two : " Can you produce one ? " What a relief to find that David Mamet was behind this whole thing - - writer , producer , director , bricoleur . It may be Schtick , but it's Mamet's own . The plot really IS pretty complicated and sometimes a little hard to follow because of the elliptic dialog . At the same time we can usually judge from the circumstances what it means when somebody says , " You've got to bring me into the tall corn . " It's a little harder to guess what a transponder looks like but we can do that too . It's very hard , though , to understand how even the world's finest shot can with one bullet blow away a moving target on land when the shooter himself is on a bobbing fishing boat half a mile out on the misty ocean - - but let that ( and several other implausibilities ) glide . It's an interesting movie , easy to get swept up in . Val Kilmer is beyond the point of prettiness , happily , and is bulkier and more believable . ( From some angles he reminds one of Mickey Rooney . ) His acting may not shoot out the lights but the role doesn't call for fireworks , just a nicely balanced combination of determination and creativity . I kind of like Bill Macy better in parts that are at least slightly comic . Those goofy features , I suppose . The rest of the performers are at least adequate . The movie was released in 2004 and probably shot in 2003 . The heavies - - aside from those in Washington - - are Arabs , as far as we know . I mean , when you think of Dubai , you think Arabs , no ? Although I doubt that most Americans could go to a map and put their finger on Dubai instead of , say , Qattar , Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , or Yemen - - or Jordan , Syria , or Saudi Arabia for that matter . A survey of high school students a few years ago revealed that the majority thought that Toronto was in Italy . I only mention this because I wonder if this film establishes precedent . Are we to have nothing but Arab terrorists and white slave traders in our future ? Is this a pointed finger that I see before me ? Catch it if you can . Plenty of action - - but it's used as dramatic punctuation rather than a Ding an Sich . It's there for a reason . And the narrative will keep you interested .
441982	819382	71847	7.0	What we escaped from .	This isn't going to be everybody's favorite movie . The production values don't shoot out the lights . All the sets are indoors . There's no motion to speak of . The whole shebang seems static and talky . Yet it's an important document and in some ways well done . If much of the dialog sounds stilted it's because it was taken from official sources . So we get a lot of formal speech and very little in the way of offhand nudges . But the acting , at least in the important roles , is really pretty good . DeVane as JFK , Martin Sheen as his brother Bobby , and Howard DaSilva as Krushchev are outstanding . Most impressive is the way this film takes us back to what now seems almost like a Golden Age , despite the missile crisis and the insanity of Mutual Assured Destruction . It was a time when a president would make certain that the meetings were attended by an old Cold Warrior , Dean Acheson , even though Acheson was presumed to represent a dated point of view and was only a private citizen at the time , because the president wanted to hear all points of view during brainstorming sessions . In discussing those planning sessions , Robert MacNamara describes President Kennedy leaning towards military action in order to save face , and one of the participants saying to him , " Mister President , you're wrong . " ( " That took guts , " says MacNamara in Errol Morris's documentary , " The Fog of War . " ) I was in school at the time of these events and no one knew anything except what was released to the media . If we'd known how close we were to war I believe church attendance would have soared . Many incidents and coincidences came together to get the world out of that tight spot , chief among them the reluctance of both sides to engage in war . Both Krushchev and Kennedy had a pretty good idea of how that worked . JFK had written a book about it . More than that , imagine a president who is able to muse that he recently finished reading Barbara Tuchman's history of the accidental beginning of World War I , " The Guns of August " . " If I could do it , I'd send a copy to every commanding officer aboard the blockading destroyers - - not that they'd read it . " The resolution of the conflict , despite missteps and mistakes on both sides , hinged on a single event . Krushchev , depressed , wrote an ameliorative letter to Kennedy , saying that he understood Kennedy's position , and that he , Krushchev was willing to dismantle the Cuban missiles in return for a guarantee that the USA would neither launch nor aid any invasion of Cuba in the future . ( Using anti-Castro Cubans , we had invaded the island at the Bay of Pigs , which was a miserable failure . ) At last both sides seemed to have what they wanted . The USA was getting rid of the missile threat , and the USSR was getting a guarantee of Cuba's sovereignty . Alas , under political pressure from his " war camp " at home , Krushcheve wrote a second letter , much harder in tone , reneging on earlier proposals and adding demands which the USA could not grant . Two mutually conflicting proposals a day apart . What to do ? What they did was follow Robert Kennedy's suggestion . They ignored the second letter and responded only to the first . More fumbles and confusion followed but the crisis was eventually resolved with both sides compromising , but not in ways that jeopardized their own defenses . The crisis required - - and got - - deft handling at the top and cautious but effective diplomacy . That's why I used the expression " Golden Age " before . As drama , this isn't much . No villains , no fist fights , and not a gun in sight . Yet for its educational value alone , in our somewhat history-shy culture , it ought to be seen by everyone , especially now .
443573	819382	45323	7.0	Robust and unpretentious comedy from Ford .	I can't remember the silent version , which I saw years ago . I think it's probably best known for the fact that the cuss words of Captain Flagg and Sergeant Quirt were clearly discernible , even to viewers without advanced training in lip reading . I have no idea what the original play was like . Ford's version could be described as pointless , energetic , and at times extremely amusing . There are battle scenes , of course , because this romantic triangle between Flagg ( Cagney ) , Quirt ( Dailey ) , and Charmaine ( Calvet ) is being played out against the muddy background of World War I . But , with a few exceptions , the combat scenes , like the romance , are played for laughs . And not in the black-comedy manner of " Dr . Strangelove , " either . ( That sort of ridiculous tragedy might be beyond Ford's comprehension . ) No , the shots of Dailey and Cagney crawling through the mud of No Man's Land with a German prisoner in tow are funny in themselves . Even when the German is killed by shell fire and Dailey is wounded . It's in no way a " deep " film . Nothing so banal as " war is hell . " And it is certainly not one of those anti-war films in which we bleed , sometimes without purpose , but we always win in the end . Flagg's unit marches off to battle yet again , with some of the men limping from wounds and Flagg himself drunk , but there is no triumphant final clash . As pure entertainment , it succeeds fully . The Ephrons , who wrote the screenplay , must have had second sight into the interests and talents of Ford , Cagney , and Dailey because they're all superb . The dialog has to be heard to be enjoyed . Waving his finger as if in an Italian opera , Cagney shouts at the heroic Robert Wagner , " Boy - - I'm going to see that you are sent up for a decoration ! Furthermore - - I PERSONALLY am going to give you - - TEN FRANCS ! " Cagney has never given a more outrageously animated performance , brusque , stomping , marching around , fuming , looking cockeyed . All his mannerisms are here and he plays them to the hilt . Dailey is only a few steps behind him . And Corinne Calvet as the perfidious Charmaine puts what she has into the role but the character , while maddeningly flirtatious , comes across as a little insipid too . How could it be otherwise ? Look at the company she's in . Wagner's love affair with the school-girlish Marissa Pavan is taken seriously , though , and a sappy , sentimental love song is sneaked into the script . Calvet sings a couple of period songs too , but they're mercifully brief . I never cared a fig whether Flagg or Quirt or either of them got to marry Charmaine . And the " what price glory ? " speech , given by a seriously wounded Marine , is misdirected at Flagg . Whatever else Flagg may be interested in , it's not glory . Ford had his demons and was not an easy man to work with , or even necessarily to be acquainted with . In his memoirs , James Cagney recounts some stunt Ford had performed over and over , involving a motorcycle and sidecar plowing into a pile of manure . The gags weren't funny . They were just sadistic and dangerous . And a few years after this release , Ford called Robert Wagner into his office and asked if he was interested in the part of Martin Pawley in the upcoming " The Searchers . " Wagner eagerly said yes , and Ford asked why . Wagner explained - - great script , fascinating character , and so on , until Ford replied , " That's too bad because I've already given the part to Jeffery Hunter . " The disappointed Wagner was half-way out the door when Ford stopped him . " Do you REALLY want that part badly ? " " Yes , " said Wagner . Ford said , " But Jeffrey Hunter is going to play it . " End of interview . Ford's Schadenfreude notwithstanding , it's hard to beat this comedy for sheer momentum . When James Gleason , as a Marine General , sweeps into Cagney's office with a map he wants Cagney to examine , the two of them simply brush all the junk on Cagney's desk onto the floor and spread out the map . What kind of mind thinks up such a gesture ?
442029	819382	47413	7.0	Enjoyable Scott Western .	Considering the budget , and considering other constraints on its quality , this is pretty good - - efficient movie-making at its best . Randolph Scott is a shotgun rider on a stagecoach . The coach is held up and some former enemies capture Scott , hog tie his ass , and leave him to scorch to death in the sun . Tie up Randolph Scott ? Hah ! He rides into town to warn the good folk of the gang's plans , which is to divert the posse into chasing some loose horses so that the gang can loot and pillage the town . I'm not sure exactly how you pillage a village but I'm morally certain that's what they have in mind . The problem is that no one in town believes Scott's warnings . What's worse , they believe him to be in cahoots with the dozen gang members , led by James Millican , with Charles Bronson in support . Narrow-minded hostility surrounds Scott as he tries to spread the alarm and bring back the posse . No one believes him except his girl , Joan Weldon . The deputy , Wayne Morris , is doubtful of the hysteria but , in any case , is in no position to stand alone against them . The town doctor is neutral and wants to see due process exercised . A couple of observations . This is Scott's only Western that I'm aware of in which he provides a noir-like narration . There's nothing wrong with that in principle but in practice it sounds a bit weird . This was released in 1954 , and films noir had dominated American dramatic films for the previous ten years . Fritz Feld was the psychiatrist with a twitch in " Bringing Up Baby . " Here , he plays a treacherous but comic saloon proprietor . His joint is a filthy dump and he himself is unshaven , ragged , and weaselly . He's saddled with a Mexican wife and five children - - none of them boys . When he's excited , his Spanish tirade turns into German . That's understandable because he was born in Berlin . He's a welcome presence . Joan Weldon , Scott's supportive girl friend , doesn't have a Hollywood-beautiful face but she seems to radiate intelligence and a little charm . Anybody who was a singer with the San Francisco Opera has my vote . Also , I blush , but must admit it always found her sexy . The movie also does something interesting , probably unwittingly . It demonstrates the destructive potential of rumor . Now , gossip is a necessary means of social control in human society . ( Lecturer writes " gossip " on blackboard . ) One of the main reasons we don't do bad things is that , if we're found out , our family , friends , and neighbors will not like us so much . But gossip is like water . A certain amount is required for survival but too much of it , out of control , is destructive . We need tap water , not a flood . And we see rumor get subtle autonomy in this movie . The marginalized Scott is holed up in a filthy saloon and every move he makes is interpreted as " bad " and exaggerated by the hostile villagers . If a man tries to shoot Scott , and Scott shoots him in the gun-wielding arm , the story is told that Scott has killed his victim . Everything he does is interpreted by his enemies as deliberately mean . The movie is really a good demonstration of this point . ( Imagine if the villagers had the internet . ) " Riding Shotgun " doesn't have the poetic quality of some of the Boetticher / Scott / Kennedy Westerns of the same period , but I was easily able to enjoy it for what it was .
443474	819382	327056	7.0	What happened to , " My mule don't like you laughin ' at him " ?	Clint Eastwood is a remarkable guy . As he eases into and through his 70s , he's taken more chances than ever , unlike Howard Hawks and so many other artists , who repeat themselves as they age . He's explored new milieus in each of his later movies - - a Western with no heroes , women's boxing , a disappearing ethnic neighborhood , the tragedy of heroism , the social elite of an alien Southern city , an even more alien world of doomed Japanese warriors . And he's done it all with a relaxed grace on happy sets . Not all are successful but each embodies an ambiguity that's stunning . They're adult movies , made by an adult for adults . Kids aren't going to be cheering the good guys because there are no good guys . This is the one about the kind of ethnic neighborhood in which everyone seems to know everyone else . The kind that's rapidly disappearing , in this case Boston Irish . ( The New England accents are just marked enough to fall short of parodies . ) Three men have grown up together , their lives interwoven in various , rather complex ways - - Kevin Bacon , Sean Penn , and Tim Robbins . Bacon has grown into a police officer . Penn is a thug who's spent time in the slams . Robbins is a tormented wretch . The story is hung on the peg of a murder . Penn's young daughter is beaten and shot to death . Bacon probes the case . Robbins , by coincidence , has been involved in a murder that has nothing to do with the death of Penn's daughter but which makes him look guilty nonetheless . Penn , a man of violence , becomes convinced of Robbin's culpability and murders him . When the true perps are revealed , Bacon realizes that Penn will never admit to the mistaken killing of their mutual friend Robbins , but Bacon will need to try pinning him for it , so the two men are now at odds with one another . That's the plot . The real story deals with the exploration of character and of how we are shaped by events that happened long ago , events that we may not even remember with any clarity . The pacing is deliberate , the dialog naturalistic , the mistakes human in their nature , and the location shooting is realistic . ( No tours of Harvard Yard or the Old North Church - - just working-class neighborhoods . ) In addition to the three principals , Eastwood has assembled a fine cast that includes Marcia Gay Hardin , Eli Wallach , and Laura Linney , among others . None of them are glamorized in any way . Closeups reveal Robbin's stubble , Linney's papules , Penn's nevis , and Bacon's blemishes . But none of it comes across as cruel , any more than our looking in the mirror every morning is an act of cruelty . I guess one of the things that's most impressive about Eastwood's articulation of these settings is that none of them was ever his own . As a child of the depression he followed his father around California , mostly working at gas stations . He's reserved and not especially articulate in interviews . His signature ( which I saw on the menu of a Chinese restaurant in Monterey ) is the drawling set of loops of a high school student more interested in athletics than aesthetics . A very rich man , he voted for H . Ross Perot . He was never a cowboy , never an effete homosexual snob , never a Boston Irish kid , but he manages to make these characters come alive for us . Who would have dreamed that there was an embryonic artist maturing under that shabby poncho ?
442725	819382	107808	7.0	Liesurely study of crime and character .	An escaped prison inmate ( Kevin Costner ) kidnaps a young boy ( T . J . Lowther ) , steals numerous cars , encounters people of various dispositions , and aims towards Alaska with his kidnapee . Meanwhile he is pursued across the panhandle , sometimes comically , by a Texas Ranger ( Clint Eastwood ) and a handful of advisers including Laura Dern . The basic story , aside from the inexorability of the law's closing in , has to do with the relationship between the boy , who comes from a rather restrictive household of Jehovah's Witnesses , and the casually cold-blooded Costner , who begins to take on the role of big brother . It ends tragically . The performances are adequate , partly because of professional competence , party because the actors themselves are innately appealing . Clint is only himself , as performer and as director . The pace is slow but the movie doesn't meander . It's an unusual role for Costner . I mean , he's an innocent , fun-loving , idealistic kind of surfer guy , right ? And here he is packing a pistola and abusing people without a sign of chagrin . The little kid , about eight or so , isn't as obnoxious as he might have been , not even when he takes advantage of the opportunity to shoplift and don a Halloween costume of Casper the Friendly Ghost . ( His family doesn't hold with Halloween . ) Perhaps luckily for us , he isn't given that much to say , although , to be sure , sometimes these little buggers can be uncannily effective actors . It's nice that Laura Dern is in it , though her role is pretty much dispensable . Her features are curiously arranged but she's attractive with her long , unruly blond hair and her dark eyebrows , and she's fulsomely sensual too , for a leptosome . The actor who is perfect in image and performance is Wayne Dehart as a good-natured , generous black farmer whose family is tied up and who is almost murdered by Costner after taking him and the boy in for the night and feeding them . ( There were people who would do that in the period of this film , the early 1960s . ) This scene makes it entirely clear that Costner has some buried basura that can turn him into a remorseless killer as easily as popping a zit . The director and the writer ( John Lee Hancock ) kind of blow it in the last scene . Costner has been gut shot by the boy trying to prevent a slaughter , and now they are crumpled together under a " dogleg tree " in the middle of a grassy field , surrounded by police and FBI , who have Costner in their sights and are itching for a chance to take him out . It's an important scene but its impact is vitiated by the length at which it's drawn out . And when Costner sends the boy away and the boy turns around and rushes back into Costner's arms , the scene collapses completely . After all , the kid is so young that he has virtually no awareness of the importance of what's happening . He's just a kid . Here he is , chatting with Costner , who is bleeding like the Fountain of Trevi , and paying no attention to the possibly mortal wound he himself was responsible for . He ignores the ring of armed cops . When a police helicopter lands nearby , the kid brightens and exclaims , " Do you think they'll give me a ride in it ? " This kind of kid shouldn't be sobbing on the dying Costner's shoulder . He should be running towards the police , waving his arms , shouting " Boo ! " , and trying to scare them in his spook costume . And the director and writer shouldn't be pandering to the sentimentalists in us . The movie in some ways resembles Terrence Malick's " Badlands " without being nearly as original . Costner giving the kid advice , for instance , telling him that his penis isn't " puny , " that it's just right for somebody his age , reminds me of the scene in " Badlands " in which Martin Sheen is earnestly recording some banalities on tape - - " Always follow the rules of the majority but never forget about the minority view . " Polonius on mushrooms . But it's those inconsequential moments that give this film the considerable thrust that it has . It's nothing for any of the participants to be ashamed of .
441676	819382	498380	7.0	Do what is right , because it is right .	This is a pretty courageous movie . Eastwood has produced and directed the story of one of the most bitter conflicts of World War II - - which we get to see from the Japanese point of view . The Americans ( OUR side ) are the faceless enemies ! And it's not done by the numbers either . The doomed Japanese are not handled with careless and facile sentimentality . Some are loyal and brave , but humane - - notably Ken Watanabe's officer . Others are stern with their own troops and savage towards the US troops . They all demonstrate emotions of one sort or another , recognizably human . It's a more concentrated version of the Japanese soldiers we saw in films like Cornell Wild's " Beach Red " and David Lean's " The Bridge on the River Kwai . " If Eastwood's " Flags of Our Fathers " was heads , this is the tails side of the same coin . The same - - yet , not the same . " Flags of Our Fathers " is the better film for a number of reasons . One is that the earlier film had focus that this one lacks . Three Marines and a Navy corpsman touring the states on a trumped-up victory trip to raise money . We got to know the four guys and the tragic aftermath of their victory . The structure of " Letters From Iwo Jima " is more diffuse . With the exception of Watanabe , it's hard to tell one Japanese soldier from another , partly because the film is shot almost entirely in darkness , the color is desaturated to the point at which it is almost black and white , and because uniforms , as always , make it difficult to tell who's who . ( " Band of Brothers " had a similar problem . ) The " letters " in the title aren't often heard from in the film . Nothing easy . No , " I love you , darling , and I miss the cherry blossoms in the Spring . " Rather , an officer reads a letter found on a dying Marine . It's from his mother , who advises him to " do what is right , because it's right . " Later , before ordering his men on a suicidal attack , he preps them with the same words . Presumably the writer meant the parallel to be ironic , but she hit on a larger question . Exactly what does " right " mean ? Even if you are able to step outside the box and examine your situation objectively , what ethic is available as a guide ? In the case of Iwo Jima , " right " meant dying with honor to the Japanese . Pragmatically , it now seems foolish . The Japanese had built fifteen miles of tunnels under the little island , some of the tunnel walls were shellacked . It was like living in a hotel with no room service . Yet the American fleet consisted of 150 ships which , if they'd been in a line-astern formation , would have stretched for seventy miles . Theoretically , the battle was over the moment the fleet appeared . The hopeless resistance led to the spilling of blood by about all of the Japanese and an appalling number of Marines . Would we have done things differently ? Probably . We surrendered in a nice pragmatic way on Wake Island . Ditto the British in Singapore . Ditto the American and Fillipino troops on Bataan , although there were undoubtedly those among them for whom " surrender is not an option " was a popular slogan . It's a sad movie and truly anti war . The final scene has Watanabe's brief case being dug up year later and its contents dumped unceremoniously out onto the dusty soil . The contents are nothing more than personal letters . Lots of letters . What seems like hundreds and hundreds of letters , leaving us with the impression that Watanabe , like the other casualties on both sides , would have had a lot more to say had he lived .
441682	819382	40076	7.0	Fast Flynn Swashbuckler .	This was Flynn's last big one . He was only 38 at the time but had begun drinking in the afternoon , causing problems on the set , what with multiple retakes and a major binge that lasted several weeks . It's not " The Sea Hawk " or " Robin Hood . " Still , the film was artfully edited and clearly a lot of money was spent on it . The Technicolor photography is outstanding and nobody ever looked quite so natural in a gaudy period outfit as Flynn . It holds one's interest . The story has Flynn as Don Juan , lover and swordsman , returning to Spain at the beginning of the 1600s . It's really a pastiche , kind of like " The Sea Hawk " with elements introduced from various other films of the genre . There's the well-intentioned Queen , the beautiful Viveca Lindfors of the plump lips and strong features , surrounded by weaklings and traitors who want to go to war - - except for Don Juan , of course . ( Cf . , " The Sea Hawk . " ) There's the comic sidekick , Alan Hale . ( Cf . , all of Flynn's Warners pictures . ) The good guys disguised as hooded monks . ( " Robin Hood " , " The Mark of Zorro . " ) The hero and villain , face to face and belly to belly , straining at their crossed swords , and the villain sneakily withdrawing a dagger from his belt ( " Robin Hood " ) . The hero captured and thrown into prison to await execution , only to make a spectacular escape . ( " Robin Hood " , " The Mark of Zorro . " ) Shadows fighting on the castle wall . ( " Robin Hood , " " The Prisoner of Zenda " . ) And so on . Some shot are edited in that are taken directly from " Robin Hood " and " Elizabeth and Essex . " Robert Douglas is Duke de Lorca , the heavy . He makes a slimier heavy than Basil Rathbone did . Douglas is okay but Rathbone was a nonpareil with his tall figure , abrupt movements , and darting glances . Perc Westmore was responsible for the make-up . He should be proud of himself for the task with which Flynn must have presented him . But he should be ashamed of himself for what he did to the villains . You know how you can tell the principal villains from everyone else ? They all have dark eye shadow , so they look like the ghouls or zombies in a Grade C horror flick . Douglas has this sinister curl down the middle of his forehead that looks painted on . The director , Vincent Sherman , doesn't seem to have compelled any of the performers to act with any subtlety . It's not that kind of movie . But everyone is professionally competent . Alan Hale - - well , it's as if he were your fond uncle . Viveca Lindfors probably puts the most effort into her work . When Flynn enters her life she becomes positively , and literally , breathless . And watch the fleeting expressions that cross her features when Flynn confesses his love for her - - the briefest of half-hopeful smiles followed by a scowl of indignation . The amours of Don Juan occasion some amusing moments . One of the many young ladies who come to watch him instruct the members of the fencing academy leaves her fan behind . When Flynn calls this to her attention , she replies , " You WILL return it , won't you ? It's the house on the Plaza Madrid . The last house on the right . " " Oh , on the RIGHT , " says a resigned Flynn , who has heard this hundreds of times before . The budgets on Flynn's pictures dropped dramatically after " The Adventures of Don Juan . " He chain smoked , used drugs , boozed it up daily , and never complained . He died at the age of 50 , having lived as he pleased .
443314	819382	36104	7.0	Exciting Small-Budget Murder Mystery .	Produced by Val Lewton's horror unit at RKO and directed by Jaques Tourneur , this was done on a minuscule budget . That has to be emphasized , otherwise somebody's going to start comparing it to " The Exorcist " or " Titanic " or " Pearl Harbor " and call it a cheap piece of junk . It's not , really . From a Cornell Woolrich novel , written by Ardel Wray and polished by Lewton , this is a well-done , unpretentious , spooky movie that was truly innovative . The title - - " The Leopard Man " - - was forced on them by RKO . Credit where credit is due . They made a scenic mountain out of an exhausted molehill . ( At other times , they had to invent stories to fit such tricky titles as " I Walked With a Zombie " and " The Seventh Victim " . Who were going to be the first six ? ) The whole thing was shot on hastily thrown-together sets or on sets left over from earlier productions . The shooting was usually a month or less . Under these conditions , movies often turn out to be ludicrously bad . But Lewton not only had good taste , he managed to infuse it successfully into this unpromising material . His preparation and research were meticulous . With any other crew this would have been a straightforward horror / murder mystery . Lewton and Tourneur give it much more heft . A leopard , harmless unless frightened , escapes from a nightclub in a small New Mexican town . Late that night , the cat attacks and rips apart a teenage Mexican girl after she pounds against the door of her house . Inside , her mother and brother tease her for being frightened of the dark until they finally realize something horrible is happening . They can't slide back the lock on the door although they bang it and shake it . The cries outside case and the family look down to see a blackish oily stream of blood running in under the door . The blood meets a joint in the wooden floor and equal threads run almost esthetically into the crease and ooze away in opposite directions . It's a horrifying scene . There are other shockers , which I won't go into . Lewton called them " buses " , for reasons stemming from his first assignment , " The Cat People . " The structure is unusual . There are no flashbacks or any directorial fireworks but the story switches casually from one character to another . Not in a predictable way , but not in any way that is at all difficult to follow . An example . After the credits , the camera pans through the open door of a nightclub dressing room where we see Margo in black dancing with her castanets . We are introduced to one of the victims right at the start . But the camera continues its smooth pan to the open door of the next dressing room , where a performer dressed in a white robe pounds on the wall to shut Margo up . In the first ten second we get a general idea of the setting ( nightclub , Southwest , Mexican influence ) , two of the main characters ( one in black and one in white ) , and the relationship between them ( hostile ) , all before a word is spoken . That's economic story telling . But the dialog and technique are now and then relaxed enough for a few offhand and apparently irrelevant observations . The night club has a fountain with a stream of water spurting straight up a few feet above . Balanced on the top of that stream is a small white ball , like a ping pong ball , held in place by forces familiar to physicists but mystical to the rest of us . A tweedy pipe-smoking museum curator is chatting casually with someone , points to the ball bouncing around slightly , and remarks that we have no more understanding or control of the forces that govern us than that ball does . It's an apt visual metaphor . Lewton was a gloomy Russian immigrant .
443244	819382	356487	7.0	A whistle-blower movie , and a good one .	There have been myriad films about whistle blowers since the success of " Serpico " - - and before ( eg . , " On the Waterfront " ) . Some , like those mentioned , are quite well done . Others are Hollywoodized to the point of staged but fake reality and one hundred percent predictability . I won't mention any . Well , I will - - " The Insider " - - done strictly by the buck , I mean the book . Here's a film from Argentina about a pilot ( Enrique Pineyro ) , a guy nobody in the major film audience ever heard of , with a handsomeness quotient the equal of a soft-boiled egg , who quietly complains to his friends , his colleagues , and his bosses about the slack way regulations are enforced by his airline company , LAPA . Whatsmore , the real Enrique Pineyro is played by the real Enrique Pineyro . His reports about equipment failure and corner cutting do nothing but get him into trouble . There is a government investigation ongoing , but the investigation isn't getting any help from LAPA executives , who want to expand the company , or from LAPA's pilots who are afraid of losing their jobs and guarded about the possibility of failure being attributed to " pilot error , " something which no professional pilot wants to admit , or even talk about . Somebody fills the investigator's car with gum balls . And when that doesn't discourage him , a few bullets are sent his way through the window of his home . Pineyro wants nothing more than to fly - - and for him and his co-workers to be able to do it in safety . He writes a letter about his working conditions and sends it to - - get this - - the New York Times , who publish it in a front-page article . This leads to the resignation of the chief executives and their replacement by a bunch of clones who continue the same corrupt practices . Pilots are supposed to take regular vacations because a tired pilot is a threat to safety , but LAPA isn't giving them the time off that the law requires . In one case , the company owes a pilot SIX YEARS worth of vacations . In extremis , Pineyro resigns from LAPA and takes all the information he has to the government investigator , who then accesses all the company's files and reports , but not before a fatal accident occurs , due to lack of oversight . We don't get to see the accident . We don't get to see ANY accidents . Hardly anyone shouts at anyone else . Pineyro , aside from the ordinariness of his appearance , is perfectly ordinary . I swear that non-Hollywood productions have this eerie capacity for picking non-magnetic people for lead roles who have a talent for demonstrating just how good they are at playing their roles . Has anyone taken a close look at Daniel Auteuil's face lately ? Or Jean Gabin's ? It's not a zapped-up whistle-blower movie . The score is so sparse as to be hardly noticeable . ( Excellent use is made of a piano piece I once picked up on my car radio . I figured it was by Mozart and I recognized the form as variations on a theme , but I couldn't make out the theme because it was so disguised . I couldn't wait for its restatement at the end , imagining it would be elegant and sophisticated . It turned out to be " Twinkle , Twinkle , Little Star . " ) There are quite a few shots of the pilot and copilot at the controls of the big Boeing they fly , and they're great , with the comfortably lighted control panel in the foreground and the magnificent city lights beyond the windshield . There is no mock up of the flight deck . All the shots are done during flight . As far as I could tell , none of the other scenes were shot in a studio either . You really don't want to watch this if you have anything against subtitles , even though the flight language is English - - " gear up , " " seat belts on , " and so forth . And you don't want to watch it if you're easily bored if nobody thrusts his hand down a victim's throat and yanks out his bleeding pyloric sphincter . If you want heroism , high drama , car chases , and fast editing , this isn't your cup of yerba mate . But if you want a glimpse into how the real world of the bureaucracy works , you might learn from this one .
443482	819382	36910	8.0	Propaganda - - good propaganda .	The poetry is sublime . A little touch of Harry in the night Once more , dear friends , once more unto the breach . The history sucks . Hitler used the same reasoning . Oh , please , don't make us invade your city and rape your women and smash your babies ' brains out against the wall . Please - - give up before you make us do this . Show us that you have destroyed your WMDs . Oops . How does Olivier , the director and principal , handle the production ? Pretty well . The movie's the thing , you know , and he does an extremely good job of managing it . Clearly he's watched a couple of Errol Flynn movies . He has lightly clad men armed only with knives dropping from the branches onto heavily armored French knights . ( Cf . , Robin Hood . ) He has a shot of a line of French knights and gaily flapping flags advancing towards the English at Agincourt , first at a walk , then a trot , then a gallop . ( Cf . , The Charge of the Light Brigade . ) But he has some unexpectedly original shots too - - a startling brief glimpse of a horse's bared teeth in the midst of battle . Harry was a marvelous young kid . Here he's a king and thrusts Falstaff aside . ( If you want to see Falstaff in excelsis you must see The Merry Wives of Windsor . ) Harry's claim to the throne of France is bull . In the play it takes up a lot of time , ratiocination by bishops who are trying to avoid taxes . Some gobblydegook about the Salic law entitling Henry to the throne of France , which had heretofore been either ignored or forgotten . It's all glossed over , here . The French are turned into outright villains - - foppish , insulting , comic ( a scene of a fully armored French knight being lowered jerkily onto his horse by means of a winch ) . Oh , they're sadists too . They raid Henry's supply camps and butcher the young boys they find there . But there's no denying the impact of the play . You'll get caught up in it . And , if you don't know what a Bohemian Henry V was , or how close he was to Sir John Falstaff , and if the movie " four score and five " English dead after Agincourt , an undercount if there ever was one , then what difference does it make ? Lawrence Olivier's performance can't go unmentioned though . It's just plain superb . He was a truly great actor , and there may never have been a Henry V ( or a Hamlet ) that was his equal . Here's the story . On a pretext , Henry V invades France and marries some high-class babe . England DID wind up ruling parts of northern France , as I remember , but not for long after Henry's departure .
442661	819382	431197	8.0	Very Well-Done International Police Thriller .	There is an extremely violent attack within the protected area of Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , and many men , women , and children are killed , including some Americans . America has no jurisdiction but back-negotiations lead to a team of American agents led by the FBI's Jamie Foxx acquiring a five-day pass in Riyadh to help the Saudi police . There follows a kind of introduction to Islamic customs , which many Americans are badly in need of . When you shake hands with a Saudi nobleman , you don't let go of his hand until he does . ( Videoclips of President Bush holding hands with a Saudi royal were played repeatedly on television , often accompanied by sarcastic comments , but this was at least one occasion on which Bush had been properly briefed and the press not . ) These Arabs object to dirty words like bull , and the colonel shouts at an American that his mother should have washed out his mouth . An infidel is not allowed to touch a Moslem's body , and so forth . Of course Islam , like all world religions , has multitudinous " little traditions " in which different rules apply , but this is the official Saudi version . Well , let us not get into cultural anthropology . The four members of the team ( including Jennifer Garner , Jason Bateman , and the ever-reliable Chris Cooper ) are met by the Saudi Police Colonel ( Ashrof Barhom ) whose strictly defined job is to herd them around the site of the blast and keep them from getting themselves hurt . The colonel offers his help reluctantly and keeps within the rules but gradually he and the team members warm to one another and eliminate the criminals behind the blast , but only at terrible cost . This is a mature movie and in many ways exceedingly well done . It isn't AT ALL like " Not Without My Children . " The Moslems are different from us , but not all of them are enemies , unless you sloppily define everyone who is different from us as an enemy . And the Americans are not morally pure or arrogant . As Foxx tells the colonel , " America isn't perfect . I'm the first to admit it . But this is something we are very very good at . " And the team IS good at it , better than the Saudi police , which is believable enough . I mean , these Americans are the cream of the crop , the best we have to offer . I don't know what would happen if you threw Lieutenant Columbo into Riyadh but these four people know what they're doing . I enjoyed the story because it seems , in some sense a little hard to define , realistic . The script gives the performers believable little exchanges and the actors live up to the demands . The photography is fine as well . And the plot is a real thriller . It could have gone completely awry , with heroes killing villains by the gross , but it sticks to its guns and refuses to pander to the adolescent in us . When the high muck-a-mucks are finally tracked down and most of them killed , they aren't a garden-variety gang of ugly , sneering thugs . They are a family with a couple of attached violence-prone friends . The leader is a man so old he can't rise out of bed , yet he can slowly slide an automatic weapon out from under his mattress . He dies with his grandchild sobbing on his riddled chest . Another family member is a gawky adolescent who shoots the colonel in the back and is in turn disarticulated by the team's bullets . The team survives all sorts of tribulations but not with superhuman heroics , just a certain amount of skill and a lot of luck , and they lose a good friend in the bargain . It ends realistically , not hopefully . In the apartment of the head honcho , with gory bodies strewn about the floor , the women and children squeeze themselves into corners and weep as the smoke clears . Jennifer Garner offers a lollipop to the tiny girl to quiet her down . She accepts the candy when her mother allows her to , and in return she meekly hands a gift to Garner . The little girl's hand opens and on its palm rests a large marble - - the stuff that has been encased in the explosive charge . The movie isn't perfect . It was directed by the actor Peter Berg and it is to him that we owe " the wobbling camera " problem . The camera wobbles . It wobbles almost constantly , though not as bad as in , say , " The Bourne Ultimatum . " Sometimes the camera hides behind an object that obscures half our view , but it still wobbles . It doesn't HAVE to wobble to be exciting . I mean , take a look at the equally tense and violent shoot-out at the end of " Heat . " No wobbles . I blame this insane and irritating fad on two things : ( 1 ) A generation of kids who grew up on video games in which everything is motion under a time constraint , and ( 2 ) the MBAs who green light projects like this and firmly believe that the camera must be constantly moving and the editing lightning fast or those kids who grew up on video games will be bored . The technique , though , doesn't match the content here . A childish trick applied to adult material . Or maybe I'm turning into an old curmudgeon . It happens . Why , just yesterday my spectacles fell off into my guacamole .
442118	819382	37017	8.0	Thoughtful and Exciting Drama From Hitchcock .	This doesn't get much attention and I'm not sure why , because it certainly deserves more . The story of a diverse handful of survivors adrift in the Atlantic after their ship is torpedoed , it represents one of the technical and narrative challenges that Hitchcock at the time was beginning to impose on himself . There's only one set - - the lifeboat - - and how do you give the ten or so people aboard enough to do and say to keep the audience watching ? You can't have them almost mowed down by an airplane in the middle of a corn field . Hitchcock and his writers handled the problem deftly . There isn't a dull moment in the film . They fight storms , cut off legs , play cards , get drunk , fall in love , and kill each other . John Steinbeck wrote the treatment and the screenplay was polished off by Jo Swerling . It immediately ran into trouble with the Office of War Information and the Breen Office . The handful of British and American survivors pick up the captain of the U-boat , now sunk , that torpedoed their ship - - good old Willie . Willie proves to be more focused and more able than anyone else in the boat . He's not only a master seaman and navigator but a surgeon as well . He turns out to be cheerful , practical , cherubic , avuncular , perceptive , melodious , charismatic , and murderous . He rows the boat in the general direction of the U-boat's mother ship while he sings German folk songs and the others tootle along , accompanying him on a flute . " How'm I doing , Willie ? " , asks the millionaire Henry Hull . The hypermasculine , possibly communist , John Hodiak mocks Hull in a queer voice , " How'm I doin ' , Willie ? " , and then cackles . And why not ? After all , everybody in the boat is accompanying Willie . The problem , as the censors saw it , was that Willie was superior to anyone else in the boat and Willie was a Nazi . The fact that Willie was cheating by swigging from a concealed bottle of water , taking vitamin pills , and peeking at a hidden compass was trumped by the obvious fact that he was the only person who knew exactly what he was doing . The Germans could have shown the film throughout Europe as pro-Nazi propaganda . Steinbeck caught most of the heat for this , as he had for an earlier screenplay , " The Moon is Down , " that humanized a German soldier . Was Steinbeck a crypto-fascist ? It's ironic that the question should have been raised because before the war , Steinbeck , the author of such modestly leftist works as " To a God Unknown " and " The Grapes of Wrath " , was accused of being a Commie . There are a couple of shots that no other director would have employed because no other director would have thought of them , and they're not necessarily dramatic or suspenseful . It's a languorous afternoon on the becalmed sea . Hodiak , his torso mottled with tattoos is reading an old newspaper . We see the newspaper from his point of view . Then a mischievous finger pokes slowly through the page and pulls the paper away , to be replaced by Tallulah Bankhead's seductively smiling face dropping gently backwards onto Hodiak's lap . While they swap back stories , she produces her lipstick and adds another fake tattoo to his chest - - the initials C . P . They're Bankhead's initials , of course , " Connie Porter " , but they also hint at " Communist Party . " With only a few minor exceptions , the acting is superb . I never found myself under Talullah Bankhead's Magic Spell but if I had to choose an actress to play a spoiled , snobbish , rich bitch it might be her . She seems to belong in that mink coat and she practically owns that smoke-cured voice . In many ways , this is her story . She's progressively stripped of every material possession she uses to define herself , and it's her character that shows the most development . Canada Lee , as the black guy , is a fine actor and has the right face for the part but he's saddled with a stereotypical role . There isn't space to get into all the characters but it's clear that Hitchcock opted for genuine faces instead of glamor pusses in this story . John Hodiak looks like an ordinary stoker , not like Cary Grant . And I mean - - take a look at Hume Cronyn . A face made for radio . You really shouldn't miss this one . It's a lesson in movie-making .
442368	819382	120815	8.0	The Fate of Rebels	Seeing it again , nine years after its release , you can't help being struck by how familiar things are : the pale blue cast of the photography , the distinctive special effects , the squib charges exploding not with blood but with dust when a man is hit , the clank of bullet against armor , the shaky camera , the enemy seen as dark phantoms scurrying through the murk of the battlefield , the tiny fountain of cork chips as a bullet slams into the dirt , the attention to period detail , the necessity of reloading at particularly awkward moments . All of this is familiar now because it's been so often aped , often in strong films like " Band of Brothers " and " Blackhawk Down " . I doubt that anyone could make an " ordinary " war film anymore . Slow , cheap ones like Sam Fuller's or even innovative grunt's-view stories like " Platoon . " If you're going to make a war movie now , Spielberg's " Saving Private Ryan " is the bogie you have to match . It is the fate of rebels to found orthodoxies . And what an innovation this movie was . Oliver Stone must be applauded for tackling a subject like the Vietnam war that was so controversial that the conflict was avoided for more than ten years , because of the still smoldering emotions the war had generated . If Vietnam had been a human being it would have had to stalk around dressed in rags , tinkling a little bell , and crying " Unclean , unclean . " " Saving Private Ryan " ' s subject is less controversial . First , the enemy really WAS our enemy . ( Germany declared war on the USA first , not the other way around . ) Second , well - - we won , didn't we ? But it is probably more original in its details . And candid too . A German and an American soldier are locked in bitter mano a mano conflict , and the German wins ! And not by cheating either ! He is the bigger man and finally overpowers the American and inch by inch sinks the American's own bayonet into his chest . He does not gloat or smile . It's no tennis game to the German , but a deadly necessity , just as it is for the American soldier . " Relax , " the German pants in a low voice , " it's very simple , " as the tip of the knife slowly penetrates the American's chest . The scene is phenomenally stark . The most complex character is Upham's . The rest of the Americans play their assigned roles , performing impossible feats of bravery . This is precisely what the Germans are doing too . But Upham fails at a crucial point and costs the lives of his allies . The viewer can sit back and make Olympian judgments about Upham's character , but consider that for every hour Upham spent in combat he was as valiant as everyone else for fifty-five minutes . He translated , was almost run over by a tank , ran across open spaces under fire , and carried ammunition . But those fifty-five minutes don't count on his side , only the five during which he was frozen in tonic immobility , a fundamental mammalian trait which - - not having been in Upham's place ourselves - - we can condemn him for . Maybe nobody can define an " anti-war movie . " They ALL claim to be anti-war movies . How could you possibly market a PRO-war movie unless we were formally at war with another nation ? To many people , an anti-war movie is a simple excuse to give us more action and more blood . Put Steven Segal in combat boots . Others are anti-war because they give us a glimpse of the enemy's humanity somewhere along the line . But in all the anti-war movies we always seem to win , as indeed we do in " Saving Private Ryan " . ( The cavalry comes galloping to the rescue . ) All war movies , even those depicting a " defeat " like Pearl Harbor , seem to endorse the same bumper-sticker slogan : " No matter how sneaky or noble they may be , they can't whip us . " I guess it takes an enormous amount of courage - - in Hollywood - - to ask an audience to pay money to see a movie in which we lose a war or a battle or a fist fight with an enemy . It's what I admire about a movie as flawed as " A Bridge Too Far . " And it's what makes me feel more involved in the tragedy shown in " Saving Private Ryan . " That hand-to-hand fight that the American loses contravenes established war narratives . What ? We LOSE ? It's as shocking as Hitchcock's killing of Janet Leigh half-way through " Psycho . " Don't miss " Saving Private Ryan , " a milestone at the time .
442748	819382	83909	8.0	An Unexpected Surprise	Larry Schiller , who is credited with directing this movie , comes off in Mailer's book as a no-nonsense , grasping , egomaniacal self promoter - - a Horace Babbitt for our times . So it comes as a big surprise to find that this movie is professionally done and even tasteful . Schiller was one of the first , well , journalists ( I guess ) , on the scene and sewed up a lot of exclusive contracts with informants . He sold the rights to Mailer . As Schiller's character puts it in this movie , " I'm all suited up and ready to play . " And even in enterprises subsequent to Gilmore's story , Schiller is generally described as such a crumb that it's surprising to find this movie has no great directorial displays - - no razzle dazzle pyrotechnics , just clean , functional direction and editing . Of course , Mailer's book was too long to be condensed into even a miniseries in all its complexity , so certain incidents needed to be deleted or compressed . The snitch planted in Gary's cell , for instance . Or the fact that the murders were preceded not by one break up with Nicole Baker but two . Or the fact that there was no one " going away party " for Gary before his execution , but two , the first one having been premature ( and anticlimactic ) . Mailer's book by the way is probably his last very good work , filled with a casual irony that is sometimes amusing . After the first killing , Gary takes the teen aged April to a motel room where , Mailer observes , a paper ribbon has been placed across the closed and antiseptic toilet to prove that nobody has lifted the toilet seat since the paper was placed there . There's no humor in the movie . It's a straightforward , plain-vanilla telling of Gilmore's brief period between his release from prison and his death by firing squad . Tommy Lee Jones is very good as Gary Gilmore . His energy is barely contained . He paces back and forth at moments of tension and gestures in unfamiliar , almost bizarre ways as he tries , for instance , to flag down cars on a highway . He twists his lines in equally idiosyncratic ways , the way Lee Marvin often did , so that one never knows exactly what's coming next . The only other performer of real importance is Rosanne Arquette as Gilmore's girl friend , Nicole . She looks - - ummm - - very nice . Her acting is okay as well , although she doesn't come across nearly as seedy as Jones does . She sounds as if she'd spent time in college , whereas Jones ( who was in Harvard ) sounds like he's spent half his life in prison . She is , however , so succulent that one hardly notices her performance . The movie has no superscore . The music is country and western , and unusually apt . It adds to the shabby atmosphere established . Nobody seems to be really having a good time . And I never suspected Salt Lake City had such a debauched underworld - - people guzzling beer as they drive , smoking , shacking up impulsively , strung out on dope and New Age insanity . Yet they are for the most part respectable and law abiding , even the tattooed bikers and other lowlifes that Gary cultivates as friends . There are only two murders and we don't see the victims ' heads explode . In fact there is hardly any blood . ( That's what I meant when I said the movie was relatively tasteful . ) What motivated Gilmore ? I mean , two senseless killings for a few dollars to pay off a pickup truck . Who knows ? Not even Gilmore knows . Ditto for Nicole Baker . She and Gary agreed to commit joint suicide while he was in prison . The first attempt failed and they tried a second time . ( One of the attempts is again omitted as anticlimactic , which is okay . ) She smuggled the depressants into the prison by putting them in a balloon in her vagina . This may or may not sound realistic , but it is . I was surprised to find couples in the visiting room at California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo engaged in almost everything short of what might be a definition of " sexual relations " broader than that of President Clinton . Neat . The inmates were doing a lot better than I had at their age . This is an above average miniseries , well worth watching . Not full of pungent insights into human nature or anything - - just a gripping story of a doomed and careless man . Get the unrated version .
441743	819382	37366	8.0	Flying High Now	This is not at all a bad movie . Earlier comments have observed that the first half of the film is mushy and corny , but let us be kind to the demand characteristics of the time . The USA was a lot cornier then than it is now . And even during that first half , the film is more than watchable . Van Johnson does his all-American boy bit ( has he ever done otherwise ) and it emerges as an appealing portrait of an ordinary guy , rather than the slavering war monger Ted Lawson could have been turned into . He's so naive he doesn't even hate the Japanese . He once had a friend who had a Japanese gardener who seemed like " a nice enough fellow . " His prevailing desire ? Not " Kill More Japs , " but , " Gee , I wish this war was over . " Phyllis Thaxter does an adequate job of hiding her anxiety beneath her love for her " fella . " The film is long and in many ways more detailed than the book and , hold on , in some ways an improvement . Lawson's book is short and to the point and dwells on his horrible wound in a way that a wartime movie could not . Mitchum's role is expanded and made complex by his not-quite-hidden attraction to Lawson's wife , Ellen . True , sometimes the mushiness goes over the top . The jitterbugging is unecessary and I don't suppose we really need the last dance to " Auld Lang Syne , " and yet when one of the wives whispers to her husband ( two characters we hardly know ) , " I love you , " over and over , the sense it evokes isn't one of bathos but of the anguish of impending loss and the helplessness people feel in the face of it . There are small details that seem true . Lawson is called up for his last flight while still hung over and he spills aspirin all over the bathroom floor while getting his gear together . The launch scenes aboard the Hornet are bullet biters . Everything seems barely organized chaos . Wind shrieks , clothing flaps , rain and spray splatter everyone , people shout to make themselves heard over the shattering noise and vibrations of airplane engines , last minute favors are asked and granted , and one never knows if the left engine will quit or whether the dorsal turret will work . And there has rarely been a more vivid conveyance of the sense of flight at low level , first over the sea , then over geometrical patterns of agriculture . Everything seems to be moving - - and moving too fast , almost , for comprehension . And always the roar and rush of engine and wind . ( I don't know why the list of locations for this film didn't include the coast of California , where the encounter between bombers and land was shot . ) The bombing itself , involving models , is rudimentary by today's standards . The crash of the B-25 into the massive surf during a rainstorm off the Chinese coast is over in a minute and we see Lawson staggering on the beach , staring at the double tail of the ruined airplane emerging from the ocean , saying mournfully , " I lost my ship . I lost my ship . " ( Little of this is in the book . ) From here on , the film gets a bit confusing . The Chinese are portrayed as sympathetic and as helpful as their conditions allow . The amputation of Lawson's leg is handled with surprising realistic detail . The scene makes it clear that he can feel the first bite of the surgeon's scalpel despite his spinal . " Boy , when you said you were gonna cut high you weren't kidding . " It doesn't get better , either . There's a silly scene of Lawson hallucinating a phone call to Ellen while he is stranded in timber country and a tree is sawed down and felled outside his window , but the incongruity comes as a relief since it removes us from the source of Lawson's pain . Lawson's return to safety and his reluctance to see his wife again because of his perceived deformity is as brief as convention allows . Thank God , nobody refers to him as " half a man . " All together , a fine film . An unforgettable one , even .
442178	819382	45161	8.0	So much better than it would be if remade today .	I think I've only seen this twice - - once in its release , when I was a kid , and again on TV , about ten years ago , so my memory of the details are a bit fuzzy . The plot is rudimentary by our standards . A sniper ( Arthur Franz ) is stalking San Francisco . The police ( Adolf Menjou ) want to either shoot him or catch him and send him to the gas chamber . The humanist psychiatrist ( Richard Kiley ) argues that anyone who snipes women who are strangers to him must be mentally ill and the object of his capture should be incarceration and treatment rather than death . As I said , it's pretty dated , isn't it ? Compare it to " Dirty Harry , " in which the sniper is nothing more than an evildoer who shoots San Franciscans " because he likes it . " The Dirty Harry sniper is protected by an ineffectual judicial system . We root for Harry who simply wants to " shoot the b . " How times have changed . About the time this movie was released , my underaged friends and I used to peek through the windows of a lesbian bar in Greenwich Village . Every third or fourth time we were lined up with our noses against the glass , a police officer would sneak up behind us and go down the row hitting us on top of the head with his baton - - BOP , BOP , BOP . . . Always the same cop ! And without even reading us our rights ! That's the attitude of the police in this movie . The cops are practically paleolithic . Nobody's hampered by this business about fair treatment . Kill ' em all and let God sort ' em out ! ( Please , that's called " sarcasm " . ) Menjou is outraged and snappish , Kiley the voice of sweet reason . And Franz , the sniper ? Well , it had something to do with his mother . We don't find this out until about half way through the movie when his landlady tells him to be careful with his stove , didn't his mother ever teach him that ? Franz stops in mid-stair and grimly announces , " My mother never taught me anything . " The movie is dated in two other ways . I can't tell you how shocking the murder scenes were in 1952 . The critics were appalled and some theaters edited out the shootings . But the two or three that are shown on the screen are in long shot and by current standards ludicrously tame . Here's the other way in which its dated - - the resolution . The police finally identify the sniper , find out which barren room Franz lives in , determine that he's at home , and surround the place with an army of cop cars and tommy-gun agents of the law , every sight trained on the windows of Franz's digs . Franz spots them , assembles and loads his rifle , and waits for them . Menjou , who has by this time begun to see what Kiley has been driving at , calls through a bullhorn for Franz to come out with his hands up . Silence . The cops want to turn the apartment into lace but Menjou demurs . Let's try to talk to him first . A party of them , bristling with guns , sneaks up the stairs and slowly swings open the door to Franz's room expecting him to start shooting . Instead they find Franz sitting in front of the windows , rifle across his lap , catatonic , tears on his face . Imagine a similar contemporary movie ending with such a dying fall . Would the cops find Franz sitting quietly alone ? That's meant to be a rhetorical question . I think we all know what would happen in a modern movie when the police surrounded Franz's apartment . Just follow the numbers . Every window for miles around would be shattered by bullets . The walls would be splattered with blood and brains . The sniper would drag a 40 millimeter cannon out of his closet . San Francisco would be levelled . The actual quiet resolution would generate in modern audiences a vague sense of disappointment . " Talky , " the kids would complain between gulps of high-energy soft drinks . " Too slow . " Stanley Kramer , never an articulate man in his own right , turned extraordinarily preachy in his later movies , but this is Kramer during his early period , when he didn't LOOM over his productions quite so much . Splendid use is made of unfamiliar and very ordinary San Francisco locations , by the way . The movie was shot at a time when the city still had a sizable working-class population , now largely disappeared . Worth seeing , definitely .
442267	819382	37420	8.0	What's that clicking in your throat ?	This is about as corny as they come . Everybody's so - - NICE . Danny Kaye is a shy elevator operator . Dinah Shore is a nurse who loves him . Constance Dowling is the girl Danny Kaye thinks he loves , but when she meets Danny's roommate , Dana Andrews , they fall for one another . ( During a scene involving a horse-drawn milk wagon - - those were the days . ) They all wind up in the Army and are sent to the Pacific . Danny accidentally becomes a hero . He winds up with Dinah , and Constance winds up with Dana . Everybody lives happily ever after . The whole thing was shot in an MGM studio and looks entirely phony . I love it . I used to watch it repeatedly with my kid when he was about ten . We had practically all the dialog memorized . The hypochondriacal Kaye is taking a passenger in his elevator , down from a doctor's office to the lobby . The guy tells Kaye he's feeling just fine now and clears his throat a bit . " What's that clicking in your throat ? " asks Kaye , backing away . By the time they reach the lobby the poor guy staggers out , his face pale , his hands clutched to his chest . Well , no need to go on about this . It's a salubrious mixture of romance and comedy , with Kaye having to imitate a Scotsman and so forth , acquiring the reputation of a real lady's man and the nickname " The Purple Flash . " His ridiculous song is in my opinion the funniest he's done on screen . We glean from the gibberish that he's been drafted and is trying to get out of it by offering all kinds of excuses to the draft board . In one of them - - I guess I can mention this , since it seemed to have slipped by the censors - - he's offering medical reasons why he should be exempt . Weeping piteously , still sputtering nonsense , he makes a pumping motion with his fist then points to his head and twirls his finger . At the end he falls off the stage into the band . Just two more things , I swear , then I'll quit . Dinah Shore gets to sing and record a really lovely gelatinous 1940s ballad . What a marvelous voice she had , so on pitch , feminine , and full of feeling . The name of the song is " Now I Know . " The lyricist should be drummed out of his professional society . Here - - as in the other one or two song - - the lyrics are about as bad as they come . At any rate , Kaye takes the record and a forbidden record player on board the troopship , where he is harassed by most of the other soldiers , big tough specimens too . During one confrontation with them , the record starts playing and Kaye has to lip-synch the words while the others stare at him goggle-eyed . Finally , the stylus gets caught in a groove and Dinah Shore's voice repeats itself - - " Now I know . . . . Now I know . . . . . Now I know . . . . " One of the soldiers , a suspicious and particularly feral brute , Blackie , slowly traces the music to its source , uncovers the record player and says in his working-class New York accent , " Now we BOTE know , " and flings Kaye against the bulkhead . It's an engaging movie , well worth catching if it's on , and suitable for family viewing . ( Never mind that gesture during Kaye's gibberish song . )
441785	819382	22286	8.0	An Original Ethnic Mobster .	Compared to Mervyn LeRoy's " Little Caesar " , " The Public Enemy " is a little more - - well , I don't want to use the word " sophisticated " because it's anything but that . It's more - - developmental . Yes , that's the word . Little Caesar's character begins and ends as an adult gangster . Tom Powers ( Jimmy Cagney ) is first introduced as a young boy , hanging around with his pal Matt Doyle ( Edward Woods ) , being whupped for stealing by his policeman father . The stern old man uses a razor strap . Maybe today it looks like child abuse to some people but it was probably common enough at the time . My mother used to break Kochloevels over my back . In any case , such punishment did neither Tom Powers nor myself any good since we both turned out wicked . Tom and Matt grow up into young men who are hoodlums in the employ of Puttynose , who teaches them the tricks of the trade , an Irish Fagin , but he breaks his promise and skips out on them when they need his help . Years later , an unforgiving Tom wreaks his revenge on the pathetic Puttynose . Then Tom and Matt are taken under the wing of Paddy Ryan , and finally Samuel " Nails " Nathan , both of whom treat our protagonists well . In fact , I rather liked Nails . He's cheerful , generous , and loyal . I mean , considering that he's a gangster , a thief , and a murderer . When Nails is thrown from his horse and killed , Tom and Matt sensibly shoot the horse . There's a sub-plot involving some dames the two guys pick up in a speakeasy . Matt marries his moll but Tom gets tired of his ( Mae Clarke ) and puts finito to their affair by shoving a grapefruit in her face . Mr . Nice Guy . Tom then meets Jean Harlow and she seems to fall for him , although his interest in her is rather more glandular than anything else . She doesn't make herself available in the sense that his other girl friends have and Tom is tearing his hair out , uttering hoarse , goaty cries : " A guy could go screwy from this . " Her part is kind of small and Tom never does get it on with her . When a rival gang kills his friend Matt , Tom picks up two pistols , barges into the gang's hangout , and shoots it out with them , severely wounded in the process . He's visited in the hospital by his Ma , his moralistic brother , and his sister-in-law , and he asks them to forgive him . Doesn't do him any good . The rival gang kidnaps him from the hospital and delivers him to his home , full of new lead . Like " Little Caesar , " this film gives us many scenes and characters that were to become icons . On their first big job , a friend of Tom's and Matt's , Loopy Louie , is shot by the cops and we see the wake in Louie's parlor , with a matronly immigrant mother moaning , " He was always a good boy . " To a parking valet , Tom snaps , " Hey , watch it . Dat car's got gears . It ain't no Ford . " As for the performances , Edward Wood was famously intended to play the lead before the roles were switched , with Cagney taking the role of Tom . It was a good decision . Matt is likable but a little wooden , whereas Cagney sizzles on screen . Jean Harlow's every line is laugh worthy . Like Cagney , she was from New York but her accent here stops just short of a parody of British . " I cahn't . " And , " Me neyether . " Also , she looks , well , BIG in this movie , maybe because she's paired with Cagney , but it's not just that she's as tall as he is but that she's zoftig too , a bit more broad of beam than has been noticeable in her other films . The censors were beginning to impose their will on the film industry , so every shooting takes place off screen and there is virtually no blood . I guess the code was not yet firm enough in place to prevent the presentation of a tailor as a homosexual . When Cagney is being fitted for his first suit , he tugs at his waist and tells the guy to leave plenty of room in their . " Here's where you need extra room , " says the tailor , squeezing Cagney's upper arm , " Just feel that muscle . " Cagney minces away from the encounter . Not that there's any suggestion of homosexual bonds between Tom Powers and Matt Doyle . They're just friends who grew up together . You must see this movie if you haven't already . It was one of three that set the genre firmly on its feet in the early 1930s , the others being " Little Caesar " and " Scarface . " Look at it this way . Without these films , we might never have had " The Godfather . "
442858	819382	516948	8.0	Tis a far , far better episode .	I find this one of the more enjoyable entries in the series . It aired on Christmas day and is built around a story in which Steed and Mrs . Peel are invited to a Dickensian Christmas party at one of England's stately homes , owned by Mervyn Johns , who is a renowned collector of Dickensiana . At the Christmas Eve party , everyone must dress in costumes derived from one or another of the novels . Mrs . Peel winds up as Oliver Twist . Steed , ominously , is assigned the identity of Sidney Carton of " A Tale of Two Cities , " the debauched alcoholic who recovers his humanity in time to sacrifice his life for someone else . The plot , what there is of it , has something to do with drugs , mental telepathy , hypnosis , induced dreams , premonitions , and wringing state secrets out of Steed's mind . The Sidney Carton business has nothing to do with the story and is simply an excuse to film a nightmare and have a few subtle jokes . Especially appealing is the notion of the Dickensian Christmas with its punch , puddings , and roast goose . There's a fireplace and a fiddler playing jigs . The set decorator deserves a two-shilling emolument . It's curious that the Dickens collector who has laid on this affair is Mervyn Johns . This is the Mervyn Johns who dreamed " The Dead of Night " in its entirety . That's a movie I would recommend watching if you really want to be spooked . And a tip : A slight chemical alteration of the mind , and the film will REALLY make your hair stand on end .
442578	819382	452623	8.0	Truth and Consequences	Some keen dialog here . Boston policeman , Ed Harris , to Private Investigator , Casey Affleck : " Look , just forget what I said the other night and we'll be friends . " Affleck : " And if I don't ? " Harris : " That's not the kind of ' if ' you want to bring into your life . " It's the story of a three-year-old girl apparently kidnapped from her single mother , Amy Ryan . Ryan's sister hires two amateur young sleuths from the neighborhood , Affleck and Michelle Monaghan , to poke around and see if they can turn up any leads on the girl's whereabouts . The police , Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman , as a captain in the BPD , cooperate reluctantly . The cops advise Affleck to give up the search because the girl must be dead , but he and his partner persist , leading to a couple of deaths , including that of the child who is evidently drowned in a quarry . Some time passes . A friend gives Affleck a hint about a child molester . Affleck calls Harris and as they approach the house , more shootings and deaths occur . I'm being deliberately vague because this plot is full of twists and odd plot turns , many of the most important ones revealed in momentary flashbacks . The result of this directorial decision , unless my brain is turning to tofu , is some confusion about the details of events . Anyway , I'll let the plot go at this point . The general impression a viewer gets from the movie is that Boston , the city that gave us Paul Revere , Benjamin Franklin , Indian pudding and the baked bean , is now about as ugly and dangerous a place as New York City . This is a very naturalistic movie , meaning you don't get to see any ritzy restaurants , there is no shot of the Old North Church , and nobody goes water skiing on the North Shore . The F word is used exactly one million , two hundred , and three times . I counted . There is little bonhomie . Most of the people seem to slouch around in black Gothic rags with crucifixes or St . Christopher medallions used as fashion accents . A goodly number smoke marijuana ( Gasp ! ) or snort coke , even after it spills on the floor . Bad guys may die , but so do good guys , and some of the best of the good guys wind up in the slams for reasons that are at best arguable . And that's the crux of the film - - that arguable quality . Should a person live according to inflexible principles that may be too lofty for practical use ? Would you insist on telling the truth , though the heavens fall ? ( See " Prince of the City " for an examination of a similar dilemma . ) More specifically , if you found a child who had been kidnapped by a loving family , would you insist that she be returned to her immoral and uncaring biological mother , knowing that in doing so you would see the law upheld but would be consigning the child to an almost certainly wrecked life ? Casey Affleck is the central figure , and he provides a sketchy narration . It's hard to judge his performance . He displays little range but maybe that's how he's decided to draw the character . His voice has all the semihemidemiquavers of Jimmy Stewart's but none of the expressiveness . Morgan Freeman is impressive , as always , a sublime actor . Michelle Monaghan's character seems to be in the film in order to prove that Affleck is heterosexual and to provide him with something to risk losing . The best performance may be given by Amy Ryan as the child's flawed mother . It's a most difficult role , too . Ryan has to walk a fine line between genuine but fleeting motherly instincts and frivolous self indulgence on the other . It's hard to see how anyone could have done better than she did . Ed Harris does well , too , as the cop who is willing to recognize a distinction between formal principle and pragmatism , and to be willing to sacrifice for a good that is outside the law . But then everyone is pretty good . Not a sour note in the bunch . Warning : Children under the age of 35 may fall asleep . This movie is made for adults . Shots are fired in only two scenes , and they are mostly pops and flashes in the background . There is no sex or nudity . There are long scenes in which nobody wrenches someone else's head off and pees down his neck cavity . They just sit and talk . The film doesn't provide instant gratification - - not during the meandering unfolding of the plot , nor at the end . Ben Affleck directed . He needs a little seasoning but his judgment is generally good . The script is a bit weak in presenting us with that dilemma , by the way . The protagonist is in a quandary over whether to punish good guys for breaking the law in order to achieve a greater good . But that makes him more than ordinarily extrapunitive . After all , earlier he murdered a helpless child molester and THAT doesn't seem to bother him much . He's better at forgiving himself than at forgiving others . The script kind of skips over that little problem . See it if you can . You won't wind up whistling a happy tune but you might find yourself wondering about the issues raised here .
442746	819382	391024	8.0	Perception and Substance	They are a horde of sand monkeys screaming hysterically , jumping up and down , waving their fists in the air , and they all have their heads wrapped in tablecloths stolen from Italian restaurants - - right ? Well , not quite , according to this documentary from Noujaim , which focuses on the producers and staff of the much-maligned al Jaziera satellite news channel which broadcasts to the Arab-speaking world . The reporter we get to know best , a big guy who looks like Luciano Pavarotti in makeup for a performance of Otello , and who speaks English fluently ( his wife is an Englishwoman ) , is like most other reporters of whatever channel or nationality - - practical , cynical , and good humored . He doesn't give us an anti-American diatribe . He's way too cool for that . He's watching , for instance , the tape of a demonstration in which yelling , leaping children surround some Americans entering Baghdad and he's listening to the English translation . The children are shouting " Allah " something or other and the on screen translator comments that the kids are saying " God be with you Americans ! " The reporter smiles and turns to the camera , explaining that what the kids are actually saying is , " God damn you Americans . " He has a keen sense of irony . So does another translator who is watching Bush's " Mission Accomplished " speech on live TV and giving the Arabic translation to the audience . When Bush is finally finished telling us how successful we and our allies have been , how the war has ended , the translator shuts off his mike , lowers his face and wordlessly chuckles . At another point , after the victory , Iraqis are seen breaking into a bank , emerging which armfuls of money , which they then gleefully tear up and toss in the air . Watching this on TV an al Jaziera staff member remarks that these are Kurds and they're tearing up the dough because it's the new Dinar with Saddam's picture , and in that region they've always used the old pre-1991 currency . At the same time , elsewhere , an American newsman ( from CNN , I think ) is watching the scene and calls to someone to find out what it is these looters are tearing up . Is it money , or what ? And when asked at a briefing to explain why these looting incidents are going on in the destroyed and chaotic cities , an American general replies that this was going on under the noses of the Iraqis themselves . ( In other words , some Iraqi authority should have put a stop to it . ) But the film makers are mistaken if they think that most of this isn't already known to American audiences . The problem isn't so much that American audiences were ignorant of some of these things , but that they preferred the perception to the substance . Take the concept of victory . The perception is " the liberated people " pulling down a statue of the reviled Hussein . That's part of the substance too . Another part of the substance is videotape of dead and bloody American bodies sprawled on a cement floor , a part that , like the coffins arriving at Dover AFB , we'd rather exclude . Al Jaziera showed both scenes . I don't mean any of this to sound too simple minded . It's a thorny problem . Exactly how do you edit the substance so that what appears in the media is acceptable - - in the sense that it doesn't get you fired or killed . The journalist's code of course is to be " objective , " but objectivity itself depends on perception . A sympathetic Marine captain , seen in several interviews , doing his best to answer unanswerable questions , poses the conundrum in its most basic form . Something like , " I was watching American TV and saw shots of these bodies of dead civilians , including kids , and I thought , that's too bad . Then I ate dinner and went to sleep . Recently I was watching al Jaziera and saw shots of bodies of dead American GIs , and I really got MAD . Then I thought , maybe THEY feel the same way . " The officer is a surprisingly earnest guy in an impossible job . He's trying to learn Arabic , is terribly flattered when asked to come home and have dinner with Pavarotti and his English wife . His happiness at being treated amicably is almost palpable . If you put the wrong material on the air , you're liable to pay for it . Al Jaziera's headquarters in Baghdad was bombed during the war and one of its reporters killed . Another Arab news agency was bombed at the same time , and a hotel too . The financial reporter from al Jaziera was banned from the New York Stock Exchange too . ( Not mentioned in this film . ) We're going to have to wait for another documentary to explain the reasons for that , I guess .
441929	819382	265459	8.0	Behind the smiley face .	SPOILERS . Freud called it " sublimation " when you convert your neurotic anxiety into a constructive channel such as your work or your art , and that's what Robin Williams shows his character doing here , in a fine subdued dramatic performance . People bring their film to him to be developed in the SavMart . And although he's nothing more than a smiley face to them , they are much more to him . He knows them all , their quirks , their joys , and their families . In fact he runs off an extra copy of family photos - - children playing , wedding ceremonies , vacations , the usual dull stuff - - and takes them home and tapes them across an entire wall of his apartment . When he's not watching The Simpsons ( a family show ) on TV , he's sitting back in his chair glowing with pleasure as he looks at his wall . Not that he's entirely happy . He laments the fact ( in a literate and observant narration ) that if we were to judge families just from the snapshots they take , it would be misleading . People just take snaps of joyous moments . They neglect everyday subjects like the used bandaid , the wasp on the jello , the edges of the sofa cushions - - things nobody pays attention to , like himself . What a well-done movie for a first-time director . One notices first the use of lighting and color . The SavMart in which Williams works is all fluorescent light and sterility - - the dominant hues are blue , white , and cream . The only advancing colors we see , warm reds and oranges , are associated with the family that occupies most of his attention , the Yorkins . His home , like his workplace , is so sterile and tidy that it makes an ordinary space look like McSorley's Old Ale House . The family snaps bloom like a spring garden of flamelike orange . The wall that they cover is the only sign of life in Williams ' home , aside from the pet hamster that runs endless miles in its silly circular cage . If the film were any more " symbolic " it would have to be European . The actors wear matching wardrobes . Williams ' uniform is flawless for its purpose . A blue vest , starchy gray shirt and matching tie , gray trousers , and a pair of those ugly plastic shoes with thick gum soles - - all gray . Williams is first-rate in the part , not just his bland professional behind-the-counter smile or his tentative voice but his movements , his body language . It's stilted , stiff , robotic , as if requiring an immense amount of effort to control . The black detective is good as well , if more sympathetic than we'd expect from an ordinary cop . And so is Connie Nielson , whom Williams takes to following around . ( Why not ? ) The director has done a fine job . Camera movements are generally measured pans , and shots are held for enough time for us to absorb their contents . ( What a relief after having been so often zapped in recent movies . ) The influence of David Lynch , the Coen brothers , and Stanley Kubrick is there - - but not to an objectionable extent . The director is fond of the kind of brightly lighted scenes that Kubrick used to find so attractive . ( See the scene between Nicholson and the waiter in the men's room in " The Shining " for an example of what I mean . ) Originality shows in this movie . A less thoughtful flick would have - - could EASILY have - - included the butchery of two guilty people in the nude . Or - - when Williams has a nightmare - - he COULD have screamed , shot up from his bed , and shoved his face jarringly into the camera , but he doesn't . The nightmare , by the way , has blood squirting in buckets from Williams ' eyes . There are lots of eyes in this movie . Williams at one point interrupts a lecture on eye surgery . And lots of camera lenses . The only thing that leave me puzzled a bit is the denouement , in which Williams quizzes the black detective and tells him he's a good father , and that he'd never make his children do sick things . Williams ' face twists with angry distress as he says this , and the detective comments , " I think I understand , Sy . " I'd rather NOT understand , if what we're meant to understand is that Williams ' father was a child abuser . That's too cheap a shot to fit into the rest of this superior story .
442581	819382	73540	8.0	" There's some questions that has answers , and others don't . "	What a movie . Australia started come out with films that received worldwide attention in the early 1980s , with " The Last Wave " , and a cascade of them has followed , from the raucous " Mad Max " to more contemplative issues . And on top of that , they've been putting out a horde of toothsome blonds , from Olivia Newton John to Nicole Kidman . GOOD ON YA , MATE ! When it comes to magnificently featured blonds , Anne-Louise Lambert , as Miranda , will serve in " Picnic at Hanging Rock . " It's true she's a bit tender , only in her mid-teens like the other girls at Mrs . Appleyard's ( Rachel Roberts ' ) expensive boarding school in rural Victoria . But the fact is that the film is full to the brim with budding but repressed sexuality - - repression of all kinds , in fact , with all that strict discipline and formality . Even one of the other students seems to have a crush on Miranda . So blame Joan Lindsay and Cliff Green , the writers , instead of my own admittedly warped interests . All is not well at the Appleyard School . The continent at the time was nothing much more than an English outlier and the school has imported its parent culture wholesale - - the strict class system , everything . It's already old fashioned . And it's feeling the financial pinch too . All Mrs . Appleyard needs is some kind of scandal , and that's what happens . The girls go on a picnic to nearby Hanging Rock , a jagged jumble of bushes and gray boulders with stucco textures sticking up out of nowhere . A handful of girls , including Miranda , decides to climb to the top . A plump whiny girl follows and when she tires she loses contact with the others . Panic - - in self-disciplined British style - - follows when the other four fail to return . A search is implemented . Bloodhounds , aboriginal trackers , but there is no trace of the girls . After a day or two , one girl is finally retrieved in an unconscious state and brought back to the school . She's out of it because of exposure and shock , but she is at least " intact " , as the doctor puts it , although there is some mystery about why her shoes and stockings are missing , and why she isn't wearing the corset that is part of the girls ' uniforms . No trace of the others is ever found . The affair effectively brings about the end of Mrs . Appleyard and her boarding school . Not much of a story , is it ? A couple of girls go missing from a school and that's that . Not a drop of blood in sight . Not a single motorcycle roar within hearing . And yet the film seems pregnant with a sense of languorous dread , of something that is not quite right , cockeyed , off kilter . We can sense it from the very beginning , with a score drawn from Beethoven and with Zamphir's Peruvian nose flute or whatever it is . When there is no music on the sound track we can hear the buzzing of flies or the soft growls of wind about the stone mansion . Why , when Miranda is leaving for the picnic , does she tell another that she's not coming back . And after all , what DID happen to those missing girls ? Applause for director Peter Weir and for others of his ilk , like Nicholas Roeg , who have the courage to put out a movie that isn't all hustle and bustle , that takes care to establish an atmosphere that is almost a character in itself , that lingers over the contrast between elegant , lacy civilization and the indifferent impudence of nature's raw rocks . Everything that happens has its exact time and its exact place , one of the characters insists repeatedly , and the world of movies but have a place for films like this that challenge and mystify rather than placate .
442624	819382	46876	8.0	Classic of its inexpensive kind .	A couple of scientists hire a fishing boat to take them up a tributary of the Amazon to capture a living fossil . Some of them get away . That's about it for the plot , which I'm sure must be adequately described elsewhere . Just a few rambling comments seem called for . In Samoa there are tidal pools sprinkled among the jagged lava rocks of the coast , ranging in size from goldfish bowls to bathtubs . The natives have a substance similar to the one used in this movie to disable the gill man . I forget what it's called in Samoan but it's English name is something similar to rotinone . You scrape it into the water from a seed the size of a walnut . The Samoans use it to make the fish jump out of the pools . It doesn't make them groggy , as in the movie . It irritates the hell out of them and prompts them to leap out of the pool . This is both good and bad . Some of the tropical fish are colorful and shaped like boxes . I hated seeing them so irritated . But the mud skippers , an inch or two long and of an undistinguished gray , although they look exactly like fish , act more like tiny frogs . They don't need any initial prompting . They pop out of the pools and sit on rocks and look at you with their goggle eyes . I didn't mind their being irritated . " Those eyes - - those staring eyes ! " Of course I realize there are good and bad among mud skippers , as there are among humans . Fossils . The scientists discover a fossil buried in a river bank . The fossil is rubbery . That means it is no fossil at all . Fossilization is a very complicated process in which each cell of the original tissue is replaced by a mineral compound , I think mostly some compound of calcium . Any real fossil is going to be made of rock . It won't flap when you wave it . And after a couple of million years it would have been disarticulated . But they got the fingers right . Five on each hand , or flipper , or pseudopod . A host of creatures probably crawled out of the primordial sea and were complicated enough to develop endoskeletal limbs . Some may have had two fingers , others ten . They all died out except the ones that just happened to have five digits . Now everything that has a skeleton and limbs with digits have five digits - - from humans to horses to bats to whales . The gill man may have been an evolutionary dead end but his family tree didn't branch off from the trunk until after those five digits had become the received number , early on . He has a thumb too , but it's not opposable like ours but rather more like an orangutan's . He'll have a good power grip but no precision grip . He may be a terrific swimmer but he'll never fix your TV set if it requires a screwdriver . And he'll have to hold a pencil like the handle of a hammer . Julia Adams . Why does she insist on wearing these tight shorts that simply serve to emphasize her succulent rear ? No wonder the gill man is after her . Any normal male would immediately want to jump on her and pinch her . But then , as far as that goes , what did the gill man have in mind for her ? Cross-generic reproduction isn't possible . Had the same problem with King Kong . For 1954 you weren't likely to find a sexier scene that Julia Adams with her dark , Audrey-Hepburn eyebrows swimming along the surface while the gill man swims in a suggestive position beneath her . The gill man may be a primitive evolutionary dead end , but he's nobody's fool . And what is he doing all alone in the Black Lagoon ? Is he the last living specimen ? If not , where is the breeding pool ? The plot is full of such holes . For what it's worth , the heavy here is not so much the gill man as Mark ( Richard Denning ) , who wants to kill him and bring him home as a trophy and as proof that the creature exists . The same argument is advanced now - - in real life - - about Bigfoot , if it exists at all . And Bigfoot , if the tales are to be believed , is a primate . Just like us . Back to the movie . It's an original , directed by Jack Arnold , king of the monster movies , and brought out by Universal Studios . I enjoy it on those occasions when it's on . It lacks all pretension and is simple minded , yet it's engaging . There isn't a dull moment in it and very little complexity to befoul our enjoyment of this simple cartoonish tale . Well worth seeing .
442763	819382	78326	9.0	Fine Film	Spoilers . There are so many things that seem ( to a viewer , anyway , if not an ex-inmate ) exactly right . I won't go over the story , since that's been adequately limned . But let me mention the makeup and wardrobe . What unspeakable sleaze . Hoffman's mustache looks like it belong on some grubneck posing for a mug shot . And Gary Busey's long hair is combed straight back in a most unkempt way . And - - this is splendid - - his KID'S hair is cut and groomed exactly the same way ! The wardrobe reeks of those kinds of stores one finds in the tenderloin sections of LA , where the cheap colorful shirt , made in Thailand or Ceylon or someplace , hang from a wheeled bar out on the sidewalk , and the shop window has a sign taped on it in red letters - - SALE 99 CENTS . The locations were equally well chosen . Hoffman finds a room in a kind of single-room-occupany place that passes for a dump in LA . ( It would be a mansion in New York . ) The room is neat and sparsely furnished and the sheets are clean , but you can practically smell the stale odor of peeling paint and aging varnish , and everyone who lives there is a loser . One imagines a lot of bottles of cheap vodka stashed in a lot of bureau drawers in this place , and the bathroom is always down the hall . The performances are uniformly first rate , with the possible exception of Theresa Russel , who is a hottie , no doubt about it , but doesn't bring much in the way of expressiveness to her role . Hoffman is superb as a slightly dumb , impulsive , but street smart thief . Gary Busey couldn't be better as his well-meaning but unreliable friend . And Harry Dean Stanton is equally good , as usual , as the poor guy whose soul cries out to be illegal while he soldiers on in his bland Southern California upper-prole simulacrum of a home , eating the most unappetizing grilled hamburgers you can dream up , and wistfully playing his guitar and signing , " Hand me down . . . my walkin ' cane . " Oh , how desperately he needs that cane . " I gotta get outta here , " he moans . I've always kind of like Emmet Walsh's performances , whether he's a heavy or not . He comes through quite well here as a P . O . whose surface friendliness conceals , not the mean streak we might expect , but a " just business " attitude towards his clients . The writers must have disliked his character because they have him humiliated by winding up handcuffed bareassed to a freeway fence , a fate he didn't deserve . What do you expect from a parole officer , Father Flannagan ? Iconography and performances aside , the movie has interesting points and an interesting theme . There are basically two family scenes : first , when Hoffman visits Busy , and second when Hoffman visits Stanton . Both exude a sense of ordinary everyday life - - routine and boring . Busey's family is the more interesting . He apologizes to his little boy for something he said or did earlier . We don't find out what he's apologizing for ; we're left to think it over . Nice touch . A more barbaric writer and director would have spelled it out . " Remember last night when I whupped you and called you a wuss ? Well , I didn't really mean it . " Of course that's not the way life works . Hoffman , like the rest of us , enters a family in medias res , walks into an ongoing domestic play somewhere maybe in the middle of Act Two , Scene Three , without knowing what's preceded the current goings on . Kathy Bates , her weight more closely approximating the ideal that our narcissistic culture now demands , has a sensitive and nicely executed exchange with Hoffman while her husband is out of the room , telling Hoffman it would be better if he didn't come around anymore , and showing genuine regret while saying so . But the more dramatic moments are well done too . Hoffman trying to hold up a Korean grocer with an old faulty revolver that is falling apart while he holds the owners at bay . ( The thing looks more like a cap pistol than a real gun , about as threatening as an angora pussycat . ) Hoffman smashing and smashing and continuing to smash glass cases in a jewelry store while Stanton throws up his hands in disgust and shouts about how unprofessional Hoffman is . The backyard chase after the robbery and Hoffman shooting blindly through a wooden fence . I can't think offhand of any other movie that has made me feel quite so thoroughly sucked into a life of thievery and murder , that has made the progression from ex-con trying to hold a straight job , to fugitive murderer , seem so inexorable . And yet we never feel exactly sympathetic towards Hoffman's character , except at the very end when , before the end credits , we see a succession of mug shots of Hoffman , a half dozen or so dissolving into one another , each face looking younger and more innocent than the last , but each equally without hope . I think one of the reasons we don't feel sorry for Hoffman is that the whole botched affair is really his own fault . Asked earnestly not to visit Busey again , he nevertheless not only contact him but draws him into the final robbery , without informing his partner Stanton . And , after all , if Hoffman had adhered to the original plan of the robbery , he and Stanton would in all likelihood have gotten away with it , even in the face of Busey's failure . Hoffman sees none of this . He blames Busey for everything , including the Stanton's death , and murders him coldly . And for all his street smarts , he's not very clever in dealing with secondary institutions like the Bureau of Parole . On the freeway , Walsh is trying to wheedle some information out of him , and Hoffman suddenly turns with a feral rage and begins punching Walsh in the head and forcing the car off the freeway . That's no way to treat people . This is a good crime story . It isn't a simple caper flick . There is a good deal of character built into the people we see here . Grosbard hasn't directed in a flashy , gory style , either . There is virtually no blood . No trick shots . No car chases . No stunts . No exploding fireballs . And no automatic weapons . There is only Hoffman , emerging from the prison shower after being booked for violation of his parole , one pink naked body in a line of unpleasant pink naked bodies , waiting to be deloused with a powder spray , everybody's privates now made public . That one scene of the prison shower tells us volumes more about the world Hoffman calls home than any number of squib charges could .
442284	819382	34891	9.0	Fine cast in unimpeachable film .	Noel Coward is usually associated with bright bubbly comedies and musicals but here , as director and star in a flag-waving British war movie , he plays it straight , so to speak , muting the plummier aspects of his elocution . But , his splendid and reserved performance notwithstanding , this isn't really his picture alone . Coward turned most of the directing over to his editor David Lean , giving Lean's career a good punt . And this is an ensemble film from beginning to end . The cast , both male and female , is filled with familiar faces for 1942 , or faces that would later become familiar . Sir Dickie Attenborough is a barely recognizable youth . Even Juliet Mills is in it , as a neonate . It's nicely written too , carefully weaving together the stories of multiple characters , built around the birth and death of a British destroyer , HMS Torrin , during the early years of the war . There's action enough to keep a viewer interested , though the Battle of Britain and Dunkirk are mostly off screen . And the ladies on the home front knit in a nervous frenzy while bombs fall about and kill some of them . A nice understated scene in which John Mills tells a shipmate , Bernard Miles , that the latter's wife and mother were killed in the Blitz . Miles thanks Mills , excuses himself , and goes on deck to look at the sky . He doesn't weep . Nobody weeps . It's called keeping a stiff upper lip . The fact is that men inducted into the service must learn how to act like soldiers and sailors . And in wartime civilians too must learn how to act as proper civilians . Servicemen see training films on such interesting subjects as how to disassemble an assault rifle and how to avoid VD , or , pardon , sexually transmitted diseases . And in its own way , " In Which We Serve " is a training film too . Civilians needed films like this one to learn their roles thoroughly too . Basically the lesson taught by " In Which We Serve " is that one of the best ways to cope with rationing was to make wisecracks about it , that the two greatest and most important pleasures were supporting the war effort and enjoying visits home when they were available , and when things got too serious you tried to keep your distress to yourself . Everybody knew what you were feeling because , after all , loss was common currency and was ignorant of differences in social class . Fine job , even the inexpensive special effects .
441712	819382	265086	9.0	Mission Impossible	This is a very difficult film to evaluate . I'm not sure exactly how closely the narrative follows the historical facts , for one thing . Certainly some of the dialog is fictional , but it's less the dialog than the layout of the situation that needs to be understood , and the movie is weak on that point . One of the docuchannels , perhaps Discovery , showed a two-hour special on this incident , shortly after the movie was released . The documentary is a lot easier to understand than the movie itself . I emphasize historical accuracy because the rest of the film is fairly competent and doesn't need much in the way of comment . No real acting is called for . The photography is adequate , tinted beige with flying dust during daylight sequences , almost as much as silent films might have been , and a sort of sickly green at night . I had a very hard time keeping up with the location of the various units , or remnants of units , and with just exactly who was who , except for Sam Shepherd who is easily identifiable . The special effects were up to what one would expect of an expensive modern movie . There was an abundance of realistic gore , of bullets clanking off metal , and so forth . Maybe a bit too much . It was inevitable that " Saving Private Ryan " would initiate a new level of graphic violence . The movie delineates four groups of people . ( 1 ) The heroic American elite units , Rangers and Delta Force . ( 2 ) The villainous , practically cannibalistic rabble of the Somali " militia . " ( 3 ) The resentful and reluctantly cooperative Pakistanis . And ( 4 ) the Somali civilians who are suffering the most . It's a brave film because its subject is an uninvited intervention in a remote anarchistic country done for humanitarian reasons , and it was a failure . We were supposed to relieve starvation and introduce order into a social universe of moral nihilism . I remember feeling that we were going to have trouble getting along in this place that nobody had ever heard of when clips were shown on TV news of Marines standing guard on trucks that were trundling along the unpaved streets . A handful of laughing skinny kids were running alongside the trucks and knocking cartons of food off into the dust . The angry Marines , used to more discipline , were swatting and shouting at the children . For the first few days , the " militia " lay low . ( " Militia " is in quotes because they weren't militia , just warring factions led by charismatic leaders . ) After they realized they weren't going to be annihilated , that the UN actually DIDN'T intend to kill everyone and take over , they emerged from hiding doing what they did best , running around with automatic weapons , often mounted on the beds of old pick-ups , and shooting at one another . Well , this was what we had come to stop , right ? According to respectable reports in the New Yorker and elsewhere , it was decided on our part that the biggest nuisance of all was one particular warlord . He , out of many contenders , was identified as the " enemy " and it was seen as necessary to arrest him , if we could find him first . The search and the attempt at capture , which this movie depicts , seems largely to have been done out of rage and frustration . Well , we didn't get the guy we were after , since this wasn't fiction . And we lost eighteen American men ( all enlisted men ) , and the Pakistanis lost two dozen as well , though the film doesn't mention it . I was gripped by the movie from beginning to end . What I took away from it was a feeling that there are simply some missions that are impossible . After all , our most highly trained troops took high tech weapons of all sorts and deployed them against a horde of disorganized hostiles armed with nothing more than small arms and grenades launchers . And we sent our men into a country in which little laughing kids could PO the Marines , a country we understood nothing about , against an " enemy " that ourselves had defined , in a city in which we didn't know our way around . George F . Will put it very well : " We have no obligation to do that which is impossible . " The Gulf War of course was a much larger military enterprise . And when we think of the last war we fought , we think of our overwhelming victory there . I wish that every living person who hungers for war at this moment could see " Blackhawk Down " so that they could envisage a different scenario , a different set of scenes than our airplanes bombing missile bases amidst pretty fireworks , our tanks blowing the hatches off those of the bad guys . It's possible that instead of ending in a quick victory , our next military intervention may end up tragically , more of a bloody nose than an adrenalin rush .
442767	819382	62765	10.0	Sui generis	I don't know how this film can be criticized as " dated , " except in the most superficial sense of the word . It stands by itself . There hasn't been another movie quite like it , before or since . Essentially a straightforward tale of a policeman unraveling a gangster plot , it alternates between trouvee scenes that look and sound as unrehearsed as real life , and spectacular moments involving chases and shootings . It's still a highly stylized film of course . Every shot change but one is a cut , not a fade or dissolve . Most people speak more lines when found in Steve McQueen's circumstances , or so I would think . Most men don't come home to find Jackie Bissett asleep in their beds , a pity . There has probably never been a pursuit like that filmed in the hills of Colma , which is known locally as " the city that waits for the city that waits to die , to die . " I once saw a high-speed pursuit in the streets of Philadelphia and was amazed at how slowly and carefully both the police and their quarry were driving - - slowing down for stop signs and all that . When the broth is reduced , the plot isn't unlike many John Wayne movies . He's a loner , dedicated to his job , living an otherwise uneventful life in a modest apartment , except for one thing , Jacqueline Bissett . His other contacts are distant or perfunctory . His relationship with Don Gordon is defined in the first few minutes as strictly professional , nothing more . He's respected but not loved until Bissett appears in his life . How did he get that way ? Who knows ? Who CARES , really ? A person's development can't be explained in a few minutes of screen time , even if we knew what caused it , without recourse to revelations that have always been clichés - - he had zits during adolescence , or they took away his sled when he was just a kid . Not even cheap shots at sympathy mongering - - he lost his wife recently - - are brought in . Bissett is important to the plot because she represents the possibility of his returning to the human race as a person capable of warm and deeply emotional relationships , however clumsy his expressions of warmth may still be . The conflict between McQueen and Bissett involves her inability to accept the gruesome aspects of the life he leads , a common device . ( See John Wayne and Patricia Neal in " Operation Pacific , " or Al Pacino and Diane Venora in " Heat " . ) Bissett finally yields and accepts the conditions . Any other ending would have been pretty bleak ( she leaves him and he becomes even more bitter and lonely as he ages ) or unbelievable ( he resigns from the SFPD and becomes a Zen Buddhist monk ) . Superficially it seems that McQueen has " won " the contest , but actually it is Bissett who comes out as the more admirable , flexible , capable of changing and adapting , open to further development in her interests . And as far as that goes , the movie ends ambiguously . Bissett has come back to him , but as McQueen puts his gun aside and washes his face in the bathroom he looks up and stares in the mirror , expressionless . If he doesn't change , the relationship with Bissett is in jeopardy . She will continue to embrace life ( I'm glad I don't have to try defining a term like that ) while leaving him behind . The movie was released in 1968 , probably shot in 1967 , the height of Haight-Ashbury and the flower power movement . If this movie were as dated as some people think , the writers and Yates would have worked in a bunch of timely but far from timeless hippies and their lore . The temptation must have been there but was successfully resisted . The city is used iconically and without touristy shots . Nothing has dated , except that Enrico's is now closed . McQueen unholsters his pistol only once , and fires only two shots . If it were done today , can you imagine the final shootout without the hero and villain using two Uzis each and puncturing every wall , shattering every mirror , and exploding every squib in sight ? The car chase now looks familiar , of course , because it has been imitated a hundred times since " Bullitt " appeared . Around the time of " The Seven Ups , " they got tired of just using cars and worked in elevated subway trains , garbage trucks , buses , motorcycles , and so on . The imitations now seem dated in a way this movie simply does not . Whatever happened to our sense of historical depth ? This was a breakthrough film and it remains one . Final note : Watch the crane shot near the end as the 707 is recalled to its perch at the terminal . The camera glides down and allows the nose of the airplane to fill the screen , jigging slightly on his shock absorders , its windshields like eyes , its bulbous black radar dome like the nose on the face of a clown , a hideous and frightening clown . It's a magnificent shot .
443001	819382	84855	10.0	In Primis	This one really isn't to be missed , certainly among the best of the courtroom dramas . The acting . Well , first of all , nobody is bad . The most nearly negligible performance is by Wesley Addy , who at least looks the part of the elegant doctor and who is a competent actor . The other principals are outstanding . Charlotte Rampling with that odd face - - sultriness imposed kicking and screaming upon boniness - - is unusually good and even manages to project a kind of believable guilty remorse , which has never been her strong suit . James Mason is ( almost ) unflappable as Concannon , attorney for the defense . Marvelous , the way he puts quotation marks around the word " expert " while questioning the plaintiff's witness . Edward Binns is stolid as the savvy but moral bishop who wants to wrap things up without making waves . " What is the truth ? " , he asks Newman . Jack Warden is plumply likable , as always . He's seems to have aged more than Binns , with whom he'd worked a quarter of a century earlier in " Twelve Angry Men . " Lindsay Crouse in a small but crucial role is appealingly Irish . Milo O'Shea is sliminess itself . I don't know why , perhaps his impish accent , but there is always something amusing about him , as if unable to quite shake what Erving Goffman called " role distance , " the knowledge that he's playing a part accompanied by an awareness of the absurdity of doing so . Even Bruce Willis is in this , playing a visitor to the courtroom . I was an atmosphere person in a Boston courtroom too , in " From the Hip " - - a far superior movie . ( Ask anybody . ) And Paul Newman is flawless . Robert Redford was supposed to play Frankie Galvin , but he wouldn't have been up to the part . The role requires the compelling anguish that Newman brings to it , and he does it perfectly . Redford is much too cool for that . I will mention just one scene of Newman's that is emblematic . He stands in his darkened office - - Warden watching soundlessly from the background - - and calls the defendants ' law firm about a settlement they have already withdrawn . He paces around talking into the phone , hardly able to breathe , congested with not just mucous but self hatred , cajoling them , pounding on the desk with his knuckles , filled with an empty bravado . Redford couldn't do it . Practically nobody could do it . Almost everything fits together perfectly in this film . Sidney Lumet opens with a shot of Newman alone in silhouette playing a pinball machine in a Boston bar , drinking beer . The pinball game serves as a token for the trajectory of his life during the course of the film . Wardrobe : first-rate . How " New England . " Multi-layered dark clothing , ( in Newman's case black ) , woolly and fussy . Sound : excellent . Little noises , hardly noticeable , form almost a background score . The old wooden floors creak when people step on them . An example of one or two good creaks : the scene in Concannon's office when he is welcoming Laura back to the law . Twirled-up telephone lines squeak when someone pulls on them . The tinkling of ice cubes in liquor glasses . The heavy breathing of nervous or defeated people . The slamming of ancient desk drawers . Garbage trucks whining in the city streets at dawn . Production design : as good as it gets . Everything looks old , as if it has been used and lived in for years , not shabby but burnished with age , all mahogany wood and scarlet carpets . Lighting and photography : up there with the best . Most scenes are dark - - it's midwinter in Boston - - but not too dark , cleverly lighted . The snow in the streets is literally blue , as if it had just leaped out of an impressionist landscape . Tree branches glisten with moisture on slick night-time streets . Tinsel draped along a bar ceiling twinkles with fraudulent joy . The weakness ? The movie is so good I hate to mention it , but the script leaves something to be desired . It almost betrays the characters . I don't mind the legal absurdities so much . Okay , so things would never really happen this way . The judge would have to grant a continuance and so forth . It's not so much that as the motivation and the set speeches that are bothersome , especially Newman's , and they're critical . The banter and small talk are fine . Mamet's small talk is almost always fine . But Newman's conversion from a drunken , cynical ambulance chaser to a principled attorney of reawakened morals in the course of two-minute photo session with a comatose patient is patently unbelievable . Where did all that conscience ( if that's what it is ? ) suddenly come from ? He flops backwards as if stunned . Why ? The script does its best to back up his epiphany . The images of his patient develop as a real person , not just a dollar sign , on the Polaroid photos , a mirror image of what's going on in his mind . But as Warden repeatedly points out , his job is to win some money for his clients so they can leave their comatose sister in good care and get on with their lives in Tucson . Instead he turns down the church's offer because he sees a trial as a challenge to his personal pride , as a " means of redemption " . ( Is that kind of pride a mortal or a venial sin ? ) He loses sight of what the whole legal process is about because of this self-involvement . It wouldn't be so bad if he realized this , if he found himself in conflict , but in fact he never gives it a thought . Finally , Newman's summation : it sounds as if it had been put together by some high school kid whose homework assignment was to write an essay ( of at least two hundred words ) about " what life means to me . " " I believe there is justice in our hearts , " says Newman , more to himself than to the jury . No kidding . None of this criticism can subtract from all the other virtues of the film . It's among the best of its kind .
