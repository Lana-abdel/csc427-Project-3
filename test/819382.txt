442892	819382	369360	1.0	Ego trip .	Sometimes TV movies seem to do a first-rate job of dealing with social problems . " And the Band Played On " comes to mind , along with others . But this isn't a very good example . AIDS is undeniably there , as is child abuse , while internet predators are problematic . The movie is not badly done . Potts has a winsome hapless face , with over-sized semi-frightened eyes , like a deer caught in the headlights . She's by no means Hollywood gorgeous . I enjoyed her performance . It's the only one that stands out . I'm not sure I believed the script in its entirety . Some of the incidents read too much like submissions to Screenplays 101 . Ms . Posey is wandering through a fairground and putting herself in danger for the sake of justice , wired for sound , with cops listening all over the place as she is drawn into the shadows by an internet predator . A pedestrian bumps into her and jars the microphone loose so it falls to the ground . She then walks out of the fairground not realizing she's trailing a loose wire and is talking to herself . Maybe it happened . Maybe it ALL happened or maybe just some of it happened . It's not a badly done TV movie but it's irritating because the movie seems so determined to whip us into a rage and justify it by such cheap means . One of the problems with using internet predators as villains in the movies - - and there have been several like this - - is that there is so little scientific evidence that they exist . No amount of evidence , or the lack of it , is likely to change the minds of people who are convinced that they are a major social problem . Too bad . The paucity of internet predators ought to ease our anxiety , but somehow we can't seem to do without them .
442072	819382	404456	1.0	Beyond Description	There is a fine movie about the serial murderer Charlie Starkweather and his hostage / girl friend Karil Ann Fugate out there . Its title is " Badlands . " There is also a very good TV movie on the subject , starring Tim Roth . This thing is so bad that no words can describe it . Everything about it is less than poor . It's not just the low budget . With imagination and talent that kind of obstacle can be overcome - - " Mean Streets " , " The Honeymoon Killers , " " The Littlest Fugitive , " " The Savage Eye , " " Detour . " But this abortion lacks not just money but everything . The acting , or rather its absence . Not only isn't there a decent performance from anyone in the cast . Some are so bad that I've seen better in high school productions of " Our Town . " The sheriff is probably the worst , but they're all bad . The editing . Continuing with the sheriff's disarticulation , please note what happens on the screen when he has a line . ( " A line " because he reads them as if they didn't come in packages . ) The camera shows us the sheriff's grim and uninteresting face . Seconds pass . Finally he speaks . " If they want to go out in a blaze o ' glory , this is their chance . " The camera lingers for a few seconds more on his face although he has nothing more to say and the muscles of his face remain marmoreal . After a few scenes like this the effect on the viewer is that of a hypnotic drug - - and not even a good HIGH first , but a precipitate drop in consciousness of the sort you get from chloral hydrate . The direction . Abominable . Nobody can hold a gun still . It must be jerked around or waved from side to side , or jabbed as if shoveling dirt . Even when a lawman takes a bead on a window he waves his rifle as if it were a magician's wand . Location : Not Nebraska farmland but clearly the Mojave Desert in California . I can't go on with this , really . I hate to dump on people and this is no fun . It's more embarrassing than anything else . Reminds me of a professor who once told us that when we wrote our term papers we should do our very best . Then he paused for a moment and mused out loud , " What if you did your very best and it turned out pedestrian ? " Okay . Fair and balanced , right ? There are two valuable things in this movie . There are some nice shots of vintage 1940s and 1950s cars , though sometimes mislabeled . And this film would serve as a very good bad example in any film school .
441895	819382	118571	2.0	Breathtaking compendium of clichés	" The plane is damaged , one of his engines is out , and he's leaking fuel . How can he make it ? " Something like that anyway . The clichés came so thick and fast I couldn't remember them all . I couldn't even GRASP them all quickly enough , piled as they were , one atop the other , like a pile of Leggos . I don't really think it's necessary to bother with the script except to say a rogue group of Russians hijacks Air Force One , is overcome by the President of the United States , and most of the good guys are saved and all of the bad guys perish , usually in some colorful fashion . Wolfgang Petersen made a gripping movie with " Das Boot . " It was a long flick of mostly quiet moments , a leisurely examination of life aboard a U-Boat , punctuated with shocking moments of action . In " Air Force One " Petersen's talents have been - - dare I say " hijacked " by Hollywood ? There is no leisurely examination of anything . There is neither leisure nor examination . All the parts that might bore a twelve-year-old weaned on Call of Duty have been cut out of the script and nothing is left but one recycled action scene after another , some of them already parodied in " Airplane " , backed up by a booming score . Here's an indication of how the movie was assembled , the kind of thought that went into it . When it was released there appeared an article in the NY Times written by an actor ( whose name I now forget ) playing one of the characters ( whose name I don't know ) in innocent conversation with Harrison Ford as the President , when shots are heard from elsewhere in Air Force One as the takeover starts . As the actor described the first run-through , at the sound of the gunshots , he rose to his feet and sauntered over to the window to find out what was up . He was told he'd have to jump to his feet and run to the door . " Why ? " he asked . " The Secret Service is aboard , there are security agents all over . Nobody could possibly be expecting an armed attack . A normal reaction would be to try to find out what the noise was . " He was told by the director that everyone in the scene would immediately recognize the gunshots for exactly what they were . Ford , a seasoned veteran of such attacks , told the actor tiredly , " They're gunshots , period . " Why waste three or four flaccid seconds having the actor stroll to the door ? That kind of dedication and efficiency is in evidence throughout " Air Force One . " Bang , bang , whoosh , zap . The President , by the way , is practically superhuman . He speaks Russian albeit with a gloopi American accent . He cuts his bound wrists free and immediately disarms and kills two or three of his captors . I lost count . Well , okay , he was a CMH winner . But then how did he learn to fly a jumbo jet ? Never mind . A more interesting question is how did they pick the villains ? Kazakhistan rebels ? A rogue group of Russians ? This is rather retro stuff because absolutely nobody watching the movie knows or cares about Kazakhistan or its internal affairs . The simple fact is that viewers will see and hear the heavies speaking Russian and that will be enough for them . ( I forget when " Crimson Tide " was released , using the same ploy . It's the Russkies again alright , only a splinter group . ) The faces of American fighter pilots are illuminated by a comforting pale off-white light , while their opposite numbers are as green as algae . To top it off , the Russian Premier looks like Jonathan Winters coming down from battery acid while our President looks exactly like Harrison Ford . And if you STILL don't get the point , the Kazakhhomaniac rebels sing a rousing version of " Die Internazionale . " Nowadays , of course , nine years later , they'd all be speaking Arabic . The movie offers some fascinating tidbits in addition to its knuckle-whitening suspense . The set representing the interior of Air Force One , for instance . It's full of nooks and crannies and it seems about the size of the Dixie Hotel . Functional furniture , but comfortable and expensive . Soundproof , bulletproof , insulated against an atomic blast . A staff of well-trained servants who know when to leave the master alone to ponder weighty questions about the world's future . ( In all these respects it rather resembles my place . ) It also has a steam pipe , which the list of clichés calls for , just as in those factories or warehouses in which the final shootout takes place in other action movies . The steam pipe is shot up and people in pursuit of each other wisp their way through the mist . What is that steam pipe doing there ? Have we been mistaken all these years about how jet engines work ? Are modern airplanes really powered by the same plants that made the Stanley Steamer roll on its merry way ? What makes it finally so preposterous is the notion that this or any other country could organize itself with such alacrity and efficiency in the face of an unexpected emergency of these proportions . When the president finally contacts the situation room and asks who has taken over Air Force One , the reply is , " A group of Russian ultra-nationalists . " This is nothing more than cashing in on ancient hatreds for a buck . And we pay for that self satisfaction on the world stage , by damaging the image of America abroad . How about a Russian movie in which a group of murdering thugs tries to kidnap Vladimir Putin and they are called " American ultra-nationalists " ? How would we respond ?
442924	819382	460435	2.0	Spoiled rotten .	I don't know why they had to tap Henry James ' novel , " The Turn of the Screw " , to get this plot together . The writers could have knocked off a one - or two-sentence treatment : " Mad woman hires out as nanny and harasses her two young charges to death . " James ' story , and Jack Clayton's adaptation of it in 1963 , are full of ambiguity . This version isn't . Leelee Sobieski is okay , as are the other performers . Sobieksi has the advantage of not being a star in the Hollywood sense , but an actress instead . Her figure is a little shapeless and her eyes , with all that black liner , too close together , and in this wintry English setting , her pallor against the snow gives her face the appearance of a charcoal sketch . She's the kind of woman a discerning man might find himself staring idly at , while standing next to her in the supermarket checkout line , and slowly realizing - - " Gee , she ain't too homely . " Her beauty is insinuating , and she's quite good in the role . The problem isn't with her , it's with the script . Tara Fitzgerald as Mrs . Grose has a tough job - - projecting sensuality undercut by a touch of the sinister . The two kids are alright , but they are , after all , kids . But never mind all that . The screenplay and direction bungle the task . Where to begin . The direction has a lot of arty touches , none of them original . Three figures in black silhouette skip along the top of a snowbank against a washed-out winter sky . Lots of cross-cutting during critical scenes . Intrusive flashbacks to Sobieski's youth , incomprehensible much of the time . ( Okay , she's suddenly a little girl oscillating on a park swing and she looks back over her shoulder and smiles at the camera and - - wham - - we're back in the present . ) These arty effects - - done with accomplished camera work , though - - deteriorate quickly into every cliché from the horror movie script guide . Guttural , animal sounds in the middle of the night , coming from nowhere . An intense electrical storm in the midst of winter , straight out of a B horror movie . Shock cuts accompanied by stings on the sound track . Before the movie is half over , Sobieski is already creeping around holding a butcher knife . Child abuse is hinted at . Lesbianism is shown . Graphic but brief nudity . ( Too brief . A little gratuitous sex might have helped . ) The monster's POV shots , where there be no monster . My attitude may be warped because Clayton's " The Innocents " was superb . It stuck pretty close to Henry James . James ' Mrs . Grose was not the dominatrix she is here ; she was an unimaginative old housekeeper . There is absolutely nothing in this version to compare with the scene in the garden in Clayton's movie , in which Deborah Kerr and the child watch a repugnant black beetle crawl out of the mouth of a marble cherub . Out of the mouths of babes ! But not here . If Deborah Kerr as the governess may have been slightly delusional , perhaps prompted by her attraction to her dismissive employer , Leelee Sobieski is frankly loco . In the earlier movie Kerr first merely senses the two ghosts - - Quint and Miss Jessel - - and then glimpses them from afar . The closest Kerr comes is when she enters an elongated empty classroom and thinks she sees Miss Jessel weeping over the desk at the other end . Miss Jessel disappears as Kerr approaches , but Kerr finds a fresh teardrop on the desk . The " evil " that the ghosts represent is never made clear . Here , it's the sexual abuse of children . Ho hum . I don't know why they bother to remake films that were so good in their original form . I really don't . How about a remake of " Citizen Kane " with Tom Cruise ? No ? " Gone With the Wind " with Keanu Reeves and Brittany Spears ? I've got it - - " On the Waterfront " with Rob Lowe and Paris Hilton .
443365	819382	462338	2.0	Big Joke	The received wisdom is that if you lie , you must stick as closely to the truth as practical , in order to make the lie believable . That , basically , is what Clifford Irving did with his fabricated " autobiography " of Howard Hughes , the secretive and eccentric billionaire . The problem is that everyone is already familiar with that dictum . If a man spends an evening with another woman , he's not likely to tell his wife that he was busy giving a speech at the Junior Chamber of Commerce . The alternative to the received wisdom is The Big Lie , the lie so huge , so outrageous , that others believe it because no one but a madman would make it up . That's what Hitler accused the Jews of doing , and Goebbels the English . Or , in the anonymous words of the Wikipedia essayist : " The Big Lie is a propaganda technique . It was defined by Adolf Hitler in his 1925 autobiography Mein Kampf as a lie so " colossal " that no one would believe that someone " could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously " . If Irving and his co-conspirators built a near-replicant of Hughes ' real life , they surrounded it with fantasies so rich that nobody could possibly doubt them . Would a fraud claim that Hughes was about to land his helicopter atop a New York building for a meeting with McGraw-Hill - - on the condition that the top two floors of the building be cleared , the floors scrubbed and waxed , and black non-dust-collecting material be draped across all the windows ? It must be common knowledge by now that Irving did a great deal of research on Howard Hughes - - right down to imitating his voice on tape in order to get Hughes ' grammatical errors and idiosyncratic expressions just right - - and tried to sell the result to McGraw-Hill for five million dollars or more . The hoax was exposed when a reluctant Hughes finally agreed to a public conference call in which he denied the whole business . Irving spent some time in the slams but nobody was very badly hurt . The movie is based on Clifford Irving's book , " The Hoax . " In other words , a quarter of a century later , Irving is still making money off his little adventure . Following Irving , the movie tells us that it all started off as a prank , a big joke that gradually got bigger . Poor Irving . He became a neural shambles trying to keep the enterprise together , what with betrayals by friends , threats from outside sources , traps set for him by Hughes and the President of the United States himself , the increased stress on his marriage . According to this fable , the wretched Irving is almost driven mad by his responsibility - - to others , that is . He never thinks of himself . He worries about his family . He worries about his friend's marriage . He receives a mysterious package full of secret data about Hughes , including a damning connection between Hughes and Nixon that could bring down Nixon's administration . Thereafter , Irving devotes himself to what he now sees as the pursuit of truth and justice . That is , he owes it to the American public that his fraudulent book be published because it may contain nuggets of truth . Does anyone believe this unspeakable crap anymore ? Irving was a smooth-talking , ambitious con man and self promoter who had a toothsome blond girl friend , who soaked up the publicity during appearances on TV talk shows , and who eagerly anticipated the millions of dollars that were to be bilked from a respectable publisher , a rich but private citizen , and the millions of ordinary readers who would have bought his fake book . He was undeterred by his exposure as a fraud . In later interviews he would immediately switch the topic of conversation to the tribulations that he and his family had been put through , especially his poor little kiddies with tears in their eyes while daddy was in jail . And he's STILL at it with his book now having been made into a movie starring Richard Gere . The screenplay treats the story with the shabbiness it deserves . Hand-held cameras wobble during scenes of activity . Impossible fantasies of Irving being kidnapped at night , beaten senseless , and thrown out of hotel windows by agents of Howard Hughes prompt our sympathy . ( It never happened , and the movie tries to explain it as a drunken fantasy so convincing that Irving believed it had happened . I ask you , the honest reader , the experienced drunk - - when is the last time you were so bombed that you woke up the next morning thinking you'd really been spirited away to Nassau , beaten by Howard Hughes , thrown into a pool , then flown back home ? ) Actually , one of Hughes ' agents shows up from time to time as a hallucinated figure with which Irving has extensive and informative exchanges . The hallucination isn't entirely without sympathy for Irving , but generally practical and suitably distant . I got a little tired of these realistic hallucinations during " A Brilliant Mind . " I didn't mind them too much when Willie Loman talked with them because , back in the late 1940s , they had a touch of originality . Here , they're just cheap expository tricks . The whole movie is like that - - cheap and self serving . The Big Joke conflated with The Big Lie . It stinks .
443094	819382	106527	2.0	Narcissists	A depressing tale of a middle-aged man and teen-aged girl who have an affair , presumably , after which the girl shoots the guy's wife in the head , so that the girl and the guy can get married , or at least live together , happily ever after . It's based on the real events surrounding Aimee Fisher and Joey Buttafuco . She's played my Alyssa Milano , in probably her most demanding role , and the car mechanic is Jack Scalia . What a tawdry tale . A narcissistic pedophile and a spoiled pretty nymphomaniac . Lots of sex , intrigue , conflict , some violence , all rather disgusting , which is probably why three independent TV made-for movies about the case hit the TV screens at the same time . This one is definitely from Butaffuco's point of view . The poor guy loves his wife and children ( sob ) and never touches this succulent nymphet . Fisher is plumply overdeveloped , more than simply enticing , bursting her seams , and she's the aggressor and the liar in the tale . Buttafuco is the innocent victim . Right . No ex coke addicted , pumped up , self-admiring Italian philanderer would dream of laying a paw on this fawning young creature . Man , is he put upon . Our eyes water at the narrative . Aimee lies to her family and tells them that Joey gave her herpes . Then tries to murder his wife . And all this time he's nothing more than a cheerful , loving , family man and upright citizen , aghast at all the terrible things he's accused of . Did he fund this movie ? The other two made-fors took quite different points of view , depending on who was backing the production and which particular participant in this disgusting tale was doing the endoresements . Utterly revolting garbage , which the public ate up . Alyssa Milano is a beautiful young woman . Anyone who wants to see her en deshabille should rent " Kiss of the Vampire " or whatever it was , far sexier , and less repugnant simply because it is more mindless . This movie actually has a point of view . It could have skipped the sleazy plot and just shown us Joey pumping iron in a gym and Aimee coupling in some stranger's back seat . An insult to the public viewer , who gobbled it down with relish .
443450	819382	47559	2.0	Magnificently lousy .	Four people ( Denning , Crowley , Grey , and Reeves ) meet by accident on the streets of a city that has been emptied overnight of people , except for a few dead bodies . They learn from a newspaper that the city has been invaded and evacuated by everyone else . The cars have been disabled , so the four refugees hole up in the suite of a hotel , making do with candles , beer , and canned food . There WAS a fifth member of the group , a witless little character , but he ran out into the street and was rayed to death by a wandering robot . The invading army , as it turns out , consists entirely of these robots with their death rays . They're impervious to bullets and can destroy airplanes , presumably with the same rays . A gun-toting evil murderer invades the hotel sanctuary of the survivors and puts moves on Crowley ( who has fallen in love with Denning after knowing him for only a few hours ) . The resulting fight sees Grey killed and Denning wounded before the burly Reeves manages to strangle the killer . The scenes of the survivors are inter cut with scenes of the requisite military and scientists trying just as hard as they can to devise a means of disabling these robots . They finally succeed - - surprise ! When the robot army is exposed to sound waves of a certain frequency , it " cracks their cathode ray tubes . " ( Your television set is a cathode ray tube . ) The army comes to the rescue at the last moment , too late , alas , to save Reeves but soon enough to whisk off Denning and Crowley . A cheap and boring movie , I found it almost impossible to watch . Well , sometimes the cheapness can't be helped . A budget will stretch only so far , as we all must know . But this thing could have been written and acted by members of the robot army , who look like they're made of Lego's or like unusually angular Gorts , although we only see one of them at a time . The dialog sucks . The plot is unoriginal . The special effects might better have been suggested than put on display . The logic of the plot is terribly flawed and the direction careless . ( Carefully pruned , it might have been a decent episode of The Outer Limits . ) I'll give just one example of a jarring lapse of common sense . The vicious murderer is holding the others at gunpoint and Grey suddenly remembers where she saw him before . He's the guy that murdered that hooker on Skid Row ! That's right , admits the evildoer . His picture was all over the papers . They'll be looking for him on every street corner , Denning observes . Not if I slip out through the sewers and get out behind the enemy lines , the murderer sneers . The entire city has been evacuated and is now occupied by indestructible robots who kill people and repulse the military with unknown rays - - yet they'll be watching every street corner for some nobody who killed a hooker ! Santa Clause could waltz past the army without interference under these conditions ! Well , another example . At the very beginning , Crowley wakes up to find the city empty and she wanders the streets . She stumbles across a dead body and Richard Denning at roughly the same time . They introduce themselves and explain where they spent the previous night . Minutes of frippery go by while neither asks the question : WHAT HAPPENED ? It could have been good , even with the inexpensive sets and the second-tier ( but seasoned ) actors . As it is , it's rather a painful experience except for those who really enjoy cheesy SF movies , and there seem to be legions of those . The producer , the late Herbert Cohen , provides an audio commentary on the DVD and he seems like a good-natured guy . He's generous with his credits and he didn't mind if people laughed at the crummy effects when the picture was released and he still doesn't mind .
443555	819382	62673	3.0	Diluted and boring film a clef .	It's a not-entirely fictional story about the Ango-American landings at Anzio on Italy's west coast . It's diluted because the story behind those landings is far more interesting than what we see on the screen . Names , personalities , and motives are changed around so that hardly any echo of the real characters remains , although we get a lot of information about characters created in the screenplay . Basically , Robert Ryan plays General Mark Clark who was in charge of the operation and was in overall command of the Fifth Army . He was an interesting guy for a general - - tall , vain , brave , half-Jewish , a large-featured face like the mask of Tragedy , carrying around a sidearm as a prop . Arthur Kennedy plays General John P . Lewis ( modeled after Gen . Lucas ) , in charge of the landings themselves . Mitchum accuses him of being " timid " ( three times ) and in a way he was , although it wasn't entirely his fault . Arthur Franz has a small role as General Lucian K . Truscott , the junior general in command of the Third Division ( Audie Murphy's division ) . All the names have been changed to protect the guilty . Here , basically , is how it worked . The Allies of half a dozen nationalities were being slaughtered throwing themselves against the German Gustav line , which ran across the Italian boot from sea to sea , commanded by the unconquerable Monte Cassino . The Anzio landings were designed to catch the enemy by surprise from behind and relieve pressure at the Gustav line . Mark Clark ( who saw to it that any reference to the Fifth Army in the press appeared as a reference to " Mark Clark's Fifth Army " ) had supervised similar earlier landings at Salerno . They were successful , but just barely . The landings at Anzio were handed over to Lucas , whose orders included a drive inland , if possible , to the Alban Hills which commanded a perfect view of the beachhead and the main highway to Rome . Lucas had just troops enough to dig in and consolidate or to race pell mell to the Alban Hills , but not enough troops to do both . Lucas was advised by Clark , " Don't stick your neck out like I did at Salerno . " ( The line is directly quoted in the movie , but is given to Robert Ryan's fictional general . ) So Lucas didn't stick his neck out . He went inland seven miles , stopped short of the Alban Hills , and dug in . Clark , who was on the beach , agreed with the decision . And Lucas wasn't the cocksure but mistaken strategist played by Arthur Kennedy . The real General Lucas kept a diary and it's full of gloomy forebodings . The Germans , under Kesselring and Mackensen , were caught unprepared . Nothing stood between the allies and the Alban Hills , or Rome for that matter . But Lucas did nothing , and for good reasons . He didn't have the resources to take Rome and hold it . Except for the probe by Rangers , as shown on screen , and others by British troops , everyone dug in and waited for the German reinforcements to deploy , which happened apace . Kesselring was a very efficient tactician and had plenty of time to ring in troops in the stalled Allied beach head . Instead of Anzio rescuing the troops at the Gustav line , the situation was turned around . In the end , some 24 , 000 American and 9 , 000 British casualties were evacuated from the beachhead . Clark fired Lucas and gave command to Truscott . When the German resistance finally collapsed , General Clark had an opportunity to drive eastward across the Italian boot and cut off the German troops to the south . He chose instead to forget about capturing the German army and to zip his own troops north along the highway to Rome so that he could " conquer " the open city . You know - - like Julius Caesar ? The German army promptly withdrew north to their next massive defense line , where the Allied advance stalled again . I leave it to the viewer to decide which story is more engaging , the historical one or the plot we see on the screen , which is mostly the story of seven survivors of the Ranger patrol who try to make their way back to Anzio , a story we've seen many times before . I wish I could at least say that the story presented on screen is well done but the fact is that it's not . This is one of Mitchum's lazier performances . Sometimes he sounds positively drunk . No one else stands out , including Peter Falk , who overplays , as does Arther Kennedy as the smarmy General Whatever-his-name-is . And some other posters are absolutely right about the score . Whew ! A simple-minded would-be catchy love song doesn't turn into a martial theme just because you throw some snare drums behind it and play it as a march . What a missed opportunity .
442076	819382	102789	3.0	The very definition of Routine Thriller .	Denzel Washington is a prosperous , respected , happily married DA . John Lithgow is a prisoner whom Washington sent up the river years ago . Lithgow and a friend escape , murdering everyone in their path . Lithgow fakes his own death . Everyone now believes him to be a harmless corpse , but ha ha , he moves around lithely in his ghostly world ( where does he get his money ? ) and devotes himself to making Washington's life miserable . Not KILLING Washington , but ruining his life forever , a la Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck in " Cape Fear , " only worse . His frame-up of Washington is really devilishly skillful . He conks the unsuspecting DA on the head , take him to an empty swimming pool at an empty club , drugs him into near insensibility , and videotapes him having sex with some bimbo who , as it later turns out , is also giving him the clap . Washington finally wakes up to find himself in rags amongst a community of homeless people . WELL ! Nobody believes his story of course . They keep telling him things like , " Denzel - - John Lithgow is dead . " Blood work reveals both cocaine and heroin in his system of course . The investigating authorities also find a collection of planted kiddie porn in his possession . And the video tape of his sitting on a bed while some white gal does a cowboy on him turns up in the hands of the authorities too , with dialog altered so that Washington , instead of being half dead from drugs , appears to be saying , " You're going to do exactly what I tell you , " and the babe answers , " Anything you say , dumpling , " or something like that . The tape turns his wife off . The dose of clap doesn't help either . You see , the problem is that no one believes him - - not his bosses , not his family , nobody except his closest friend at the office , a short and pasty white guy who incarnates the concept of " impotence . " Speaking of that , how did that hooker manage to give the sleeping drugged-out Washington a dose ? Well , never mind . When Washington takes the legal authorities to the club with the empty swimming pool , he finds himself in one of those scenes where things have been changed around so that they seem perfectly normal . His colleagues make snotty remarks . The scene might have been lifted from a dozen other movies , maybe most famously " North by Northwest . " Lithgow shoots the best friend and throws the pistol to Washington , who catches it in his bare hands so his fingerprints are all over it . All of this shows up in the most sensationalized fashion in the press . After the murder of his friend , Washington is suspended , though here , as elsewhere , the plot has a bit of a hole in it since nobody could possibly come up with a motive for Washington's killing the only friend he has . Washington , harassed and hated by the law , driven half nuts by Lithgow , turns to the homies in the neighborhood where he grew up . They take care of his family and help him lure Lithgow to the Watts Towers where the dramatic finale takes place with the expectable dramatic results . Here's another example of a stupid plot device . Just before the confrontation at the Towers , Washington has drawn all the media and the cops to a block where he is standing on the roof , doing nutty things like putting on makeup for the cameras , and threatening to blow himself up . All this appears on live TV and Lithgow , aghast at the prospect of losing the mouse he's been toying with , shows up at the scene . Someone taps him on the shoulder and tells him , " Mister Blake ? Phone call for you . " Lithgow seems puzzled at being recognized but goes to the phone anyway , where an anonymous caller tells him to go to the Watts Towers , without giving him any reason to do so . Lithgow , who has shown all sorts of brains until now , does exactly as he's asked . The holes ? Lithgow would never have shown up at the scene in the first place . How could he possibly stop Washington from jumping off a fourteen-story building ? Why would he risk revealing his existence in front of a horde of police and frenetic media ? Two - - instead of answering the phone , anyone with brains would deny being the dead Mr . Blake and walk away . Three - - follow directions and go to the Watts Towers ? Why ? There is plenty of action for action fans . Cars do stunts . People get electrocuted and shot . Buildings explode . People live in a Biblical world of pure good and pure evil . If that's what you're looking for you'll find it here . Washington should never have put himself into this movie though . He's a decent actor but absolutely NOBODY could bring off the several scenes in which he tries to explain the nature of the frame and instead sounds like a raving lunatic , stuttering out gibberish worthy of a schizophrenic's word salad . It's already been done to death . ( Watch Jack Lemon try to explain why he's holding the nuclear power plant at gunpoint , while SWAT is banging on the locked door in " The China Syndrome " . ) There's another element that some might find unsettling too . In the end , you can only trust your own people . There are four classes of white people .

442808	819382	144214	3.0	Disappointing Military Whodunnit .	All the ingredients seem to be there but the dish comes out flat . Nice cast , and they all do a journeyman job , but most of them are in minor roles and some of them contribute virtually nothing to the goings on . Madeleine Stowe for instance is radiant , as usual , with those crossed coal-black irises , but why is she here ? I don't object to her presence . How could anyone ? With that iliac garland and that modest bosom ? I just question her presence . And there is a mean-looking redneck Southern sheriff whose only reason for being there seems to be providing a target for Travolta's unnecessary remark that he should be out clubbing the colored folks somewhere . The photography is first-rate too . Savannah has never looked quite so - - Southern . And that's about it . The story is so intricate that it's hard to follow . The script makes everyone except Travolta and Stowe into a suspect . People lurk in shadows . They peer intensely at a pair of general's stars ( which have nothing to do with the movie ) while ominous music slowly builds . Some speak elliptically , hinting at horrors , and it leads nowhere . Red herrings all over the place . The moment one is identified as some sort of villain , he's revealed as innocent and someone else comes under the magnifying glass , until he too is discarded , and we wind up with the one guy who has never been shown to be involved in any way in the crimes and who has been nothing but a cooperative friend to the two investigators . And even this revelation ( involving a slow-motion explosion - - what else ? ) is anti-climactic because we have yet to get to the REAL villain ! What the hell is the movie supposed to be about anyway ? Is it an exercise in surrealism ? It begins with Travolta asleep in his bed . An assassin creeps into his houseboat and shoots the place into little pieces before Travolta jumps him and they fall in the water and somebody starts an outboard motor in the middle of an underwater fight and the spinning screw fortuitously Cuisinearts somebody's face up and the water turns red and no satisfactory explanation for the fight to the death follows . Or - - let me put it this way . If you were a woman who was gang raped and beaten and your father visited you in the hospital , kissed your forehead , assured you of his love , and advised you to never think of the incident again , would you be willing to destroy your life in order to destroy his ? Not to argue that the father - - in this case James Cromwell - - is morally right in taking his career into account . That's pretty selfish and his lack of righteous anger at his daughter's rapists is a big hole in his character . But his daughter , an Army captain of delicious aspect , tries to get her revenge by sleeping with every guy on the base in order to make him seem a fool . She succeeds and he finally tells her she must see a therapist or resign her commission . Now - - get this - - and this is seven years after the original brutal rape , which is implausibly presented to begin with - - she enlists the help of her friend and mentor ( James Woods ) who ties her spreadeagled and naked on the ground . And she arranges to have her father drive out to see her in this position , alone at night , and screams at him , something like , " Do you see what they did to me ? Do you feel guilty NOW ? " She tells him that she is going to remain in this position until everyone on the base knows about it and her father's career is torpedoed . Well - - the best advice she ever got came from him . ( 1 ) Try not to think about the original rape . And ( 2 ) get help . There is no help in the direction either . Lots of closeups of faces with tears or agonized expressions . ( Except for Clarence Williams , who can produce tears but no expressions at all . ) I suppose , in the end , we are supposed to find ourselves brimming over with the self-righteous anger that Cromwell's general lacks . A woman in the Army has been foully mistreated and we are enraged . The problem is a real one . There seem to be more sexual assaults on women in the military than is usually assumed , although it's doubtful that many of them are officers . As a social problem , it deserves a more thoughtful and skillful treatment than you can find in this movie .
443225	819382	37121	4.0	Harmless Flag-Waver About Boot Camp .	A routine program filler with some familiar faces in the cast - - Rosco Karns , Robert Armstrong of " King Kong , " Horace McMahon in a walk-on . It's sort of a training film - - " What to Expect When You Join the Navy and What You Should Avoid Doing . " The opening narration tells us about the men in civilian clothes who are being marched into the Great Lakes Naval Training Center , " Yesterday , you lived in Glencoe , Illinois , in Hammond , Indiana , in Podunk , Nebraska . And you were a machinist , a clerk , a farmer , a philatelist ( well , not that ) , but today you're joining the Navy and you are sailors . " That's fine for the half dozen men whose careers we follow , but a little upsetting to Johnny Zumano , a boxer whose career was just getting started and who wanted to become a champ to provide for his impoverished parents . Johnny , whose story this chiefly is , gets over his initial frustration but when , on top of everything else , he is dumped by his girl friend he gets drunk and is about to be court martialed and discharged . Through the seasonable interposition of a gracious providence , the four-striper who is about to pull the lanyard on the guillotine of justice overhears Johnny talking to the chaplain . " Gee , I wanted to stay in the Navy something awful and ship out with the other fellas but I couldn't tell the Captain that . " Johnny has his pride , see , and he don't go whining to nobody . However , the Captain having overheard Johnny's confession , so to speak , now realizes how committed Johnny is to the U . S . Navy . Does Johnny avoid a discharge ? Does he join his comrades ? Do they ship out together ? No power on earth could drag the answers from me . It's a low-budget effort , true , and we can't expect too much in the way of acting or story or art direction . Yet , every time I tell myself that , I think of Val Lewton over at RKO who in the same time period was churning out one little gem after another on a similar budget , and horror pictures at that , with such unpromising titles as " The Leopard Man . " Or , ten years later , the inexpensive but vernacular art of the Scott-Boettiger Westerns . It's the difference between merely doing a job and showing some degree of craftsmanlike care in your product .
443152	819382	41253	4.0	Second-Hand Stuff .	Raoul Walsh does his usual yeoman-like job of directing this mediocre Western with Joel McRae as an outlaw trying to make one last big haul by robbing a train , Dorothy Malone as the young woman he thinks he loves , and Virginia Mayo as the girl who is , as he finally realizes , made for him . Walsh also directed the original story , " High Sierra " , with Humphrey Bogart , Joan Leslie , and Ida Lupino in the same roles . " Colorado Territory " absconds with the story but leaves John Huston's felicitous script behind as scraps . Walsh has never directed a dull film , and this isn't dull . What it is , is simple minded . All of the subtlety and ambiguity that made the original so fine , so artful , is discarded and instead the characters and their motives are simplified to the extent that any particularly aware third-grader can grasp them . What I mean is - - how should I put this ? Maybe I can make the point by giving an example . In " High Sierra " , Bogart meets a simple , kind old man with a crippled grand-daughter who needs an operation . That's the teen-aged Joan Leslie we're talking about , and , man , she looks good , though rendered sullen by her disability . Bogart comes into some loot and gives much of it to Joan Leslie's family so that she can have her operation . Meanwhile , he falls in with Ida Lupino , a whore who has been kicked around , loves Bogart , and will do anything for him . Before adopting Lupino , Bogart tells her that there's no place in his life for her . ( He's thinking of settling down with Joan Leslie once she's fixed up . ) Leslie's operation is a success and from her recovery bed she showers Bogart with gratitude - - but not love , as she explains to Grampa . On his next visit , Bogart finds her drinking and jitterbugging frenetically with a boyfriend . Leslie is still grateful to Bogart but she rejects his possessiveness , and he leaves her forever with Ida Lupino . Huston and Walsh fill these scenes with love , ambiguity , a frantic hope and a hopeless remorse . In the remake , the Joan Leslie figure , Dorothy Malone , has nothing wrong with her except that she is greedy and treacherous . Although McRae gives the family enough money to start their farm , Malone tries to alert the sheriff to MacRae's presence in order to collect the twenty-thousand-dollar reward . The Ida Lupino character , Virginia Mayo , actually has to have a physical fight with Malone to keep her from rushing out the door . There is no ambiguity , no sense of real life . Malone is not a nice , if slightly empty-headed girl , who wants to just enjoy her new freedom . She's a bad girl . " Colorado Territory " is miscast , as well . Joel McRae is a good light comedian or light action star - - a nice guy . He's not the tough ex-con that Bogart was . And Virginia Mayo is supposed to be part Pueblo Indian , though she looks about as Indian as Jean Harlow , the heavy makeup notwithstanding . One of the most touching ( because grounded ) elements of the original is that Bogart had to give up the vivacious young Joan Leslie for the older , husky , used , and rather plain Ida Lupino . In the remake , the succulent Virginia Mayo of 1949 could give Dorothy Malone a run for her money any day . It's like a high-schooler having to give up his romance with the head of the girl's cheer-leading squad for the love of the Prom Queen . There's not much of a sense of loss . I've picked out just one set of relationships to compare , but any viewer could easily spot a dozen more in which the original is superior to the remake . ( Humphrey Bogart , describing what a Tommy gun sounds like , taps his finger three times on the desk and says , " Tap tap tap . That's all . " Nothing like that here . ) Nice location shooting , but if you want to see a movie made for adult sensibilities , rent the original . This remake is pretty watered down .
442294	819382	115857	4.0	The very definition of routine .	The frozen landscapes are impressive . Ice-covered lakes , stark bare tree trunks that look black against the snow . It gets so cold that at night you hear trees crack when their sap freezes . In upstate New York , I used to stare out the windows during dull lectures and wonder how the Iroquois could have survived winters in such a climate . Here , unfortunately , we have to look at interiors in Chicago and Washington , DC , and even in the exterior scenes the actors have a habit of getting in the way of the scenery . What happens , very briefly , is that a handful of naive young scientists , including Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz , are involved in an experiment which they hope will supply the world with energy that costs almost nothing . They don't know it but they're working on a secret CIA project . The company intends to suppress the results of the experiment because they don't want a world-wide panic when oil becomes nothing more than a paleontological curiosity . It's cheap energy that is the MacGuffin here , but it could be anything else - - a Fountain of Youth serum , the top-secret formula for Coca Cola , a single pill that keeps you high the rest of your life , a draught that turns you into a Priapistic monster in the blink of an eye , the missing National Guard records of an important personage , the tax returns of another - - anything you like . The whole thing is exciting and full of propulsion and is written and directed strictly by the numbers . It could have come out of Screen writing for Dummies . There is intrigue and suspense in the story , but only enough of a plot to link the violent episodes together , or the chase scenes , just as there's enough plot in a pornographic movie to bring the performers physically together . The casting and direction are able to clear the same , very low bar . The evildoers look ugly . The well-meaning but confused FBI guys look well-meaning but confused . The two innocent leads are beautiful . Not a single opportunity is wasted in pumping up the adrenalin of the viewers . If a hero is being chased across the Michigan Avenue drawbridge and it begins to open , he must reach the very end of the tilted structure and dangle from it . If he and the heroine run through a tunnel while being pursued , he must hold her hand and pull her along behind him . They can out-race exploding fireballs . Why go on ? It's an effective chase thriller if that's what you're looking for . And Morgan Freeman gives an outstanding performance , saddled as he is with lines like , " The world isn't all that simple , Eddie . " What's most bothersome is that the problem that should be at the heart of this heartless movie is almost entirely dispensed with . Homo sapiens ' place in the ecosystem in which he plays such an important part is hardly dealt with - - not even in passing . Our place in nature seems to be too important to be used as a Hollywood gimmick , a device to hang an uninspired plot from . I don't mean the movie has to be full of gravitas . But even comedies have done a better job of dealing with the kinds of questions this film raises . See " The Man in the White Suit " for an example .
443571	819382	109198	4.0	You have already seen it .	Madeleine Stowe , as Cody Zamora , is a hooker who shoots a man in self defense . Being what she is , that is to say , not being Mother Teresa , she doesn't generate much sympathy in this rough-riding town and the good citizens decide to hang her . " Get on with it , " she tells them with defiant contempt . They're about to do just that when three other young women of dubious repute rescue her at the last minute and ride off . In pursuit are a variety of justice seekers , including Pinkertons and other law types , one or two of them , such as Dermot Mulroney and James LeGros aren't too bad . On the trail they run into the Jarrett Gang . Some of the bad girls , and some of the pursuers as well , carry baggage with them related to the Jarrett Gang . There is a violent shoot out . Now , we must note here that the writers weren't reaching too far for original character names . The leader of the girls is Cody Zamora , whereas the leader of the Gang is Kid Jarrett . I'd be surprised if the writers hadn't seen James Cagney in " White Heat " as a gang leader named Cody Jarrett . At least there were no Wades or Coles or Lukes or Matts , although there was a bad guy named Yuma , which is pretty bad . In fact , though , all four of the bad girls could as easily have been men , or more easily . They WOULD have been men back in the 1950s or 1960s . But then I suppose the Jarrett Gang wouldn't have had an opportunity to treat Drew Barrymore to a lesson in Tough Love . At that , though , this is a BIG improvement over " Westward the Women , " with Robert Taylor as a sadistic wagonmaster hired to cart a caravan of would-be wives out to a female-starved Western outpost . Taylor consistently treats his wards like dirt and actually whips some of them when they don't work hard enough . There's nothing original here except the gender of the four leads . There is some suggested nudity but no simulated sex or anything else to pique one's interest . They just seem to have rounded up four popular actresses and thrown them into a well-worn dusty rut . The climactic gunplay is lifted straight out of " The Wild Bunch " , as are a couple of slow-motion gunshots . No reason for it , except that it had been done before . I thank the whole tenor of the pitcher is captured when there is a scene of them four hoorah gals a-settin ' around the camp fire and a-havin ' a peaceful chat . All four of them is exquisitely dressed and unimpeachably groomed with modern hair styles and make up in full panoply . Not a hair out of place , y'know ? But the make up department has very carefully brushed a comely taupe area on one cheek or a smear of raw sienna across some otherwise impeccable forehead . That's dust and dirt from the road . They been on the trail fer quite a spell . And they talk like they just graduated from Wellesley . ( That's this here classy college back East , kids . ) Not a single " g " is dropped at the end of a word like " nothing , " or - - as we rawboned cowboys like to call it - - " NUTHIN . " How can writers and directors be so careless , so contemptuous of viewers ? Or maybe I'm mistaken . Maybe they have a different audience in mind . But if so , what is it ?
442066	819382	100114	4.0	Macho Man	Have you ever wondered why these guys - - Seagal , Stallone , Willis , et al - - manage to survive all those gunfights in which they're outnumbered ? I think I've got it figured out . The enemies always miss , and the hero doesn't . Here , Seagal has a pistol and outshoots a half dozen heavies firing at him from a few feet away . One of the heavies has a shotgun . Or maybe two of them have . It doesn't really matter . There could be a thousand shotguns blasting away at him and Seagal would still emerge with his ponytail intact . And when it comes to mano a mano combat - - forget it . The evildoers may or may not be armed with swords or knives or blunt object but Seagal , with his skill in aikido or tempura or sushido or play-do or whatever it is , brushes them aside with a few dismissive blows . Not only is he a master of these outré skills but his physical strength is Herculean . More than once he snaps somebody's long bones as easily as we would break a toothpick . One he breaks a guy's SPINE over his knee . I'll tell you something . ( I'm getting into the spirit of the film here because Seagal uses that line , " I'll tell you something , " several times , along with , " What's that supposed to mean ? " ) These guys are fully deserving of extinction in any good Xenophobe's handbook . They are all black , speak with unintelligible Jah-MAY-can accents , wear dreadlocks that look in dire need of a shampoo , they torture and murder with aplomb , and - - here's the worst part . They're unchristian . That's right . They practice voodoo . Actually the voodoo element comes close to being the most interesting element of the film . They got the constituents of the ritual pretty well - - cigar smoke , rum spitting , the sacrificial chicken . They only left out the possession dance in which the spirit rides the dancer . They should have read Metraux on voodoo . Otherwise the plot adheres to the usual conventions . What was done to Jaqueline Bissett by the voodoo-practitioners in " The Deep " is done here to a friend of Seagal's . What was done to John Wayne when he was stuck between trucks in " McQ " is done here to Seagal himself . At the movie's very opening , when Seagal makes a brief speech about having seen too much pointless violence in his DEA career so he's now happily retired , and when we are introduced to his friends and family , I tried to keep track of his affiliates to see if I could pick out which ones would be horribly murdered or maimed to generate his quest for revenge . The acting doesn't really require much comment . But Charles , the Jamaican cop , played by Tom Wright , is really pretty good . Wright has considerable range . Here , he's an associate of dubious allegiance , rather sinister . But in " The Pentagon Wars " he has a comic part that he underplays perfectly . The Jamaicans never flew as movie villains . I don't know why exactly . It's a small movie market . And if you go to Jamaica stick to Montego Bay . However , if you want to see Jamaican voodoo drug dealers as heavies , and if you're in the mood for another typical-standard action flick , this should be a satisfying view .
443338	819382	74899	4.0	Awful	There's no need to go on about this prototypical piece of chauvinistic rubbish except to say that it's an insult to the brave people involved in the battle . Every subtlety is deleted . Every American error glossed over . Obtrusive subplots detract from the essential story . The editing is a mish mash of model work , actual overused combat footage , and excepts from a previous movie , and is confusing to the point of , well , confusion . The role of sheer luck is downplayed . The Japanese fully expected the American carriers to sally forth for a big Mahanian confrontation , which they did , and sent scouting submarines towards Pearl Harbor . But by the time the subs reached their assigned positions , it was too late . Our carriers had already passed to the west . The sole reason we were able to pull this off was our decryption of Japanese plans , which enabled our forces to move far more quickly than could reasonably be expected . At Coral Sea our forces were so little experienced that Douglas SBDs ( with one foreward-firing fixed gun ) were sent one on one against agile Japanese zeros . After the Battle of Midway the Japanese carriers , their airplanes , and most of their pilots were gone , of course , but there was still an enormous striking force afloat . This force slowly turned away after the battle , tempting the remaining American forces to follow and initiate another clash . Had we struck at the lure , the best guess is we would have been clobbered , if only because American forces were so outmatched . And there is an excellent likelihood we would have lost the island of Midway . Spruance wisely chose to withdraw his forces rather than leap aggressively at the bait . Had Halsey been in charge , had he not been hospitalized with a skin disorder , it is difficult to imagine his turning down such a tempting offer , but luck was with our side again , and Spruance , having achieved victory , departed the field , while Halsey itched . The movie is a piece of junk .
442723	819382	51706	4.0	Routine period mystery / thriller .	" The Haunted Strangler " has been compared to " Dr . Jeykll and Mr . Hyde " and to the Val Lewton horror productions at RKO , and it's easy to see why . Boris Karloff is Rankin , a novelist with a devoted wife and loving step-daughter . Twenty years after the hanging of the notorious Strangler , Rankin develops a theory that the hanged man wasn't guilty at all , but that it was the pathologist in the case , Tennant , who half-strangled and butchered those five women . With the help of a psychiatric intern , and against the advice of his friend Burke ( Anthony Dawson ) , the police detective , Rankin investigates the case and finds evidence incriminating Tennant . Shortly after the Strangler's execution , Tennant was found to be suffering from fits of paralysis and violent outbursts , followed by amnesia for the events . Tennant was ensconced in a mental hospital but escaped with the help of a nurse who had fallen in love with him . About half-way through the film we learn that Rankin himself was Tennant , and his now loving wife was the nurse who helped him . But by this time Rankin has begun to suffer again the murderous paralytic rages and the amnesia that follows . It gets kind of confused somewhere around here . Rankin's recent spells seem to be triggered by the scalpel that was missing from Tennant's collection of surgical instruments . When he grasps the scalpel , Rankin turns into a twisted wreck and he murders without reason . Poor Karloff's face wears a prosthetic or two that twists it all out of symmetry and gives him a look that is at once demonic and full of pain , as if he were suffering the grandfather of all abscessed teeth . On top of that his hair gets messed up . If he first set out to find Tennant guilty , he now must run around trying to convince others that he himself is Tennant . Well , Jeykll and Hyde , yes . Tennant / Rankin is an upright man , no question about it , and his paralytic self is a raving , murderous animal who leaps about to a dissonant , tinkling score . The ego and the id . But Val Lewton , no . Everything in this film is overdone . The acting is in-your-face and not always convincing . The performance of the Newgate turnkey is positively painful . Rankin's butchery isn't as explicit as it would become in the slasher films but it is on-screen butchery . And there is an unnecessary scene of a prisoner being whipped at Newgate Prison . The whipper is a cliché - - a big , fat , bald , sweating sadist . The dialog is entirely functional , without the spark of any inspiration , and the period detail perfunctory . The direction is of the same quality , everything spelled out as if for an audience of children . The scenes in the madhouse are filled with the hoots and howls of the insane so that the hospital sounds more like a zoo . ( Alas , this was likely to be too often true before the chemical straight jackets of phenothiazines were discovered in the 1950s . That was the second revolution in mental health . The first was the unchaining of the maniacs at La Bicetre by the humanitarian Philippe Pinel . Before that , they weren't zoos but infernos . ) But then - - everybody seems to shout . They run , they shout , they wave their arms and disfigure their faces with emotions unless , like the intern , they are utter blanks . In the end , I felt sorry for Karloff . The actor , not the character . He was seventy or thereabouts when this was shot and , as good natured as William Henry Pratt was , he probably joked about the role . Still , thirty years beyond Frankenstein and he's playing another monster .
442653	819382	104265	4.0	Confusing story of murder , insanity , and assorted mishigas .	Kind of disappointing considering the cast - - Richard Gere as the morally upright but slightly imprudent psychiatrist , Uma Thurman as his " caterpillar " patient , and Kim Basinger as Thurman's seductive older sister . To help him understand Thurman's problems , Gere seeks out Basinger and winds up making furious love to her on their first date . She , lamentably , is married to one of those madly jealous Circum-Mediterranean gangsters who has muscles all over his body as well as inside his head . This is Eric Roberts in his perfect evil greaseball mode . He dominates Basinger and makes her do humiliating sexual things , which is perhaps his one good idea before she bashes his head in with one of his own dumb bells . It seems she suffers from " pathological intoxication . " One sip of alcohol and she becomes violently psychotic , and she had innocently sipped some alcohol-based cough medicine just before the homicide . Gere helps her shape her defense , brings in his friend , Paul Guilfoyle , to serve as her lawyer , and she gets off with a " not guilty by reason of temporary insanity . " Thereafter , it gets twisted . A little too twisted if you ask me . By the end I could hardly tell who was who or what was what . It's pretty thrilling all the way through . It's just that it doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense . Thurman's character begins in cahoots with her sister , then betrays her , then helps her escape from the funny farm , then takes over her identity and murderous quirks . Why ? It would take more than a shrink to determine that . It would require a mind reader , or maybe a seasoned screenwriter . It's nicely acted and the location photography is picturesque - - San Francisco at its most glorious , the Golden Gate Bridge is in every other shot . But it's cheap too . The director uses every cliché in the book regardless of whether they fit together . The climax at the top of a light house has the railing collapsing and Gere dangling over the crashing breakers - - in a howling electrical storm the likes of which Point Reyes has never seen . The fulsome orchestral score belongs to the genus Slasher . And , as I say , the plot is dizzying and at times makes no sense . Okay . Basinger is accused of murder , which she has in fact committed . The only question in whether a condition called " pathological intoxication " exists or not . The prosecution calls an expert witness , a haughty woman psychiatrist with a bony face and a foreign accent . She declares that the condition does not exist except in the minds of defense counsels . Why doesn't she believe there is any such thing ? Because there is no physical evidence . It doesn't show up in brain scans or blood tests . An experienced defense attorney would have jumped all over her and asked if there were any " physical evidence " that schizophrenia exists . There isn't , but nobody can deny that the condition is real . Anyway , in a sense , it's an exciting movie and soothing too , watching cliché follow cliché while common sense flies out the window . Kind of a ritualistic experience , like listening to a familiar but meaningless pop tune .
443349	819382	52545	5.0	Hope as Insurance Salesman Out West .	I think the kids might enjoy this more than adults . The situations are amusing - - imagine Bob Hope as Jesse James ' bodyguard in Missouri - - but they're kind of slow , a little drawn out , funny in a sitcom way . The punch lines are followed by rather long silences while the audience is supposed to be laughing . The kids might be laughing but the grown-ups , I suspect , are no more than smiling . I'm not a curmudgeon either . I laughed along with my twelve-year-old at some of Hope's earlier Western comedies , like " Fancy Pants . " The usual wisecracks are muted . Slightly off kilter . And I didn't notice any playing with the fourth wall , usually a refreshing surprise . Hope is funny enough as his usual quivering coward , but I miss the fast pacing of his 1940s comedies and the easy exchange of barbs between him and Bing Crosby in the Road movies . Maybe I AM an old curmudgeon .
442554	819382	26121	5.0	Being rich is better .	Rather standard working-class drama of the sort that Warner Brothers was turning out , though with more emphasis on the issue of unions and union-breaking than was usual . The usual stalwart support is present , such as Ward Bond and even Akim Tamirov . Maybe part of the reason it doesn't have more impact on viewers these days is that the working class audience , living on the edge of poverty , doesn't really exist as a social consideration anymore . The people who made this movie and the audience who lived this kind of life are now all dead . Far fewer people know what existence was like when it was constantly overcast by the threat of imminent poverty . In the Great Depression , during which the generation described by Tom Brokaw in his book " The Greatest Generation " grew up , unions were still controversial and there was a good deal of violence involved in the development of collective bargaining . Goons might bash in your head . A union organizer might be ( and at least in one case was ) castrated and murdered . And a miner might blow up a mine . One third of the nation was unemployed and there was no Social Security or Unemployment Benefits . Well , no time for a history lesson here . And it's just as well because I know practically nothing of the history of industrial relations . Considering it as a film , I can only echo what another reviewer , " Howdymax " , in still another of his unusually perspicacious comments , has already said . The movie is Dreck . Try to think of it as an historical artifact , like a Leni Lenape tomahawk or a Roman coin . It's no longer useful but it's oddly fascinating to see and handle . That may help you get past Mr . Paul Muni's outrageous overacting . If he could do it , he would chew up not only the scenery but the walls of the mine shaft , the Miner's Bar , his supporting players , the script , the director , the camera , and the viewer .
441790	819382	50383	5.0	Is there such a thing as trying too hard ?	A based-on-fact story of Jimmy Piersall , a major league player of the 1950s who suffered what looks like a major depression with some paranoid ideas . Not much could be done with major league mental illnesses at the time , before the French accidentally discovered anti-psychotic meds . The movie ends , as all such movies do whenever possible , on an up-beat note with Piersall ( Tony Perkins ) returning to the Red Sox after defeating his demons . I have no idea how closely the movie sticks to the real facts of Piersall's life , but it certainly hews close to the formula line . Basically , everything is blamed on Piersall's father ( Karl Malden ) , who pushed the kid too hard , brutally sometimes , to excel . Nothing would do but that Piersall not only play for the Sox but that he play the OUTFIELD . Shortstop wasn't good enough . Poor kid . While still in the minors , in Scranton , he brags to his pop that he's the third highest hitter in the league . Malden smiles and says , " Well , that's not first . " Think about that , next time your kid comes home with a B plus on his report card . You want to drive him nuts ? I don't doubt that Piersall's father was pushy about his son's training and career . For all we know there may be as many sports fathers as there are stage mothers . But it seems a bit unfair to make him the sole heavy . It's not easy to drive someone crazy , not as easy as it seems in the movies anyway . It helps a lot , especially with major affective disorders , if you bring something genetic to the party , as numerous studies have shown . Not that genetics explains everything , because one identical twin may " get it " while the other doesn't . Anyway , the movie isn't very satisfying , as a movie . The director , Robert Mulligan , has done better work elsewhere . And Tony Perkins gives a by-the-numbers performance as a madman , with his facial muscles trembling and his eyes bulging . How primitive can you get ? He was a much better ( if entirely different ) kind of psychotic in " Psycho . " An improved script might have helped him . Malden is okay as the well-meaning but destructive father whom Perkins finally tells off at the cathartic climax . Perkins ' wife's role is underwritten and doesn't contribute much as Malden's potential rival . It would have been nice too if we'd seen a little more about baseball , the sport and the career ladder , and less of the formulaic material on having a breakdown . At least your performance on the baseball diamond is something you can do something about . In the grip of mental illness like Piersall's , you're practically helpless , and that's not too dramatic .
442616	819382	120787	5.0	A Regular Sheepshank	SPOILERS . It's hard to imagine why they keep remaking classics , aside from the desire to make more money . Frederick Knott's mystery can be played a number of different ways . A TV production some years ago used Anthony Quayle , a splendid actor , as Chief Inspector Hubbard . It followed the script precisely and was dull . This version is updated , more explicit , and more complicated , a sheepshank compared to the original square Knott , and not only isn't an improvement over the play but is well below the standard set by Hitchcock's rendition in 1954 . Hitchcock only made the film because he'd had several flops in a row and needed something safe , something that had already proved its popularity , in order to " recharge the batteries " as he put it . He may have chosen it out of desperation but it is suffused with his idiosyncratic brand of irony , humor , and technique . Who could take Ray Milland as the roguish would-be killer Tony Wendice seriously ? He belongs up there in the pantheon of Hitchcock's villains along with James Mason in " North by Northwest . " Here we have the play spread out over several locations , more violence and blood , and Gywneth Paltrow taking a bath - - none of which really helps much . How can they botch up such a tightly bound plot ? By loosening it , introducing irrelevancies , losing the focus on the misplaced key , throwing in simulated sex , and reducing suspense while increasing the movement of the actors . As the head villain , Michael Douglas plays it dead seriously . He broods a lot . His occasional muted laughter is barren , his smiles as phony as they come . He may be rich as hell but he never seems to be having a good time . Of course it doesn't help when your wife is being boffed by some other guy , even if you don't care much for her . Vigo Mortenson , as the boffer , is the auxiliary heavy , and I suppose looks kind of sexy in a greasy , long-haired , unkempt sort of way , the kind of Byronic figure who cares for nothing except his art and the satisfaction of his sensual appetites , which may appeal to women who enjoy being invited to tame this brutishness , the kind of women who enjoy riding slightly spirited stallions . That's the way the part is written anyway . But Mortenson doesn't deliver on the " fine madness " business . His strong face is almost without expression and his voice close to toneless . He comes across as the con man he really is , underneath that painter's smock . Gwyneth Paltrow is the boffee . Her face is beautiful , architecturally structured . It seems all odd angles and large , queerly slanted blue eyes . Her appeal is a bit goofy , too , rather like her mother's , Blythe Danner's , but very real . Her bony frame under those chic outfits lends her image a gawky elegance . She looks inexperienced , vulnerable , easily exploited , manipulable . If she were a greeting card and you opened her up , she would read , " I'm so sorry . " I won't go into the plot details much except to say that the characters of Mark Halliday and Lesgatt / Swan are combined into one . Losing the key is a killer mistake as far as the narrative is concerned and it can't be made up for by giving additional screen time to big-name Hollywood stars . The direction is plodding , I'm afraid . The most gripping scene in Hitchcock's " Dial M for Murder " is when Grace Kelly answers the phone and keeps asking who is on the other end , while the killer , having appeared from nowhere , is standing in the shadow behind her , poised with a startlingly white scarf , waiting for Kelly to replace the phone so he can get it around her neck . The attempted murder is horrifying . It ends with Kelly grabbing a pair of scissors ( the presence of which , in that particular place , has been carefully but offhandedly explained earlier ) and stabbing the killer . The same scene here is more violent . The director shows us Paltrow being thrown all over the place , sliding on a butcher-block table with her robe flying open so we can get a glimpse of her bare legs ( she just got out of the bath ) , dishes smashing , pots being bonged against each other on the ceiling rack . Paltrow grabs a knife - - and here it comes - - but no . The killer manages to disarm her even while strangling her . ( Insert further description of plates falling , pans clanging , women screaming , Alaska being drilled for oil , a Keystone Kop falling off a cliff , a rotating kaleidoscope , a merry-go-round with the horses riding the children , a heroin addict trying to insert a suppository , and so forth . ) Finally , having run out of ideas , the writers have Paltrow fumble for a gratuitous - - get this - - meat thermometer and plunge it into the guy's neck so that blood shoots out of his carotid artery like a fireman's hose gone berserk . There's gore all over the place . The body seems to lie in gallons of it . There are bloody footprints along the floor , smeared hand prints on the wall , all the way from the kitchen to the bedroom where an incarnadined Paltrow winds up shivering . Maybe it's unfair to compare this murder scene to the way Hitchcock filmed it , but , really , bad taste is bad taste . Well , let's leave the corpse alone . You want to see an enjoyable version of this play ? Try " Dial M for Murder . "
442042	819382	182361	5.0	The Adventure of the Cornish Fraud .	David Suchet as Poirot , and Hugh Frazer as Captain Hastings , take a vacation at a resort in Cornwall , where they meet Magdalena " Nick " Buckley , the beautiful young woman with the startling gray eyes ( Polly Walker ) who lives in the mansion called End House next door . The three are having tea al fresco when Nick , waving her fingers , complains about the bees that fly right in front of your face . She seems to be having a run of bad luck lately because she's barely escaped two accidents ( runaway car , falling boulder ) that would have been fatal . After she leaves , Poirot reveals that he has copped her bonnet . It has a bullet hole through it . It wasn't a pesky bee after all , it was a bullet , and to prove it Poirot produces the bullet , identifying it as having come from a Mauser . This initiates a quiet investigation by Poirot and his sidekick . Nick had recently written a will before her appendicitis operation . Could the motive be money ? Ah , but not . Nick may be living in End House but she is almost penniless and will soon have to move out . Except that her derring-do fiancé now dies in a plane crash and leaves her millions . At Poirot's urging , Nick invites her cousin Maggie to stay with her in End House , along with a few friends already there . But , helas , Maggie borrows a dress from Nick and is shot one night and killed , evidently by accident . Then it gets more complicated and I don't want to go on about it . You know how Agatha Christie's plots work - - everybody seems to be a suspect . And , as often happens , there is some subsidiary or embedded criminal activity involved too - - such as forging a will or trafficking in cocaine - - which tends to throw off the pursuit of the murderer . In the end ( and hereabouts there be spoilers ) , Poirot reveals that both " Nick " and her cousin " Maggie " had the same first names - - Magdalena - - a family tradition . And Poirot reveals that the love letters from the derring-do aviator , as well as his will leaving everything to Magdalena , were intended NOT for " Nick " but for the now defunct cousin " Maggie , " whom Nick deliberately murdered . The atrociously good-looking Nick sneers , calls everyone stupid , admits the murder , and goes off to snuff herself . This is one of those stories that has holes you could drive a Peterbuilt 18-wheeler through . Question . Okay , they're sitting outside having tea and a bullet whizzes through Nick's bonnet . Who fired that shot ? She's been faking all those attempts on her life , so who shot at her ? And how does Poirot , without ever getting out of his chair , produce the pristine Mauser slug that barely missed Mlle . Nick's noggin ? Magic ? Or magnets . Question . At the end , Poirot produces the love letters addressed to Magdalena , and the aviator's will leaving everything to Magdalena . How does he know that they were really addressed to the other DEAD Magdalena , the cousin with whom he was in love ? Poirot and the police don't have a shred of evidence . ( Evidence always comes in " shreds " and is a dichotomous variable - - you either have a shred or , more often , you don't have a shred . ) It's all conjectural . Yet , as in a Columbo episode , the real murderer throws up his hands on such flimsy speculation and says , " Okay , you got me . " The location filming is splendid and the acting is professionally competent and Polly Walker is so succulent that she should have done a gratuitous nude scene , but this plot won't hold water . Usually we can ignore holes in the story but in this case they are so in-your-face that they thrust themselves into your awareness . Or maybe not . I don't know . But I don't think of this as one of Dame Agatha's better-built narratives .
443286	819382	120749	5.0	Bruce Willis as Loose Cannon Cop .	In this one , the FBI are the good guys , more or less . A little naive maybe , except for Bruce Willis . The National Security Agency ( NSA ) are a supersecret group who plant spies all over the place and want to kill a little autistic boy who has accidentally cracked their top secret code . The NSA as a secretive organization ? There's absurdity for you . Anyway , there are a couple of bad guys within the NSA , led by Alec Baldwin , who follow Willis and the kid around . ( " Gloria " , the original , was a far more innovative movie . ) There are some rather mopey scenes between Willis and the kid but more often the kid is a nuisance , screaming and kicking over minor matters like the fact that he can't play with the buttons on the ambulance dashboard and the fact that his mother and father have just been blown away by a murderer from the NSA . The murderer is one of those guys who smiles a lot but has a cruel face and an even crueler haircut . He uses a pistol with a noise suppressor and is absolutely ruthless . There is also the obligatory young woman introduced halfway through the story and she gets swept up in events . The kid isn't required to do much except scream , kick , look distracted , or chant statements repeatedly . In the last few seconds of the film , the kid gets up from his chair , moves slowly over to Willis , and embraces him . The movie , which has been tottering along trying to stay upright , finally collapses entirely in a shuddering heap . The slam-bang action is predictable but okay . But people are liable to come away from movies like this one and " Rain Man " believing that all autistics are savants , which is just not the case . Both conditions are real enough but they don't always occur together . Autistics aren't usually pathetic and charming like this kid either . They don't need other people , they like to tinker with things or play with glittering objects , and they don't like change . They like predictability , so they'd probably like this movie . It's a fascinating condition and nobody knows what causes it . Anyhow , nobody with any experience demands much of a movie like this . But the expectations , however low , aren't met . Forget this .
443049	819382	387055	5.0	Deliberately paced , stylized , abundantly empty .	I guess I'm going to have to give Reygadas A for effort . What we see on screen certainly LOOKS good . The photography is splendid and the human or humanoid figures are memorable in one way or another . It sounds good too . There's no noticeable score but the situational music ranges from rap through military marches to Bach , and the otherwise silent background sometimes is filled with clicking heels , peeps , and ticks . That's about it for me . The residual impression is a failed attempt at an artistic masterpiece . In the opening scene , before the credits , we see the inexpressive face of an ordinary middle-aged man . The camera , always slowly and deliberately , moves down his overblown torso and we see the back of some blond woman's head covering his groin , her hair sprouting up in ungainly spears and tangles . At a glacial pace the camera sidles sideways and we see ( explicitly ) that she is fellating the guy , her movements about as unsprightly as the camera's , and her eyes are closed . The camera moves verrrry slooowly in until we see only her closed lids . They pop open , her irises stare wildly at us , and a tear rolls out of one of them and down her cheek . That's not too bad , but it's an example of the director's technique at just about its peak . A few other scenes are equally shocking but for the most part watching this is like rolling a giant stone up a hill . There are one or two underlying plots in all this artistry . One has to do with a general's daughter , Ana , working for kicks in a cathouse . Several people have argued that this is the only way male directors can think about women with sexual appetites , which strikes me as a pretty cheap interpretation . Anyway , Marco , the fat guy we see in the opening scene is her chauffeur and for some reason agrees to get it on with him . They make love joylessly . " Marco , calm down , " she tells him as he lies there passively , staring at the ceiling . Marco also makes love to his wife , a human butterball , which is like making love to one of the monumental Mayan pyramids at Chitchen Itza . It's easy to make fun of people who are visually imperfect but you have to give these actors credit for being willing to expose their flawed bodies on screen like this . ( I can only make these statements because my own physical manifestation is without blemish . ) Not to say that the young Ana's figure is unusual . She looks pretty good . But all the sex is made to look about as much fun as riding an exercise bicycle . If it were no more alluring a sport than as presented here the human race would have died out thousands of years ago . Well , anyway , it fits the overall gloom of the other story , the one about the child that Marco and his wife kidnapped , the child who died while a captive . The climactic scenes bring the problem of guilt and penance to a head but we don't really get to know much about it until half-way through the film , and then only through minimalist conversation . You know , if you were to play a DVD or a tape of this movie and stop it somewhere at random , you'd probably get an image of two people gazing silently at one another . Failing that , you can expect a tableau of a dozen or so people standing together motionlessly as if they were dolls placed there by a child , staring silently at the camera . There is one spectacular shot in which Ana and Marcos are getting it on and the camera moves verrry slooowly out onto the balcony of the room and then takes us on a slooow tour of the Mexico City neighborhood , looking no better and no worse than any other big-city neighborhood , before completing its 360 degree travelogue and returning to the now-exhausted couple on the bed . It reminded me of the spectacular shot towards the end of Michelangelo Antonioni's " The Passenger . " While Jack Nicholson is getting murdered quietly in his room , the camera passes through the bars of the window and takes us on a scenic tour of the street outside before pulling back through the bars and showing us Nicholson's corpse . I got the point of Antonioni's camera movement . The bars in the window were removable so the camera could get outside and replaceable so it could get back in - - a self-conscious display of technique . This whole movie reminds me of that shot . Still , the visuals are beautiful , the film does have its moments , and a lot of effort clearly went into the production . So they still use storyboards ? Because if they do , this was thoroughly storyboarded . If you're in a contemplative and patient mood , and if you don't mind quite a lot of experimental technique , you should find this film an interesting one .
443446	819382	111143	5.0	Comic Book Adventure .	I don't know why they make these kinds of movies . Just for a chance to spend a lot of money ? I can think of 57 better ways of spending it , beginning with " Send some to me . " Alec Baldwin is handsome and Penelope Ann Miller is yummy and John Lone is a good actor . The sets are phenomenal , the score epic in dimension , the special effects special . The plot , in an exemplary case of arrested development , is stuck at the fifth-grade level . It's hardly worth describing but let's just say John Lone , as the passionate villain Kahn , has made an " atomic bomb " and wants to take over the world with it - - the world as it was in the late 1930s . ( Kahn ? How does a Chinese guy come to have an Arabic name ? Never mind . ) It ought to appeal to kids , what with its dusty sarcophagi creaking open , it's Kung Fu Chinoiserie , its magic daggers and hypnotic trances . There are little tid-bits for adults too . A villain invites the luscious , silk-clad Miller down to the laboratory to see his beryllium spheres , part of the bomb he's working on . " I'm not interested in your spheres , " she tells him with gelid disdain . There was a time when everyone who had a radio tuned in to programs like this - - " The Shadow , " " Inner Sanctum , " " The Whistler , " " Suspense . " ( " The Shadow " often featured the voice of Orson Welles . ) Some of the programs weren't bad , as a matter of fact , and many of them were adapted for noir films of the 40s . " The Shadow " must have been fun for a kid but it's the kind of fun one tends to outgrow , rather like Abbott and Costello . I can see , though , where a family might enjoy this spectacular spectacle . The kids certainly will , and there's just enough in it to keep the adults from nodding out .
442829	819382	33774	5.0	Crook Gives Up Rackets For Succulent Blond .	Robert Taylor is Johnny Eager , one of several Johnnies with strange last names to come out of Hollywood during the 1940s - - Johnny Apollo , Johnny O'Clock , Johnny Belinda , Johnny Logical Positivist , Johnny Be Good , and what not . Of course Taylor has small room for complaint when it comes to names . He was born Spangler Arlington Borough in Nebraska . In this film he's on parole , see , and pretends to be nothing more than your honest cab driver but he really runs some kind of underhanded business involving dog racing . He uses everybody around him , a real nasty guy . The only trustworthy friend he has is the alcoholic Van Heflin . Then Taylor meets and falls for a real classy dame , Lana Turner , born Julia Mildred Turner in Wallace , Idaho , navel of the universe . She's the daughter of the morally upright and thoroughly obnoxious DA , Edward Arnold , who has sent Taylor up the river once and wants nothing more than to find an excuse to do it again . Arnold's character's name is O'Hara but , though he looks a little Irish , he looks a lot more like a German burgher , which is not surprising . He was born Gunther Schneider in New York . Okay . End of names . I don't know what got into me but I feel a lot better now . Taylor really has the hots for Lana Turner and it doesn't come as a shock . She has the beauty and sensuality of a perfectly mature pinot blanc grape , all ready to pop when squeezed . But she's a little stand-offish with Taylor , though obviously attracted to him , so Taylor arranges a phony scene in which she seems to murder someone and he saves her from her mock crime . This puts her in a dependent position and it also gives him a bit of leverage with her father so that illegal activities can be carried on apace . Two birds with one gun . It takes Van Heflin the entire movie to convince Taylor that he's a moral pustule , and in the end Taylor gives it all up for the sake of Lana Turner and his own self esteem . Taylor and Turner were both MGM products and the studio certainly proved its loyalty . Neither could act very well and both had short peaks in their popularity arc , but both kept soldiering on in MGM's movies , aging but still useful in that they didn't get in the way of the scenery . Taylor was a reasonably nice guy , personally if not politically , but as he grew older his features became coarser and he was handed roles that were increasingly villainous and sometimes downright sadistic , as in " Westward the Women , " in which he seems to relish punishing his female charges with a bull whip . Turner's career faded less dramatically . The two characters in this film are obviously from different socioeconomic strata . Van Heflin quotes Richard III to him . And aptly too : " I can smile , and while I smile , can cut your heart out with an ax . " Turner quotes Cyrano de Bergerac of whom Taylor says , " That don't go with me . I don't care how ugly a guy is if he don't go all the way . " Everybody quotes Shakespeare and Rostand and all those other high-falutin ' Greeks and Taylor , a total numbskull , keeps coming up with ripostes like , " Ahh , you're going ' daffy . " The most interesting character , although not the most original , is Van Heflin's Jeff . What's he doing here anyway ? He keeps hanging around Robert Taylor , guzzling whiskey and making moon eyes at his boss . Of course the function of the character is to provide Taylor with a gently reproving superego . " Gee , Johnny , what'd you have to clip her in the mug for ? " But the audience already knows that Taylor is possessed by terpitude , a snake . An equally compelling motive for his being here is that he's got a crush on Taylor - - and maybe vice versa . Not a bad flick . Mervyn LeRoy , of " Little Caesar " , was a decent director . It's just not very original , not nearly as tough as it sounds or as unpredictable or penetrating as was probably hoped .
441873	819382	319262	5.0	Wretched excess .	In movies like " Twister " you only get one real disaster , although admittedly it's a doozie . In movies like " Earthquake " you can get several disasters for the price of one - - the ground shakes , dams burst and cause floods , there may be a fire . In movies like " The Day After Tomorrow " you get no end of disasters , and you flirt with the end of the world too . Let me see . Floods . Tsunamis . Cold snaps beyond belief . Tornadoes . ( No fires . ) A sick child threatened with abandonment . A sick adult who needs medicine that can only be found in a super dangerous place . A gigantic crevasse in the ice into which men and machines fall . ( This will have to do in lieu of an earthquake . ) Hurricanes . Blizzards . Airplane crashes . The doomed team having a final drink of twelve-year old scotch . A middle-aged man hiking in snowshoes from Washington to New York hauling a sled , in order to be with his trapped son because " I promised him . " Other things of similar ilk . I didn't mind so much seeing LA get it . Nothing against the Capitol Records Building ( which takes off in a tornado like a stack of frisbees ) . It's just knowing that the storm is taking along with it several dozen Taj Mahal Motels painted day-glo purple . And the " Hollywood " sign , which , to borrow a phrase , looks like " an explosion in a shingle factory . " On the other hand it was tragic to see New York first inundated by seawater and then frozen solid . The notion of patrons in The White Horse Tavern frozen stiff while still hunched over their chessboards brought tears to my eyes . And the frosty statues in Julius's , immobilized during a sip of a martini , pinkies still pointed upward . Actually , the special effects are very good . The flood in New York is naturally much better than George Pal's justly celebrated earlier version . And there's something appealing about scenes in which people creep about on deserted ships . That , by the way , reminds me of the one big surprise in the movie . Hundreds of people are trapped by the flood on the upper stories of the New York Public Library , shouting at one another , and suddenly everyone goes quiet . A very low rumble is heard from the avenue outside . People rush to the windows and what we see is shocking - - the prow of a huge Russian tanker proceeding uptown with slow majesty . I guess , from reading the " trivia " entries , that the director was serious in his concern about global warming - - as he should be . The movie doesn't really convey that anxiety . I know a little about climatology but the explanation got passed me . ( Maybe the book made more sense . ) As it is , the science we hear is very sketchy and given by fiat . ( Why does atmospheric subsidence over the Canadian north bring with it storm and snow instead of stability and low temperatures ? ) Because Dennis Quaid's model says it does ? Anyway , I was lost . The last ice ages left us with our immediate hominid ancestors ( " Cro-Magnon " ) , woolly mammoths , and who knows what else ? This one seems to leave us in thrall to tropical third-world countries , which should make for an interesting sequel . I enjoyed the movie's visuals . ( It's impossible to comment on the acting . ) What's worrisome is that global warming - - despite a multitude of attempt to muddy the scientific waters - - is now pretty much universally accepted by investigators without vested interests . " The Day After Tomorrow " turns it into an excuse for just another expensive disaster flick . It's worth watching though . That Russian ship groaning past the Public Library is a gem .
442036	819382	43129	5.0	Modest Comedy From Ford .	You have to keep your eyes open to see John Ford as a motivating force behind this slender but still successful comedy . If it weren't for the rituals - - civil and military - - and the booze , well , it would be hard to tell . Dan Dailey is the first man from Punxatawy , West Virginia , to enlist after Pearl Harbor but his boyish thirst for action goes unslaked when he is posted as a gunnery instructor at a local airfield . Two years pass , during which the townspeople who were so proud of him become used to his always hanging around while the war goes on elsewhere . ( Some hero . ) Despite his insistence , the Air Force will not give him combat duty . Instead he collects stripes and good conduct medals at home . His father , William Demarest , is frankly irritated with him . Suddenly Dailey is assigned to a B-17 bound for England , as a last-minute replacement for a crew member . The plane runs out of fuel and Dailey accidentally bails out over France instead of England . Here he is picked up and quizzed by the maquis in the person of Corrine Calvet , tempting as creme brulee . She gives him some important film about the German V-2 rocket sites and , to get him through German lines , pretends to marry him during a loud party . He drinks too much wine and the next morning is hustled aboard a British Motor Torpedo Boat suffering from lack of sleep and a calamitous hangover . The crew of the MTB believe he's sea sick and force feed him a tot of rum which mostly spills down his chest . He delivers the film to the astounded authorities in England . He can barely keep awake so they give him a belt of scotch to revive him . He's immediately flown back to Washington , crowded behind the pilot in a P-38 . He's groggy from lack of sleep so the pilot gives him a shot of cognac which Dailey feebly pushes away . During his report to General Marshall , he mumbles and weaves before passing out , so they try to give him some bourbon to revive him before he is whisked away to a hospital . By this time , Dailey is incoherent and the physicians try to put him in a straight jacket before he manages an escape . He makes it back to Punxatawny on a freight train , staggers to his home and begins to crawl in through the kitchen window . His father mistakes him for a burglar and whops him over the head with a night stick . To revive him , his mother gives him a glass of cooking sherry . Mistaking it for milk , Dailey takes a gulp or two then spews out the rest all over the floor . All is resolved and Dailey is to be given a medal by the president . As he is being flown away , the CO of the local airfield smiles and says , " Remind me to give that boy a good conduct medal . " It's nothing like the comic interludes of " What Price Glory , " more amusing than funny . Dailey worked with Ford on two other pictures and there are a few familiar faces here and there - - Jack Pennick as a drill sergeant . It's never slow . The pace is fast but somehow feels forced , as if Ford were anxious to get through it and begin something that interested him more . A lot depends on Dan Dailey as the central figure , and actually he's pretty good . He never seems to have found a niche in Hollywood . He was tall and was a decent hoofer but was mostly confined to supporting roles or as part of an ensemble . His acting style was bluff and straightforward but perhaps he didn't have the face of a leading man . And he didn't grow into an interesting character actor either . All of it a minor puzzle . Ford didn't provide much help . All of Ford's movies had comic elements in them but , like Alfred Hitchcock , his essays at pure comedy , like " Donovan's Reef , " didn't quite click . Comedy was Howard Hawks territory . It's worth seeing , this movie , a perky and good-natured comedy .
442264	819382	362269	5.0	Doggie Style	They took the easy way out on this one . Liam Neeson - - who , for the first time , I must judge to be in over his head - - gives us a Kinsey who is a prophet without honor in his own country , a scientist first and always , practically a saint . Beginning as an entomologist he finds himself wondering what EXACTLY goes on in the human boudoir . We have to take into account that this is the mid-40s and nobody knows from sex . What I mean is that many believed that if you did something bad to yourself you'd grow hair on your palms . Things like that . A little outre . And here comes Kinsey . What Darwin was to biology , and Freud to psychology , Kinsey was to the physical and social aspects of human sexuality . He used what are called " snowball samples , " which are what you have when , say , you interview one gay guy and ask if he knows any other gay guys that might agree to an interview , and so on . This is not a very good way to get a sample , but Kinsey was operating in difficult times . Not a good sample ? Nobody else HAD any samples ! The chief source of data on sexuality was " clinical experience , " the province of MDs who brought their own ideas to the discussion . Before Kinsey there was only Van deVelde's marriage guide , the most shocking message of which was that sex was for more than just reproduction , and when you went on your honeymoon don't expect to spend all your time coupling in a locked hotel room . Leave some space for skiing . The more literary among us in elementary school would sneak the guide off the library shelves and furtively skim through it looking for the dirty parts . But overall the movie is rather dull . It's a simple-minded picture of Dr . Kinsey , the ex wasp man . He was not only a knight in unshining armor , although he was that too . He was a pretty weird guy . The movie shows him going about gaily collecting " data " , disinterested and coolly eager , but he had a lot more in the way of personal involvement than the movie suggests . There is a scene in which he is alone with a young man in a hotel room and they both agree that on a scale of one to ten - - ten being completely homosexual - - they're about a three . Then they do something about finding out if that's true . That's all we see of Kinsey the man exploring his own sexuality . However he knew something about his bisexuality before undertaking the study , and he explored it in his adulthood . He got his wife into the picture more than once too . And there were group gropes that grew a little , well , what might later have been called kinky . Kinsey enjoyed himself by tying ropes around his penis with plenty of knots ( in the ropes ) and then tugging on it to the point of pain as well as pleasure . There were times when he went a bit too far and suffered unpleasant infections . I hope I'm remembering this accurately . It's mostly from a profile in the New Yorker from some years ago . Now , the REAL Kinsey sounds like an interesting fellow , whereas this paragon of objectivity is rather a bore . He can't seem to talk about much except how badly we need more information on sexual habits . ( He was entirely right about that . ) But he talks like that at parties too , and it gets repetitious after a while . The movie ends sadly , after a cinematic biography whose trajectory is familiar to most of us . Genius has great idea and devotes his life and his talent to its exploration . He goes too far and alienates others . Runs out of money . Loving wife sticks with him . But we all know that though he may have died thinking he was a failure , his work will long outlive him . The direction is flat , the dialog lacks sparkle , and Liam Neeson has a haircut that only Kim il Chong could envy . What an interesting movie could have been made about this man and his career .
443523	819382	162661	6.0	Voloptuous and spooky .	To tell the truth , I was a little confused by the plot . Yes , it's true . The story that used to be on every high school reading list lost me here and there . I can't remember the original , but did it really include so much detail about family trees and inheritances and local conspiracies to hide forbidden truths ? It's hard to believe that it did . It probably doesn't matter that the story is confusing at times because the cinematography and set design are are so resplendently dismal as to be spooky in themselves . And if the constant twilight , the desaturated colors , the late Fall atmosphere , the general gloom of both the interiors and exteriors don't creep you out , there's always the Headless Hessian Horseman with his flailing blades . ( He twirls them around in his hands like a gunfighter's six-shooters and they have this swishing sound . ) The acting is pretty good too . Johnny Depp seems a little stiff at time but maybe the part calls for it . Christina Ricci looks almost edible with her wide forehead , enormous doll-like eyes , and diminutive splanchnocranium . The supporting players are all just fine , including Christopher Lee , with the exception of the kid who serves as Crane's sidekick . He sounds as if he's still practicing his lines . The story has a couple of false starts . Depp is first set up as a kind of visionary Sherlock Holmes type . He has invented new tools for investigating crime scenes . But none of them is explained and he is seen using them only once , for a purpose we can't define . We expect him , based on this early exposition , which leads to his exile from New York City to Sleepy Hollow , to be a scientific genius . But that's soon gotten out of the way . It isn't long before he meets the Horseman himself and realizes he's dealing with the supernatural . At that point , alas , the movie begins to lean more heavily on the clichés of the slasher movie . People do stupid things that put them in danger , for instance . Having just run away from the Horseman and knowing they are still being stalked by him , two guys stop running , turn around , and stare into the fog to see if their pursuer will show up . ( Huh ? ) The constituents of the slasher movie are always there , lurking in the mist , ready to attack at any moment , like the Headless Horseman ( and I DO mean " headless " ) . The very first murder , in the opening few minutes , has a guy in a cornfield get his head lopped off and we see the blood splatter across the face of a Jack o ' Lantern . Almost all the heads are chopped off graphically on the screen although there isn't that much blood , thanks . I suppose that kids , who ought to enjoy this movie , were part of the intended audience so the gore was contained . As for the Horseman himself - - well , I don't think I like him too much . He's presented as an immortal action figure . He's always in motion , galloping a horse at full speed , striding quickly around . He's dressed in a black cloak over black armor , which is alright , but I think he might have been spookier if he'd been less energetic and more of a plodding , implacable menace . The staging of his attacks are low-brow . There are sword fights out of any number of action movies , with two antagonists , flashing blades , twirling figures , swishing and clanking sounds - - all to no purpose since it's already known that the Horseman can't be beaten . At least they didn't throw in any flying kicks from the Chop Sockey movies . But the figure himself is really terrifying , especially when we don't have a clear view of him . The parts I enjoyed most were simply those in which frightened people were whispering in the shadows . The look and the feel of the late 18th-century Hudson Valley are admirably conveyed , though even that is a little too heavily laid on . Can't remember a single scene that takes place in broad daylight . It's as if the sun didn't exist in Sleepy Hollow .
442863	819382	112864	6.0	Bang , bang - - then BOOM .	As with any effective action movie , you're glued to the screen even as you goggle at the stupidity of it all . People get shot , sawed in half by wire ropes , blown up , run over by renegade subway trains , electrocuted by helicopters whose rotor blades make a mare's nest of high-tension power cables . I couldn't count the number of exploding fireballs . There are , I think , three maniacal car chases . ( It depends on how you define car chase . Is a lone cab bounding at full speed through the woods of Central Park a " car chase " ? ) It's like watching a Roadrunner cartoon . Bruce Willis is spat out of an aqueduct tunnel by the force of the water , loops through the air , and plops down into a mud puddle unhurt . " Whew , " he's likely to say , " what a # @ # % ! % # @ ^ % ! ing close call THAT was ! " Samuel Jackson as his unwilling partner matches him step for step , in a plot partly structured along the lines of the old mismatched cop movies that ran out of steam a decade or so ago . Both Willis and Jackson are quite good for reasons most people already will recognize . There's nothing like a blood-covered Willis wisecracking and wincing with real pain as he extracts a piece of shrapnel from his flesh with his own teeth - - unless it's Jackson with his bulging eyes and crackling high voice responding angrily to some racist remark . " Say WHUT ? " I see I've kind of skipped much of the plot but it wanders off in several tenuously related directions anyway ? Jeremy Irons with a faux German accent is the heavy and he belongs in a different movie . Nobody else registers . You know what it's like ? It's like a comic pornographic film . " Debby Does New York . " Exciting episode follows exciting episode and they are linked by only the slenderest of narrative threads . Let's see . That makes it a combination skin flick , mismatched cop movie , and Roadrunner cartoon . Hmmmm . Yeah , I guess that about covers it . It's tense , amusing , and filled with stunts . And if you're in the proper mood it's captivating .
442143	819382	109034	6.0	Captivating Murder Story	This plot-driven story is better than I'd expected it to be . The story is this . An efficient , highly respected cop , Chris Reeves , must cover for his inept younger brother on the same police force . While doing so on one occasion , he is shot by the perp and paralyzed from the waist down . He's retired from the force and is cared for at home by his wife . Reeves passes through various stages of depression and becomes suicidal . He calls his wife ( Cattrall ) and his brother Nick ( Kerr ) together for a talk and tells them that he's concocted a plan to fake his own murder . He's taken out mucho life insurance with his wife , his brother , and his son as beneficiaries . He wants them to establish an alibi , then break into his house as if they were burglars , and shoot him in the head . Double indemnity will then apply and his family will be well off , and he'll avoid the shame of having killed himself . Now - - watch it here , because there be spoilers ahead , important ones . Kerr and Cattrall are not what they seem . Kerr is a shallow guy , a total failure at everything he's tried , despite his brother's help - - self absorbed and naive , and he's been boffing Reeve's wife for some time . Cattrall is the meaner of the two , self pitying , horny , and greedy enough to agree without reservations to Reeve's suicid-by-burglar scheme . The thing is , Reeves KNOWS all this and has set them up . The guns they've been instructed to use are unloaded , whereas Reeves ' pistol is ready to go . Furthermore - - look , mein Fuhrer , he can WALK . Clumsy but ambulatory . So instead of their shooting him , he kills them and claims self defense . Everyone believes him except another cop , Joe Montegna , who can't quite shake the suspicion that Reeves has done exactly what he has in fact done . He comes in for a lot of dish from the rest of the force because they all hold Reeves in esteem . Montegna sticks on the case even though his superiors order him not to . His final attempt to prove Reeves is lying fails and he winds up in the slams and then dismissed from the force . Reeves and his son end up playing baseball together and living happily ever after . Reeves presumably will later learn to walk again in public . And there is that pretty next-door neighbor . It's a pretty good movie . I'll try to make my explanation for that statement brief . As in actual life , nobody is either entirely good or bad . They are all ambiguous characters . Reeve's younger brother may be weak , but he's unable to shoot his brother when he tries . Reeve's wife may be unfaithful to him , but she has a decent job , does what she can to help him , and apparently loves their son . Reeves ' motives are understandable , but excessive by any measure . And the movie itself ends with a murderer getting away with it . Not only that , but Montegna , the only detective who sees through Reeves , must leave in disgrace . Some effort has gone into the plot , and into the dialog as well . When Montegna begins pushing recklessly into Reeves ' status as suspect , the other cops deride him . A fellow officer sarcastically tells him , " You know , you're an obsessive compulsive . You got this obsessive thing . My wife always said you were compulsive . No wonder your wife left you . But the good news is - - you can get help . " The photography and score aren't very impressive . The acting is good on everyone's part . The movie breaks the usual mold from which such movies are cast . Of course it's painful to see Reeves playing a paraplegic . His Superman movies were funny , but only because they were jokes . He was able to put in a good dramatic turn from time to time , as in this movie or in " Street Smarts . " And makeup has given him an unfashionable haircut , the kind a cop might have rather than a movie star . Well worth catching .
442261	819382	252503	6.0	Find the Gold in this Picture .	This would be a rather standard heist / double cross movie if it weren't for the fact that the dialog has Mamet's ink spilled all over it . I mean , look at this plot . A tired old gunslinger , I mean thief , wants to get enough money to retire to South America and get a sun tan with his girl friend ( Hackman and Pigeon , respectively ) . To do it , he's forced to cooperate with a bunch of hoods ( DeVito , Lindo , Rockwell , and Jay ) and pull off one last spectacular heist of a gold shipment from Switzerland . The heist itself is complicated and exciting . The double crosses start immediately afterward and , this having been written by Mamet , the double crosses lead to triple and quadruple crosses . Maybe quintuple , I lost count . It ends up with one of the good guy dead , and two of them surviving and securing the gold . Gene Hackman is always reliable , and Ricky Jay with that big porous nose is like somebody we all know and like . Rockwell is suitably slimy . Danny DeVito I prefer to see in comic roles . Delroy Lindo has a face that belongs on Mount Rushmore and an acting style to match . Rebecca Pigeon is not given much to do except walk around and look sexy , which is just fine . The conventions are surprisingly conventional here . A bop on the head with a gun puts a character out for just exactly as long as the plot requires . A real bop would be more likely to stun the victim for a few seconds or put him in the hospital with a concussion . And there is a wild shootout at the end . Mamet's direction is functional and straightforward . He saves all his razzle dazzle for the dialog which varies from the elliptical to the inane . " She's cute , isn't she ? " " As a Chinese baby . " It's a well organized film , though it has holes in the plot . Some of the situations I still haven't figured out . But it's engaging and keeps a viewer involved , and the locations in Montreal and Vermont and Cape Ann are marvelously evoked . In those latitudes there is a refreshing omnipresent crispness in the air even at mid day and the sun is so near the horizon that it seems to turn the sea and everything else silver rather than gold . I recall waking up in the back seat of my car , near Sault Ste . Marie , after midnight hearing all the dogs of nearby farms howling and the sky ablaze with Northern Lights . In the middle of July . Spooky stuff , but there's none of that in this film , which focuses on the much spookier subject of human ethics .
443157	819382	38975	6.0	Effective , spooky , Victorian murder mystery .	Dorothy McGuire plays Helen , a mute maid in the Victorian mansion owned by the ailing , bed-bound Ethel Barrymore . It's never a good time to be mute , but this is a particularly bad period because someone is going around in the nearby town and killing young women with imperfections . The constable comes around to warn that the clues seem to point to Barrymore's mansion , so look out . There are plenty of people in the mansion to look out for . There are Barrymore's two sons - - the older professor , George Brent , and the young cocky womanizer , Gordon Oliver . There's the ravishing Rhonda Fleming , of whom Oliver remarks , " I never realized your hands were so strong . " There's the hefty , bitter nurse , Sara Allgood , who never has a good word for anybody . There's Elsa Lanchester as a charwoman who spends most of her time dead drunk or planning to get so . There's her husband , Rhys Williams , uncouth , unkempt , menacing . And then there's Barrymore's doctor , Kent Smith , who falls in love with McGuire , while she reciprocates . Yes , plenty to go around . This is a big mansion . It's a NEAT mansion too , come to think of it . Daryll Silvera was the set dresser and he seems to have gotten everything just right - - the ugly portraits on the walls , the overstuffed furniture , the kerosene lamps , the ugly kitchens , the cobweb-ridden cellar , the potted palms , the elaborately curved dark wood of the paneling and the artfully gnarled staircase . It's even better when there's an electrical storm raging outside and the wind blows out the candles . We soon conclude that someone in the house is doing all these murders - - but which one of them ? Certainly not McGuire . She's the requisite woman-in-jeopardy . Ethel Barrymore is glum and seems to be hiding something , but she's bed-bound . ( Or is she ? ) The professor ? He's aloof , true , but he reacts with sensible concern to portentous news . There's the vain and imperious Rhonda Fleming , but she's eliminated as a suspect simply by means of transition to victimhood . The arrogant younger son , then ? Much too obvious . Ditto for Rhys Williams and , unless she's faking it , the bibulous Elsa Lanchester . Well , how about Kent Smith , as Dr . Parry ? Oh , he LOOKS benign enough , placid of countenance , pacific of demeanor , soothing of voice . But at one point , he tells the younger brother that he'd like to break his neck . Is that a hint of suppressed violence ? Probably not . Kent Smith is the long-suffering husband of Simone Simon in " The Cat People . " His specialty is passivity . He could never kill anybody . Besides , he's a Harvard man and it would be rude . When this film was released , it was accompanied in advertisements by a warning that young people shouldn't attend . They might be too frightened . Today , that should give us quite a laugh . It's a dark and brooding murder mystery set in an old house and although there's a good deal of suspense , there is no violence to speak of . Nicely atmospheric film , though I don't know that that would appeal to some in today's audience who would be impatiently waiting for the ax to appear .
442583	819382	734550	6.0	A golden age .	This is one of the better episodes of the series , though it's no more than a variation on a common theme of Serling . ( The best example is called something like " A Short Walk to Town , " with Gig Young . ) Here , J . D . Cannon is Serling's alter ego , a business executive constantly being shouted at and told to " Push ! Push ! Push ! " He commutes to his home in Connecticut by train , falls asleep , and is awakened by a conductor who tells him that this stop is Willoughby . As he looks out he finds everything to be a golden age of good nature and innocence , everything the world he lives in is not . But he doesn't leave the train and when he wakes up next he is back home , facing his irritable wife . At the next confrontation with his boss he walks out , takes the train , falls asleep , and awakes again at the Willoughby stop , which he has learned doesn't exist . He gets off the train and joins the Tom-Sawyerish kids and listens to the town band , while the train departs . Fade : A hearse is picking up Cannon's body from the tracks after he jumped off the train . The hearse is from the Willoughby Funeral Home . Willoughby , for whatever weight of significance it may hold , is a small town in Ohio near Yellow Springs , where Antioch College is located . Heaven lies in the past . Anyone who argues otherwise is under twenty-one and is right . Serling led a constructive and turbulent life - - wounded in the paratroops - - a nice Jewish kid who went to Antioch on the GI Bill . He seems never to have forgotten his boyhood in Binghamton , New York , a small unattractive town at the time , with slate sidewalks . But to him - - well , he died in his 50s of endocarditis . One hopes heaven is like Willoughby .
442295	819382	73906	6.0	A celebration of testosterone .	A story of the kidnapping of a young woman ( Candace Bergen ) and her two children by Morrocan brigand Raisuli ( Sean Connery ) and his band of warriors . The episode begins with Bergen having tea in her garden with her elderly British guest . The sudden quiet is broken by Berber horsemen crashing through the lattice work . They slice down the Brit with their sword , then go on to vandalize the place , chopping up unarmed servants as well , before tying up Bergen and her kids and putting them on horses to be taken away . Before they leave , though , Connery's robe flies up , covering his face , and his horse whirls through some trees and bushes until he is de-horsed and falls flat . Bergen has been watching this , and when Connery does a pratfall she laughs at him . Why is this woman laughing ? Well , it shows she has character . And it gives Connery a reason to slap her and re-furbish the masculinity he'd lost , at the expense of a subordinate . But does it make sense ? Let me put it this way - - if you had just seen your house destroyed and your friends get their heads lopped off , and you were a woman who had no idea where she and her kids would be taken or what would be done to them , would you have laughed under those circumstances ? The same disjointedness shows up elsewhere in the film , as people do improbable things . The ugly German cavalry officer - - the others look plump , like Bismarck , but this guy is just ugly and never laughs - - is in the middle of a battle with Connery and his men . He has Connery in the sights of his Mauser . Connery , smiling and unafraid , raises his sword in salute and challenges the German officer to mano a mano combat with swords . The German puts away his pistol , draws his sword , and accepts Connery's offer as asked . ( He's not only ugly . He's stupid too . ) There are a lot of battle scenes in this , and they're well handled . There are also two important relationships that we follow . There is Connery and Bergen , and Connery and President Teddy Roosevelt ( Brian Keith ) who are in a kind of long-distance duel . Plenty of intrigue too , including an incident in which the U . S . Marines attack the palace of the Morrocan Hefe at Fez . It's neatly directed . The Marines , backed up by armed sailors , double time it to the palace entrance . The Captain is shouting orders , and the Marines precisely follow them , left face , hostiles to the left , aim , and fire . There are a dozen or so palace guards standing on the steps watching all these goings on . They are armed but nonplussed . They take no steps to defend the palace or themselves . They just glance at one another , hoping for an explanation . Ka-BOOM , and they are all dead . The problem I have with this sort of thing is that I have a feeling the writer / director , John Milius , approved of it and got a kick out of directing it . ( The innocent palace guards may deserve to have been slaughtered because they weren't ready enough to kill the Marines . ) He's a genuine gun freak , and in a recent TV movie about Teddy Roosevelt , he has the men in the middle of battle inspiring each other and themselves by shouting passages from Shakespeare's Henry V , about having " fought on St . Crispan's Day " . I get the feeling that the people behind the story didn't really mind scenes in which men killed one another . We always know who to root for . Men have notions of honor , and women can have spunk , and Milius finds that inspiring . Before the takeover , an American consular official asks the Marine captain what they're next movie might be . The camera moves in for a big close up of the captain's grinning face as he says , about to pop with anticipatory excitement , " Military intervention . " The Vietnam war was on everyone's mind while this was shot and released and , by God , maybe we didn't get what we wanted in Southeast Asia but we got it in this fictional intervention in North Africa . This film may have been America's first attempt at a virtual victory in Vietnam . It was to be followed by innumerable Rambos and Chuck Norrises and many others . We managed to win in Vietnam a dozen times over . The general attitude is conveyed in some dialog given to Roosevelt , just after he's shot and killed a huge grizzly bear near Yellowstone . " The world will never love us . They may fear us . Respect us . But they'll never love us . " It's too bad that sociology had not yet developed the concept of the self-fulfilling prophecy . If they had , someone might have pointed out this statement as a good example of it . Or , as in the sociologist W . I . Thomas put it , " If men define situations as real , they are real in their consequences . " You think someone doesn't like you ? That absence of affection is easily arranged . Just treat him the way you'd treat someone who doesn't like you . I enjoy this film once in a while . The direction is efficient , the battles exciting , the photography and location splendid , and the acting is quite good by almost everyone - - particularly Sean Connery and Brian Keith . Everybody seems to make fun of Candace Bergen's acting efforts but I don't know why . She does pretty well in the role of the unflappable victim who is constantly surprising Connery by her defiant attitude . And the film has its amusing moments .
443551	819382	45919	6.0	If God had meant man to fly . . . .	Ernest K . Gann has an idiosyncratic prose style , precious and precise at the same time . He tends to use a lot of interior monologue and description and he throws in little unexpected tidbits - - " And where , pray tell , is home ? " Reading his work is a little like flying an airplane . Nothing much happens , but when it happens , it happens fast . " The High and the Mighty " , a novel , has just enough dialog and action to make a conventional movie . His meandering memoir , " Fate is the Hunter , " has mostly a few clipped exchanges of dialog , which I guess made it next to impossible to film . In making the movie of " Fate is the Hunter , " all they kept was the title , which was nice and commercial . I haven't read Gann's " Island in the Sky " , but there are enough flashbacks and narrations in the movie ( by actors and by an omniscient observer who is allowed to voice Gann's finely phrased expressions ) that the book must have been full of the author's reflections and the action was sparse . The story is simple . Dooley ( Wayne ) is piloting a DC-3 over Canada when it ices up and he must land on a frozen lake in an unexplored woodland . His buddies get together and fly around looking for him , sometimes just barely missing him . Just as the crew's supplies are about to run out , they find him and drop supplies and note his position for a rescue team . One of the crew has frozen to death . I saw the movie when I was a kid and thought it was great . It was shown on TV recently and it now strikes me as good rather than great because I think I have a better handle on the meaning of the word " great . " Really , the movie grabs you . Very suspenseful stuff , done in a craftsmanlike manner . Will they ever find Dooley and his crew ? You don't really know until the climax , although , knowing Wayne's image at the time , it would be hard to imagine that he would appear in a film that closed on a shot of him frozen stiff like the Reclining Buddha . ( I mean , the guy hesitated before admitting he had lung cancer because it might damage his public image ! ) The location shooting around Truckee in the Sierras is nice - - black figures scuttling around on blazing white snow - - but the picture cries out for color . The crisp beauty of the setting would have contrasted with the nearly doomed situation of the crew . It's an enjoyable movie partly because so many of the faces in it are familiar ones - - I won't bother to list them . And the performances are all pretty good , except , I suppose , we could have done without Dooley's navigator breaking into tears at his failure to specify their exact location . The scene is overacted , as are some others , and the director should have reined in the excess of statement . There are some other signs of directorial laxity . We can hear the wind whistling loudly but the branches aren't moving . Only rarely does an actor's breath turn to steam - - and it's 40 below . The scene in which the copilot freezes to death , only a few feet from the airplane , is in its own crude way heartbreaking . The weaknesses I've mentioned probably won't bother kids any more than they bothered me when I was a kid . Good suspense , good atmosphere , decent acting , magnificent shots of airplanes over the unexplored woods of northern Canada , desperation and relief , add up to a watchable film . Worth catching .
441781	819382	483726	6.0	Williams is funny but movie devolves .	Robin Williams , a TV satirist , runs for president as a joke and because of a glitch in the electronic voting machines , he wins . Everyone is stunned . Williams ' manager , Christopher Walken is stunned , partly because the percentage he will take of Williams ' presidential salary is so much smaller than what he was getting when Williams was a monumentally successful comedian . Laura Linney is stunned when she discovers that the voting machines developed some kind of complicated glitch based on the double letters in the names of candidates like Mills , Kellogg , and Dobbs and elected Dobbs ( Williams ) by mistake . Jeff Goldblum as the head of Delacroy , the company that manufactured and programmed the voting machines , is more aptly described as concerned than stunned . When Linney discovers the error and wants to correct the election results , Goldblum sets out to correct Linney . The programming error had to be inadvertent because the movie isn't ballsy enough to suggest anything else . Williams comes up with his usual gags , most of them successful . He wants " freedom of religion " , where a person can be Buddhish , part Buddhist and part Jewish , so they can sit and wait for the item to go on sale . He's the best part of the movie , wearing his phony George Washington costume to Congress and complaining that his buckled shoes confused him . He couldn't decide whether he was a Pilgrim or a pimp . Next laurels should go to Christopher Walken as the practical , cynical show-biz manager . When it is revealed that his client's election was a fraud , he shrugs . So what ? The whole thing is a fraud anyway . ( His character's name is Mencken . ) Linney is given a chance to stretch her chops in a breakdown scene in a Starbucks , after she's been mugged and pumped full of every drug under the sun by Goldblum's agents in an attempt to discredit her before she squeals . ( Lord help Delacroy stock if the word gets out . ) She drops her coffee cup , gets paranoid and accuses strangers of going through her purse , and is carted away in an ambulance . Her performance was , I thought , brimming with verisimilitude , reminding me so much , as it did , of an ex girl friend . He handles the dramatic scenes as well as anyone could . The problem is that the dramatic scenes stink . The second half has Laura Linney running from place to place , pursued by Goldblum's Goons , and trying to reach Williams and convince him that his election was a mistake . Here you will find every cliché in the book . Linney doesn't know she's being watched by a heavy from a parked car as she runs to a phone booth out in the middle of nowhere and frantically phones Williams . Guess whether the car revves up and smashes through the isolated phone booth . When Linney finally reaches Williams on their cell phones , he's on his way to an airport to catch a plane and she only has a few minutes to convey her important information about the computer problem . The script causes her to do what every character with an important message must do under these conditions . She goes to pieces , tries to explain the mechanics of the glitch , falls all over herself , and produces what might charitably be called word salad . " You need help , " Williams tells her sadly . There are car pursuits , phone taps , everything you'd expect from a Grade B thriller . Too bad . The movie could have gone in the direction of " Primary Colors , " mixing comedy and realism . It might have gone in the direction of " The Parallax View , " with a deliberate sabotage of the voting system . But it does neither . I can't imagine its offending anyone . It has no politics whatever , as far as that goes . Williams is an Independent candidate who is " for " freedom of religion , improving the educational system ( " half the kids think that Joan of Arc was Noah's wife " - - he thinks he's kidding ? ) , health care , world peace , ridding the capitol of special interests , addressing environmental issues , making it easier to extract DVDs from their cases , and - - yawn . I wish someone would harness Williams ' talent more effectively . The guy is brilliant in his own unquiet way . He can do drama as well as comedy ( " Insomnia " ) , but he's made some mighty purple script choices . " Patch Adams " anyone ? At any rate I'm glad he wasn't elected . We've had enough clowns in the White House lately . We don't need any more . What we need now is some kind of civil engineer who can build something out of the rubble .
443456	819382	43590	6.0	Glory .	Perversely , the thing reminds me of " Glory , " without the taken-for-granteds . I mean , now we take for granted that African-Americans are as good in the military as anyone else . ( God knows , they were the tidiest sailors on my ship . ) But at the time this film was released the accomplishments of the 442nd were still news to most people . Japanese ? Fighting on OUR side ? Gosh . Alas , the performances leave a lot to be desire . Van Johnson does no more than a workmanlike job , and the Japanese soldiers are hard to distinguish . It isn't that they all look alike so much as that so many are given similar motivations . Only two of the enlisted men are really outstanding - - the bitter guy ( the equivalent of the Denzel Washington figure in " Glory " ) and the educated guy ( the Andre Braugher character in " Glory " ) . It's a good move though , and the action scenes are right up there among the better ones . Particularly good is the wounded guy wielding the mortar all by himself . Mortars don't ordinarily loom large in combat movies , although read Sledge's " With the Old Breed . " Weaknesses ? Not too many . One outstanding is that Van Johnson's racism is not made more explicit . Throughout , he objects to his assignment because , mainly , he wants to stay with his Texas division . His racism is sort of , well , masked . Good movie though . Stay way from the only available DVD , which is junk .

He is sprung by Lauren Bacall , an American doctor's daughter who is also the leader of a nearby village . His Mission : To shepherd the entire village of 180 people on a stern-wheeled ferryboat down the Chinest coast to sanctuary in Hong Kong where a man can breathe free and wear something other than ballet slippers on his big Caucasian feet . Of course there is a large family of communists in the village and they must be taken aboard too , to save them from reprisals . They don't seem to appreciate this gesture because they poison the food supply aboard the boat and stage a mutiny during a terrific storm . Well , it's okay , though because they all convert in the end except the pompous , bloated family head who moans his humiliation out loud just before being blown to bits by a shell from a Chinese destroyer . The Chinese villagers are a zany laff riot . They include such dyed-in-the-wool Asians as Paul Fix ( Dobbs Ferry , NY ) , Paul Mazurki ( Ukraine ) , Berry Kroger ( Texas ) , and Anita Ekberg ( Sweden ) . Anita EKBERG ? There's also one of those cigar-smoking Oriental wise guys who serves as chief engineer , a pregnant woman , lots of children and old people , and all that . Wayne took over as the star when the director , William Wellman , fired Robert Mitchum for pushing the Transportation Director into San Francisco Bay , claiming it was just " a practical joke . " And Wayne hefts his bulk around effectively enough . The visuals are pretty good . The film was shot around San Francisco and Suisun Bay and on the Sacramento River but the production design gives a pretty good imitation of what we imagine the coast of China to look like . Lots of fog . The old paddle-wheeler skulks among the reeds . There is a " graveyard of ships " , old hulks piled alongside one another , drying and rotting , where wood for the boiler is gathered . A kid would have a heck of a good time crawling in and out of those skeletal remains . And it's exciting too , though we don't doubt for a moment that the ship and the majority of its crew and passengers will make it to Hong Kong . Wittingly or otherwise the writers have caught some of the features of East Asian culture . When the food is poisoned and must be dumped overboard , the passengers crawl around on the floor picking up individual grains of rice . And the grand ballroom or whatever the compartment is called , serves as a giant bedroom at night with sleeping bodies all over the deck . In the morning , the mats are rolled up , stacked tidily against the bulkheads , and , lo , the bedroom is now the grand ballroom again . I lived with Koreans of modest income for a while and that's kind of how it's done . Every scrap of nutrients is made use of . When they boil rice in a pot of water , the cooking water is served as a beverage along with the rice . And the bedroom cum living room was a simple fact of life . The dialog has nothing much to recommend it . When Wayne is faced with the difficult task of telling Bacall that her father has been stoned to death by the Commies , he slaps her across the jaw and tells her , " That's right . Get mad . Get GOOD and mad . Then ya'll be ready for what I have ta tell ya . " Wayne also gives the speech that converts the Commie villagers to capitalism or democracy or whatever they're converted to . " Your old China is dead ! " he announces . Actually , we can't be sure he's right . China has a long long history of being conquered by internal or external agencies and it has usually taken them about 500 years to shake off the yokes . The Commies still have 442 years to be gotten rid of . You know what would have given this movie a good kick in the pants ? Not that it needs one . But - - okay , Lauren Bacall is good enough in an inessential role . But imagine Gong Li as the doctor's daughter ! Whew .
442976	819382	97493	6.0	Critique of Pure Shalloness	Hard to understand why some people become leaders if they have no more in the way of personal qualities than the rest of us . No - - I mean high school , not politics . In a way , high school status spheres seem to echo those of the society around them . The men compete for power and the women for popularity . In " Heathers " the most powerful boys are on the football team and the most popular girls are the best groomed and prettiest , in this case the three girls named Heather . Veronica ( Ryder ) is an acolyte . The lower rungs on the status ladder are represented by a tall girl with thick glasses and an ordinary pony tail instead of an elaborate coif whose name is Betty . ( Betty and Veronica ? Is this a literary allusion ? ) On the lowest rung of all is " Dumptruck " Dunnstock , an overweight reject . Christian Slater is Dean , the new boy in school , whose mother committed suicide and whose father rejoices in destroying wetlands and endangered species and historic landmarks through his demolition company . How Slater's dad chuckles as he watches the collapse of a big hotel on VHS . Basically , the story is this . Slater and Ryder kill the chief Heather by accident and fix the death up to look like a suicide . Slater then finagles Ryder into shooting and killing two stars of the football team , leaving a suicide note claiming the deaths were the result of a lovers ' pact . Teen suicide acquires a kind of cachet because , after all , people come to your funeral and laud you and your picture appears on TV and all , so other innocent teens begin to attempt suicide . Slater gets swept up in the destruction until by the end he has an apparatus in place to take out the entire high school , but Ryder has come to her senses and prevents him , after which Slater blows himself up . Lots of laughs here . Actually it's a pretty acid comment on being a teenager today . And let's face facts . It does give you ontological pause to discover that you have every material thing you need and therefor nothing to live for except 15 minutes of fame . None of these kids experiences anything remotely resembling a Calvinist " calling . " Whatever they're studying is never brought up . Nobody has ambitions that go beyond acceptance to " an Ivy League college , and please let it be Harvard . " I can believe their anxiety . I can believe their shallowness and spitefulness and cruelty and narcissism . Heather # 1 is defined by a sticker in her locker - - " I Shop , Therefor I am . " What's harder to believe is that Heather # 2 has read " Moby Dick " and has even underlined passages in it . As it appears in this movie , this is a generation that has lost touch with its cultural data base . A joke about a new novel , " Moby Dick , Part Two : Ahab's Revenge " , would be lost on them . They wouldn't get a reference to King Kong . The dialog is pretty snappy , the acting generally okay , and the gradually revealed bitterness in the script makes it different from most movies about teens . Yet the subject of middle-class high-school cliques has been so overdone that it's a little tedious to watch still another spiel , along the lines of " Clueless " and " Pretty in Pink " and the rest of them . Ho hum . It's interesting to note though that the farther removed in years I am from my high school days the more interesting high school cheerleaders in those tiny-skirted carnival-bright outfits become . Not just because they're attractive . All young girls are willy nilly attractive and sexy . It's their innocence that's captivating . Imagine being so willing to lend your allegiance to an organization that you are willing to dress up that way and jump around on a wooden floor , shaking your pom poms and kicking your bare legs up in front of hundreds of strangers . The film makers kind of missed the boat there . The school can't be all THAT dead with such a naked affirmation of devotion on the basketball court . Fewer movies about suicide and more movies about high school cheerleaders , I say .
442017	819382	33740	6.0	Proto-noir	Betty Grable as the heroine has that cream-fed complexion and chirrupy optimism of the American Midwest . She doesn't really belong in what purports to be a film noir . Well , it isn't a film noir anyway , exactly . It's a murder mystery set in the kind of uptrodden Manhattan milieu in which people like Alan Mowbray as an aging ham hang out , drinking champagne , smoking endless cigarettes , and making urbane wisecracks . The non-noir elements , the film blanc elements , so to speak , create the kind of environment that suits Betty Grable well . The women are in cocktail dresses and the men in tuxedos adorned with carnations , like a Fred Astaire movie , or like the one she made with Astaire years earlier , " The Gay Divorcée . " The angles are sometimes crooked and tilted , though , and the lighting does at times cast strange shadows from oddly placed lights - - chicken-wire cages , venetian blinds . But the characters , for the most part , belong to an old , familiar genre . Victor Mature is breezy in double-breasted suits and triple-breasted grins . The police who are hunting the killer of Betty Grable's sister are nasty but not rough . Mature , being grilled as a suspect in the murder , insults them and gets away with it , without his head being turned to squash . The only truly noir figure in the film is Laird Cregar , almost always shot from below , the lighting emphasizing his porcine features . He's sinister in a way no one else in the film is . And that voice ! Insinuating , soft but rapacious . Towards the end of the film , you're convinced he's going to be the murderer , but no - - the solution to the mystery is shrugged off in a few seconds and lands instead on the shoulders of poor Elisha Cook , Jr . , a creepy mouse . Not that the bulky and threatening Cregar is let off the hook entirely . He turns out to be what we would now call a fetishist . I won't describe the details but he puts an end to his self loathing in a way that turns him very neatly from uncovered villain to pathetic nobody . Summing it up , a kind of upscale murder drama shot with the noir techniques that were to become so common in films over the next fifteen years or so . This was 1941 . The unquiet lighting and camera angles are there but they hadn't found the right property yet .
441627	819382	115736	6.0	Nifty B Thriller	With very little effort you could visualize this on the screen of some neighborhood theater - - The Ritz or the Bijou or the Mayfair - - in , say , 1949 . Only then it would be in black and white . The credits take about 90 seconds to unroll . It stars people like Edmond O'Brian and Adele Jergens and Marie Windsor and Ted DeCorsia . It's not called " Bound , " though . I'm having a little trouble putting that together . It's called something more like " The Big Con " or Edge of Darkness " or " Where Danger Lives . " " Bound " is a bit too suggestive even for 1949 . " Bound " is a B movie . The script is pretty elementary , the film has no bankable stars , everybody double-crosses everybody else , and it's cheaply made . But it's updated through the direction , which gives us not just some hood holding a snub-nosed . 38 at his hip and shooting someone once . Instead , the hood holds his big pistol sideways and at eye level . Okay , this makes no sense . If you're going to hold it high enough to take aim , why hold the weapon sideways ? The answer , I guess , is that that's how it's done in modern thrillers . Frankly , I blame Bruce Willis for this . He was the first to use this self-defeating convention on screen , that I know of , in " Die Hard . " It's updated too in that the director has more freedom . So , for instance , the camera can climb up an apartment wall and then OVER the top into the apartment next door . And , people aren't usually shot just once but several times . Sometimes many times . Bullet holes and blood all over the place . And when shot , the victim doesn't simply grasp his belly and grimace , then twirl around and crumple to the floor . He throws out his arms , slips around on a floor covered with bone-white latex interior paint , dripping blood in artsy patterns onto the slickness . It could be grand opera , except that sometimes the victim has time enough , though bullet-riddled , to raise his finger as if lecturing the shooter and make some absurd wisecrack - - " Please don't shoot , " in this case . And it's updated also because the two lovers take off with the boodle to live happily ever after , we guess . In 1949 the lovers would have been maybe Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Ryan . Here the lovers are two lesbians . ( Some nice , but not hot sex between them is thrown in for the voyeurs . ) And although they are both pre-verts and at least one of them has murdered somebody in cold blood , the getaway vehicle in the final scene doesn't plunge off a cliff , as it would have had to in 1949 . What I mean is , did Hannibal Lecter die at the end of " Silence of the Lambs " ? No - - and he ATE people . Times have changed . Gina Gershon with her protruding lips could pass for an ex inmate . Jennifer Tilly's voice is a slow , wispy croak and she comes across as the dark side of the moon of Melanie Griffith . The Italian mobsters weren't too impressive , but Joe Pantoliano was great as usual . He can play almost anything . Here he covers his Jersey City accent with a reasonably authentic Chicago sound , although perhaps nobody but Pantoliano would catch it , or would care if they did . Interesting minor flick , worth watching .
442740	819382	35438	6.0	Colorful training camp romance .	The plot is nothing much new . An older , experienced aviator ( Preston Foster ) is hired as a civilian instructor at Thunder Bird Airfield in Arizona . His missions : ( 1 ) To shepherd a class of American , British , and Chinese novices through primary flight training , and ( 2 ) to woo an old girl friend , Gene Tierney , who happens to live on a ranch next to the field . One of his British students is the elegant-sounding and clean-cut young John Sutton . The poor guy used to be a doctor but then volunteered for the RAF , a position for which he seems manifestly unsuited . He gets airsick and is acrophobic , like me . Encouraged by his aunt , the no-nonsense Dame May Witty , he does his best to overcome his defects . After some initial flights , Foster says he's going to wash Sutton out but Sutton begs for another chance and Foster relents , for now . That's not all that's going on though . The ability to fly is one thing , but then there's Gene Tierney to contend with . Wow . Sutton and his co-cadet Richard Haydn ( the voice of the caterpillar in " Alice in Wonderland " ) run into Gene Tierney in a dress shop . They admire her legs and she taunts them , flirtatiously , and leads them on . Preston's love for Tierney , if that's what it is , in unrequited but Tierney and Sutton get along quite well together . Did I mention her legs ? Did I mention her facial features ? She looks like the result of a mating between a Chinese porcelain doll and a fox . But never mind the romance . That's ground . The figure is the flying . The director , William Wellman , was a flier himself and though this was strictly a contractual obligation , his fascination with airplanes illuminates the film . I can only think of a few other films that have so successfully captured the exuberance of flying biplanes in their colorful pre-war paint schemes in the blue and crystalline air of Arizona . Such beauty for such an ugly end . If you find the romantic theme music familiar or appealing , it's written by Harry Warren for another movie about ice skating in the same year , 1942 . The title is " There Will Never Be Another You , " and it's entered the Great American Songbook . You can download it from anywhere . There's not much else to be said about the movie . The performances are all professional , the plot is the result of innumerable recyclings , and the visual imagery is splendor itself , especially the girl and the airplanes . Did I mention her legs ? A cheerful and diverting way to spend an hour and a half .
442364	819382	31514	6.0	Worth seeing once .	The story is almost rudimentary . An honest plain-speaking working man , Francois , is in love with a fresh-faced young Francoise , but she begins hanging around with an older man burdened with a diabolically sinister face , Valentin . The older man travels around with a trained dog act and a pretty but worn assistant , Clara , who falls in lust with Francois , much to the annoyance of Valentin . Actually neither man cares much about Clara . They both have their eyes on Francoise . There is a big argument between the two men in Francois ' room and Francois shoots and kills Valentin . The police surround the room in which Francois has hunkered down . He broods about the events in flashbacks , then shoots himself . Fin . Maybe I was expecting too much because the movie is generally regarded as a classic of its kind . " Poetic realism " ? The subtitles are sometimes far enough off to be amusing . The acting is nothing to write home about , but the direction is functional and the success of the movie - - and it IS successful - - hangs on the characterizations . Absolutely nobody is entirely sound morally . Take Francois ( Gabin ) . Yes , he's honest , plain-spoken , ordinary looking , and honest - - he hates people who lie . But , well , there's the business of that rather nasty murder . Valentin has just insulted the beautiful Francoise but he's also suggested that Francois is a pedophile for wanting her . It's at that point that Francois picks up the pistol and plugs the other guy . Is he responding with such fury to the insult aimed at Francoise - - or the one aimed at himself ? In either case , the insult is delivered casually , almost jokingly , and hardly an excuse for such an explosion of rage . And we can't overlook the fact that - - insult or no insult - - Francois is shooting and killing a rival for his girl friend's affections . All through the movie , Francois has shown himself to be ill tempered and the murder seems not much more than a logical expression of that character flaw . Valentin is evil looking alright . His eyes seem pasted onto the sides of his head . He wears a loud phony checked overcoat , as opposed to Francois ' working kit . He waves his hands dramatically . He lies fluently - - at one point claiming to be Francoise ' father . A roguish fellow , the sort , as he explains to the slightly dull Francois , that interests women , while Francois is the sort that women fall in love with . He's probably more perceptive than anyone else in the movie , even about himself . " People loathe me . I am a figure of ridicule , " he tells himself in the mirror . He's obviously meant to be some kind of bad guy . Why doesn't he leave Francois and Francoise alone to live happily ever after . Why does he keep NUDGING them ? Okay , but that's hardly enough justification for his murder . Anyway , his possessiveness towards Francoise does raise an interesting question . Not about Valentin but about Francoise . What is her game anyway ? She seems to like Francois well enough and kisses him warmly once in a while , and she keeps his photo on her mirror , although when he proposes marriage to her ( more than once ) she guides the conversation in a different direction . She turns down Francois ' offer of a soirée to watch Valentin perform in the café , but although she applauds enthusiastically and allows him to shepherd her around , she never seems to care that much for him . All in all , she's a blank . The complexity of the characters adds a layer of meaning to the movie that the plot simply can't supply . I was glad I watched it , in the same way I'd be happy to take another peek at the Mona Lisa , because everybody says its so good . But I don't think I'd watch it again .
443137	819382	94608	6.0	No Means No .	This is a pretty decent movie in its direction ( Jonathan Kaplan ) and its principal performances ( Jodie Foster , as a gang-rape victim , and Kelly McGillis is the prosecuting Assistant District Attorney ) . In the opening scene we see Foster running out of a bar and onto a highway , sobbing , her dress torn . She's been raped by three young men on top of a pinball machine while a dozen others stand around and cheer . One young college student is appalled , however , and drops a dime on the others . Justice winds up being served . The obvious point of the movie is that not all rape victims need to be saints to deserve our sympathy . Jodie Foster plays a sluttish waitress who lives with some tattooed moron , drinks too much beer , and smokes dope . And after she cuts her own long blond hair in a spiky fashion , she looks like hell . On top of that , she's so ensconced in her working-class world that , when McGillis is driving her home from the hospital , she turns to the lawyer and asks in her croaking voice , " Did you go to college ? " College , for Foster's character , is as remote as the planet Neptune . Charges are brought against the three rapists and McGillis , at the insistence of her boss ( Carmen Argenziano ) , plea bargains them down to a guilty plea to reckless endangerment , not rape , because the boys don't want a sexual assault on their record . When Foster learns about this , she erupts with anger and accuses McGillis of selling her out . Foster wanted them convicted of rape , not reckless endangerment , although the sentences are identical . McGillis , fraught with guilt , decides to prosecute the onlookers for encouraging the crime by clapping , shouting , and offering encouragement . There follows a sharp argument with the D . A . who tells her to go ahead and throw her career away because , win or lose , McGillis is fired . The jury brings in a guilty verdict and three of the onlookers wind up in the slams . The strong performances bring out the weaknesses of the film , and they're simple flaws , easily avoided by a writer or director willing to challenge more than the rather mindless observation that some rape victims aren't perfect . All the men are bad and all the women are good , or at least well intentioned . The rapists are horrible of course . ( I've always wondered how a man who is drunk and stoned can beat a woman into submission and still achieve an erection , let alone maintain one . ) The onlookers , free to walk the streets , are remorseless . They follow the victimized Foster around . They taunt her and call her filthy names when they meet her in stores . They ridicule her and block her exit from the parking lot . They're ugly too . That's the second main point established by the movie - - men are beasts , from the loathsome rapists on up to the District Attorney - - and you can only trust another woman to jeopardize her own welfare for your sake . The message reeks of political correctness and is offensive to anyone of taste and perception . Life simply doesn't work that way and presenting reality so structured is a betrayal of art , although it would fit nicely into a Saturday morning children's cartoon . Granted , though , that the world might well be a better place if we could find some kind of antidote to all that testosterone . None of this vitiates the film's many virtues . Nice location shooting . And effective performances from everyone involved , including the men who are villains , pragmatists , and weaklings .
442687	819382	51622	6.0	Only Half a Man .	This is the original " The Fly . " I never did see David Cronenberg's remake except for a few snippets , but those snippets convinced me that Cronenberg was following his usual impulse to make the viewer's skin crawl . Some of us don't really need that . If we want our skins to crawl all we have to do is get out of bed in the morning . ( I'll except Cronenberg's " Dead Ringers " from those generalization , a truly spooky movie without a pander in it . ) As the original , this 1959 version stands tall . They actually seem to have intended to make a horror / science fiction movie rather than a comedy , and yet they've achieved both . It's a horrifying story of a Montreal scientist , Al Hedison , who invents a teleportation machine that deconstructs objects and sends their elements at the speed of light to a glass box where they are reassembled in their original form . Even the champagne retains its chill . There are , of course , always a few small problems to be ironed out . The printing on a cheap ash tray comes out backward . The pet cat , Dandelot , gets lost somewhere between the transmitter and the receiver . " Where is she now ? " asks the desperate wife , Patricia Owens . " Somewhere out in space . A stream of cat atoms , " Hedison replies wonderingly . The fact that Dandelot has been thoroughly disassembled doesn't stop her atomic stream from going MEOWWW as it sails off into the ether . ( I warned you this was funny . ) The general idea is that there are some things man was never meant to know . This used to be called hubris . The story of blundering into the unknown and coming up with unexpected consequences seems to have been especially common in the 19th century when theology was coming to grips with scientific breakthroughs like Darwinism . The theme had a resurgence in the SF movies of the 1950s , following the atomic bomb but " Frankenstein , or The Modern Prometheus " is still the holotype . The movie resonates with all sorts of familiar ideas and images . When Hedison's teleporter transmits the words " Made in Japan " backwards , he wordlessly walks away from his wife to sit at his desk and work on the problem . Just when they were planning a romantic evening together too . Hedison was never more than just half a man from the beginning . At any rate the scene reminded me of the opening of James Joyce's " Ulysses , " when the atheist Buck Mulligan mocks the Catholic mass by intoning ritualistic mumbo jumbo over his bowl of shaving cream , claiming he's transforming it into the body and blood of the Savior . Looking down puzzled at the untransformed shaving cream , he says , " Oops . A bit of trouble with those white corpuscles . " Hedison has the head and one arm of a fly , and the fly part is slowly fighting the rest of him for dominance . At one point he's trying to type a note to his wife with his human hand and the fly hand grasps the other's wrist and begins struggling with it , and all we can see is Dr . Strangelove and his gloved hand , which insists on saluting Hitler and strangling its owner . It is , however , a reasonably well-done , if not exactly expert , horror film . We want Hedison to get himself together again but his supporters can never seem to find that fly with the " white head . " At the end , after Hedison is safely cleaned and pressed , his brother ( Vincent Price ) and the skeptical police inspector ( Herbert Marshall ) stumble upon the fly with Hedison's head and arm . The " thing " is caught in a web and about to be eaten by a spider . " HELP ME ! HELP ME ! " it cries in a terrified yet comically tinny voice before Marshall comes unglued and smashes spider and fly with a rock . This scene , with Price and Marshall bent over , peering at the fly in the web , was subject to innumerable retakes because the two actors kept cracking up with laughter and ruining the shot . It really IS kind of funny .
442739	819382	107613	6.0	Familiarly Heartwarming .	Matt Dillon is a divorced , working-class New Yorker who pines to chip in with his buddies and buy a bowling alley . The thing holding him back is that he is disgorging money to his ex-wife Annabella Sciorra . Dillon is also hooked up with a nurse , Mary Louise Parker , while Sciorra has bonded with her professor William Hurt , who , lamentably , is married . I ask you - - the experienced movie-goer - - is it necessary to spell out what happens at the end ? Not if you've seen " The Awful Truth " or any of the innumerable others that wind up with the estranged couple realizing that they were really meant for each other all along . The only alternative , and it was fashionable for a while , was for the wounded wife to find empowerment in her singlehood , as in " Unmarried Woman . " The story was written by women and directed by a man , and so the perspective of both genders is rather neatly represented . The bits of symbolic interaction , the kind that women pick up and men blunder over , are nicely captured in the script . A little hackneyed here and there , as during Parker's dismissal of Dillon , but overall a nice job . The director adds an understanding of male companionship , of men stifled in their ability to express emotions other than lust and rage . And he knows how much men of Dillon's background treasure their Vettes . Here , the dialog is sometimes inept . A friend of Dillon's , Pope , is in love with a young woman named Marie . ( The central figures are all Italian ; the WASPS are on the periphery . ) " I doan know how I feel when I see Marie ! I mean , she might be 50 feet away . Maybe she's just brushin ' her hair or somethin ' . I mean , I doan know . My stomach gets dis HOLLOW feelin ' . I get all kinda JUMPY , if you know what I mean . " Well , I may or may not know what he means , but I know that working-class men DOAN TALK DIS WAY . Here's how the dialog would go . Dillon : " Hey , you still wit Marie or what ? " Pope : " Yeah . I tink it's getting ' deep . " If you take that verbal clumsiness away from these guys , you might as well take their cojones while you're at it . It was all pretty familiar , if intermittently amusing . Here's the thing that surprised me . Mary-Louise Parker's performance as Dillon's sometime girl friend who finally realizes that she can do better with somebody who cares more for her than for his ex wife or his car . She's quite good - - and in a slurpy and uninspiring part , too . No one wants to sound like a sexist but I'm compelled to point out , speaking to you as your psychologist , that men's and women's brains are rather different . That's not even to mention their hormones . I won't get into detail , but this biological difference is reflected in their interactional styles . I refer you to any of Deborah Tannen's books on the subject , as much as I hate to . ( She knows how to cut men off at the knees while retaining her deniability . ) Anyway , I think women would enjoy this film more than men . The men will squeeze some enjoyment out of what is likely to have been the director's contribution . I wish Mary-Louise Parker had been on screen more often , here and elsewhere , and not stuck in the victim role so repeatedly .
442716	819382	84805	6.0	Slickly commercial , and funny	Unemployed actor Dustin Hoffman poses as a woman , Dorothy Michaels , and lands a part on a soap opera where he falls for another cast member , Jessica Lange . Hoffman gets into the role and begins improvising snotty remarks and put-downs against his overbearing male costars , as well as coaching Lange on standing up for her rights instead of letting men walk all over her . Hoffman becomes the most popular person on the show and is irreplaceable . He's in hot water , however , since no one on the show realizes that he's a man , Lange included . ( The makeup is superb . ) Then things get all complicated . Lange's father , Charles Durning , develops a passion for Hoffman's Dorothy and offers him a ring . And Hoffman is locked into a contract that he can't get out of without inviting professional ruin . It's a very funny movie with clever gags that break little new ground in the transvestite genre . Example : After a friendly dinner , Lange confides to Dorothy that she , Lange , is tired of men hitting on her and fabulating compliments . It would be so much simpler , say Lange , is a man just came up to her , said , " I could lay a long line on you , but what I really want to say is that I find you very interesting and would like to make love to you . " Hoffman , as Dorothy , nods eagerly . Shortly afterward , in his male persona , he runs into Lange at a party . She of course doesn't recognize him without his Dorothy disguise . " You know something ? " , Hoffman asks . " I could lay a long line on you , but what I'd really like to say is that I find you very interesting and would like to make love to you . " Lange throws a glass of wine in his face and walks away . There are unusually good performances from Dustin Hoffman ( looking and acting convincingly feminine ) , Bill Murray , Sidney Pollack , and Jessica Lange in particular . I won't give away any more gags , I guess , though there are many amusing scenes . The chief problem with the movie is that it's structured for popular taste . It's burdened with a " meaningfulness " , namely the empowerment of women , that " Some Like It Hot " never dreamed of . And there are times when it's soft and cloying like the chocolate-covered cherries that someone gives Dorothy as a present . Lange and Hoffman are sharing a bed at Lange's family farm and the scene is loving and tender . A sappy love song swells in the background . It played under the end credits with a saxophone lead that sounds like Kenny G . And most of the comic situations are derivative too , as perforce they just about must be , because how many twists can be wrung out of a plot that has become this familiar . There isn't as much outright slapstick as in " Mrs . Doubtfire . " Nobody's bosom catches on fire . But there's the same quick-change problem when Hoffman's girl friend ( Terry Garr ) bursts into his apartment while he's still in costume . There's something else too . It's a little demeaning to women . I don't watch soap operas ( " afternoon dramas " ) , but I wonder if female characters are really treated as doormats . If they're called " Tootsie , " or " Doll , " or " Sweetie , " behind the camera , how terrible is that ? How different is it from calling a man " Pal " or " Mac " or " Buddy " ? And if it were true that women were subtly trashed behind and in front of the camera , does it really take a man in a woman's guise to wake them up ? The impression the film leaves with the viewer is that a good deal of thought and expense went into the production , but most of the effort was aimed not at making a good comedy but at appealing to the widest possible audience and raking in the shekels at the box office , at which I believe it succeeded .
442733	819382	75140	6.0	Stylized Murder Game .	At the very opening , we see a Swiss police officer stop beside a parked car on a hillside . The officer opens the door . There is a corpse inside with a bullet hole in his temple . So what does the policeman do ? Does he go back to his own car and radio headquarters to report a homicide ? Does the police force descend upon the crime scene , seal it off with tape to preserve its integrity , and examine the ground and take photos of the body ? No . No , the policeman gets into the dead man's car , starts it up , and drives into town with the corpse nodding beside him . A woman in a passing car is horrified by the sight of the bloody head , so the officer tries to perch his own police cap atop the corpse . The attempt is unsuccessful and the body jiggles and collapses against the dash . Now that's a weird opening for a murder mystery but then this film is something outré from beginning to end . The story , by the well-known Swiss author , Friedrich Durrenmatt , involves no more than the usual number of convolutions and winds up with a surprise ending . But the direction is by Max Schell , a highly underrated actor , who's done some enterprising work as a director too . He opts for a considerably stylized approach to the material . " I think I'm going to croak , " groans the police commissioner ( Martin Ritt , also an actor / director ) , sounding more like a man complaining of a hangover . " Well , I hope you feel better ! " chirps his assistant , John Voight , in a completely anomalous , cheery tone of voice . Ritt's commissioner really is ill and is schedule for an operation in a short while that may give him an extra year of life . A consequence of his illness is that he can't eat anything or drink any stimulating fluids . Throughout the film , maddeningly , others keep offering him schnapps or a piece of cake , all of which he must refuse until the reveal at the end , when he solves the case and , with gusto , stuffs himself full of soup , wurst , sauerkraut , and huge wedges of Emmentaler cheese . But , as I say , there are unexpected incidental touches in almost every scene . The initial corpse turns out to be that of another police officer . And we see perhaps two dozen people dressed in dark clothes standing around in the autumnal foliage while someone reads over the casket and a brass band plays a lament . But the threnody take on a subtle , more lively lilt . Soon , some of the mourners are tapping their feet . Then a row of four or five dark figures begin bobbing slightly up and down to the tune , by Ennio Moriconne out of Nino Rota . And that's nothing . An icy rain begins to fall . The mourners are quickly drenched and look as if they're about to freeze . And two more figures come literally dancing down the slope to drop a wreath on the coffin before dancing away . The wreath has the wrong name on it , but as it turns out , the cadaver was undercover and had two identities and whoever ordered the wreath got them mixed up . And so it goes . Sometimes Schell takes the story seriously . There are several shooting deaths . ( Only one of them is turned into a semi-joke . ) Jacqueline Bissett has the role of the girl who belongs to three men , the evil and egotistical villain Robert Shaw , the corpse , and John Voight's ever-smiling policeman . I can't figure out just what it is that informs Bissett's beauty , what it is that brings her so close to feminine perfection . Certainly her eyes have something to do with it . They slant at an ideal dihedral and they're sometimes blue , sometimes the color of a light turmeric . She has a generous bosom but I discount that . Martin Ritt is surprisingly effective as the worn-out , cynical , old cop . His features are over-sized , as are his black-rimmed glasses , and he has quadruple chins , smokes cigars , and his clothes are as shabby as his carefully cluttered apartment . Voight is good too , but then he always is . As a murder mystery , this is pretty sloppy work . As a thing unto itself , it's not at all bad . Madonna , it is always cold , foggy , and cloudy in Bern , hardly a healthy place to live . No wonder the commissioner is ill .
443223	819382	106856	7.0	What happens when you love not wisely but too well .	Above-average tale of a defense plant engineer ( Michael Douglas ) who loses everything - - his job , his car , his dignity , his temper , his wife , his daughter , his life . We first see him stuck in a Los Angeles traffic jam , bumper to bumper , sweating and fretting , until he walks away from his stalled car and begins to walk " home " - - that is , where his divorced wife ( Barbara Hershey ) and his young daughter live . Some home . ( Like that in the John Cheever short story , " The Swimmer , " it's a fantasy . ) As he trudges along in his white shirt , tie , and unhip eyeglasses , he pauses from time to time to phone his wife and tell her he's on his way , because it's his daughter's birthday . " I know it's Adel's birthday - - what do you want ? " , she tells him , adding , " I'll call the police if I have to . " She doesn't seem to want him around and his daughter seems completely indifferent . Meanwhile , Douglas runs into all kinds of obstacles . A street-wise Korean shopkeeper wants to charge him eighty-five cents for a can of Coke ( a big laugh , as of this date ) and Douglas blows his cork , smashing some merchandise and walking off with the owner's sawed-off baseball bat . Things get worse . He crosses paths with some cholos who demand his money and produce a weapon that , when I was a teenager , was widely known as a " Portugese " knife . But he clobbers them with his bat and , later , winds up with a gym bag full of their pistols and automatic weapons . The confrontations continue and the police , represented by Robert Duvall and Rachel Ticotin , finally get wise to him and track him to the Santa Monica pier where he is more or less holding his wife and child hostage . When Duvall tries to place him under arrest , Douglas asks wonderingly , " I'm the bad guy ? " Whatever other things he's lost , self-justification isn't one of them . From what I'd heard , I hadn't expected much of this film - - another revenge story , along the lines of " Death Wish " . But it's actually fairly complex , despite some clumsy moment and many implausibilities . The film's chief weakness is that , though Douglas is clearly around the bend , everybody who gets a taste of his anger somehow has asked for it . The offense can be major - - trying to gun him down on the street - - or minor - - refusing to serve him from the breakfast menu at a burger joint after eleven thirty . And I don't know if the writer , Ebbe Rowe Smith , intended it this way but both Douglas's ex-wife and Duvall's current wife , played by Tuesday Weld , are both bitches in their different ways . When Douglas has called to say he's on his way home , despite the restraining order , Hershey calls the police and informs them that he has " a tendency towards violence . " ( He pounded on the door after midnight . ) The police ask her if he struck his daughter . No . " Did he - - strike you ? " " Not exactly . I didn't want to wait until he got around to it . He COULD - - I think . " The cop nods knowingly and makes a note . Abusive husband . That's a cheap , stereotypical shot . Douglas has a restraining order against him because he's suspected of perhaps some day possibly committing a violent act within his family . Kind of a unilateral preemptive move on Hershey's part . Duvall's wife , Tuesday Weld , is also a thoroughly formulaic figure - - whining , narcissistic , demanding , hypochondriacal , the clear wearer of the pants in the family . The two wives may be manipulative but Duvall's partner , Rachel Ticotin , comes off as an admirable figure . Not dazzlingly gorgeous , she nevertheless has good , strong features arranged in an uncontrived manner . And she gives a good performance . So does Lois Smith in the small part of Douglas ' uncomprehending mother . Douglas himself can't be considered a wildly expressive performer but he successfully suggests the kind of pressure one might find behind a zit that's about to pop . Robert Duvall has given some magisterial performances early in his career - - MASH and The Godfather among them - - but here rather walks through the part with a lot of pointless or possibly ironic chuckles . Weaknesses aside , Douglas's character is complicated enough to grip us and the milieu of Los Angeles is captured in all its local color , which varies from indifference to outrage .
443331	819382	26174	7.0	Up into the shrouds , Lads !	It's Flynn's first big picture and it brings him together with Olivia DeHavilland , Michael Curtiz , and Erich Wolfgang Korngold . It's not their best movie together but it's a terrific introduction to the parts these personalities were to play in swashbucklers . Flynn is brash and cocky . ( He didn't change much until he began to physically deteriorate later in life . ) He projects his emotions the way a traffic light projects directions , with utter simplicity . There's never a moment when we doubt we know what he's thinking . He looks extremely handsome too ( he was 26 ) without being in the least effete . Olivia De Havilland is his perfect counterpart . She was never a raving beauty , but she's extremely feminine . She has a wide face with huge eyes , a dazzling smile , and a tinkling laugh . Where Flynn is adventurous she is cautious , thoughtful , often puzzled about her loyalties , and she holds things back , while Flynn shouts things out . The rest of the cast is filled with familiar faces from the 30s - - J . Carol Naish , Guy Kibbee , Lionel Atwill - - and they do their jobs well . It's a sound-stage bound movie with a lot of model work , some of it clumsy but still effective . A neatly done set is a tribute to the production designer . The banana plants grow neatly in picturesque places and the papier-mache palms beat the real thing . Natural locations are often cluttered with vegetation , but these jungles and beaches are flawless . They don't look like real locations . They look like what you wish real locations looked like . This is Erich Wolfgang Korngold's first score for a movie . ( He'd previously adapted Mendelsohn for an earlier one . ) It's often claimed that Hollywood composers were child prodigies but in Korngold's case it's not an exaggeration . He was studying piano and music theory at five , conducted his own cantata ( for Gustav Mahler ) at nine , and had his first work published at thirteen . He was a prolific composer too - - violin concertos , two operas - - by the time he was in his mid-thirties . Max Reinhardt sent him to Hollywood to write a few scores , of which this was one . It was thrown into his lap and he had to write it almost overnight . There was simply not enough time to do it all , so he stole a little from Liszt , the scene in which the Spanish pirates are looting the town . He returned to Europe to continue his career but , well , the continent by that time was no place for a guy named Korngold , genius or not . So he returned to Hollywood until after the war when he was able to go back to Europe and renew his composing . I don't mean to take up too much space dealing with Korngold , but the fact is that Flynn's early movies would just not be the same with anyone else . Korngold wrote music the way Flynn acted - - full of dash and bombast - - and some of it was stunningly lyrical . ( The simple love song in " The Sea Hawk " has a melodic progression that defies prediction . ) It's hardly worth noting that the name of this talented musician has been parodied elsewhere as " Wolfgang von Korngold " by another reviewer , Howydymax , whose penetrating insights into film fare I have usually admired and sometimes stolen from . Curtiz's direction had the same slam-bang quality as the composer's . Absolutely nothing artsy about it , a straightforward story . There are some weaknesses in the script . When I first saw it , finally , on TV , I'd been waiting for a chance for years and was frustrated because there didn't seem to be enough action . One longish scene of sailing ships pounding each other to pieces , and one fencing match between Basil Rathbone and Flynn - - too brief for my taste . Actually , at the time Flynn wasn't comfortable with swordplay and it shows . Rathbone , on the other hand , took up the sport seriously and was evidently a pretty accomplished fencer . I've seen it again recently and enjoyed it much more , a cartoon of a movie , full of intrigue , romance , and action . Well worth watching .
442128	819382	75866	7.0	Pretty Good Later Entry .	This is the one in which the diminutive Ruth Gordon plays an Agatha-Christie type of murder mystery author who locks her nephew by marriage into a safe . Gordon believes that he murdered her niece and the young fellow dies of suffocation , while Gordon is traveling back and forth to New York . He manages , however , to leave behind some clues , scratches on a couple of black safe deposit boxes and an improvised and well-hidden note . Columbo enters the case , suspects her at once , and solves the mystery by simply using his supernatural mystical intuitive powers . Oh , and Mariette Hartley is on hand as Gordon's secretary and would-be blackmailer . Hartley is , I believe , the grand daughter of the psychologist B . F . Skinner . I'm not sure her ancestry had anything to do with her attractive belly button , which is on display during a belly dance sequence , but I've always admired Skinner anyway . The murder is well handled . It's a good plot , and none of the performers or crew fluff anything . But the outstanding figure here is Ruth Gordon , only a skosh over five feet tall . She was over 80 years old and looked it . There are moments when she almost teeters , but she consistently exudes charm . Her acting is idiosyncratic . You can never be sure when she's being serious or when she's putting Columbo and the audience on . She's given some good lines too . What humor there is comes from Gordon . Columbo doesn't have any of his frequent comic moments . All in all , a nice job by everyone concerned .
442115	819382	37101	7.0	Snappy Detective Yarn .	With this movie , Dick Powell switched his image from faded musical star to tough guy , and he's pretty good . He's nasal and cynical and sure of himself as he works his way , as Philip Marlowe , through a world of suave villains ( Otto Krueger ) , gigantic and rebarbative clients ( Mike Mazurki ) , blond seductresses ( Clair Trevor ) , and other assorted Chandleresque types . Actually , Raymond Chandler's novel , " Farewell , My Lovely " , is followed about as closely as the agents of social control would allow in 1944 . Edward Dmytryk's direction is efficient and the black-and-white photography , along with the special effects , are well done for their time . Of course , we get Dick Powell's narration of Chandler's prose with its curious tropes . We HAVE to get Chandler's prose because what else is there ? A PLOT ? Five minutes into the film and already Marlowe is working on two separate cases with two separate casts , one having to do with stolen jade , the other with Velma Galento . The threads come together late but it would take the devotion of a Talmudic scholar to figure out all the meanders of this torturous story . No , the key to enjoyment of the film rests with the acting - - from one disjointed incident to the next - - and the recherché charm of the narration . ( " I only took the case because my bank account was trying to crawl under a duck's belly . " ) The movie , like the prose that guides us through it , is inelegant and pretty literal . When somebody hits Marlowe over the head with a sap , the narration tells us that " a big black hole opened up in front of me . I dived in . It had no bottom . " And the screen shows us a big black hole opening up in front of him . He dives in . It has no bottom . It's a good film and enjoyable from beginning to end , once you blind yourself to its limitations . I prefer the 1975 remake with Robert Mitchum . The features that are good in this movie are improved upon in the later version . The photography here is just fine . The photography in 1975 was magnificent . And Powell is a good Marlowe , tough and confident , but Mitchum brings something unique to the role . Mitchum isn't stereotypically hard boiled like Powell . He slouches with exhaustion . ( And that's acting , not Mitchum's natural state , because in Mitchum's remake of " The Big Sleep , " a year or two later , he was speedier and carried the momentum of a bull dozer . ) And Mitchum brings more nuance to the role . Watch the scene in which he's slapped hard by the whorehouse Madam , gapes at her for a second , then lets out a feral yell , leaps to his feet and belts her in the mouth . Powell , satisfying as he is , doesn't have that kind of range . This one has everything that a thoroughly coagulated detective story ought to have . Great scene , when Powell tries to shrug off the effects of the drug he's been given and finds himself surrounded by smoke and spider webs . He tries to threaten the placid doctor who has shot him full of joy juice : " I've got a GUN . When people with a gun tell you to do something , you're supposed to do it ! " He sounds frazzled , confused and a little saddened because the conventions of the detective genre aren't working for him . See it , you big lug , or I turn your face into a dish of moo goo gai pan .
443008	819382	457430	7.0	Dorothy on a Drastic Bummer .	The film had enough hype behind it that I settled in to watch it . In the first ten minutes I was considering watching an Agatha Christie mystery instead . At the end of fifteen minutes it had me and I couldn't get away . Ofelia , who should know better at fourteen , has childhood fantasies about fairies and fauns and monsters and magic cures . She lives in Spain in 1944 . Her mother is having a troubled pregnancy and her stepfather is a sadistic murdering brute who represents General Franco . There a lot of special effects in the first ten minutes or so . A fairy visits her and beckons her into a labyrinth , at the bottom of which is a faun who gives her three scary tasks . She completes the first one okay - - feeding stones to a giant toad . She flunks the second , but , given a last chance , she succeeds at the third , which means giving her life for the life of her infant brother . She ascends into heaven and sitteth at the right hand of her long-gone real father , and the left hand of her newly deceased mother . What turned me off were those special effects . First of all , the fairy that visits her in her bedroom , the first time , is not my idea of a fairy . The fairy starts of fluttering around the room and making an ominous crackling sound . The first time Ofelia sees it , it looks like a cross between a stick insect and a praying mantis . I don't know if the producers intended it that way but the thing made my skin crawl . Ditto for the " faun . " This is the least pettable faun in your collective unconscious . A stone statue creaks into life and turns into this hideous , demonic creature with monster ram horns , a thoroughly screwed up face , long pointy fingernails , hooves and whatnot . It speaks in a slow raspy voice that sounds as if it's lying with every phoneme . If that's the best fantasy she can come up with , she needs to get into Deepak Chopra or something . Gave me the willies . At that , it may be an improvement over the real world she lives in , a story that saves the film in my estimation . All these Spanish folks are just trying to get along , see , except for Franco's soldiers , of which Ofelia's stepfather is one . He has a nasty habit of going around shooting people , including , in the end , the young girl . He does it without passion , without remorse , even when the victims turn out to be innocent . Sometimes , I guess out of boredom , he allows a doomed prisoner to try brushing away the muzzle a few times before he finally pulls the trigger . On the other side are the communist peasants who live in the hills . They're the good guys and see to it that the stepfather pays for his sins . The special effects were overdone . It's as if they'd been designed by somebody on shrooms . Many of the fantasy creatures are covered with the glutinous substance that sticks to everything , and the sound people have made it sound as if someone is stirring a pot of molasses with a wooden spoon . It would have been a better film if the effects had been turned down a little bit . They seem intended to dazzle rather than convince , but the only people who will be dazzled would be children who haven't played video games or watched crummy monster movies . The effects are even overdone during the real-life story , as when the stepfather sews up his own slashed cheek . He didn't need to do that . First , he could have called the company medic who would have done a better job . Second , we've already witnessed this scene when Arnold Schwarzenegger plucks out his own eyeball in " The Terminator . " It's not shocking . It's self indulgent . But , the CGI aside , it's an innovative movie . There have been other Spanish films about kids ' fantasies ( " The Spirit of the Hive " ) but this one is livelier and truly gripping . A person who has just been shot isn't yanked backwards like a marionette , the cliché treatment . He may hardly notice it at first , pause to remove his glasses , before slumping . The director will sometimes cut while a foreground object , such as a tree trunk , interrupts the flow of the images . And more than once there are other people witnessing a scene but they are hidden from us until someone waves aside the obscuring object , which may be an open umbrella . The shocks are effective and more subtle than anything in the fantasies . The movie really does resemble " The Wizard of Oz " played as tragedy . We even get a pair of Ofelia's red shoes . The ending , of course , is a cop out unless you can believe , as some do , that fantasy life continues after we expire . And the good peasants didn't win , as they seem to in the movie . Instead , Franco lived on to a ripe old age and the baton was passed to his son . The film will break your heart , but it's a nice fantasy .
443567	819382	63094	7.0	Deliberate Comedy Rewards Patience .	It's about an embezzler , Peter Ustinov , who infiltrates a British company , Texa-Conn or something like that , posing as a computer whiz and security expert . He secretly learns to hack into the computer , while gathering the admiration of his boss , Karl Malden , the enmity of his office rival , Bob Newhart , and the love of his inept secretary , Maggie Smith . Some of the business details were a little murky to these non-business-oriented eyes but they're believable enough and I got the general idea . Ustinov , the peculating Peter , establishes phony businesses in Paris , Rome , and Stuttgart , and uses Texa-Conn's computer to send all kinds of money to these ersatz establishments . The overseas companies , of course , consist of nothing more than himself , Ustinov , and the addresses are an abandoned artist's loft in Paris , a barber shop in Rome , and a bakery in Germany . He simply visits them to collect the checks he's sent himself . I didn't think I'd like it for the first few minutes because it seemed rather on the slow side . I was expecting something with a faster tempo and more outrage , along the lines of " The Pink Panther " or " The Lavender Hill Gang . " But this film insinuates itself into your good graces as you come to appreciate the understated humor in the plot , the characterizations , and the dialog . Probably it would be a bad idea to give away too many of the relatively subtle gags but here are some examples of the more noticeable . Ustinov to Secretary Smith : " Let me have the assets of these companies . " Smith : " Assets ? What are they ? " Ustinov : " Little female donkeys . " Now , nothing is made of this little exchange . There's a quick cut and no delay for any laughter , which is appropriate because one's reaction is more likely to be a smile than a laugh . Ustinov searches out that crummy loft in Paris . It's covered with cobwebs . Bricks are strewn around and a couple of the former occupant's paintings have been left behind . The landlord doesn't speak English and Ustinov knows no French . Ustinov points to a child-like painting of a nude woman and chuckles , " Ah . A fam fye-tal , eh ? " Landlord chuckles too , replies : " Vous le prenez pour une anee ? " Ustinov : " Oh - - ANNIE , so that's her name ! " Landlord : " Oui ? " Ustinov : " Entente cordiale ! " ( Mes amis , if I got those genders wrong , je m'excuse . ) Bob Newhart as Willard Gnatpole ( ! ) has the hots for Maggie Smith and is supposed to be driving her home but tells her he's taking " the scenic route . " There is an immediate sequence of suggestive traffic signs . " Caution . " " Lay-By . " " Give Way . " " Yield . " Ending with the imperious " STOP / CHILDREN . " There's another montage when Ustinov's scheme is about to be discovered by the board of directors - - blurry rooftops , police cars , a farewell embrace from Maggie , ending with a sign : PRISON , Wormwood Scrubs . Well , maybe one more . I still can't get over Malden as the boss , declaring decisively , " I never agonize over decisions , " then gulping a handful of pills and washing them down with a glass of water . The acting is unarguably fine . It's Bob Newhart's best role , for instance . Not that he had that many , and not that his range wasn't limited , but he's perfect in this part . The musical score by Laurie Johnson obviously had a good deal of effort put into it . She seems to have written a brief concerto for flute . Ustinov's passion is music and his overseas establishments are headed by false names like Claude Debussy and Giacconino Rossini . Stuttgart's phony president is somebody named Schmidt , and he's an anomalous clinker . Maggi Smith is pretty , sexy , bourgeois , and turns out to be not nearly so dumb as she seems . Delightful , in its own quiet way , but don't expect comic fireworks .
441702	819382	854678	7.0	Cool Hand Dilawar .	Anybody see " Cool Hand Luke " ( 1967 ) with Paul Newman as an inmate at a small southern prison camp ? That's the one in which a guard tells Luke , " You got to get your mind right . " A gripping movie , comic and then tragic . The guards , led by the pock-faced " man with no eyes " , are real mean mothers . For infractions of the rules or any sassy backtalk , they lock Luke up in " the box " , an upright wooden shelter the size of a one-hole outhouse , with only a pail for company . He's held there in the blistering heat for 24 hours . When Luke gets more uppity they simply beat hell out of him . Well , all of that is peanuts compared to what went on in our detainee camps at Bagram , Abu Ghraib , and Gitmo - - not to mention the CIA-maintained black holes in countries known around the world for their humane treatment of prisoners , such as Egypt and Bulgaria . The detainees at Bagram and Abu Ghraib - - only 10 percent of whom were picked up by coalition forces , the rest being turned over to us by Afghanis or Pakinstanis , sometimes for bounty - - were not subject to any questioning before being thrown into solitary confinement and held there not for 24 hours , like Luke , but for weeks . They were shackled to the ceiling , forced to assume stress positions , beaten on the legs , waterboarded and forced to undergo many of the other horrors we associate with the Inquisition . But that's an old story by now . This film doesn't really tell us much that we hadn't known or guessed , except that it was worse than we imagined . It begins and ends with the case of Dilawar , a taxi driver who left his family to drive to the provincial capitol and show off his new car and wound up in Bagram where he was killed - - one of 37 homicides so far acknowledged by the US Army . His legs were " pulpified " according to the Army's medical examiner . There are three fundamental issues involved in the application of enhanced interrogation techniques . ( 1 ) Do they work ? ( 2 ) Are they moral ? ( 3 ) Are they legal ? " Taxi to the Dark Side " , for most of its length , seems to focus on the first question . Does torture work ? Well , no it doesn't . That is to say , it's worthless if your goal is to get accurate information out of your subjects . But it may be well worthwhile if your aim to exact revenge upon people who look like the lunatics who flew airplanes into the WTC in 2001 , people who speak the same language and come from the same area , the Middle East . Boy , are those Middle East folks alien to us . The language sounds like they're clearing their throats . They wear tablecloths on their heads . They dream of 72 virgins in Paradise . If you want revenge , these are your targets alright . I doubt that one out of a hundred Americans could walk up to a blank map on the wall and put his finger on Afghanistan , Iraq , Iran , Pakistan , and Syria . We don't know anything about geography but we know what we don't like . The enlisted men who were tried for some of the crimes and interviewed for this film wouldn't say exactly that . For those who were willing to talk about it , they claim that their orders were vague . No officer was ever charged , while the enlisted men wound up with prison terms and BCDs . Also not spoken about - - probably because nobody knows about it - - are the taken-for-granted assumptions about relationships between guards and prisoners . It's all very well for us , sitting at home in our Naugahide recliners , to feel angry at the way the untrained and ill-led MPs performed but , as one of them says , " Try going over there and saying that . " He's right . It has to do with role playing . It's not my opinion . It's established experimental fact . I refer anyone interested to Philip Zimbardo's famous " prison experiment " in the 1950s . It's probably available on Google . Well , you might ask , does anyone come out of this perfectly serious description of perfectly despicable acts looking good ? Yes , in fact . The representative of the FBI argues persuasively that his agency was able to step out of the box and recognize what was happening . And a couple of politicians , like John McCain , coming late to the game expressed their disapproval in public . One is tempted to compare it to Errol Morris's " Standard Operating Procedure " but they're different movies with different ends in mind . Morris avoids easy judgments and asks in his usual philosophical way what the photos from Abu Ghraib " mean " . This film is more interested in demonstrating what went on in the prison . I expected it to be an abusive moral diatribe but it turned out to be pretty instructive . We all know about the mistreatment , but I , at least , had never understood how endemic and intense it was . I give Gibney credit for not taking the easy route of bashing the suits in Washington more than they deserve , for not making fools of them more than they've done themselves . Only once , during a guided tour of Guantanamo Bay , does he turn sarcastic . As the cheerful guide ( it's like a tour of Universal Studios ) shows us the neat little cells with the neatly made bed and the comfortable slippers and the box of checkers on the night table , the pop tune " My Little Corner of the World " plays in the background - - ancient and mindless , kind of like torture . A depressing movie underneath it all .
443307	819382	63442	7.0	Man See , Man Do .	Charlton Heston is the only survivor of a space expedition that has crashed on a planet some millions of light years from earth , and thus some 2 , 000 years in the future . He stumbles into a rude civilization in which apes rule , while the tribes of speechless humans are treated as wild animals and periodically rounded up for experimentation or extermination . Heston is wounded in the throat during his capture and is rendered mute like the others . Since he demonstrates signs of intelligence , he is singled out for behavioral examination and kept in a cage with a female of the species . The apes argue over whether he actually has brains or is simply aping his betters . When he regains his speech , it upsets everyone's view of life as it should be , as it's written down in the " scrolls " by the " law giver . " His chief enemy is an orang-utan played by Maurice Evans . With the help of two enlightened scientific chimpanzees , Kim Hunter and Roddy MacDowell , he manages to escape with his Significant Other , only to discover that he has landed back on earth , whence he came , but that a war has destroyed humankind and left an ecological vacuum that has been filled by the great apes . Actually , the movie runs along three parallel tracks . One is the unraveling of the mystery of how the apes came to be superior to humans , and the moral behind the puzzle . A second involves the internal dissent among the apes , pitting those who scoff at the idea of man and culture , and those who believe Heston and want to see him saved and set free . The third is a running commentary on Western culture circa 1967 , the era of flower power and hippies and rebellious youth and disgruntled , resentful elders clinging to old concepts . I discount the relationship between Heston and the young lady , since she doesn't speak and was in real life the mistress of the producer , Richard Zanuck . It all may seem a little preachy now , and in some respects incomprehensible to those who don't remember the tumultuous 1960s . The morphed wisecracks are still amusing though . " Don't trust anyone over thirty . " Will the youngsters get that ? Will they get Maurice Evans ' speech before the Council of Three , which alludes twice to the Declaration of Independence and once each to Alexander Pope and George Orwell ? Probably not . The apes seem to be getting righter all the time . There are other instructive evocations of current social dynamics . On Planet Ape , the lighter you are , the better off you are . The buff orang-utans are the aristocratic leaders . The grayish chimpanzees are their middle-class intellectuals and technicians , rather like today's nerds . The black gorillas are the grunts . They do all the wet work . They're the guards and the police force and the flunkies and the shoe-shine boys . An interesting remark by Heston in a commentary on the film : the three simian strata subjected themselves to voluntary segregation . The separate species hung out together , ate lunch together , and though they showed no evident hostility towards the others , they clearly preferred their own kind . Is this movie telling us more than we need or want to know ? Shouldn't a sociologist find this as disturbing as Heston finds the wreck of the Statue of Liberty ? Except for Charlton Heston , there's no acting worth commenting on . The others are buried in carefully designed make up . They can only project the most rudimentary expressions - - a slight frown , a weak smile - - and their voices could have easily been dubbed . Every actor , down to the extras , underwent this lengthy and elaborate disguise . Later versions of the tale , as the concept became degraded and decadent , saved time and money by giving the lesser performers simple rubber masks . They probably could have lowered the budget on this initial entry by using cheaper techniques . Few people would have noticed , and , really , the story is determinedly middle-brow , like Rod Serling's simple sermons on the excellent " The Twilight Zone " series . Not particularly subtle or challenging , the story is what might be called " thought provoking . " It made scads of money , which accounts for the many sequels and the recent remake . If there's a nickel left to be made out of the franchise we can expect another one any minute . Yet it's an enjoyable movie - - amusing and , well , though provoking . Nice location shooting and imaginative art direction . See it with the kids . Explain to them that " we hold these truths to be self evident " is from a charter document , that Pope said " the proper study of mankind is man , " and that Orwell wrote " some are more equal than others . " They'll thank you for it and , with any luck , will climb down from the chandelier .
442030	819382	312549	7.0	What's worth dying for ?	Two indisputable things to be learned from this film : ( 1 ) Ireland does not look like it does in " The Quiet Man " and ( 2 ) Cate Blanchett has got to be one of the finest actresses around . Dublin here resembles any large American city , with wealthy drug lords cashing in at the top , a horde of distributing goons near the bottom , and junkies on the streets , sometimes dead . Cate Blanchett is the real Veronica Guerin , a journalist who probed too far into this subterranean system . She writes a series of articles on drug use and the vermin involved , substituting their eke names for their real ones , so she and her paper can't be sued . A ninety-caliber dealer becomes " The Monk , " for instance . The legal system is so arranged that the police have difficulty dealing with the problem and the government is able to investigate only an individual's assets for tax purposes , not the source of those assets . Thus , you can be a bus boy in a louche restaurant and no one will question it when you file a tax return for a million pounds . Blanchett first encounters the usual deaf-and-dumb routine from her sources , then as she continues to gather data and publish them , warnings , then threats , then she is shot through the thigh , then pistol whipped , and finally shot dead . It's astounding , the way Blanchett handles this character . She laughs off the threats from both her editors and friends and from the people she's exposing . Of course it's easy for an actor to laugh , but Blanchett laughs NERVOUSLY and gives us a glimpse of the terror behind the bravado . Not only that , but she acts SO nonchalantly in the face of danger to herself , her friends , and her family that she's able to suggest something resembling a death wish . The story itself evidently made history in Ireland , and the requisite happy epilogue follows Guerin's murder . A special investigative board is created to prosecute heroin dealers and the law is changed so that assets may now be frozen . Some of the bad guys wind up in the slams , some on the lam . The script has its felicities . Blanchett remarks to her editor that she now has the name of the kingpin and the editor replies , " Yes , but you can't prove it . " Blanchett : " This is as bad as the police force . " Editor : " Worse . We don't have the resources or the power to arrest . " ( Something like that . ) At it's bottom , though , the plot fits rather neatly into what seems to have become a genre unto itself - - brave , resourceful , tough-talking babe pushes her way into an expose of corruption and crime . And neglects her family to carry on with her bliss . I'll just mention " Erin Brokovitch " in passing as another example . There are many others . But I suppose there's only so much you can do with a story like this , based as it is on true events . Guerin's death was a noble tragedy by any measure , yet it prompts certain ontic questions . How much in the way of " good " must be at stake to be worth dying for ? Would any normal person die in order to put away a handful of gangsters and to make drug laws more effective ? I suspect that after the pistol whipping , most of us would have started a new series of newspaper articles about the social significance of different hair styles . But Veronica Guerin was different . Watching this story play out is like watching a Greek tragedy . Ennobling maybe , but pretty depressing too .
441887	819382	105236	7.0	A True Original	SPOILERS . There's no doubt about Quentin Tarentino's inventiveness . This was a real shocker when I first saw it several years ago . There had been violence before , but never so inexplicable . And gore before , but never gore quite so galore before . And that odd , quirky dialog - - alternately clumsy and adroit . It was obviously done on a small budget but did everything it was supposed to do and more . A second viewing , along with some knowledge of Tarrentino's later work , deprives us of the shock but gives us a better perspective on the movie . A couple of things stand out . One is that Tarrentino is like Howard Hawks in depriving his characters of any background . ( That's about all he and Hawks have in common . ) There have rarely been such rootless people wandering around on the screen . In this instance , there is a father / son pair , but nobody else has any family , few real friendships except those developed in the course of the narrative . There is no ethnic solidarity . Nobody has a home or a dog . Nobody has a job . Nobody has a girlfriend . These characters are like the ones Shakespeare warned us about , coming out of " air , thin air . " Another thing is the catholic derivativeness of the story and the scenes . Tarrentino may have made an art movie here but he's gobbled up bits and pieces of every kind of film imaginable , from superior stuff to schlock . The claustrophobic feeling of being cooped up in a warehouse with people you don't know and can't trust , he claims , was borrowed from Carpenter's junk version of " The Thing . " The moment when everyone is pointing guns at everyone else , waiting for someone to fire first , seems to be from the climactic scene of " The Wild Bunch . " The exclusive use of pop rock in the score has been done by Scorcese and others . But it's hard to be sure that these are borrowings because , to the extent they are , such borrowings have never seen in such multitudes and so nicely fitted together . The big shootout , of the sort we saw in such detail in " Heat , " is mostly off screen here , which saves money and doesn't cost the narrative much since it deals mainly with character and motivation and blood . The violence and the blood that follows can be a problem . The focus isn't on suffering , just pain and fear . People bleed enough to fill a bath tub . And that scene in which the bound cop is mutilated by Michael Madsen is a bit too-well set up and executed - - for me , anyway . And this is despite the fact that we don't know the cop , or any of the other characters really . These scenes are just shivers looking for spines to run up . Grown sadists and kids who don't know anxiety may enjoy it more . Interesting anecdote . In an interview , Tarrentino describes how poor Lawrence Tierney was giving his big speech assigning the names of colors to the robbers - - " Mr . Orange , Mr . Pink " , and so on . ( Borrowed from " The Taking of Pelham One Two Three . " ) Tierney kept forgetting his lines or blowing them and asking to start again from the top . The other actors were required to sit off screen without moving or changing expression . It took two hours for a satisfactory take . All of the other performers who had been sitting like stone idols all that time went suddenly into spasms of twitching , yawning , scratching , and moaning with relief .
443386	819382	382765	7.0	Slow , engrossing community drama .	I'm not ordinarily given to slow , moody movies unless they're well done . This one is pretty well done , especially considering its slender plot . The Australians have done this before , with " The Last Wave " ( which came out of the cinematic hinterland ) , " Picnic at Hanging Rock " , and " Lantana . " That's a lot of portentous silence . Curiously , the tonus of these films is at odds with Australian character . You have to love the Aussies . They kind of surf along the cultural currents without causing much trouble . They call each other " Mate , " they love beer , they're big on sports , and they avoid dwelling on the unfathomable . Well , Rupert Murdoch is an exception . He's a serious guy . ( I really enjoy these Olympian generalizations . ) Four guys go on an overnight fishing trip near Canberra . One of them is Gabriel Byrne , an Irishman who isn't getting along all that smoothly with his American wife , Laura Linney . When the men reach their fishing spot they find a dead body in the river . There's no mystery about who did it . We find that out in the first minutes . But the men - - well , what can you do ? The young black woman is beyond help . Is she enough reason to abort the holiday ? Nope . They tether the body to a tree and spend the day and night fishing and drinking . The next day they go back , report the finding , and are contumed by their community , not to mention the local black folk . A black woman asks , " What would you have done if it had been a white girl ? " And one of the wives , Laura Linney , asks what Byrne would have done had it been a boy instead of a girl ? The men and their wives would just as soon forget it and get on with things , except for Laura Linney , who is physically ill , perhaps with some psychosomatic disorder . There are times when she's so angry with her husband , and so ridden with guilt , that she seems unbalanced . In the end , she levers the community into contributing enough money to pay for the girl's funeral , and - - implausibly - - uses her moral puissance to get the men and their wives to attend the services . At the service , Byrne approaches the girl's father and apologizes for the way he treated the body . The father throws dirt on Byrne , spits , and turns away . Well , what are you going to do ? The men may not have broken any laws by ignoring the body but they certainly are guilty of inhumane behavior . Having committed a sin , they took their licking and must then keep on ticking , like Marlon Brando in " On The Waterfront . " Insensibly , with the passage of time , breaches like this are absorbed by the community and , if they never are entirely forgotten , they become historical and lose much of their emotional charge . The fact that the press and the other members of the town shun them is part of their penance , the price they pay , and it's just . " Gossip " is a bad word , but community sentiment is an important means of social control . It's foolish to believe that it is the police alone who keep order in the community . Community sentiment is like water in that , while too much of it , uncontrolled , can be dangerous , it's also necessary for public order . The photography is marvelous . Canberra and environs aren't picture-postcard pretty - - but they are picturesque . The film ends on a love song , written by the dead girl and sung by her friend at the funeral service . I began to wince because the singer wasn't entirely terrible . But , thank you , Lord , it wasn't a slow , tragic song with mystic , aboriginal overtones - - just an ordinary vernacular ballad . And the singer chokes up just before she finishes it . She loses it just enough . A few seconds either way would have drained the incident of much of its impact . Those four fisherman , of course , were stupid and insensitive . But it's not easy to feel TOO superior to them , at least not for those of us who have made serious mistakes in our lives that have hurt other people needlessly . At one point , Laura Linney has collected enough to cover the funeral expenses , visits the black family of the dead girl , and offers the box of money to the girl's sister . " It's not charity , " says Linney . The black woman replies sarcastically , " Oh ? You buyin ' something then ? " She certainly is .
441674	819382	52365	7.0	Thumping Historical Adventure .	Stunning photography of the Norwegian fjords by Jack Cardiff , only one of the enjoyable features of this action movie . Ernest Borgnine is Ragnar a ( literally ) rapacious Viking . The Vikings , as we all know , were given to pillaging - - which is almost as fun as raping - - along the coastal settlements of England , which , in 850 AD or so , was divided into many petty kingdoms . ( Sorry for the AD but , however non-PC , it seems correct to the period . ) Ragnar is proud of his lusty son , Einar ( Kirk Douglas ) , here more gloriously blond than ever . The Viking community is made up of happy people who ride ponies , raise sheep , make stuff out of wood , and sail the seas . They really got around , too . They not only carved permanent settlements out of Northumbria and parts of Northwestern England , but they settled in Brittany , Iceland , and probably the northeastern coast of North America - - most likely pillaging and raping wherever they went . A dark and sullen slave , Erik ( Tony Curtis ) , is a member of their Norwegian settlement too . He happens to be an illegitimate son of Ragnar but nobody finds out about it until the end and , really , it makes little difference to the plot . Janet Leigh is the blond Welsh woman who give Einar and Erik someone to fight over . Richard Fleischer was the director . He and his staff evidently put a good deal of time and effort into researching the period details . They certainly LOOK right . Those clinker-built sailing ships are as graceful as swans . The exteriors look right , and the interiors are inviting - - if you're the kind of pervert who enjoys drinking , fighting , carousing , laughing , stomping on table tops , and chopping the pigtails off the heads of unfaithful wives . I wish Fleischer had looked a little more closely at the hair styles of the original Viking women , though . These all look like Beatniks or students of Martha Graham , the doyen of modern dance . All the performances are at least adequate . Douglas has a flashier role than Curtis . He stumbles around kicking food off table tops when drunk , and looks real menacing when garbed for war . He did most of his own stunts too . I wouldn't want to play " ride the oars " as he clearly does , in medium shot . Outstanding , though , is Ernest Borgnine as the Viking chief , boasting of the drunken , raping , murdering , pillaging Douglas - - " Has anyone ever had a finer son ? " And Borgnine's last shot , laughing , shouting the name of his god , and leaping into a pit of man-eating starving wolves ! It was Tony Curtis who allowed him to do so with a sword in his hand , so that Borgnine could enter Valhalla . This is in England , where the king had good reason to despise the Vikings and their queer customs . Curtis paid for that Viking courtesy with the loss of his hand . The king who lops off the offending extremity is King Aela , played by Frank Thring , who gives what is probably the second most impressive performance in the film . What a scuzzbag ! He wears a perpetual sneer , speaks in an effete manner , and radiates dismissive gestures . He flicks a few fingers and someone is led away to die . At the climax , the Vikings overrun Aela's castle and kill all the bad guys with their hatchets . Then there is a climactic sword fight between Douglas and Curtis - - two bitter enemies . Then , in a kind of Clio ex machina , Douglas , about to lop off the head of the helpless Curtis , hesitates when he realizes he's about to kill someone who is Ragnar's son , and Curtis takes advantage of the pause to dispatch Douglas . This duel takes place atop the windblown , topmost tower of a stone castle with a scintillating and icy blue bay in the background , its curlers foaming against the shore . You can almost smell the chill breeze of the sea . And that castle was built as a set , especially for the movie , if you can believe Fleischer's DVD comments . The music , by Mario Nascimbene , can hardly go unmentioned . It's not the triumphant trumpet-fanfare-filled sword and sandal score you'd expect . It's weird , but weird in an entirely original way . A rousing flick .
441878	819382	318974	7.0	Surrender is not an option . ( ? )	In World War II many Japanese soldiers fought according to the Samurai's code of Bushido , the way of the warrior , battling to the last man and committing sepuku rather than surrendering . And then there's the kamikaze business . The response of Americans to this was one of mixed contempt and bewilderment . Repeatedly , we still hear on TV documentaries some variation on the expression , " The Japanese fought to die for their country . We wanted to live for ours . " It was said that banzai attacks were made by soldiers crazed by drugs or hopped up on saki . " Fanatics , " we called them . We have in this movie a reflection of that ethos , only here they are called heroes because they're on " our " side . It's never convincingly explained why they threw their lives away . Maybe , for any number of reasons , they wanted to exchange fire with the Mexicans - - " The drunk delight of battle with my peers . " It's a well-done movie . Hancock is an efficient and perceptive director . The script is more thoughtful and less condescending than John Wayne's version of the story , and the acting is better too , particularly Billy Bob Thornton , who is an amazingly versatile actor . As Davy Crockett his flabby and expressive face radiates a gleam of mischief and irony most of the time , while at other moments he seems to be contemplating a bust of Homer . He's outstanding . Dennis Quaid is good too , an actor who always brings something interesting to each performance - - as Sam Houston , a husky voice and determined frown - - but he's not on screen that much . The battle scenes are well staged . The script gives all of the Americans and their compadres a courage touched by doubt . It also treats the Mexican soldiers as human beings . ( It's a good thing our neighbors to the south aren't North Koreans or Iranians , eh ? ) But there is a heavy - - Santa Ana . A real grease ball of a heavy too , with an unprepossessing face painted like a corpse in a funeral parlor , thin lips , an arrogant sneer , and a complete disregard for the lives of his men or anybody else . " What are the lives of soldiers ? They are like chickens . " Needless to say , any legitimate claims Mexico might have had on Texas aren't gone into . And yet this is an improvement over John Wayne's 1960 rendering . In the earlier film , the Americans are mostly comic figures playing lowbrow tricks on one another - - if you want to start a fight you have to knock a feather off your opponent's nose . Wayne's men all die super heroic deaths , with a mortally wounded Wayne deliberately blowing up an ammunition magazine , taking himself and dozens of the enemy with him . It's not exactly a " kamikaze " death but it will do . In this more recent movie , the men die for the most part just like everybody else inside the walls , except for Crockett who disdainfully invites the Mexican soldiers to perform their variation of harikiri on him . The special effects deserve mention too . I really don't know much about the Alamo or the military technology of the time but it's interesting to see cannonballs with fuzes , which sometimes sputter out . The camera even shows us the point of view of a Mexican cannonball soaring through the sky and plopping down in the middle of the Alamo's zocalo . And to see the effects of grapeshot or cannister on massed troops . In most movies set around this time or a bit later , in the Civil War , we never get to see a cannonball hit the ground . There is simply an explosion and a few stunt men are tossed into the air . Grapeshot is never shown and I don't know why , because in close quarters it was murderous , far more devastating to attacking troops than musket fire . Grapeshot turns a cannon into a huge shotgun full of bullet-sized balls . Cannister shot takes the shell into the midst of the enemy before it explodes and sprays its little iron balls about . It was responsible for most of the deaths among the men of Pickett's charge . At any rate , technology is given its due . The movie ends after the battle of San Jacinto . I'm not familiar with Texas ' history but I know something about movie scripts and this battle seems to be in the movie mainly because we won it . It's the equivalent of Doolittle's raid on Tokyo at the end of the unfortunate " Pearl Harbor . " What I mean is that it provides a victorious ending . This story really ended with the defeat at the Alamo . I can't help wondering what this story would be like if the movie had been made by Mexico . How hard would it be to paint Texas as a secessionist province of the national territory , not unlike the Confederate South , except that Texas was being supported and populated by a foreign power ? Could they really declare their independence , just because they didn't like the central government ? A nice symbolic touch . The Alamo is surrounded by Mexican soldiers who persistently play the Deguello , a song meaning " no mercy . " It is sunset and Davy Crockett says , " I know what's missing , " and he takes out his violin , goes to the roof , and using the Mexican band as an accompanying orchestra he smoothly begins to improvise a tune which ends in a sprightly jig . A nocturne in which one lonely fiddle defies a marching band . A cavalry march turned into a violin concerto . It's a better movie than I'd expected it to be . I'd recommend watching it . You'll get involved , even if you're already familiar with the events themselves .
441879	819382	98051	7.0	Workable thriller .	Kind of an enjoyable , undemanding political thriller in which Tommy Lee Jones is a hired assassin and Gene Hackman is an Army sergeant who tries to find him , while he himself is hunted by the police after being framed for a murder . There are predictable elements in the plot . A car chase through the streets of Chicago , a bloody assassination in Germany , Russians who scowl and look like albino prunes , Nazi thugs , bullets through the forehead , a sniper with a very professional looking rifle , a patsy , a vast right-wing conspiracy involving the Army , the Chicago police , and some independent agents . Actually , the plot lost me here and there . ( Why did Jones have to be smuggled into the USA under a false identity ? ) But it doesn't matter . Things roll right along , with fine location shooting in a bleak Chicago winter . Those snowy windy deserted alleys will freeze your eyeballs for you . Hackman has never damaged a film he's been in . Tommy Lee Jones is unique in his delivery . Joanna Cassidy has a face full of character . Hardy Kruger looks just as he did 30 years ago . What happened to his career ? He's hardly on screen here , and is only given two lines , one of them in Russian . And he was so good in " Sundays and Cybele . " Dennis Franz contributes an authentic Chicago accent , which somehow manages to transmogrify the word " car " into " care " . All of which is to say the acting is quite good . It's a relatively realistic movie too . Nobody performs superhero stunts . Hackman is the hero and yet is flawed enough to get beaned over the head and , later , captured . Nobody leaps tall buildings in a single bound . There are no exploding fireballs or heads . The narrative is straightforward and unadorned by slow-motion deaths or fancy photography . The director has shown a bit of taste . If you're not in the mood to have your thought provoked or your emotions gripped , this is a good movie to watch , as you while away your time .
443344	819382	516905	7.0	Good-bye , Mrs . Peel . ( Sob )	I don't know that this episode is any more whimsical than the others . The plots were rarely the point anyway . The point was understated style , and this episode has that in abundance . But there are differences between this and the earlier episodes . The Organization that Steed and Mrs . Peel worked for is here revealed as The Treasury . The plot is farther than usual away from reality - - not that the others were rooted in the same behavior stream as yours and mine . Emma departs the series , to its detriment . She wasn't only a stunner in her predatory , foxy way . She was a fine actress too . Did a splendid job as Regan in Olivier's TV production of " King Lear . " And that burnished voice . Tara King isn't bad but she's hardly an adequate replacement , cute without being exotic .
442801	819382	488120	7.0	Tricky Mystery	Nicely done , stylish puzzler about a man who murders his wife . Anthony Hopkins discovers that his wife , Embeth Davidtz , is having one of those anonymous affairs with Billy Burke , who happens to be a detective in LA homicide . One night she comes home from an assignation and Hopkins coolly shoots her in the head . The shot is heard and the police surround the house , led by Burke himself . Hopkins eventually allows Burke to enter the house alone , with the proviso that he lay down his gun , just as Hopkins will put down the pistol he's holding in his hand . Not knowing that Hopkins is his lover's husband , Burke asks , " Is your wife alright ? " , asks Burke . " I don't think so , " replies Hopkins , " I just shot her in the head . " Burke sees the comatose body of Davidtz and , bang , runs to her and tries to revive her , taking his eyes off Hopkins for a few critical moments . It seems that Hopkins ' goose is cooked , doesn't it ? He's confessed that he's shot his wife . His gun is found . The barely alive body is lying there . No one has entered or left the house since the shot was heard . The case looks like a no-brainer , so it's given to Ryan Gosling in the Tom Cruise role of a cocky young lawyer who is just about to leave the DA's office for greener pastures . But , lo ! Hopkins ' confiscated gun is not the murder weapon ! It can't be , because it's never been fired . Hopkins represents himself at the trial and - - smart as a whip - - he gets the charge of attempted murder dropped because of the absence of physical evidence . Not only that . Billy Burke has been sitting through the trial and when the case is dismissed he shoots himself . Then , twitting Gosling , whose number he's got , Hopkins whispers confidentially that as a final gesture he's going to pull the plug on Embeth Davidtz . Despite his rushing to the hospital with a court order , Gosling is unable to prevent the final insult . They pull the plug and she flatlines . Medical discretion forbids further plot revelations . Hopkins is good to great , as usual . He's getting older though and although this role suits him well enough , romantic leads will soon be behind him . Billy Burke is stolid as the lover . I can't say I've ever found Ryan Gosling less than irritating . He projects cockiness and self satisfaction but his range seems limited . He's less believable , far less , when he's been deflated . He may be a nice guy in real life - - loves his dog and collects stamps , for all I know - - but he always reminds me of the high school jock who never lacks for female friendship and acts out his advantage over the rest of us no-more-than-ordinarily handsome kids . Too many smirks and not enough self doubt . The plot itself has some holes in it , some of them sizable enough to drive a Ford Navigator through . Hopkins really has brains . He's built this elaborate device or game out of channels of tubing that you can roll ball bearings down and it takes five minutes of capering before the steel balls reach the bottom . They practically do entre chats . This device I take to be a symbol for the way Hopkins ' mind works . And a good one because , after all , a legal autodidact , he becomes an Allan Dershowitz almost overnight in the court room . Yet he makes a thoughtless and pointless move at the end that brings about his own ruin . He spills the balls all over the floor . And I'm getting tired of looking at dark blue images on the screen . My eyeballs are about to go into shock at the sight of a hot pink object . Why is everything so dark , so gloomy ? Why is the court room itself so dark ? And a hospital ? I'm hoping photographers will rediscover the visible spectrum . Not to say this isn't a film worth catching . It's nicely written and classically staged . No directorial furor . No cinematic fireworks . No car chases . It reminds me a bit of Hitchcock's " Dial M for Murder , " based on Frederick Knott's play . Except that Hitchcock's murder thriller wasn't nearly so dark .
441982	819382	71847	7.0	What we escaped from .	This isn't going to be everybody's favorite movie . The production values don't shoot out the lights . All the sets are indoors . There's no motion to speak of . The whole shebang seems static and talky . Yet it's an important document and in some ways well done . If much of the dialog sounds stilted it's because it was taken from official sources . So we get a lot of formal speech and very little in the way of offhand nudges . But the acting , at least in the important roles , is really pretty good . DeVane as JFK , Martin Sheen as his brother Bobby , and Howard DaSilva as Krushchev are outstanding . Most impressive is the way this film takes us back to what now seems almost like a Golden Age , despite the missile crisis and the insanity of Mutual Assured Destruction . It was a time when a president would make certain that the meetings were attended by an old Cold Warrior , Dean Acheson , even though Acheson was presumed to represent a dated point of view and was only a private citizen at the time , because the president wanted to hear all points of view during brainstorming sessions . In discussing those planning sessions , Robert MacNamara describes President Kennedy leaning towards military action in order to save face , and one of the participants saying to him , " Mister President , you're wrong . " ( " That took guts , " says MacNamara in Errol Morris's documentary , " The Fog of War . " ) I was in school at the time of these events and no one knew anything except what was released to the media . If we'd known how close we were to war I believe church attendance would have soared . Many incidents and coincidences came together to get the world out of that tight spot , chief among them the reluctance of both sides to engage in war . Both Krushchev and Kennedy had a pretty good idea of how that worked . JFK had written a book about it . More than that , imagine a president who is able to muse that he recently finished reading Barbara Tuchman's history of the accidental beginning of World War I , " The Guns of August " . " If I could do it , I'd send a copy to every commanding officer aboard the blockading destroyers - - not that they'd read it . " The resolution of the conflict , despite missteps and mistakes on both sides , hinged on a single event . Krushchev , depressed , wrote an ameliorative letter to Kennedy , saying that he understood Kennedy's position , and that he , Krushchev was willing to dismantle the Cuban missiles in return for a guarantee that the USA would neither launch nor aid any invasion of Cuba in the future . ( Using anti-Castro Cubans , we had invaded the island at the Bay of Pigs , which was a miserable failure . ) At last both sides seemed to have what they wanted . The USA was getting rid of the missile threat , and the USSR was getting a guarantee of Cuba's sovereignty . Alas , under political pressure from his " war camp " at home , Krushcheve wrote a second letter , much harder in tone , reneging on earlier proposals and adding demands which the USA could not grant . Two mutually conflicting proposals a day apart . What to do ? What they did was follow Robert Kennedy's suggestion . They ignored the second letter and responded only to the first . More fumbles and confusion followed but the crisis was eventually resolved with both sides compromising , but not in ways that jeopardized their own defenses . The crisis required - - and got - - deft handling at the top and cautious but effective diplomacy . That's why I used the expression " Golden Age " before . As drama , this isn't much . No villains , no fist fights , and not a gun in sight . Yet for its educational value alone , in our somewhat history-shy culture , it ought to be seen by everyone , especially now .
442481	819382	420223	7.0	Third Person Omniscient .	This fantasy begins as a blend of " The Truman Show " with a soupçon of " The Accidental Tourist " and I expected a tricky commercial property designed in the course of some overnight caffeine binge to bring in as many shekels as possible . It's better than that , and I wound up waiting rather tensely to see how the thing would turn out . Will Ferrell is an obsessive-compulsive IRS auditor who lives a heavily regimented life , dictated by the reminders on his multiple-function wrist watch , joyless and humorless . He's as boring as they come . We just KNOW some hot babe or something is going to turn his life upside down , and it does . He begins to hear a woman's voice inside his head . The voice describes what he's doing and what he has done , down to the smallest detail , using the third person or his actual name - - Harold Crick . Something is going on but Ferrell doesn't know what . The voice at first puzzles him , then irritates him . He shouts out demands that it stop , but the only things that stop are other pedestrians who stare at him . Actually , this being New York , I think he could stand in the street and shout all he likes without any interference . I don't want to spell out all the plot developments because the story is a little complicated . Ferrell sees a shrink , Linda Hunt , who refers him to a professor of literature , Dustin Hoffman , who may be able to figure out what kind of narrative he's listening to - - and living . It's a tragedy , as it turns out , and Ferrell had better find out whose writing it before he's killed off . The writer turns out to be real enough , a blocked novelist , Emma Thompson , and Ferrell tracks her down and they work things out , so to speak . There's the inevitable spirit-of-life woman too , Maggie Gyllenhaal , who introduces him to love , milk and cookies , and Tiffany lamps . With this kind of narrative it's only natural to ask if the " writer " stands for Somebody Else . I mean , here is someone laying out the course of a human life . Is Thompson God ? Can God be a woman who has writer's block and smokes too much ? Nahh . Woman , yes . Writer's block and smoking , no . The best performances are from Emma Thompson , Byllenhall , and Dustin Hoffman . Will Ferrell looks and acts the part of a man whose favorite word is " integer " but he does so uninterestingly . On the other hand , it's a tough part . Maybe Bill Murray would have handled it . In a plot as tricky as this there are bound to be lacunae in the logic . For instance , he's trying to track down the genuine source of the voice in his head . He discovers the voice seems to belong to a real writer . But the voice has used some strange locutions . I'd have started my investigation by Googling the word " unmitigatable . " See who's used it before . There couldn't be that many . And then too , Ferrell finally finds and confronts the author of his life , Emma Thompson , takes the almost-finished manuscript to Dustin Hoffman , and it is agreed by all concerned that the story must end tragically with Ferrell's death . Nonsense . Why couldn't Thompson have written the thing as a tragedy then added a single , final sentence - - " And he woke up to find it had all been a dream " ? It worked in Fritz Lang's " Woman in the Window . " And as for literature , " Finnegans Wake " is ALL dream . Plaudits to the writer though . There's some clever stuff going on here , which overcomes occasional distractions in the direction . It's too bad that Ferrell is as unengaging as he is . He's even uninteresting when he wises up and begins to stretch out . There seems to be a big hole in the screen when he appears , and he's the central figure . The movie may be a little too charmed by its own premise . Still - - overall - - it's a more thoughtful film than you might anticipate , not as gimmicky as it sounds . Would have made a good novel .
443573	819382	45323	7.0	Robust and unpretentious comedy from Ford .	I can't remember the silent version , which I saw years ago . I think it's probably best known for the fact that the cuss words of Captain Flagg and Sergeant Quirt were clearly discernible , even to viewers without advanced training in lip reading . I have no idea what the original play was like . Ford's version could be described as pointless , energetic , and at times extremely amusing . There are battle scenes , of course , because this romantic triangle between Flagg ( Cagney ) , Quirt ( Dailey ) , and Charmaine ( Calvet ) is being played out against the muddy background of World War I . But , with a few exceptions , the combat scenes , like the romance , are played for laughs . And not in the black-comedy manner of " Dr . Strangelove , " either . ( That sort of ridiculous tragedy might be beyond Ford's comprehension . ) No , the shots of Dailey and Cagney crawling through the mud of No Man's Land with a German prisoner in tow are funny in themselves . Even when the German is killed by shell fire and Dailey is wounded . It's in no way a " deep " film . Nothing so banal as " war is hell . " And it is certainly not one of those anti-war films in which we bleed , sometimes without purpose , but we always win in the end . Flagg's unit marches off to battle yet again , with some of the men limping from wounds and Flagg himself drunk , but there is no triumphant final clash . As pure entertainment , it succeeds fully . The Ephrons , who wrote the screenplay , must have had second sight into the interests and talents of Ford , Cagney , and Dailey because they're all superb . The dialog has to be heard to be enjoyed . Waving his finger as if in an Italian opera , Cagney shouts at the heroic Robert Wagner , " Boy - - I'm going to see that you are sent up for a decoration ! Furthermore - - I PERSONALLY am going to give you - - TEN FRANCS ! " Cagney has never given a more outrageously animated performance , brusque , stomping , marching around , fuming , looking cockeyed . All his mannerisms are here and he plays them to the hilt . Dailey is only a few steps behind him . And Corinne Calvet as the perfidious Charmaine puts what she has into the role but the character , while maddeningly flirtatious , comes across as a little insipid too . How could it be otherwise ? Look at the company she's in . Wagner's love affair with the school-girlish Marissa Pavan is taken seriously , though , and a sappy , sentimental love song is sneaked into the script . Calvet sings a couple of period songs too , but they're mercifully brief . I never cared a fig whether Flagg or Quirt or either of them got to marry Charmaine . And the " what price glory ? " speech , given by a seriously wounded Marine , is misdirected at Flagg . Whatever else Flagg may be interested in , it's not glory . Ford had his demons and was not an easy man to work with , or even necessarily to be acquainted with . In his memoirs , James Cagney recounts some stunt Ford had performed over and over , involving a motorcycle and sidecar plowing into a pile of manure . The gags weren't funny . They were just sadistic and dangerous . And a few years after this release , Ford called Robert Wagner into his office and asked if he was interested in the part of Martin Pawley in the upcoming " The Searchers . " Wagner eagerly said yes , and Ford asked why . Wagner explained - - great script , fascinating character , and so on , until Ford replied , " That's too bad because I've already given the part to Jeffery Hunter . " The disappointed Wagner was half-way out the door when Ford stopped him . " Do you REALLY want that part badly ? " " Yes , " said Wagner . Ford said , " But Jeffrey Hunter is going to play it . " End of interview . Ford's Schadenfreude notwithstanding , it's hard to beat this comedy for sheer momentum . When James Gleason , as a Marine General , sweeps into Cagney's office with a map he wants Cagney to examine , the two of them simply brush all the junk on Cagney's desk onto the floor and spread out the map . What kind of mind thinks up such a gesture ?
441987	819382	43132	7.0	Noir Exemplar	" Film noir " is an overused expression when it comes to describing films . Every crime drama seems to be a " noir " . But " Where the Sidewalk Ends " really is a good example of what the genre is all about . Very briefly , an overzealous detective ( Andrews ) accidentally kills a no-goodnik who works for the mobsters . The killing is blamed on the father ( Tom Tully ) of a woman Andrews meets and falls for ( Tierney ) . To save Dad from Old Sparky , Andrews captures the rest of the mob and turns himself in . The morally guilty cop is driven by impulses from the past . His father was a thief who was killed trying to shoot his way out of jail . But that doesn't excuse his actions after he accidentally offs the no-goodnik in self defense . He immediately goes to the phone to report the incident but he hesitates . He's already in hot water with the department and this could finish his career . Then , at just the wrong moment , the phone rings . It's Andrews ' partner and Andrews tells him the suspect they're trailing isn't at home . He hides the body and later disposes of it by slugging a watchman and dumping the body in the river . What motivates a guy to do something so dumb ? Okay . His job was at risk . But now he's committed multiple felonies . At least I think they must be multiple . I counted obstruction of justice , assault , disposing of a body without a permit , littering , first-degree mopery , and bearing false witness against his neighbor . In the end , we don't know whether to root for Andrews or not . The suspect didn't deserve to die , true , but it was after all an accident because Andrews didn't know he was a war hero and " had a silver plate in his head . " Maybe it's that kind of ambiguity that made noir what it was , among other things such as characteristic lighting . If noir involved nothing more than black-and-white photography , murder , criminals , mystery , and suspicious women , then we'd have to include all the Charlie Chan movies under that rubric . Andrews is pretty good . He's a kind of Mark MacPherson ( from " Laura " ) gone bitter . He never laughs , and rarely smiles , even when seated across a restaurant table from Gene Tierney , a situation likely to prompt smiles in many men . He has no sense of humor at all . His few wisecracks are put-downs . When he shoves a stoolie into a cab and the stoolie says , " Careful . I almost hit my head , " Andrews ' riposte is , " That's okay . The cab's insured . " Andrews could seem kind of wooden at times but this is a role that calls for stubborn and humorless determination and he handles it well . His underplaying is perfect for the part . Little twitches or blinks project his thoughts and emotional states . And I guess the director , Otto Preminger , stopped him from pronouncing bullet as " BOO-let " and police as " POE-lice . " Never could make up my mind about Gene Tierney . She does alright in the role of Tom Tully's daughter , a model , but she's like Marilyn Monroe in that you can't separate the adopted mannerisms from the real personality traits . Did Tierney actually have such an innocent , almost saintly persona ? When she answered the phone at home , did her voice have the same sing-along quality that it has on screen ? Poor Tierney went through some bad psychiatric stuff , before there were any effective meds for bipolar disorder . And Andrews too , nice guy though he appears to have been , slipped into alcoholism before finally recovering and making public service announcements . The DVD commentary by Peter Muller is unpretentious , informed , and sometimes amusing . Anyway , this is a good film as well as a good example of film noir . The good guys aren't all good , although the bad guys are all bad . Maybe that ambiguity is what makes it an adult picture instead of a popcorn movie . For the kiddies , only one shot is fired on screen and nobody's head explodes . Sorry .
443206	819382	67959	7.0	Bonjour Tristesse Tropique	Nicholas Roeg has this thing for sex and hidden menace . He even turns the fork of a tree into an obscene photograph . And the teen aged Jenny Agutter is no help either , running around in this skimpy skirt or in her underwear or sometimes nothing at all , which is nice . Meanwhile anything can happen . There's death around every corner . It's a simple story on the face of it . A father - - one of those Richard Cory types - - takes his kids ( Agutter and Luc Roeg ) for a drive into the desert . He parks the car for a picnic in the middle of nowhere and tries to shoot them - - rather a shocking moment since the film hasn't set it up . Failing that , he sets fire to the car and blows out his brains . The two kids must get home but they go about it in the dumbest way imaginable . Instead of following the car's tire tracks back to a road they take off in a random direction . And , really , since they were driven inland from Sidney ( Adelaide in the novel ) , they ought to head east towards the sea , meaning they should walk towards the rising sun . But , man , these kids are out of their element . If it weren't for their accidentally running into aboriginal David Gumpilil , they wouldn't get very far . Fortunately he knows how to extract a living from what seems to be a most unpromising environment . He hunts and he gathers , as hunters and gatherers do , and there are some unpleasant scenes of real animals being speared to death . It's like watching a movie in Anthropology 101 . Still , Gumpilil kills only to eat , and otherwise lives in harmony with nature . Roeg's film alas contrasts Gumpilil's cheerful optimism and , finally , his mortal love for Agutter , with the ways of the white folks . They seem uniformly nuts , wasteful , and unfriendly . They shoot and kill buffalo for no evident reason and leave the carcass to actively rot - - and I mean " actively . " A nice close up shot of a decomposing buffalo's mouth crawling with maggots . Gag me with a spoon ! The ways of the white folks are represented mainly by abandoned farmhouses and an abandoned mine , filled with rusting junk . It's an odd story . For all the troubles they've been through , neither Agutter nor her brother seems particularly disturbed . After their father eats his gun , there's no reaction to it , and there is only the briefest reference to it late in the story . Luc Roeg asks Agutter why his father killed himself and she brushes it off with , " I don't know . " I don't know why he's dead either . I don't know why Gumpilil props himself up in a tree and dies after courting Agutter in this spooky manner . Maybe it was something he ate . If Roeg's view of Western civilization is justified , somebody should have explained to Gumpilil that it's best for him to have nothing to do with any of them , Agutter's definitive nubility notwithstanding . But these two deaths , like many other things in the film , go unexplained , as they might in real life . There's a tacked-on epilogue with Agutter married but still dreaming of her walkabout . A . E . Houseman's poem makes it all seem wistful and full of contentment , although that's not exactly what the film has shown us . What we've witnessed is a tragedy in slow motion . In any case , you are guaranteed to have a hard time shaking this one out of your memory .
441676	819382	498380	7.0	Do what is right , because it is right .	This is a pretty courageous movie . Eastwood has produced and directed the story of one of the most bitter conflicts of World War II - - which we get to see from the Japanese point of view . The Americans ( OUR side ) are the faceless enemies ! And it's not done by the numbers either . The doomed Japanese are not handled with careless and facile sentimentality . Some are loyal and brave , but humane - - notably Ken Watanabe's officer . Others are stern with their own troops and savage towards the US troops . They all demonstrate emotions of one sort or another , recognizably human . It's a more concentrated version of the Japanese soldiers we saw in films like Cornell Wild's " Beach Red " and David Lean's " The Bridge on the River Kwai . " If Eastwood's " Flags of Our Fathers " was heads , this is the tails side of the same coin . The same - - yet , not the same . " Flags of Our Fathers " is the better film for a number of reasons . One is that the earlier film had focus that this one lacks . Three Marines and a Navy corpsman touring the states on a trumped-up victory trip to raise money . We got to know the four guys and the tragic aftermath of their victory . The structure of " Letters From Iwo Jima " is more diffuse . With the exception of Watanabe , it's hard to tell one Japanese soldier from another , partly because the film is shot almost entirely in darkness , the color is desaturated to the point at which it is almost black and white , and because uniforms , as always , make it difficult to tell who's who . ( " Band of Brothers " had a similar problem . ) The " letters " in the title aren't often heard from in the film . Nothing easy . No , " I love you , darling , and I miss the cherry blossoms in the Spring . " Rather , an officer reads a letter found on a dying Marine . It's from his mother , who advises him to " do what is right , because it's right . " Later , before ordering his men on a suicidal attack , he preps them with the same words . Presumably the writer meant the parallel to be ironic , but she hit on a larger question . Exactly what does " right " mean ? Even if you are able to step outside the box and examine your situation objectively , what ethic is available as a guide ? In the case of Iwo Jima , " right " meant dying with honor to the Japanese . Pragmatically , it now seems foolish . The Japanese had built fifteen miles of tunnels under the little island , some of the tunnel walls were shellacked . It was like living in a hotel with no room service . Yet the American fleet consisted of 150 ships which , if they'd been in a line-astern formation , would have stretched for seventy miles . Theoretically , the battle was over the moment the fleet appeared . The hopeless resistance led to the spilling of blood by about all of the Japanese and an appalling number of Marines . Would we have done things differently ? Probably . We surrendered in a nice pragmatic way on Wake Island . Ditto the British in Singapore . Ditto the American and Fillipino troops on Bataan , although there were undoubtedly those among them for whom " surrender is not an option " was a popular slogan . It's a sad movie and truly anti war . The final scene has Watanabe's brief case being dug up year later and its contents dumped unceremoniously out onto the dusty soil . The contents are nothing more than personal letters . Lots of letters . What seems like hundreds and hundreds of letters , leaving us with the impression that Watanabe , like the other casualties on both sides , would have had a lot more to say had he lived .
442369	819382	369672	7.0	The Odd Trio	Drenched in the humidity of a New Orleans summer ( that's a rough quote from the florid and unnecessary narration ) , the movie gives us an odd trio . Bobby Long ( Travolta ) is an old ex-literature professor . Lawson Pines ( Macht ) is his protégé and former teaching assistant who is now supposedly writing Bobby Long's biography . Purcy Will ( Johansson ) is an 18-year-old drifter whose mother dies , leaving her the shabby house that Long and Pines have been living in for years . I won't try to describe the situation when Purcy shows up and looks over the house and its occupants . I will let her line describe it : " Oh , sure , I want to live in this shole with two alcoholic strangers . " And , let's face it , the interior of the place is a dark , dank garbage dump of books and Early Orange Crate furniture and one filthy bed , in which Bobby Long is sleeping off a drunk . The outside isn't much better . If it were larger it could have been one of those wrecked mansions now haunted , especially if the yard were cleared of those busted old recliners and rickety tables and decrepit barbecues . The acting is fine . Travolta is pretty good as the down but not quite out patriarch , " the eldest man , " as he puts it . He's a better , more engaging actor than I've been willing to give him credit for . Macht is adequate as a younger guy getting more and more fed up with being Travolta's toady . And Johansson is first rate . Her presence is appealing in a non-Hollywood way . She's not " cute " like Jessica Alba , nor beautiful like Jennifer Connolly . The way she looks , sounds , and acts is sui generis . Her voice has an occasional catch in it , a slight croak , and is anything but mellifluous . Her visual impression is off kilter too : a generous bosom , skinny legs , and a face that is difficult to pin down : the widest cheekbones adorning the modern screen , a broad forehead and narrow chin , plump and sensual lips , and surprisingly graceful eyes - - and she's a decent actress too . All three of the principals are up to professional standards and so are the minor players , each of them individuated by the script . ( One guy has a constant cough , another neighbor is a florist , and so forth . ) But if there's a weakness in the film , it's the plot . Southern writers have a way with words , if not ideas , and they are adept at catching exactly the right words in exchanges . Johansson dreams of becoming an X-Ray technician because " the bones look so good on the light boxes . Kinda like a portrait , only on the inside . " That's not bad writing . Sometimes , though , however dazzling and pellucid the dialog , the stories themselves tend to whine away like flywheels building up momentum but going nowhere . Beth Henley's stories have this same problem and Tennessee Williams ran into it once in a while too . The dramatic events in these sharply observed lives sometimes come to feel shoehorned in . There is often a Big Secret , hinted at but not revealed until the plot cries out for some kind of drama . ( This movie has two secrets . ) Somebody usually dies at the end because without such a momentous climax it might seem as if the camel had labored to bring forth a gnat . There is a death at the end of this movie too , but although we can see it coming we are mercifully spared the suffering and sadness and the deathbed revelations . The photography and location shooting are fine too . We only see a few minutes of the French Quarter and there is no Mardi Gras . The features of the city that we do see are small ones , carefully observed . Somebody is munching on a " poor boy " as submarine sandwiches are called in that neighborhood . The local bar , whose manager is a nice guy , has the go-to-hell name of Rock Bottom Cafe . And , man , those neighborhoods are seedy and broken down . I don't suppose they exist anymore , not after Katarina earlier this year . Can't decide whether it's good or bad . The neighborhoods looked poor but comfortable and , above all , tolerant . Actually , despite whatever criticisms I may have made , I applaud this movie . It was made for adults . There is not a fist fight in it , nor a car chase or explosion . People lead pretty ordinary lives and their triumphs are tiny while their defeats may be grand ones . It's slow but it draws one in . The sentiment goes overboard once in a while , but I was moved when Travolta and Johansson embraced tearfully before the end . A rewarding film . They should make more like it .
443361	819382	343172	7.0	Strangely involving minor film .	There's nothing much to the story . A young woman steals some money from the dreary Vermont supermarket where she works , decides to run away to Florida where he has dreams of attending school with her friend Julie , and encounters an odd couple on the highway . If you remember the elderly couple from " Rosemary's Baby , " you have some idea of what these two are like . Bill has a comical face and is retired from the Army . Sandra is an ex stripper now become a truckstop whore , although we don't find this out at once . They're affectionate , helpful , and full of common sense . They more or less adopt the girl , Alice , and promise to give her a ride in their elaborate RV , although they are not driving " directly " to Florida . This is where the film could have gone one-hundred-percent wrong . All the film makers had to do was turn the elderly couple into the personification of evil . They would take the virginal Alice ( handcuffed to the bed or whatever ) and sell her body to any greaseball driver who has a lot of money and likes rough sex . ( Alice would have had a heck of a time escaping , with lots of aborted attempts , before the final shootout . ) But , no . The couple really IS pretty nice , and Alice is far from virginal . Alice overhears Sandra with a customer , asks about the business , and tries to turn a trick on her own . Bill prevents anything from happening and insists she do the job right if she's going to do it at all . They don't talk her into it . They guide her . Alice makes several hundred dollars , which is several hundred dollars more than she had when she met the couple . Bill and Sandra keep her money in the safe where customers aren't going to find it . Alice misunderstands . She doesn't find whoring very pleasant work , and she thinks she'll never be paid off because every time she asks to be dropped off , Sandra responds with , " What ? Not here , honey . Not in the middle of nowhere . " However , after she is talked into handing her gun over to Sandra , the couple give her the money she wants and rather lovingly release her to continue her trip to Florida . You know what I found the most tragic moment in the film ? It had nothing to do with prostitution or thievery . Alice has been expecting to room with her friend Julie after she arrives in Miami . Julie is after all a legitimate student . But when Alice calls her friend from someplace in Alabama to assure her she's on her way but will be late , Julie hesitates and says , " Well - - my mother doesn't think you should room with us . And to tell you the truth , my roommate isn't cool on it either . I invited you down , sure , but I thought it was just like a visit for a week or something . Go back to Milford , Alice " There is a long silence before Alice hangs up . Only one shot is fired ( a few white frames of film ) and no one is hit . Tears appear only once . Nobody slugs anybody else . No car explodes in a fireball . No cop chases them down the Interstate . The direction is occasionally clumsy . Too much cross-cutting between Sandra trying to disarm Alice and Alice's hand holding the wobbling pistol . There is hardly any musical score . There is brief male and female nudity and it's awkward , as it's probably supposed to be . Alice isn't unattractive but she is not babalicious either . She sports Asiatic eyes , a kind of robust version of Molly Parker . The cinematography looks cheap and the colors are washed out . The direction is a straightforward narrative , with a few illuminating flashbacks . Nothing is wasted . And it was all evidently shot around Danbury , Connecticut . The city sticks in my mind because I drove through it after one of its floods and remember the cars caked with a film of mud all the way up to the door handles . I don't know exactly What Alice Found . ( I dread even THINKING that the answer to the riddle is that " she found herself . " ) The acting isn't bad at all . Judith Ivey is better than that . It's definitely worth seeing , a quiet , orderly film that treats the audience like adults .
442949	819382	27630	7.0	Probably Fred and Ginger's Best .	What an entertaining movie . Astaire and Randolph Scott are in the Navy . Astaire has to woo back Ginger in San Francisco , while Scott must be persuaded that Harriet Hilliard is worthy of being his wife . Everything works out fine . It's sometimes argued , and I can see why , that Scott's romance with Hilliard is unnecessary and slows the plot down . Especially painful are Hilliard's singing of sappy love songs . I could have done without her singing , right enough , but I found the romance rather touching . Hilliard enters the movie as a music teacher , wearing a pair of spectacles , no makeup , and the ugliest clothes known to man or beast . No wonder Scott avoids her until she grooms herself sexily under the tutelage of her sister Ginger and a slinky Lucille Ball . The problem is that AFTER her makeover she looks like the same irretrievably plain woman as before , only with a glossier outfit . It's tough enough for a homely guy . But at least a man can become wealthy and powerful and popular , then he can collect women anyway , even if he looks like JoJo the Dog-Faced Boy . But what does a plain-looking woman do ? The same avenues to romance aren't open to her . Henry Kissinger had groupies . Did Margaret Thatcher ? It must be terrible to be an ordinary woman in a culture as cruel as ours . As a kind of a footnote , I must mention that Randolph Scott was rumored to be bisexual by Hollywood gossips who needed some nonsense to chew on , and it's kind of amusing that he has the following line in this film when he's putting homely Hilliard off - - " Women don't interest me , sister . " The movie probably gives more quality time to Ginger Rogers than any of her other films with Astaire . And she's marvelous . She's beautiful , sexy , a talented actress and dancer , and the script gives her good comic lines too . " Let's kiss and make up , " suggests Astaire . " Let's just make up , " she says , " that will give you something to work on . " It's also the only film she made with Astaire that gives her a solo number during an audition . ( Choreographed by Hermes Pan . ) Her performance is accidentally sabotaged by Astaire who slips some Alka Seltzer or something into her water , and she hiccups through her number , burping being too indelicate for the time . As a dancer , I'd make a terrific circus elephant so my opinion must be taken as that of an amateur , but I think their dances together are the equal of any they put on film . Their first , during a dancing contest , " Let Yourself Go , " is the most wildly exuberant of any I can remember . And the only dramatic duet , " Let's Face the Music and Dance , " must be among their finest . The last step as they exit is startling . I like the film for reasons with personal resonance . I remember seeing it for the first time in a theater in downtown San Diego , next to a shop called " The Seven Seas " that catered to sailors . I was in uniform at the time and was impressed with the treatment of the naval careers of Astaire and Scott . What I mean is , here we have this frothy musical comedy which owed absolutely nothing to historical reality , and yet , unlike most of their other teamings , pays its dues anyway . Jumping ship , Astaire calls out for a " water taxi . " I had just taken a water taxi ashore myself . The uniforms are correct to the period ( unlike , say , those in " On the Town " ) . And they're worn properly , hats down to two finger-widths above the eyebrow and not cocked back . And there are two incidents in which Astaire runs into a problem with naval authorities and they're both handled with perfect seriousness and are thoroughly believable . An officer stops Astaire from leading a jazz band during inspection and reports to the captain , " They were playing when the call was sounded , sir . I'm certain no breach of discipline was intended . " It's what an officer - - a good officer - - would say , and nobody laughs . The series was getting a little repetitious by the time " Follow the Fleet " was made so instead of putting Fred into high society and a tuxedo , they turned him into a gum-chewing swabbie instead . It was a good idea . And the dance numbers are up to the concept .
441883	819382	32762	8.0	Crackerjack	SPOILERS . . . It's hard to imagine that an unassuming fantasy adventure like this would be made today . There are no pop songs in it . There are no outstanding special effects . The makeup isn't grotesque . It's black and white . And we no longer believe in selfless heroes or in crude villains . This movie owes quite a bit to 1937's " Robin Hood , " not just in its theme but in particular scenes . Diego visits his true love by climbing onto her balcony . Rathbone is the villain . The good guys disguise themselves as monks . And it's got Montagu Love , only he's on the side of the angels here . The bit about Don Diego Vega acting like a " puppy " is probably borrowed from " The Scarlet Pimpernel . " But none of this is bothersome . It's an outstanding classic on its own . Several scenes and bits of business stand out . First of all , we have what is probably the best fencing scene on film , between Power and Rathbone , using sabres . ( When we first meet Rathbone's character he is shown executing a perfect slow lunge . The fencing coach was Cavens , who also handled " Robin Hood " to less effect . ) Second , there is a dance between Power and Linda Darnell , who was just a teenager at the time and looks beautiful and vulnerable . The song is a simple folk song in - - " El Sombrero Blanco . " It's not a long dance and it's not gussied up with the Buffalo Philharmonic either , but it's a treat to watch and listen to , a marvelous arrangement . Darnell doesn't have much to do except stand and wave her voluminous skirts from side to side and Power is no Jose Greco , but he assumes the proper hypermasculine position that Spanish dancers still use and does a kind of flamenco style tap dance . The clash between the good guys and the bad guys at the end is a bit of a disappointment , one of those wild melees with lots of clanging swords and a comic figure bumping bad guys over the head with a club . No real acting skills are required of the cast . The characters and their motives are far too simple for that . But Power with his curled Spanish hair and sly mustache looks right and his effete Don Diego is amusing . ( The disguise seems to cost him some effort , although he was bisexual . ) He has a very funny moment when he asks for Lolita's hand in marriage . He's sitting in an armchair ( he's always complaining of " fatigue " ) and has just taken a pinch of snuff . " I beg to ask for your niece's hand , " he announces slowly in a distracted tone . Everyone waits for him to finish the utterance , but he's on the verge of a sneeze , his mouth open , gazing at the floor with a mixture of boredom and irritation as he waits to see if the sneeze is going to take place . While wearing this goofy expression , he manages to come up with , " A refusal would crush me . " Then he sits back again ( the progress of the sneeze was aborted ) and taps his mouth with a lacy handkerchief . The script is ironic and witty . Of course even the suggestion of homosexuality had to be avoided but it's an undercurrent throughout Diego's performance . Lots of talk about fabrics and scents . There's a fascinating exchange between Power and Rathbone , who are competing for the affection of a married lady . Rathbone is puncturing an orange with a small knife , over and over . " The Capitan seems to regard that fruit as an enemy , " remarks Power . Rathbone looks up glowering and replies , " A rival . " And at one point , reminded that he is to fight another duel in a few minutes , Power slaps his forehead and exclaims , " Santa Maria ! It slipped my mind ! " The photography by Arther Miller is black and white at its most functional . The set design is so delightfully Mexican ( there's a cactus or agave in every other scene ) that one wishes Los Angeles could turn back the clock . Can I add a slightly less relevant note ? This is what I think of as a " latent status " movie , following the anthropologist Ralph Linton . All of us play many parts or roles in life , but not all at the same time . The status we assume at any given moment is our active status , but we have many latent ones to draw on . A man may be a " husband " at breakfast , a " fireman " at work , and a " fellow passenger " on the subway . In films like this , the hero may be compassionate , clever , courageous , and a master of some craft , but he doesn't reveal this latent status until near the end . Power assumes the active status of " fop " except when he becomes Zorro . Destry acts the fool until he displays his mastery of guns . Doctor Richard Kimball in " The Fugitive " is only rarely a " doctor . " The audience is always let in on the existence of the hero's latent status . It's an effective skeleton for a story . It MUST be , because it's used so often .
442806	819382	363163	8.0	Unforgettable	I tuned in late to this film , not expected very much , because we have all I suppose seen so many documentaries of Hitler's last days in the bunker , and a reconstruction with Alec Guiness thrown in for good measure . Many of these presentations depend on interviews with Trudl Junge , Hitler's secretary at the time . Her descriptions of the goings on during the final days are cool , precise , and dispassionate . First Hitler said this , then Eva Braun said that , and then they went up into the garden . A human surveillance camera who seems to have no personal mechanism for judgments . She was , however , quite human after all . The last shot of the film is from an interview with her before her death in 2002 . She explains to us that , young as she was , she had always put aside any feeling of guilt for her involvement in the Third Reich , negligible as it was . But then , one day , she passed a monument to Sophie Scholl who sacrificed herself in the course of resisting Naziism , and Frau Junge tells the camera - - and the rest of the world - - that she realized at that moment that youth and naiveté could no longer serve as her excuse . I missed the first half hour or so , but I stayed for the rest . This is an extremely powerful movie . The events in the bunker are keenly observed . There is virtually nothing in the way of sentiment or dramatic displays . If the director , Hirschbiegel , wants two officers to commit suicide he may have them walk into a room and close the door behind them , then allow us to hear two shots a bit later . No one talks about despair . Instead , the officers and some of the ladies sit around a table in one of the bunker's rooms and get drunk as skunks . This is a tragic ending to an insane war , and it is all enacted by human beings , not demons . Goebbels and his wife have 5 beautiful young children , a boy and four girls . They deliberately give them knockout drops , then Frau Goebbels puts a capsule of fast-acting poison in each of their mouths , one after another , and crunches the capsule by pressing each child's teeth together . Then , wordlessly , Goebbels and his wife walk up into the open where , still wordlessly , he shoots her and then himself - - off camera . The soldiers who have been waiting impatiently for this ritual to end , then scurry forward with cans of gasoline to dispose of the bodies . The episode is impossible to watch without being moved . What have Goebbels and his wife died for ? What did their children , who knew nothing of war or racism , die for ? And , implicitly , the film asks , what did some 50 million people die for between 1939 and 1945 ? I am grateful to the director and the actors for keeping things so matter of fact . Preparations for a predictable death are pretty gruesome even with the most tasteful intentions , and too often executions and suicides seem to have the filmmakers ' attention lavished on them for not much reason other than to pander to a morbid interest in watching someone else die , a kind of arousal jag . How easy it would have been for a trashy sensibility to give us the death of Hitler's German shepherd , Blondi , in all its horror . A DOG yet ! Those of us who might have cheered at Hitler's death would now have a chance to weep over Blondi's . Instead , except for a few instructive inserts , Blondi's poisoning is only glimpsed in a clumsy shot through an open doorway . Congratulations to everyone involved in this production . They've given us a well-executed film , made for adults . They come along so rarely .
441635	819382	98621	8.0	Marital Blitz	Give Danny DeVito the right story and he clicks . He does it here . What do a tornado , a hurricane , and an ex-wife have in common ? They all get the house . Except when the husband's lawyer manages to dig up some rule that allows the husband to stay in the house as long as he and his wife lead separate lives . The husband is Douglas , the wife is Turner , and the lawyer and mediator is DeVito . There's also a housekeeper and two not especially lovable children ( thank heavens for small favors ) but they're probably less important than the husband's dog and the wife's cat . So how do two rich yuppies lead separate lives in their mansion ? Simple . First they ignore and curse each other while passing on the stairs . " Filthy slut , " mutters Douglas . " Bastard , " murmurs Turner . Finally Douglas proudly shows DeVito a plan that he has worked out with Turner . It is a blueprint of the house , divided into red , green , and yellow sections . Douglas explains that the red sections belong to him , the green sections are hers , and the yellow rooms are neutral . " I had a little trouble with the kitchen , " he says , " but we worked out alternative hours . " DeVito is aghast . " This seems - - RATIONAL to you ? " Douglas : " I'm gonna win this . " DeVito : " Oliver , nobody WINS anything here . There are only degrees of losing . " And Douglas leans forward conspiratorially , grins insanely , and whispers : " I got MORE SQUARE FOOTAGE . " It's Douglas's best performance , I think . He's not a simple outraged bourgeois , as in " Fatal Attraction " or " Basic Flaw " or whatever it was . And his character has more dimensions than his Gordon Gekko , and almost as good a name . The couple eat at opposite ends of a long empty table , like Charles Foster Kane and Emily . Douglas is waiting for an important phone call and is a bit anxious . He pays no attention to his wife sitting motionless and silently , staring at him . He stabs at the food on his plate and slices it viciously . And watch the half-demonic expressions that play across his face as he attacks and eats his food . The scene is an almost perfect embodiment of black comedy because , in context , it is outrageously funny - - but it could have been yanked straight out of a horror movie without changing a thing . It's a fine script and DeVito does well by it . I guess it gets a little tiresome by the time they're chasing one another around the darkened half-ruined mansion , nailing boards over windows and unloosening nuts , and throwing plates . And when in the midst of their hatred , Turner serves the pleasantly surprised Douglas her superlative pate and then claims it was made of Benny's liver , I could have done without the quick shot of the living Benny in the bushes outside . But those are relatively small things bracketed in a very funny movie . There is a crazy logic to the story too . The couple begin by loving one another but are then separated by , well , THINGS . Douglas works very hard to make enough money so that his wife can find and furnish a perfect home for him . A little tritely , Turner discovers that she has grown not only to dislike the distracted Douglas but to hate him , so she wants her independence . Initially , the little frictions are minor . With a table full of dinner guests that Douglas is trying to impress , he asks Turner to explain how they happened to acquire the Baccarat wine glasses they're using . Nervously , she begins with a trip to Paris but so many dependent clauses intrude themselves that her narrative begins to resemble a 19th-century German sentence . So Douglas cuts her off : " To make a long story short . . . . . " , and wraps it up in two declaratives . ( I can't emphasize too strongly how deftly DeVito handles this scene . Absolutely none of the irritation is spelled out except by the actors and the camera and editing , and yet we are left with a full understanding of the little disaster that's just taken place and the empty anger that follows . ) The gathering enmity shows up in tiny ways . " I just wanted to push you , " Douglas says to his wife's back , trying to explain some rudeness . " After all , everybody needs a little PUSH once in a while . " ( He picks up her cat and flings it aside . ) And after his big dinner with his superiors , the couple are in bed and Douglas worries a little . " I hope they didn't notice what a jerk I was . " Turner : " They never seem to . " Douglas is so smug that the barb sails completely over his head . It's like Neal Simon , if Simon had become delicate . The humor , if that's what it is , grows more physical and in some ways less funny . Douglas , drunk , urinates on some fish while Turner is giving HER big dinner for potential customers . In turn , while the assembled guests watch open-mouthed from the doorway , she revs up her two-million horsepower SUV with the big knobby tires and the 20 mm cannon on top and noisily smashes into his tiny classic Morgan convertible . Then she backs up and drives completely over it with Douglas inside . Douglas emerges shakily from the compressed car and says , sounding perfectly reasonable , " Look , I don't want to create a scene . I mean , I live in this neighborhood too . " See this movie if you have a chance . I would recommend it even if it weren't so good , simply on the basis of the last scene between the Roses . They have fallen 30 feet on a chandelier and lie dying next to one another . With his last bit of energy , Douglas manages to move his hand lovingly on her shoulder . And just before she dies , without being able to look at what she's doing , Turner reaches slowly out , puts her hand over his , and flips it away .
442819	819382	642376	8.0	The Shoe Groupie	It may sound crazy to argue that this is one of the funniest episodes in this or any other series and , at the same time , that there is an underlying theme of pathos , but it's true . Well - - Charlie Chaplin managed to do it once in a while , and Billy Wilder . Why shouldn't a couple of sitcom writers trip over the same splendid alembic ? Al comes home from work with a big smile and reveals that a shoe groupie has been patronizing his store daily . Peggy is jealous and orders the two kids , Bud and Kelly , to hide in the store and spy on him all day . Al arrives and , while his kids peep at him , he throws his jacket aside , takes a deep breath , spreads his arms expansively , and declares , " Open for business ! " Then he sits on a foot stool in the empty store , buries his face in his hands , and doesn't move a muscle for five hours . A fat lady puts a momentary end to his despair by giving him a chance to rebut her claim that the shoes she bought yesterday are cheap because they split at the seams . They're like an elevator , Al explains , there's a two-ton wait limit . How about if I nail them to the soles of your feet ? That will give you more traction in front of the ice wagon . Then the groupie enters , and she's a meal in a short skirt . She's brought a tray of muffins for Al and begs him breathlessly to tell her stories about shoes . Half way through a story , she moans , " Don't stop now . " Bud and Kelly are uncertain about telling Peggy . When Peggy demands to know what went on , Bud looks thoughtful and ponders the problem . We hear his voice over as he turns things over in his mind , then thinks : " I wonder what Kelly's thinking . " The camera pans to Kelly's giddy face and we hear HER voice over - - a cartoon voice sputtering , " Cheery beery jelly bean , Bullwinkle . " Bud finally tells Peggy that nothing happened . Al sat there for hours , then a fat lady came in , and that was all . " Yeah , " adds Kelly , " and then a beautiful woman came in and Daddy ate her muffins . " I won't go on with this , I don't think , because the second half doesn't have the ontological significance of the first , and because I don't want to spoil any more gags , but it's significant that when Al gets home , Peggy demands to know what happened . " What happened ? Oh , I graduated from high school , lost the will to live , and here I am . " A classic episode with , perhaps unwittingly , a darker undertone that doesn't for a moment make it any less hilarious .
442085	819382	58385	8.0	" Lavish , Lavisher , Lavishest . "	You have to keep your eyes open when a monster musical rumbles in your direction . You're liable to be demolished by a " Dr . Doolittle " or smothered in sugar by a " Sound of Music " with its " lark that is learning to pray . " " My Fair Lady " is as big and expensive as any of them , but it deserves nothing but applause . The plot is taken directly from George Bernard Shaw's most entertaining play , " Pygmalion , " which was in turn ripped off from the Greek myth of Pygmalion and Galatea . The late 30s version with Wendy Hiller was fine in its own right . The latest version adds tunes by Loewe and screenplay by Lerner and it's their most memorable work . Lerner and Loewe were a famous team but wrote some clunkers - - " If I were a bell I'd go DING DONG DING DONG DING . " Not here . The tunes aren't only not sappy but are both functional in advancing the plot and sometimes keenly witty . In " Why Can't a Woman Be More Like a Man ? " , Rex Harrison as Professor Higgins , annoyed by Eliza Doolittle's emotionalism , queries Colonel Pickering ( Wilfrid Hyde-White ) . " If I forgot your silly birthday would you fuss ? " Pickering's offhand reply : " Nonsense ! " Higgins : " Then why can't a woman be more like - - US ? " See the feminist linguist Deborah Tannen for a further discussion of such gender-related issues . Rex Harrison is at his best as the down-to-earth , irascible phoneticist who is able to trace an Englishman's personal history through his speech , sometimes pinning his place of origin down to a few blocks . Probably in England at the time it could be done . Now it would be much more difficult in England or anywhere else , with what's been called " broadcast English " becoming the norm and with families moving around too often to acquire a regional dialect . It can still be done , though , with sensitive enough ears and a knowledge of the English class system , which is more marked than the American . Harrison does his own singing - - of a sort called " Sprechtgesang " I think - - which involves speaking or shouting the words while only hinting at the melody behind them . So does Hyde-White . The others are dubbed effectively . Audrey Hepburn was a dancer , not a singer . The set design by Cecil Beaton is outlandish and peculiarly apt . The sets are highly stylized , mostly black and white except for Higgins ' earth tones . Fashion mavens will gush themselves to death over the women's wardrobe . What colossal hats ! Not just huge in and of themselves but adorned with long feathers , pom poms , imposing flowers , and cuckoo clocks for all I know . Just note the lid on Hepburn at the races when she reverts to type and shouts out that taboo word in her gutter dialect . That's probably the funniest scene in the film , by the way , and much of it depends on Hepburn . She delivers the goods until that catastrophic imprecation . She is required to do less , but does it with equal success , at the ambassador's ball , where she is done up in a coif that resembles a crest on the helmet of a Greek warrior . Ugly as hell , if you ask me . I prefer musicals with a lot of dancing . I find the motion exhilarating . Makes my hair stand on end if it's done well . Most people can carry a tune , but how many can do Donald O'Connor's off-the-wall number in " Singin ' in the Rain " ? " My Fair Lady " has no dance solos at all , but that doesn't detract from its appeal . It's a nice job by everyone concerned . Not a single dud among the elements .
443387	819382	43075	8.0	Brutal Moralistic Crime Drama	Frank Lovejoy is a veteran who never was sent overseas during the war . He can't find a job to support his wife ( Kathleen Ryan ) and little boy . Angry , embittered , and perhaps a little guilty , he falls in with bad guy Lloyd Bridges who sport platinum cuff links and seems to be enjoying himself all over the little California town . Bridges offers Lovejoy a job as his wheel man . Just a couple of minor stick-ups , nothing serious . But the robberies escalate into the kidnapping of a college boy from a rich family . Bridges , an envious psychopath , kills the kid out of spite . Both Bridges and Lovejoy are caught and jailed but several thousand people break into the jail , beat the men , and pass them outside overhead like serving platters where they meet vigilante justice . I haven't seen it since I was a kid but the memory of that climactic collective murder still makes me wince . It's impossible to comment on the performances , or on much else for that matter , after the passage of so many years but unless my brain has turned to tofu , I'm compelled to recommend the film . It was made at the height of the anti-Red hysteria in Hollywood , a time when subliminal pro-communist messages were being read into cinematic trifles . And the advertising campaign that accompanied this release seemed almost to goad the audience into mindless mob action . Get in on the ground floor of the explosive rage for justice ! That sort of thing . In other words , hang the Reds . It was completely at odds with the message of the movie itself , which was that ordinary guys can get sucked up by circumstances and find themselves suffering the same fate as those who are truly evil . Oh - - and mobs can be dangerous . ( If you're a social psychologist , think " risky shift " . ) Out of all the simple black-and-white crime melodramas that appeared in the post-war period , this is one of the few that had me by the lapels . Based on a real incident in 1930s San Jose , California . If it shows up , be sure to catch it .
442813	819382	37988	8.0	Fleeting Time Thou Hast Left Me Old .	I've seen this recently for only the second time and found it as impressive as it was the first time round . That's especially surprising considering the screenwriter and director , Albert Lewin , never considered one of Hollywood's golden boys . Yet he does a good and efficient job here . The direction lacks unnecessary razzle dazzle ( excepting a couple of technicolor inserts ) and is not only functional but sometimes subtle and expressive . I couldn't count the number of times a scene ends with that evil Egyptian cat goddess , representing the devil to whom Dorian Gray has sold his soul , framed in the foreground or lurking blurred in the shadows . The photography is by Harry Stradling and it too is exceptional , making good use of oil lamps , candles , and murk . I haven't read the novel in years and can't really tell how closely the film adheres to the original . I do remember snickering at Wilde's depiction of some examples of Dorian Gray's debauchery - - collecting gems and viewing overly decorative Oriental art , that sort of thing . Wilde surely knew more about debauchery than he was telling us but , Victorian England being what it was , could only gloss it over with these peccadilloes . Yes , Dorian Gray was debauched . He had bad taste . I don't recall any murder from the novella but Lewin the screenwriter has got one in this movie . I suppose the story is well enough known . An innocent very handsome young man ( Hurd Hatfield ) has his portrait painted by Basil Hallward ( Lowell Gillmore ) . Under the influence of the witty , cynical , and shallow Lord Wotten ( George Sanders ) , Hatfield tests the young singer he intends to marry ( a young , pretty Angela Lansbury ) and drives her to suicide . Thereafter he does nothing but pursue pleasure . He doesn't collect stones or get hot over exotic sculpture in the movie , but he visits louche places with names like Whitechapel ( Jack the Ripper country around this period ) and Bluegate Fields , where , it's hinted , he uses opium and frolics with women of low morals . One of the filthy doors to the stairs of the cathouse is opened by a midget . That's the kind of unusual touch that makes Lewin's direction as impressive as it is . Not that this production drags at all , but to make a long story short , the now hidden portrait turns really ugly over the course of twenty years while Dorian Gray remains as youthful and handsome as ever . So does Dorian's selfishness and he winds up murdering Basil Hallward to keep the changing portrait a secret . Then he blackmails an ex-friend ( by this time he has nothing BUT ex-friends ) into disposing of the body , after which the ex-friend commits suicide . The portrait by this time is bathed in blood . Hatfield is about to marry the innocent niece of the painter but , disgusted with himself , begins to destroy the portrait , only to die himself and turn into a physical wreck while the picture reverts to its original beauty of form . The story itself isn't as tightly written as it might be . George Sanders occupies a lot of screen time in the first half and throws all these Wildeian apothegms around as if they were going out of style , but then disappears for most of the remaining time . Hurd Hatfield looks perfect as Dorian Gray . He was my co-star in " Crimes of the Heart " . Hatfield , that is , not Gray . That's a pretty long , if not very distinguished , career for a Hollywood type . His face here isn't very expressive . It seems marmoreal , stony , and it's probably a misjudgment on someone's part because you can't really tell the difference between the innocent Dorian Gray and the debauched . What I mean is , couldn't he remain gorgeous but just scowl a little more during his moral decline ? Nobody could do " cad " better than George Sanders and his presence is always welcome . Angela Lansbury is a peach too and , as Sibyl Vane , she sings a cute music hall ditty , " The Yellow Bird . " Dorian Gray has a habit of banging out on a piano a maniacal Chopin prelude that is to the ears what a thunderstorm criss-crossed by streaks of lightning is to the eyes . Peter Lawford has a minor role and Donna Reed has an uncomplicated part . Hatfield adopts an English accent but Reed doesn't bother . There is a helpful and informative narration by Sir Cedric Hardwicke . All in all , a rather nice job by everyone concerned . Except maybe the editor . Some important characters appear late in the show and we don't know them .
443021	819382	37954	8.0	Good Example of the Genre	A good example of a Warner Brothers war drama , it's full of clichés appropriate to the times . The Japanese are " moral idiots , " " savages , " and " monkeys " ( three times ) . Men shout and wave at a search plane two or three miles away ( three times ) . The men are the usual congeries of ethnicity - - " Gabby " Gordon hollers " Mazeltov " at the departing Sweeney . ( Hold on a moment . I'll have to think that one over . I'll also have to figure out how Lt . Sidney Jacobs acquired a Catholic dog tag . ) Franz Waxman's music is just catchy enough , without being in the least distinguished . The jungle looks like a dressed-up Santa Anita with eucalyptus trees instead of ebony . The dialogue tends to run along lines like - - " Here we are in the muck and mire . " " Hi , Muck ! " " Hi , Mire ! " Just at the end , when the remaining handful of paratroopers are in despair , the cavalry comes riding to the rescue . I guess that gets the time-trapped stuff out of the way . This is far from an insulting cartoon of a movie . At its best , it captures the kind of utter physical exhaustion that Norman Mailer caught in his novel , " The Naked and the Dead . " It's essentially a " journey " movie . Flynn , who is not bad , and his men are parachuted into Burma to destroy a radar station . Mission accomplished without casualties , they find their pick-up airfield swarming with enemy soldiers and must slog their way out through swamps and over mountains , the trip punctuated by bloody encounters with the Japanese . Not that the battles are literally bloody . I don't think a drop of blood is spilled in the entire movie despite multiple opportunities . " Saving Private Ryan " is one way to tell a horrifying story - - very explicitly - - but the suggestion that is used in this film is equally effective , as hard as that may be to believe . Maybe the most jarring and moving moment in the film is when Flynn's group finds their friends tortured and killed by the Japanese . Flynn's friend , Jacobs , is barely alive . We see only his legs as Flynn kneels over him and identifies himself . The viewer can only imagine what Jacob's face - - and his eyes - - must look like as he whispers , " Nelson ? Is that you , Nelson ? Will you do me a favor , Nelson ? Kill me ? " The movie is a long one but it really needs to be long or we wouldn't so readily feel the agony and the desperation of these dying men . It's long enough for us to get to know the men as more than just anonymous soldiers too . And the dialogue has its redeeming moments . When the middle-aged journalist is found dead near his foxhole , a supporting player , James Brown , stands over the body and says sincerely but not overdramatically , " Gee , I'm sorry , Mister Williams . Awfully sorry . " And when Flynn leads his pitiful group of survivors finally into the base , his commanding officer shakes his hand , gives him a light , and tells him , " You don't know how important it was for you to take that radar station . " Flynn says simply , " Here's what it cost , " and hands him a fistful of identity tags . It's an example not of art but of Hollywood craftsmanship . Engaging , and nicely done .
442334	819382	79182	8.0	Iwao : Portrait of a Serial Murderer .	Yes , the Japanese can have serial killers too , and they can make movies about them , and this is one powerful movie . In its technique , it comes closer to " Henry : Portrait of a Serial Killer " in its episodic and somewhat rambling narrative than to any of the dozens of other American junk being ground out about Ed Gein the Butcher or " Ted Bundy . " The serial murderer , a real one , is Iwao Inokizu , played with intensity and charm by Ken Ogata , who passed away a few months ago . There are some discontinuities in the narrative that may make this rather long story a little hard to follow , perhaps especially for Westerners . Iwao's first two murders are both pointless and bloody . Of the remaining three , only one takes place on screen and is relatively brief . And the story is told in flashbacks , with sudden shifts from place to place , and only a handful of characters to serve as anchors in time and space . Man , have the writers got Antisocial Personality Disorder down pat . They illustrate the condition as well as Iwao exemplified it . Iwao kills people - - five all together , matching Jack the Ripper - - for virtually no reason . He poses as a lawyer or a distinguished professor . He moves from city to city relentlessly and cons people out of money with his authoritative charm . The movie is mature . It's made for grown-ups , not children . And not because of any sensationalism . That would be targeting thrill-starved teens of today . But rather because of the absence of sensationalism . It's hard to describe a film about a serial killer as showing a sense of taste but this one does . When Iwao forms a bond with an elderly woman whom he considers his " prison buddy " because she's been in jail , he decides to strangle her . When she walks unwittingly into a darkened room , we see him enter behind her with a rope . And that's it . Cut . It reminds me of the scene in Val Lewton's " The Body Snatchers " when the young girl who sings carols is murdered off screen . Iwao's family were devout Catholics , so much so that when Iwao's father develops impure thoughts about Iwao's wife he asks to be excommunicated . And the family insist that before Iwao is married , his bride convert from Buddhism . This came as a bit of a surprise because in much of Japan religion , although taken seriously , isn't so readily and so intensely divided into sects and denominations . A Shinto shrine at home is in no way incompatible with a Christian wedding and a Buddhist funeral ceremony . There is a scene at the end in which Iwao's father and the daughter-in-law whom he loves , and who loves him , dispose of Iwao's bones after the hanging by flinging them from an isolated hill top . The bones seem to freeze in mid-air . I take this to be not director Imamura's endorsement of anything supernatural , just the symbolic perceptions of Iwao's family . He was so thoroughly rotten , and blood is blood , that it's not easy to get rid of him even after he's dead . The scene is probably more easily understood in Japan , where family honor and shame are considerations to be seriously reckoned with . It's a lengthy film and at times a little confusing , but it packs a real wallop .
442259	819382	62138	8.0	A genre movie unlike any other .	When I worked in a psychiatric hospital I noticed that one or two of the patients had a peculiar tendency to stand up , start walking purposefully across the ward , stop and look around , then begin walking just as purposefully in another direction , then sit down again . A kind of ambulatory non sequitur . This whole movie is like that . I mean that to be a compliment . People break up the interactive script they've initiated and do something completely unpredictable . I'll just give one example . Walker ( Marvin ) and his companion ( Angie Dickenson ) have an argument and she begins whacking him across the head with her purse . At first he guards himself with his arms but then lowers them and stands silently and without any expression as she beats him , slaps him , and pounds his chest , finally slumping to the floor exhausted . At that , he strides wordlessly to the couch , plops down , turns on the TV and begins surfing the channels . It's a neo-noir film if there ever was one . There is betrayal , a false woman , suicide , multiple double crosses , revenge , an urban setting , and an ambiguous ending . So , although it is a genre film , it is nevertheless unique . Everything comes together . The production designer gives us sterile urban vistas , featuring bland cement boxes and the Los Angeles River , without which no noir would be complete . The apartments these people live in look like ordinary arid gray middle-class bourgeois digs . Wardrobe , too , has fitted these performers out in ordinary suits and ties , and the women are always rather chic looking . The direction and editing are splendid . I'll give an example of what I mean here , too . Lee Marvin throws John Vernon out on the roof of his penthouse , wrapped only in a bed sheet . Vernon begins to tumble over the edge , Marvin grabs for him but winds up holding only the sheet while Vernon plunges some dozen floors to the street below . ( His body winds up impossibly intact . A cat might have survived such a fall but a full-grown man would have splashed . ) In an ordinary movie , we'd get a cut from the body hitting the street to Marvin staring down at it over the railing . But here , Marvin is still holding the sheet . Not only that but it's WINDY on the fourteenth floor roof and the wind is whipping the sheet up into billows around Marvin , like some demonic object with its own malevolent life force , before he is finally able to unwrap himself and fling it away . The editing gives us a couple of brief flashbacks , but not just to evoke a mood . They are instrumental in letting us know what Marvin is thinking . Marvin is holding a gun to his ex-pal's , Vernon's , face and the poor guy faints until Marvin slaps him awake , and then he begs Marvin to trust him . A flashback lasting only a few seconds reminds us of an earlier scene in which Vernon begged Marvin's help in carrying out a heist and shouted at him , " Walker ! Trust me ! " The editing is so precise that in this - - and in a dozen other scenes - - a few seconds more or less would drain them of their impact . The score is by Johnny Mandel , an arranger and composer whose work I've admired for years . He was a child prodigy , played both trumpet and trombone with Tommy Dorsey's band before turning to composing and arranging . He's never edgy or irritating . His music is smooth and melodic and sometimes strangely orchestrated . Here he suits his talents to the demands of the scene . When a man is trying to seduce a woman , a romantic piano melody tinkles behind them . At other times , again depending on the context , the score glides from Henry Mancini to Gil Evans . Nicely done . So is the acting . Marvin has been this good in other films but never better . The plot has to do with his regaining $93 , 000 that " the organization " has cheated him out of . ( There is no mafia-ness to the movie . The only foreign language we hear is Portugese . ) And $93K was a lot of money then . You could find gas at 29 cents a gallon . Marvin more or less kills his way up the ladder searching for someone in a position to " pay me my money . " He finally gets to Carrol O'Connor who explains to him that in a huge corporation like this , nobody ever handles any money . O'Connor has got maybe eleven dollars in his wallet . And Marvin , holding a gun on him , hesitates and looks genuinely put out - - puzzled , the way a child might be puzzled by a disappointing reply . ( " No , there's no Santa Claus . " ) I think I'll leave it at that before I run out of space . I've pretty much skipped the plot but that must be adequately covered elsewhere . Besides , the plot is either extremely simple or very complicated indeed , depending on how far you want your conjectures to dig . ( Is the whole movie nothing more than the fantasy of Marvin as he lies dying on Alcatraz after being shot at the beginning of the story ? See what I mean ? ) Don't miss it .
442268	819382	379889	8.0	Hate , not money , makes the world go round .	This is a tough play to put on for a couple of reasons . First and foremost there's the issue of anti-Semitism , any discussion of which really belongs elsewhere . It's amazing how closely Shakespeare's Shylock resembles the modern stereotype - - greedy , clannish , proud , angry - - especially considering that the author probably never met a Jew in his life . But Shakespeare has given Shylock more than just one bundle of related dimensions . Shylock loses just about everything - - his daughter , his money , his dignity , and his faith . And he's kicked about like a soccer ball wherever he goes . People spit on his gabardines from time to time . Al Pacino , the Italian from New York City , does a splendid job with the character . I was really surprised . Serpico pulls off an entirely different role . I wonder how Jackie Mason might have handled it . " Oy , mine Jessica ron off vit a SHAYGETZ ! " Pacino has figured out his character with considerable precision , which is really difficult because the role is highly textured and ambiguous . Pacino gives him a slight accent which can be taken to be Middle Eastern , but it's not just the technical stuff that makes his performance so good . Shakespeare is hard to understand because some of his lexicon is dated ( " nice , " " fond " ) and the language kind of straddles Middle English and Modern English . And then there is Shakespeare's innovative , not to say wanton , way with words - - a noun becomes a verb at the snap of his fingers ( " her beauty beggars all description " ) . To help us understand the dialog better , the director and Pacino have put the pauses in the right place . If Shylock has a long perfumed speech about his reasons for demanding his pound of flesh , he will stop at the door while stomping out , turn around silently , hold up a piece of paper , and finally say emphatically and deliberately , " I have my bond . " That's the point of the whole flowery speech that precedes the statement . " I have my bond . " So it doesn't matter all that much if you've been unable to follow his reasoning exactly . Pacino sums it all up for you in one sentence . Lynn Collins is luminously gorgeous and easy to understand . I thought for a while that I was watching Kate Blanchett . Jeremy Irons is believable but , I don't know , melancholic . He's a great actor , I think , but I'd rather see him in roles incorporation more irony , so to speak , like Humbert Humbert or Klaus von Bulow . Out of curiosity I once asked an old German gentleman , a tradesman who had grown up in a small village in what was then Austria-Hungary just before the turn of the last century , if there had been any Jews in his community . Oh , yes . They were moneylenders . I girded my loins and plunged on . I wonder why they were the moneylenders ? The old guy looked at me as if I were an idiot and said , " They were the only people in the village you could TRUST . " This is quite a good movie . There is some silliness involving rings that come across as anticlimactic after Shylock's reduction . " I am content , " says Shylock before he leaves , penniless , familyless , revengeless , dignityless . I don't think he was really content . I expect he did what a lot of people in his position did at the time in Europe . He went about like everyone else and practiced his religion underground . And why not ? It was good enough for the Christians under Nero . See this if you can . It isn't likely that you'll feel you've explained all the ambiguity afterward .
442280	819382	38120	8.0	Moving Picture	Spoilers . When I saw this years ago it struck me as not having enough battle scenes in it . Now with my blood testosterone leveling off I think I have a better handle on it . Most war movies of the period seemed to include three elements whenever possible : combat , romance , and banter between battles . This one has all of them , although the romance has to be squeezed in with a shoehorn . The banter is sometimes funny . A handful of soldiers are sitting around in a cramped , miserably wet shelter dug out of the rock . One removes his boots . One by one the others quietly sniff and throw suspicious glances at one another . Ernie Pyle , crouched there fully dressed , looks back at the others and says , " It wasn't me . " ( Nothing to do with boots ! ) There is also a certain corny sort of sentimentality associated with at least one of the characters , a beat-up exhausted non-com who tries repeatedly and without success to play a home-made record from his son . ( First time I remember seeing a scene like that was in " Destination Tokyo . " ) I was sure the record would be played for every tear it was worth after the father's death , but that's not what happens at all . There is only one real scene of combat and it's well done . Howard Hawks may have seen it before making " El Dorado . " Mitchum does a journeyman job as Captain Walker , tough and humane as all company commanders in these movies usually are . Yet , he's so good , particularly in a scene alone with Pyle on Christmas Eve , that he brings more to the part than the minimal requirements . Burgess Meredith as Pyle is equally good . He can rattle the rafters when he overacts , but he doesn't do it here . He's quietly believable as a humble war correspondent more concerned with writing about the guy in the mud than about the generals . " The G . I . , " he ruminates , " He lives so miserable . He dies so miserable . " Ernie Pyle wasn't a great writer . He didn't have the ego for it . He left that up to more florid artists , like Hemingway , who described in one of his articles how he had to take over command of a landing craft at Normandy from a green officer in order to make sure it landed in the right place . Or Walter Cronkite , who could use a leader on a story like , " I Just Returned From a Mission to Hell . " But if Pyle was no literary artist , he wasn't a dismissible hack either , especially when his circumstances are taken into account . A hack might write something like , " The shells roared overhead like freight trains . " Pyle wrote : " Artillery shells rustled overhead . " ( " Rustled . " ) The poor unpretentious Pulitzer prize winner took a bullet in the forehead on Ie Shima , in the Pacific . And Captain Walker is killed too . Not dramatically , nor heroically , but offscreen , just another body being brought in by mule , already in rigor . The scene is played on screen exactly as Pyle wrote it , with some of the men coming to Walker's body , staring at it before moving on , one or two of them telling Walker how sorry they are . No one sheds a tear . This is a man they liked and respected , but they've already seen so many dead bodies . It's a scene that can't help moving a viewer . The men then shuffle off in silhouette over to the top of a dark , brooding hill , with no triumphant military music to accompany them . It is a striking image of the futility of war . And it ought to be . The Italian campaign which is followed in this film was a disaster . The peninsula , the boot of Italy , has mountains that resemble the skeleton of a fish , with multiple hills running east and west out of the spine of the Apennines . Nobody could design better defensive terrain if they tried , and the Germans were very good . The allies , represented not just by Americans and Brits , but by French , New Zealanders , Gurkhas , Poles , and Canadians , gained nothing worthwhile . In the initial invasion they tried to outflank the enemy with an amphibious landing behind their lines . It failed . The allies slogged on through terrible weather to the next formidable line where they were stopped . They tried to outflank the enemy with an amphibious landing behind their lines . It failed . At the Gustav Line , the Allied advance was stopped at the foot of Monte Cassino , a thousand-year-old Benedictine monastery , which we mistakenly believed was being used as an artillery observation post . We finally bombed the monastery to smithereens , and after the dust settled the Germans immediately moved into the rubble and used it as an observation post . When , finally , it seemed we had gotten behind the German lines , instead of forging west and trapping their troops , the general in charge of the Fifth Army turned north instead and raced towards the open city of Rome so he could have the honor of being the first to enter it . And so it went . Some of this tragedy was captured on film by John Huston in " The Battle of San Pietro , " which went through some problems because it showed dead American soldiers instead of just dead German soldiers . But none of this could appear , except by implication , in " The Story of G . I . Joe . " However , the final scene is suitably bleak . It might be Death himself leading that dance over the top of the hill .
442089	819382	389557	8.0	Excellent film about Dutch resistance .	Says my TV guide , " In World War II Holland , a woman of the Jewish resistance falls in love with the German officer she was sent to seduce . " That makes it sound like another sappy love story . We visualize the scene in which the luscious babe holds a trembling pistol against the head of her sleeping Nazi lover , her face a mask of anguish . " Do I love him too much to kill him " ? Actually , it's much more than that , a bitter and adult story of intrigue and betrayal among the Dutch resistance during the German occupation . Paul Verhoeven directed not only this highly European film but a number of American action movies as well , and he learned his commercial lessons in Hollywood , but he hasn't imported them to his native Holland . This isn't " Robocop " or a Schwarzenegger Schlagfest by any means . Lots of nudity , yes , but mostly non-erotic - - and male as well as female . Sharon Stone may open her knees and cross her legs while half a dozen men goggle and lick their lips . Here , Clarice Van Houten bleaches her pubic hair on screen and nothing is made of it except that she is Jewish , has black hair , and is trying to make herself blond all over so as not to be found out . What horror . And it doesn't follow the usual trajectory , with a climactic shoot out at the end . Most of the good guys die before the end , except the ones who most deserve it . The German officer with whom Clarice falls in love ( Jobst Schnibbe ) is a fundamentally decent guy who , seeing the war's end , tries to prevent more bloodshed by arranging a truce with the Resistance . These kinds of stories generally call for him to die a heroic , self-sacrificing death , maybe in order to save the girl's life . But it doesn't happen . He dies alright , but only because he's caught , mistaken for a Nazi , and the Canadians who liberate the city permit a cooperative but still fascistic German to carry out the death sentence that has been imposed on Schnibbe . It's not a heroic death . Schnibbe is simply stood up against a stone wall and shot . If there's a problem with the film , it may be that Verhoeven has learned a little too much from Hollywood . The end of the war , and the liberation of Amsterdam by the British and Canadians , is followed by a lengthy story of mistaken intentions and Allied gloating that lead not just to Schnibbe's death but to the incarceration and humiliation of Clarice by a drunken Dutch rabble . I mean - - they dump a cauldron of human excrement on her , and the scene is drawn out until long after we've grasped the point . And there's a great deal of gun play . It seems to go on and on , while automatic weapons tear bodies apart . But this is no more a dumb action movie than it is a simple-minded love story . If it has its commercial elements , it at least is ambitious enough to reach for an audience of grown-ups who can understand the complexity of motives and of human nature . Every once in a while , during a pause in the narrative , I thought of Anne Frank and her family and friends , most of whom lived in Holland and died before the end of the war - - and of Audrey Hepburn too , who managed to live through it .
442102	819382	41546	9.0	" You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style . "	There's more than a touch of Oscar Wilde in this film . There is irony and elegant decadence , both in the visuals and in the script . The narrator , Louis Mazzini ( Price ) , has murdered several people who stand between him and the title to which he feels entitled . Invited to go on a hunt with one of his victims-to-be he agrees to stroll along but refuses to carry a shotgun because he is opposed to blood sports . The protagonist is supercilious , snotty , and a complete egotist who is happy that one of his benefactors dies a natural death since it makes it unnecessary to kill him . It's so uncomfortable to murder someone with whom one has not had disagreements . What also strikes me is the resemblance to Vladimir Nabokov's " Lolita " , both in its structure and execution . Of course the movie lacks all of Nabokov's poetry ( " Light of my life . Fire of my loins " ) but so does everything else ever written . Yet there are some isomorphic qualities in " Kind Hearts and Coronets , " aside from the elegant irony and the snobbishness of the narrator . Humbert Humbert is guilty not just of killing Quilty but of ruining the youth of an adolescent girl and he comments on his own perversity with the kind of distant amusement that Price's narrator does . Price's own debaucheries amuses him . At a wedding , he congratulates the groom whose virginal bride he seduced the evening before : " You're a lucky man . Take my word for it . " And , like Humbert , he feels nothing but contempt for people with " suburban ways " . He's fastidious in his wardrobe and grooming . And if Humbert's love for Lolita was real , it was rarely expressed without being undercut by irony . ( " I was a pentapod monster . " ) Similarly , Price has one real engine driving him - - a genuine desire to revenge the humiliation and death of his beloved mother - - although it's only brought up seriously once or twice . Both Price , as Mazzini , and Humbert Humbert are always showing off and quoting poetry . ( Price's final quote , " How happy could I be with either , Were t ' other dear charmer away ! " is from Gay's " The Beggar's Opera . " ) The movie is extremely funny . The acting is superb all around , with Guiness being the splashiest performer in his five roles . But Price could not be improved upon . The way he manhandles his drunken rival Lionel , throwing him to the floor , then brushing his hands as if they'd been dirtied . And his improvised sample of the Matabele language ( " colloquial rendering of course " ) . The director has all of this down just pat . It's a very British movie . The understatement is almost overstated . Only two of the murdered people die on screen - - one peacefully . I cannot see an American remake of this without a lot of on screen blood and violence which , in my humble opinion , would drain the story of much of its humor . I will give just one example of what I mean , out of many possible . One of the men standing between Price and his title of Duke of Chalfont is played by Guiness as an amateur photography enthusiast who keeps a stash of sherry and whiskey in his windowless woodshed , in which he develops his prints . Guiness also hides some whiskey there , his wife being a " prig " . Price substitutes an explosive for the kerosene in the lamp of the darkroom . Later , Price , Guiness , and Guiness's wife ( Hobson ) are having tea and Guiness decides to rush off to the woodshed to " develop " some film , leaving Price and Hobson carrying on a civilized conversation . About one hundred yards behind the couple is a stone wall behind which is the shed . Some time passes while Price and Hobson trade decorous Victorian observations on photography and so forth . During this exchange we hear a slight " thud " . A few moments later a wisp of white smoke appears from behind the stone wall , roughly in the vicinity of the woodshed . The smoke increases and becomes a billow , at which point Price comments that " someone must be burning leaves in the garden . " Try as I might , I can't imagine a modern remake of this particular scene without a long suspenseful and explicit demonstration of Guiness going into the shed , striking a match , lighting the lamp , and having it explode in his face . There would follow an exterior shot of the shed being blown apart by a fireball , the stones flying through the air , the shrieks of Hobson and Price at their tea . It would simply be a different movie and not nearly as good . Man , this is funny . See it quick before they remake it and ruin it , as they did recently with Ealing's " The Ladykillers . "
443309	819382	51196	9.0	Thoroughly Successful 50s Comedy .	What a neatly done job this is . Tony Randall is Rock Hunter , a minor functionary at a Madison Avenue advertising agency ( this is a 1950s comedy and Mad Ave was the target of many jokes ) . He's about to be furloughed from his organization and then , by accident , manages to nail the outrageous Jayne Mansfield for her endorsement of the Stay-Put Lipstick account . Jayne doesn't care about the account but she wants to make her boyfriend back in Hollywood jealous so she pretends to be Randall's sex slave . An embarrassed Randall goes along with it . It all creates more ripples than Brittany Spears and Fed Ex or other couples of that ilk . Pretty much everything works . The director , Frank Tashlin , knew his way around a comedy , having been responsible for a number of cartoons . He recognizes a good sight gag when he sees one . Watch the door open and the diminutive Tony Randall appear , back lighted , dressed in the over-sized suit of a muscle man , and wearing elevator shoes , staggering around like Frankenstein's monster . He knows his hilarious dialog too . Randall is speaking to Mansfield's boyfriend , Bobo Branigansky , and pretending to be president of his ad agency . " Of course I'm the president - - but Miss Marlowe will be the TITULAR head of the company . " Mansfield shrieks with delight , grabs Randall , and gives him an open-mouthed kiss , smothering half his face with her huge , blubbery lips . In a later scene , after having half his clothes ripped off by frenzied fans , Randall is offered a drink by the sympathetic Joan Blondell . Asked what he'd like , the morose Randall replies - - " I don't know . Make it something simple , a bottle and a straw . " I don't want to give away any more of the gags , and the story isn't so convoluted that it hasn't already been limned in . Let me add , though , that it's exceptionally well acted by everyone involved . Note , in particular , one long speech done in a single take with Henry Jones , as he explains to Tony Randall that success is nothing more than being in the right place at the right time . How dull it could have been . Yet Jones , with his passionate , dramatic , outrageous sing-song , makes it both gripping and extremely funny . It's my understanding that the movie doesn't follow the play closely but I don't care . It has its own highly original touches . The movie is interrupted , for instance , by Randall who addresses the " TV fans in the audience " and demonstrates the failures of the luminescent orb in a way that makes us appreciate HDTV all the more . That scene couldn't have been in the play . See it if you have the chance , even if you've seen it before . It's anodyne . It will chase the blues away .
441841	819382	113309	9.0	God is in the details	A very good docudrama . But you must be in the mood . It's a low-budget enterprise , talky , and with no bravura performances . Why is it good , then ? I guess it's because it makes certain demands on the intelligence and moral concerns of the viewer that few other renditions of this story have bothered to even attempt . For many years , the United States mythos handled the issue in the most simplistic way . The Japanese were all kamikazes , an invasion of the Japanese homeland would cost untold thousands of lives , so we had to nuke them . Recent revisionist history has given us another version of what happened . The Japanese were on their last legs and they knew it . They were sending out peace feelers through Sweden , Switzerland , and Russia . The United States ignored these because we wanted revenge , so we had to nuke them , and fast . This film illustrates exceedingly well both the Japanese and American sides of the issue , with restraint and intelligence . There are neither heroes nor villains here . And no easy shots are made at particular figures . We can often tell , in conventional flicks , who is good and who is bad by the simple expedient of seeing whether a given character is handsome or homely . We tend not to notice this casting sleight of hand in our own movies because the difference in appearance supports our own prejudices . ( We want the villain to be ugly . ) But if you want this trick to be in your face , take another look at " The Cranes are Flying , " a Russian war movie in which the American officer looks and sounds like a fat bumbling idiot , while the Russian commander is ruggedly good-looking and wears a tolerant shrink-like smile . Such cheap symbolism certainly isn't committed here . The commander of the Japanese army , who wants to fight to the last man , is both attractive and highly principled . Truman may not be a brilliant thinker but he is down-home shrewd and up front about everything . ( If there is a problem with the casting it is that the actor playing Curtis LeMay is too handsome and polite for the part . LeMay was a courageous , ruthless , cigar-smoking blowhard , whom no one but a mother would call handsome . ) So why was the bomb dropped ? Evidently through a series of stochastic misunderstandings - - in intentions , exchanges , even in the translation of particular words . And ultimately in the rush of the United States to end the war - - for any number of reasons , including strictly political ones - - and in the desire on the part of the Japanese to find some sort of honorable peace in which their emporer retained his sanctity , leading to actions too deliberate to satisfy the Allies . The film is at its weakest in posing a false dilemma . ( Or maybe the historical characters were responsible . ) ( 1 ) We invade the islands , or ( 2 ) we nuke them without warning . All the possibilities in between are dismissed for one reason or another . One of them , given short shrift , is the possibility of a naval blockade which would shut off all supplies and cancel all naval traffic from the islands . Japan having no natural resources worth mentioning , it would have been only a matter of time before it worked . Loss of life would have been minimal , and we would not have had to use the bombs - - plural , Nagasaki was destroyed only three days after Hiroshima . One of the reasons repeatedly brought up in favor of using the bomb is that the American taxpayer has put out two billion dollars for this gadget , and if it weren't used they would want to know why their money was spent developing it . ( I don't know of any words adequate to describe this sort of logic . ) A blockade , however , would have taken more time , which would have involved waiting , which is not our strong suit . Another weakness is that James F . Byrne was a personal friend of Truman's . Truman , uncertain and new to the presidency , looked at him as a font of wisdom . And Byrne was a devoted hawk . This isn't made entirely clear , but it was in fact the case . Well , who knows what we and the Japanese should have done ? Easy enough to make retrospective judgments . However , they should perhaps be made anyway . Maybe knowing what went wrong last time will help us prevent things from going so terribly wrong next time .
442780	819382	57012	9.0	Superlative .	The best black comedy ever made . I could watch it a thousand times and still laugh . Oh - - dated , sure . There no longer is a Soviet Union , although there are plenty of people willing to barbecue one another nuclearly - - as in India and Pakistan . I'd like to mention the writer on this , the late Terry Southern , who had lots of input into some pretty funny movies , not to mention his short stories or novellas . He's the guy who came up with " pre-version . " Kubrik did a fine job . He lost his sense of humour afterward . The acting couldn't be better . George C . Scott embeds himself in one's brain as the general . And Peter Sellers . " Look , Mein Fuhrer - - I can VALK ! " They wanted him to play King Kong , the pilot , but it didn't work out . Doesn't matter . It's hard to imagine how he would have improved upon Slim Pickens . " Two pairs a nylon stockin's . Two pair a prophylactics . Shoot .

443085	819382	57163	9.0	A lesson in making a movie .	A story about four people living on a modest Texas ranch , their interactions , troubles and joys , and the ways they resolve their conflicts . The owner of the ranch is the elderly Homer Bannon ( Melvyn Douglas ) . His surviving son is Hud ( Paul Newman ) . Hud's nephew , Lon ( Brandon De Wilde ) is the naive seventeen-year-old , and Alma ( Patricia Neal ) is their hired cook and housekeeper . The setting is the dry , windswept cattle country of West Texas , not far from a small town in which everyone seems to know everyone else . The film has been criticized as too mechanistic , too full of stereotypes , and it's easy to see why . The principals are easy to categorize . An adjective or two will seem to suffice . The " honorable " , old Melvyn Douglas . The " mean " , unprincipled Paul Newman . The " inexperienced " Brandon De Wilde . The " down-to-earth " and sensitive Pat Neal . But this approach , I think , overlooks the subtlety of the characters . The psychologist Gordon Allport proposed that people were made up of many traits ( extraverted / introverted , for instance ) . Allport was able to dig up 3 , 000 trait-like names from an ordinary dictionary . He noted that some were more important than others . The important ones were " central traits " that showed up consistently in a person's behavior . The less important he called " secondary traits " . They were tied to particular situations or moods and were real but transient . You might , for instance , be reserved with everyone else ( a central trait ) but warm and affectionate with your dog and canary ( a secondary trait ) . " Hud " is able to make the same distinction . Sure , the old guy is and overstuffed with old-time pride and honor . That's him in a nut shell . But he's also pretty huffy with people whose morals he's not entirely comfortable with , and there's evidence that he's been antagonistic towards Hud since Hud's childhood . He even admits it . ( His honesty is a central trait , remember ? ) The same is true of the other three main characters . Hud is a mean SOB but " even Hud gets lonesome sometimes . " The kid is more like the old man , thoughtful and fundamentally decent , but he has a kinda hankerin ' for the wild side too , which he sometimes indulges . The same is true for Alma , a hard-working , good woman , with urges she keeps in check . What does this mean on screen ? It means the characters , as written , are fully fleshed . They don't seem like characters in a movie but rather as people we know , with genuine complexities of character . Kids may not understand why this film is as good as it is - - and it's very good - - but adults should be able to " get it " . The performances are excellent , with De Wilde's the weakest . Paul Newman may be handsome but he has a clipped , nasal , argumentative Texan tone of voice that's an immediate turn off . He should never run for elective office . And he does a marvelous drunk , lurching around in a muscular way - - just enough . I'll mention only one example of a thoroughly realized scene . Pat Neal has a brief conversation with De Wilde while she's waiting for the bus to leave town . De Wilde : " We're sure going to miss you , Alma . " Neal : " Oh , you'll get along . ( pause ) Don't you be lazy now , you hear ? " And her face twists with anguish for a second or two before she and De Wilde fling themselves into a wordless , helpless hug . I'm not sure there have been that many more understated but wrenching scenes on film . The script ( by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank , Jr . ) also gives De Wilde a certain believability that his performance does not . Sitting in a bar with Newman , a little drunk , flirting with some gal down the bar ( " I'd sure like to take her the long way home " ) , De Wilde gets to his feet , practically puffing out his chest with an beer-fueled , almost-achieved adult masculinity , and says , " I think I'll go shoot some more nickels into that juke . " Nothing more is made of this endearing , pathetic bravado . I have to mention the photography of James Wong Howe too . Such crisp black and white images . It's harder to see on the small screen , but Howe manages to capture the precise outlines of distant thunder clouds while keeping the middle ground in focus . And we can almost feel the atmosphere of the ranch's yard when Newman and De Wilde are dunking their heads in the trough to sober up after a night on the town while a handful of stunningly white moths whirl and flutter around their torsos under a naked light bulb . This is one of several excellent movies Newman made during the 1960s , and it was a shocker in its time - - the mass slaughter of the cattle , Newman's bitter dialog , " This world is so full of crap , you're bound to step into it sooner or later . " Oh , it's nothing now , but it was a big surprise in 1963 . A fine film all around and it shouldn't be missed .
443454	819382	60200	9.0	One of the most successful comedies of its decade .	I caught this on its first run in Honolulu after spending two years in a place with no movie theaters . I laughed all the way through it . I was certain that enthusiasm was the result of all the previous deprivation , and some of it was , but the luster hasn't worn off this film on subsequent viewings . It's still funny and at time hilarious . Federico Fabrizi ( Peter Sellers ) is an escaped convict who must find a way to unload a horde of stolen gold from a ship . He gets his friends together , they find a small fishing village suitable for bringing stolen gold ashore , con the aging movie star Tony Powell ( Victor Mature ) and his agent ( Martin Balsam ) into cooperating , claiming they are going to make a " neorealist " movie about unloading stolen gold . Seller's sister , Gina Romantica ( Britt Ekland ) will play opposite Tony Powell . ( Mature : What's neorealism ? " Balsam : " No money . " ) All of the villagers , including the mayor and the police chief , are used in the fake movie to unload the real stolen gold . Everybody gets caught . Sellers takes the rap and escapes again . The end . Now , it isn't surprising that Neal Simon has written a funny screenplay based on his play . He was at the top of his game at the time , and nobody is better at barbed exchanges than Neal Simon at his best . What's amazing about this film is that it is so far removed from Simon's usual bailiwick , the comic contretemps of New York Jews . Here he deals with Italian culture and he's got it just about perfect . The film , directed by Vittorio DeSica , who should know neorealism when he sees it , pokes fun at empty Italian bravado , the almost incestuous obsession with protecting the virtue of one's sister , the allegiance to national laws as a sometime thing , the police as little more than a largely ineffective nuisance , the pretentiousness of Italian films of the period ( Fellini and Antonioni are skewered ) , pompous film critics who see art where there be no art , the vanity of aging actors ( Mature : " I have the pupils of an eighteen-year-old boy ! " ) , the spell cast over ordinary nobodies by film-making , and a host of other targets . It's not just Simon's dialog that makes this outstanding . I can't believe that the comedy would be so effective without DeSica's willingness to puncture the Italian film industry and the culture that embraces it . Example : The fake film has been hastily thrown together and is shown as evidence in court . And , good God , what a horrifying abortion it is . The gang know nothing about movies . We see about five minutes of black and white film . They've used wide angle shots so that human faces turn into bulging gargoyles . In some scenes the camera is on its side . There are utterly pointless shots ( sometimes in slow or accelerated motion ) of people doing nothing of importance , of actors running nowhere ( " no matter how fast you run , you can't run away from yourself " ) , of Peter Seller's behind as he bends over , of rocks , of surf , of nothing . When the film flaps around the take-up reel , a man in the courtroom leaps to his feet in the applauding wildly . He announces that he's a film critic and that Sellers is a " a genius ! A primitive genius ! The best film to come out of Italy in forty years ! I cried ! I cried like a BABY ! " ( The judge throws him out and call him crazy . ) I can't continue this without laughing , but I have to mention one more gag . Sellers real name is Aldo Venucci and in his home he is bragging to his mother and sister that he is ashamed of nothing . To prove it , he throws open the window and shouts " I am Aldo VENUCCI ! " In the street below , two of the gang are shielding their faces and they hiss up a warning , " The po-lice ! The po-lice ! " Sellers instantly dashes from the window and hides in a bathtub . Consistently funny , a long jab at phoniness in its every manifestation . Recommended without qualification if you're in the mood for laughs .
443064	819382	74937	9.0	One of Neil Simon's Funniest	Simon is good at barbed exchanges , as in most of " The Odd Couple . " But he has a tendency to get serious sometimes and it rarely works , even when the serious ones have some occasional good one-liners in them . His drama tends to be dull , and his comedies funny , especially in domestic contexts and when they're dialogue dependent . This is different from his other familiar works . He really lets go here , forgets all about serious undertones , " meaningfulness , " depth of relationships , domesticity , continuity - - everything except the comic effect . He's the Edgar Allan Poe of comedy here . He hasn't written such a funny script since " After the Fox . " The plot itself , after the broth is reduced , is simple enough . Truman Capote invites five of the world's most famous detectives to a weekend at his spooky country mansion , tells them a murder will be committed at midnight , and challenges them to solve it or lose their reputations . What follows is hilarious . Not just sharply funny exchanges but entire situations that are in themselves outrageous , so that the verbal elements are like icing on the cake . It's the kind of movie in which a line like , " My chauffeur was injured by a falling gargoyle while standing outside in Chinese footprints , " makes an idiotic kind of sense . A movie in which a character can offer this as an explanation for his having been found in a gay bar : " I hate them queeries . Lots of dames go in those places anyway . I never kissed nobody . And I never done anything to a man that I wouldn't do with a woman . " A movie in which two old ladies are about to fall asleep in bed when one of them sniffs and says , " I smell gas . " The second says : " I can't help it . I'm old . " The first says , " No , no . Not THAT kind of gas . The other kind . The kind that KILLS . " And the second begins a reply with , " Sometimes MY gas . . . . " I could go on with these gags but why spoil it ? And anyway there are sight gags and situational discombobulations that are just as funny but would take far too long to describe . Not all of the gags and situations are equally funny . ( How could they be ? ) Nancy Walker plays a mute maid who's purpose in the movie eludes me . And some of the gags are silly rather than funny . But the weaknesses are minor and more than made up for by the movie's many virtues . Especially good is Peter Falk's Sam Diamond , who does an insane impression of Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade . The actor played the same character in the later , less-successful " The Cheap Detective . " Simon even allows himself to play with the frame at the end . Falk and Eileen Brennan ( " my secretary and mistress " ) are driving away from the mansion and Brennan says , " I guess this means we won't be seeing each other anymore , Sam . " Falk : " Well , Angel , you can never tell . I'll be around . And if you need me , all you gotta do is whistle . You know how to whistle , don't you ? " Brennan : " Well , of course I know how to whistle , Sam . What a silly question . Everybody knows how to whistle - - " Falk looks disgusted , turns away from her to stare into the camera , and says , " Allright , allright . Forget it . You ruined it . " I won't go on any longer about this sometimes extremely amusing film . Anything I would say would ruin it , although I must add that this is one of those movies you can watch and enjoy repeatedly , and without necessarily being in exactly the right mood for it - - unlike , say , Marx Brothers movies or W . C . Fields . It's one of the most laugh-ridden products of its decade . Watch it .
443013	819382	116282	10.0	Don't Forgo Fargo	Boy , is this a good movie . In its bare bones it is a crime drama but the Coen brothers constantly undercut the seriousness with a quirky irony . The acting , the script , and the direction lift the movie light years above most of the movies of its decade . The performances , for instance , everyone speaks with what passes for an upper Midwestern accent , a very pronounced accent , let's say . So when characters are doing wicked things on screen , it's rather like watching people dressed in clown suits do nasty things . It's utterly impossible to take it very seriously - - only just seriously enough for us to feel sorry for the victims and to disapprove of the bad guys , but no more than that . Everyone except the two killers are forced by their culture to speak and act cheerfully . They never swear either . " You're darn tootin ' , " they say . The casting couldn't be better , with Frances McDormand , Steve Buscemi , and Bill Macy outstanding . The script is likewise splendidly done . It's full of scenes that seem peripheral except that they add to our understanding of the characters and often lead to later payoffs . Without taking the space to describe them , I will simply mention the scene in the restaurant between MacDormand and her Japanese friend from high school . Why is it in there at all ? ( My God , those hotel restaurants are depressingly ugly . ) Well - - among other things , such as establishing the kind of milieu these folks consider Ritzy , it tells us quite a bit about how MacDormand handles attempts to violate her inherent good nature . When the Japanese guy tries to sit next to her she tells him firmly that she'd prefer it if he sat across the table so that she can see him more easily . When he breaks down in tears she whispers that it's all okay . She is polite , a little distant without being unfriendly , completely practical , and absolutely iron bound in her values . Nobody is going to take advantage of or discompose this hyper pregnant babe . Further , this scene is a set up for a later one . After MacDormand learns that the Japanese guy has told her a gaggle of lies , she wakes up to the fact that , yes , people can tell untruths - - and she returns to interview Macy a second time . In another scene , when she's pressing one of the criminals during an interview , he excuses himself for a moment and she spots him taking off in his car . She exclaims , " Oh , for Pete's sake , he's FLEEIN ' THE INTERVIEW . " It's impossible to improve on a line like that , or on MacDormand's delivery of it . The third element of the film that makes it superior is the direction . The pauses come at the right times . A woman is sitting on her couch watching a soap opera on TV . Through the glass door of her apartment she sees a man approach . He's wearing a black ski mask and carrying a crowbar . He walks up to her door and shades his eyes while trying to peer inside . Now in an ordinary action movie , by this time the woman would be screeching and speeding down the hallway . Not here . The victim sits there staring at the intruder as he fiddles at the door , half horrified and half curious . " Who is this guy ? He's not the meter reader , is he ? " Coen the director has an eye for the suggestive picturesque too . Bill Macy has asked his father-in-law for a large loan for some sure-fire business proposition , but Dad offers him only a finder's fee . We see Macy's deflated face as his disappointment sets in . Cut . Now we're looking at a white screen punctuated by four or five bare trees equidistant from one another , and there is a tiny car in the middle of the whiteness . Then Macy's tiny figure trudges into the bottom of the shot and we realize we're looking at a snow-filled parking lot with only one ordinary-sized car in the center of it . Wintery weather plays an important part in the movie . People die in it , drive off the road because of it , stand shivering in it . Two freezing people are conversing on the street while one shovels snow . The shoveler stops , gazes up at the sky , and remarks that it " ought to be really cold tomorrow . " Cars and ambulances tend to drive in and out of white outs during blizzards and blowing snow . MacDormand is driving her murdering prisoner through a blank white landscape in which nothing much is visible and she is mildly remonstrating with him , saying something like , " Why did you do it , for a little bit of money ? It's a perfect day , and here you are . " ( A perfect day ! ) There are seven murders in this movie . Only three take place on screen . The others either take place off screen or else the director has the good sense to cut at the moment the gun fires or the ax blade lands . " Fargo " is one of perhaps half a dozen movies from the 1990s that I would consider buying on DVD . It's an original and refreshingly adult picture . Don't miss it .
442765	819382	98769	10.0	Landmark Series	I can't see any reason to go on at great length about this 9-part series . It's a technically revolutionary film . Burns and his colleagues , along with Errol Morris , have changed the nature of the documentary . Burns , working with old photos on glass plates , an unpromising base , the occasional talking head , and often penetrating and sometimes poignant voiceovers , has contributed to our cultural iconography . His touches have been imitated countless times in the following decade : the sound of buzzing locusts , the voiceover reading a letter or a military report and then signing off by reading the name of the writer aloud , these are now taken-for-granted techniques in documentaries ( and commercials as well ) . It could be argued that before this series appeared , interest in the Civil War as an historical event was practically nonexistent . I'm not referring to interest in seeing pretty ladies bounce down the stairs of the big house wearing hoop skirts and ribbons , but the ghastly things taking place at locations that previously had barely rung a bell in our collective long-term memories , like Shiloh . I was teaching at an eastern university when this series appeared , roughly fifty students , known to be among the brightest available , majoring in communications ( read " journalism " ) . When the series had finished , I asked the class how many had watched at least one episode . One hand went up , tentatively . I asked why she'd been so tentative and she said , well , she hadn't really " watched " it , but her husband was a CW buff and was taping it while she passed through the living room several times . The last I heard , fewer than fifty percent of our High School seniors could pin the Civil War down to the correct half-century . It's against this background of general ignorance that " The Civil War " should be viewed . It's structure was more popular than academic , and it seems to have had a good deal of general appeal , my elite class notwithstanding . Popular enough so that a book appeared shortly afterward , " Historians Respond , " edited by Bob Toplin , which predictably consisted almost entirely of carping over details , and of claims that Burns missed the whole point of the CW , that he didn't pay enough attention to the role of women and African-Americans . In other words , that he didn't make the kind of movie that THEY would have made . ( Why is it that academic professionals are so irritated when an outsider , or even an insider , achieves popular success in their fields ? ) They demand too much . For one thing , a viewing of the series makes it clear that Burns et al put some effort into presenting the points of view of women and African-Americans . If the prevailing professional opinion is that he didn't go far enough , well , every book has a last page . A program dealing exclusively with the part that slavery played in the CW would have been another program . A word about the commentators . Bearse knows combat ; he was a marine on Guadalcanal . He sticks to military facts , mostly tactical . Senator Symington is surprisingly smooth and knowledgeable . I was kind of surprised to find him here . The two chief commentators represent the original opposing points of view . Shelby Foote states proudly in the epilogue to one of his historical volumes on the CW , " I am a Mississippian . " But he's a gentleman , not a stereotypical redneck . He admires the Confederate Southern Army without disparaging the Federals . ( Who could help admiring the CSA as a military force ? ) But , like all polite Southerners , he seems slightly ill at ease discussing the CW in a public venue . He seems like a nice guy and is a marvelous story teller . Barbara Fields , an academic historian , has far less screen time . The first impression the viewer gets is that , wow , she's a knockout looker ! The second is that she's cool as a cucumber and presents the modern view that the CW was all about slavery , that blacks were the central figures , that whites were almost peripheral to the issues . It's hard to argue with her . After all , slaves were suffering for two hundred years while whites were engaged in " the pursuit of happiness " for themselves alone . Yet her anger flares up on occasion , and it seems misplaced to me . " I don't have much patience with people who say that [ abolition ] was difficult because of political circumstances , " or something like that . I hope future historians are kinder to us than our present historians are to Americans of the 1860s . Slavery should never have been sanctioned under the Constitution but if allowances hadn't been made , the South would not have joined the Union , and who knows what would have happened . It was the slaves that paid the price for that union . Given that it was already in place , what could Lincoln have done about slavery that he did not in fact do ? Declare it illegal at the firing of the first shot ? Hardly . It was an explosive issue . Kentucky , Missouri , Maryland , and Delaware were slave states that did not secede . Any attempt to turn the CW from a fight to preserve the union into a fight to free the blacks might have turned those states back into the Southern camp . Moreover , Lincoln's support in the legislature depended on Democrats , and Republicans too , who were opposed to any attempt to make the CW into a struggle for black freedom . If Lincoln lost his majority in congress he might have lost the whole game . As it was he jumped at the first chance to issue his Emancipation Proclamation ( which was far from a complete proclamation of emancipation ) . Lincoln wanted to do this from a position of strength , so that it wouldn't seem a panicky move . The occasion he used as an excuse was the battle of Antietam , which he declared a victory . ( Some " victory . " ) Fields was wrong , too , in saying that we're still fighting the CW today . The chief issues of the war have been resolved . There is no more slavery . African-Americans can vote if they want to . They can take whatever empty seat on the bus is available . Affirmative action works to their benefit . If she means that " social equality " has still not been achieved , she's quite correct . One of the reasons perfect equality hasn't been achieved is that the achievement would involve our completely ignoring the fact of race in this country , and at this point it's inconceivable . It's not simply that white people carry around a lot of baggage from the past , but that African-Americans do too . To ask that contemporary African-Americans give up the social cohesiveness and group loyalty that the suffering of their ancestors earned for them is asking a great deal . Social equality is just not a practical goal in a pluralistic society . ( " Pluralism " might be roughly translated as " voluntary segregation . " ) Equality depends on everyone's ability - - and willingness - - to ignore race and ethnicity . I'm all for it . These tribal loyalties are nothing if not bothersome . ( They are poised to lead us into yet another war . ) Burns's series shows one earth-shattering step that has brought that still impossible goal a little closer than it was .
443272	819382	33467	10.0	Late Bloomer Endures - - Movie , not Director .	I don't know exactly what's left to say about " Citizen Kane " , about it's technical dazzle or the maturity of its plot , but it's interesting to note that its prominence gained height only gradually . At first , if not disregarded , it was mostly unnoticed , probably because William Randolph Hearst and his newspaper chain ( pre-TV and pre-blog ) avoided any mention of it . Only in the last 20 years or so has it been recognized for the masterpiece that it is . Of course everyone's heard of it by now , and though most of us admire it , some despise it . I suspect that if some of us dislike it , it's not because of the film itself , but because the majority adore it . This is known as " contrarianism " and I blame the Frogs for it . The French - - I can carry on with these Olympian generalizations , can't it ? I mean , I'm protected by the First Amendment , right ? The French have this tendency to turn common values upside down . That's what gave the world Jerry Lewis . Not that I intend to put France and its couture down entirely . The single best sandwich I ever ate was in the Gare du Nord . But , really , take the anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss as an example . Greek mythology ? Pfui . Let's look more closely at Tlingit myths . The Tlingit are not proto-scientists or philosophers . They're a bunch of clam diggers in the Northwest . I should know , having lived with them . Where was I ? Oh , yes . That sandwich . Wow . Getting back to " Citizen Kane , " I watch it now and again - - not too often because I have it memorized . But here's an example of why I think it's a masterpiece . Okay . Charles Foster Kane has forced his wife , who has a mediocre voice , to push herself into becoming an opera star with the help of his vast financial resources . She fails and tries to poison herself . Here's how that scene plays out on screen . The camera is shooting poor half-dead Dorothy Comingore in fuzzy close up , looking anything but glamorous , breathing heavily , covered with sweat , unconscious , her face away from the door on which Kane and his minions are banging . Behind her figure is a table on which we see the suicide apparatus - - bottles and glasses . It's a rear projection , meaning that Comingore was being filmed while a screen behind her ( previously shot ) is being shown behind her . And - - within THAT back projection - - there is a third projection screen of the door , which finally swings open and admits Kane . Back projections were in common use in 1941 - - but a projection within a projection ? ( Welles used the same technique later , in " Lady From Shanghai . " ) Okay . As someone said , Welles was a kid with a new toy - - the camera . But he turned it into a model that did barrel rolls and crazy eights . Few have done it better since then - - and Welles ' technique was tacked onto an adult story with no bad guys and no good guys , yet gripping . A young man loses his illusions as he ages . ( Don't we all ? ) Welles ' output went downhill from there , his apologists notwithstanding , not because of a monstrous ego . That's too easy . He couldn't bring himself to finish the editing because it was never again to meet his demanding expectations . Don't let revisionists beguile you . It's one of the best movies ever made , and you can measure its quality along any number of dimensions , from Greg Toland's revolutionary photograph to Benny Hermann's subtle but apt score . It's pretty good .
442270	819382	40416	10.0	The best Hamlet ever - - so far .	I think it's safe to say this is the best Hamlet so far . Not that I've seen them all but it's hard to imagine how anything in this production could be much improved upon . The story , admittedly , is kind of dumb . Everybody since Samuel Johnson has been trying to figure out why Hamlet just didn't go ahead and kill Claudius . Ernest Jones psychoanalyzed Hamlet to uncover his hidden motives . But the answer is a simple one . If Hamlet had obeyed his father's ghost , marched down the steps , and killed Claudius on the spot , that would have been the end of the play , as well as the end of Act I or whatever it was . You might as well ask , when the Indians are chasing the stagecoach , why don't they just shoot the horses ? But the dialog never goes wrong , even though Olivier has deleted some unnecessary files and defragged the rest . As one lady said after viewing the film , " I don't know what's supposed to be so great about it . It's all made up out of old quotations . " Some of the old quotations , usually corrupted , have entered the English lexicon without our awareness . " Every dog has his day . " " Neither a borrower nor a lender be . " " The play's the thing . " " There's method in his madness . " " To be or not to be . " " Alas , poor Yorick . " " In my mind's eye . " The production design in this black and white film is spare . Hardly any superfluous furniture . And it's obviously bound to the studio , and yet it's extremely effective . It has the kind of fog you never see in real life . The last scene , of Hamlet's body being born up the stairway to the tower , takes us on a leisurely tour of previous settings - - the bed chamber , the king's prayer room - - like Welles ' camera in the climactic shot of Citizen Kane , moving over the expensive worthless material goods left over from Kane's life . The performances and direction themselves would turn this into a memorable movie . First of all , what a cast ! Christopher Lee ( Dracula ) as a spear carrier . Peter Cushing , another Hammer veteran , as a gay servant . Anthony Quayle . Stanley Holloway ( Liza Doolittle's garbageman father in My Fair Lady ) as a quick-witted gravedigger . And Olivier himself , brooding and animated by turns , and doing a splendid job of mock fencing , a truly physical presence . It won several Academy Awards , including best picture and best actor . I wonder if it would win anything today . Awards seem to have become hardly more than glitzy settings in which Oscars are given to the biggest pictures that bring in the most money . Well , no sense being too cynical . Let's just say that Olivier's Hamlet is worth about two or three dozen Pearl Harbors and Titanics . If you get a chance to see this , or rent it , don't let the fact that Shakespeare wrote it keep you from watching it . The old guy had a way with words . And , after all , you have incest , five murders and one suicide , and some sneakily bawdy lingo . ( " Did you think I meant country matters " ? )
