449864	2093818	87909	1.0	Hmmm . . . contains some spoilers	I had heard good things about Phenomena , and I thought that was what I had found when I borrowed this from a friend ; however , what I saw was , apparently , the heavily cut , shoddy American version , Creepers . While I can't compare this to the original , I doubt that it can be very good , if it contains the same footage that was in Creepers . I don't care how much film was cut from that , it couldn't possibly have been good . I'll start by bitching about the music ; how can someone , ANYONE , possibly think that rock music like that belongs in a horror movie , any horror movie ? It belongs , if anywhere , in an action movie . Next complaint is the camera angles ; never have I seen anything so confusing on film , as was seen in the last half hour of film . Not even in Vidocq , and that says a lot . That's the second worst camera movement ever ; the entirety of Vidocq . Hmmm , what else . . . oh yes ! The special effects . Never have I seen such extreme use of special effects . And the worst part of it is , they're ONLY there to terrify ; none of them are ever explained properly . SPOILER For example , the boy with the monstrous face . . . oh , he's got ' A disease ' , OK , now it all makes sense ; so that's why his face is totally disfigured . And the pool of dead people , we are never told why that crazy bitch is conserving corpses . The movie , as a whole ( if you can even call this mess a whole ) barely makes sense , at any level . I guess if you like insects , or you like to watch special effects that serve no real purpose in the film , you might like it .
450639	2093818	91225	1.0	Just really , really , really bad	I honestly don't know how I've managed to sit through this P . O . S . movie even once ; it sucks so bad that it's impossible to know , or even speculate , how on earth it got through the entire production process , and all the way to the movies . The fact that this film isn't on the bottom 100 list here on the site is both astounding and scary . The movie is carried by usual 80's action / adventure clichés , bad acting , awful special effects , a wandering plot that barely makes sense no matter how you look at it , or how much you suspend disbelief . Believe me , the ridiculous dialog ( with lines like " No ! He'll hit you ! Duck ! " " And proud of it ! " ) is just the nail in the coffin . Seriously , what was wrong with the people who made this movie ? They get almost painfully attractive Lea Thompson ( probably best known as Caroline of Caroline In The City ) , place her in a scene in her underwear , and then they stop there . What's wrong with these people ? A talking duck ? Come on . . . I know that this was based on a comic book , but judging from the movie ( and its success , or , rather , lack thereof ) it should have stayed as a comic book . The film even makes Tim Robbins , a very good actor , look like a complete and utter moron , not to mention a poor actor ( which he definitely is not ) . The film is just so horribly dated and poorly done that it's ridiculous . Granted , it's somewhat original , but originality does not equal greatness . The film is basically a tour of the 80's , and a great example of how ( poor ) movies were made in the 80's . At least it did terrible at the box office , so we weren't forced to tolerate a sequel to this crap . Some might enjoy this , but I certainly didn't . I recommend this only to huge fans of typical 80's movies . Everyone else ; stay away . Far away .
450252	2093818	171465	1.0	For huge fans of Lance Henriksen only	This is one of those movies that some networks / TV channels buy the rights to for slim to nothing , and then put on when they've got nothing better . Unfortunately , I was not aware of that , when I caught this on TV a few years ago . Actually , I just realized it today , when I watched it for the second time , and was met by the same disappointment . The film has just about everything that a movie is supposed to have . . . the elements are all there , they just . . . suck , I believe the appropriate word is . It's got a plot . . . but it's paper-thin . It's got acting . . . but it's atrocious . It's got several characters . . . all of which are clichés and stereotypes . It's got dialog . . . but it's cringe-worthy for the most part . It's got action . . . but it's poorly choreographed and even more amateurishly executed . It's got twists . . . but they are obvious from a mile away . It's even got a good point . . . but it's told in an overly preachy fashion . All in all , the film just really doesn't have anything to offer . . . apart from seeing Lance Henriksen in a really bad role , and seeing Nancy Allen in a post-RoboCop trilogy role . Nothing else . The film is laughable in its attempts to entertain , and winds up only being tolerable due to the ( obviously unintentional ) comic relief , provided by the astounding amount of stereotypes and clichés . I recommend this only to huge fans of Lance Henriksen . . . and possibly ( provided that they do exist ) fans of Nancy Allen .
450691	2093818	89826	1.0	Just when you thought the series couldn't get any worse . . .	Well , here it is . . . the last Porky's film . The lowest of the low . Does it actually get any worse than this ? I hope not . The first two movies had some ( albeit not an awful lot ) value and were just above being garbage committed to celluloid . . . this one is different , worse . The direction is lazy and uninspired . Scene after scene is misdirected and lacks effect . The writing , since the first two films , has taken a turn for the worse , something I didn't think possible before watching this tripe . Characters are messed up completely , going in a completely different direction from what was seen in the first two films . Jokes and gags are incredibly forced and unforgivably poor . The humor is taken down a further notch from the first two films ; again , a surprise for those of us who weren't aware that it was possible to go any lower . Acting is overplayed and uninspired . Unlike the first two films , this one doesn't have one single redeeming quality . . . it's just bad . Really , really bad . I couldn't give you one good reason to watch this film . . . not a single one . I recommend this only to people who loved the first two so much that they simply can't stand the notion of there being a film in the series that they haven't seen . . . no matter how bad it is . Everyone else should avoid this . . . at all and any costs .
450638	2093818	262571	1.0	Horrible	Having seen only one other Bix Skahill film ( well , actually , looking on his filmography , this is only his second film , meaning I've seen everything he's done , feature-film-wise ) , I must say , this is really bad compared to the other one . Chain Of Fools ( which wasn't directed by Bix , only written by him . . . maybe that's the problem with this one ? ) was good for a laugh ; it wasn't great , but it was original , fun and a good use of a great cast . This is a muddled mess of the genres romance and comedy , neither of which really work in this film . The jokes fall flat , the romance doesn't hold up and the characters are unlikable , one-dimensional and their actions are often illogical and out of character . The film has a number of subplots , several of which are reused from Chain Of Fools ( jeez , show some imagination , will you ? ) . Several actors from Chain Of Fools also have parts in this one , but their talents are pretty much wasted here . The film has nothing new to offer ; if you've seen Chain Of Fools , you've seen what Bix can accomplish . . . this is , unfortunately , a mess of a movie , and a bad example of his work . The dialog is poorly written , most of the parts are overplayed , the film has no redeeming qualities and no funny moments . Please , Bix , spend more time writing the next script , OK ? Or if you're going to direct again , please learn how to do so before releasing something as bad as this film . I don't really recommend this to anyone , as it's just really , really bad . Go watch Chain Of Fools ( or , even better , something even funnier than that ) instead .
449946	2093818	295701	1.0	Brings new meaning to the term ' insulting to the viewers intelligence '	Values change over time . A hundred years ago , you were happy if you could live past the age of thirty and had someone you liked to spend your time with . Until recently , you expected an action film to be more than a muscled guy spouting poor one-liners and blowing stuff up . Well , I guess that would be recently meaning up to the early 80's . . . but this is really setting a new standard , breaking all limits and going through the bottom and setting a whole new low . When did movies get this damn loud ? I had to turn down the volume before the opening title appeared on the screen . Before I proceed with this review , I must give you an example of just how bad it is , try to give you an idea of it . About three minutes into the film , a guy ( who is clearly a secret agent , and clearly meant to die right away ) runs through a crowded dance floor , knowing he's been spotted . Instead of trying to disappear in the crowd ( come on , nobody does that anymore . . . right ? I mean , it wouldn't do anything . . . not even throw off the orientation of whoever is chasing him and give the sniper aiming at him a run for his money ) , he jumps up on the stage . . . making himself the most obvious freaking target ever . So what happens ? He gets shot . Big surprise . Yeah , but what happens next ? He falls backwards into the crowds ' hands , who treat him like he was stage-diving . . . ( backwards . . . unmoving . . . with a big , red spot on the front of his suit . . . honestly , how much does the film-makers expect us to swallow ? ) No , seriously . At that point ( well , actually even before that ) I knew that the movie I was about to see wouldn't have any value or serve as anything even remotely interesting . It's not even a decent time-killer . . . I've stared at spots that were far more exciting than the fake , clearly orchestrated action . I've seen drunks and stoners that were more coordinated than the gun hit placements in this film . The plot makes no conceivable sense . The pacing is so far off that I'm surprised I didn't fall asleep a few minutes ( not to say it wasn't a struggle ) . The acting is horrendous , with one or two possible exceptions . One thing I want to make perfectly clear ; Vin Diesel is NOT one of those exceptions . Vin Diesel . . . what kind of a damn name is that ? You don't have to be a genius to figure out it's a fake name ( oh , sorry , an ' artistic ' name . . . please ) . You want to know his real name ? Check his biography . No , wait , I'll make it even easier ; I'll tell you . It's Mark Vincent . Now doesn't that just sound cool ? No ? Well , apparently Mark didn't think so either . What's that ? He was convinced that he wouldn't be popular with that name ? Well , Schwarzenegger didn't change his name . Neither did Van Damme . They seem popular enough . . . right ? The truth is , Mark is just a poser . . . he's just another muscled guy who can't act but who is attractive to the girls ( god only knows what they find so damn amazing by that brainless jock ) . He spends half of the movie talking about how it's bull that video-games and violent movies corrupt the American youth , and you can't help but think about what he says . . . and realize it's true . He's the one corrupting them , he and anyone else responsible for this movie and any other of its kind . All this talk of anarchy and the general ' screw you ' attitude towards any form of authority . . . seriously , it's like they're trying hard to turn kids against parents , teachers and cops . Isn't America sufficiently plagued with young criminals ? And what the hell is up with the thoroughly misogynistic way of presenting female characters ? Just about all of them are whores and generally just there to please the men . No protests , no ' I'm better than this stuff ' attitude anywhere . . . they just accept that women are made to serve men , and nothing else . The one female character who isn't " giving it away for free " as my favorite character ever , Dr . Cox of the TV show Scrubs would put it , is still a hooker . I think her exact words are ' I could be your girl instead of his ( the bad guy's ) . . . if you would pay me as much as he does ' . OK , so maybe she isn't really a prostitute . . . but she falls head over heels over Mark , after knowing him for very little time . Finally , I'd just like to say that the effects are generally horrid , the action is dull , derivative and lacking in any imagination or creativity and the weapon / gadgets usually work as a huge tease . Being the big lover of weapons that I am , I was a tad excited when Mark was handed what has to be one of the biggest damn hand-cannons seen on film . Imagine my disappointment when the sap barely uses it at all . The same goes for gadgets ( less important , but still ) . Also , near the end , Mark gets to drive a bad-ass car with a trunk-load ( literally ) of destructive hardware . . . and it's only used for having the typical ' there must be something here we can use / oh what does this button do then ' scene . The characters are all stereotypes and clichés , with Mark being the guy who saves the world because he has muscles , a low vocabulary , a ridiculous accent and some poor one-liners , Asia being the girl who falls in love with Mark for no apparent reason , the geek who gives Mark his gadgets ( I won't bother to change his name ) . Eve even shows up , seemingly just to tell off a video game producer . . . because Mark won't ' sell out ' . Whatever the hell that means . Wouldn't someone fighting for video-games be honored or consider it a victory to have his own game ? I recommend this only to fans of Mark as well as mindless teenagers with no conception of how the real world works . If you're still not sure , yes , I do hate Mark Vincent / Vin Diesel . I really do .
450510	2093818	146402	1.0	Horrible from start to finish	Not one single good gag . Not one single funny line throughout the film . The entire cast gives lousy performances . I know that when the film was made , Raul Julia ( may he rest in peace ) had died , and that Christina Ricci was getting a little too old to play Wednesday ; but did they really have to recast everyone else , too ? The only original cast members left are Carel Struycken ( Lurch ) and Christopher Hart ( Thing ) . All of the new cast is severely miscast ; Tim Curry has pulled off some good performances in the past , but come on , he's just not Gomez . Not in a million years . He lacks the ' Latin-American ' spirit that Raul possessed . Daryl Hannah obviously tries hard to portray a Morticia faithful to Anjelica Huston , but she fails ; she's too lively , and far too naturally beautiful ; they tried to cover it up ( well , mostly . . . for some reason , she shows cleavage in the last scene . . . who thought of that ? Ridiculously out of character . ) but they couldn't . Another problem is that she's too luscious , whereas Morticia is supposed to have a dangerously , unhealthy thin figure . Patrick Thomas , who plays Fester , is a joke . A bad one . He overdoes Fester so horribly , that I actually cringed every single second he was on screen . I doubt that he could have done much worse . The new child actors are also bad ; Nicole Fugere as Wednesday lacks the eeriness and creepiness of Christina Ricci . She never conveys any sort of emotion , not even the disgust that Ricci did so well in the previous two films , whenever something happy or lively was around . Nicole lacks that talent ; she just looks the part , that's all . It's pretty much the same with Jerry Messing , the new Pugsley . He looks pretty much like Pugsley is supposed to look , but lacks the acting ability of Jimmy Workman , the actor from the two previous films . The humor of the film is as bad as it gets ; whereas the first two had great black humor , this one is reduced to childish humor , which just every once in a while has a bit of ' blackness ' to it . But it's all childish , which means tons of humiliation of , and ridiculous amounts of pain inflicted to , different characters for no apparent reason ( other than to make children and people with equally bad humor laugh ) . The effects are also excruciatingly bad ; you would have thought that they'd have developed better techniques through the five-six years that passed between making the previous film in the series and this . I mean , honestly , the effects look worse than they did back in the first film . All in all , this is one of the worst films I've ever seen , and I think it's too bad that they had to end the series with such a horribly unfunny film . I don't recommend this horrid piece of garbage to anyone , even children shouldn't be mistreated and go through the pure torture it is to watch this wretched film . You think I'm exaggerating ? See it for yourself . . . no , better yet ; take my word for it . . . it's horrible . One of the most pathetic attempts at comedy I've ever had the enduring pain of watching . If you do decide to give this film a chance , be prepared for the absolute worst . You were warned . . .
449906	2093818	118615	5.0	A film as devoid of life as a victim of the title creature	A rapper and a singer who think they can act and / or have any business acting join forces with several actors and a comedian and face a large snake . The film was put together for the sole purpose of putting said snake , the type of which is in the very title , on the screen , the justification for such is not . . . present , and the main reason for choosing to do such a film seems to be the fact that the effects could be achieved in 1997 ( and , looking back , heck , maybe even looking at it back then , the might have benefited from waiting some ) . Not all the effects are bad , though . The acting is largely poor . Voight sounds like Jean-Claude Van Damme , and at one point , he even pulls off a move that would have fit more if done by said " actor " . More or less everyone else is negligible . The writing is set up to make sure the snake can appear . The technical aspects aren't horrible , they're just not particularly impressive . Editing , camera-work and all is flat and uninspired . I suppose some males may be attracted to Lopez and Wuhrer . I'm not sure there particularly is anything for women in this , but hey , if you're a female and you dig the film , that's fine . This is essentially creature-horror for fans of B-movie cinema . I'm not sure anyone else will find anything particularly spell-binding herein . I recommend this to those who fall into the former group . Those wanting a proper portrayal of the reptile , as well as anyone expecting a solid performance from even the most dependable of the actors may want to consider if they wouldn't be better off skipping this one .
450644	2093818	95687	5.0	Possesses some charm , but is ultimately just a very poor entry	I'm not much for the 80's . I was too young to remember them ( was 4 when they ended ) , and listening to the music , looking at the hairstyles and watching the movies . . . it's just not the same . This particular brand of 80's comedy hits a particularly bad note with me ; the fish-out-of-the-water , combined with ridiculous sci-fi and with many of the jokes heavily , pitifully overdone . As such , this movie is hard for me to objectively review . . . so you will have to forgive me if this turns a tad too cruel . Having seen this at least once before , a few years ago , I mainly watched this to see the popular teen actors at a younger age . . . Lewis , Hannigan and Green . It was quite amusing to see them so young , and I don't regret investing a hundred minutes of half-attentive time on it . . . again . The film itself is OK . . . the plot is about as far out as they go , but I guess it's somewhat original and surely an interesting idea . The pacing seems mostly off , and you're often pondering when a scene will move on . This may be that I'm used to newer , more fast-paced movies . . . but I have few ( if any ) problems with Hitchcock's films , even his oldest . . . so I suspect that it's the direction rather than my attention span . The humor is mostly poor , or at least overdone . The gags are maybe funny at first , but when you get down to it , it's basically one joke told over and over , and it's just not that funny or original . The acting seems somewhat shoddy , as well . The characters are mostly one-note jokes , walking clichés , stereotypes , whichever expression you prefer . All in all , this is a fair comedy , considering the time it was made , but it's not really worth watching unless you're a big fan of some of the actors . I recommend this only to very big fans of several of the people involved in making it .
449839	2093818	83530	5.0	Crash and burn	You know those movies that really don't need sequels ? Can you tell the Hollywood producers about that ? Abrahams and the two Zuckers , or ZAZ , agreed not to do this . Thus , they abandoned this , and evidently took almost all of the hilarity with them , whether or not they intended to do so . That left this with some pieces of comedy , but mostly what there is just hacks , coughs , sputters and dies slowly and painfully before the viewers ' eyes . It's not a pretty sight . This is a soulless , less " honest " spoof . There is arguably more objectionable content in the first five minutes of this than the entirety of its predecessor . The bits that are , at times directly , lifted from it tend to do little other than highlight how little this one has on the one that came before it . Several cast-members return , including the two leads , however , the script they were given leaves them powerless to save this . Even Shat doesn't quite save it ( and he certainly does try , and does well with what he had to work with ) . It would be too harsh and critical , if not by particularly much , to claim that none of this is funny at all ( heck , when at its best , which is extremely seldom , it isn't without outright hilarity ) . It's pretty half-hearted , and comes off as being made for the bucks , not the laughs . The fact remains that it offers next to nothing , and certainly not a thing that comes even remotely close to being worth possibly risking messing up the memory of Airplane ! , if one fears an inclination towards that . There's a lot more sexuality ( and usually the gags and jokes go on for so long , it ceases to even hold potential for humor . . . and reach the level of being gratuitous ) , other offensive material ( except for drug references ) and language in this . The end credits featuring the as-of-yet-unfulfilled promise of a third entry is really a perfect testament to the failure of this . Perhaps it can at least help deter follow-ups that are useless and uncalled for from being released . It certainly isn't alone . Lastly , let me point out that this is not merely a case of a sequel being a letdown . . . it's simply not a good film . I recommend this to those who must have both in the series .
450807	2093818	305711	5.0	Simply not funny	I remember the advertisements for this film . It never looked like a movie that I'd want to spend any energy or money getting to watch , so I never did . As it aired on TV tonight ( not even for the first time , either ) , I decided to give it a chance . The plot holds little originality , and it's not terribly interesting or engaging . The acting is fine , but overdone much of the time ( seemingly more the result of the writing and direction than the work of the actors ) . The characters are neither likable nor realistic . They seem stereotyped and one-note , in spite of attempts at fleshing them out . Kutcher and Murphy have both given in good performances and been in good films , but here . . . well , at least they have fairly good on-screen chemistry . The humor mostly consists of mishaps , usually involving pain , with the occasional awkward and / or embarrassing situation . No observations , no wit , no clever references . Just unpleasant scenes . The pacing is OK . As clichéd as it was , I must admit that I liked the ending ( formulaic and predictable as it may be ) . However , by then , it was much too late . A film that's just annoying and not at all funny , this is one you should not spend time on unless you're into the Adam Sandler type humor of pain and embarrassment being funny . I recommend this to fans of Sandler and his type of comedy . Everyone else should most likely just steer clear .
449979	2093818	289848	5.0	We comedy-fans are grieving . . . it's a process . The way sucking the fun out of this film must have been	In case you are wondering about my one line summary . . . it's based on a gag in the film . And it's so much of a running gag that they must've had that thing training for a marathon before they made the movie . I'm not kiddin ' , it's said the better part of a dozen times , in a 90-minute movie . Now , I grant that the first was hardly a work of art . By all means , it was perhaps good for a few laughs on a slow night with nothing else or better to do , but this , my gosh , this " film " takes everything the first was and takes away what charm there was to it . The characters are reduced to stereotypes . Tons of jokes and scenes are recycled , and any merit they may have is all from having appeared ( and possibly worked ) in the first film . Someone compared this to Men In Black 2 . . . and I would have to agree that this is a sequel in that same vein . More or less everybody comes back , some simply to reference their character in the first , and everything is , supposedly , taken up a notch . Scenes are pushed further into the extreme . Any humor that could have existed in this film is lost due to everything being so forced . The plot is written around how to shove Crystal and De Niro together again , and it only goes downhill from there . Was there any point to making this sequel other than the anticipated profit ( which apparently did not come to be ) ? Analyze This did not need a follow-up . La Paglia isn't terrible . I suppose the film is watchable , and not as bad as others out there , but you ought to ask yourself : " Is this something I need to spend my time and / or money on ? " I recommend it only to those who simply must see more after watching the first . . . and even those should take care , because opinion seems evenly divided between those who enjoy it and those who regretted watching it .
450068	2093818	338526	5.0	Definitely not great , but surely not as bad as some claim	This is a movie about the well-known famed monsters of the 1800's , mainly Dracula , The Wolfman and The Frankenstein Monster . While the original movies , and pretty much every movie about one of these creatures is a horror movie ; this is , however , just a comic book movie that features them , and Dracula's nemesis , Van Helsing . It has no horror in it at all ; several of the creatures in the film are ridiculed more than they're feared ( well , mainly Igor , but at times Frankenstein's Monster too ) . The movie does do something to pay respect to the source material , but , alas , most of it is lost in special effects . Nearly every scene features some form of special effects ; there are more effects in the film than there are action sequences . I don't know any other films by Stephen Sommers , but in this , the action consists of far too much CGI , thereby giving us something to look at , rather than something to be excited about ; granted , the CGI does look pretty good , but some " all-live action " action sequences would really have helped . I also found the action scenes to be fairly repetitive . Half of them either start or end with someone being swung by a wire / rope / whatever . That's an OK idea for one or two action scenes , but in this movie , it happens no less than five times . Then it just gets tedious and bland . You start to wonder if the director has too few ideas for how to put together action scenes . It also made me wonder if he had seen too much Tarzan as a child , and wanted to copy him swinging from tree to tree . Most of the action scenes also involve far too much talking , and far too little action . There was a scene were the vampires kept talking on and on for five minutes or so , before finally attacking the victim , whom they had cornered from the beginning of the scene ; of course , this only happens to the main characters , anyone else is killed instantly . Which just makes it all the more predictable ; quite unfortunate , seeing as how it was seemingly made to create tension and intensity . The action scenes are fairly intense , but the director hardly ever gives us time to breath between them , thereby just annoying the viewer , rather than giving an intense feel to the film . The action , whilst being intense , fails to excite or entertain , which leaves the viewer feeling bored . The talking in the action scenes also usually kill any form of excitement , rather than intensify it . In fact , the film seems to prefer special effects over action ; there were several scenes that could have become great action sequences , instead something " unexpected " happens , and we are " treated " with more CGI . They also seemed to love the things they could do with the special effects far too much , resulting in them overusing it to the extreme ( main examples being Dracula's walking on walls and werewolves & Mr . Hyde jumping constantly from one place to another , which just annoys and distracts the viewer ) . The plot is OK , but very far-fetched and only barely makes sense . I got the feeling that the script was written more or less around which plot twists the director wanted ( in fact , if I'm not mistaken , Sommers also wrote the script , as well as directing it ) , and which action / special effects sequences he wanted in the film . The acting is not particularly good , but not bad , either ( well , some of it , but most of it is OK ) . The Monster has the delivery of an opera singer . . . I wasn't sure if I should laugh at the poor acting , or clap at the notes he hit . The characters seemed too much like clichés ; the bad-ass hero who cracks jokes and saves the day , the strong female who can fight for herself , except for when she needs to be rescued by the hero , the slow , goofy sidekick who's only in the film ( at all ) to provide comic relief , etc . The humor in the film is decent , however there is a little too much of it for a dark film based on horror movies . A few of the jokes did make me laugh , however , the goofy nature of several scenes made me laugh harder . All in all , a decent comic book movie that lacks any of the serious nature of its source material . I recommend this movie to fans of comic book movies , but fans of any / all of the source material should be advised , that this does not pay very much respect to the original stories . Just remember ; you were warned .
449939	2093818	245943	5.0	A decent spoof of The Blair Witch Project	When reviewing this film , it's hard not to be at least a little biased ; there are people who love some of the hip-hop / rap artists in this film , and hate the rest , there are some who hate all of them ( and the entire rap music genre ) , and then there are the few who love all of them ( I guess , though I've never met anyone who loved all of them , especially since many of them hate each other ) . Let me say right now : I hate Vanilla Ice and Ja Rule , I have an enormous amount of respect and love for Eminem and his music , and most of the rest of these artists I am indifferent to ( several of them I don't even know ) . I did indeed want to see this film because I knew Eminem was in it , though not as much for his talent or my being a fan of his , as simply the fact that I knew that he can be incredibly funny , as I've seen a lot of interviews with him , and he also played a great funny character in The Wash with Dr . Dre and Snoop Dogg . And let me tell you right away , if you like Eminem's warped , funny sense of humor that we often see in interviews , you will like his performance in this film . He can really convince you that he believes what he's saying is true , no matter how bizarre it sounds . Many of the other rappers give half-decent witness statements , though a few were very bad and just took up screen time . Worst was probably Ja Rule and Vanilla Ice , in my opinion , but then again , that might just be because I hate them . The " main characters " of the film have unbelievably little screen time , actually , and are probably only there to make fun of the original group of morons from the original Blair Witch film . They only have one really funny scene , and then a scene at the end that obviously makes fun of a similar scene in the original Blair Witch , and apart from those two , I'd guess they have two or three other scenes , that might have one or two good jokes in total , while the rest , like several other things in this film , merely take up screen time . What's funny about this film is , even though there seemed to be so many low points and pointless scenes , I never really felt like turning it off , or leaving the room to do something more fulfilling , like I seriously considered with the original Blair Witch film . Maybe it was just to see the next hilarious Eminem sequence , but something definitely kept me glued to my seat throughout the entire runtime . A lot of the jokes in the film are based on what the viewer knows about hip-hop and ghettos , not to mention black slang , which definitely limits the audience of the film , though I would say that the title can't throw too many people off . This is a spoof of The Blair Witch Project , that revolves around various hip-hop stars . The plot is fairly incoherent and all over the place , though I think that's the point . Don't expect some huge plot twist or to be told a great story . It's basically some hip-hop artists making fun of the basic premise of the film , a witch hunting hip-hop artists . The acting is hard to comment on , I wonder if it's supposed to look as lame and bad as it does , which I'm pretty sure that it is . The characters are also all over the place , with only a few of them being part of the actual story ( apart from , of course , the hip-hop artists themselves ) , and even fewer of them have enough screen time for us to actually recognize them , in the next scene they're in ( but maybe that's just me ) . All in all , a decent film if you're a fan of hip-hop and you just want to have a good laugh that's mostly on The Blair Witch Project's expense , but not something I would recommend too many people to watch , as many will hate it ( It appears that most who've seen it already do ) . I recommend it to huge fans of one or more of the hip-hop artists , or just people who'll go to great lengths to laugh at and mock The Blair Witch Project . Not something you want to spend too much money on ( I got it as a gift , thankfully ) .
450174	2093818	132910	5.0	There's a new bird in town . . . it's remarkably similar , though unlike it's predecessor , its quality doesn't quite soar	I watched this before the original The Crow . In fact , I'm not sure I realized that this was part of a series , much less the third part . Now , having watched the original ( I have not seen the second movie ) , comparisons are unavoidable , and they are , I'm afraid , entirely and mercilessly unfavorable . This " gets " rather little from the first at all , and even less of it gets done right . There are attempts for the tone , but in spite of introducing new perverted enemies for the undead bird to seek out and combat , it just doesn't have the impact of the first . The language and nudity is present , but that's hardly what made the first excellent . The style . . . I don't know , it tries . More often than not , the film comes off as silly ( unintentionally , I'd wager ) . The plot could have been better , and it seems like there was at least one point where they go for demystifying some of the supernatural elements ( fantasy is by no means a genre I venture into often , much less enjoy , but in the original , it definitely worked ) . The powers may have also been altered . The pacing is reasonable , I guess . The acting is usually unimpressive , except for perhaps moments by the two leads . The music isn't bad , mostly rock , and dark in mood , fitting . I wouldn't exactly put up much of a fight if someone tried to sell me the soundtrack . The action has some to offer , as well ( if it gets terribly overblown and overdone at parts , in its attempts to outdo the first film ) , though I can't claim that it'll stay in your memory for long ( and , come on , if we're going to watch a young man fight , are we going to choose Eric Mabius over Brandon Lee any day of the week , on a dare , to win a bet and / or any other reason ? I refer you to Will Smith's oft-used catch-phrase of many of his movies for an answer ( hint : it's the one where he uses a word that refers to downstairs , and no , I'm not talking about a basement ) . The effects are good . The movie is shot and edited fine , if there aren't really any ground-breaking moments . A lot of this seems almost remade from the first , just lacking what made that film great . Gone is the poetic justice . Images , events and the basic structure of the film are recycled from the first , almost to the point where you start to wonder if these film-makers actually had or even thought they had anything to actually contribute to the franchise , or if they just saw a cash cow , grabbed a teet each and squeezed , as hard as they could . Actual fans of The Crow should steer clear of this . If all you want is a revenge flick , and you either don't mind or prefer them with some touch of fantasy and / or the supernatural , knock yourself out . I recommend this to those who find themselves in the latter group ( I've got no problem with people in said group . . . I just want to make it clear who are likely to enjoy the film ) .
449978	2093818	398937	5.0	Does what it's supposed to	This featurette consists of four sit-down interviews , shown one by one , inter-cut with a few pieces of artwork , stills from production , behind the scenes video and footage from the movie itself . One interviewee also spends a minute or two describing his work on the subway scene while he shows the audience the animation software he used . There's not really anything fancy or wildly attractive about the production of this . . . it's very straight-forward . The editing is about as to-the-point and without surprises as it comes . At one point , an interviewee puts away the slides he's been showing , and the camera slowly pans back to his face . . . no effort is made to conceal the relaxed camera-work . And who says that such is necessary ? This wasn't made to entertain , it was put together in an effort to explain some of the effects of the film , as well as giving us an idea of how the design came to be . . . and it succeeds in doing that . It's a fairly thoroughly interesting and informational 22 minutes , and it is neither too long nor too short . Each interview details specifically with one aspect of the film , the one that they dealt with . These include the creation and conception of Pearl and the fighting styles ( including a brief outtake from practice ) . There is a brief glimpse of Snipes as he has a bit of scene planning explained , and as he practices some choreography , but apart from that , this really focuses on the interviews and the details therein . All in all , an adequate presentation . I recommend this to any fan of the film ( and anyone in general , really ) who wants to know more about the design , fight choreography and special effects .
450955	2093818	328107	5.0	" Why , Tony , why ? "	Having not really seen any other Tony Scott films than Enemy of the State , I didn't entirely know what to expect from his new revenge / vigilante action-drama , but the trailers looked so darn promising , so I thought , " what the heck . . . can't be all bad . . . " Believe me , I've learned my lesson ; never judge a film by its trailer . The film is decent at best , overlong and it jerks the audience's sympathies around , without delivering any actual action . The plot is pretty good , but why does it take so ridiculously long to take off ? My gosh , I was halfway through the film and almost falling asleep before something happened that wasn't just character development for Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning's characters . When the revenge actually took place , I sat there , in the theater , attentively , and really expecting something awesome to happen . But it didn't . I waited through the rest of the film , and nothing remarkable happened . There are " action " scenes ( if you can call a bunch of large explosions ' action ' ) , but they aren't actually impressive , as they appear in the trailers . The acting is pretty good . The characters are somewhat well-written . The pacing is dreadful . The film seems to never actually take shape and be anything . . . first it's a character driven drama , then an action piece , then a character driven drama again . . . and it keeps jerking our sympathies around , until the audience don't care about anything but when the film ends . The cinematography is pretty good , but it keeps cutting and skipping and it winds up giving you a headache . Once the revenge starts , Scott overstylizes the crap out of every moment , presumably because he didn't get to do his thing before that point in the film . The ending was probably the worst piece of typical Hollywood crap I've seen for a while . What kind of supposed feel-good crap . . . how are we supposed to believe that ? If you see this movie , you'll know exactly what I mean . In conclusion , Tony can direct action decently , but he should stay far away from character driven pieces for a while . After seeing the film , leaving the theater , thinking more and more about it , I realize that I sympathize more with the kidnappers than the main characters . That's not as much the fault of Tony Scott the director as Tony Scott the human being , though . He expects us to care about this family just because they're the main characters , while the villains in the film have it much worse than they do . Bad idea , Mr . Scott . All in all , a decent film , but not one I care to see again , and not one I would classify as ' action ' . Not even partly . I recommend this only to big fans of the actors and director Tony Scott . Everyone else , smell the smoke and realize that this is a dud .
450973	2093818	391214	5.0	Makes for a good watch , once or twice	After buying the collectors edition of From Dusk Till Dawn ( mainly to see Full Tilt Boogie , which was also featured in it ) , I saw this nice little documentary . It has some very good interview bits with the various actors and crew-members , but all in all , it's mainly just the actors and crew-members expressing their opinions about Tarantino and Rodriguez , which isn't something everyone cares about ; it has little to no information about the actual process of film-making ( which I suppose Full Tilt Boogie has ) , but I enjoyed it . It was fun to hear the various actors talking about Rodriguez and Tarantino , and there are a few bits where the director and writers family members ( Tarantino's mother and Rodriguez ' sister ) talked about them as well . Not much else to put here , but I suppose I could write a fun little piece of trivia about the collectors edition DVD ; it features two music videos , ZZ Top with She's Just Killing Me and Tito And The Tarantulas with After Dark . Both videos were directed and edited by Rodriguez . I thought that was kind of funny ( partly because he wasn't contractually obliged to do them , which means he just did them , probably for fun ) . They are good , by the way . Both feature immense amounts of Salma Hayek , so most guys will probably enjoy them . All in all , I give this documentary a . Good for a watch or two .
450684	2093818	241760	5.0	Not really anything special . . .	When you know a movie is being directed by someone who has never directed before ( and hasn't since ) , you know not to expect anything great . This teen flick is no exception . Wait , teen flick ? This movie isn't even R-rated . . . it's PG-13 . In other words , it's far , far tamer than most of the crude sex comedies of later years that begun their return to popularity with American Pie . These films will always be popular with teenagers . . . the reason why escapes me at the moment . Well , there's the sex and the crude comedy . . . I suppose that would be it . This has less nudity and cuss words than that of the R-rated ones , making it easier to sit through for those who don't care much for such ( though why anyone like that would watch a movie like this is beyond me ) . It's got a good deal of the humiliation humor and usual " let's hurt someone to make people laugh " attitude . Schadenfreude . Feeding the inner bastard in all of us . Like with most other less-than-impressive teen comedies , it's got more of that , the typical teen humor , than morals and , say , anything of actual interest . There're the nice messages of " high school is tough " and " kids can be cruel , to anyone " in there , but they're practically covered by clichés and bad taste . They're also quite heavy-handed , when they do come up . The plot is somewhat original , but also rather uninteresting and uninvolving . The pacing is poor , I found myself hardly watching at all . The acting is fair , but many parts are over - or underplayed . The humor is fair , with some good laughs from the likes of comedy talents such as Eddie Griffin and the O'Connell brothers , Charlie and Jerry . Most of it is crude and unfunny , though . The cinematography is uninspired . The direction is vapid . All in all , just not a terribly good film , and one that is rather quickly forgotten . I recommend this only to the biggest fans of teen comedies , and look elsewhere if you want T & A or swearing .
450341	2093818	218864	5.0	Stupid , juvenile and predictable	Just when I thought I'd seen the worst teen-oriented romantic comedies . . . this baby hits me . And when I say hit , I mean like a dropkick to my stomach . You may think you've seen it all , but you haven't seen this . . . and you should consider yourself lucky . Like Walt Becker's previous directing attempt ( which was about as big of a train-wreck as this one ) , this features Ryan Reynolds and has incredibly poor taste in humor and will disgust just about everyone who watches it , at one point or another . Granted , this isn't as sick or graphic as Van Wilder , but it's every bit as poor . Becker decides that his talentless direction isn't enough to torture us poor viewers , and tried to write the script for this mess . Luckily , he co-wrote it with Peter W . Nelson . . . who doesn't seem to have written another movie neither before nor since . I don't think I have to tell you just how poorly written the film is , as the direct result of this . The love story is contrived , sappy and unbelievably predictable . The acting is just bad . The characters are never credible , their actions make no conceivable sense and all of them are paper-thin stereotypes . The humor is so painfully obvious and stupid that I can't see anyone finding it funny . The jokes are poorly set up , never funny , and repeated to the point where we're sick of them . There's only one good thing about this movie , and it's Alyssa Milano as a stripper . If you consider that reason enough to see the movie , then be my guest . Lord knows that was the only reason I gave the movie any chance at all . I recommend this to fans of romantic teen comedies and Alyssa Milano . Anyone else shouldn't bother . In fact , if you doubt you would like it , then don't watch it . It's most likely not worth your time .
450762	2093818	102045	5.0	I would think that even Chuck Norris has standards , but , apparently , I was wrong	I can't say very much positive about this film ; it's pretty much the typical , average action film , but it has so many horrendously bad parts and so unbelievably few good parts that it can only just be classified as average . Had it been slightly worse , it wouldn't even have gotten the 5 I'm giving it , which is even partly due to my being in a good mood now . The plot is nearly non-existent , as well as it's lifted straight out of plenty of other , better action movies . The pace is painfully slow ; the film is incredibly hard to sit through . The acting is laughable . The characters are poorly written , ill-conceived cliches . Even the soundtrack / score is bad . There was a point where I actually burst out laughing from the sheer stupidity of the soundtrack , and the directors poorly done , entirely failed attempt at creating the slightest bit of atmosphere . The direction is lazy and uninventive . The cinematography is forgettable , and often looks like the cameraman is asleep . The action is decent , but often far too gory for a regular type of action film ; if it was thriller / action or horror / action , sure , but not regular action . Guys don't see action movies to see throats being cut in graphic detail , or people coughing up ridiculous amounts of blood ; they watch it to see people blowing each other away with guns and / or explosives . And what the hell was up with the knees being blown away in that last scene ? It's not that it was so poorly done ( which it certainly was ) , it's that it's completely unnecessary . We neither expect nor want to see such gruesome violence in a standard action film . The dialog is ludicrously bad , and often unintentionally funny . I'm also baffled at what the point or message of the fight between the two kids was supposed to be ; I get that the father was the reason for the kid being violent , and that violence only spawns more violence , but what the hell did Chuck punch the guy for , then ? Won't that make him ( and , in turn , his kid ) more violent , then ? Ridiculous . The plot twists were also ludicrous , especially in the last couple of scenes where people seemed to change sides back and forth constantly . I can imagine many guys considering renting or maybe even ( heaven forbid ) buying this garbage because of the cover , and , more importantly , the bad-ass gun that Norris is packing , on the cover . Believe me , I understand where you're coming from ; and I made that mistake . I bought this film ( cheap , don't worry ; very , very cheap ) because I ( like you ) expected Norris to deal out some heavy punishment with the double-barrel shotgun . I'm afraid I have to disappoint you ; he uses it in three scenes , and only of them is somewhat entertaining ( not particularly much , though ) . This film really isn't worth any of your time or money . I suggest that if you do get a chance to watch it ( at no cost whatsoever and you don't have anything else to do for those 90 minutes ) , try to think of it as a comedy ; listen to the laughable dialog and music , laugh at the bad acting and the horrible script . It'll make it so much easier . Try it ; I did . And that's probably the only reason that I can be so calm about this mess , er , movie . I recommend this only to huge action and / or Chuck Norris fans . Everyone else should avoid it .
450563	2093818	109813	5.0	Just when you thought your childhood memories were safe . . .	Is Hollywood ever going to stop remaking old classics , or turning old cartoons into live-action films ? I was never a big fan of The Flintstones , but the show did have charm , and was decent children's entertainment . This doesn't , and it isn't . The film starts off with a poorly acted scene that acts as a prologue to the film itself and sets the tone nicely . That means that if you're considering watching this movie , just watch the scene preceding the credits and you can make up your mind on whether or not you want to sit through the rest of this . It acts as a fair warning to even the most overbearing parent . As soon as this scene is over , we get a live-action version of the famous and well-known intro to the TV-series which will make even the most mentally hardened die-hard fan break down in tears and yell " Please make it stop ! Oh my gosh ! " at the screen . The film ends with a live-action re-enactment of the end credits sequence of the show as well , which most likely will bring forth the same reaction . I'm not going to lie to you ; I didn't pay that much attention to the film . It might have been because I saw it once when I was a kid ( almost ten years ago ) . But , more likely , it was just because it was really dull and downright offensive to anyone who is / was a fan of the show , even slightly , or anyone who actually does demand just a little quality from a film they watch . It's so tacky and crude . Honestly , I couldn't tell you one single joke or gag from the movie , and I've just seen it . My mind , my very subconscious represses it , pushes the memory of the film away from the surface . . . and you know what ? I'm thankful for that . No one should have to see this film . No one . It might have a good effect as a torture device , but that's it . Now , to break it down just quickly for you : The plot is dull , pointless , completely predictable ( in fact , almost painfully so ) . The pacing is awful . For a movie that's only 90 minutes , it certainly felt much , much longer . The acting isn't all bad , but it certainly isn't impressive . The characters are cheap clichés and stereotypes , mere cardboard cutouts of their characters from the original TV-series . The special effects are so see-through and poorly done that you have to wonder what the heck the film-makers were thinking . . . if they were thinking at all . Maybe that's it . They slept through the whole thing , and wound up with a bunch of finished film , had it edited by a man with two broken arms and sent it off to the cinemas . I recommend this film only to children , as no adult could possibly be forgiving enough and so indifferent to quality that he or she could actually enjoy even part of this film .
450091	2093818	214874	5.0	Don't bother with this junk ; watch Tim Burton's version instead	I saw this on TV , as I thought it was Tim Burton's version , which I've seen a year ago and was going to watch again sooner or later anyway ; now I feel like watching it more than ever ; this junk doesn't do the myth justice , it's way too slow and boring . I don't know how faithful it is to the original story , but Tim Burton's version of the story is a lot more entertaining , accurate or not . I think one of the main problems is , that the main character is not the least bit likable ; he seems snobby , greedy and pretentious . Throughout the movie , he was the laughing stock of the town , and he's too stupid to notice it . I hated his character with a passion , and hoped he would be killed off by the headless horseman ; I won't reveal here if I was that lucky or not . Overall , this is just your average , bad , made-for-TV movie version of a somewhat well-known story . I know I've praised Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow a lot in this review , but I just need to do so one more time ; this movie is nowhere near as good , scary , atmospheric or entertaining as Tim Burton's version . Go watch that instead , and avoid this junk .
450180	2093818	293564	5.0	This time , it's personal . . . and kinda dumb . . . and really clichéd	I caught this on a plane , as one of the in-flight movies . This was basically the one that made me feel the least amount of strong repulsion , of all the available choices , so I endured the 90 minutes , with some pretty scattered enjoyment . There are some funny things . . . the scene in the dojo isn't all bad . Mostly , the humor didn't really work , at least for me , though . Tucker seems to be growing more irritating as time goes on , and his character seems to have gotten somewhat incompetent . . . in the first film ( I haven't seen the second ) , he was a good cop , unorthodox , and not necessarily popular , but he didn't come off as inept as he did in this . I'm not sure anyone should have to be subjected to the " singing " of either lead . The action has its moments , and there is surely plenty of it . . . even though , as far as recent over-the-top fast-paced action flicks have gone in recent years , since at least the early 2000's , this isn't as ridiculously overwhelming as others . Some of the action clichés , and to a larger extent , clichés in general , are noticeably present . By the time that almost half a dozen instances of characters being endangered by the same basic thing take place in the same scene , in a matter of minutes . . . well , if you don't already dislike the movie by that point , I suppose you may forgive the film that . A previously seen character returns to the franchise , quite possibly the last one we wanted to see again . The film seems to supply as much sexual content and nudity as they could and still get away with a PG-13 rating , and most , if not all , of it is utterly gratuitous , with the only purpose being to attract heterosexual males , and young ones , at that . The plot is obvious and predictable , and sacrifices any kind of sense for the sake of action or comedy ( neither of which are all that strong , for that matter ) more often than not . The cinematography and editing break absolutely no conventions , and both have moments that are downright bad . The acting is essentially unimpressive . The film manages to waste both von Sydow and Baker Hall . The characters don't really possess any charm they might once have had . The one attempt the film makes to stir up emotion fails so miserably , it's not even funny . . . it's almost a parody of scenes like it . This may manage to offend every single race and nationality featured . I guess if you can borrow it from a friend , avoid having to pay , it'll do . I recommend this to fans of the actors , Ratner and / or the franchise .
450319	2093818	268695	6.0	Nice to look at , not terribly much more	Ah , time travel . . . a concept that has fascinated man-kind for many generations ( offered as evidence , the fact that Wells wrote about it , a man who died half a century before this film was made ) , led to many an interesting debate , theories , and yes , some good stories in various forms of media . Is time fluid , is it a straight line , can we truly change occurrences , and is time travel even a realistic possibility ? However , for how many good , thought-provoking , food-for-thought-serving , awe-inspiring stories there are done , there are , of course , also many that are . . . not . This isn't really bad , it's just not great , either . It looks good , no argument there , and it does manage to be exciting and entertaining some of the time . The filming and editing help show gorgeous scenery as well as add intensity to the scenes that aim for that . The pacing is reasonable , if the film seems longer than the 90 minutes that it is . Acting ranges , but isn't too bad . Not sure I realized Orlando Jones could play it so straight . The special effects are amazing , almost without exception . The production design is excellent . The film definitely creates some beautiful imagery . Direction is done by Simon Wells , H . G . ' s great-grandson , and that's about all there is about him . . . he did a few animated features , including Prince of Egypt , none of which I believe I have seen . I've neither read the original nor seen any of the other versions , so I can't say how closely the story is followed . All in all , entertaining enough , and definitely good-looking , so if that's what you're up for , hey , go for it . I recommend this to fans of the people involved and those who enjoy looking at visually appealing imagery .
450932	2093818	63386	6.0	The first in a great series . . . but before it got to be good	Watching this is kind of like watching a drawing by Picasso from his childhood . . . or a home video shot by Stanley Kubrick . Arguably the greatest Danish series of the comedy genre , the films about The Olsen Gang have entertained countless people in many countries . . . as my father informed me , the former Eastern Germany found it delightful , as it mocked authority ( it was permitted by the censors , due to Denmark being a ( primarily ) capitalistic system ) . Actually , when they translated the films ( by dubbing , as Germany and France are two of the only countries to possess too much arrogance and pride over their language to learn any other , including English ) , they had to cut out the character of Yvonne . . . as they simply could not find a German actress to match her . That says something about the energetic and hilarious performance she brings to each of the films ( apart from the very last . . . as she had unfortunately passed away , which was one of the main reasons that it was delayed so many years . . . and was pitifully awful of a movie by most standards ) . The actors , basic plot progression , even the theme was in place , right here , from the beginning . . . it just wasn't as refined as it got to be , through the series . Much of it is just dreadful ; the humor is silly and mostly stays at the level of the common denominator ( though there are some traces of the satire and social commentary of the later films , as well as the human touch , the small details apparent in most of the films ) . The acting is incredibly overdone in most cases . . . even in that of Poul Reichchardt , a seasoned veteran within the art of acting , renowned not only for his film work , but for his many plays in The Danish Royal Theater . The plot is all over the place . . . for an 80-minute film ( most of the later films reach over 100 minutes ) , it's got more mix-ups and complications than most films of three or four hours . In spite of its almost insipid , uninspired simplicity , it's almost difficult to follow , and far harder to recall . The pace is almost constantly , insistingly off . . . as if the film doesn't know when to move , where it's going . . . or how to get there . Some scenes consist entirely of jokes , and many of these are of a comic , cartoony nature . . . the " gang " survive a major blast from explosives , to give a brief example . Anyone who's seen the film will most likely grant that the last few scenes of the film are just about impossible to take seriously . Then there are all the quips ( though , admittedly , some are somewhat funny ) at porno , and the diverse reactions towards it ( at the time , just before it was released , the issue of it was heavily debated ) . . . all in all , this film is just very much a sign of its time . It was made to appeal to the masses , and this is what Danes preferred back then . . . silly , mindless fun . It wasn't until a few films later that this series really started to become sophisticated . But that doesn't mean that this film should be forgotten ; apart from of course an excellent window into the world view of the Denmark of the late 60's , this film should be watched simply to see the roots of this grand series . Most of what people remember of all the good films of the franchise starts here . . . it may not be as refined or well-executed as it got to be , but it's still there . The walk of the gang , Yvonne's rants , Egon's impassioned speech to Benny and Kjeld , the very first heist of the film which is always destined to go wrong ( one might add that the visual of the three , as we first see them , might have been better saved for a later film , or at least a later moment in this one , as it would have a more humorous effect , once the audience were used to the sight of the three as they usually look ) . . . it started here . It has been said that the most important step of the journey is the first . . . and while this is arguably ( among ) the least memorable or entertaining of the steps that is the journey of this series , it is still that vitally important first one . Without this , the world would never have known The Olsen Gang . For that alone , it has my respect . Starting with the next movie , there are changes made . The series heads towards grandeur . . . slowly , perhaps , but it makes it . I recommend this film to any fan of Danish cinema and The Olsen Gang . If you don't know any of the other films of the series ( this wasn't the first I saw ; this wasn't where my interest in the franchise begun ) , I suggest you either look for the good , funny things in this ( since they all reappear , many of them done far better , in the later films ) or give one of the later films ( starting around number 5 , " Runs Amok " ) a chance before or after watching this . There is somewhat little in the way of overall plot throughout the series ( though I advise making sure you see at least one other film before " Runs Amok " , and make sure you don't start with one of the ( 2 ? I think ) " Gang " films that start at their holiday destination ( any real fan of these films will be able to answer that off the top of their head , and anyone who isn't should find out from the films and not this review ) . Not an exemplary start , but does show some promise , evidence of things to come .
450612	2093818	116277	6.0	Uneventful and slow-moving	I've seen this film on the shelf of the local video-shop so many times over the last half year or so . I kept considering buying it , and I kept deciding against it , mainly because I had barely heard anything at all about it ( and certainly nothing positive ) . It aired on TV tonight , and I can only say that I'm happy I didn't spend any money on it . It's not a bad film , but it's not really a good one , either . It's somewhat average and it just doesn't feel like a complete movie . The plot is decent enough , and probably original . . . but it drags like you wouldn't believe . I don't remember the last time ( if there was one ) I saw such an uneventful and slow-moving film . De Niro gives the typical psycho performance , as seen previously in Taxi Driver and more recently in Cape Fear . Scott lazily directs this in no particular direction . . . it pretty much just goes on and on , with pretty much nothing really happening . I'm not sure if Scott was shooting for a character driven piece . . . but if he did , he missed . Unimaginative cinematography and repeated usage of the same cuts further adds to the boredom . A fairly good but overly loud score makes the viewing a tad bit more tolerable , as does the fairly high level of talent in all of the film's acting performances . De Niro's character is interesting , but we know too little about him , about who he really is , his past . In the end , maybe the real problem is that there's hardly anyone to root for in the film . De Niro is introduced as if he was the hero , but we quickly realize that he's the direct opposite . We then turn to Snipes , but he turns out to be a superstitious and unappealing athlete . One thing that bothered me was the heavy emphasis on the baseball game ( but that's probably just me and my anti-sports view-point ) . As far as showing fanaticism and obsession at its worst , the film is OK . As genuine entertainment , there's really nothing in this , beyond the fairly good acting and score . I recommend this only to the biggest fans of De Niro , Snipes and Scott . Everyone else should probably just skip it .
450390	2093818	111003	6.0	Not what it could have been , but worth a viewing	Not having read any of the highly acclaimed writer Robert A . Heinlein's work , including the original novel " Puppet Masters " , I can't really comment on whether or not this piece does him or his work any justice , but from a point of view that hasn't in any way been influenced by his work or others ' opinions ( . . . maybe scratch that last one ) , I must admit that it's not half bad . The plot is pretty good , and it keeps developing at an adequate rate , while keeping a fair pace , but it seems to drop a tad once this entered its last half or so . The acting is decent enough , with Donald Sutherland being the one to stand out and deliver a marvelous performance . The characters are well-written , well-casted , credible and believable . This is strangely similar to TV features , in the way it's shot and edited . The special effects are great , but short of spectacular . The creature design was reasonably interesting , and well thought out , and the related effects are actually relatively nicely done . The science fiction aspects of this , with the aliens and their actions are well-done . I liked the way the film utilizes mood and atmosphere rather than excessive gore to scare and thrill the audience . The atmosphere and mood are decent enough , just not as well-done as they could have been . The movie also fails to inspire the same paranoia and fear that , for example , John Carpenter's The Thing does . Finally , the climax was a bit overly Hollywood-like , but hey , this does provide about 110 minutes worth of sufficiently entertaining science fiction-horror about the always dreaded extra-terrestrial invasion . I recommend it to fans of the genre and / or Donald Sutherland ( it should also be noted that Keith David rocks , as he has something of a tendency to do ) .
450931	2093818	64755	6.0	A step up from the first . . . but a pretty small one	When The Olsen Gang became a franchise , writers Bahs and Balling were quick to eliminate characters that were deemed unnecessary or simply didn't seem to make sense , in that the gang continues their adventures . . . gone are the hookers from Hansen's bar , Benny's fiancée Ulla and the two other kids in the Jensen estate . . . Børge remains , as the only kid of Kjeld and Yvonne . The acting starts to find a more grounded level , instead of always being so incredibly overplayed . Dynamite-Harry ( portrayed by none other than Preben Kaas ; who could possibly play a major drunk better than one who is ( well , was . . . RIP ) one , in real life ? ) , Benny's hopeless drunk of a brother ( who is , of course , very skilled in the use of explosives ) is introduced . The series moves towards the great films that we have come to know it for . The humor is still mostly silly . . . still containing a few mix-ups , as well , though most of these are much funnier and so infrequent , they manage to surprise you ( rather than annoy you , as got to be the case with those of the first ) . The plot is an interesting case ; not so much for the writing itself ( certainly not , it's quite pedestrian , not at all up to the level of some of the later films ) , but for how early the idea it presents came about in the series . The Gang going straight . . . no more crime . . . with the added twist that they are framed for a robbery they didn't ( but certainly could have ) commit . Added to the cast are now the well-known Ghita Nørby as the young , female social worker of Egon ( who has a school-boy crush on her . . . illustrated by the seemingly angelic light that appears around her person many of the times he looks at her . . . believe me , it's funnier than it sounds ) who helps the three " career criminals " ( before Danish audiences knew and saw them as such ) getting real jobs . Most of the jokes about about pornography are absent . . . as is the ( let's face it ) gratuitous half-nude women . In their place are more of the social commentary and satire that the first showed signs of , and that we know and love the later films for ( along with the daring heists , the human touch and the energy ) . Authority is made fun of yet again ( though less bombastically ) , and this time , German discipline and rehabilitation / psychology are thrown into the mix , too . Usually funny , and more often than not , hysterically so . This is also when the series start to feature longer films . . . the first was an hour and 20 minutes , this clocks in at not much less than two full hours . Arguably , much of this time could one do without . . . the scene at the bar featuring the gang , Harry and Mrs . Hansen , the social worker ( and a scene or two immediately following it ) is too long and could easily be cut without it detracting from the overall experience ( opposite that , however , are the delightful scenes at the toy factory , which are among the funniest in the series ) . But this is still a step up . A step further away from the mediocrity of not only the first film , but most other Danish films of the period . It wasn't until later that this series really started to stand out , but this is still a step , and one in the right direction ( it's always annoying when franchises start to step away from the path it really should stay on ) . A few key ingredients are still missing , and , overall , this film just isn't really much better than the first . It's still worth watching , at least to those who want to see how it all started . I recommend this to the biggest fans of the series and those who want to observe the roots of it . As a bonus , Poul Bundgaard shows off some of his talent as an opera singer in this film . Also , this has a fairly good amount of James Bond-ian gadgets . . . for anyone who enjoys seeing that in movies .
450914	2093818	371396	6.0	Decent	This is a featurette found on the DVD for The Matrix , as well as on one of the 10 discs in the Ultimate release . It consists of behind-the-scenes footage , test material , animatics and an interview . John Gaeta , the man behind the technology , explains . . . throughout this . . . and thus answers the question posed in the title . It's not bad , and the information is interesting , it's just perhaps not the most gripping way to tell it . The method is described , and we do get good insight into how it works and the way they do it , the photography and all . For being so short . . . six minutes . . . it does hold a fair amount . The editing is fine . Pacing is unimpressive . This breaks no new ground , and has nothing to offer anyone who doesn't specifically wish to find out more about this particular subject . This doesn't necessarily give anything in the film away ( the first one , obviously , what with the year on this ) , and it doesn't hold anything objectionable , the strongest is images of bullets hitting , of which there is slim to nil in this . I recommend this to anyone who wants to know about Bullet-Time , and maybe fans of the franchise .
450617	2093818	164221	6.0	Not a masterpiece , but sufficiently entertaining	I'm quite a big fan of the typical British humor , I find it a lot more sophisticated than the typical American humor . If you're into British humor , you'll definitely enjoy at least some part of this , as it's packed with it . Some of it is basic , and some of it is wacky , but most of it is good . It deals with a lot of the questions and stuff guys and girls have with having sex as a teenager . The plot is nowhere near realistic , nor very interesting , but it has it's moments , and the humor is worth sitting through the movie for . At the very beginning , the movie was at it's funniest , and after that , it gets slower and less funny , at a continuous downwards loop . . . unfortunately . But , it has some incredibly funny moments at several points in the movie , so it's worth checking out , unless you can't stand British humor or the heavy British accent that every single person in the movie has . The movie could have been great , if it wasn't for a few slow scenes , and some gags that don't have the funny effect they're supposed to have , but you should check it out if you're into British humor , or just plain sexual humor .
450849	2093818	111742	6.0	It seems like it ought to be better	I haven't watched a lot of films concerning werewolves . In general not really creature flicks . This is , obviously , something of a different take on such , and it is certainly an admirable attempt . I just , I don't know , maybe it missed the mark . There is clearly going something on beyond the whole turning ( which is handled fairly well , and this more or less succeeds in making something like that at least relatively believable and possible to take in for those not usually into that kind of thing . . . and those who might shy away from this thinking it'll be the typical entry , don't worry , you can tell the impact the director as well as its star had on this ) . Maybe that's the problem . . . in the end , Nichols doesn't know quite what to do with the wolf . The drama is interesting and reasonably engaging , but beyond that . . . well , some of it is good . If you look beyond what , at least to me ( I am open to the possibility that it's just Mike's style that doesn't appeal to me ) , comes off as uninspired camera-work ( those zooms serve more to distract the viewer than emphasize ) and half-hearted editing that occur more often than not in this , it does have some to offer . Slow-motion never really works in this movie , in my opinion . The score is fine . The acting is pretty much flawless . The effects vary , though they're seldom all that convincing . Nicholson ( who was just about perfectly cast ) is his usual cool self , and I would not at all have minded more Hyde Pierce . The plot isn't bad , and definitely has moments . That describes the humor , what minimal amount there is , as well . There is a bit of violence / gore , and a moderate amount and tone of language . Those seeking horror will probably be underwhelmed , and the people expecting something else may be shocked by some of the content . I recommend this to folk in either or both groups who consider their open-mindedness to be of notable extent . Fans of Jack Nicholson and / or Mike Nichols may also want to grant it a chance .
450030	2093818	86837	6.0	Skip this one . . . especially if you liked the first	Ever heard of the saying ' ignorance is bliss ' ? Well , apparently , Peter Hyams hasn't . Despite his own ignorance , he feels that we should be told a thin explanation of everything of the first AND the second film . Despite the first film being visual and symbolic , this tries to simplify every single little thing in the first through basic , I - told - you - there - was - a - simple - explanation - to - it Scooby Doo-like explaining . Why apply cold logic when the first did so well without it ? Hyams tries to tell the story in a smart and funny way . . . failing terribly on both accounts . The guy who brought us the insipid Timecop and the plain awful Sudden Death once again manages to underwhelm us with his unbelievably stupid and quite unneeded explanation for everything that happened in the first . The film never caught my interest , even though I was quite intrigued to hear of a sequel to the visually stunning masterpiece 2001 : A Space Odyssey . The plot is dull and moves too slow . The pacing is just bad . The acting is not impressive in the slightest . The characters are poorly written and paper-thin . The film just screams ' Hollywood ' from the top of it's lungs , and reeks of it from every single orifice . The language-barrier between the Americans and the Russians is nearly non-existent . The film throws in numerous completely pointless characters that could easily have been removed without impacting the film in the slightest , top of which must be that endlessly annoying kid . The film rationalizes and explains away everything that was interesting in the first . I really didn't see any point for this sequel at all . I urge any fan of the first to avoid it , as it may very well destroy your fond memories of the first . Don't go near this one . I recommend this only to those who watched the first and didn't like the way everything was left a mystery , who wanted to have all of it explained . I would recommend it to fans of Peter Hyams as well , but I doubt ( and certainly don't hope ) that they exist .
450204	2093818	395755	6.0	Fine behind-the-scenes	This is a feature-length special feature on the second disc of the 2-Disc DVD release , from 2003 , of X2 , the second X-Men film . This is perhaps said movie's version of the X-Men Production Scrapbook , on the first film ( found on the 1 . 5 DVD , not the original release ) , in that both are about an hour in length and a general , one-special-covers-all kind of behind the scenes . This does not adopt the candid tone of aforementioned , but rather goes about its objective in the more traditional way , and hey , which way you prefer is entirely up to the individual viewer . This consists of behind-the-scenes footage , stills , interviews and film clips , some inter-cut with each other . The new faces in the cast aren't too bad to listen to , though Cumming doesn't come off as having a lot to say , here . . . Hu is perhaps the best of them ( and Stanford is pretty good ) . The writers and such are quite good , as is Singer . The overall focus / tone is perhaps somewhat loose , which is not to say that the editing isn't tight ( it is ) . Some material of the rehearsal and / or planning of stunts and effects is included . The entire thing is fairly nicely put together , and does have info . I wouldn't call this memorable , but it's got a reasonable pace ( 59 minute running time and I was never bored ) , and it's worth watching for any fan and anyone who wants to know more about the film . I recommend this to anyone who fits into either or both groups .
450541	2093818	78908	6.0	Attack of the romper-wearing mutant kids	I don't really know , about this film . . . it just didn't seem as interesting and fascinating as some of Cronenberg's other work , like Scanners and such . . . the whole plot just seemed a little tame to me , and I have to say that I found it kind of hard to be scared by a bunch of midgets running around in rompers , attacking adults . I know that this isn't supposed to be taken literally or anything , that it's a metaphor , symbolism . . . but unlike Scanners , I never really cared enough about the film to find out , or even consider , what that could be . It just seemed too far-fetched , and hardly scary . The plot is OK , it deals with some weird new experimental method of psychology , or something . . . to be honest , I wasn't paying that much attention . The whole thing just didn't interest me as much as it should ( and obviously needed to ) . The pacing isn't very good . . . Scanners was a little slow , at times , but this just seemed to drag almost for the entire film . The characters are fairly well-written . The acting is typical Cronenberg . . . meaning , not very good . The special effects are OK , but they are way too easy to figure out for the film to be scary through this . The music / score is quite good , though , and that's where most of the scares came from . I don't know . . . maybe this had a huge impact back in ' 79 because it was new , maybe I should have seen this before seeing Scanners . . . I don't know . I just didn't find it particularly good . The showdown at the end was very tame , especially the way it ended . . . the one in Scanners had me biting my nails at the edge of my seat , this one had me just barely looking at the screen . I recommend this only to very big fans of Cronenberg , and possibly fans of B-movies . Most others should just skip this .
450349	2093818	181316	6.0	An average movie . . . yeah , it's " like that "	How watchable this film is depends almost exclusively on your tolerance of Martin Lawrence . It's pretty much entirely his movie . Wilson is just barely there at all , and the rest of the players are there to play off Lawrence ( or maybe rather , for him to play off ) , or provide obstacles for him in his continued quest for the diamond . I'm not quite sure why exactly we should care about his character . . . he's not sympathetic , and his actions are all motivated by his desire to get his hands on the aforementioned former piece of coal . The action is somewhat limited , but OK . It may have gone more for comedy than excitement , well , that , or the director didn't know how to do proper action ( and the end of the last bit to feature it came out of nowhere ) . The plot is decent , I guess . The acting varies . Chapelle . . . you wouldn't know he was funny , from this ( he certainly was in Robin Hood : Men in Tights ) . Greene , well , all you have to do to know the guy can play an unsavory character is watch either Pulp Fiction or The Mask . The music selection is , if nothing else , fitting . Some of the humor is gross-out comedy , and , while it could have been worse ( which it probably would have been , had they not been trying for a PG-13 . . . how they got it , I do not know , there was profanity enough ) , seemed . . . unnecessary . I recommend this to . . . fans of Martin Lawrence .
450529	2093818	79100	6.0	The horse fairy-tale	I like Pollack . I'm not sure there's anything that I wouldn't at least give a chance , as long as he had an important part in the making of it . This is probably the most formulaic thing I've seen of his . . . which isn't to say that it's necessarily bad . It's just that , well , if you don't see the majority of what happens in this , coming , the likeliest explanation is that you haven't seen one of the many films that follow essentially the same plot . It's not exactly unpredictable . The points of it are also made in a pretty see-through manner , with poignant speeches and the like . But with those in mind , and the fact that this isn't necessarily meant to be taken too seriously , this isn't bad . The direction is effective . Its editing and cinematography are well-done . The acting leaves little to be desired . The writing is good . The characters are at least average . The music is very fitting . That would be the original version , with Willie Nelson performing it , not the other kind . There is a limited amount of language in it , of varying degree , not a lot of which is terribly harsh . The drug / alcohol material is vague , and the sexuality tends to be tastefully done ( for being partially set in Las Vegas , this is mighty clean ) . I recommend this to any lovers of the four-legged animal , Redford , Fonda and / or anyone else who helped create this .
450342	2093818	246677	7.0	I don't get it . . .	I rented this because I had heard great things about one of director Tom Tykwer's other films , Lola Rennt , and I couldn't find that anywhere . I certainly hope that film is better than this , because I didn't see any depth or value in this . I didn't really see anything past the nice visuals or the good score . The film starts out great , by one of the best setups for something bad to happen I've seen for a while . After that , it slows down to what is as close to a complete halt , while still moving . I'm not kidding , this is probably the most uneventful film I've seen for a few months . Nothing seems to happen . The very first scene of the film seems to be there only to have the last scene make sense . The film has the main characters running for the last portion of the film , from what must be the most ineffectual police force ever seen in a film , and the least seen . I get that it's not about the chase , that it's supposed to be a metaphor or something . . . what I don't get is what it represents . I couldn't find any hidden message in this , any moral to the story or any depth to it whatsoever . Yes , the film has a good musical score , and yes , some of the visuals are captivating and absorbing . . . but that doesn't make a great film . Without anything else than that , all you have is a shallow film that looks pretty on the surface . The ending holds some ambiguity , but apart from that , there doesn't really seem to be anything in the film to make it worth the effort . For being so short , it's a terribly poorly paced film . The plot starts out good , but doesn't keep it up . The acting is sufficiently good . There are a few good scenes of tension and / or drama . All in all , probably worth it for people into poetry and such , but us regular viewers , even those of us who are willing to dig deep in order to understand films probably shouldn't bother . I recommend this only to fans of cinema as an expression of poetry . I doubt anyone else will find any value in it .
450679	2093818	338111	7.0	Cool , but packed with glaringly obvious plot holes	You can almost always rely on John Woo to deliver great action . . . Face / Off and those of his films that were made before he went Hollywood , especially those featuring Chow Yun-Fat ( or so I've heard ; have only seen Face / Off myself ) are great and popular for his unique brand of cool , stylish action . His use of slow-motion in action sequences are especially popular ; here , he delivers as well . . . but one can't help but think about whether or not Woo ( or anyone else , for that matter ) actually read the script . There are quite an impressive amount of glaringly obvious plot holes for such a short action flick . . . but I suppose what we're supposed to pay attention to is the car ( this is a commercial , after all ) and its capabilities . . . though I think many of them are exaggerated , at least slightly , in this . The acting isn't particularly good , but Clive Owen is still great as The Driver . . . not that one would expect anything else from him . The action is pretty cool , that I must admit . And it somehow manages to overshadow the numerous holes in the fairly thin plot . All in all , worth a single watch , for car freaks . But not much more . I recommend it to big fans of Woo and the commercials , as well as car fanatics .
450475	2093818	482274	7.0	Fire in the hole	This is one of the short featurettes on the DVD of Team America : World Police , going into a specific area of said film . In this case , it's pyro-technics , and several scenes have the secret behind their explosions revealed , and this is both interesting , and , well , fun . Come on , doesn't everybody , deep down , get some measure of joy from seeing something blow up ? Even if they don't want to admit it . This consists of interviews , behind-the-scenes footage and clips of the movie . Matt and Trey don't say a lot , but the guy behind the flames and more does , and he's entertaining , so I'm not complaining . This is not very long , and due to the cool-ness factor of the majority of what fills the screen during that time , it seems to fly by even faster . It's around 5 minutes from start to finish , of an object-smashing , explained-destruction , guided tour through the world of cinematic demolition . And give Joe Visckocil a warm welcome , will you ? No , I'm not quitting my day job . I recommend this to anyone who liked TA , especially the parts where things go boom .
451015	2093818	369061	7.0	Eyes and ears	I don't know what would make one vote quite as low as 1 on this ( as , at the time of writing this , 19 % have ) , other than having expected it to be completely different in form . This is a documentary on the X-Men 1 . 5 ( which holds rather a high quantity of extras ) DVD , going over the entire creative process of the film . It consists largely of candidly shot behind-the-scenes footage , not all of it even being on recognizable sets , and a handful of interview bits ( McKellan and Stewart both come off as wise in them , and not just because they're British ) . No movie clips , no extended sequences of " talking heads " , and any artwork that appears in this isn't inserted . . . instead they pan the camera over to show it . Basically , a Mini-DV was running during ( at least much of ) the planning , rewriting and such , and they edited it together , giving a different , organic result , similar to The Beginning : Making ' Episode 1 ' . You get to be a fly on the wall during debates , watch as they work out the kinks , and you even get to hear about stuff they were going to do . You also see the crew and cast joke around , and see or be told about their initial reactions to sets , props and the like . It is interesting , entertaining , and well-paced . I was never bored , and the hour and a couple of minutes pass smoothly . The anecdotes , the moments , it's all worth the attention of viewers of the final product who want to see what goes on as it's being put together . This isn't particularly linear in narrative , and one portion may not necessarily connect to the one following or preceding it . The quality of the recorded material varies , and obviously not all of it is going to be what one is used to , when sitting down to watch something officially released . There is some language ( more than that of the subject of this ) , and while it isn't terribly prevalent herein , it does tend to be strong . I recommend this to any fan of the series , or even a less dedicated viewer , should they be up for watching a laid-back look at a lot of what goes into doing something that goes up on the silver screen .
449857	2093818	258153	7.0	Uneven , but definitely worth watching	Ever since I first saw Gattaca , I've been looking for other films directed by Andrew Niccol . This being one of them , and so far , one of the only ones ( but I certainly hope he makes more films in the future . . . he has some very interesting ideas ) , I simply had to watch . I was not disappointed . Like Gattaca , this is science fiction ; however , Gattaca is more of a all-out sci-fi film , and S1m0ne only has some elements of science fiction . Before I comment on the sci-fi , I must comment on the great humor in the film . This is the first of Niccol's films ( Truman Show , Gattaca and then this ) I've seen that has comedy ( in the form of satire , that is ) . Truly great comedy , as well . You know why ? Because it's real . It's stuff that we can recognize , stuff that we know from ourselves , from the people around us . The comedy mostly revolves around how easily everyone is tricked , how quick they are to believe in something without any proof . I believe it was Voltaire who said : " If there were no God , it would be necessary to invent one " . We want to be deceived , we want to be tricked , we want to have something to hope for and believe in . I mean , let's be honest ; that is the very basis for why religion exists , and why people claim to spot UFOs . People need to believe in something . . . and they believe in Simone . Despite what her maker has her do , despite no one ever having met her in person , people love her . They need to . They need someone , something to believe in . The many scenes of Viktor covering up Simone not being real , creating the illusion of her in various forms to satisfy other people's urge to see her , meet her , talk to her may be somewhat slapstick in their nature , but they only emphasize how ludicrous and easily bought the everyday man is . They want to believe it so badly , they simply can't accept anything else . This seems to be what most critics of this film are missing . Their refusal to accept it is simply them denying human nature . As Pacino's character realizes near the end : " She's indestructible " . It is not possible to remove her , because the public won't accept it . She must exist . I noticed a lot of references to the story of Frankenstein in this film . It is basically the 21st century's version of Frankenstein , with some computer-based science fiction elements and set in Hollywood . I have never seen a film that so openly mocks the superficiality of Hollywood , and for that reason alone , anyone should see it . The plot is very good , though it develops at a somewhat uneven pace . . . in fact , the pacing seems a tad off . The acting is mostly very good . The special effects are top-notch . . . they were in 2002 , and they still are . This could have been better , but it was still very good . I recommend this to anyone who is interested from reading the plot outline , people who enjoyed Gattaca and fans of science fiction as commentary on real issues .
450651	2093818	178130	7.0	Not bad , for a TV-movie	I don't know much about Cleopatra . . . well , to tell you the truth , before watching this , I didn't know anything at all . The name ringed a bell , and that's about it . I bought this along with the 1997 TV version of The Odyssey partly because my father expressed interest in seeing them , and partly out of my own interest in the epics . While , according to my father , this film gets many details right , it still throws some stuff in that makes little to no sense and which is hardly historically accurate ; some parts were obviously doctored to make for more drama or Hollywood-like scenes ( at one point , Cleopatra picks up a sword to fight several Roman legionnaires with ease ) . The sets and costumes are gorgeous , no argument there . Most of the effects were see-through , but that's no wonder for a TV-movie with a TV-movie budget . The costume people are all in my cool book , though , if for nothing else , putting Leonor Varela in so many sheer , thin and / or tight dresses throughout the film . The plot is mostly accurate . The pacing is fair . Much of the film was clearly based on the real events , the real clothes worn and the real places . They must have done extensive research , and it definitely shows . Bit of a pity they throw away some credibility with aforementioned Hollywood scenes . The acting is fairly good ; Zane , as usual , does not disappoint . Dalton proved to me that he had talent , something I never would have believed about him before . Varela is decent . The visual side of the film is fine , but nothing innovative or impressive is to be found here . Same goes for the depth of the film . I enjoyed the somewhat erotic , though at times nearly soap-opera-like relationships Cleopatra had , but I can see why some wouldn't . All in all , it tells the story ( most of it ) and looks ' real ' enough . Nothing mighty impressive , but most of us have come to expect much , much less of the typical TV-movie . I recommend this to people who want a retelling of the story and want drama more than accuracy .
450447	2093818	74452	7.0	Good acting , but poor script and dull plot	When dealing with fiction , it's mostly easy to make it entertaining . When dealing with non-fiction , true , historically correct stories , you have to make an effort to keep it true to facts ; however , you still have to make it entertaining , otherwise , everyone but the historians and story-loving audiences will find it less than worth their time ; and that is exactly what went wrong here . As far as I know , this film is fairly historically accurate ( apart from the main plot-line , which I'm not entirely sure about ) . It's also well-acted and the locations and costumes are authentic . Thing is , that's all it is ; authentic , historically accurate ( to a certain extent , at least ) and well-acted . The film has little to no entertainment value . I realize that a war film shouldn't be a hilarious or something to cheer at ( like an action flick , for example ) , but it can at least show it's audience the courtesy of being slightly interesting , apart from the plot ( which , I think , to some extent deviates from what really happened , in a typical Hollywood fashion ) which seems predictable and is easily figured out from the very beginning , simply due to it obviously trying hard to be historically accurate , which negates the tension that the last scenes are trying to build . Even in the very end , which contains a twist ( obviously designed to build tension ) is predictable and almost immediately figured out . The plot is somewhat good , it's just too predictable and virtually everyone will figure out how it's going to end , save for the historically ignorant ( who probably won't see the movie anyway ) . The pacing is bad , unless , once again , you're interested in seeing this for the historical accuracy . The film never really seemed to take off , until the last half hour or so , when you've stopped caring about the plot . The acting is very good ; pretty much the only thing worthwhile in this movie . The characters are well-written ( I guess , but they are based on real people , so there's not much room to go wrong there ) and mostly credible . The cinematography is nothing memorable . The costumes and locations are very authentic and well done . All in all , not a particularly good film , but worth watching for fans of ( fairly ) historically accurate war films , and fans of the various actors , since they all give great performances . Anyone else should avoid this . There are far better war movies out there .
450923	2093818	424369	7.0	Sit back , put a clip in the good old . 45 and dish out some punishment in one of the most creative games ever made	This game is great . You get to be The Punisher , something I know many , many comic book fans and aggressive people alike have wanted to for years . Naturally , when a game is finally made after so many years of fans adoring the comics , you have to work very hard to make sure it doesn't disappoint . Well , for my money , I think they did a damn good job . Everything about The Punisher is here , and most of it is spot-on ; the dark atmosphere , Frank Castle's bleak narrative , the punishment , the violence and the guns . Oh yes , the guns . You know those games where they promise tons of weapons , and when you get to try them , they're just four or five basic weapon types and three or four of each of those types ? Not here . Not this game . Oh no . Here , it's short and oh so sweet . Naturally , we get Castle's well-known . 45's , but we also get the one-hand pump-action shotgun ( as seen in the movie ) , a Desert Eagle , several SMG's , various other handguns , some nice rifles including an AK-47 and a . 50 caliber sniper . There's more , but I will leave the rest to be discovered when ( not ' if ' . . . come on , you know you want this game ) you play it . Then there's the violence and the excellent bullet dynamics of the game , coupled with the rag-doll physics engine . . . put those three things together , and what you get is mayhem and chaos , Punisher-style . I'm not kidding , you can blow a body part ( arm , leg or head ) clean off , if you aim it right and use a weapon powerful enough . Any bullet you put into your enemy stays there . . . you can see the blood and the hole it leaves . Whenever you hit someone , you can tell . Their body will react realistically to the impact . Now , the weapons you can carry are limited . . . actually , you can only carry one handgun and one rifle at any given time . You know what ? You won't need anymore . And you can throw away your weapons for a weapon of the same group at any time you find it . But the fun doesn't stop there ; we all know Punisher is strong , right ? He should be able to carry more than one weapon at a time , not to mention use both simultaneously . . . right ? Well . . . brace yourself . . . he can . He can . He can , and by god , it is good . Ever wanted to blow away enemies with two assault rifles ? Or a pump-action shotgun in each hand ? Now you can . If you're carrying a rifle and you come across one of the same kind , pick it up . Punisher will take it with the other hand , and he can now fire both , even at the same time . What's even more awesome is that this is almost completely unlimited . I think the sniper is the only weapon you can not carry two of . The graphics of the game are excellent , and they aren't that ' heavy ' on computer specs either . The sound is of great quality . That brings me to one of the lesser points about the game , though . I know it's standard policy to have enemies taunt you and generally comment on everything the player does , but I think they overdid it slightly . Or maybe it's just because half of the generic ones rarely fit the situation . Much of it is filled with juvenile humor , some of which is overly crude . Then there's the story-line . . . I like how they filled the game with ' celebrity cameos ' , with superheroes and characters appearing here and there , but the way they tried to fit half of Punishers major enemies in it seemed very forced . About half-way through the game , there was one boss per level . I would have liked it better if they had done several separate story lines , possibly having them all be playable from the very beginning , but at least separated the game into chapters , instead of trying to make it seem like the whole thing was , in the end , run by one man . Particularly because I was sorely disappointed when I found out who he was . . . I won't tell you , hate to spoil it , but I didn't think it made even a little sense . I know why they did it , but it seemed like a cop-out , and a dull way of connecting the game to the movie . Speaking of connecting the two , I liked how they had Thomas Jane do the Punisher voice . That made it even more authentic . I'm glad , however , that they chose to make Castle appear like the comic book version , instead of Jane's . Another cool feature that deserves mention is that you can take any enemy as a human shield . . . or even quick kill them , no matter how strong they are ( apart from , obviously , boss enemies ) . Finally , I just have to mention the interrogations . They're endlessly entertaining . You get to force criminals to spill the beans . . . or their guts . There are many different versions of interrogations in the game , and four basic ones . The non-basic ones can only be performed at special places , but they're far more entertaining . You can hold someone over a very fatal fall , with their head down . You can half-drown someone in a toilet bowl . You can even run someone over . . . repeatedly . . . until they talk . It's a somewhat tricky art to master , but it's well worth it . OK , just a tad more negative stuff and then I'm done . The game is a tad repetitive , and the whole shooting thing does get tiresome when you've done it for as long as you need to in order to beat the game , and there's relatively little in the game to return to . There's tons of extra stuff to unlock , but it's very hard to get . There are ' challenges ' . . . but they really should have been named ' impossible feats ' . That describes them better . The levels are very closed-off and there's not much freedom in the game . I recommend this to anyone who's a fan of The Punisher or in need of a good way to relieve aggressions .
449804	2093818	89118	7.0	Original and thoroughly entertaining 80's action movie	I re-watched this film , after having seen it about five or seven years ago , since I had a faint memory of it being somewhat entertaining . I had completely forgot how entertaining it was ; normally , I'm not into 80's movies , especially 80's action movies , but this one had some very unique qualities ; the most important being that most of the action scenes are done by the main character using special effects to trick and defeat the opposition , which makes for some incredibly entertaining scenes . The plot is very good , it's somewhat carried by the twists , but it's very good anyway . Besides , the twists are unexpected , intelligent , and entirely believable ( unlike many newer " plot twist " movies ' twists ) . The acting is fairly good , I personally thought that both Bryan Brown and Brian Dennehy gave good performances . Granted , most of the rest of the cast aren't exactly spectacular , but they're decent enough , I think . The characters are well-written , despite the fact that many of them are 80's action film clichés . The action is great , every scene seems unique and exciting , greatly aided by the unique nature of most of them . As a theme and basic idea , it's excellent . As a film , it's actually pretty good too . I recommend it to any fan of 80's action films , and just about anyone looking for a " different " 80's action film .
450703	2093818	100404	7.0	Pretty good court drama	Being a huge fan of court room dramas , a fairly big one of Raul Julia , and a faithful supporter of Brian Dennehy and Harrison Ford , I decided to watch this film , as it came on TV . I had just seen an exceptional episode of " JAG " , so I was very much in the mood for more court room drama . This film quite definitely delivers . Whoever cast Raul as an attorney knows his stuff . It's a quite unusual role for him , but he pulls it off perfectly . Dennehy is solid as always , and Ford is quite good as well . The plot is pretty good , interesting , and with some nice twists ( though the last one is a tad hard to swallow ) . The pacing is good , you're rarely bored watching this film . The dialog and back-and-forth arguing in court wasn't as good as it could have been ( the episode of " JAG " was better in that area , definitely ) , but it was still pretty good . I haven't read the original novel by Scott Turow , but from what I understand , this is a fairly satisfying adaptation . The story is quite interesting , and there are a fair bit of red herrings , but the final explanation seems implausible . Not the best court drama , but a pretty good one . I recommend this to fans of the actors and of court room dramas .
449859	2093818	290210	7.0	Takes some liberties with history , but a very good idea , and a necessary film	Why this film is so seldom mentioned and so often put down is surprising , when you consider how well-made it actually is . . . but I suppose the explanation lies in the controversy of it , and peoples ' inability to accept an idea so unheard of as true . The idea in this case is that Adolf Hitler was not born the Antichrist , but shaped by the world around him . As several other reviewers mention , this film and the ideas it presents as well as the character study of a young Hitler is long overdue . The film revolves around Hitler , who recently returned from war ( WWI ) and his relationship with Max Rothman , a Jewish art dealer . Rothman senses much talent and promise in Hitler , and encourages him to follow up on painting . Hitler , frustrated with an inability to create anything , and a talent for public speaking leans more towards a political career . I guess we all know how it ends . . . but the story itself is still interesting , even though we basically know the ending . I don't know how authentic this film is , but I do know that it takes some liberties with history . That doesn't bother me . The important thing is the core of it , and whether or not it has some interesting ideas to offer . And I think it does . Most definitely . All the well-known ( and some lesser known ) traits of Hitler's personality are there . One could argue that the Jews in the film are somewhat stereotypically presented , but it's about the environment as well as the characters . The reason Hitler had such ease with blaming the Jews for Germany's problems , the reason he could turn an entire nation against them was that was how people saw them . If we didn't understand that , if we didn't get a clear image of that , the film would be worthless . The acting was very good ; Noah Taylor pretty much becomes Adolf Hitler . I don't care what you say , I felt his frustration and outrage ; he made me feel for this man , recognize him as a fellow human being , despite how much time so many people have spent trying to make him appear as some inhumane monster . He was a terrible man , yes . . . but he was a man . A despicable human being . . . but still a human being . John Cusack brings a fire to his character that pretty much carries the film . The direction was quite impressive for a first time effort ; the writer / director showed great promise , and I hope he will make more films like this . We definitely need them . I recommend this to anyone interested in the subject who isn't put off by a fairly loose approach to history .
450486	2093818	278504	7.0	Not Memento , but hardly without merit	I have not watched the original behind this ( I know , I know . . . and I'm even Nordic ) , but intend to do so if I get the chance . No need to keep secret the fact that I primarily made it a point to get a viewing of this because of its director . I was not disappointed . The visuals , the editing . . . effective and utilizing a nice range of what is possible in film-making , a clear grasp on the tools , without it ever being flashy or not having a purpose . The version I saw was on TV , so it could very well have been edited from the original version , please keep that in mind if something I say seems to be in complete contrast to what you thought . The plot is very good and develops interestingly throughout ( some of them are . . . well , you'll see ) . The pace is not bad , if not all that fast . That is not to say that this doesn't hold tension . . . when it needs to , it's got it in spades . The acting is credible and skillful more or less for all the players . The cinematography and aforementioned cutting are masterful . Details captured , and the way in which the physical state is rendered . . . Christopher's career may have begun not too long ago , but I could definitely imagine that it will be worth following . It certainly has been so far . I recommend this to any fan of Nolan and / or Pacino .
450860	2093818	164212	7.0	Pretty good , well-acted , but the ending seems flat	For a crime-drama , this is quite good , and very well-acted . The plot is pretty good , has a good pace ( I don't think I was ever bored , not even a little ) , and is told in a good way . I really liked the non-linear , pause-action way of telling the story , in particular the recaps of the various points in the story that had impact in one way or another . The acting is very good ; Freeman , Hackman , Bellucci , Jane . . . all great . The performances are all completely convincing . The characters are credible and well-written . The dialog wasn't particularly fresh , but it was somewhat humorous , and did get a smirk from me every now and then . The editing and the cinematography is very good , especially in the recap sequences . It's not unique , but it's well-used , and it adds a new dimension to the film ( especially due to the constant changing nature of the recaps ) . The film has some great acting , some great cinematography , and great use of those two features , but it just seems to lose it when it tries to deliver the ending . I don't know if they didn't have a good idea how to end it , or if they suddenly had to change the planned ending for some reason . I know that this is based on a book , so that might have something to do with it . Maybe they didn't understand the books ending , maybe they didn't know how to execute it properly , who knows ? All I know is that whatever they tried to do with it , whatever emotion they tried to convey , they failed . All in all , a good film , but not great . It's worth sitting through the nearly 110 minutes for , anyway . I recommend this to fans of crime-dramas , and fans of the various main actors .
450714	2093818	265459	7.0	Utterly event-less , but apart from that , not bad	This may make you think twice about having the local place process your photos . This was neither something I had huge expectations for nor figured would turn out a major let-down . Just know that what I write in this review is not out of bitterness . With that said , this isn't a downright poor film . The big complaint I have about it is that , for the entire duration , from beginning to end . . . nothing , and I am not using hyperbole , not anything whatsoever , actually happens . The plot is fine , and save for one line obviously done to deliver exposition early on ( apart from which , there are only a few problems with the dialog ) , it's told decently . The pacing is OK . Acting is good , though I've seen both Vartan and Williams do better elsewhere . The latter's character is fairly well-written , if there could have been considerably more on-screen development ( and he's the one who was most fleshed out ) . I don't know exactly what the ending is supposed to be . Cinematography and editing are well-done . Romanek has evidently barely directed movies apart from this . I won't go out of my way to watch his other work , but I won't actively avoid it , either . I'm not making it my life's mission to view this again , but I won't have a problem with doing so . There is a little blood , some disturbing material , some graphic sexuality / nudity and the language isn't exactly restrained ( I'm referring more to how strong it can be than its quantity ) . I recommend this to fans of Mark Romanek , thrillers and / or the other people who worked on this .
450391	2093818	119528	7.0	Carrey at his best	I have to admit , I'm probably a little biased with this movie , as it contains two of the things I love the most in any movie ; court scenes and Jim Carrey . I'll try my best to be objective in this review , though . The plot is good , and as the film barely takes 90 minutes it's fairly fast-paced ( well , for a Jim Carrey comedy , anyway ) ; I don't think there ever passes 5 minutes without one single joke . The acting is fairly good ; Jim Carrey is in his element , so it's no surprise that he's good , but I did find both Maura Tierney and Cary Elwes pretty good too . I know that Elwes is English , not American , and after seeing another movie in which he has a strong English accent ( Robin Hood : Men in Tights ) , I was impressed at how well he does American parts as well . The characters are well-written and credible . The humor is great , partly because it's , well , Carrey , but also because unlike some of Carrey's previous roles , this is fairly " clean " , so teenagers and some kids will be able to enjoy it as well . The theme of the film is great ; I mean , we all know that we lie several times a day ( heck , it's even been scientifically proved ) , but what about if we , for one whole day , couldn't tell one single lie ? Great theme , provokes some thought and is executed fairly well in the film , though I do think it could have been done a tad better . Overall , I don't have any major complaints with the film though ; I guess it could be argued that most of what Carrey does in this film , the comedy and all , is stuff he's done before , but that's OK ; it's not any less entertaining here , regardless of the fact that we've seen it ( or something similar to it ) earlier . The dialog is great , with some very memorable and quotable lines . All in all , a typical Carrey film , which can be a good thing as well as bad ; Carrey does exactly what you expect him to , and he's very entertaining and all , but it never transcends the standard level of the typical Carrey comedy . On a final note , I think this ( as well as his other work ) proves that Tom Shadyac is the best there is at bringing out Carrey's talents ( he also directed Ace Ventura : Pet Detective and Bruce Almighty ) . I recommend it to any fan of Jim Carrey and / or Tom Shadyac .
450185	2093818	412915	7.0	By the book , but could be worse	I wouldn't say that I particularly enjoyed this , but I'm not going to claim that it isn't a fair piece of work . If you're into adventure , you may very well like this ( I'm not , hence . . . yeah ) . The plot is OK , pretty standard , formula stuff , and at times , it's predictable . The pacing is adequate . The acting is corny and over the top , intentionally or otherwise . I've seen even Wyle be more convincing elsewhere ( and I've only seen him in two other roles , from Enough and Donnie Darko ) . Hu isn't bad , but she barely has anything to do for almost ( but not entirely ) all of it . Newhart does get to do his thing a little bit , once or twice in this . The effects are quite the mixed bag . . . for being television , they are basically consistently good , considering , but you don't have to be looking to figure out how they did it , or what's CGI and what isn't ( in fact , to not , you might have to actually close your eyes ) . There is some action , and it's reasonable . The editing and cinematography are sufficient . This tends to be unconvincing . The references to other titles may induce cringing . I honestly wouldn't worry about the violence or imagery in this , the entire ordeal takes place in the world of no blood ( apart from S . W . A . T . , I'm not sure I've actually ever watched a film so obviously avoiding such ) . This couldn't be more obviously made-for-TV if every other line of dialog mentioned it . I recommend this to fans of the genre , and fabled artifacts and whatnot .
449890	2093818	458418	7.0	A lot in little time	If the main objective of any behind the scenes production is to inform , to further the viewer's knowledge regarding the title that it concerns itself with , then this isn't bad . Irene Bedard , the voice actress behind Pocahontas ( whenever she isn't singing ) , hosts this , and does fairly well , for most of her screen-time . We are told of the creative process , for animation , voice-work , researching and more . Russell Means , the voice of Powhatan , talks about how proud he is to be part of something so accurate about Native Americans . The host portions are shot in Virginia , at the actual Jamestown . What's really impressive here , what raises this above the norm , if not that high beyond it , is the amount of ground covered , as far as telling us about the film in question . In just under half an hour , quite a bit is said , and this is by far the strongest of the DVD extras for the Disney cartoon . It's honestly well-produced , with cinematography and editing that has actual , definite thought put behind it , which , sadly , makes it stand out from most of the other special features ( which , at best , are series of interviews inter-cut with footage , with some notable exceptions ) . I recommend this to any fan of the film . This is one of the handful of things that make the DVD worth it ( more than just a VHS copy ) .
449779	2093818	119396	7.0	Tame ending , and a less gratuitous than Tarantino's other films	Some would call this a tamer / toned down version of Pulp Fiction . . . I don't know . I guess it is , but the film is also more devoid of Tarantino's style than any of his other work . The non-linear time-line would be the prime example of this ; it's only used in a handful of scenes , rather than the one thing that keeps the film going , as is the case with one or two of his other films ( Reservoir Dogs , arguably Pulp Fiction ) . The film has much less violence , sex and drugs than any of his other films as well , which , together with the non-linear time-line , is Tarantino's trademark . However , in some ways , it lifted the film above expectations of the standard Tarantino production ; instead of sitting there , waiting for some shocking violence , I actually payed attention to the story , which is more than what I can say for Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction ( Kill Bill managed to juggle both things , Tarantino's style and a good , interesting plot perfectly , which is partly why I like it more ) . The problem with the plot , however , is that it's so damn confusing . . . if you don't pay perfect attention every single second of the way , you'll miss something . Normally , this would rate high with me , as I like films where it pays off to pay attention . . . only , this one doesn't . It doesn't pay off to pay attention , because the one reason there is to watch the movie , is to enjoy Tarantino's unique style , which , as I mentioned before , is not as present here as it is in his other movies . The ending is a anti-climax , and a powerful one , since it gives you exactly the ending you expect from the very start of the film , and you realize that you've just spent two and a half hours , watching something that ended exactly the way you knew it would end . Pulp Fiction ended unexpectedly , both in time and situation . Kill Bill had a great twist , at the end of each part / volume . Even Reservoir Dogs had a better ending than this . The plot is a pretty good , but a little too predictable , and it has almost as bad a pace as Pulp Fiction ; the thing that kept me watching was my enjoyment of Tarantino's style and the fact that I wasn't as confused by it as I was by Pulp Fiction . The predictability might have something to do with me having seen so many other Tarantino's films , but it still should have surprised me more ; all of his other films surprised me , some more than others , but all surprised me at some point or another . The characters are well-written , like with most of Tarantino's other work . The dialog is also about as good as Tarantino's other films . The soundtrack is also pretty good , but it's inferior to his other films , in my opinion . The actors are all well-cast . Hmmm . . . what else . . . I don't know , all in all , it's just a typical Tarantino film , with the twist that it's in several ways different from , uh , the typical Tarantino film . That's pretty much it . If you're into Tarantino's style , you'll enjoy it , but you have to love his films and style to really love it . I recommend it to fans of Tarantino , who are up for a slightly different film from what he usually does .
450581	2093818	368574	7.0	See ? He doesn't have to be annoying	The fourth of the Animatrix shorts , this is one of those of them that ties closely into the trilogy , specifically , the sequels . This provides the background for The Kid , seen in the second two movies , and he's genuinely not irritating in this ( no , seriously ) . The concept is highly interesting , although , for obvious reasons , this should not be seen by anyone too likely to imitate it , anyone whose behavior is that easily influenced . The animation is well-done and quite interesting , with a style of limited motion in the drawings , and the camera being responsible for a lot of the movement , in a way that feels reminiscent of regular , live-action films . The atmosphere is impeccable , and the pace is spot-on throughout . The voice acting is great , Watson does well with what few lines he has , as do Anne-Moss and Reeves . The idea and execution of this are excellent , and this is a remarkable addition to the overall universe . This has a making of , shared with Detective Story , which is well-done and informative . It's 9 and a half minutes , same as the short itself . This has one disturbing aspect , nothing objectionable beyond that . I recommend this to any fan of The Matrix franchise and / or science fiction in general .
450570	2093818	298203	7.0	Pretty good semi-autobiographical drama , but could have been better	Being that this is his first big role in a feature film , I was excited to see how well Eminem could act . I'm happy to say that he pulls it off perfectly . I didn't even think about that it was Eminem in the lead role , as he portrays his character perfectly . Even though it's similar to his real personality , it must have been hard for him . The rest of the actors mostly perform well too , actually pretty much everybody except Kim Basinger is completely believable . Unfortunately , she seems a bit out of place in this film , and she didn't portray her character too believably , in my opinion . The plot is interesting and keeps your attention , for the duration of the film . The characters are all believable . The cinematography is excellent ; it really makes you feel that you're there , in every single scene , in every battle . Being a rap fan , I really enjoyed the rap music aspect of the film too , though I guess people who aren't into rap will dislike big parts of the film . I also felt that the ex-girlfriend subplot was a bit underdeveloped ; it could have been take a bit further . Apart from that , and the acting of Kim Basinger , this couldn't have been much better . I really liked that it wasn't entirely autobiographical , that would have been predictable and probably boring , especially for us fans of Eminem who know his background well . I like what they did with the theme , and where they took the plot . Overall , a pretty good drama that could have been better . I'd recommend this to most fans of dramas , and fans of hip-hop / rap / Eminem .
449891	2093818	114148	7.0	A mature animated Disney feature , and a beautiful film	This is somewhat unique , for a number of reasons . Perhaps most importantly , it is , as my summary states , mature . Gone are the talking animals , the show-stopping musical number ( as were a staple of the Disney cartoons of the time ) , and the themes , the tone , is more serious . This is the only Disney animated feature actually based on a true event . There is still humor that the children can laugh at , and it's still much more simple and easy to take in than a lot of entertainment , but this has things for the grown-ups , as well . This seems to have lead to it being somewhat overlooked and less popular with kids . Another difference is how realistic the look is . The characters , the movements , faces , everything , it all looks far more real than other animated pieces . The animation is magnificent . The colors are used well , and quite subtly , in key sequences . The acting is good , and Bedard and Kuhn , the speaking and singing voice of the title character , respectively , are both excellent . Gibson isn't a bad singer , and he fits the character of Smith , both in attitude and voice . The majority of the actors lending their voices to the Indian characters are actual Native Americans , which is definitely an impressive and note-worthy detail . The music is great . Characterization is nicely done . For a film that's about an hour and fifteen minutes , sans credits , we know more about these people , and understand them better , than you'd expect . The plot is well-written , but of course it is a fictional recounting of the actual story ( this is Disney , after all ) . The pacing is marvelous , it never really drags . The DVD extras are a mixed bag . . . not all are well-produced or aesthetically appealing ( or even introduced properly ) . The multi-language reel , though , is well-cut and well-done , both idea and execution get high marks . . . although as much as I dislike Danish dubbing , I'm not sure that I was as relieved as I was insulted that the Danish voice was not part of it ; the Swedish and Norwegian were ! Also , the interactive adventure can amuse , and may inform . I recommend this to anyone willing to watch Disney , especially the more mature audiences .
450268	2093818	1003269	7.0	The world of Flux	This is a featurette on Æon Flux , featured , obviously , on said film's DVD . It's comprised of film-clips , interviews , behind-the-scenes footage and we are even treated to some clips from the original show . Even the creator of the show is animated ( I understand that he wasn't particularly pleased with the end result of the movie being created . . . and he does talk about how little he had to do with it , while David Gale , one of the producers , seems to feel that he , Chung , the creator , did gain something from the experience ) . The director has some decent enough things to say , though her definition of sci-fi as a genre seems off . . . what she says seems to apply more to fantasy . Hurd , another of the producers , on the other hand , gets it and explains it perfectly . Talked about is the way the world of the film is done ( at at least one point , it seems like the two writers didn't agree fully , I could be wrong , I suppose ) , and how different a take on the genre it is ( as well as what they feel the core is . . . revealing it could be considered a spoiler ) . Outright ridiculous it only really gets when it is claimed that the piece " reinvents " the genre ( come on , Hurd , you're smarter than this , you worked on both Terminator films . . . ! Yes , in my mind , T3 never actually happened , and I'm not sure ( as far as what I accept to be true goes ) there are any plans to make more , either ) . This is well-edited and has fine pacing . It has some good inside stuff , and if you can keep from giggling at all the people talking about how much better their movie is than the science fiction masterpieces , it's not bad . I recommend this to anyone who wants to know more about the film .
450036	2093818	157503	7.0	Pretty good black comedy spoofing teen beauty contests	When I first sat down to watch this , I was quick to judge it as a dud . About ten or twenty minutes into it , I suddenly started to love pretty much every second of it . It doesn't last every single second of the movie , but most of it is really funny . If you're into black humor you should definitely check it out . All of the main characters have a very distinct dialect for the entire movie , which at first seems annoying , but eventually you grow to love it , and laugh at it . The acting is mostly acceptable , as most the characters are laughable stereotypes . The movie is very black , one of the most pitch black I've ever seen , so if you don't think you can stand extreme black humor , or you're easily offended , you should definitely avoid this film . It isn't for everybody's taste , and most people probably won't like it . It's gold for any fan of black humor though , if you like a movie like One night at McCools , you'll probably like this one too . It's made in the style of a documentary , I think the genre is called " mockumentary " . Once again , not for everyones taste , but worth watching for fans of black humor .
450100	2093818	426160	7.0	They pull it off	This is mainly noteworthy on account of how little they had to work with , and how impressive the result is . They had little time and limited set , and what they put together actually does work . The plot isn't bad , and there is enough of it to keep this going for the duration of it . This is a sit-com , with the very unusually chosen back-drop of a dictator state , with the typical characters , types and line of jokes . The camera-work and tone emulate the sub-genre of television-based comedy , and save for perhaps one visual gag ( which does become apparent when the punch-line is reached , but if a joke hasn't been realized by the audience before that point . . . ) , there's very little to criticize in this department . It is somewhat uneven , and , possibly partially due to how short it is , characterization isn't a strong suit of this . The material varies in quality , but it tends to be consistent in style ( if not always terribly logical , there's at least one point . . . ) , but the players aren't bad , they embrace it for the very most part . Sound is fine . Editing is more or less spot-on . I recommend this to fans of shorts , indies , Sanderson and / or sitcoms .
449980	2093818	122933	7.0	Funny enough	The idea behind this seems simple enough . . . almost obvious . Have Billy Crystal do his fast-talking , neurotic and repressed thing , cast him as a psychiatrist , and have this psychiatrist have to work with a patient that he would not at all want to work with , yet make it " an offer he can't refuse " . Put de Niro in the role of an emotional mob boss . We all know he can do both that part and comedic roles in general . Heck , as a bonus , there's plenty of opportunity of psychiatry jokes . The movie is actually entertaining enough . The two stars fit well together , and their on-screen chemistry is sufficient . The movie keeps you entertained throughout , though there are occasional slow spots . The material is hit and miss , but most of it is funny . Kudrow was less wacky than I had anticipated . The acting in general is pretty good , and Palminteri gets some great moments . Dialog is good , mostly . Language is . . . free-spirited , let's put it that way . All in all , a funny enough film , worth a watch . I recommend this to any fan of the actors involved as well as anyone the plot appeals to .
450348	2093818	463503	7.0	The review of someone who's hardly been to a concert in his life	I've never really " gotten " concerts . Fear not , review-reader , I shall not bore you with details about why , nor delve into some story which intends to make you go " ohhh " and completely understand . . . I merely wish to say up front that this review was written entirely by a man who's just barely been to any concerts , at all , because he did not wish to . I may focus more on the filmic aspects . I first got into Eminem's music back in the early 2000s ( possibly 2000 or 2001 ) , after listening through The Marshall Mathers LP . My interest in his music may very well have been the basis of me purchasing this DVD . The DVD is comprised of a one hour , ten minute ( give or take some minutes , but sans credits , that's about the length ) documentary , following Mr . Shady and D12 on the All Access Europe tour , two bonus performances ( Purple Pills and Forgot About Dre , both are well-done ) and a still gallery ( which is nice , though it is automated , you don't skip back and forth between them , yourself , they run on their own , with a rap running in the background ) . It all comes to over an hour and a half . There are no subtitles , and obviously no alternate audio tracks ( based on the Region 2 release ) . The documentary is good , it utilizes his music ( featured are raps from both of the albums he had released by this point , the one I mentioned earlier , and his first release , The Slim Shady LP , and some of what he made with his five fellow rappers ( R . I . P . , Bugz and now also Proof . . . Slim , take care , man , you two seemed close ) , from the album Devil's Night ( the only one they had released by this time ) ) well , and features both performances and footage of behind the . . . stage , the rappers kicking back , making jokes and such . There are also bits of a couple interviews . It's nicely edited , rather tight , and the performances are nicely covered . . . they include The Way I Am , featuring Marilyn Manson ( who only appears in the performance ) , and Stan , featuring Dido . It's funny , provided you like Em and The Dirty Dozen . It's well-paced and never really loses your interest , if you're a fan . Obviously , there is some language . . . there is also some drug content , but no real violence or sex ( the closest to the last-mentioned is a stroll taken down that street in Amsterdam ) . The end credits have Marshall telling us ( audio only ) how his career began , and this is also available under the Special Features menu . I recommend this to any fan of the rappers , in particular our favorite angry white boy , the title performer . This may be best suited for those who like tours and concerts , or at least to be in the audience of such .
449794	2093818	113987	7.0	Good film , no doubt about that , but pretty much only for those who know just about everything there is to know about Nixon	After sitting through this painfully long and very drawn-out film , I can't help but feel that it is just slightly . . . redundant . I watched this with my father , who actually followed Nixon's career to some extent , and I can't deny that without his giving me cliff notes to explain actions and motivation of the characters every so often during the film , I wouldn't understand any of what happened . And that's the sad truth . . . if you don't know almost everything about Nixon , his time , the political situation , what happened during that period of time , etc . you won't understand it . The film hints at so many things , instead of making what happens clear , and presumes you know everything behind every situation , instead of providing any back-story . We get scene after scene , one situation after another with people we're supposed to know beforehand , situations we're expected to know of and understand and if you don't know of these , and you have no way of knowing them , you certainly won't know after watching the film . The film really isn't the story of Richard M . Nixon as much as it's Oliver Stone's objective presentation of him . How are we supposed to judge this man , his staff , or any of their actions when we don't know the situation or the background of it ? Then there are of course those who do know these things . . . but why would they watch it ? They already know the things presented in the movie , and probably from a far more reliable source . So , I guess what it comes down to is : who is this film actually aimed at ? Who can watch this and really enjoy it ? My father suggested that Stone's intention with this film was to tell the story to young Americans , teenagers who weren't even alive when what the film is about happened . A good cause , but again , it requires them to already know of Nixon . And that is ultimately this movies downfall . The plot is very good , and from what I understand , quite accurate . The pacing is . . . off , I think is the right word . It switches between going insanely fast and painfully slow , making the film a sure-fire head-ache machine . The acting is perfectly flawless , and most , if not all of the characters based on real people are historically accurate in personality and appearance . The time-line is somewhat messed up , but the basic idea is that Nixon is actually sitting and thinking back on all this stuff , so it makes perfect sense and is used nicely ( as opposed to as a cheap gimmick ) . The film is good , definitely , it's just so limited in who it will appeal to , and the pacing is a real killer ( and I don't mean that in the good way ) . I recommend this to anyone who is interested in Nixon and big fans of Oliver Stone . I suppose very big fans of members of the cast might want to give it a chance as well .
450187	2093818	365601	7.0	Done well	This is a featurette found on the 2-Disc Special Edition DVD of The Terminator . It's also one of the best and most memorable that I've ever seen ( I freely admit that part of that may be due to me very much liking and enjoying the film itself ) . Technically speaking , it's well-done . It consists of clips from the movie , interviews ( at times these seem odd , since some of the people had multiple interviews from different times ) and footage from the making of it , as well as storyboards and conceptual art . Members of every aspect of putting it together get to speak , and you see all three stages of production ( pre , during and post , for the uninitiated ) . I wouldn't complain if Biehn had gotten to talk more , but I simply find him so cool , I'm not sure there is an upper limit to that . Many of the crew and actors have interesting and good things to say , and the anecdotes are just great . They are a big reason for this being such a marvelous documentary . Several of them are rather funny , and among those told are genuinely inspiring ones . There is a bit of the usual love-fest , but it isn't too bad , nor is there a terrible lot of it . There are some disturbing images in this , mainly from the title , or in the concepts for it . I recommend this to fans of Jim , Michael , " and the rest " , not to mention anyone wanting to know about the creating of the piece .
450765	2093818	102926	8.0	Good , but inferior to Se7en	Hannibal Lecter . The name that will spark interest , gain recognition , and most likely send a chill down your spine . He's one of the most interesting and well-known fictional serial killers , and this is probably the movie that manages to do him most justice . Anthony Hopkins as the serial killer , psychiatrist and cannibal was a great casting decision . He definitely performed the role as perfectly as it could be done . However , when it comes to the overall quality of the film , it just doesn't entirely measure up . The plot is good , and evolves at a pretty good pace ; however , I couldn't manage to sit through the entire thing . . . I only barely made it , half-attentive , through the first 45 minutes . I couldn't even sit through more than ' s of the movie , let alone the whole thing . Now , this may be because I've seen it many times in the past years , but usually , when I can't sit through a movie because I have seen it before , it's due to my remembering most of the key parts of the movie , and not being surprised by it . . . but not this movie ; I can say , in entire honesty , that I didn't remember or even recognize any of the film , despite having seen it plenty of times before , about one time a year . If I remember anything from a movie , that I haven't seen for a long time , it's because it had an impact on me ; for example , I still haven't forgotten the twist of the famous Hitchcock horror-thriller , Vertigo , despite the fact that I've seen it once , and that was about five years ago . Nothing in this movie had an impact on me , nothing affected me deeply . Maybe I'm hard to impress , maybe I am too hardened by worse films . . . but still . The film involves sick and disturbing characters and actions ; it should have an impact on the viewer . Maybe I'm not smart enough to get it ; maybe I keep expecting the film to be very different from what it was . . . I don't know . I just didn't find this film as good as it has been made out to be . The acting is very good ; Hopkins nails the role of Lecter perfectly . Foster is good , too . Both portray their roles convincingly , and make their characters and their actions credible . The characters are well-written , credible and , well , colorful . Buffalo Bill makes a great villain , very psychotic and disturbing . Levine also gives a very good performance . All in all , a pretty good horror-thriller , but inferior to Se7en ( arguably the best of the genre ) , and only enjoyable for people who can appreciate the psychological aspects of the film ( which I guess I can't ) . I recommend it exclusively to people who can enjoy a very psychological thriller-horror piece .
449787	2093818	239023	8.0	A decade after , the impact is still clear	I base this on the GOTY ( Game of the Year . . . it was awarded that title in ' 98 , and one can still figure out why ) version , and on the PC release . For years after FPS's started being made , after Wolfenstein 3D , the growth was slow , and fairly obvious . Then this came . Marking itself as a big step away from the arcade feel of the predecessors , this was made highly realistic . The way it starts , how it is throughout , at next to no point in all of this is the following not true : It comes off as less of a VG , and more like , well , real life . Heck , this begins with you coming in to work . Of course , you have a really interesting job , and something happens that shapes the rest of this . This doesn't have shiny pick-ups , and all that there are , appear in places you'd expect to find them , ammo not just lying about , but in boxes and on shelves , near dead bodies . There is not technically a single cut-scene in this . . . rather , what will happen is that events occur , and you can overhear conversations ( and a lot of them , you will be directly talked to ) , yet without the angle ever changing ( in all of this ) , and you can still move around , often with whomever is addressing you continually looking towards you . You get to decide from where you want to look at it , and you catching them all depends on you being aware of your surroundings , making for fantastic immersion . Story-telling is well-done , with some being directly explained to you by NPC's , and the rest being discovered , all with the 360 degrees of viewing freedom . They even explain the HUD , as well as the reason you can keep going after being attacked and otherwise taking damage . This has an actual , genuine plot , and it's smart and develops well , to boot . The level design is impeccable , and the fact that this is almost completely linear is hidden nicely . The length is appropriate , and it doesn't overstay its welcome . This manages to combine intense action , a mesmerizing other world ( alongside ours ) , disturbing and creatively done creatures , atmosphere , horror and more incredibly well . The audio is well-done , with well-composed , fitting score , voice acting that is above average and sounds that are all well-chosen and well-done . Puzzle solving , with logical and well-thought out tasks , is part of this . This never gets stale . It helps that there are so many and such different enemies . This was one of the first times AI in something like this was really more than scripted movements and such . There are foes in this that will follow you , work together in teams to try to take you down , using grenades , taking cover , and in general using bona-fide tactics against you . They'll adapt and provide challenge . The arms also demand mention . . . there is not a single weapon in this that is not useful , and almost all of them have secondary fire . Short or long range , fast or accurate , powerful or not as much , there are so many variations , and with a dozen or so specific means of eliminating what you're up against , including , but not limited to , an assault rifle with grenade launcher , a revolver , tripwire mines , explosives you can detonate at will , a shotgun , as well as a couple of exotic entries , not to mention some that allow , to an extent , shooting around corners , you can pretty much pick how you want to dispose of the next group you fight . The graphics are maybe a little dated today , but they are well-done . Purchasing Blue Shift , which holds a High Definition pack ( and that's about all the reason there is to get that particular product ) that applies to this and Opposing Force , as well , helps . The effects are mixed , though with muzzle flashes and , sometimes , fire , being well-done . The entire engine is great , as evidenced also by the massive amount of user-made modifications , mods , that have come out since this did . This was also one of the first to make using them easy . . . it has a menu for them . The multi-player is also well-done , allowing for Free-For-All and Team Deathmatch in plenty of arenas . This has a training portion , the Hazard Course , that teaches you nearly everything you need to know and be able to in order to complete this , even going over movement and such , so if this is the first you play , that can prepare you . You can return to that anytime , and practice or remind yourself how to do something . The re-playability is almost entirely in the three difficulty settings . If you are unsure if this is for you , I would advise trying the " Uplink " ( the demo ) , free of charge . It gives you a sense of what the full thing is like , without it just being a part of it , but instead unique . This has humor , and it doesn't go overboard . There is a well-done loading feature , allowing for large , fairly extensive areas with no problems . It makes use of this , with taking you through a number of grand and well-done locations . Saving can be done anywhere and anytime you want in this . The boss battles are well-done and satisfying , without being overly frustrating . You can , in this , ask those on your side to follow you or stay put , and this is easily accessible , and used well in this , as some of them help you by opening doors ( so keep them alive ! ) , and those that have guns , use them to help you out , and / or defend themselves . That feature is used well . There are , unfortunately , numerous bugs and glitches in this , the least of them being clipping . They can be troublesome , and at times the stability even suffers . There is a little language in this , of moderate strength . There is relative violence and gore , and it is definitely not for children . I recommend this to any fan of First Person Shooters , especially those who want it to be a step up from Doom ( it is fun , yes , don't get me wrong , it's just simple ) and / or science fiction .
450943	2093818	175880	8.0	Heavy-handed and slow , but not without its moments and definitely interesting	When George C . Scott was approached for a part in this film and shown the script , he exclaimed " The language is terrible . " I disagree . The language is real . The dialog is true-to-life . We don't , or , very rarely , at least , always say the right thing , and we often repeat ourselves and say stupid , pointless things when making a point or being in a situation we can't control . Contrary to what you might think , this doesn't mean that the dialog is tedious . It may take some getting used to , but you realize that it is much better than typical Hollywood dialog . . . because words don't convey our emotions the same way body-language and behavior does . Writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson obviously knew that , and used it in this film . I haven't seen any of his other work , but I will . Now , this film is character-driven , and that is its biggest strength , and its main reason for failing in some parts . It's a long film , but it's not overlong ( maybe a little in the end , but the first two hours are hardly ever boring ) . It's a film with non-Hollywood dialog , but this is just something to get used to . The problem lies undeniably in the character-driven nature of the film . Some big films have many , many characters . This one , however , has many , many main characters . This means that there are about 15 people that you have to remember , learn of , and follow throughout the three-hour run-time of this film . This means that you probably won't be able to pick up everything on the first viewing , and , more importantly , there will most likely be at least one character that you dislike , maybe even strongly . This makes every scene with them hard to sit through , and their very presence in the movie can make you annoyed with it . For me , it was Jim Kurring . He was just so pitifully annoying and unbearable . He can't tolerate ' bad language ' , he has the most annoying blind faith , and he just seems generally retarded . What's worse is his narration and his lack of charm or charisma . He's the guy you avoid in real life , but act nice around because you don't want him to know how badly you hate him . The film has some very heavy-handed symbolism and some seemingly pointless scenes , that could easily have been written out or cut with no real effect on the film . I enjoyed the first two thirds considerably more than the last . The scenes near the end . . . I won't put what happens here , but it just seemed pointless and stupid . The film didn't seem to have a real ending . . . nothing is really resolved . No questions answered , no solutions given . It's basically just a story about all of these people , and that's it . I don't know if I expected the ending of the film to hold some major surprise ( well , that it did , I admit ) or an explanation , but it just seemed kind of pointless in the end . " But it did happen . " Yes , but why ? Are we supposed to take some moral lesson out of all of this , or is it just a study of different persons and strange coincidences ? What makes a magnificent drama , I think , is if it offers a commentary on something that we all know , or pushes through an important point . . . One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has the beautiful message of freedom and fighting for it , Citizen Kane shows how important love is to any man . . . but what does this movie show ? What message is it trying to convey ? I can't seem to pin-point it . Maybe I need to think more about the film . . . maybe there is none . That doesn't make it a bad drama , but it prevents it from being a truly remarkable one , I think . The plot is very good and well-written . The pacing is good , at least for the first two hours . . . after that , it seemed to slide a little downwards . The acting is flawless . Absolutely flawless . From the biggest star to the least seen extra . . . not one performance was unsatisfactory . Not even the child actors . The characters are well-written and credible . All in all , a very good drama , but not a perfect one and not as impressive as some shorter films . I recommend it to fans of dramas , but I will say that it takes some effort from the viewer to enjoy and it is kind of an acquired taste . It's also a bit slow , after the first two hours .
450125	2093818	167190	8.0	Great , one of the best comic book movies	I really enjoyed this film ; and believe me , that's not easy to say , since I expected to hate it , as I have hated the other Guillermo Del Toro films I've seen ( Blade II , Mimic ) . It met all of my expectations , and surpassed several of them . It has all of the elements that a good comic book movie needs ; the action , the character development , the interesting and well-developed characters . . . everything ; and pretty much all of it was exceptionally well-done . The plot is pretty good ; standard stuff for a comic book movie ( learn of origin , fight the end of the world ) , but it has a good , intense pace , while still bringing some good " buffer " scenes , that allow the audience to relax and exhale , after an intense and very well-made action scene . The acting is all great , especially by the four leads ; Ron Perlman , John Hurt , Selma Blair and Rupert Evans . The characters are well-written , interesting and well-developed . I really liked the way the main characters aren't depicted as " perfect " , or " heroes " ; they don't always do what's right , and they aren't invulnerable . Many action scenes end with one or more of the main characters getting seriously hurt or injured . The action is well-done and very well-choreographed . I also really liked the villains ; they were cool , at least as interesting as the heroes / good guys , and evil as hell . The special effects are great , not the best I've seen , but among the best . There were only one or two times where the CGI was easy to tell apart from the live-action , and you wouldn't notice it if you didn't look very hard . The script is well-written , there are plenty of character developing scenes , plenty of action , and plenty of comedy ( you gotta love the wisecracking Hellboy ) ; there wasn't really any point during the film where I felt bored , or was in any way heavily disappointed with what was on-screen . The film dodges most cliches and cop-outs , stuff that comic book movies are usually packed with . The one thing I didn't care too much for was Del Toro's usual personal touch ( which I loathed in both Mimic and Blade II ) ; his affection for seemingly pointless , ongoing gore sequences . The guy apparently can't make a single movie without having some disgusting corpse or something similar be dissected / cut up / mangled / whatever , in detail , on-screen . It really annoys me . In this one , however , I can forgive him , because in this one , what we see in extreme detail was the one most cool-looking character in the film , so I didn't mind it too much . It still is kind of ridiculous that this guy can't make a movie without putting that in , though . Nonetheless , this film is great . I recommend any fan of Del Toro , comic book movies , and possibly the comic itself , Hellboy , to see it .
450323	2093818	384783	8.0	Even more videos by Al , and this time . . . there're specials !	Since Al hadn't made the last of his videos by ' 96 , it made sense to release this , an updated compilation music video DVD , and this time , they put some special features on , as well . Two of these are more things you can watch . . . a live performance of Another One Rides The Bus on something called The Tomorrow Show , from 1981 , where Al has the music side ( in addition to himself on the accordion ) helped by his partner , Jon Schwartz playing , among other things , a piece of luggage ( it'll make sense when you see it . . . no , seriously , it will ) , and some select clips of The Weird Al Show ( which are amusing and very " Al " ) , including the intro ( which is really good ) . In total , these come to about eight minutes , bringing the full running time of this DVD up to one hour and about 33 minutes . Also featured is a photo gallery with production stills of the various videos . Lastly , there are subtitles for all of the viewable material ( lyrics whenever something is sung ) , and while these may not get everything right ( I can't for sure tell if they do or not ) , they're good to have and a great help for following the songs ( and hey , if you don't like them , they can be turned off , ah , the wonder of the medium of DVD ) . Of course , there are also the three new videos from the master of absurd comedy and parody-making ; Bob , which will have you marveled at how many palindromes Al could find and make work ( to spoof the incomprehensible singing of Bob Dylan ) , It's All About The Pentiums , Baby ( featuring Drew Carey , no less , presumably due to being connected to sitting in a cubicle ) , which is a rather skillful re-writing of It's All About The Benjamins , Baby , to make P . Diddy's song be about computers rather than making money , and finally , The Saga Begins , which retells the story of Star Wars : Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace , in a fairly straight-forward manner . The flow of the videos isn't bad . The menus are set up well , and it's easy to find your way around , though the video selection could perhaps be better , it's too easy get lost in . All in all , definitely worth owning for any fan of Weird Al . If it's this or ' Weird Al Yankovic : The Videos , for the same price , I'd advise you to choose this . I recommend this to any fan of Weird Al Yankovic and / or parody songs / videos .
450400	2093818	105236	8.0	A stylish and excellent example of expert story-telling .	After watching this half a dozen times with a biased , anti-Tarantino , " what the heck is so great about this guy , anyway " view ( which , as most anyone watching any film with that view and a fair bit of self-knowledge will tell you , is a rather fruitless practice in pointlessness . . . if you've decided you're not going to like it , there's very little reason to think that you will , no matter how good it is ; you need an open mind ) , I finally decided to give it a fair hearing . . . and I saw it for what it is . An unusual film , at least for its time . A stylish film full of cool dialog , cinematography , editing and music . The whole thing comes together perfectly and is very short of creating a sublime film experience . The plot is excellently written and told . The pace is perfect . I wasn't bored for a second , nor did I ever really want it to move faster or slower . The cinematography is magnificent , and incredibly well-integrated . Pans , dolly trips and , lest we forget , the stationary shots . . . all perfectly used . Very stylized . The acting is top-notch all-round . With most of the cast being name actors , this is no surprise , but they really do shine . Madsen , Buscemi , Keitel , Roth . . . all incredible . The one role that had less than good . . . well , let's be honest , it had rather awful acting . I'm speaking , of course , of Tarantino's character . Now , don't get me wrong ; in From Dusk Till Dawn , this man did great . But just about any other time I've seen him act , he just doesn't seem to have the first clue . Being a film-maker myself ( albeit on somewhat of a smaller scale than Quentin ) , I can relate to wanting to cast yourself in a role . . . but sometimes , you just need to face up to the facts , and admit it if you can't act . Still , that is a minor complaint . Another one might be that there are at least two fairly big characters that seem completely and entirely expendable . . . they had no real role in the action and could very , very easily have been cut with no real loss to the overall product . I won't name them here , but anyone who's seen the film will know who I'm talking about . All the characters , however , are well-written and their actions credible . Tarantino knows his stuff when it comes to writing . . . something that also shows in the dialog , which , although somewhat drawn-out at times , is exceptional . Well-delivered , too . When it comes to direction , he shows how talented he is , as well . The film is very well put together . The editing is great , with the non-linear time-line telling the story far better than a " regular " film ever could . One of the many Tarantino-fans , in fact , the very person who originally talked me into watching this film , once told me that he had heard of someone editing films with such time-lines - this , Pulp Fiction , Memento , etc . - so that their time-lines were perfectly linear . I'm sorry , I entirely respect their right to do such a thing . . . and I won't claim that their doing so has less artistic value than the original films in any way . . . but I refuse to watch that . A big part of this being so well-told lies in the time-line . Also , I'm a firm believer of watching something the way the makers intended it . Don't edit , don't censor , don't make your own version and pass it off as anything but just that . . . your own version , and not the original . Sorry , rant over . Finally , I just need to comment on the music . . . the soundtrack of this is just great . Tarantino collected so many amazing 70's tunes for this film and used them great . All in all , just a really , really good film . Very little keeps this from being a perfect ten , most of which I've covered here . I recommend this to anyone who can stomach the violence and who likes their films with a side of style .
450299	2093818	348150	8.0	Astounding , if slightly overlong , superhero film	I watched this shortly after viewing the ' 78 film . Within half an hour of the end credits rolling of that , the opening ones of this came on . Therefore , I have an unusually clear memory ( and basis of comparison ) of the first . From the first frame ( literally . . . as the credits roll at the beginning of the film ) , I could tell that Singer is a definite fan of the original . As the film progressed , it was also proved without a doubt that he's a fan of the character . For a revival film , for restarting a franchise , this couldn't really have been much better of a superhero / Superman movie ( as far as I can tell , from my non-fan view , and having only seen the first film prior to this ) . The in-jokes and references to the first are quite funny , if there are arguably a tad too many of them . The plot is well-written , explains the various changes and developments nicely . . . and I , for one , love the way it uses the first as a starting point . The acting is all good . Routh is fitting as both Superman and Clark Kent . Bosworth seemed too young a Lois Lane to me . Kevin Spacey basically is Lex Luthor . There was less energy put in his performance than the trailer suggested , which is a shame , but he's still marvelous . Posey provides some good comic relief and shows off some of her somewhat seldom seen acting talent . The characters are fairly well-developed . Kent is less clumsy here . The pacing is solid . There are drawn-out scenes , but the action more than makes up for them . . . and I was never actually bored or hoping it would end soon ( though I will admit that the film may be as much as half an hour too long ) . The cinematography is quite good . . . the camera takes on a panicky shaking during several of the intense scenes , but it never really seems overdone . The action is exciting and breathtaking . The visuals are stunning . . . the effects are amazing . You truly will believe that a man can fly . Yes , one or two of the subplots may have been unnecessary , but the end result , what it all comes down to , is a pretty solid film . You can watch this without having seen any of the others , though I would recommend watching the first . . . first . I recommend this to any fan of the character , of superhero films in general and / or of the 1978 movie . Highly enjoyable .
450785	2093818	424205	8.0	Moving	I was looking forward to finding out how this historical yet forgotten event would be put to film , and how accurately it would be depicted . I am not disappointed . This evokes emotion without ever slipping into sentimentality or sap . It personalizes without robbing the true occurrence of attention . There is focus put on certain characters ( all of which are quite well-written ) , but never to the point of such being lost on what really happened . The plot is great , and develops well . Some liberties are taken with the story , and they are not all justified , but the core is kept intact , and this manages to both tell what happened and make us feel and care about it . The overdubbed singing could have been subjected to better synchronization , but there is little to any criticisms directed at the acting itself . The same goes for the production value . The technical aspects of this are excellent , as well . The cinematography and editing are just about flawless . Pacing is rather good . Writing and directing are commendable . All three sides each speak the actual languages , adding to the already well-established sense of realism . I recommend this to anyone interested in the period , and the specific situation in particular .
450399	2093818	113581	8.0	Very well-executed and interesting	I first saw this three-part mini-series when I was this tall ( not to be confused with " high " . . . I was shorter , not under the influence ) , 11 years ago . . . more than half a life-time , with my current age . No , I won't start talking about ' the old days ' or start talking about how things were when I was young . My point is ( yes , amongst all this rambling , there is a point . . . somewhere . Honest ! ) , even then , at the tender age of 9 , I was strongly affected by this . So much so that I still remembered much of it today , when I re-watched it . I recognized much of it . Not as much story as simply themes , ideas in it . Detailing the young life of Lise Nørgaard , the great contemporary Danish writer , this runs at nearly three hours . . . and there is not a boring second to be found . The pacing is near-perfect , with both drama-heavy scenes and slower ones to allow the viewer to take in the events . The plot is thoroughly well-written and revolves around the first thirty years of the famous author's life . . . during which , she is neglected , ignored and overlooked until she finally rebels , and fights back , against her parents , the male-dominated society and everyone who doubts her abilities and are bewildered by the magnitude of her ambitions , as well as the very fact that she harbors any at all . . . simply because of her gender . The acting is very good . There is fairly little dialog , so much of this is told through acting ( requiring quite a bit of talent , and some of it is even limited to facial expressions , not body language ) and cinematic effects . Events are hinted at , mentioned in passing by characters and shown . . . but rarely ever littered with dialog . The cinematography is marvelous . . . with relatively few cuts , long takes and nicely planned dolly trips . Great attention to detail and some extensive research makes this a rather remarkable period piece , as well ( spanning over 30 years , no less ) . The film has very high production values . The editing has its moments , times where it is simply superb ( one particular sequence is rather reminiscent of one in the Brian De Palma film The Untouchables ) . . . but much of the time , the cinematography does the job , leaving little to cut from or to . The sound work is nice , though , with a few sounds exaggerated for effect and a great score ( not to mention soundtrack ) . The orchestral score works perfectly to enhance the emotions on the screen , whether genuine or slightly overplayed , as an early scene intentionally is . The jazz-packed soundtrack works excellently to underscore later scenes , and it fits perfectly due to it being contemporary . In spite of this being a Danish production , there is little tacky humor , and this really comes across as far more serious , touching and strong than just about any other Danish production , with the possible ( well , let's be honest ; probable ) exception of last years Mørke ( Murk , in English ) . Featuring deep insight , solid social commentary and very good characterizations , this ranks as one of my very favorite Danish film experiences , and , in my humble opinion , one of the best of them . I recommend this to fans of drama , period pieces surrounding the time this is set in ( between 1917 and 1947 ) and / or the actors and filmmakers involved in making it .
450941	2093818	117958	8.0	Not much plot , but a very interesting study of the environment of alcoholics	I've been a fan of the diverse and clearly talented actor Steve Buscemi for quite a while , ever since I first saw Con Air back in ' 99 . Naturally , when I heard he'd directed and written a movie by himself , starring him , I wanted to see it . I found this to be more of a drama than a comedy , but it didn't really bother me . It didn't have much of a plot , but that didn't bother me either . The film is about Tommy ( Buscemi ) who's an alcoholic . He just lost his job , and his boss took over his pregnant girlfriend . So , what should he do ? Going to the local bar is probably low on the list of good ideas , but that's what he does . The plot is almost non-existent . . . then again , there's plenty of back-story to make up for it , and the movie has a pretty good pace , even though it moves kind of slow . The movie is primarily a study of the environment of alcoholics , and as such , it's great . Just great . There's tons of little details , thrown in here and there that don't really add to the plot , but rather to said study . The acting is mostly great . Buscemi is great , as always , and some of the supporting actors are equally good ; Baldwin and Sevigny , in particular . The characters are well-written and credible . The humor is a rarity in the film , but it is mainly a drama . Also , what little there is , is great . The environment presented is entirely realistic and accurate . There isn't really anything about it that seemed to just be put in there , everything is perfectly believable . The dialog is well-written . There wasn't a lot I didn't like about this film , apart from the few tell-tale signs of Buscemi's inexperience in the director chair ( long takes for no apparent reason , one or two acting performances that are either under - or overdoing it , the occasional odd camera angle ) , but I can see why many probably won't like it . It's not a fast film , it's not that fun , and the ending doesn't really resolve anything . Everyone is still caught in their respective situations , none of which are satisfactory . No major revelation is made by the end of the film . In the end , Buscemi just makes his point . . . that the life of an alcoholic is an empty one . Nothing else . Don't rent this to laugh or learn a useful lesson . Rent this to get insight into the day-to-day life of alcoholics and their environment . I recommend this to fans of Steve Buscemi and people who enjoy films that just indulge in study of a certain group of people . Not for those with low attention spans .
450728	2093818	362583	8.0	Silly , fast-paced fun . . . if unevenly difficult , and , well , we could have done without quite so much gross-out comedy	One day , as Jim , the earth-worm , was crawling around , he found himself chased by a crow . . . he was fortunate enough to escape to safety , but what made this particular day stand out was the fact that right after that event had played out , a super-suit fell from the sky , and landed right on Jim . . . transforming him into Earthworm Jim , the superhero that we know today . The game starts with you going out to find Princess What's-Her-Name , who's been kidnapped by her hideously ugly twin-sister , the appropriately named Queen-Slug-for-a-Butt , who employs Psy-Crow , and various other evil creatures , in trying to get their hands at the suit , since it will make the Queen beautiful . The controls are simple and easy to learn , letting you fire the gun in basically any direction . The graphics are good , and still hold up nicely . The humor is silly and the gags are plentiful . . . and almost all of it works really well . Personally , I could have done without quite so much gross-out comedy . . . but maybe the fans of the character like that , I really don't know ( I've only played the first two games , I haven't seen the show that came later ) . The level design is pretty cool . . . the places you get to visit are imaginative and varied , and the challenges are good , if they don't always fit how far into the game they appear . The genre is action-adventure , with you alternating between blasting enemies with the red gun that goes with the suit ( or whipping them with Jim's worm-part ) and solving puzzles . You work your way through about twenty levels , to the almost impossibly and frustratingly hard last level . You get to play around with a few vehicles during the course of the levels , and some of the levels consist of racing Psy-Crow through increasingly thick asteroid fields , on a small one-person jet . Apart from the standard machine-gun blast , you can also pick up ammo for a few other weapons ; two , I believe , one , a blast of plasma , that does massive damage to anything in its path , and the other being seeking missiles . The sound is excellent , with both the music and the sound effects also adding to the hilarity . As you fly through the aforementioned asteroid fields , you are accompanied by a number of instruments ( which are unrelated to each other ) playing a merry tune . . . occasionally interrupted by a dog barking , a Jew's-harp or the sound of a farm animal . This is a game that takes you to Heck ( as it is known in this game ) and back . . . and on your trip down there , you'll encounter lawyers that attack you with case-files , and , when hit by your weapons , retort " I'll sue ! " The entire thing has that silly and goofy tone throughout . If that is how you like your games , then this is a must-have . With an entirely linear level design and a lack of high-scores ( or even anything to collect that gives points ; everything that you can pick up is extra lives , more health and more ammo for the weapons ) , the replay value really lies only in selecting a higher difficulty to complete the game at . The main levels are platform , with a dynamic camera which is mostly locked on Jim . Fast-paced , hopping , floating ( since Jim is , in fact , a worm , he can use his head as a propeller to keep himself afloat , though he can't stay in the air for very long , and will continually drop downwards , slowly ) and fighting fun . The game is exciting and addicting , and the boss fights and occasional unique level keep things interesting . Made by David Perry , who later went on to be the lead designer on Enter the Matrix , the simple controls and interface let you do quite a lot of fun feats . The sequel went on to add more weapons and a feature or two more , but only featured half as many levels , several of which weren't different from each other . I personally prefer this game , and one has to admire the fact that this was apparently what started the show , instead of the other way around . It certainly isn't hard to tell why this begot more games , and a television show . I haven't heard Castellaneta's Jim , so I can't say how good Douglas TenNapel ( the character creator who does the voice here ) , is comparatively , but whilst Dan ( no , I'm not putting myself through spelling out his last name again ) is known for his comic voices , on The Simpsons , Douglas does quite good , with a wacky , spaced Jim . Though I haven't tried the original version , I would advise anyone who intends to play this game , expecting to like it , to get the Special Edition , as it adds several things ( which you can read about in Alternate Versions ) , and improves on what is there . I would guess that children are the main audience that is aimed for , here , though basically anyone can play this game . It does take good reflexes and a bit of patience , however . You are given a level selector , though you cannot choose to start in a level that you haven't reached by playing through the previous ones , first . You start out with only a few lives , based on the difficulty . . . and though most levels have a few continue-points , which , if reached , allow you to start from there , instead of starting over on the level . But , if you run out of extra lives and Jim passes on , you will be sent to the " continue " screen . . . and you'll have to start the level all over , not necessarily knowing how to pass the part that cost you your level progress . That , and the gross parts of the comedy is pretty much the only problem I have with the game . If you plan on purchasing and playing this game , know that it can be very difficult . But through that , it's usually fun , always silly and makes for great escapism . I recommend this to any fan of the character , as well as anyone who enjoys silly , goofy fun . Cartoony , creative and colorful . . . and a great game for all ages .
450787	2093818	94625	8.0	Stunning	I read the comic book series a handful of years ago . . . I had read some other Manga prior to that , but this was the first that really grabbed me , and I made sure I read every single one of the chapters . I found out about this not terribly long after , and was excited to find out about both if Ôtomo was as skillful a director as a graphic novelist , and how the heck he was going to make a two-hour film out of 20 100-something ( please feel free to correct me if my memory is off on this ) page intense Animé releases . He did a darn good job . Some story elements are altered , and others , as well as characters , entirely eliminated , but without doing so , this would have been considerably longer . The fast pace is retained , and as far as I can tell , the meat of the source material comes through . The plot is engaging and well-told . The score is . . . interesting . The acting is great , with a few exceptions . I watched this with English voices , I don't know about the Japanese ones . The animation is a visual extravaganza ( in the nicest possible meaning ) , breathtaking , the lighting , the effects , all of it . The artists have an awful lot to be proud of here . The action is awesome , and the designs incredible . A solid chunk of what was really , really cool in the original work is here , and it is astounding . There are some rather bizarre , as well as many quite disturbing and grotesque sights and sounds in this , and those unsettled by such should almost definitely steer clear . There isn't a lot of language , but it tends to be strong . There is graphic violence and gore throughout the entire feature . There is a little nudity . It's all written out in the Parents Guide for those who want specifics . I recommend this to fans of Katsuhiro and the novel of the same title , as well as the overall style ( which this has in spades ) .
450430	2093818	73482	8.0	Pure hilarity in one of the most well-rounded and thoroughly thought out in the series	I must admit that this film has a special place in my heart . . . not quite as big as the one my fiancée holds , but it's still in there . It's the first Olsen Gang film I ever saw , and owned , and thusly , the one I've seen the most . Years before I saw their other efforts , I had watched this more times than I suppose I should admit . This is a unique entry , in many ways . It starts ( though at Mallorca , like the last one ) and ends very differently than any of the others . An interesting thing is that with the last film , the two had written these characters into a corner . . . the former movie ended the series perfectly , with the gang reaching their dream : Mallorca , as millionaires . But the audience requires more of the great series . How to solve this conundrum ? Where Bahs and Balling could have written a cop-out explanation , as lesser writers surely would have , they simply properly explain the return by showing how these people are affected by their new way of life . After an incident ( that I refuse to describe , as its simplicity and pure genius would not translate properly through my words . It needs to be seen ) , they find themselves back in this country . While that isn't a choice they themselves made , we still find that they are much happier here . . . in spite of still needing money , of being mediocre citizens , of suffering under the same shortcomings as they did before . Yes . East West , home is best . Be careful what you wish for . Clichés . But aren't clichés ( often ) just truths that we find we've heard one too many times ( and one does tire more easily of hearing something that is an annoying truth to have to admit to ) ? So , with that , we're back . . . Egon's got a plan , he's released from jail and he seeks out Benny and Kjeld , trying to get their backup for his latest genius and well-devised scheme . That leads to what might just be the most excellent scene featuring Yvonne in the entire series . . . and that's all I'll say of the plot . The plot is brilliant . The way it develops is magnificent . Pacing is as good as it comes . Despite having seen this countless times before and knowing basically everything that would happen , I wasn't bored for a second . The acting is top-notch , as always . Bøffen returns , still messing up the gang's plans . This time , Ove Verner Hansen truly gets to show off his great facial acting . Pouel Kern jumps on , as well , in a very small but incredibly funny role . Furthermore , Paul Hagen and Helge Kjærluff-Schmidt ( his only role in any of the Olsen Gang films , and it's tailor-made to suit him ) join in , as two preposterously old-fashioned high-ranking train workers ( doing a nice job of making fun of the Danish railways , which are featured quite prominently in this film ( hence the title ) ; that ( the Danish train system ) , by the way , is also such a definite Danish thing that it's no wonder they basically built this film up around it ) , and managing to reference a well-known song by Benny Andersen several times in their dialog . The humor is always brilliant , mostly sophisticated and at times downright sublime . The police are thoroughly made fun of yet again ( as is the general " Danish-ness " ) . The human touch remains , still spreading smiles and laughs . This may just be the most hilarious of all the films in the series , and the one that features the most laugh-out-loud moments . You'll laugh upon hearing Kjeld announce what he'd rather be doing than live in Spain . The laughter will become hysterical upon seeing his idea for making money . If you're not already crying with laughter by the time he misquotes the Three Musketeers , you'll start . This may also contain the most of Benny's silly laughter , in any one of the films . One of the best in a great series . Humorous , well-written and highly memorable . I recommend it to any fan of the franchise as well as any fan of comedy and Danish humor in general . I would say , though , that having watched the previous entries is a must .
449772	2093818	82842	8.0	Excellent ending to a grandiose series	The last half of the two-part ending . The definite ending ( as it should have been , and would have been , were it not for the ' 98 version ) to the series . We get closure and the finale delivers . Most certainly . Dramaturgically speaking , this goes all the way . We experience the biggest , most dramatic plot developments . This picks up exactly where the previous one left off . As to not spoil the highly entertaining end of that film , I won't go into too much detail about that . The situation is the same ; Egon still doesn't want to go back to prison , and Kjeld and Yvonne's celebration nears the date . The Gang is still chasing the suitcase , and their chase takes them into a hotel where the randy old Kai Løvring works , to Carlsberg breweries ( finally displaying the Latin quote , which has inspired so many parody ones throughout the series , probably because this is the last ) and even to Paris ( where Bahs and Balling wrote most of these films , again , possibly chosen because this was to be the last film ) , all of which including funny situations and jokes . The " morally light " nature of Paris is not only joked around a lot , it's a plot point . There are clever references aplenty , such as in the scene involving the KBG ( " No , not KGB , KBG ! " ) , Københavnske Body Guards ( Bodyguards of Copenhagen ) , with the nervous and slightly neurotic Claus Ryskjær at the helm . Yvonne also participates more actively this time , as always , helping in her own peculiar way , never following what's actually going on . Paris is the setting for some very funny scenes , one involving Maxim's . Dick Kaysø makes an appearance in a small role as a slightly tightly wound crane worker proud of his work . Poul Reichhardt has a very funny role , in which Benny shows his immense humanity . The humor is all sophisticated , much of it is hilarious , and it always hits the mark . We can follow the reasonings , understand the conclusions . The Danish sayings that are changed around are also undeniably side-splitting ( such as the very last phrase uttered by Holm , the policeman ) . The ending so perfectly finishes off the series . It's worth it for any fan , any real fan of the franchise . I recommend this very highly to any fan of Olsen Banden as well as Danish comedy . Watch the first 11 , then watch both parts of this in reasonably quick succession . You won't regret it .
450410	2093818	75148	8.0	One of Stallone's best films	Let me start this review of by making one thing absolutely clear ; I hate boxing . I don't even consider it a sport . I consider it legalized violence , that people pay money to see , knowing that each blow to the head costs countless braincells . So , there is no way I would ever like a boxing movie . But Rocky isn't a boxing movie . It's not about boxing ; it's about determination , will-power , and doing what you can to realize your dream . That's why I think Rocky is a great movie ; it has something that everyone can relate to . Many people who watch this movie don't know the first thing about boxing , nor do they care about it ( myself included ) ; but everybody has a dream , something that they want to accomplish , something great they want to achieve at some point in their life . And that's why it's going to appeal to so many different people ; everyone can relate to the theme : wanting to realize a dream . The plot is good , it moves along at a slow , steady pace , so you will need to be fairly patient with this film . Don't worry , the waiting pays off in the end . That I can promise you . The acting is pretty good , by pretty much everyone in the film , even Stallone , who I'm normally not at all impressed by . The characters are well-written , credible and likable ( the ones we're supposed to like , at least ) . The story and theme is something that really sparks some interesting thought , especially since this was based on something that really happened . It's definitely one of Stallone's best films . I recommend it to fans of Stallone , and people who the subject appeals to ( which should be many , many people ) who has the patience to sit through a somewhat slow-moving two-hour movie ( which narrows it down a little ) .
450425	2093818	79662	8.0	Some minor writing flaws , but overall a great entry	It's around this point that the budget ( if not the actual number , then the effort put into making the relatively high amount shine through ) and the stakes were raised . The vaults of the ninth , the Copenhagen City Hall Clock in the tenth . . . and then this one . The gang go to Bruxelles , and there's no doubt that at least much of it was shot on location . They also hijack a tank . The first of those two expenses begets some hilarious scenes . The plot is quite good , even if the main thing at stake is basically the same as it was last time . . . Denmark's fate . Børge returns , though he's hardly in the film at all . Fie's pregnant , and some attention is placed upon the fact that Kjeld will be a grandfather , though one is left wondering what happened to the first child of the young couple ( then again , this is the series of the disappearing kids . . . just watch the transition from the first film to the second ) . The pacing is quite intense . . . not a moment is wasted , though I don't think I would say that it goes too quickly . Arthur Jensen portrays the meter maid ( Parkeringsvagt ) that he did in the ninth , in a very brief but irresistibly funny scene . Solveig Sundborg appears for the last time in one of these films . Interestingly enough , she had very small roles in exactly seven of these films . . . which makes up half of the entire series ( if one counts the ' 98 reunion film , which , I suppose , one should , as painful for us fans as that can be ) . Edward Fleming shows up again , in a smaller role , though he does have one gag . Bøffen is hardly in the film at all , though his scene is fairly funny ( though his death trap isn't as creative as some of the others seen in the series ) . As a fun piece of trivia , his character seems to dress slightly differently in each film . . . new hat , different pieces of footwear and such . . . but he always wears a blue and white striped shirt with a black leather vest over . Peter Steen has his final role in this film , and with more luck and less of a pitiful overplayed performance than that seen in the three other films ( the first three , incidentally ) that he appeared in . It's amusing to see Bjørn Watt-Boolsen - in the role of Bang-Johansen - criticizing Holm Hansens big mouth . . . the very character he played twice , just a few films back . As my father pointed out while we watched , this seems to have more coups than any of the other entries . The opening scene contains what for my money is the single coolest break-in ever committed to film , at the very least for this franchise . The humor is still going strong , in spite of this not being as funny as the former film . . . the running gag about the police force's view on reporters , the Minister's wife who has a mania to turn out her rooms and the joke pointing out the solemnity of the profession of being a guard all spring to mind . There is poked some fun at the Danes ' ( and perhaps that of many human beings , in general ? ) love of good food and beers . The police is parodied , for the umpteenth time . Not much else to say . . . it's clear that the series is reaching its end at this point , though there is still some creativity left in Bahs and Balling . An entertaining film in the series , and worth watching for at least a few great sequences . I recommend it to any fan of Olsen-Banden and / or Danish comedy in general . Having seen as many of the other films as possible first is a must .
450049	2093818	168453	8.0	Great collection of masterful parodies	This is a collection of videos that should be experienced by any fan of Weird Al Yankovic . It has stuff dating back to 1983 , and as recent as 1996 , and in addition to twenty videos , it also has the ( albeit sans actual credits , apparently due to legal issues ) opening credit sequence of Spy Hard , for which he did the theme ( and he performs during said sequence ) . With a running time of one hour and fifteen minutes , this has a good amount of videos . The technical qualities are top-notch , both sound and image are crisp , and the menu layout and interface are well-done . Al is an expert at spoofing . . . movies and commercials are amongst his source materials , but he really shines when he does parodies of songs , bands , music videos and song styles . You'll never look at Madonna the same again after watching Like a Surgeon . Michael Jackson will never seem quite the same after Al's portrayal in Fat . And how about UHF , the theme of the movie , the video of which he manages to include a dozen or so different bands and / or singers ? The utterly random imagery found in Dare to be Stupid should garner a reaction from even the most humorless of individuals . His material is silly , goofy , clever , bizarre and just plain funny . He seldom stoops to sexual comedy , he hardly swears at all ( and never just to cuss ) , and save for the occasional violent imagery and themes ( which really aren't that bad ) , his stuff can be enjoyed by almost anyone who finds parody entertaining . His material also shows serious research and intelligence going into writing his songs . . . quite often , he gets to understand a time , a subculture or a people before he makes a funny song out of them . Granted , not all of the gags work , at times , the effects could be better and some of the videos are now dated ( but Jurassic Park is still funny , and so are the others ) , and his more recent efforts aren't all good ( I'm looking at you , Gump . . . although he has since proved to still have the knack for this stuff , with , for example , White and Nerdy ) . . . but the vast majority is just golden . Nod at the truths found in I Lost on Jeopardy . Experience the bitterness of One More Minute , the anti-Christmas quality of Christmas at Ground Zero , clearly thought up by a man who probably ( being Jewish ) never got to celebrate the holiday , even though it's all around . But most of all , enjoy . I recommend this to any fan of Weird Al Yankovic and similar , whether or not they've seen any or all of the videos before .
450788	2093818	277933	8.0	Set a standard that I've yet to see surpassed	Among the multiple noteworthy things in this is how thoroughly and well-achieved the Manga / Animé aspect of it is . Everything in this is defined by that . The style is just plain cool . There are some bugs / glitches , but no show-stoppers . . . most of them are limited to something that is not entirely aligned , and they aren't that plentiful . This starts off with brief training which goes at your pace , that teaches you just about every function in this ( the last couple are covered right after ) , and you can return to it at any time . This doesn't let you change which keys you use ( well , not from the menu ) . On the other hand , there really aren't that many to remember , and it's set up with the popular WASD configuration ( besides , if you ever have trouble remembering what does this or that , learning it is a press of a key , and a click with the mouse , away ) . Oni is third-person adventure and action , and the latter is an awful lot of fun ( which is not at all to say that the former isn't , if it isn't as advanced or as dominant in this as elsewhere ) . You can shoot as well as fight , and they are both extremely well-integrated ( and this is the best game featuring the twain alongside each other that I know ) , though there is perhaps more use for the latter . . . that doesn't mean that there hasn't been put strong focus on the weapons as well . The different kinds are . . . very much so . They're almost always unique , and fit in with the rest of this remarkably well . You can never carry more than one , and only a couple , literally , of ammo types are used for them . The martial arts . . . astounding , and entertaining , not to mention awesome . The system behind is intuitive and you get into it basically immediately . There is a nice wide array of moves , and they're simple enough to activate . . . and that is also true of your enemies , part of why battling them is not a matter of phoning it in . The other reason ? The AI . It's of marvelous quality , with quite few exceptions . The boss matches are excellent , and no two of them are too alike . While there are three difficulty settings , even on the lowest this is challenging , and some may not be able to complete it , and this can be a source of frustration . This has a great sense of humor , and whenever ( not so often that this loses it serious tone ) it goes for making you laugh , it does so , no joke or gag is forced or tries arduously . This saves at certain points , rather than allowing you to do so anytime . . . these are usually placed well , and not overly far apart ( obviously it can still prove to be annoying ) . Dialog tends to be very well-written , and equally well-delivered . Taunts , at least those of the foes . . . not always . They can be silly . Voice acting is in the favorable end of the spectrum . Sound on the whole is commendable . The music is divided into groups , the instrumental score for the emotional impact , and the techno for whenever the situation calls for something more sweet . . . and no , by that I do not mean love songs , or any tune revolving around lollipops , rainbows or bright colors . Story is interesting , and develops well , and there isn't any of it that is downright poor . The cyberpunk of it is good . It's told well , and with a continuous nod to the comic book nature of the Japanese type . There is an opening and an ending cut-scene , done in 2D cartoon ( instead of the 3D of the rest ) , of course in the manner of films of the sort . In-game cinematics are in-engine , well-scripted ( and major props to whoever programmed the cameras ) . Levels are fairly vast , and built well , however , they largely seem strikingly " empty " as far as objects in them go , interior and exterior . Design is a considerable plus in this . Every gun , attack , opponent , all things in this , well-done all-round . Futuristic , dystopian and threatening . This doesn't have multi-player . . . whether that's bad or not is subjective , but it's pretty clear that the efforts were fully directed towards single-player , and it pays off , big time . There could be more re-playability . . . no scores or ranking , not anything but the aforementioned option of choosing between Easy , Normal or Hard . Animation is varied , and it's attractive , as well . Visuals in general are well-done in this . That brings me to the graphics . . . they're magnificent . Sure , outdone by later releases , when isn't that case ? The game-play marries distinct forms of engaging excitement , firearms and meleé with such expertise that you'd otherwise have to watch movies for . Stealth is possible , and can turn out to be worthwhile . Strategy is a must . Missions are somewhat imaginative , not reinventing the genre , nor utilizing or relying upon the stand-bys of it until creativity is a mere memory . You'll infiltrate ( not the spy way ) bases , give chase , defend , sabotage , and all along undermine the plans of those you are up against . The rating on this is open . . . something that's welcome and they manage to not downplay it , it's effective and masterfully done all the same ( OK , granted , the first of those has a bit to do with the second ) . Almost anyone , regardless of age , could really play this thing . Sexuality is not an issue , there isn't any . All it amounts to is the clothing , and save for a single , nudity-free drawing , it's all sober . No language that I could tell herein . Violence is PG , PG-13 , not a drop of blood or any gore whatsoever . There is disturbing stuff , and don't get me wrong , children should perhaps stay away from this , unless they possess skin of inordinate thickness . For anyone wondering , as far as I know , this is only available for the PC . If you are at all up for this kind of thing , you'd have a tough time of finding any that are better than this . I recommend this warmly to every single fan of the Asian form of expression that I have already mentioned and / or VG's .
449878	2093818	119008	8.0	Great gangster / crime drama	When I heard about the main actors in this film , I was already sure that it had to be good ; with names like Al Pacino and Michael Madsen , you can't go totally wrong . Johnny Depp is also pretty good , in some films , this definitely being one of them . I have to admit , not having seen too many good gangster films , I was very excited to see this , considering the great names in the cast , and the promising commercials I saw for it . It was really a great movie ; the whole atmosphere of the gangster world , organized crime , was perfectly captured in the movie . The " wiseguys " acted , talked and moved like gangsters . The plot is very interesting and captivating , and it moves along at a great pace , considering the length of the movie . It keeps your interest for the duration of the film , as it develops almost constantly . The actors all do terrific jobs , especially the three main actors . The characters are well-written and their actions are entirely credible . The cinematography is pretty good , especially when depicting violence , as it really has the effect on you that the director obviously wanted it to . All in all , a great movie about the mob and the whole environment , but it could have been slightly better . You know too little of the gangsters ' intentions and motivations , which makes it too difficult to relate to anyone else than Johnny Depp's character , and his wife's character . I recommend this to anyone who's interested in the environment of the world of organized crime , who likes dramas . I also recommend it to any fans of Depp , Pacino or Madsen .
451018	2093818	290334	9.0	The war has begun	I base this on the 2-Disc release . It has started , and it simply rocks . This whole thing builds on almost all of what the first set up and did , in so many ways , and in fact goes places only a follow-up could . Now that the world and the universe have been established , they could afford to do interesting stuff with what they had , and this the romance is just part of it . The new is also impeccable . . . the villain , the addition of Nightcrawler , so much is brought to the table with this , food for thought , complexity , dense , more than meets the eye . This is bigger than its predecessor , and without becoming pure fluff in the process . The action is grander , without being the main focus . The themes are the same , with a couple of different explorations of them this time around . The attention to detail is still amazing . The plot is well-done , nice script , very intriguing , and the pacing is spot-on , never standing still and not overwhelming , either . The nods to the comics are marvelous . The humor is well-done and fitting . The dialog is mostly good and well-delivered . The effects are incredible , and better than before . There are utterly stunning visuals in this . The fights are memorable and awesome . The ending of X-Men pays off majorly in this . This is quite dramatic . The orchestral score is fantastic . The powers are used well , such as the morphing ( in this as well as the entry before it ) , and they look excellent . Production design is spectacular . The costumes , the tone in general remains true to the realistic approach . Cummings is well-cast , as well as Cox and Hu . The acting is , with few exceptions , invariably magnificent . There are strong women role models in this one , too . The problem of X1 has not been solved in this , in fact , if anything , it's made worse . There is an even greater amount of characters , and far from everyone gets to be developed in this . It does tend to work and there are fairly solid arcs in this . The abilities yet again have to be written around or out of the way entirely . These don't cost it a lot of points overall , I would say . There is relatively mild and infrequent language in this , and the sensuality is somewhat present , not necessarily strong . The DVD holds extras , including featurettes , interviews , behind-the-scenes stuff , extended / deleted scenes , plenty of galleries and two commentary tracks , one of Bryan Singer , and one of various crew-members , both well worth listening to . I recommend this to fans of the graphic novels , just watch the movie series from the 2000 film , and know that these translations , interpretations , not direct adaptations with everything accurate to the books . Those into science fiction ought to enjoy it , as well . And proof that sequels can match , and , arguably , surpass , the original , is always something to take note of .
449969	2093818	433390	9.0	Near-perfect execution	As is more often than not true for my reviews of VGs , this is based on the PC version . This title is generally met with positive response . That is well-deserved . In almost every way , this is the greatest since the first , and in many , it's even better . This is incredibly smooth , every aspect of it , it's unbelievable how much effort was put into it , and how well and clearly it all has paid off . This is probably the best of the whole series . The freedom is quite simply extreme . If you think you can do it , it makes sense to do in the context of what your goals are , and you have or can obtain the means . . . you are enormously likely to be able to . This allows you to be creative with your main limitation being your own imagination . You can spend literally countless hours trying out and finding the just about infinite different methods of successfully taking out your targets , with varying degrees of secrecy . Unprecedented , at least for these . Talk about your re-playability value . Things that occurred in the others are considerably more available here . They manage to keep them from becoming flat and dull . I'd say it's because they have multiple applications , and are , honestly , darned fun to work with . Examples , you ask ? How about the possibility of making your hit look like an accident ? They do happen , you know . Barbecues malfunction . Heavy objects drop at inopportune times , for those that are under them as they do . Less attention can help a professional killer . That brings me to the notoriety . If you get seen or make yourself too noticeable . . . mass murderers tend to be . . . then you will , in fact , be tracked down . Your picture might get in the paper . Civilians can recognize you . That's gonna make a mess of your next assignment . Either you plan and sneak , eliminate them spot-on , without anyone knowing you were there , or you spend a hefty chunk of your reward . . . which also depends on your rating , the stealthier , the more . . . buying the trouble away . Furthermore , you always get to carry a tactical explosive with you . Sabotage or a crude . . . but deliciously effective , and usually untraceable . . . instrument to render members of the opposition , and that includes the ones you're specifically hired to remove , deceased . The choice is yours . You now always have a syringe of poison , and one that will sedate , and mostly two uses of each . They can taint foods , or you can go for the direct approach . This combination is good , and the next step for that . In this are intricately detailed briefings , more so than the others in the franchise , except for perhaps Codename : 47 , as well . This makes hiding easier , both for yourself and for bodies . Someone pointed out that this does get a tad obvious . . . with containers big enough to hold a corpse found in a bunch of areas . The closets for the clone himself are somewhat inconspicuous . There are negatives in this . . . they're minuscule and seldom impact the entertainment , but not entirely nonexistent . The training bit has been brought up before , too . While it does , indeed , introduce a lot of what you can do in this , leaving little of it unrevealed , it fails in setting the tone , by not only suggesting you mow down the majority of all you meet , but largely forcing you to do so . Unwise . From then on out , every mission does let you attain the coveted SA , or Silent Assassin , if you do it right . The several marks in all of them , among other things , help ensure that this offers plenty of challenge , and to all , on account of the four difficulty settings , that are rather well defined , and you get to read precisely what each has and hasn't got , prior to any second of trying it . This has a profile system . . . for every completion , you can store your progress , although you aren't required to , if , for example , you weren't happy with how well you did . Note that you can't load what you've saved if you exit , if you stop playing , you have to start that one , over . The weapons of this are nice and cool , and you have a couple that you can upgrade . . . the iconic Silverballers , the nifty Spas 12 , an M4 , a Heckler & Koch MP5 and the infamous Walther 2000 . We're talking , silencers , alternate ammo , accuracy , speed to name a few . The money for those would be another reason to go for " clean " play-throughs . You can now purchase " intel " , hints . The level design is solid . The map leaves little , if anything , to be desired , as with most else in this . The interface is magnificent . The camera is now " loose " , with 360 degrees of freedom . And without losing the solid control of 47 . You can , as the developers put it , stage the attacks , view it from the angle you want as you go into action . The cinematic style of this is excellent . The cut-scenes are amazing , and , seemingly , in spite of the LOD on them , invariably in-engine . They're part of the source of pure , unadulterated awesomeness of this . The plot is intriguing and well-told , with a climactic and satisfying twist . The graphics are immense and masterfully done . This tops as far as the realistic movement goes , and the rag-doll physics . This supports a huge group of characters at an occasion , and the NPCs always have their own life . You can watch it play out if you don't affect them . The AI is astounding . The music . . . wow . I wouldn't rule out that it's more enticing and fitting than in the other three . Jesper Kyd outdoes himself . With one exception , this takes place in the US . . . and nowhere else . That doesn't have to preclude it from having interesting and diverse locations , and it doesn't . There are some stereotypes in this , along with language , particularly in aforementioned intro , that can get harsh , and strong , at times pervasive , sexuality , albeit no nudity . I recommend this to any fan of the others , and / or open games .
450255	2093818	409459	9.0	Grand	I was completely hooked from the first page . Obviously , this , as is the cardinal rule with adaptations , particularly from one medium to the other , can never completely match what the source was . With that out of the way . . . this gets a remarkable amount of it right . Dr . Manhattan ? Couldn't have been much closer . The Comedian ? Just about spot-on . Rorschach ? Basically so accurate that you need rather sensitive measuring equipment to find anything actually wrong with him here ( Jackie Earle Haley . . . wow ) . At its best , this hits the mark with such a bullseye that it really barely gets better at all . This gets ( some ) crucial content and meaning from the books , too . In spite of a running time of about two and a half hours , it didn't lose me , in spite of knowing what was coming . This can boast astounding intensity , when it goes for such , and doesn't overwhelm by going too fast , either . . . the pace is impeccable . The plot is magnificent , with a couple of big changes made ( and as expected , a lot cut out , there was no way to put that mass of material into a feature film length ) . The writing is great , the choosing and execution are masterful a large part of the way . Certain differences could be argued as being necessary to make this work , in this format . I'm not sure they are all good . There are clear opinions interjected . The acting is , with few exceptions ( Akerman being a notable one of them ) , marvelous . The casting is quite nicely done . The action , the fight scenes , excellent , although it can perhaps be called unfitting to add more to them , and they sure did . . . but my gosh , it sure is amazing and entertaining to watch . The comics were mainly drama . The CGI is incredible . The stylization and visuals are immensely gorgeous and effective . This does elicit emotional responses , if maybe not as many as desired . The music is full of fantastic and interesting picks . The score is composed well . If one is familiar with the original , given that it is not entirely what Alan wrote ( though it tries to be faithful , and often succeeds ) , you'll hopefully either enjoy this , or avoid it , realizing that you might not . If , however , you are not aware of it , this may confuse and not fully make sense to you ( things range all the way from being over - to being under-explained ) . They made this bloodier / nastier . This has strong ( and continuous ) violence and harsh language ( albeit fairly infrequent ) , and plenty of nudity / sexuality ( at points , less covered than what viewers might be expecting ) , of varying tastefulness . I recommend this to any fan of the graphic novel , the concept , the dark tone and / or Moore .
450819	2093818	108906	9.0	I'm . . . I'm speechless	This turned out to be a truly haunting , hypnotic and gripping tale . . . how could it have eluded me for so long ? Yes , I know , I said in the one line summary that I'm speechless . . . and that is my initial reaction . . . but that would make this review awfully short , wouldn't it ? I remember seeing part of this as a kid . . . it terrified me . Now , I'm not known to have a photographic memory . If a thing doesn't make an impression on me , it can vanish from my recollection within a very short space of time . Just like that . Without a trace . That , by the way , is the name of a rather entertaining TV series . But I digress . As I re-watched this , specifically the last episode , I could recognize what I saw . Every shot , every line , it rang so clear to me , as had I watched it mere days before . . . and not over a decade . This was first aired on Danish television in 1994 , and I'm fairly certain that was when I saw a little of it . Twelve years ago . Comparatively , I saw several episodes of Kingdom Hospital , the Stephen King-authored Americanization / ripoff of this marvelous story when it aired here , about a few months ago , possibly half a year . . . and the only things I do remember are the scenes that were copied from this , which were much , much better in this version . The plot is exceptionally well-written and the way it develops is almost sublime . The pacing is near-perfect . Few times were I ever bored , almost too few to even bother mentioning , and as the show approached its end , I found myself even more on the edge of my seat , even more caught up in the intensity , even more excited to see where it would all go . The suspense becomes nail-biting to an almost physically painful level , finally reaching an incredible climax . The writing is great . It deals with some strong ethical questions , and combining horror with soap-opera-ish drama works surprisingly well . It takes the occult terror down to a level we can relate to better , through the more usual problems . The acting is all flawless . With so many big names , most of them Danish ( unusual for Trier ) and Udo Kier , Lars ' old favorite casting choice , the characters are all carried perfectly . For so many characters , I found I was rarely ever confused as to who were doing what and why . The writing for these characters is great ; the chief surgeon with his disgusted , arrogant personality , a trait men of such powerful positions surely must develop . I don't remember when filmed entertainment last involved me like this . This film gripped me tight and would not let go . In fact , I can't say for sure that it has . The grip may not be gone yet . . . and may in fact remain intact until I've seen the entirety of the second series , if not past that , as well . Such a powerful presentation . . . the imagery , the sound , the impression it has left . . . unique in its combined simplicity and effectiveness . The cinematography is great . Using what seems to be hand-held camera the majority of the time , the film's look has a restless , unnerved quality to it . With some long takes that are somewhat reminiscent of Kubrick , the eery feel and thick atmosphere is established and kept throughout . There were a few single cases where the camera-work or lighting kept the viewer from being able to see exactly what was going on , but these were so rare and minor , they don't impact the overall experience . What does , however , achieve that , and what brings my rating down from a perfect 10 . . . is the humor . Amongst the disturbing , nearly traumatizing serious occurrences , we have these breaks containing typical Danish humor , a humor I don't care too much for and which just doesn't seem to fit . It takes some away from the seriousness , and near the end it just reaches an entirely ridiculous level . It felt as though I was watching an old Danish comedy ( eh , let's face it , back then , some decades back , they were all comedies ) . Any Dane or even someone who has a fair bit of knowledge regarding Danish film history will know what I mean , especially if they've seen this otherwise spell-binding mini-series , too . Sadly , that harms the overall quality of this otherwise fine product some , but it is still more than worth your time . I don't remember when 4 hours last passed by so quickly . . . except for time spent with my wonderful , beloved fiancée , of course , which passes even faster . I recommend this to any fan of Lars von Trier , the occult , horror and masterful film-making .
450473	2093818	88993	9.0	More gore than Night , less action than Dawn	By far the most claustrophobic of the trilogy ( and possible . . . of all time ? ) , this third and final film of George Romero's so-called Dead Trilogy takes us beyond the realization of the enemy which was Night of the Living Dead and fighting the losing battle which was Dawn of the Dead to evading and , more importantly , understanding our enemy . . . a step that should have been taken far earlier in the fight , since it may soon be too late . The most complex and satirical of the series ( and , believe me , that says a lot ) , this is seemingly the least popular of the three films . . . possibly due to the extreme gore ( especially near the end . . . yikes ) , the loathsome characters ( both preceding films had more people to root for ) or the idea that we need to understand our enemies ( and maybe not even fight them at all ) . This movie starts out with a vision so horrifying , it can only be a dream . Sure enough , the main character awakens . . . to a reality that is even worse . First , we met the enemy . . . then , the battle we knew we would eventually lose was fought . . . now , we face the consequences of a problem that wasn't met with the necessary response , an enemy that was underestimated from the beginning . Romero once again creates satire and forces us to face our own flawed humanity , our own shortcomings . Maybe that is a part of why the film is less liked , as well . The plot is great , and one must love and admire how Romero pits brains against braun . The pacing is the best of the series ( well , what I've seen of it , I can't claim that I've had the pleasure to watch the latest installment , Land of the Dead yet ) . The acting is top-notch , especially that of the character of Bub . Arguably , some of the other performances were less than astonishing , but these aren't exactly well-known , seasoned actors here . The special effects are nothing short of chilling and disgusting . Savini may actually have outdone his work on Dawn of the Dead in this film . . . and that is not something achieved without enormous effort . The final chapter of Romero's trilogy of the Dead is more than worth your time , just as the two other parts . I recommend this to fans of the genre , Romero and Savini . Be forewarned ; though it may not look like it at first glance , this has some of the most bone-chilling gore ( of the series . . . of films in general , take your pick ) , and any potential viewer should take into strong consideration if their nerves and stomachs are up for it . If you can watch this and you're into its kind . . . don't miss this for the world .
449931	2093818	103064	10.0	There's a reason this is so appreciated	Let it be said right away : There is at least one obvious issue with this . That doesn't have to include the fact that this is one of those sequels that are so much like the original that one could argue that it's partially a remake . What I'm referring to is that going by the first , it technically shouldn't exist . I am not aware of anyone who considers the predecessor of this to be the only film in this series ( I've experienced many who , with good cause , deny there to be a third movie . . . heck , I am one of them ) , but I could see why there could be . However , if you look past that ( and you ought to at least consider doing so , as this doesn't come off as one of those follow-ups released to cash in on an earlier success ) , you're in for an undeniably enjoyable and well-done cinematic experience . The plot is interesting and well-told . The pacing is solid . The acting is great from all , Patrick is an incredible addition , and neither Arnie nor Linda have forgotten how to portray their role . The action gets bigger , and still consists of fights , shootouts and car chases , all of which are marvelous and exciting , and never degenerates into stupidity . The guns are still impeccably well-chosen and handled . Really cool . The new concept or two herein are very smart and well-thought out . The science fiction remains well-done . This holds an appropriate amount and volume of self-irony over the title character ( though I did not mind the seriousness of the previous silver screen effort ) . While some of the dark tone is maintained , it is less violent and disturbing than the 1984 piece . There is also no nudity ( well , just about ) or sexuality in this . I have more points against this , meanwhile , they all give stuff away , and this will remain a spoiler-free review . And even with them , it's hard to argue with the quality of this , even if you prefer The Terminator to it ( and I do ) . I recommend this to any fan of sci-fi , intense scenes , James Cameron , the others who made this , and / or food for thought wrapped neatly in celluloid .
450685	2093818	83907	10.0	A worthy contender for ' greatest horror film ever '	I don't know why it took so long for me to watch this film . . . I think it's the fact that I've always been told that it's a gore-fest and not really anything else . I can tell you now ; I have been grossly misinformed . This is one of those films that everyone who's into the genre should see . If you as much as ' like ' horror , you should see this film . Look past the less-than-stellar acting , the dubious dialog and the thin character writing , and you will see one of the greatest horror films ever created . The plot is hardly worth mentioning . The pacing is top-notch , you're not bored for a second through the entire film . Not one second , throughout the whole film . Seriously . The acting is mostly unimpressive . The characters are daftly written , and so hard to tell apart due to vague personalities that I was never completely certain how many men or women there were , or who was who ( well , apart from Campbell as Ash , but his face is a pretty recognizable one ) . The dialog , as mentioned earlier , is quite dubious . Just about all characters ( including the demons / Evil Dead , in-between moans and ' join us ' ) get at least one really bad line . Delivery isn't exactly perfect , either . The effects , though some cheap and a few outdated ( but not noticeably so ; none of them looked fake or were easy to figure out ) are very good . The real strength in this film , however , is the buildup to the horror and the editing . The way " The Evil " , this unseen , abstract force of true evil is hinted at through the film . . . impossibly effective . The POV shots originating from said force are incredibly creepy . The editing is tight and excellent . The cinematography is by far some of the best I have seen in my entire life . A few shots were off , but there is no doubt that Raimi knows exactly where to put the camera or how to move it , even when he doesn't have the money to get a hold of expensive rigs . Now , as mentioned earlier , many have told me that this is a gore-fest . . . while everything I have put in my review up to this point still stands , let me make one thing clear ; there is plenty of gore in this film . For better or for worse . Plenty . Limbs are torn off , bodies are maimed and blood is dripping by the truckloads . However , even if you don't like gore , if you don't care for blood and violence , you should watch this film . . . if you are into horror and you can take the gore ( which is graphic and intense , make no mistake about that ) , you should definitely watch this film . One to watch for everyone who is into horror . I recommend this film to every horror fan who believes he can stand the violence and gore , and to everyone who is into both horror and gore . . . you've probably already seen this film , but if you haven't , go do so now . You won't regret it .
450402	2093818	120586	10.0	Poignant piece on hate	This movie has left me speechless . Now , to fully grasp how gargantuan ( yes , I like Kill Bill ; sue me ) this effect is , you must understand how fond I am of talking . I can talk for hours . You may find yourself listening to me and wondering if and when I ever stop to breathe . Sidenote , that happens almost seamlessly while I talk , a common habit that comes with an affinity for rap music . . . but I digress . Getting back on topic ( if I still have your attention ; I imagine many readers gave up on this review the moment they realized that I have enjoyed the work of Tarantino and the music genre of hip-hop ) . . . this movie affected me strongly and deeply . The credits rolled nearly an hour ago , as I'm writing this , and the movie has not left my mind one single time since ( to be fair , neither has my fiancée . . . but she never leaves my mind ) . Such an amazing film . The plot is magnificent , and the way it's told is an example of incredibly talented storytelling . The acting is all top-notch , not one single performance was disappointing . The characters are well-written , credible and well-developed . The cinematography ( done by Tony Kaye , the director , himself , quite impressive ) is just a touch unusual , with what I would call some very tight close-ups , though I suspect the picture of my borrowed copy of this film to have been customized towards a different type of screen than my TV is , since there were times where the camera cut it a little close , removing parts of text visible on-screen and much of the characters ' heads in close-ups . The pace is excellent ; not once during watching was I bored or drawn towards any other activity than watching . There is time to take in what you see , but the movie never moves slowly . As my father commented after it was done , you find yourself nailed to your seat . Alternative methods of crucifixion aside . . . The editing is great , with a very fitting use of speed and perspective , and an interesting use of flashbacks . The direction is nothing short of masterful . The very ending of the film is such a perfectly set-up and astoundingly executed ' last word ' on hate and the effects of it . The underplayed direction that makes this scene have its impact . . . I must admit , Kaye has made a fan of me , and I will be sure to watch any other effort he releases , theatrically and otherwise . The score of this film is beautiful . I don't think it is possible to watch this film and not be emotionally involved . It's not that it's terribly manipulative ( all films are somewhat manipulative ; few forms of art aren't , and some movies are truly art . In fact , in my humble opinion , most movies should be ) , it's that it's true . Refreshingly free of an ideology , an agenda . It simply presents the truth . Hate begets hate . Violence spawns violence . Fighting fire with fire merely increases the burn . This movie truly got to me . Do yourself a favor ; let it get to you , too . Watch this if you get the chance to , and if you can take the harsh truth of it ( and , lest we forget , the rather aggressive and at times fairly graphic violence that it features ) . I urge you . This should be seen by anyone who can take it .
450556	2093818	57012	10.0	Still laughing , long past the end credits . . .	Who'd have thought that Kubrick had such a great sense of humor ? I mean , in most of his films , there are snippets of humor , and Barry Lyndon has a definite irony , but I hadn't expected him to be able to direct such a hilarious and thoroughly entertaining comedy . I had known for a while that this was the highest rated Kubrick film here on IMDb , so naturally , I was excited to find out if it was really his best film . Even though I haven't seen Lolita , Spartacus , Eyes Wide Shut or his first few films ( the shorts he made before his feature ) , and even though I thoroughly enjoyed his other films , this very well may be his best film . Made in a period of time where the thought of nuclear war was a terrifying idea , that was believed to be a reasonable fear , the film takes this idea and turns it around , makes us laugh at it . The film was made during the Cold War , which must have taken quite a lot of guts on Kubrick's side . . . then again , he did start out , intending to make a thriller / suspense film about the subject , but ultimately realized that a comedy with a lighthearted look on the situation would be a better idea . So , he turned the idea of impending doom from nuclear holocaust into a black comedy . Personally , I think he did a damn good job of it . I haven't laughed that hard and for so long at any one time for quite a while . . . in fact , I might never have . The comedy isn't overplayed , in fact most of it is presented in a dead-pan , matter-of-fact-like type of way . . . what's even more hilarious is that the better part of it is completely accurate . No dumb stereotypes , no old clichés . . . just logic and simple , good old-fashioned observation . The plot is excellent , and very well-paced . In my opinion , Kubrick's most well-paced film . The plot takes off almost immediately and moves at a great pace throughout the film . The acting is flawless . Absolutely flawless . Not something completely unusual for a Kubrick film , but still . George C . Scott and Peter Sellers are amazing . Normally , I'm not too fond of Sellers , but here he was brilliant . The characters are well-written , diverse and interesting . The cinematography is great . Just like Kubrick's other films , this one has some very memorable scenes , one of which ( the bomb-riding sequence ) has been referenced and spoofed a huge number of times . . . possibly more times than any other sequence in Kubrick's films , which is quite impressive . The dialog is well-written , well-delivered and memorable . Plenty of quotable lines . I can't really say much more about the movie without ruining one or more of the innumerable great jokes . . . so I'll just suggest you see it . Seriously , if you enjoy Kubrick's sense of humor as seen limited in his other movies , you're going to enjoy this film . Maybe not as much as I did , but you'll most likely laugh . A lot . I recommend this to any fan of Kubrick , black comedies , Peter Sellers or just comedies with a dark basic theme to watch this . I can't praise it enough . See it , unless you are offended by the themes the film presents . You won't regret it . I know I didn't . Not by a long shot . Hilarious film with a provocative plot and basic idea .
450191	2093818	80684	10.0	The best of all six	Where the first was an introduction to this vast universe , this is a further adventure in it , and an expansion of it . New worlds , creatures and technologies . Like its predecessor , this has something for everyone , and this is a stronger film . . . perhaps the most so , of the entire series . Kershner is undoubtedly at least part of the reason . . . he worked to make the characters realistic and credible beyond what they were , and it pays off . The various relationships are more believable than in the others , and the developments are very natural . This offers an emotional connection to the material , for the viewer , in addition to all the entertaining aspects . The plot remains interesting throughout and it never stands still . The pacing is spot-on , there isn't a boring moment in the two hour running time . The effects are impeccable , and Lucas had the crew push themselves to the limit , and it shows . . . big time . The score is yet again fantastic , Williams adds to what he created for IV . The acting is good , and seldom poor . The tone gets darker , setting up a sequel . The episode before this was a solid story even if it would be the only in the franchise , and this is a perfect middle part . This has by far the greatest light-saber action in the Original Trilogy . This is exciting and masterful with dialog and tension of high quality . The DVD features a commentary track well worth a listen , with several speakers , including Irvin . I recommend this to fans of Star Wars ( regardless of what exactly you take that to mean ) , science fiction and movies .
450767	2093818	310793	10.0	Provocative and thought-provoking , though somewhat biased	I haven't seen any other feature film length documentaries of Michael Moore's , nor have I read any of his books . I mainly watched this because the subject interests me , and because I had seen one or two short documentaries by Moore , and I enjoyed his direct , provocative and uncompromising fashion of making documentaries . When I found this on DVD at a fair price , I bought it immediately , and watched it as soon as possible . It's a fair argument to claim that this documentary is somewhat biased and one-sided , since Moore ( apparently ) has a reputation for only showing his own opinion and stand on the subject , but he makes up for it by being very well-informed and only using facts to present his argument . I liked the way he presented the subject , by showing , for example , just how easy it is to get a gun , and how , despite not being terribly different from many other major countries , the U . S . has a far higher murder rate than most of its neighbors . The various clips that were edited in were obviously carefully selected , and mostly has exactly the effect on you , the viewer , that it's supposed to . The interviews are well-done , though arguably presenting a fairly stereotypical view on the pro-gun interviewees , while making the anti-gun interviewees seem intelligent , and having more sense , and better arguments for their opinions . Overall , the film is ironic , provocative and thought-provoking , but it's also at least a little biased . I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the subject , the subject being gun control and the right to bear arms ; despite your opinion on it . Excellent documentary , more than worth your time and attention .
450483	2093818	369702	10.0	Amazing	This may very well be the best of Amenábar's work to date . I've seen all he's completed thus far , as of and including Tesis . I've yet to truly dislike or find myself unable to see genuine value in what I've watched that he's helmed . They are all movies of questions , not answers , as he , himself , puts it . And they all deal with life and death , often among other philosophical subjects . This perhaps in a different way than the others . At its center is the following for us all to ponder : Is living a right , or an obligation ? No lectures , no dictating , nothing is claimed as fact , but rather stated , and it is up to the individual to decide where they stand . The deliberate , eased pacing , with some use of sudden , startling shifts in intensity that he has employed before is evident here , and it's a perfect fit . This is very well-directed and effective . It can be strong , but never tasteless . In his make-up , Bardem is almost unrecognizable , going by what I've gotten of a look at him outside of it , which , admittedly , is not much . The editing and cinematography are masterful . Not a single moment is off . The acting , as well as I can judge it , not yet speaking the language , is spot-on , throughout . Javier , especially , seems to lose himself entirely in the role , and comes off as believable . The characters are well-written and credible . There is a little humor , and it is good ( do note that among it is relatively dark jokes ) . As with the previous releases by the man I mentioned at the beginning of this review , this is not a mainstream , easy-to-take-in flick . If you are seeking entertainment ( I'm not passing judgment , I don't only go for this kind of piece ) , you will probably do better to go elsewhere . The DVD holds three deleted scenes that are well worth the time ( and they're also subbed , so that helps ) , and a behind-the-scenes featurette that I will write about on its specific page here on the site . I recommend this warmly and eagerly to any fan of true film , of drama and of the people involved in making this , Alejandro in particular .
450554	2093818	71315	10.0	A noir masterpiece , possibly even a timeless classic . . .	While I don't care too much for Roman Polanski's style of direction ( maybe I'll grow to like it eventually , maybe not ) , I can't deny that this is a truly great film . Jack Nicholson really shines through in his role , and his acting in this film perfectly fits the character . . . his shark smile , his voice , his tone . . . all of it , perfect . I always thought , when watching films with Nicholson , that he'd make a great lead in a noir film , so when I found this film and discovered that it was indeed noir , I naturally saw it as soon as possible . I found the film to have a slightly slower pace than what I would have preferred or expected , but apart from that minor detail , it was flawless . The plot is great , and thoroughly interesting and involving . The pacing , while not fast all the time , is more than acceptable . There are sequences that are really intense and exciting . The acting is great . . . like I said earlier , Nicholson shines through and really takes this character and makes him his own . The characters are well-written and credible . The special effects are well-done and still hold up pretty well . The dialog is very well-written and memorable . There are quite a few quotable lines , as well . The cinematography is good , and even when the plot doesn't move a lot , Polanski keeps our interest through interesting angles and sequences . I liked that there was often something subtle going on in the background , while we're focusing on what's directly in front of us . While Polanski certainly doesn't possess the attention to detail that Kubrick does , he manages to put a good bit of detail into many of the shots , and there is fairly little left to coincidence or chance , much like Kubrick . The film has a few twists that are quite good , and they come as surprises . . . I don't think I really saw them coming , and I doubt anyone would be able to . Of course , some might not find the twists to be that impressive , but the story stands on it's own nicely as well . This is a great movie , which should be seen by just about anyone who can take it ( it's more than just casually adult in nature , even though there's not that much violence or sex in it ) . I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys film noir , watching Jack Nicholson in perfect shape in a role that was tailor-made for him , a good mystery , Roman Polanski's direction and just a good movie with a more adult tone that many others .
449992	2093818	1060277	10.0	Excellent from start to finish	I haven't followed the hype-campaign for this , so I can't really say if it's good to watch this if you have done so or not . I was interested in this from when I first saw the teaser trailer . Yes , this does evoke images of . Yes , the entire film is presented as something that was taped on a camcorder . And yes , this camcorder does have rather impressive zooming capabilities , and a battery the durability of which is remarkable . But this is an awesome film . It's a thrill-ride , intense throughout , once it starts to be ( and I wasn't bored with what was going on before that ) . It is incredibly well-paced , it never gets to be overwhelming , but it never lets you relax all the way , either . For about an hour and a half , you will feel the sense of not really being safe . J . J . doesn't disappoint . The masterful story-telling , the marvelous concept ( which is a very interesting new angle on a very familiar type of movie / story . . . this is like The Blair Witch Project , only , you know , quality stuff ) , which was executed exceptionally well , the rich characters ( which are developed and introduced subtly and skillfully ) , the dialog ( it's " real " , clever / expertly written , or both ) . . . all the way , the traits of his productions and his talent are there ( here's hoping Lost doesn't suffer ) . The acting is flawless . I found the amount of exposure of the creature to be about perfect , I'm not sure I would have gone with neither more nor less . There's enough that you won't wonder what it looked like , and yet it's in such sparse amounts that it never loses its effectiveness , it never ceases to be scary to us . The way the film is presented is a reasonably simple idea , but the way it's used and what it does is great . I don't remember when I was last this into a movie , or had such a fun time at the cinema ( in fact , on that last one , this may be the first time for that ) . The film is perhaps not entirely without clichés , but they are quite rare , almost non-existent . It pulled the rug out from under me again and again , as J . J . has before shown a knack for being able to . The special effects are amazing , and never really feel like such . Watch this for the ride , for the well-told story within a monster flick told from an original perspective , and / or for , well , the J . J . Any fan of his may love this , if not necessarily as much as I did , and for anyone who isn't , well , this may very well have made a fan out of my dad . . . and he's usually into realistic and authentic films , more than " spectacle " ones . I recommend this to anyone who feels they would enjoy it . Keep working , J . J . , I'm definitely behind you .
450070	2093818	88323	10.0	The best fantasy movie ever made , and probably the only one I've ever liked	I really loved this movie , which is impressive since I usually can't stand fantasy / adventure movies . It affected me on a nostalgic level , as I had seen it once before , when I was about 7-8 years old , and seeing it again ( now 17 , soon to be 18 ) brought back a lot of memories . The movie is like it's made up of hundreds of kids ' imaginations . It brings you some of the most memorable and fantastic creatures ever seen on film . Of course the effects seem awfully dated , especially now , where practically every new movie has CGI effects ; but they're still good enough , and they were very good in their time . The plot is great , it evolves at a perfect pace , and keeps your interest from the very first second to the very last . I never took my eyes off the screen . The acting is also great , which is quite an achievement , considering the fact that a lot of the cast consists of child actors , but they all portray their respective characters well , and pull off believable performances . The characters are well-written , and , considering that they mainly consist of fantasy creatures , they're all perfectly credible . There isn't really anything in this masterpiece of fantasy / adventure that I would change in any way ; even the few things that are corny have their own charm . I recommend this to any kid , and any person of any age who enjoys fantasy / adventure . It's definitely worth watching .
450330	2093818	314331	10.0	British humor , love , and christmas . . . quite good actually	I have to say , I've never been too happy about British humor , I've always been more fond of the American humor . This movie has turned it around ; while not always being laugh-out-loud funny , it is persistently funny , throughout pretty much the entire thing . I can't say I was bored at any point in the movie ; even when it isn't funny , it isn't boring . And this is definitely the best movie I've ever seen about love . At the beginning , a lot of the characters are alone and lonely . At the end , most of them are with their love , having found the ' one and only ' . I enjoyed every aspect of this movie , Hugh Grant being his typical British charming self , Keira Knightley being her adorable sweet self , even Rowan Atkinson's small , yet funny character amused me . This is not only for couples , or people who have found true love . It is most likely enjoyable , at least a little , to everyone . Whether you like British humor , wonderful music , or romance , you won't be disappointed . This movie has all three , and plenty of each . This is for anybody who likes funny movies , romance , and isn't too easily offended .
