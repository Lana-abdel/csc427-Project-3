450502	2093818	116723	1.0	You have been found guilty on the charge of being a dreadful movie , and are hereby condemned to obscurity and widespread , justified hatred	If this is not heavily featured on every list of " what not to watch " , it should only be because those keeping that particular list are not aware of its existence , which , as long as that remains so , is the acceptable alternative . I'm not kidding you , this is a bad " movie " . Joseph Meeker returns from the dead , with various vague , undefined supernatural powers , the most employed of which would seem to be appearing in new , increasingly comical-looking and ridiculous ( and never scary or creepy . . . in general , when this goes for the latter of those , it winds up just being bizarre , and attempts at the former just don't work , period ) outfits and stereotypes / archetypes , and he is portrayed by David Keith ( whom I respect in . . . well , at least Daredevil ) , doing a more often than not terribly inconsistent ( which could also have to do with script ) and often over the top performance . A character or two have personalities so unbelievably irritating that they're painful to watch . The editing thinks it's considerably more clever than it really is ( and what on Earth was with the red tint for the flashbacks ? ) . Cinematography . . . oh , dear . Framing , coverage , effective use of angle ( that one could be attributed some to editing , too , perhaps ) , please , guys , stop me when I say something you've ever heard about the existence of . As far as the technical side goes , this is a pretty lousy excuse for something more worthwhile to put in the projector than unexposed film . But why stop there ? The plot is just poor . The basic idea's been done , and it's been done so much better than this ( The Crow would be one ) . The way it's told is gimmicky , and while there is some explanation behind the flashbacks , it still doesn't satisfy . Pacing is about non-existent . The lead is distinctly unlikeable , and there's more personality in a barn door , not to mention that those are also considerably less wooden . Kelly Perine and Thomas Ian Nicholas ? What in the name of all that is good and just ( pun intended ) are you doing in this ? Perine , you were already funny before this , on The Drew Carey Show , Nicholas , well , I haven't seen you in anything preceding American Pie , but if nothing else , you were funny later on , and in those productions , the amusement was intentional . Dialog is . . . the less said , the better . Language is unrestrained , and tends to be stupid . The violence is shoddily done , and they don't even seem to care to try to hide it ( hinting at it might have been the smarter strategy ) . Characters , don't get me started . Why spend so much energy on portraying unexciting , at times utterly illogical , events ? The more you think about this , the worse it gets . It's not even passable as a " bad horror flick " , or a B movie ( it may very well pass through the rest of the alphabet , and go further still ) , it couldn't scare you on the scariest day of your life if it had an electrified scaring machine . I recommend this only to people who want to disprove how bad this is , and don't say I didn't warn ya .
450639	2093818	91225	1.0	Just really , really , really bad	I honestly don't know how I've managed to sit through this P . O . S . movie even once ; it sucks so bad that it's impossible to know , or even speculate , how on earth it got through the entire production process , and all the way to the movies . The fact that this film isn't on the bottom 100 list here on the site is both astounding and scary . The movie is carried by usual 80's action / adventure clichés , bad acting , awful special effects , a wandering plot that barely makes sense no matter how you look at it , or how much you suspend disbelief . Believe me , the ridiculous dialog ( with lines like " No ! He'll hit you ! Duck ! " " And proud of it ! " ) is just the nail in the coffin . Seriously , what was wrong with the people who made this movie ? They get almost painfully attractive Lea Thompson ( probably best known as Caroline of Caroline In The City ) , place her in a scene in her underwear , and then they stop there . What's wrong with these people ? A talking duck ? Come on . . . I know that this was based on a comic book , but judging from the movie ( and its success , or , rather , lack thereof ) it should have stayed as a comic book . The film even makes Tim Robbins , a very good actor , look like a complete and utter moron , not to mention a poor actor ( which he definitely is not ) . The film is just so horribly dated and poorly done that it's ridiculous . Granted , it's somewhat original , but originality does not equal greatness . The film is basically a tour of the 80's , and a great example of how ( poor ) movies were made in the 80's . At least it did terrible at the box office , so we weren't forced to tolerate a sequel to this crap . Some might enjoy this , but I certainly didn't . I recommend this only to huge fans of typical 80's movies . Everyone else ; stay away . Far away .
449912	2093818	118688	1.0	The one positive about this " film " is that it was the last of its kind	If in making this , Schumacher attempted to create a film that looks and feels like a comic book , the man has either never actually opened one such , or all he saw was the bright lights , flamboyance and the worst of the text . This has all that made Batman Forever painful , only much , much more of it . The vast majority of dialog is puns ( Arnold has some particularly cringe-inducing one-liners ) , in particular the lines of the costumed characters , and they're obvious , ridiculous and in no way funny . Gotham City , once seen so dark and bleak , is now bathed in neon lights ( in fact , little in the film isn't ) . The tone no longer holds any darkness , it's just comical . All of the acting is overdone . John Glover later redeemed himself on Smallville , proving that he can work with material based on comic books without performing like he did herein . We did not need more parodying of the characters ; if anyone desired to view such , they'd go watch the 60's series . In trying to outdo those that came before it , the film introduces far too many heroes and villains , and clearly doesn't know what to do with all of them . Batgirl hardly has anything to do , and may very well have been added for the sake of political correctness , and perhaps because Joel wanted another teenager who shows up the adults . Pat Hingle and Michael Gough are still there , each playing the same character as they have since the ' 89 film , in what can only be extreme loyalty , contractual obligation , or both . As with the film before it , one villain's background is neatly summed up whilst we see a brief clip of the transformation . . . in contrast to how well Burton handled two transformations , in Batman Returns . There is no characterization present . Everyone is flat and one-note . The plot , that of it that isn't just recycled from Forever , is cookie-cutter , plain , silly , and at times makes absolutely no sense ( case in point : the master plan of the villains . . . excuse me ? ) . The cinematography is uninspired , which is odd , because Forever , whilst rather insulting , wasn't bad in that area . The same goes for the editing ; here , there's actually a shot that is reversed half-way through , which is really so obvious you have to see it to believe it ( perhaps the editor realized how badly it sucked , or maybe he wanted to be fired ) , footage seems reused , and lines ( unnecessary and embarrassing ones , at that ) are pasted where they clearly aren't actually spoken . There are cartoon sound effects used for some of the action . No , seriously . And to top it all off , this can't even be seen as innocent , pure entertainment , for if the many innuendos ( some really not appropriate for children ) were not enough , Silverstone actually has a line in which she asks her elderly uncle to dress her . No , it doesn't actually mean what one might think , but still . And does anyone actually like the butt shots in the montages of the characters suiting up ? Characters are yet again messed with , for no good reason . I've been told that one of the villains is essentially the complete opposite in this of his character in the comics . Batman , as well as Robin , always have the exact gadgets that they need , and the former's detective skills are helped along by the utter carelessness of his enemies . Dialog and characters that hold no other purpose than exposition are strewn about with a complete lack of subtlety . The special effects are usually pretty bad ? in Forever , there was little to no animation , or it was used so subtly , you couldn't tell . Here , it's plain to see , and it does not look real . Really , this has no merit . It is impressive , and in some cases ( read : that of the director ) sad that anyone working on this film had a career after it . And for this , Schwarzenegger went back on not playing villains anymore ? I recommend this to those who must know how bad it is , because there is simply no way to convey it other than a showing .
449856	2093818	318763	1.0	And here you thought the original was bad . . .	This is pretty much the first Jason Scott Lee film I've seen . I say pretty much , because I have also seen Soldier , in which he plays the villain . . . but from what I've heard , it's not considered a Jason Scott Lee film . This , however , is . And if this is any indication of the quality of such films , I won't be seeing any of the others . Lee is basically passable as a martial arts artist . . . as the lead , he's awful . He gets in a fight with random no-name characters every few minutes of the film , probably because the script writer couldn't figure out how else to stretch out the film to the minimum required running time for a feature film . The villain is the only character with even a hint of personality , and aside from the fact that he's certifiably insane , he barely seems like a villain at all . The majority of the film is basically Lee chasing the villain through time . . . or maybe it's the other way around . I can't say for sure . . . and I definitely wouldn't watch it again to make sure . The effects are not completely horrible . . . but it's close . The title comes from the popular idea of using a time-machine to go and kill Hitler . Somehow , the film screws up that interesting idea as well . The plot is too complicated for its own good . The pacing is poor . I can't think of one positive thing to say about this film . . . I really can't . It's simply too formulaic and pointless . If only I had a time-machine , so I could go back and prevent this film from ever being made . . . no , never mind . I just hope as few fragile minds are exposed to this as possible . Listen to the negative reviewers . Avoid this turkey . I recommend this to fans of Lee , and no one else . If you're looking for a quality film . . . well , this isn't it . That's for sure .
449946	2093818	295701	1.0	Brings new meaning to the term ' insulting to the viewers intelligence '	Values change over time . A hundred years ago , you were happy if you could live past the age of thirty and had someone you liked to spend your time with . Until recently , you expected an action film to be more than a muscled guy spouting poor one-liners and blowing stuff up . Well , I guess that would be recently meaning up to the early 80's . . . but this is really setting a new standard , breaking all limits and going through the bottom and setting a whole new low . When did movies get this damn loud ? I had to turn down the volume before the opening title appeared on the screen . Before I proceed with this review , I must give you an example of just how bad it is , try to give you an idea of it . About three minutes into the film , a guy ( who is clearly a secret agent , and clearly meant to die right away ) runs through a crowded dance floor , knowing he's been spotted . Instead of trying to disappear in the crowd ( come on , nobody does that anymore . . . right ? I mean , it wouldn't do anything . . . not even throw off the orientation of whoever is chasing him and give the sniper aiming at him a run for his money ) , he jumps up on the stage . . . making himself the most obvious freaking target ever . So what happens ? He gets shot . Big surprise . Yeah , but what happens next ? He falls backwards into the crowds ' hands , who treat him like he was stage-diving . . . ( backwards . . . unmoving . . . with a big , red spot on the front of his suit . . . honestly , how much does the film-makers expect us to swallow ? ) No , seriously . At that point ( well , actually even before that ) I knew that the movie I was about to see wouldn't have any value or serve as anything even remotely interesting . It's not even a decent time-killer . . . I've stared at spots that were far more exciting than the fake , clearly orchestrated action . I've seen drunks and stoners that were more coordinated than the gun hit placements in this film . The plot makes no conceivable sense . The pacing is so far off that I'm surprised I didn't fall asleep a few minutes ( not to say it wasn't a struggle ) . The acting is horrendous , with one or two possible exceptions . One thing I want to make perfectly clear ; Vin Diesel is NOT one of those exceptions . Vin Diesel . . . what kind of a damn name is that ? You don't have to be a genius to figure out it's a fake name ( oh , sorry , an ' artistic ' name . . . please ) . You want to know his real name ? Check his biography . No , wait , I'll make it even easier ; I'll tell you . It's Mark Vincent . Now doesn't that just sound cool ? No ? Well , apparently Mark didn't think so either . What's that ? He was convinced that he wouldn't be popular with that name ? Well , Schwarzenegger didn't change his name . Neither did Van Damme . They seem popular enough . . . right ? The truth is , Mark is just a poser . . . he's just another muscled guy who can't act but who is attractive to the girls ( god only knows what they find so damn amazing by that brainless jock ) . He spends half of the movie talking about how it's bull that video-games and violent movies corrupt the American youth , and you can't help but think about what he says . . . and realize it's true . He's the one corrupting them , he and anyone else responsible for this movie and any other of its kind . All this talk of anarchy and the general ' screw you ' attitude towards any form of authority . . . seriously , it's like they're trying hard to turn kids against parents , teachers and cops . Isn't America sufficiently plagued with young criminals ? And what the hell is up with the thoroughly misogynistic way of presenting female characters ? Just about all of them are whores and generally just there to please the men . No protests , no ' I'm better than this stuff ' attitude anywhere . . . they just accept that women are made to serve men , and nothing else . The one female character who isn't " giving it away for free " as my favorite character ever , Dr . Cox of the TV show Scrubs would put it , is still a hooker . I think her exact words are ' I could be your girl instead of his ( the bad guy's ) . . . if you would pay me as much as he does ' . OK , so maybe she isn't really a prostitute . . . but she falls head over heels over Mark , after knowing him for very little time . Finally , I'd just like to say that the effects are generally horrid , the action is dull , derivative and lacking in any imagination or creativity and the weapon / gadgets usually work as a huge tease . Being the big lover of weapons that I am , I was a tad excited when Mark was handed what has to be one of the biggest damn hand-cannons seen on film . Imagine my disappointment when the sap barely uses it at all . The same goes for gadgets ( less important , but still ) . Also , near the end , Mark gets to drive a bad-ass car with a trunk-load ( literally ) of destructive hardware . . . and it's only used for having the typical ' there must be something here we can use / oh what does this button do then ' scene . The characters are all stereotypes and clichés , with Mark being the guy who saves the world because he has muscles , a low vocabulary , a ridiculous accent and some poor one-liners , Asia being the girl who falls in love with Mark for no apparent reason , the geek who gives Mark his gadgets ( I won't bother to change his name ) . Eve even shows up , seemingly just to tell off a video game producer . . . because Mark won't ' sell out ' . Whatever the hell that means . Wouldn't someone fighting for video-games be honored or consider it a victory to have his own game ? I recommend this only to fans of Mark as well as mindless teenagers with no conception of how the real world works . If you're still not sure , yes , I do hate Mark Vincent / Vin Diesel . I really do .
449807	2093818	111301	1.0	Eh . . . wake me up when it's over . . .	When Jean-Claude Van Damme is starring in a film , you're already preparing for something bad , but this might actually be the worst film he's made , as it's more than just bad ; it's excruciatingly bad . It's not the worst film ever made , but it's close . For an action / martial arts movie , the fighting / action sequences are very tame and far between . The plot is laughable at best , and full of holes . The acting is painfully bad . The characters are badly written stereotypes , not to mention that the film obviously tries incredibly hard to implement all of the characters from the video-games in the movie , which results in far too many characters , and far too many supposedly interesting characters are pushed into the background and settle for cameos , to make way for the more popular characters . The dialog is awful . The script is horribly badly written . The " humor " is childish and lame . The film has so many unintentionally funny scenes that it must be a record of some kind . The fight sequences are predictable and , like I mentioned earlier , tame . There are also far too few of them , considering that it's supposed to be the driving point of the film , rather than the predictable and badly written plot . The film really doesn't have anything to offer , honestly . I recommend it only to huge fans of Van Damme , and kids / teens with nothing better to do than watch some badly choreographed fights by Van Damme and various badly trained actors . Everyone else , find a better way to kill 90 minutes and skip this one .
450855	2093818	367093	1.0	Not even particularly good for a B-movie	From the very first frame of this film to the very last , it's completely obvious that it's a B-movie . A modern , low-budget , direct-to-video no less , action-B-movie . As a follow-up to the first , it's very bad . It turns the plot and theme of the first completely around . The plot is lame , and very unoriginal . The acting is horrible ; there were times when it felt like a comedy , or a parody of the first . The characters are badly written cliches , derived from war movies and other B-movies . The cinematography is amateurish and lesser than that of the typical level of early film-student test film ( believe me , it really is that bad ) . The director ( or possibly the director of photography , or maybe the cameramen ) seems to have a fetish for pointless and very quick zooming shots , and there seems to be quite a lot of camera angles that are zoomed much too far in . I also hated a few of the pan shots , but there were not as many as the zoom shots , and they were somewhat far between . The special effects are quite awful , though there were one or two effects that looked decent . The heroism and stereotyping of the main character / hero is ludicrous . I couldn't stop laughing at the scenes where he tries to look heroic . The whole film is quite laughable . The attempts at humor are cringe-worthy , and almost every scene that is supposed to inspire fear , tension or horror , inspired laughter and mockery instead . The dialog is ridiculous , and very badly written . The action is tame and never really intense . The horror elements are derivative of several much better movies , and generally don't work like they're supposed to , for various reasons ( bad special effects , bad acting , bad camera angle ) . I know that this was direct-to-video , low-budget , and was possibly even intended as a B-movie , but come on , you can do better than this . Almost anyone could . I would guess that , given the same budget ( about six million dollars , I think ) , I could have supplied a better , more interesting 90 minute flick . None of the limitations can be used to excuse how bad the film is . Direct-to-video ? Please . So was Children of the Corn IV and American Psycho 2 , and at least they were somewhat entertaining and much more professionally made . Low budget ? Two words : El Mariachi . B-movie ? Honestly . . . there are plenty of much more entertaining B-movies out there . Take Barb Wire , for example . All in all , a pretty bad film , but fans of B-movies might enjoy it . I recommend this only to fans of B-movies , and people who wished the first had been more like a B-movie . Fans of the first should stay away . I don't regret watching this , though . It was good for a laugh , and knowing that it's so bad is better than wondering about it . If you somehow , as a fan of the first , see this movie , try to think of it as comic relief , a spoof of the first . It'll soften the blow .
450073	2093818	301848	1.0	One of the worst of the newer slashers	The slasher genre started with great movies like Halloween , Friday the thirteenth and Nightmare on Elm Street ; now it has degenerated into this amateurish mess of a movie . Most of the slashers , new and old , try to impress with interesting , and a lot of the time , extremely gory , death scenes . But whereas most other slashers offer some new , innovative ways to knock off their characters in no particular order , this just seems to re-use many of the old ideas . The movie is based off some of the same ideas as the Children of the Corn films , and while I haven't seen all of them , I can safely say that they are far better than this . Children of the Corn actually features some interesting and fairly scary / disturbing ideas , whereas this film just exploits the theme to explain why there is a maniac going around killing people . The plot is fairly boring , and seems to mainly be there for these characters to smoke pot , have sex or drink beer in every other scene . This is probably due to the original idea of having the slasher killer kill off teens who don't follow the ethical rules ( no drugs , no beer if you're underage , and no pre-marital sex ) . However , it doesn't work well . It just makes you care less about these characters , maybe even to the point of wanting to have them killed off , and just waiting impatiently for that to happen . At times , I found myself cheering at the killer rather than hoping for this faceless , shallow , one-dimensional character to live . The acting is atrocious . There weren't one single character that was well-acted in the film ; this could be attributed to the fact that they're all no-names , but that's no excuse . Robert Rodriguez used ordinary people , with zero acting experience in El Mariachi , and that contains far better acting . The characters are all one-dimensional , if they're not breaking one of the aforementioned ethical rules , they're mocking each other , acting unbelievably stupid or just basically being extremely egotistical . I never cared for any of them , and was actually happy to see them die . I was actually more annoyed at the fact that so many of them lived , rather than the opposite . The ending is so ridiculous and predictable , that no one could actually be surprised by it . The twist was also painfully obvious from the very beginning ; I had figured it out not long after the opening scene . Something I also found extremely annoying was the seemingly lazy attitude of the filmmakers ; many of the scenes , especially the death scenes contain ridiculous and obvious continuity errors , due to the scene being shot in as few takes as possible . The effects of the movie were also far below average . The scenes involving the killer inspire no fear in the viewer , as we either see him too much or too little ; both a lot and a little exposure to the killer in a slasher can work , but both require him to be presented as powerful . Slash fails to do so , the killer seems too human and weak , even though they were obviously going for him to be strong , judging from his impressive figure and his choice of weapons . The film just fails in nearly all aspects , never scaring you , but rather inspiring you to laugh at the pathetic attempt at film-making it is . I don't recommend this movie to anyone , not even slasher flick fans , except maybe people who know the genre and who can laugh at such a weak , boring , amateurish excuse for a slasher / horror film .
449797	2093818	387575	1.0	It's not as much the fact that the joke is repeated until we're more than just sick and tired of it as much as the fact that it was never funny in the first place	Here it is . The ( dear sweet god I certainly hope so ) last Chucky film . The last of the films , and the first that I've truly disliked . Wait , disliked ? Scratch that , flat-out hated every second of . The film is a comedy more than anything else , and instead of coming up with many good jokes , as every competent comedy writer would , Don Mancini takes the easy way out and jumps on the bandwagon with what Hollywood says is funny right now and writes just a few poor jokes and repeats them over and over . . . and over . The kid thinking he's Japanese and being gender-confused , Chucky killing , Tiffany trying not to kill . . . etc . When exactly did Tiffany turn sappy , by the way ? In the previous one , she actually yelled at a Goth guy for not having killed anyone . This time , she acts like Chucky was why she killed . Everything about this film is just so poorly done . We've got a kid doll that won't stop wetting himself ; a rapper / black guy stereotype ; crude sex gags and jokes forced so far down our throat that they're enough to make even the most tolerant person gag and a film that is basically making fun of all the earlier installments . . . and I , for one , am not laughing . The plot is ridiculous . The pacing is even worse than the previous two . . . it's freaking intolerable . The acting is incredibly poor . The characters are very poorly written and all clichéd and stereotypical . About half of them are actually just there to act as victims or running gags . . . or both . The dialog is immensely poorly written . The humor is awful . . . the comical timing is constantly off , and the punchlines are forced . Honestly , there's just nothing in the film to make it worth watching , apart from possibly the biggest of Child's Play / Chucky fans . I recommend this only to the very biggest Chucky fans , and I advise anyone else , everyone else to avoid this , or at the very least , approach with caution . I doubt I'll ever watch it again , and I can think of tons of very bad movies that I've seen several times .
450642	2093818	110675	2.0	Could have been a great campy / corny action-flick , but falls short	Just look at the cast for this film ; Andrew Dice Clay as main villain , Robert Davi as mystical bodyguard , Roddy Piper as a henchmen . . . do I need to go on ? Yes , the stage is definitely set for a cheesy , campy and thoroughly corny action-film . . . but it falls short . The dialog is cheesy , but not cheesy enough . . . there are too few one-liners , and some of them are a little lame as well ( which they shouldn't be ; they should be bad-ass and deadpan , instead they are tame and poorly delivered ) . The plot is pretty good , but it's too obvious a rip-off of Die Hard ( arguably the best of this action sub-genre ; the important - people - trapped - in - building - with - hero sub-genre ) and the pacing is not very good . The film just doesn't have enough campy qualities to keep it entertaining , and you're left with mediocre action and poor one-liners . The acting isn't great , but that's , of course , not the point ; this is clear for anyone who knows the names I dropped in the first line of this review . However , it's not good in it's own way , either . The characters are ( purposefully , of course ) clichés and stereotypes ; however , they don't work as well as you'd expect , in a purposefully campy film . . . they just seem flat and empty . All in all , the only real reason for watching this film is if you're interested in seeing the failed experiment at making a campy action-flick that it is . It's fun to see the various B-list actors , recognizing them from either cameos from big productions ( like Dice Clay in One Night At McCool's ) or big roles in other small productions ( like Piper in They Live ) or even small roles from other small productions ( like Davi in various flicks ) , but that's it . I recommend it only to big fans of campy movies , and / or of the actors . Otherwise , just skip this one .
451028	2093818	271668	2.0	I take offense	It takes a lot to offend me . I'd like to think I've been fairly hardened through the nineteen years I've lived . I can laugh at politically incorrect stuff . I find South Park quite humorous and satirical , rather than offensive and disgusting . It takes a lot to offend me . But this movie did . Dennis Dugan , continuing on the stroll he began with Saving Silverman which contained the biggest , most concentrated amount of misogyny in a single area , brings us one of the most racist films of newer time . Only , it's not what you'd immediately think ; it's not racist against black people . Nope , it's against white people instead . As if that makes it any better . Hate and fascism is bad , regardless of where it's directed , which group or person is targeted by and for it . As pointed out on the message boards for this film , every bad guy in this film is white , and Lawrence's character plays the race card every other second in this movie . Now , let me make it absolutely clear ; I don't hate anyone . I don't believe in hate . I have equal respect for everyone . I would have been just as offended had this movie targeted black people instead of white ( the film would also have been shot down far quicker and more broadly ) , or if Saving Silverman had been hateful towards men , for that matter . The plot is pitiful . There was a scene in a courthouse that downright sickened me . The crowd was cheering as a victim of false allegations was attacked verbally and sentenced to jail-time . . . as if they were watching a sports event . The acting is OK . The humor was offending ; most of it is Lawrence victimizing himself and berating white people . Both Zahn and Lawrence have been funny . . . what happened ? There's not much else . I barely watched this film , because whenever I looked at the screen and paid attention to what was said , I was hit with an offending remark or action and felt a strong inclination to turn away , to concentrate my attention elsewhere . One to avoid . I don't really recommend this film to anyone . . . except for perhaps black extremists . Even most black people will most likely find this movie embarrassing and painfully stupid . And Dugan : so much hate . . . so much anger . . . have you considered seeking professional help ? It can't be healthy .
450153	2093818	277371	5.0	Juvenile , crude and just plain bad	Parody movies , or ' spoof movies ' , can be quite educational from time to time ; we learned from the 80's spoof movies , those starring Leslie Nielsen , that toilet humor and fart jokes were popular back then . We learned from the Scary Movie films that the Wayans ' truly are talentless ( well , technically , we already knew that . . . but those films proved it , once and for all ) . And the makers of this film learned ( I hope ) that it's a bad idea to parody comedies . Even if it is teen comedies that you are making fun of . . . which are ( clearly ) not among the most intelligent comedies ( or films in general , for that matter ) . So , what is it exactly that we do have here ? A plot that combines plenty of comedies that actually did have some ( if not much ) comedic relief in them originally . . . stapled together by some writers who were apparently not working together ( judging from the disjointed feel of the scenes ) and filled to the brink with toilet humor and overly crude gags and jokes . . . why is it that spoof movies must always put some out-of-place humor into it , instead of just making fun of the original movies ? It would be so much more entertaining . OK . Back to the point . What else do we have ? A cast of totally unknowns with a few actual actors in cameos . And a director who's done nothing but spoofs ( mostly for MTV , which we all know rarely fail to deliver crummy teen-pop entertainment ) , most of which are short films . . . meaning that he was given feature film director duties for the first time ( and those that have seen this putrid piece of . . . " entertainment " . . . know that he blew it ) . But that's not all ; the film also offers a wide variety of bad puns , poor jokes , racial / gender-related / sexual / age-related / etc . stereotypes , age-old clichés and sight gags that are so bad that they have a serious chance of ruining your eyes and robbing you of your eyesight . . . which , if it prevents you from experiencing another second of this crap , might actually be worth it . This movie is just . . . bad . The humor is juvenile and crude , and all of it is painfully exaggerated . I recommend this only to teenagers who will watch anything . . . a group of people that I wish was very , very small , but know from experience , isn't . Sigh . If you can see this movie for free and / or you are forced to by one or more members of aforementioned group of teenagers , you might as well enjoy the sight of the lovely females . . . Jaime Pressly and Mia Kirshner are among them , and any guy who has seen them know how attractive they are . Apart from the sight of those two ( and a few other young , attractive teen girls ) , this movie has nothing to offer .
450807	2093818	305711	5.0	Simply not funny	I remember the advertisements for this film . It never looked like a movie that I'd want to spend any energy or money getting to watch , so I never did . As it aired on TV tonight ( not even for the first time , either ) , I decided to give it a chance . The plot holds little originality , and it's not terribly interesting or engaging . The acting is fine , but overdone much of the time ( seemingly more the result of the writing and direction than the work of the actors ) . The characters are neither likable nor realistic . They seem stereotyped and one-note , in spite of attempts at fleshing them out . Kutcher and Murphy have both given in good performances and been in good films , but here . . . well , at least they have fairly good on-screen chemistry . The humor mostly consists of mishaps , usually involving pain , with the occasional awkward and / or embarrassing situation . No observations , no wit , no clever references . Just unpleasant scenes . The pacing is OK . As clichéd as it was , I must admit that I liked the ending ( formulaic and predictable as it may be ) . However , by then , it was much too late . A film that's just annoying and not at all funny , this is one you should not spend time on unless you're into the Adam Sandler type humor of pain and embarrassment being funny . I recommend this to fans of Sandler and his type of comedy . Everyone else should most likely just steer clear .
451021	2093818	116168	5.0	Big Whoop	I remember passing up many an opportunity to watch this film . . . I would catch commercials stating that it would air within days , I never made a point of watching it ( in fact , I rather made one of missing it ) . Tonight , I saw it ( as the famous line in Spaceballs goes ) for the first time , for the last time . The movie is just not funny . I never laughed , smirked , heck , I didn't even smile . It wasn't charming , clever or even sporadically amusing . I'm generally not into movies about sports . . . but I have liked them . I didn't like this one . Didn't care for it a bit . Whoopi Goldberg has her moments , but they are few and far between . . . and none of them are in this flick . The plot is daft and poorly written . The acting is unimpressive . The characters are thin , clichéd stereotypes . The humor is simplistic and unfunny . The timing is off , more often than not . The sports scenes aren't particularly exciting or involving . The score is decent enough , with one or two great songs . All in all , the film is just not all that interesting . . . it might be decent entertainment for fans of basketball . But then again , the same could be said of Space Jam , and we all know the level of quality presented in that film . . . exactly . That film may actually be more entertaining , since it at least has one or two comedic talents ( take that , Goldberg ) . I suggest you skip it , unless you really want to see a basketball flick . I recommend this to fans of basket and / or Whoopi Goldberg . Everyone else probably shouldn't bother .
450513	2093818	91799	5.0	A decent sequel	After having seen the wonder of the first Psycho , and the mediocre horror-film reminiscent of contemporary slashers that was Psycho II , I was looking forward to seeing this , the third installation to the series . I am not exactly disappointed by it , as I wasn't really expecting anything particularly good . It's decent , as Psycho II also was . It builds a little more on the twist of Psycho II ( I won't reveal that here , for anyone who hasn't seen it ) , and though it did an OK job , I still found it to be too far-fetched to make sense , like the first one did . The twist in this one barely even made sense at all , and was almost totally unbelievable . The killing seemed more or less random , which wasn't a problem of the first , and ( to the best of my recollection ) not the second one , either . In this one , they just seemed to knock off minor characters whenever the film dropped in pace . The plot is reasonably good , quickly grabs your attention and keeps it throughout the entire runtime . It never really drops in pace for too long at a time , and you never lose interest in it . The acting ranges , of course Perkins pulls off the same excellent performance he also did for the first two . The characters were reasonably well-written and credible . All in all , this is a decent sequel . I recommend it to Psycho fans who want to see the entire series , but be advised that the film has a lot of ridiculous scenes , and the twist almost makes the very bad twist of Psycho II seem like the best twist since the twist of the original Psycho .
449814	2093818	111161	5.0	Tedious , overlong , with " hope " being the second word spoken in just about every sentence . . . who cares ?	I simply fail to understand how this film is so popular . . . it's quite simply beyond me . The only way I can explain it is that all the fans of King's short story found it very true to the spirit of the book , and voted 10 for that . I really could not find anything worth my time in this film , and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end , one or two good lines of dialog and the acting , there's really nothing in the whole film worth watching it for . It's about hope . . . and the director won't let us forget it , so it's repeated until the audience mumbles it in our sleep . It's like this short , one-note story was written , and the author just didn't want to end it . . . so he kept writing . . . and writing . . . until someone had the sense to break down the door and wrestle the pen from him yelling " for the love of all that is holy , stop writing ! " And I thank that faceless man for doing that , because it is undoubtedly the only reason the film was 142 minutes long , and not 284 , or , dare I say it , 568 . The film simply drones on and on , scene after scene , containing nothing remotely interesting ( but with excellent acting , mind you ) . There's nothing good about this film except for the acting . Just about all of it is great . I can't really think of anything else to say . . . I guess my dislike for the film stems from my hatred of King's writing . I suppose it is possible for someone who is neutral on his works to enjoy this film . I recommend this to fans of Stephen King , the actors and possibly Frank Darabont . If you're not a fan of any of these people , I doubt you'd find this enjoyable .
450664	2093818	305357	5.0	Just when you thought sequels were as bad as they would get . . .	Judging from just how poor the first film was , I'd have guessed it set the tone . I suppose it did , but I'd never have imagined the sequel to be even worse . The odd thing is , the film is basically exactly the same . It's like Terminator 2 ; just enough things are changed around in order to make it an actual sequel rather than a remake ( obviously , though , this is where the similarities between the two films stop ) . Every single scene is basically the same as the one in the first . . . with few , minor changes . Of course , being a sequel , it has to be pushed to the extreme . . . so that's what McG did . He took the first film and made it more extreme . So we've got the exact same structure , pacing and plot . We've even got the same twists . Yes , seriously . I don't know if McG actually did wake up one morning before writing this film and said : " I wonder if I can get away with doing the exact same film again ? Will anyone notice ? Will anyone care ? Will it matter at all ? " I don't know if he did say that to himself , but I wouldn't be surprised if he did . The problem with pushing it further like this is that the first was stylized and very . . . out there . Making that more extreme is not a good idea . The result is pretty much a feature length music video , and by the time the film is done , you'll be very tired of the MTV-editing , the high requirement of suspension of disbelief and the pitiful attempts at actual drama . It's so clear that McG is and always will be a music video director . . . he can't do films properly . The whole thing comes off as forced ; there's no chemistry or real emotion anywhere to be found here . The way the film is like a remake , but with some big details changed around screws up more than you'd think . The Thin Man has a different part this time around , and his character is hideously exaggerated . The new Bosley just doesn't have the charisma of the old one . Seriously , Bernie Mac to replace Bill Murray ? Please . The humor is terribly overdone . There's a gag that goes on for about five minutes , based on a one-note joke . Of course , there are one or two fairly clever puns and one-liners . . . but there are a dozen or two painfully bad ones . The cameos are cool enough . The extreme sports are too . . . uh , extreme . They're just overdone and overly ' macho ' . . . there's so much testosterone in the film that it can be used as a hormone injection . Really , there's hardly anything in this film worth your time . . . which makes it even less than what the first film had . Well , I suppose the sex and action is fairly good . . . especially in the unrated version , which I saw . But apart from that , there's nothing here . Absolutely nothing . If you pricked a hole in this film , it would deflate . I recommend this only to huge fans of T and A , possibly of the stars of it and , if such people exist , of the first film . Everyone else ( apart from obviously straight teen guys ) should avoid this film like the plague .
450702	2093818	280380	5.0	No real purpose	You know what I like about films ? You know what makes me consider ( some ) movies to be art ? It's the way they're unique , or at the very least have potential to be . When you paint or take pictures , you're limited to a visual representation . When you make music , it's audible . Writing , it's the story and the reader's mind you depend on . Movies have all three ; visuals , sounds and story . Something for the eyes , something for the ears and something for the brain . It's the result , the presentation of a lot of people's vision of one idea , one story . That is why movies , when well-directed and open , are great . You get the creative energy of so many people , you'd have to go through dozens of museums , music albums or novels to get something remotely as potent . Unfortunately , that doesn't help poorly directed and empty movies . This is one such film ; there is nothing here . No ideas , no thoughts , no creativity . The writer took the film everyone has seen a hundred times and around some minor stuff . Kidnapped child , parents wanting it back , try to trick the kidnappers and turn them against each other . It's such an easy way to make a movie , it should almost be forbidden . Outlawed . Not accepted . All potential future directors should take a sacred oath never to make a movie that had been done to death before they were even born . Now , onto the specifics of this film . . . the plot is vague and barely makes sense . The pacing is awful . That hour and a half felt like three times as much , and I barely even paid attention to the film for most of it . The characters and their motivations are nonsensical . The acting is fair , but wholly unimpressive , from the names on the cast . I can think of several movies for each of the main actors where they've done better ( well . . . apart from Courtney . She's never really good or bad ) . The cinematography is a bad joke . Half of the time , the camera is moving so fast that you don't realize what happened until half a minute after , sometimes even more . There is little to no suspense , and no real scares . The script is unimaginative . All in all , there's just nowhere near enough good things in this poor production to justify its existence . I recommend it only to huge fans of the main actors ( and even they should think hard and long whether or not they need to see every film featuring their favorite actor ) .
450395	2093818	454945	5.0	Just tries way too hard	I wanted to like this film . I really did . Despite loathing soccer , not caring much for ' mixup ' comedies and just generally not being terribly nuts about seeing this , I truly tried . The plot is a mess . There are under ( and un - ) developed subplots all over the place . The mix-ups are too plentiful and overwhelm you to the point of not caring . Furthermore , they're pitifully close to the level of the later years of the show Sabrina , the Teenage Witch . . . meaning , basically juvenile . Anyone with even a hint of common sense could have seen right through everything that happened , if it were to take place in real life . Every major character is basically a stereotype , and not one of them are even mildly developed . The acting is overplayed , the cinematography uninspired and shoddy and the overall directing is just lackluster . The film doesn't entirely stink , but there is a distinct reek of " inexperienced director " . Fickman may turn out to be a good ( enough ) director later on , but he needs practice . Lots of it . The humor is basically that of a sitcom . . . situational comedy . Take a bunch of characters , put them in an awkward situation and let things go from there . That's all fine and good . . . the thing is , the jokes never get time to delve in . Any comedian with at least a basic understanding of humor will tell you that you need to pause briefly after a good joke . . . let people laugh , let the punch-line sink in , let them come over the funny truth you just handed to them before you give them another . Fickman is blissfully unaware of this . The punchlines keep coming , at far too great a speed , and it doesn't take you long to simply tire of this . It tries too hard to make you laugh and comes off thin and weak . Sad , because the film does have some merit . Based on a Shakespeare play , the mix-ups are amusing and the basic idea interesting . The battle of the sexes is seemingly an eternal one . . . and this method of fighting it is original ( well , was , when Master William wrote it ) . Bynes shows definite potential , and had the script and directing been better , I'm certain she could have carried this well . As it is , the writing is too superficial , the characters too one-note and limited , and the overall movie just . . . hard to sit through . I laughed some times , and some of it almost succeeding in being moving . . . but then Fickman tears us away from it with an attempt at humor , making him and his directing seem as shallow and daft as the high school types he seems to make fun of . A fair try , but unsuccessful . I'm not sure I regret watching this . . . but I'm rather certain I won't be watching it again .
450346	2093818	1018686	5.0	Does what it's supposed to	This is an eight-minute special about the vehicles of Batman & Robin , featured on the 2-Disc Special Edition DVD release of said film . It could have moved faster , but it's fine , I suppose , paced alright . Editing is about the same . The only one of the stars of the film featured ( as in , interviewed , talking to the camera , and not just seen ) is Chris O'Donnell , who plays Robin . Apart from that , everyone in this are crew , the people working on the film , behind the camera . They detail the processes of creating them , and what decisions were made and such . If you want to find out how various effects on the vehicles were achieved , or find out what they were going for with the design , or just see clips of the vehicles , in use or not , you've got a decent enough chance of that if you watch this . They cover all of the vehicles , as far as I can tell , featured in the film ( I won't give away what those are , here , in case someone hasn't seen the film and , against better judgment , and the well-meaning advice of every single person around him who knows the film and wants anything good for the individual , is going to watch the film . . . you're not meant to know until you see them in the movie , I'm assuming ) . It's fine , if you're interested . I recommend this to anyone who fits in aforementioned group .
450386	2093818	102220	5.0	Decent plot , marred by awful acting	For this type of thriller , this movie is entirely average . The plot and overall theme is decent enough , but the film loses any potential it might have by featuring such lousy acting . Even Max von Sydow , who is a veteran and is normally an excellent actor was disappointing in this . The only actor who did even a decent job was Matt Dillon . The film also has a bad pace , it's far too slow ; in fact , it's incredibly slow and boring , for such a short film ; it's just over 90 minutes , yet I can't bring myself to sit through the entire thing again ( I did once , but ever since then I haven't been able to do so ) . The climax in the film is also below average , and flat-out boring . The supposed twist-in-the-end was lame , and not to mention far too easy to figure out . Also , the film introduces the villain far too early , in my opinion . Five minutes into the film , you knew who you were gonna root against . That's just too early . The film lacks any real surprises , as well as any great qualities . The few scenes detailing the psychopath's gruesome murders are decent , but lacks any real intensity or excitement , simply because you know exactly what will happen . As far as thrillers go , this is average and entirely forgettable . I recommend it only to the biggest of thriller fans .
450064	2093818	100240	5.0	Nowhere near as amazing as the first	Considering that the first is a masterpiece of fantasy / adventure that can be viewed by all ages , I'm amazed at how dumbed down and childish this is . The first had humor , but it was humor that everyone could enjoy ; this one has unbelievably childish humor , that only , and I do mean only , kids can enjoy . In fact , probably only young kids , kids who are seven-eight years old will laugh at it . Some of it consists of old cliches , including the " a person who the audience considers normal meets a person who is from another world / planet / whatever . He misunderstands some of what the ' normal ' person says or does " which is older than Stonehenge . Even some of what amazed or fascinated you in the first is turned into lousy jokes . Everything I loved about the first had been changed around to something bad ; the actors are all new , with one or two exceptions , the voices for creatures such as Falkor and Rockbiter have changed dramatically and now sound very bad . They even managed to screw up the perfectness of the Childlike Empress , who had the most moving and emotional part in the first , and was absolutely perfect in her innocent appearance . This time , they gave her curls . . . now she just looks like a regular girl dressed up as a princess . But that's not all . Not only did they screw up all the old characters , they also made nearly all of the new ones horrible too ; the gigantic bird is just extremely annoying , Rockbiter Junior made me cringe so bad that I nearly turned the film off . . . and I could go on . I don't know if the story follows the source material very accurately , but the story is reasonably good . It just lacks the ' adventure ' feel of the first , somehow . Or maybe it's just the jokes that kill it . The effects seemed overused , and not as well-made as they were in the first ; or maybe the first just did a better job of hiding how bad the effects are , instead of flaunting them . The plot is OK , but lacks the adventure of the first ; it never excites you the way the first did constantly . Despite this , it does move along at a pretty good pace , and you aren't really bored at any point in the film . The acting is bad for the most part , especially the new actor portraying Bastian . They should have kept the great actor from the first , just as they should have kept all of the other actors . All in all , the film lacks just about everything that was good about the first , and is really only good as a decent followup to a great film . Watch it if you want the adventure from the first to continue , and you don't mind seeing a much less entertaining film . I recommend this only to young kids who enjoyed the first or to any older fans who don't mind the ( extremely ) childish humor .
449921	2093818	179183	5.0	Fortress 2 : this time , Lambert is in space	Christopher Lambert ; the king of newer B-movies . The guy has been in every ( I think ) Highlander movie so far , despite the fact that only the first was particularly popular . He's done so many B-movies that one has to wonder if he is aware that the films are bad and doesn't care , or if he really doesn't realize their quality ( or , rather , lack thereof ) . Here , he returns in a sequel to the fairly low-budget B-movie action-science fiction flick , Fortress . In the first one , the prison was huge , and underneath the ground . Here , it's . . . well , it's still huge , but this time , it's in outer space . I guess the writer thought , hey , the first time , it was underneath the ground . . . the only place that could be worse than that would be outer space . I hope he's right . . . I surely do , because if he is , maybe we won't see anymore half-cooked action-sci-fi flicks like this . Lambert portrays the exact same character , which I suppose is good , as he was a decent character in the first . A few somewhat big names also join the cast , most noticeably Pam Grier . The cast of characters from the first are pretty much remade ( apart from Lambert himself ) , meaning that the new cast pretty much just fills the shoes of the characters from the first ( anyone who knows how the first ended knows why ) . Unfortunately , that means that the film seems more like an overblown remake with the same guy portraying the lead , rather than a sequel . The hacker from the first ( who was a neurotic , nervous guy , beautifully portrayed by great horror-talent , Jeffrey Combs ) is replaced by an annoying black-guy stereotype . The female lead is replaced by a girl from the resistance ( which Lambert's character is said to be a member of as well . . . odd . . . I don't remember that from the first . . . does that mean he joined the resistance after he got a kid ? Who'd do that ? ) , instead of his wife as it was in the first . . . apparently mainly because the scriptwriter couldn't find a good way to capture both Lambert and the wife-character , without capturing the kid . The Men-Tel prison commander ( who was played by the cool bad-guy actor , Kurtwood Smith , from RoboCop fame ) is now an annoying wimp with a ridiculous British accent that really gets on your nerves ( as opposed to the cool Smith , who was a menacing and threatening presence ) . The plot is a rehash of the first . The pacing isn't particularly good . The very scenes in the movie seems to be ( for the most part ) remakes of the scenes of the original ( talk about lack of originality . . . ) and the action is mostly just rehashes of the first , just made a little less exciting ( remember those way-cool machine guns with three barrels in the first ? They're replaced with dull futuristic-looking stick-stun-guns ) . The special effects are decent at best . The script is a weak rehash of the first , with a few added sub-plots , none of which being particularly good . . . most of them are just there to keep the film going , or put it an action scene , in order to distract the audience from the poor writing . The dialog is pretty bad , with one or two exceptions . All in all , the film is just a tame rehash of everything the first was ( which isn't even a lot ) . Somebody took the first film , said , " hey , this is popular . . . but it's not very good . . . how about if we try to do something of even lesser quality and see if people will like it ? " Probably writer / producer / actor John Flock , who , going by the plot and the writing of this film , really is as dumb as he looks . I recommend this only to huge fans of the first Fortress , Lambert or B-movies . Everyone else ; don't bother . There's a million better ways to spend 90 minutes , and there's at least as many reasons not to see this film .
449998	2093818	104291	5.0	Just average	When I first saw Elijah Wood , I don't remember if it was in one of the trailers for The Lord of The Rings , or if it was in the awful Disney version of Oliver Twist , I almost instantly loathed him . I loathed him for every possible conceivable reason there could ever be for loathing another human being ( almost , anyway ) . I hate his baby-face , his height , his " charm " ( or , rather , lack thereof ) and the fact that the three aforementioned features always gets him work in movies ( not to mention , makes far too many girls go mad over him . . . I suspect much , but not all , of course , of the female audience that actually sat through the Rings movies did so because of Wood being in the lead . . . ridiculous ) . I thought : " The only possible way Elijah Wood could actually be just a tiny bit more annoying was if he was a child actor ( instead of a teen / adult actor ) " . Then I saw Chain of Fools , where he actually is pretty good , and realized , hey , maybe I misjudged him , maybe he is actually a decent enough actor ( somewhere in-between I also saw the faculty , but that didn't really affect my opinion of him , in any way , shape or form ) . Then I saw this movie . . . and my worst fears came true . He was even worse as a child ( actor ) . His character in this enraged and annoyed me to the point of not being able to watch the whole thing attentively . . . well , I suppose that's not entirely true . . . the trite pace and poor execution of a pretty good idea helped a little , as well . The plot is decent enough , but the pacing is bad and the execution of the good idea is just bad . The ending made me cringe . The acting is decent , but since every major actor in the film plays exactly the same character they always play , it's not particularly impressive . The film was predictable and rarely entertaining . The characters were poorly written . The dialog had its moments , but they were few and far between . The whole thing was just too overly romantic and children's movie-like . The film takes a great premise and turns it into yet another bland romantic film . The end was surprising ( slightly ) , yes , but it wasn't good . It was sappy , sentimental garbage . Actually , pretty much the entire film was . All in all , this film is just average at best . I recommend it only to big fans of Mel Gibson , and possibly ( sigh ) girls who like Elijah Wood .
450453	2093818	179148	5.0	The Holocaust For Dummies or : How I Learned to Pay Attention and Care About the Prosecution of Jews	This film is very basic stuff ; the dream / time-travel theme , the typical war-drama clichés , etc . The whole film is just so bland and and the way it handles the serious subject . . . I don't know , it's just like a . . . Schindler's List Light ; you get the important subject and a few well-known actors , but without any shred of anything else worth watching a movie for . The plot is lame , just a rehash of the dream / time-travel formula , in which the main character travels through time because he / she must learn an important lesson ( like , say , Christmas is important , caring is important , and in this one , the Holocaust was and is important ; bear in mind , I'm not saying it's untrue . . . I'm merely saying that it's an overly tongue in cheek way of telling us that ) , and wanders about , constantly talking about things that don't exist in that time period , instead of wising up and keeping her mouth shut ; how many of these movies have been made , anyway ? They should have stopped making them back in whatever decade they started . It's too bad the important subject has to be dumbed down to a childish " adventure " just to make teens and kids aware of what went on during the Holocaust ( which the film arguably does a somewhat half-bad job of , since it's made into a PG-movie ) . Come on , I'd have rather sat through an informational but dull retelling of the story , instead of sitting through this tripe . The plot is tame and cliché-ridden , badly paced and not very interesting . Once again , too bad for a film with such an important a subject . The acting is decent at best ; not surprising for a TV-movie cast , but come on . . . Brittany Murphy and Kirsten Dunst can do better than this . They may not be the best teen actresses out there , but they're better than this . The characters are mostly clichés and stereotypes . The cinematography is unimaginative . One of the biggest problems apart from everything I've written up to this point was that it focused very much on the Jewish religion and their customs , which seem strange and ridiculous , at least to me . That made them all the more unappealing to me , along with their one-dimensional personalities and poorly written and even more poorly delivered dialog . But , maybe I'm just too anti-religious and atheistic . Meh . My point is ; you don't really care about these people , since their personalities are paper-thin and you know from the very moment they are introduced exactly what is going to happen to them , at least if you have any experience with the genre . Basically , the movie has a good point , but it's poorly presented and too much of the film is just poorly executed and ends up making you smirk or even laugh at what you're supposed to start crying at . I recommend this movie only to kids and other easily impressible people . I suppose if you must see every movie about the Holocaust , this isn't the worst either . You could do a lot worse , but you certainly could do a hell of a lot better , too .
450966	2093818	218817	5.0	A movie that just fails on so many levels . . .	I've read a good deal of the reviews of the film on this site . Most either claim that the film is an attack on Microsoft and Bill Gates or that it's a mindless popcorn flick . There is some that claim that the attack is justified , while some say it's exaggerated and too obvious . Personally , I'll have to go with a mix of these ; it's an attack on said corporation , and an obvious one at that , but it's also a popcorn flick . . . and that might be the core of the problem with it . It tries to combine mindless entertainment with an actual message and fails terribly in this attempt . The plot is mindless techno-babble ( quite derivative , too . . . The Net , anyone ? ) that lost my attention less than half-way through . The pacing is incredibly poor . . . the first half hour tells us far more than the remaining hour and a half , leaving the majority of the film being awfully slow and event-less . The acting is nearly unforgivably bad ( what happened , Robbins ? ) , and the casting is dubious at best . Ryan Phillippe as a geek ? Please . He doesn't look the part in the least . The rest of the geeks at least look like they spent some time in front of a screen , but he looks more like he just left Dawson's Creek . The film is packed with twists , each more ridiculous than the last . The writing is pitiful . The dialog is just bad . The editing is frantic and confused . There are several sequences of MTV-like editing , only good for giving the viewer a headache . The cinematography is sophomoric and daft . The whole film just doesn't really have anything to offer the viewer at all . . . apart from some fairly accurate computer-stuff ( as far as I can tell ) , which shows decent research . . . but what does that matter , when the film itself is so poor ? I recommend this only to pseudo-geeks and fans of popcorn flicks . Everyone else should avoid it .
450563	2093818	109813	5.0	Just when you thought your childhood memories were safe . . .	Is Hollywood ever going to stop remaking old classics , or turning old cartoons into live-action films ? I was never a big fan of The Flintstones , but the show did have charm , and was decent children's entertainment . This doesn't , and it isn't . The film starts off with a poorly acted scene that acts as a prologue to the film itself and sets the tone nicely . That means that if you're considering watching this movie , just watch the scene preceding the credits and you can make up your mind on whether or not you want to sit through the rest of this . It acts as a fair warning to even the most overbearing parent . As soon as this scene is over , we get a live-action version of the famous and well-known intro to the TV-series which will make even the most mentally hardened die-hard fan break down in tears and yell " Please make it stop ! Oh my gosh ! " at the screen . The film ends with a live-action re-enactment of the end credits sequence of the show as well , which most likely will bring forth the same reaction . I'm not going to lie to you ; I didn't pay that much attention to the film . It might have been because I saw it once when I was a kid ( almost ten years ago ) . But , more likely , it was just because it was really dull and downright offensive to anyone who is / was a fan of the show , even slightly , or anyone who actually does demand just a little quality from a film they watch . It's so tacky and crude . Honestly , I couldn't tell you one single joke or gag from the movie , and I've just seen it . My mind , my very subconscious represses it , pushes the memory of the film away from the surface . . . and you know what ? I'm thankful for that . No one should have to see this film . No one . It might have a good effect as a torture device , but that's it . Now , to break it down just quickly for you : The plot is dull , pointless , completely predictable ( in fact , almost painfully so ) . The pacing is awful . For a movie that's only 90 minutes , it certainly felt much , much longer . The acting isn't all bad , but it certainly isn't impressive . The characters are cheap clichés and stereotypes , mere cardboard cutouts of their characters from the original TV-series . The special effects are so see-through and poorly done that you have to wonder what the heck the film-makers were thinking . . . if they were thinking at all . Maybe that's it . They slept through the whole thing , and wound up with a bunch of finished film , had it edited by a man with two broken arms and sent it off to the cinemas . I recommend this film only to children , as no adult could possibly be forgiving enough and so indifferent to quality that he or she could actually enjoy even part of this film .
449910	2093818	465494	5.0	Sneaks onto the movie scene , misses the mark somewhat , and may die as fast as a target in one of the games	There are going to be two distinct groups that this will / may appeal to ; the fans of the video-game , and your average action fan ( or fans of average action ) . I fit into both . However , the problem is that those in the first group may very well find this as ultimately unsatisfying as I did ( which is not to say I was not entertained , or regret my viewing , on the opening night , here in Denmark ) , and that those in the second , honestly , could do an awful lot better . I've heard this described as Bourne light , and those who are familiar with both characters , even superficially , will know how wrong that is . As far as the action fans go , the action just doesn't work as well as other efforts ( though there are some fairly cool moments in there ) , and not that much of it is particularly memorable , though most of it seems to try , and want , to be . It's shot fine , though there is occasional confusion , and in at least one sequence , it was downright difficult to tell what was happening . The physical fights are somewhat ineffective , with so-so choreography and very obviously overdone sounds ( I would guess they were trying to make it " bigger " , which makes sense to do , but the execution , pardon the pun , needed serious work ) . One thing , that really hits any viewer of this film , is just how little coverage there is of the background . The trailer describes what may be the intended background for the film . . . but if you haven't seen that , you might not know much of it , because hardly any of it is present in the film . Guys , a hint ; if you're going on " people know it from the video game " , you sorta have to actually use the same background . Apart from the bar-code , the baldness and the . . . ( wait , that's actually it ) , the background really isn't that of the games . That is acceptable ( if it does rob the character of his most interesting qualities ) , my complaint goes to the lack of detail and explanation in the film . There's a difference between mystery and simply not sharing information . Now , to those who are fans of the games , some of which may very well have desired a movie for close to a decade ( be careful what you wish for ) . On the plus side , they did get some stuff right . They did not ruin the look by trying to give 47 hair , and the bar-coded baldy actually somehow fits in the film's universe , not seeming out of place . He wears his trademark suit . He does seem to prefer his good old Silverballers , and the ever-recognizable symbol that's been with the games from the beginning ( which , together with the suit , may be one of the things to change the least , through the four games ) . There're a reasonable number of nods to the games , and those of us who've been fans for years will recognize many things . Unfortunately , there is also bad . . . perhaps the biggest issue being Nika . From the first time I watched the trailer , I knew about her being in the film , and I had the feeling right away that it was . . . not good . Her inclusion makes this even more Bourne light , and , frankly , she doesn't do a thing in the entire film . She was added to give the young males something to look at , and to an extent , add emotion to forty-seven ( but really more the first ) . I would have had no problem if she had been added for a meaningful purpose , but when she spends most of her time setting up the title character's " I'm such a bad-ass " ( which he is , but we don't need it shoved down our throats ) lines , and / or walking around with little to no clothing on . . . it just doesn't belong here . It could be argued that they took the name , the popular title , and turned it into mindless action . The character's personality . . . he talks too much , even to the point of having one-liners . I would have liked more facial expression and body language . His awkwardness towards women is straight out of the games , but it did not work anywhere near as well as it did there , and it's not used well , if at all , here . The casting of Olyphant has both good and bad to it . He fits , more or less , the physical ( I am not kidding you , I might not have watched this at all , had Diesel actually starred . . . my dislike of him notwithstanding , he is not 47 ! He's a big muscular guy ) type , and his eyes and some mannerisms / movements do fit , somewhat . But I don't know if Tim has the range , or if he understands the character . Hit-man is perfectly capable of talking , but he only really does it when it's necessary . The film didn't have enough of the subtlety ( though it did have some , and it was pretty good ) found in the games , focusing far more on him killing groups of people , guns blazing , which , while possible in the games , is something that is a lot less beneficial and encouraged , throughout them . The pacing seems in a hurry , hence the lack of these sequences . There is some build-up , however , and I would say that at least one thing does pay off . . . however , almost all of it , well , just doesn't . The plot is rather messy and self-contradictory , considering how simple it is . The acting is decent . Ulrich Thomsen has done better . Scott has or uses an accent that , to me , was quite distracting . Robert Knepper isn't too bad . Cusick , whom I do like , doesn't look , sound , or in any other way , really fit the character he plays , not even the nationality . The dialog is not really memorable , and seldom very good . The tone can be crude , unnecessarily . One could have hoped for a more sophisticated , stylish ( when this attempts to be that , which fortunately is not often , it fails ) approach , more in line with the games . All in all , don't expect the greatness of the games , but you could do worse . I recommend this to fans of action-flicks ( not really fans of the games ) .
450290	2093818	398693	6.0	Informational enough	Featuring brief interview clips with about half of the main cast ( keeping in mind that the movie had a rather packed main cast ) , clips from all three movies and more or less every interviewee ( including Robert Rodriguez , himself ) ' s opinion on what the movie is , this is a fair behind the scenes piece . Robert explains how Tarantino pointed out how Rodriguez was basically making a tribute to Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy , and suggested the clever and fitting title , Once Upon a Time in Mexico , and how the movie then came to be from that , years after the conversation was had . The various actors speaking about what they did as far as stunts go and going into detail about their character ( though no one - the audience included - apart from perhaps Rodriguez himself , seems terribly certain who the Bad and the Ugly are . . . as this is quite clearly The Good , The Bad and The Ugly , the third and epic movie in Sergio's trilogy ) . It was interesting enough to hear , and the pacing isn't too bad . I would have liked to hear from Danny Trejo , and maybe Mickey Rourke , too , but knowing Rodriguez ' shooting habits , they probably quite simply weren't there when the interviews were done . I recommend this to any fan of the actors , the movie , and Rodriguez .
450445	2093818	271027	6.0	Sufficiently entertaining , but not particularly good	Let me start off by making one thing perfectly clear ; I dislike Jet Li . No ; I hate Jet Li . He's everything that's wrong with new Hollywood martial arts movies . Has he ever done a movie without wire-work ? Anyone who even thinks they know the first thing about martial arts movies know of Bruce Lee . He never did wire-work ( unless I have been grossly misinformed ) . And he was , and still is , one of the biggest names in the genre of martial arts movies . Anyway ; the one reason I sat down to see this movie was because the advertisements ( I saw it on TV ; didn't have to pay for it , thank god ) all claimed that it was directed by a man who I have immense respect and praise for , especially when it comes to action : Luc Besson . Then , the movie starts , I see how painfully bland the direction is , and I go to this site to find out that it's only written by Besson . However , I decided to see it to the end , as the trivia section said that there was little to no wire-work in the movie . For you people who like Jet Li or have no special relationship to him ( i . e . you don't hate him like I do ) , don't worry ; I've decided to direct my anger , no , loathing , towards the network responsible for the false advertising , rather than at Li or the movie . So , in this review I will try to keep the hating to a minimum . Really . I will . The plot is poorly written and entirely predictable . It's badly paced and dull , as well . The acting is not particularly good , not even from Bridget Fonda , who normally turns in a pretty good performance . The characters are somewhat credible , but they're poorly written and mostly just one-dimensional clichés . The bad guy is an exceptional example of this . The dialog is decent at times , but at other times , it's painfully badly written . . . a preview : [ on the phone ] " She got away ? She got away . . . how could she get away ? " . . . OK , maybe it's not the dialog itself as how poorly delivered the lines are . The humor is lame and obviously trying hard to copy the humor of Jackie Chan movies , with the whole ' different cultures ' thing . . . of course , it fails miserably , mainly due to Li's lack of charisma and charm . The martial arts are good . . . about the only good thing in this movie , actually . The fights are intense , exciting and well-choreographed . Not the best I've seen , but pretty good . All in all , a decent martial arts flick , but only good for a single watch and only if you're really bored , or a big fan of Jet Li . Otherwise , avoid . I recommend this to fans of martial arts movies , Jet Li and action films in general . Just don't expect too much .
450827	2093818	83502	6.0	Hit and miss , but some of the hits are perfect bullseye's	Allow me ( . . . you really might as well , because I'm going to whether you personally approve of it or not ) to start this off saying that what watched this as was an edited-together version of the six ( ? ) episodes that renders it a movie of not terribly much more of a run-time than 90 minutes or so . Not having enjoyed all that much of of John Cleese's work outside of the Monty Python team and their projects , I put off my viewing of this for a while . This was purchased for me on VHS , immediately following about an hour and a half of the aforementioned group mercilessly butchering routines they did perfectly fine on their Flying Circus ( yet another reason to put this off ) . I am , however , glad I did put it on . I was more amused , watching , than so much all-out laughing , but there are definitely some biting wit herein . The comedy varies , sometimes involving gross-out comedy . Some of the running gags should perhaps have been jogging at a more leisurely pace , because they kept popping up , and it wasn't always funny . The pacing is , presumably due to the chopping up of the episodes to make this about half as long , from what I can surmise , is wildly mixed , with parts speeding by , and others being slow . Not everything seems to pay off , which may again be caused of the cutting . Editing and cinematography are adequate TV quality . Acting is mostly good . There are some adult things in this , and it should not be seen by children . The writing manages to make fun of so many different countries and cultures that almost everyone can be offended , but they do hit the nail on the head with an awful lot of it , and points in this could easily be classified as satirical . I recommend this to fans of British humor and / or Cleese .
450412	2093818	122718	6.0	Decent spoof of war movies	This movie doesn't have very much going for it ; it's based on a theme that , no matter how you view it , is pretty corny . . . toy soldier action figures , fighting like real soldiers . Even from the guy behind Gremlins , that's fairly corny . He pulls it off decently enough , though . The action scenes and the various actions of the toys obviously parody various war movies , and this they actually do quite well ; the problem is , why make a war movie parody in the form of a teen-oriented movie ? Most teens don't care about war movies , since most war movies are from before they were born , along with the wars themselves . Had this film been directed at the adult audience , and gone for social satire instead of simple , weird catchphrase fun , it might have been something much better . The voice work is all very good , there weren't really any of the toys voices that seemed miscast . I really enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones as the leader of the army toys , and Sarah Michelle Gellar did a great job on the Gwendy dolls . Apart from the great voice work , I thought the Gwendy dolls were fairly lame , though . That seemed a little like the director had run out of ideas , and just went with whatever came to mind . I thought the actors all did a pretty good job , I especially enjoyed Jay Mohr , David Cross and Phil Hartman . Unfortunately , the film has more low points than high points ; the romance between the two main characters seemed unlikely and bland , like it was just thrown in for the effect . Also , apart from of course the basic idea of thinking action figures , the film has too many unrealistic scenes to be taken even the least bit seriously . Too much of the humor seems forced , only fairly little of it actually has the effect it's supposed to have on the audience . I also thought the whole idea of having the soldier figures build weapons out of power tools and the likes was a decent enough idea , it just lacks any good explanation of how they manage to build such impressive firepower from so little , and this actually bothered me so much that I at times sat there , being generally annoyed at a scene based on such an unrealistic premise rather than entertained by it . Half of the film goes slowly by , with few laughs , little action and very little excitement . The climax is decently made , and fairly entertaining , but all in all , this is just one of those films that you'll watch , and then pretty much forget about . It doesn't really have anything memorable . Even the effects look dated already . They might have been impressive back then , but they look so fake now . I recommend this only to fans of war movies who want to see a decent spoof of it , and maybe kids and teenagers who can accept a decent comedy .
450774	2093818	264695	6.0	" My dear Watson . . . what , by chance , are we doing in this ? "	Let me start by saying that I have not read the novel . . . nor any other by Sir Athur Conan Doyle ( although I certainly would like to , in particular those regarding this character . . . the detective , not the dog ) , so if you want to know how well this follows it , this is not the place to look , I'm afraid . The plot isn't bad , and it did manage to surprise me more than once ( if I would have been if I had looked my way through the book , I couldn't tell you . . . literally ) , and it develops reasonably . The pacing is fine . The acting varies , for all concerned . . . Frewer goes back and forth between what one might call a good performance and what would be more accurately described as a parody of a stereotypical Brit . There aren't really any stand-out players , in either end of the spectrum . The music is adequate . The technical aspects of this are average , and at times below that . The effects probably won't impress anyone . The " hound " is never that terrifying of a sight , and doesn't instill nearly as much fear as indifference . In general this isn't really sufficiently scary as to warrant being noted for it . I recommend this to fans of horror and crime-mystery stories , and / or Matt Frewer , but you are undoubtedly capable of finding more worthy ways to spend 90 minutes .
450789	2093818	97366	6.0	Not quite the first . . . which is not to say that it doesn't make for a fine viewing	Since I enjoyed the first , and this one also aired on TV , I gave it a chance , too . It defines itself very strongly as a sequel ( in spite of not actually referencing the start of this series , at least as far as I could tell ) . . . scenes and occurrences from the film it follows are redone with something of a step up . . . in intensity . It's perfectly clear from the start that this tries to outdo the other by making it all " bigger " . It doesn't all work , and on the whole I'd go for Fletch before this . The gross-out comedy for example did not need to go that far . . . nor did the sexual material . To be entirely honest , I didn't particularly care for all the jabs at the South , either . But it still is funny , and I was into this , as well . The dry wit returns . The plot isn't bad , if the ending is a bit much . Pacing is pretty good , and some of the stuff that is of a larger scale than last time around is worthwhile . The acting is fairly solid , and Ermey does a nice job ( and Chase ) . Hartman had far too little to do , for how entertaining he could be ( R . I . P . ) , though I suppose fully unleashing him would compromise the style of humor ( not to mention overshadow Chevy ) . The music is great . The mystery is interesting , and the script isn't bad ( though the man behind it doesn't seem to have worked since . . . hmmm . . . ) . I recommend this to fans of the character , the movie that came before this , and / or Chevy Chase ( people who like what he does , not the . . . man himself ) .
450248	2093818	106627	6.0	Average . . . very average	Watching this film again , after several years , after having seen many far better films since the first time I saw it , I can't help but compare it to looking at an old class photo , from a school you only spent one year at , and didn't like too much ; you recognize a lot of the faces , but you can't bring yourself to look too long at it , and soon you start paying attention to something else . Of course , you knew from the beginning that it would probably end up like that , and before you know it , you've pushed the memory almost entirely out of your head , once again . Yes , there is a good amount of talents involved in this film , and I quickly recognized Cary Elwes , who I've also seen in Liar Liar , Bram Stoker's Dracula and Robin Hood : Men in Tights , and Kurtwood Smith , who I only know from the original RoboCop , where he played Clarence Boddicker . Of course I recognized Alicia Silverstone as well , but I already knew she was in the film , as I had seen her in one film before seeing The Crush the first time ( can't remember which , though ) . The plot is pretty much a rehash of Lolita , with the tables turned to provide mainstream cliché thriller , in the vein of films like The Hand That Rocks The Cradle . The pacing is daft . The acting is decent , but one would expect better from Elwes and Silverstone ( then again , it was her first film . . . still , we don't see any of the talent that she proved she had in later films ) . I suspect it's the directors fault . Misdirection , or simply bad direction , can ruin a lot . The characters are the usual clichés and stereotypes of the thriller-genre . The film lacks any real thrills , and relies entirely on the typical formula of this type of thrillers ( the psycho-close-to-the-lead ( s ) - tries-to-kill-him / her / them ) . The film has no surprises and is thoroughly predictable . All in all , the film has no real purpose , apart from seeing Cary Elwes and Kurtwood Smith in different roles ( from what I've seen them in , at least ) . I recommend it purely to big fans of any of the three actors and very big fans of thrillers . Everyone else should probably avoid it .
450573	2093818	107362	6.0	A good attempt at a spoof of action movies , but a little too long	This movie is a spoof of Arnie movies , featuring Arnie , parodying his own characters . The whole movie parodies all the typical action movies , mostly featuring Arnold himself . I find it a bit funny that he himself is willing to make fun of the characters that made him such a big action star in the first place . Unfortunately , parody fun put aside , the movie is a little too long ; it could have spoofed the action movies perfectly well , even if it had been 20-30 minutes shorter , and it probably would have benefited from that . The plot is OK , but it's mostly just an excuse for a lot of spoofing on action movie clichés . The acting is not bad , but not particularly good either . The characters are mostly stereotypes , made to make fun of the action movies . Most of the puns and one-liners have a good effect , as well as some of the " continuity errors " and clichés . The only real problem here is the length , and maybe the few in-jokes that fall flat . I think people wanting a spoof of the genre will like it , but most other people probably won't . I recommend this to anyone who likes Arnie films and who would like to see them spoofed .
450931	2093818	64755	6.0	A step up from the first . . . but a pretty small one	When The Olsen Gang became a franchise , writers Bahs and Balling were quick to eliminate characters that were deemed unnecessary or simply didn't seem to make sense , in that the gang continues their adventures . . . gone are the hookers from Hansen's bar , Benny's fiancée Ulla and the two other kids in the Jensen estate . . . Børge remains , as the only kid of Kjeld and Yvonne . The acting starts to find a more grounded level , instead of always being so incredibly overplayed . Dynamite-Harry ( portrayed by none other than Preben Kaas ; who could possibly play a major drunk better than one who is ( well , was . . . RIP ) one , in real life ? ) , Benny's hopeless drunk of a brother ( who is , of course , very skilled in the use of explosives ) is introduced . The series moves towards the great films that we have come to know it for . The humor is still mostly silly . . . still containing a few mix-ups , as well , though most of these are much funnier and so infrequent , they manage to surprise you ( rather than annoy you , as got to be the case with those of the first ) . The plot is an interesting case ; not so much for the writing itself ( certainly not , it's quite pedestrian , not at all up to the level of some of the later films ) , but for how early the idea it presents came about in the series . The Gang going straight . . . no more crime . . . with the added twist that they are framed for a robbery they didn't ( but certainly could have ) commit . Added to the cast are now the well-known Ghita Nørby as the young , female social worker of Egon ( who has a school-boy crush on her . . . illustrated by the seemingly angelic light that appears around her person many of the times he looks at her . . . believe me , it's funnier than it sounds ) who helps the three " career criminals " ( before Danish audiences knew and saw them as such ) getting real jobs . Most of the jokes about about pornography are absent . . . as is the ( let's face it ) gratuitous half-nude women . In their place are more of the social commentary and satire that the first showed signs of , and that we know and love the later films for ( along with the daring heists , the human touch and the energy ) . Authority is made fun of yet again ( though less bombastically ) , and this time , German discipline and rehabilitation / psychology are thrown into the mix , too . Usually funny , and more often than not , hysterically so . This is also when the series start to feature longer films . . . the first was an hour and 20 minutes , this clocks in at not much less than two full hours . Arguably , much of this time could one do without . . . the scene at the bar featuring the gang , Harry and Mrs . Hansen , the social worker ( and a scene or two immediately following it ) is too long and could easily be cut without it detracting from the overall experience ( opposite that , however , are the delightful scenes at the toy factory , which are among the funniest in the series ) . But this is still a step up . A step further away from the mediocrity of not only the first film , but most other Danish films of the period . It wasn't until later that this series really started to stand out , but this is still a step , and one in the right direction ( it's always annoying when franchises start to step away from the path it really should stay on ) . A few key ingredients are still missing , and , overall , this film just isn't really much better than the first . It's still worth watching , at least to those who want to see how it all started . I recommend this to the biggest fans of the series and those who want to observe the roots of it . As a bonus , Poul Bundgaard shows off some of his talent as an opera singer in this film . Also , this has a fairly good amount of James Bond-ian gadgets . . . for anyone who enjoys seeing that in movies .
450083	2093818	397065	6.0	Wax on	I like the original . It's no masterpiece , but Price is cool to watch and the concept was different . I tend to dislike remakes . . . unless there's an actual need to update , the new director has something to bring to it , or the old film simply was not that good , and an aspect ( or more ) about it deserves another try , I am of the opinion that they shouldn't really be done . I could write a rant , perhaps even a lengthy one , in a review of one , about such , presumably concluding that sooner or later , this relatively recent fad ( lately , it's being done more than can be justified ) will have to end , as eventually they'll run out of other people's work to do-over , and creativity will yet again be a prerequisite of every one of the , and not just many ( hopefully still most ) , movie-making processes . But not this one . No , this one is actually fun . Turning the 50's piece into a slasher was by all means an obvious move , but it paid off . There are even homages and references to it . The plot isn't bad , and it develops fine . The acting is reasonable , with Hilton being the definite low-point of the bunch , but is anyone actually surprised by that ? The way her character was written was fitting . The script has some nice twists and unexpected events . The music worked well . The cinematography and editing show measures of inspiration , and among the reveals are great ones . The suspense and scariness is pretty solid , most of the way . The story is decent . I would advise against reading too much about this before having seen it , you may accidentally catch spoilers . There is a bit of language , a little sexuality , and a lot of violence , gore and disturbing content . I recommend this to fans of horror , particularly this sub-genre thereof , and those who helped put this flick together . It's certainly sufficiently entertaining and enjoyable for at least one viewing .
450906	2093818	486272	6.0	" Oh no . . . the Style-O-matic 3000 is stuck on hyper-drive . . . I can't turn it off ! "	OK , admitted , this documentary isn't constantly as over-stylized as I perhaps insinuate . But when it is , it's . . . not good . Not pretty . Coupled with a handful of really silly bits , if they are maybe reasonably executed , and the fact that it's edited from at least much of the same footage also used for the film's part of the Shadows of the Bat series , as well as the other special features on the DVD ( which are all of far superior production quality ) . . . yeah , this " making of " feature on Batman Returns comes to be a considerably less interesting special feature than , well , all the others on the DVD . The rushing editing of much of it doesn't exactly help . Still , you could do worse , and this does have some things that make it worth watching ( and some of it is decently cut ) , be it behind the scenes footage , interview bits or actual clips of the film . And if you haven't watched the film , this can be watched beforehand ( though it will of course spoil the surprises of the costumes and such , but hey , it could be argued that the trailer or poster does the same ) . Urich is a decent enough host , though he doesn't really help fight the stream of camp . The production is very obviously put together for TV , and seems to try to fit in too much , as well as make sure it can cut to commercials every so often . If you can tolerate the look and the cringe-inspiring gags ( believe me , " gag " is the appropriate word ) of this , it isn't bad for a viewing or two . And hey , like I said , the film won't particularly be spoiled for you if you see this first . I recommend this to fans of the film and the people working on it , and since this is on the new DVD , you won't have to go out of your way to find it .
450276	2093818	395253	6.0	Enough with the math , people , we've got a crisis on our hands !	As other of Bryan Harley's projects , in particular those involving Andrew Isaac , and often Jared Marshall ( and others not featured herein ) , this is quite silly . It's a spoof , a take on the trailer for The Sum of All Fears , or a fake trailer made for the film . It combines footage from the film itself , some other sources , and some shot by themselves , which includes the three aforementioned guys . There's no real plot to it , it seems to be the story in the film itself , with some changes to make it less serious . It's some scenes cut together , of varying quality ( particularly noticeable is the cinematography , both in motion and in framing ) . The editing is usually quite good , the meshing of studio-produced material and what was shot basically at their houses and such ( Bryan and crew have done some pretty convincing shorts . . . this isn't really one of them ) . The humor is almost all silly , and some of it is rather random . There's at least one jab at a real person ( take one look at the cast-list and you'll know who ) . I've neither seen the film itself nor a trailer , so I don't know about stuff specific to either . Pacing isn't too bad , but the whole thing , from start to finish , is less than three minutes , closer to two and a half than three . I recommend it to fans of Bryan and co . , but if this is the first thing by them you watch , please give more of their work a chance , this really isn't the most flattering piece you could look at .
450877	2093818	449579	6.0	Think about it	This is a special feature found on the 2-Disc Special Collector's Edition of Star Trek V : The Final Frontier . At first , I wasn't sure why it was , apart from it being about regular people looking up at space , but then it went into an analysis by one man of certain episodes of TOS , and , more to the point , one of said film ( and a line or two about it possibly being underrated ) , spending less than half of the production on that . This has some interesting people being interviewed , including Ray Bradbury . One would almost wish they would talk about other things , as well , as what I've already mentioned is about all it amounts to . I suppose the overall point is religion , and where that is in science fiction , specifically ST , and in particular the 60's show . How deities fare there , the relations in that regard , and such . The running time is about 13 minutes . It does hold nice shots of the sky and the like , stills and animated material , as well as what may be genuine , " live " footage of it . I recommend this to , I guess , anyone who feels that what I've described here sounds worth watching .
450541	2093818	78908	6.0	Attack of the romper-wearing mutant kids	I don't really know , about this film . . . it just didn't seem as interesting and fascinating as some of Cronenberg's other work , like Scanners and such . . . the whole plot just seemed a little tame to me , and I have to say that I found it kind of hard to be scared by a bunch of midgets running around in rompers , attacking adults . I know that this isn't supposed to be taken literally or anything , that it's a metaphor , symbolism . . . but unlike Scanners , I never really cared enough about the film to find out , or even consider , what that could be . It just seemed too far-fetched , and hardly scary . The plot is OK , it deals with some weird new experimental method of psychology , or something . . . to be honest , I wasn't paying that much attention . The whole thing just didn't interest me as much as it should ( and obviously needed to ) . The pacing isn't very good . . . Scanners was a little slow , at times , but this just seemed to drag almost for the entire film . The characters are fairly well-written . The acting is typical Cronenberg . . . meaning , not very good . The special effects are OK , but they are way too easy to figure out for the film to be scary through this . The music / score is quite good , though , and that's where most of the scares came from . I don't know . . . maybe this had a huge impact back in ' 79 because it was new , maybe I should have seen this before seeing Scanners . . . I don't know . I just didn't find it particularly good . The showdown at the end was very tame , especially the way it ended . . . the one in Scanners had me biting my nails at the edge of my seat , this one had me just barely looking at the screen . I recommend this only to very big fans of Cronenberg , and possibly fans of B-movies . Most others should just skip this .
450342	2093818	246677	7.0	I don't get it . . .	I rented this because I had heard great things about one of director Tom Tykwer's other films , Lola Rennt , and I couldn't find that anywhere . I certainly hope that film is better than this , because I didn't see any depth or value in this . I didn't really see anything past the nice visuals or the good score . The film starts out great , by one of the best setups for something bad to happen I've seen for a while . After that , it slows down to what is as close to a complete halt , while still moving . I'm not kidding , this is probably the most uneventful film I've seen for a few months . Nothing seems to happen . The very first scene of the film seems to be there only to have the last scene make sense . The film has the main characters running for the last portion of the film , from what must be the most ineffectual police force ever seen in a film , and the least seen . I get that it's not about the chase , that it's supposed to be a metaphor or something . . . what I don't get is what it represents . I couldn't find any hidden message in this , any moral to the story or any depth to it whatsoever . Yes , the film has a good musical score , and yes , some of the visuals are captivating and absorbing . . . but that doesn't make a great film . Without anything else than that , all you have is a shallow film that looks pretty on the surface . The ending holds some ambiguity , but apart from that , there doesn't really seem to be anything in the film to make it worth the effort . For being so short , it's a terribly poorly paced film . The plot starts out good , but doesn't keep it up . The acting is sufficiently good . There are a few good scenes of tension and / or drama . All in all , probably worth it for people into poetry and such , but us regular viewers , even those of us who are willing to dig deep in order to understand films probably shouldn't bother . I recommend this only to fans of cinema as an expression of poetry . I doubt anyone else will find any value in it .
450575	2093818	372765	7.0	Out there	The ninth and final Animatrix short , as well as the longest , running at about 16 minutes . This is the most surreal of them all , with downright psychedelic images . The animation is amazing , well-done 2D Animé with well-integrated and utterly stunning 3D CGI elements . One can tell that this was done by Peter Chung ( directed as well as written ) , the man who brought the world Aeon Flux ( the television series , not the movie ) . With a brief philosophical debate making up nearly all of the dialog in this , this also has food for thought , including some in the basic idea of it , in which there is great irony . The sound and visuals are impeccably well-done . I could imagine many not enjoying this on account of how weird it is ( not to say that anyone who doesn't care for this has that particular reason for it ) , it definitely is not for everyone . There is a making of on this , as with all the others ( albeit in a couple of cases , two share one ) , on the DVD , and it is an interesting watch at almost seven minutes . There are various disturbing things here , and it will be up to the individual viewer to decide what is and what isn't , really . I recommend this to fans of the Matrix universe , trippy , off-beat and imaginative efforts and / or science fiction .
451029	2093818	252503	7.0	Double-crosses and slang galore , but not a bad film	I didn't know anything about David Mamet before I saw this film . . . now I know that he's got a penchant for characters with ulterior motives and slang-heavy dialog . Going into this film , I didn't expect anything but a ( surprise surprise ) heist flick . I got just that . Not just a heist flick , but a well-acted , nicely directed and quite entertaining one , at that . The plot is pretty good , and keeps your interest throughout . There are a fair bit of double-crosses throughout , and near the end , it does get somewhat tiresome . The acting is all top-notch . Not one performance was even slightly off . It's no surprise to see such high-quality acting from Hackman , Lindo and Rockwell , but I had not expected such excellent performances from DeVito and Jay . The writing is very good , but Mamet uses too many clichés and there's just a tad too much going on in the shadows , people conspiring against each other . The dialog tries oh so hard to be clever , and occasionally succeeds , but more often than not , it just comes off as pretentiousness , with all the slang , the attempts at being clever and the ridiculously high pace it sometimes sports . The cinematography is great , not one shot was poor or out of place . The pacing is mostly good , though the film seems to go on just a bit too long . All in all , an entertaining heist film , but not one to watch much more than one time . I recommend this to all fans of heist flicks , any of the actors and David Mamet ( who seems to be all about these films ) .
450201	2093818	112740	7.0	Very ' Hollywood ' , but not ( all ) bad	I watched this movie with my fiancée , an American rightly proud of their military might . I wasn't expecting much more than standard Hollywood fare , so I really wasn't let down by it . The plot is pretty good , and presents a damn good dilemma . Neither my wife-to-be nor I could truly take either side . It's too bad the movie had to take one , partly due to the fact that the choice is a bit on the banal side . This is one movie where I would definitely have preferred to be left in the dark , for the film-makers to let the audience figure out for themselves what to think and believe . I suggest they watch some Alejandro Amenábar . Oh well . . . that's Hollywood for ya . The acting is solid . I kid you not , even Zahn wasn't an embarrassment . The action is pretty good , though somewhat limited . There's intensity enough to go around , the action just didn't seem to have enough scope , at least in my opinion . The characters are reasonably well-written . The biggest problem is that the two stances on the dilemma are just not fairly presented . We've got pacifistic and appealing Washington on one side . . . and Hackman , crazy old coot , on the other . Gene blows up near the end and loses all and any sympathy he may have garnered throughout the film , as the agenda of the film-makers becomes too blatantly obvious and heavy-handed ( made worse only by the very end scene ) . Anyone looking for something intellectually stimulating ( granted , a Hollywood movie isn't exactly the brightest place to look , but still ) should look past this flick . Mindless entertainment and less-than-subtle manipulation is abound here . The one thing , however , that the film achieves nicely is the isolated , claustrophobic mood of a submarine . Now , arguably , I haven't seen enough of these films to say for sure ( since this is , oh , well , the very first one I've seen ) , but in that respect , Tony does good . Well done , Mr . Scott . But as for the movie as a whole and the plot . . . Hackman is just too far away from being any kind of a likable character , and the trigger-happy , manic Gandolfini isn't much better , nor are any other characters on their side . I know most American cinema pits good versus evil , right versus wrong . . . but couldn't wrong at least be the opposing side ( the Russians ) ? Or , even better , be more ambiguous ? Just so it didn't feel that much like a lecture and rather food for thought . Anyway , if you can ignore and / or accept the manipulation and the Hollywood factor , it's not that bad . I recommend this to fans of the film-makers and actors . Just know what you're in for .
450053	2093818	68154	7.0	A review from someone who isn't really a fan of Westerns	I don't know , maybe it's that I didn't grow up with them , the way others have , the fact that I'm not American , or a variety of factors , but I've never been much for the classic Westerns . As with films regarding historic events , and films further back than a few decades , Westerns are something that I just don't make it a point to watch unless there's something special about it , someone talented at the helm or a major significance to that particular production . I watched this years ago , and I must admit that I didn't pay that much attention on this most recent viewing . It's just not really my genre . Some of the situations , action and dialog are admittedly good in some of these films , though . Technically speaking , this is good . Camera , editing and sound are fine . The fights look convincing enough , it does look as if the punches connect ( though I wouldn't guess that they actually did ) . At one point in the film , an unusual and unexpected group dish out some physical violence . One fight plays a lot like a football game . The humor includes some repeated gags and jokes , and one running toilet humor joke . The dialog has its moments . I recommend this to fans of Westerns and comedies set in the Wild West .
450421	2093818	453556	7.0	It averages out to an entertaining and well-done , but not perfect , entry	I haven't read much of the comics , but I understand that they are much more mature and complex than the campy cartoon series they aired , starting in ' 87 . They intended to make this relatively faithful , without alienating the apparently anticipated audience , the kids . This is darker , bleaker , smarter and less insulting to those of us who are not in said group . The humor is still mainly for them , in particular the couple of bits where this almost feels like a Scooby Doo adventure , though there are also jokes that can be enjoyed by teenagers and older still , without being too " adult " . This can be taken as a sequel to the 1990 movie , and this resembles it in tone ( albeit surpassing it , and definitely adding an edge that the film franchise hasn't had before this ) . It's difficult to say if the other two are to be considered canon or not . The plot is interesting , and keeps you watching . The pacing is reasonably good . The character development is nice , and this is definitely the most consistent as far as the personalities go . The voice acting is spot-on , Evans seemed especially fitting as Casey Jones , and Stewart hands in his usual great performance . The atmosphere is well-achieved . The cinematography is marvelous , with several " different " angles . The editing is sharp . This does utilize the fact that it's animated , in such sequences as Michaelangelo skateboarding . The CGI is spectacular , and the stylized look makes this neither downright intimidating nor overly " for the whole family " . You have to be careful , with these types of productions , that the visuals don't take over , but I'd say they succeed here , and they don't become the focus . The action is well-done , choreographed well and exciting . The licensed game is a fun companion release to this , without being required to appreciate this . The music is well-done , score and some rock . This is somewhat short , at just under 80 minutes before the end credits roll . There is violence in this , although it is entirely safe for the PG crowd . The DVD has a featurette about the people doing speaking parts in this , as well as scenes that were cut or changed ( including pre-vis material ) , and a commentary track by director / writer Kevin Munroe , that is well worth listening to . I recommend this to any fan of the famed turtles .
450866	2093818	120812	7.0	A good buddy movie	Even though this movie might be a bit conventional , it's thoroughly entertaining , with nice action scenes , cool martial arts fighting & a good sense of humor . I didn't find any of it boring . It's a good concept , to combine the humor of Chris Tucker with the martial arts of Jackie Chan . This movie is for anyone who's into action , martial arts & humor .
450314	2093818	70215	7.0	Not my kind of film , but I can't claim this to be without merit	Apart from the work of Sergio Leone , I don't particularly care for Westerns . They're just not my glass of water ( I don't drink tea ) . This is the story of a man who could become a legend , and a young man who wants him to be . . . " people need someone to believe in " , he says . Some scenes are good , and the major showdown that is hinted at , described in words , throughout the film , is quite impressive ( and if nothing else , a good planning job ) . The music varies , some of it is good . I didn't like the bastardized Ride of the Valkyries . . . and yes , I did know that that was the piece that was used for inspiration in composing , before reading the Trivia page . . . and reading said page reveals that Morricone intentionally spoofed his earlier work ( his scores from the Man With No Name series , the Dollars Trilogy , no less ) . The acting has its moments , Fonda is good . The editing is good at points , as well . It's well shot . I suppose fans of Westerns will enjoy it . As best as I can tell , this is spaghetti-Western . The point to the story Hill's character tells is also good . I recommend this to fans of Westerns and / or the people involved in making it .
450525	2093818	1114706	7.0	Doesn't entirely reach the top	Don't get me wrong . . . I by no means hated this . It's fairly well-done . The plot is good and interesting , and it had my attention from start to finish . Granted , it isn't always completely credible , however , it tends to be . It is a tad predictable in one or two places . The production value is quite admirable . The cinematography is nice , save for the occasional odd angle ( including the dreaded shin-shot ) . The cutting has moments that stick out like sore thumbs ( somebody , take the hammers away from the people in the editing room ) , beyond that , it's at least adequate . The pacing is fitting , this never lost me . The acting varies , but almost all of it is great , the names and unknowns alike . Plummer , as my fiancée points out , got better as it went along at hiding his accent . The character development is relatively strong , though not all the progression is believable . The political opinion behind this is obvious . The reasoning is a bit simplified , which hurts their case . The language is mild in amount , and moderate in tone , with a couple of harsher words . Now . . . was the Brit with the colorful descriptions meant to put that country in a positive or negative light ? I recommend this to any fan of drama-thriller , the actors and / or anyone else involved in putting this mini-series together and onto the small screen .
450718	2093818	116367	7.0	90 minutes of pure fun	As others have said , this is a movie of two halves . Quentin's and Robert's . There's no doubt about which they are . From the very beginning of them both . The shift between is immediately recognizable as well . I doubt even a little effort was made on anyone's part to cover any of this up . Why should they ? They aren't kidding anyone , nor attempting to do so . This is clearly , from start to finish , meant to be enjoyable , and guess what ? It is . Whether that makes it their weakest piece is up for debate . . . I personally don't believe so . It's no secret that Rodriguez does his best work when the writing is done for him . . . just take Sin City . . . and he actually emulates Tarantino's directorial style well , keeping his own , highly energetic and cartoon-inspired , under wraps save for his portion . Aforementioned , however , is a more skillful script author ( and herein , actually a pretty decent actor ) . So with them each filling the respective role they fit better , we're set for solid entertainment . And they certainly deliver . So do the effects crew . The music never leaves anything to be desired . The action is awesome . There is quite a bit of blood , gore and violence in this . Straight , single males also have plenty to look at . Clooney is bad-ass , with credit to QT for putting the words in his mouth , literally . The acting varies , but it's never downright poor . Savini isn't bad . The humor is twisted . The tone is cheesy . The pacing is about spot-on . The plot remains interesting throughout . Characters are relatively developed , certainly sufficiently . If you'll allow me to briefly digress . . . those viewing this and subsequently wanting a similar gaming experience , I would advise against going for the licensed release , of 2001 . . . I did only play the demo , but I was rather underwhelmed . I instead suggest Vampire Slayer , the free and legally so modification for Half-Life , as it is very obviously inspired by this . Turning my attention back to the film . . . go for this , those who are into Quentin Tarantino's dialog and story-lines , and / or Robert Rodriguez ' action and visuals . There's a DVD of this available with featurettes , music videos , the full-length documentary Full Tilt Boogie and alternate footage . There is also an informative commentary with the two who came together to make this , and it's definitely worth a listen if you like this . I recommend this flick to any fans of the people who helped create it , the ones who belong in one or more of the aforementioned groups in particular .
450574	2093818	451118	7.0	Doesn't get where it's going without stumbling along the way	I base this on the release for the PC . I'm not ruling out that some of the problems have to do with that , that this was geared towards consoles . Hey , I won't claim that this is all negatives , it isn't . This does recreate many favorite scenes , almost all they could ( albeit hardly any flying ) . It does , of course , expand on them , otherwise this would be even shorter than it is , and not all of this is bad . There are also new levels , the quality of which varies , but , honestly , there are several ( not all of them ) nice ideas , and done well , to be found in them . At any time , you can replay an earlier one , and twice , you're given a Mission Selector , and can choose the order of the next handful of them . The story-telling is OK , the worst part of it is the hideously , and oddly , cut up and stitched together Frankenstein's Monster of the trilogy that is the series of clips they use ( a couple of times , it even seems like they just thought " well , this was funny , let's put that in there " ) . Don't get me started on the crappy music they put to it . The sound is well-done , though the acting can be awful , and the voices do not always fit . Link , for example , and can someone tell me when The Merovingian became German ? The new plot has good to it . The acrobatics , shooting and fighting are probably the biggest attractions to this . They are a mixed bag . There are cool moves , but it is truly sad that they had to be taught how to make a VG taking place in this universe by the new Prince of Persia ones ( of 2003 , ' 04 and ' 05 ) , and incredible that they still managed to screw it up . And the guns are fine , if often useless ( and why so few ? ) . Aiming , well , it can be done , they actually put a cross-hair in this time , though the mouse doesn't move right . Now , the martial arts system , when you get past how clumsy it can be , as well as how sluggish and either too fast or overly slow ( that's a theme with this one , it hits the extremes , and goes back and forth between them ) it often reacts to your commands , it can be entertaining . There are a lot of combos , if you can activate them , with how similar they are to do , and on account of them making up most of the powerful attacks , the Free Form thing didn't entirely work , and you wind up typically taking them on one at a time . There are not enough buttons devoted to it . Meleé weapons range , but tend to be a positive in this . The Bosses . . . do not . Defending by striking could be fantastic , but it wasn't really , here . The camera is free , with zoom and 360 degree turning . The abilities are decent enough , the main thing here is that each you get is helpful a little , and that's it . The adventure portions are nothing but a method of prolonging this . They were happy to make it possible for characters to be tossed about , and objects ( as well as walls ) around you to break , so it's happening all over the place , and it quite frankly looks preposterous . This makes the astounding occurrences in the three commonplace , and they lose their impact . The bugs and glitches are all over this , and stability could be better . The graphics are great , with fluid animation , if at least one of the faces ( Smith ) come out looking ridiculous . Cut-scenes are , with one exception ( which is CGI , and gorgeous ) , in-engine , and fair . This does manage to put a lot of you-know-who's in one place , up against you , lets you squeeze the trigger in the chopper , and features aerial combat . This is either too easy , or annoying , depending on what specific portion you're playing . Replayability is essentially nonexistent . There is bonus stuff , including an extraordinarily unfunny outtake reel . Saving is still automatic , and offering only four slots . The puns are gag-inducing . The altered continuity is reasonable . This takes some of the best moments in the original film and makes gimmicks out of them . Why all the silliness ? The changed ending ( cheap attempt at getting audiences to purchase this , contact me and I'll let you know what it is ) , which I actually don't consider to be a poor concept , it's merely wrong for this ? My guess would be that the brothers saw the reception the sequels got , and got scared , gave up trying , or perhaps both . Thus they almost invariably ( there is philosophy in this , and situations that could really be impeccable ) didn't try to make this serious . I would hate to think that they belong in the group of people who refuse to believe that games can be complex and innovative , after what they did to the action flick genre , and reinvigorating the science fiction cinema . A tremendous lot can be achieved in this medium , and the only cause for alarm at these being less than stellar is the sheer fact that done right , an effort of this kind , inside the Matrix universe could be excellent . This , however , is downright stupid . Superficial and empty aren't off the wall as words to describe it . Not to mention ammo for those who claim that the 1999 movie was nothing but a stroke of luck . It's a terrible waste of potential . In case you weren't sure , I've been comparing this to Enter the Matrix ( so much that I didn't write where I did so ) . All in all , I'm sorry , I find that to be the superior title . Less frustration , comes closer to you being able to count on it to deliver , and while both overreach , the result here is at times painful . This has , well , not direct sexuality , but adult material , as well as language , relatively strong , not in copious amounts . I recommend this to fans of the franchise , if you prefer the visuals and battles to the exploration and the food for thought ( perfectly acceptable , I simply feel that what the Wachowski's made deserves more ) .
450651	2093818	178130	7.0	Not bad , for a TV-movie	I don't know much about Cleopatra . . . well , to tell you the truth , before watching this , I didn't know anything at all . The name ringed a bell , and that's about it . I bought this along with the 1997 TV version of The Odyssey partly because my father expressed interest in seeing them , and partly out of my own interest in the epics . While , according to my father , this film gets many details right , it still throws some stuff in that makes little to no sense and which is hardly historically accurate ; some parts were obviously doctored to make for more drama or Hollywood-like scenes ( at one point , Cleopatra picks up a sword to fight several Roman legionnaires with ease ) . The sets and costumes are gorgeous , no argument there . Most of the effects were see-through , but that's no wonder for a TV-movie with a TV-movie budget . The costume people are all in my cool book , though , if for nothing else , putting Leonor Varela in so many sheer , thin and / or tight dresses throughout the film . The plot is mostly accurate . The pacing is fair . Much of the film was clearly based on the real events , the real clothes worn and the real places . They must have done extensive research , and it definitely shows . Bit of a pity they throw away some credibility with aforementioned Hollywood scenes . The acting is fairly good ; Zane , as usual , does not disappoint . Dalton proved to me that he had talent , something I never would have believed about him before . Varela is decent . The visual side of the film is fine , but nothing innovative or impressive is to be found here . Same goes for the depth of the film . I enjoyed the somewhat erotic , though at times nearly soap-opera-like relationships Cleopatra had , but I can see why some wouldn't . All in all , it tells the story ( most of it ) and looks ' real ' enough . Nothing mighty impressive , but most of us have come to expect much , much less of the typical TV-movie . I recommend this to people who want a retelling of the story and want drama more than accuracy .
450134	2093818	147800	7.0	Very good romantic teen-comedy	This is one of the relatively few romantic comedies that are actually based on a good premise , and , as such , it's watchable for guys too . It's very funny , the humor is well-placed and perfectly timed . The romantic scenes aren't sappy or boring . The chemistry works out pretty well between the actors ; you actually believe that these characters would get together , realistically . I read that it's based on Shakespeare's " the taming of the shrew " ; now , since I haven't read that , I can't comment on how good the movie is compared to it , but as far as I know , the basic idea and theme is the same , as is most of the plot , and , considering that , it's a very good modernization of the story . The plot is good and involving , you are interested in what happens to these characters . The acting is all good . The script is well-written , and allows for the characters to be in some very funny scenes . The humor is directed at teens , but it isn't crude or offending , except for a few scenes , and even then , it's not too bad . I found it interesting how the focus completely shifted , in the last part of the film . . . the lead characters became supporting ones , whilst ones that were supporting before are now leads . I leave answering the question of whether or not this is true to Shakespeare's original text ( or at least in the general spirit of him ) up to those who have read his work . A good comedy for teens to watch , probably good for teen couples too . I recommend this to most people who enjoy teen comedies .
450492	2093818	69945	7.0	In space , no one can see you be weird	Being that this is one of the first of Carpenter's works , and that it had O'Bannon's involvement ( more the former than the latter ) , I made it a point to get to watch it . I noticed that , for being listed a comedy , there aren't that many laughs in it . . . which is not at all to say that it isn't funny , portions of it certainly are , with several kinds of humor blended together well . . . some is clever , there's a remarkably well-done absurdity bit ( and more than one thing herein is bizarre ) , and there are black parts , as well . Not every gag or joke works , and with how far there can be between them , I should think that someone just going into this expecting only that will leave disappointed . Meanwhile , if you dig John and the other two genres , you're likely to have a great time . There is genuine tension ( he managed to do that skillfully even then ) , and among the technology and such are interesting aspects to be found ( according to the Trivia , a little of it was even inspired by two marvelous writers in the field ) . Music , as usual on one of his films , is done by John Carpenter himself , and also to be expected , is really good ( if not necessarily his best or most memorable ) . Cinematography , editing and effects all show promise of things to come , from both men . Acting could be better . Writing varies , but there is the occasional nugget of pure gold . I recommend this to any fan of Mr . Carpenter and / or Dan , as well as those who are into sci-fi .
450245	2093818	384001	7.0	In some ways , better than the first game	Yet again , Earth needs the help of heroic young boy Billy Blaze , aka ( once he's wearing his brother's football helmet ) Commander Keen . As he returns to Earth , he sees a huge spacecraft hovering over the planet . . . the Vorticon mother-ship . They had attempted to keep him from returning to Earth , as they realized that he was the only one who could stop their evil schemes . . . but Keen won that time , and with your help , he will , this time , too . The entire game takes place on the mother-ship . The Vorticons are intending to blow up the planet ( as the title alludes to ) , through targeting eight of the largest cities , and Keen must single-handedly destroy all of the laser cannons ( or Tantalus Rays , as they are known in the game ) aimed at the cities in order to stop them and ensure that the world is safe . The story is more epic and exciting than that of the first . . . whilst it certainly was fun to collect the parts of the Bean-and-Bacon Megarocket to enable the Commander to fly back to his home planet , saving said planet is somewhat more interesting . I would say that the first game works well as an introduction to the universe , character and series , and this raises the stakes and is a solid sequel . A few new features are added , one of which can be recognized from the later games , such as the two in Goodbye Galaxy ! , namely , moving platforms . Light switches are also added , but I will leave it up to the players to find out what they are good for ( though I will say that they are extremely helpful ) . The general surroundings are considerably more hostile towards Keen . . . where the first game took place on a planet inhabited by both friendly , agreeable aliens and . . . less friendly ones , this has you inside the mother-ship of some aliens that are dead-set on destroying your home-planet ( though you do find out something interesting in the game , regarding that . . . all may not be what it seems ) . As such , the Vorticons themselves are not your only concern , since the ship is full of complicated technology powering and running it , quite a bit of which is lethal to eight-year-old human boys . The robots aren't exactly the most forgiving type , either , in particular the variety that fly back and forth , occasionally firing three quick blasts of energy . However , the small ones who merely push you ( which , in itself , with such dangerous surroundings , can be enough to kill Keen ) may prove useful more often than not . The colors are somewhat more grey in this , though not exactly bleak ( it definitely is still a children's game ) . Between the end of the last game , and the start of this , Keen has gained a new ray gun , one belonging to an elite warrior of the Vorticon race . . . this proves to be more powerful than his own from the first game , so he keeps it throughout the entire game . Essentially , this means that you can now shoot those pesky wolf-like things , which were invincible in the first game . The controls remain the same , " heavy " , laggy , bordering on ( and occasionally crossing that line to ) clumsy , and with the trial of two-button shooting , which causes problems when trying to fight enemies , one in particular , who takes three rounds to go down , is able to shoot back ( and only one shot is necessary to take Keen out of the equation ) , jumps high and moves fast . In-game saving is missed , though I will admit that I only got to play this and the other two parts of the trilogy after having completed Goodbye Galaxy ! ( or , more accurately , the first part of it , Secret of the Oracle , the fourth entry into the series ) and Keen Dreams , so I was perhaps spoiled . There is still no difficulty setting , either , though the game does pose a reasonable challenge . Wikipedia even lists this as the most difficult of the trilogy , though I would say that the third is , each game in Invasion of the Vorticons ( the first three games ) gets more difficult than the last . The game takes a little longer to complete , not to mention more skill and perseverance . The game-play is about the same as that of the first . There are a few puzzles to solve , and some time is spent locating key-cards and generally finding your way through the levels . You get to choose the order of the levels again , well , within reason , that is . Level design is quite good . The humor is the same cartoony brand as the first , directed mainly towards but by no means exclusively appealing to , children ( and like with the first , there really isn't so much of it that you can't simply ignore it if it downright bothers you ) . The platform gaming remains fun , and the additions make things more interesting . It's also quite entertaining to play . Once again , extra lives are gained through amassing enough points , which will also ultimately count towards your ranking on the high score list which is still the main incentive in the series towards replaying the game , and this list will also say how many of the eight cities you managed to save from laser-induced annihilation before the game ended . The sound is still somewhat simple , but it's good for what it is . The graphics aren't marvelous , and they are 2D , all the way , but they aren't bad . While I'm not sure I'd say that the series has achieved the greatness that started in the " interlude " , the lost episode , Keen Dreams , which was made between the trilogy and the later three official Commander Keen Games ( the Goodbye Galaxy ! series and Aliens Ate My Babysitter ! ) and continued through the last three games ( I have yet to play the Game Boy Color version , and from what I've read of descriptions , I doubt I will make much , if any , effort towards doing so ) , this is about as good as the first game , and surpasses it in a few areas . I recommend this fun little game to fans of the Commander Keen series , and to fans of DOS games and / or platform games .
450326	2093818	272557	7.0	A pretty good virus thriller	This movie is thoroughly exciting , if not much else , and it has a good sense of humor . It was tense throughout it's entire run time . Pretty much none of the actors are big names , but they give believable performances , pretty much every one of them . I honestly didn't expect much from this movie , but it surprised me , as it was actually pretty good . I haven't seen a lot of the other virus thrillers , so the genre is new to me ; however , I think this was a pretty good movie of that genre . The whole plot was pretty good , apart from the somewhat anticlimactic ending , that just seemed pretty far fetched , but hey , not all movies end the way you want them to . I liked most of the main characters , the wisecracking president , the intelligent doctor , both of the terrorists , all were interesting characters , and they were all pretty well developed . I think most people who enjoy thrillers , and especially fans of virus thrillers , will enjoy this . While not featuring big famous actors , it's pretty good nonetheless .
450115	2093818	93773	7.0	I realize more or less why it's loved , yet I cannot seem to get into this	Why , you ask ? At least that's the question I assume is on your mind , since you decided to read this , instead of skipping it . I'm not entirely certain . Let me assure you , I am a fan of the creature . The same goes for Arnie ( no , I wasn't calling him a . . . never mind ) . In fact , claiming that I am one of the director , as well , wouldn't be stretching it even a little . And I dig tension , horror and thrillers ( not to mention the genre The Governator commonly stars in , and science fiction ) . So by all means , I should be of the same opinion about this as the majority seems to . Maybe I was spoiled by the first AvP game , and / or seeing the sequel to this . Perhaps I just don't buy McTiernan's attempts at suspense . It isn't impossible that it's how the first couple of scenes of this set it up to be the typical Schwarzenegger flick to such an extent that if it had been cut immediately after , it would simply be known as the shortest of such ever , with a few brief things that have nothing to do with the rest ( you'll know them if you ever do view it , or have ) . In the end , I don't really know . Could be all , maybe only one , heck , doesn't have to be any of ' em . With that said . . . there are good things herein . Hall did very nice ( R . I . P . ) . The acting is mostly great ( with only a handful of exceptions ) , and the characters are cool . The special effects hold up fairly well , and there are some nice moments in them . Cinematography and editing tend to be quality stuff . Like Alien , this works well to introduce the title being . I recommend this to fans of the people involved in making it .
449817	2093818	142688	7.0	I don't get it . . .	Just after seeing this film , I didn't understand it , or know what to make of it . Not being a huge fan of ignorance , I went ahead and read a few different analysis's , and I think I've pretty much figured out what the film means now . I'd probably have to watch it at least once more to understand it , though . I get what it's about and several of the interpretations of it make nearly perfect sense . . . but I'm left still not understanding large parts of the movie . Therefore , this review will be entirely based on the film as entertainment , and as a piece of art that wasn't understood by the author of the review ( yours truly ) . First off , like most other Polanski films ( at least to my recollection ) , this features some great dialog , an involving story and a likable lead character . The plot is very good , and it evolves nicely throughout the film . The pacing is very good , I was rarely bored . It seems to go out the window near the end , though . The final few scenes seemed tacked on as a result . The acting is all top notch . . . there wasn't one single character who I found poorly acted . The cinematography is exceptional , though I have come to expect nothing less from Polanski . Roman reuses Emmanuelle Seigner , the young French beauty he earlier used in Frantic . She does an equally good job in this film . She's mysterious , hypnotizing and alluring . Though I don't understand her native tongue , I believe I'll have to find some of her other films , just to see more of her . Polanski certainly knew what he was doing when he chose her for the part . All in all , a very good horror-mystery-thriller , which should entertain even the most critical fan of any of those three genres . Unless you're into western religion , however , you will probably have the same reaction as me ( not understanding it ) . I recommend this to any fan of Polanski , Seigner and films with supernatural undertones .
450309	2093818	309593	7.0	More gory than the first , but not as good	The director obviously thought that when making a sequel , everything has to be bigger and heavier . But bigger doesn't equal better , and it definitely isn't the case here . The death scenes are unnecessary gory , and only that ; practically no build-up to the scenes , and little to no excitement . Unless you enjoy watching extremely bloody , gory death scenes , you won't like this movie . In fact , you will most likely hate it , unless you're a big fan of the genre , or of the first Final Destination . It's a huge gore fest , and probably made for ( and maybe even by ) fans of the old " body-count " movies , from the 1980's . It has very little realism ; whereas the first Final Destination had some realism in the death scenes , this had little to none at all . As many other slasher movies , it has the little " twist-in-the-end " at the very end , but it is very weak , considering what it could have been . The first movie is a lot better , but if you need to watch a gory movie where you pretty much sit around and wait for people to die , this isn't the worst you can watch . But if the choice is between this and the first , I would definitely choose the first .
450296	2093818	109831	7.0	Pretty good British romantic comedy	From the very beginning , it's clear that this is a different kind of romantic comedy . The characters are more thoroughly developed and the general tone is quite different from what one is used to from this genre . I mainly watched this because I had nothing else planned , it aired on TV , and I enjoy the work of Richard Curtis , who wrote this . I very much like the BlackAdder series and I found his directing effort ( which he also wrote ) , Love Actually to be rather well-done . The plot is fairly good . . . the idea of having a small group of friends attend several weddings , all the while meeting new people ( not to mention old " friends " ) and contemplating where their own love-life ( or lack thereof ) is headed was a great one , and it works out very well . The pacing is solid , for the very most part . Few ( but still some ) scenes seem drawn-out . Atkinson's character is basically a one-note joke , but his part is fortunately sufficiently small to not disrupt the flow . The acting is mostly magnificent , with a few exceptions . MacDowell clearly displays the lack of preparation that the top trivia entry alludes to . The humor is quite British , and almost entirely verbal . As such , I , personally , enjoyed the very majority of it . Anyone who isn't familiar with it or simply doesn't find it funny probably won't find much entertainment value in this . With quirky characters and sit-com situations / scenes , this is a somewhat unusual film for its genre . Two fun hours . I recommend this to any fan of British humor and , to a lesser degree , romantic comedies .
449781	2093818	228786	7.0	A good movie that could have been great , had it just picked a genre and sticked to it	When I sat down to watch this movie , I knew it was gonna be a thriller . Unfortunately , the film itself didn't seem to know this , and kept jumping between genres . I don't know who is to blame , the director , the scriptwriter , or someone else , but someone obviously didn't realize the importance of picking one ( or two , if you can't pick just one ) genre and sticked to that . Instead , what we have is a movie that is primarily a thriller , but has parts of action , horror , and a few sub-genres . . . there was even a scene of martial arts action ; who in their right mind puts martial arts in a thriller ? Apart from the problem of not settling on one genre , the film is pretty good . The mystery was quite good , though I'm not sure I entirely understood it . The thriller portions of the film were well-done , and the film has good atmosphere at a few points . The film has some creepy , disturbing and downright nasty scenes involving corpses and body parts . The cinematography was pretty good , but nothing too memorable . One mistake the filmmakers made was making just about every member of the French police force seem like a retard ; obviously done for comic relief , but done wrong and pushed too far . In the end , it's pathetic , and actually annoying to watch , rather than entertaining . If they wanted comic relief , they should have implemented it through dialog . Fortunately , though , there aren't too many scenes of these failed attempts at comedy , so it's easily forgiven . The humor that there was , the parts of it that work , were more often than not good , and I liked the relationship between the two main characters , which made for much better , and more entertaining , comic relief . The last problem the film has , is what I like to call the " Hollywood Syndrome " ; the last half hour or so being painfully predictable , and the very end being so awfully " happy ending " - like that it almost takes the enjoyment out of the pretty good film you've just watched . However , all in all , if you can ignore the shortcomings of the film , it actually makes for a good watch , if you can take the violence and you like a good mystery . A final note ; as the film is French , not English ( or American , for that matter ) the dialog is all in French . My French being crappy , pardon my French ( sorry , bad pun ) , I saw this with subtitles ( not that I had much choice , as I saw it on TV , but anyway ) , so if you don't understand French , you might wanna make sure that the version you're seeing is subtitled ( I've heard that there is an English-dubbed version , and that it's awful ) , in order for you to actually follow what's going on in the film . OK , one final note ( yeah , I lied before . Sue me ) ; while watching this , I realized that Jean Reno actually sounds cooler when speaking French than when speaking English . I recommend this to anyone who can stand the violence ( which is somewhat considerable and at times sadistic and gruesome ) , and who enjoys a good thriller-mystery . An all-round good mystery-thriller , with good acting and good production values .
450916	2093818	234215	7.0	This did have a lot to live up to	This is based on the Ultimate 10-Disc Set . This one suffers from several things , noticeably . The first shares traits with the original Star Wars . . . the main one in this comparison being that they were both the beginning of a trilogy , whilst being fully able to be taken as the entire story . Lucas managed to complete his series of three to the satisfaction of viewers . . . in part because all had been set up in the initial movie , things didn't get too much more complex and difficult to understand with the following two ( don't get me wrong , I find Episodes IV and V to be excellent ) . The Wachowski brothers did not . This adds layers and facets that the one before it did not . . . quite possibly simply because it was already so packed , and it still pulled that off . Thus , the attempt here is to successfully integrate these new aspects , as well as top that one . And this entire epic tale was to be closed in less than four and a half combined hours . There was not enough time and the high expectations may not exactly have helped . Where the philosophy was smooth and neither stuck out nor came off as pretentious when this franchise began , it sadly moves in the wrong direction here . Similarly , the dialog just does not reach the same level , and there are downright poor lines herein . Some of the humor does work , other bits come off as being silly . The pacing is not spot-on , but uneven . The plot is good , and develops reasonably . The acting still tends to be in the positive end of the spectrum . The action is still mind-blowing , and it does expand the scope . . . I do not believe there has ever been anything like the freeway scene before , or that thus far , a similar one has been done . The cinematography is still stunning , and the inspiration and mix still astound . There are memorable sequences , and the choreography and execution for martial arts and shootouts alike are excellent . The music and sound are amazing . Editing is sharp . The effects are incredible . The new cast-members aren't bad at all . To anyone wondering . . . no , you do not " need " to watch The Animatrix , nor play Enter the Matrix . Yes , they tell you more , but one can appreciate and " get " all the films without those . What they do is put things in perspective and give more details on certain events and characters , nothing that is required . The ideas and food for thought of this are interesting , it is the presentation that is bothersome . There is moderately strong language , in relatively mild amounts . There is next to no nudity , but sexuality is present once , and very obviously hinted at , as well . This comes with a text introduction ( the same one as on the others ) , by the writer-directors , to the commentary tracks : One with philosophers who enjoyed these , Dr . Cornel West & Ken Wilder , and one of critics who didn't care for them , Todd McCarthy , John Powers & David Thompson . They are worth listening to . The double DVD holds well-done featurettes . I recommend this to fans of the concept and / or science fiction . Just be aware that this isn't as great .
450933	2093818	119807	7.0	Somehow , this works even if you don't really like the humor	I've never really liked Steve Oedekerk . I want to give his movies a chance , but I'm not very happy with the fate and state of the second Ace Ventura film and I just am not into his humor . I've never really understood why physical violence , repetition and " silly " / stupid humor was funny . I remember watching this some years back , and , heck , I don't know , something in me just wanted to watch it again . I could remember the plot ( well , the basics of it ) and the majority of the jokes I could either remember in detail or they didn't seem familiar at all ( meaning , I most likely didn't find them funny the first time I watched it ) . I believe the number of times I laughed while watching this could be counted on the hand of an overeager and careless teenager right after he's celebrated New Year's Eve or the 4th of July . And that might even be both viewings put together . But somehow . . . I never really wanted the movie to end . I never felt remotely like turning it off and I would be lying if I claimed to have been bored by it . The plot , sure , it's simple . . . but it works . It develops nicely , too , and , as stereotypical and ludicrous as these characters were . . . I kid you not , I felt for them . Oedekerk treads the fine line between melodrama and discreet character development masterfully . The dialog has moments of grandeur . The acting is credible . As lame as the following may sound . . . it is a pleasure to watch Oedekerk himself , in his little role , just getting wacky and zany . The man is clearly enjoying himself , and it's hard not to smile at , and not in a cruel way ( though that may be what he intended ) . And could the movie possibly feature a better soundtrack ? I don't think there was a single song that I didn't care for or thought didn't fit ( and they all do seem to be songs . . . complete with lyrics . . . unusual , but it works , and it works great ) . To anyone not into the genre , I must warn you . . . some of it is , indeed , rap . It's not really dominating , though , and it's not that much of the music , anyway . Lawrence and Robbins have pretty good chemistry together . . . as buddy-comedy pairings go , this is one of the luckier ones . And to anyone else out there who have noticed John C . McGinley's name on the cast list and are hoping that he plays something similar to Dr . Cox . . . I can assure you , while he doesn't have an awful lot of screen-time , he does , in fact , portray a character possessing many of the same characteristics ( well , let's be honest , he hardly ever plays something in the other end of the spectrum , anyhow . . . not that I mind , mind . . . you ) . All in all . . . I cannot , for the life of me , explain why , but this movie entertained me . I didn't laugh , but I never felt like I was wasting my time , either . Somehow , this just works , even if you don't care for the humor contained within . Oedekerk , you've shown a new side of yourself . I shall seek out more of your work to see if this was a lucky coincidence . . . or if you truly have that talent . I recommend this film . . . I don't know , I guess mainly to fans of Mr . Oedekerk , and possibly the actors Robbins , Lawrence and McGinley .
450076	2093818	121766	7.0	The easiest to tolerate ?	" I can't watch anymore " . I understand you , but that really refers more to the entire Prequel Trilogy . When you put a line like that in . . . I mean , just look at the title of Intolerable Cruelty , and the tag of The Matrix Revolutions . But yes , my summary refers to the most recent three . And it does , indeed , not take into account how frenetic this can be . There's a healthy dose of action , and some of it does work . . . but much is overdone . The light-saber stuff varies , but some bits , with how casual its participants are , while the intent surely was to make it look cool , it just takes away the sense of danger , and the thrill and excitement go with it . At times , the fights are done in medium shots , which doesn't help any . The battle scenes , for really the only time in any of these movies , lack any kind of sense of progression , you can never tell who's winning , and it renders them little more than visual spectacles . The effects are amazing , I do give them that . Do the cameos add , or merely detract ? The dialog ( though it does have moments ) and acting ( come on , Hayden , you're better elsewhere . . . so's essentially everyone else ) still need work . More holes in the overall canon exist from what is seen and heard in this . This does try to , and to some extent , succeeds in , bridging the gap . The efforts do range between abruptly sudden and too slow , but the middle is reached at least for portions . It's dark in tone , and this is fairly well-achieved . My conclusion after having viewed the entire PT in succession is that Lucas started where it would have been fine to end . . . Phantom Menace feels classic , and to me , it scores the highest marks as far as being entertaining goes . After that , it just went further and further , and the emotion and how memorable they were declined at the same rate . I imagine few will argue that George has too many yes-men around him , or for that matter that he clearly did not have the entire series in his mind whilst working on any one of the individual films . I would like to point out that I am neither a disgruntled fan nor someone who grew up with the OT and / or experienced a lot of hype for these . The DVD has over a dozen featurettes ( of varying length ) , trailers , TV-spots , cut out material and a commentary track . I recommend this to those who wish to take in all of the canon cinema releases .
450859	2093818	151137	7.0	Not the greatest war movie , but a good movie , and a somewhat true-to-facts portrayal of Jeanne d'Arc	Luc Besson usually makes spectacular movies ; Leon , The Fifth Element , etc . Joan of Arc is no exception . It details the life of Jeanne , the maiden of Lorraine , who in and around the year 1431 , helped France defeat England , and win a war that has lasted for almost an entire century . The plot is great , and it has a very good pace . I am almost never bored when watching this film , despite the fact that it's fairly long ( about two and a half hours long ) , and I've seen it at least half a dozen times . What I've found to be great about the film is the re-watchable quality it has ; I've seen it many times , yet I haven't grown tired of it . Up to the very end , it always has a scene or two that you can look forward to , either because it's exceptionally well done , has very good cinematography , has great acting and / or dialog , or every one of those qualities . The acting is great . Every single actor gives a great performance , even the child actors were convincing . The performances that impressed me the most , however , were those of Milla Jovovich and Dustin Hoffman , as Jeanne and her conscience , respectively . They never cease to amaze me . The characters were well-written and credible . I particularly liked the way Jeanne was written as having a very notable temper and being very decisive . I also very much enjoyed the various supporting characters , the best being La Hire and The Conscience . I liked the way the film seems to question Jeanne's sanity ; whereas most believe that she was in fact , sent by God , this film sits down and asks the question , if she really was , or if the signs and miracles weren't all in her head , and caused by everyone wanting to believe it . The very last scenes especially puts doubt in the viewer . It was quite a gutsy move by Besson , to question his own country's hero . I will admit , the film does really make it seem more like she is crazy rather than sent by God , but it doesn't feel like Besson is pushing his view onto us , telling us that that's the way it was ; it feels more like he tries to make us question it . The action and the war scenes were very well done , very chaotic and disturbing , very intense and bloody . This isn't the best war movie ever made , nor is it the most factually accurate ; it might not even be the best retelling of the legend of Jeanne d'Arc . But I have found it to be a thoroughly enjoyable , well-acted , well-choreographed , well-done film that makes you think . And that's good enough for me . Several scenes are quite memorable , as are some of the lines . All in all , a very enjoyable war-drama , with an authentic story and some well-done battle sequences . I recommend it to fans of the actors , of Luc Besson's other work and of war movies / dramas in general . Just don't expect a full-out war movie ; it's two hours and thirty minutes long , and I don't think more than forty-five minutes in total are spent fighting .
450154	2093818	304415	7.0	Important , if not overly impressive film	I remember when this hit theaters . I don't remember exactly why I didn't I go for it back then ? maybe I thought it was something else . In any event , I knew that I had to watch it when the TV ads came on for its airing here , on Danish TV . The part of the advertisements that ran that best summarizes it is the exchange between the film's two Julia's ; upon being asked by Roberts what she wants to do with her life , Stiles replies that she will marry soon . Roberts further asks " and then ? " , to which Stiles , clearly very surprised at the query , simply replies " then I'll be married . " That was all a girl or woman could aspire to , back then . Being married . Taking care of their husband and children , to directly quote a character in the film . Far be it from me to suggest that we should completely ignore tradition ? roots are important , and we can learn from the past ? but to put a certain role upon every person of a certain gender is hardly fair or constructive . What makes this film work is that it shows you both sides of the argument . Sure , it clearly takes a stance , but anyone competent enough to look past the manipulative nature of certain films will get a reasonably full perspective . And while Roberts is clearly the " hero " of the story , she is not flawless , nor does she always win . The plot is fair , and develops nicely throughout . The pacing is decent . The acting ranges , but is all-round acceptable . This won't break any ground , especially not through its technical aspects , but it will hopefully inspire some thought . I recommend this to any fans of the people involved in making it , and anyone into having views challenged ? their own or those of their contemporaries .
449949	2093818	108399	7.0	Very pulpy . . . perhaps too pulpy for my tastes	I'm not sure what would have made this film more appealing to me . . . maybe Tarantino should have directed it . . . maybe someone other than Christian Slater should have played the lead role . . . maybe there should have been fewer deaths . . . maybe the film should have been shorter . As is , the film just didn't interest me all that much , and I only really paid attention to the first few and the last few scenes . The plot never really got my interest , though I thought the love story between the two leads was surprisingly good . The pacing seems much too slow and jolted for a Tarantino film ( honestly , either Tarantino should have been allowed to direct it or Scott should have written his own script ) . The acting ranges , but most of it is good . Slater is acceptable , but a good actor he is not . His performance is passable at best , and him being the leading man definitely took a lot out of the experience for me . The film never really seemed to take off or go anywhere . . . and not long into the movie , it was just waiting for the next guy to get killed . The dialog is typical Tarantino , meaning somewhat roundabout , but usually funny and / or insightful . The humor is pretty good , and also fairly typical Tarantino ( though it too would have benefited from Tarantino directing the film ) . To make it perfectly clear ; the film is clearly and obviously and in many , many ways a Tarantino film . His unique and easily recognizable style is here , just like in Reservoir Dogs , both volumes of Kill Bill , Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown . However , this is , by definition , not a Tarantino film . He didn't direct it , and believe me , it shows . Scott just doesn't " get " Tarantino's style , and messes up so many of his trademarks ( most notably , he removes the important non-linear time-line ) and references , stuff that Tarantino never would have blown , not in a million years ( here I feel it is necessary to point out that I am not a fan of Tarantino's ) . Yes , that's what really brings this film down ; another director trying to shoot a story that Tarantino has put together , and who completely misses the boat . Just for the record , an example of a director's perfect use of a Tarantino script is the Robert Rodriguez / Quentin Tarantino collaboration From Dusk Till Dawn . Go see that one before even thinking about this one . I recommend this film to Tarantino / pulp fans . Give it a chance . Just don't expect a Tarantino film .
450524	2093818	372784	8.0	Off to a great start	At a time when it was thought that this movie franchise was beyond any possible rescue , this was put together . What I got when I sat down in the theater , over three years ago , and the lights were turned off was a very pleasant , and rather welcome surprise . First off , let me make it clear that Nolan takes appropriate time introducing and building up before the superhero aspect turns up at all . A lot of this is spent on back-story , Bruce's as well as that of other important characters . With that said , my hat's off to Christopher . . . I'm not sure any other director has the same understanding of what makes Bruce Wayne and his alter ego tick . The motivation , the determination , terrifying his enemies . . . perfect . The way bats ( the animal ) are used in this is magnificent . Whenever Batman attacks henchmen , we see it from their angle . . . not his . This is fantastic , and works really well . The other action scenes , however , the fighting and such , at their worst , do arguably reveal that the director is not used to this kind of film ; most of the shots are at medium range , and about half of them are dark . To put it bluntly : There are points where you can't see a thing . Another thing that bothered me was that this seems too eager regarding some of the surprises . At least once or twice , I sat waiting for something I knew would come , to happen . Apart from those somewhat minor complaints , this feature is excellent . The plot is well thought-out and it pays off . The dialog is brilliant . The humor is good , almost every single line that tries to be clever succeeds . The performances are top-notch , all-round . Neeson is marvelous , as are Bale , Caine and Oldman . Holmes is above average . The direction is very stylish , and this bears resemblance to a psychological thriller . It would have been nice , though , if they went for more complexity than " fear " seeming to be the one thing they focus on . The attempt to make the story and villains seem more realistic and believable went well . I wasn't a huge fan of the new Batmobile when I first saw it in previews , but . . . just wait until you see it . In fact , there's a car-chase involving it that almost alone is worth watching this for . The equipment and weapons are easier to look at when it's explained as something that very well could exist in the real world . I especially liked the idea behind Scarecrow . I won't reveal it here . Also , I would like to give Mr . N two thumbs up on his decision to use primarily practical effects , with little to no CGI . It looks better and is enormously credible . The atmosphere is expertly achieved . As the very last thing : This really isn't a superhero flick . It's a moral tale of a man and his fight for either vengeance or justice . He wears the suit for a reason . There is a little moderately strong language , no sexuality and material dealing with drugs . I recommend this to any fan of the comics , any of the actors and / or any of the genres . Do be sure to know what to expect from it . This is not colorful , and definitely not campy . It's dark , brooding and bleak . Fits like a glove .
450682	2093818	340398	8.0	Great action . . . about as good as Ambush	After watching all of the The Hire BMW commercials , I'm still considering the first , Ambush , my favorite . But I must say , this one comes damn close . It has great action , a pretty good plot and very good acting by all involved . The cameos by Ray Liotta and Robert Patrick are a nice touch . The only thing I didn't like in this was the twist . . . when we find out what's inside the suitcase . That is a little lame . . . and overly ' good guy ' , I think . Apart from that , though , the commercial is very cool and intense . I like the way the story was told , jumping a bit back and forth in time , throughout the entire thing . . . that worked exceptionally well . I haven't seen any other films by Joe Carnahan , but if any of them are as action-packed and intense as this one , I might have to check out some of his other work . While I can't say too much about his acting talent in general , I think Don Cheadle did a pretty good job in this . Clive Owen is , as usual , great as The Driver . F . Murray Abraham is charismatic as always . While this is not the best of the commercials , it is very good , and definitely worth watching . I recommend it to fans of the commercials and action films .
450943	2093818	175880	8.0	Heavy-handed and slow , but not without its moments and definitely interesting	When George C . Scott was approached for a part in this film and shown the script , he exclaimed " The language is terrible . " I disagree . The language is real . The dialog is true-to-life . We don't , or , very rarely , at least , always say the right thing , and we often repeat ourselves and say stupid , pointless things when making a point or being in a situation we can't control . Contrary to what you might think , this doesn't mean that the dialog is tedious . It may take some getting used to , but you realize that it is much better than typical Hollywood dialog . . . because words don't convey our emotions the same way body-language and behavior does . Writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson obviously knew that , and used it in this film . I haven't seen any of his other work , but I will . Now , this film is character-driven , and that is its biggest strength , and its main reason for failing in some parts . It's a long film , but it's not overlong ( maybe a little in the end , but the first two hours are hardly ever boring ) . It's a film with non-Hollywood dialog , but this is just something to get used to . The problem lies undeniably in the character-driven nature of the film . Some big films have many , many characters . This one , however , has many , many main characters . This means that there are about 15 people that you have to remember , learn of , and follow throughout the three-hour run-time of this film . This means that you probably won't be able to pick up everything on the first viewing , and , more importantly , there will most likely be at least one character that you dislike , maybe even strongly . This makes every scene with them hard to sit through , and their very presence in the movie can make you annoyed with it . For me , it was Jim Kurring . He was just so pitifully annoying and unbearable . He can't tolerate ' bad language ' , he has the most annoying blind faith , and he just seems generally retarded . What's worse is his narration and his lack of charm or charisma . He's the guy you avoid in real life , but act nice around because you don't want him to know how badly you hate him . The film has some very heavy-handed symbolism and some seemingly pointless scenes , that could easily have been written out or cut with no real effect on the film . I enjoyed the first two thirds considerably more than the last . The scenes near the end . . . I won't put what happens here , but it just seemed pointless and stupid . The film didn't seem to have a real ending . . . nothing is really resolved . No questions answered , no solutions given . It's basically just a story about all of these people , and that's it . I don't know if I expected the ending of the film to hold some major surprise ( well , that it did , I admit ) or an explanation , but it just seemed kind of pointless in the end . " But it did happen . " Yes , but why ? Are we supposed to take some moral lesson out of all of this , or is it just a study of different persons and strange coincidences ? What makes a magnificent drama , I think , is if it offers a commentary on something that we all know , or pushes through an important point . . . One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has the beautiful message of freedom and fighting for it , Citizen Kane shows how important love is to any man . . . but what does this movie show ? What message is it trying to convey ? I can't seem to pin-point it . Maybe I need to think more about the film . . . maybe there is none . That doesn't make it a bad drama , but it prevents it from being a truly remarkable one , I think . The plot is very good and well-written . The pacing is good , at least for the first two hours . . . after that , it seemed to slide a little downwards . The acting is flawless . Absolutely flawless . From the biggest star to the least seen extra . . . not one performance was unsatisfactory . Not even the child actors . The characters are well-written and credible . All in all , a very good drama , but not a perfect one and not as impressive as some shorter films . I recommend it to fans of dramas , but I will say that it takes some effort from the viewer to enjoy and it is kind of an acquired taste . It's also a bit slow , after the first two hours .
450323	2093818	384783	8.0	Even more videos by Al , and this time . . . there're specials !	Since Al hadn't made the last of his videos by ' 96 , it made sense to release this , an updated compilation music video DVD , and this time , they put some special features on , as well . Two of these are more things you can watch . . . a live performance of Another One Rides The Bus on something called The Tomorrow Show , from 1981 , where Al has the music side ( in addition to himself on the accordion ) helped by his partner , Jon Schwartz playing , among other things , a piece of luggage ( it'll make sense when you see it . . . no , seriously , it will ) , and some select clips of The Weird Al Show ( which are amusing and very " Al " ) , including the intro ( which is really good ) . In total , these come to about eight minutes , bringing the full running time of this DVD up to one hour and about 33 minutes . Also featured is a photo gallery with production stills of the various videos . Lastly , there are subtitles for all of the viewable material ( lyrics whenever something is sung ) , and while these may not get everything right ( I can't for sure tell if they do or not ) , they're good to have and a great help for following the songs ( and hey , if you don't like them , they can be turned off , ah , the wonder of the medium of DVD ) . Of course , there are also the three new videos from the master of absurd comedy and parody-making ; Bob , which will have you marveled at how many palindromes Al could find and make work ( to spoof the incomprehensible singing of Bob Dylan ) , It's All About The Pentiums , Baby ( featuring Drew Carey , no less , presumably due to being connected to sitting in a cubicle ) , which is a rather skillful re-writing of It's All About The Benjamins , Baby , to make P . Diddy's song be about computers rather than making money , and finally , The Saga Begins , which retells the story of Star Wars : Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace , in a fairly straight-forward manner . The flow of the videos isn't bad . The menus are set up well , and it's easy to find your way around , though the video selection could perhaps be better , it's too easy get lost in . All in all , definitely worth owning for any fan of Weird Al . If it's this or ' Weird Al Yankovic : The Videos , for the same price , I'd advise you to choose this . I recommend this to any fan of Weird Al Yankovic and / or parody songs / videos .
450511	2093818	256215	8.0	A great made-for-TV crime-thriller	I did have my doubts when I sat down to see this , as I have had nothing but bad luck with made-for-TV crime-thriller , as they are usually high on cliches and have very bad , totally predictable plots . I was pleasantly surprised to see so much humor and style in a TV-movie . It does have some cliches , but the film definitely makes up for it by being incredibly well-made , at least for a TV-movie . Though the plot is a little predictable , it has a good amount of twists and it keeps your interest throughout the entire run-time ; I certainly never lost interest in it , or got bored by it . The plot is good , a little predictable , but never dull . The acting is pretty good , most of the actors pull off great performances . The characters are well-written and credible . I don't know if this film is based on a true story , it had a sort of authentic ' feel ' to it . I like the way the director did the flashback sequences , his use of slow-motion , especially near the end . The humor of the film was also great ; the cops had a believable ' tough guy ' humor . All in all , the film is definitely one of the best of the made-for-TV crime-thrillers I've seen . I recommend it to fans of crime-thrillers , and murder mysteries .
450048	2093818	32455	8.0	Truly timeless	I don't know how old I was when I first watched this , but I may very well have been too young to comprehend how long ago it was made . . . much less how old some of the score is . I still recognize some of it from watching it more than a decade ago , and probably further back still . Putting images to classical music is a great way to get those of us ( yup , guilty as charged ) who just wouldn't sit down to listen to something like that under normal circumstances to experience it . Cartoons have aged remarkably well ( not just this , in general ) . . . what needs to , and / or is meant to , look imposing still does ( I won't blow what they are , for anyone who hasn't seen this . . . and those who have may very well know exactly what I'm referring to ) , and the whole thing still works , almost 70 years after it was originally released . Little sound is added . . . the visuals are scored almost entirely with the performances of the orchestral classics , the way the animation brings the well-known composed pieces to life . Drawing styles vary , and some segments are naturalistic , others almost psychedelic . Colors are vivid , and sometimes underplayed . Segments are briefly introduced by a speaker . There is story progression in at least some of the bits . I recommend this to anyone who doesn't object to two hours of animated visuals to go with some of the greatest score ever composed .
450229	2093818	43456	8.0	Excellent sci-fi film . . . the one true flaw is the heavy-handed , preachy presentation of its moral	I had heard about this film a number of times before I got to watch it . It's been lauded as one of the best science fiction movies ever , and there are numerous references to it in other movies and on TV . I definitely understand its popularity now . The plot is interesting and develops nicely throughout . The pacing is pretty much solid all the way , I was never bored . The effects hold up remarkably well , and are seldom anything less than completely convincing . The writing is quite good , with credible characters and events ( considering the genre , obviously ) ; it did , however , stand out how one character seems to disappear for the final act with no explanation . The acting is fine ; it doesn't soar to Oscar-winning heights ( nor does it drop to the point where it's embarrassing ) , but it worked well for the film . I thought that the event which the title refers to held a great point , and worked well as satire and social commentary . The music has the disadvantage of being produced at a time where music for sci-fi alien / UFO stuff was what by any standard today is considered corny ; this piece deserves a much more fitting score , but if you can overlook that ( which I had little trouble doing ) , it's still a highly enjoyable movie . The film plays much more seriously than many sci-fi films ( particularly of the period , and for dealing with UFOs ) , and works really well as such . The one thing that brings down the overall quality is the way the moral of the story is presented . . . I realize that movies did occasionally spoon-feed their points around this time ( Scarface of ' 32 being a prime example thereof , although this film certainly isn't as bad as that ) , but it's difficult to listen to the point being presented , valid as it arguably may be , when it's being preached to us . Still , this is a fine piece of science fiction , and should be experienced by any and all fans of such . I recommend this to any fan of the people involved in making it as well as the genre of sci-fi .
450785	2093818	424205	8.0	Moving	I was looking forward to finding out how this historical yet forgotten event would be put to film , and how accurately it would be depicted . I am not disappointed . This evokes emotion without ever slipping into sentimentality or sap . It personalizes without robbing the true occurrence of attention . There is focus put on certain characters ( all of which are quite well-written ) , but never to the point of such being lost on what really happened . The plot is great , and develops well . Some liberties are taken with the story , and they are not all justified , but the core is kept intact , and this manages to both tell what happened and make us feel and care about it . The overdubbed singing could have been subjected to better synchronization , but there is little to any criticisms directed at the acting itself . The same goes for the production value . The technical aspects of this are excellent , as well . The cinematography and editing are just about flawless . Pacing is rather good . Writing and directing are commendable . All three sides each speak the actual languages , adding to the already well-established sense of realism . I recommend this to anyone interested in the period , and the specific situation in particular .
449849	2093818	250081	8.0	An unpleasant , unsettling , and most importantly , necessary film	After reading about Palindromes and finding myself oddly attracted to the subject matter of several of Todd Solondz's features , I bought this film . It would seem that it has a reputation as being his worst work to date ( at least as far as theatrically released movies go ) . . . I must say , if the rest of what he's done is this powerful , I will have to keep my eyes open for it . You seldom see movies that are this unpleasant . There are films that are far , far harder to watch . . . but this is still not one you put on to enjoy yourself . As many other viewers , I didn't care much for the first half ( well , part . . . it's a third of the projects full length , with a running time of about 25 minutes ) , " Fiction " . I felt I had gained little after it was over , though I will say that the concept and themes explored are quite interesting . " Non-Fiction " proved to be far more worth-while , in my opinion . The writing and direction is excellent in both . The pacing works well . . . I was never bored , and while it wasn't exactly a " good " time , it moved along as it should , never really too slow or too fast . The characters were incredible . . . the sheer amount of development , through so little time spent on each . . . that's talent . As its title indicates , Storytelling goes into different methods of telling a story . . . and displays some of the most impressive storytelling that I've seen to date . There is some humor , but it's quite black , and throughout the film , I was unsure of whether I should laugh out loud . . . or cry my eyes out . The film is strongly satirical , very direct and seemingly almost aggressively anti-PC . Dealing with several subjects of taboo , Solondz pulls few punches , if any . Certainly not a film for everyone . Both parts seem to end somewhat abruptly , but that may be intentional . I will say that my rating would almost certainly have been higher had the first part been improved upon . . . or removed entirely . It's difficult to say who I'd recommend this to . . . cynics or realists with a strong threshold for the some of the ugliest sides of human nature , I suppose . From what I understand , though , it's less provocative than the other film of Todd Solondz .
450907	2093818	416716	8.0	Interesting , entertaining , informational . . . and thorough without being boring	This special starts before the original Star Wars , and after introducing Lucas and setting the scene for the time period , it takes us through the entire trilogy , with clips , interviews and behind the scenes footage en masse ( I won't throw on the ever-ambiguous " and more " that is a common favorite to throw on DVD covers and the likes . . . believe me , if they've got something good to sell you , they know it , and they won't hesitate to tell you , " more " is like " interactive menus " . . . it makes nothing out of the ordinary sound like a real treat ) . Each main member of the cast , including Kenny Baker ( R2D2 ) , and Anthony Daniels ( C3PO ) - who sounds a lot like his character even when he's just speaking normally - and Peter Mayhew ( Chewbacca ) . It has a good pace throughout , the version I watched was 90 minutes , and it never grew stale . It is edited expertly throughout . There is a solid flow to the documentary . It holds a lot of information , and the right amount of time is spent on it . The fun factor of this is achieved nicely , and without overshadowing what it is presenting . About the only person not brought in for an interview is David Prowse , who I suppose may still hold a grudge over not being told that they weren't going to use his voice ( and if he knew that they were going to add in footage of Vader where his voice was still the one heard , in this special ( which . . . let's just say , doesn't exactly sound as powerful and terrifying as that of James Earl Jones , who is also interviewed in this ) . . . well , he might have stayed away for that reason , I know I would ) . There is perhaps a bit of patting on the back going on , as the special mentions just how many nominations and wins the films got , and how important it was , and so on and so forth , but this doesn't keep it from being worth watching . I recommend this to any fan of the original trilogy . Heck , the anecdotes alone almost make the hour and a half worth it .
450847	2093818	1092058	8.0	Think	I don't particularly know anything about the writer / interviewer of this , and I watched this because someone else made me aware of its existence . Here , superstition is investigated , and science praised . Religion is not mentioned much at all beyond the very beginning , and I understand that it has already been explored in a prior effort by the same man who made this . Dawkins delves into the world of psychics , chakras and the like , and both undergoes treatments , readings and such , and talks with the spokespeople of them . He asks all the right questions , and comes across as quite respectful , considering his obviously differing opinion . He is notably less aggressive and overbearing than Michael Moore , who , I'm afraid , is really the only person I can think of to make comparisons to in this regard ( I openly admit to not watching that many of these ) . Rather than attacking with accusations , Richard debates intelligently , and presents the facts , from what I can tell , entirely without bias . He exposes tricks used by some of those who claim to see beyond . He puts into perspective . Even if I did disagree with what he is saying , I'd find it a feat to argue points so logical . What he believes can be proved , and does not require faith , as a stark contrast to a large portion of what he takes a close look at herein . He and his approach are not really condescending , either . I am not aware of multiple versions of this , but what I watched was two parts , each of about 45 minutes , so an hour and a half of highly informational and revealing documentary . It points out that while some of it is harmless , certain of the practices can be harmful , to varying degrees . The production values leave little to be desired . The tone is serious , without being heavy , and allowing some irony . I recommend this to anyone who do or wish to value the tested , and / or tend to meet the opposite with skepticism .
450803	2093818	416449	8.0	Stylized , adrenaline-filled awesomeness	Given that this was made so soon after Sin City , one cannot deny the possibility that a reason for making it was the popularity and widespread success of the aforementioned film . Both are based on comics of Frank Miller's . . . both are bloody , and packed with adrenaline and style . However , regardless of what may or may not have been in the minds of the producers , this movie is entertaining and fulfilling . Whilst not as well-rounded and perfectly executed as Sin City , it has plenty of action , cool shots and intensity to go around . I have not read the original comic book , so I cannot comment on how well this tells the story that Miller ( not the historians ; don't make the mistake of confusing this film for an actual account of events ! ) intended , but I can say that it pulls off the comic book feel pretty darn well . The visuals are simply stunning , and the movie is filled , just about to the very brink , with gorgeous designs and camera-work that amazes . The many boxes of text found in most comic books are translated to the medium of film with a narrator , and it works remarkably well . I was worried early on that the narrator would remain for all of the film . . . but I found it to not only mesh with the visuals but improve the overall experience . The music is part orchestrated score , and all fits exceptionally well . The pacing was flawless . The acting I found to be masterful for just about every part . The dialog varies , but the majority is good . The grandiose speeches and the serious tone of them is lightened pleasantly through occasional wit . The battles are massive , bad-ass and often quite bloody ( though there was less gore than I had expected . . . but I didn't mind ) . I would guess that big parts of the audience are comprised of people coming mainly for the battles , and I would say that most will leave the theater satisfied . The sequences of fighting are long , stylized , well-choreographed and wickedly cool . I found the rest of the movie to be interesting and engaging , and I wouldn't say that the fights are too long . One thing I really liked , and that got the movie and Frank Miller my respect , was the way the Spartan women were depicted : Strong , passionate and as full of courage and fortitude as the men . Whether or not this is historically accurate , I don't know , but that Miller and the movie would depict women that way is something I can only support and encourage . The movie was not perfect , however ; some shots were less spectacular than they could or should have been , and the last battle was perhaps a little disappointing . Still , this is a movie that I urge anyone who enjoys action , macho-ism and comic book style to watch . I strongly recommend this to any fan of comic books and any man into action .
450680	2093818	338768	8.0	Weird , bizarre , stylish , funny and intense	When you've got Gary Oldman wearing a red spandex and red lipstick in the role of the devil and James Brown , godfather of soul himself , complaining that the deal he got with the prince of darkness needs to be renegotiated because he's gotten too old to do splits , you know you've divided everyone who hears about it into two clearly marked , separated groups ; those who reject it and those who are intrigued . Those that belong in the latter category probably wind up watching this commercial , are once again divided into two groups ; those who love it and those who hate it . This is a clear-cut short film ; either you love it or you hate it . But that doesn't mean that it's bad . . . just that it's limited . I don't know exactly why , but I'm thankful it is . Maybe it's because that allowed it to be what it wanted to be , what it had to be . What is that , you ask ? Well , bizarre as hell , first of all . But also funny and stylish , not to mention quite intense . The race in the commercial is cool and exciting . The humor is very good . . . again , limited , but very good if you're into exactly that sort of thing . . . and I am . To an extent , at least . I laughed out loud at the ' twist ' in the end . The editing and cinematography is very stylish , very typically Tony Scott . I liked all of the puns and jokes , both those concerning the devil himself and those concerning James Brown . The acting is good . Clive Owen once again delivers a perfect performance . All in all , just a very weird and bizarre yet entertaining little commercial . I recommend it to any fan of the commercials or any of the actors . . . and possibly fans of Tony Scott .
450983	2093818	107818	8.0	Very powerful and beautiful drama	Let me start this off by making one thing absolutely clear ; I love law movies / court scene films , whatever you want to call them . This film reminded me that something that's even more important than entertaining court scenes in such a film , is an involving subject , to make you really feel that this case is important , crucial ; this film shows , once and for all , that a good story , an important subject , makes a good film if executed properly . This film has everything a good film needs ; an interesting and emotionally involving plot , a great cast and good cinematography . The plot is great , and it really makes you care about these characters , as they are likable and humane . The acting is all top-notch , especially by Tom Hanks , who gives a stellar performance as the homosexual AIDS-infected lawyer who is fired shortly after being promoted . Denzel Washington also gives a very good performance , portraying a homophobic lawyer . For the reasonably few scenes Antonio Banderas had , he also gave an excellent performance , as Tom's characters boyfriend . The characters are well-written , credible and most important of all , well-played . They are also very well-developed . The film has a very powerful message , and it delivers it well . It takes a very important subject , and shows us both sides of the argument , something reasonably few films do , and even fewer does it as good as this film . It treats the controversial subject with complete respect for both sides , both views . It's one of the most moving films I've ever seen . I recommend it to anyone interested in the subject , and pretty much all fans of serious dramas .
450377	2093818	117571	8.0	" It parodies , it scares , it satirizes . . . but that's not all ! "	After a period of endless slasher flicks , body-count films or " date movies " in the 80's , following the success of John Carpenter's classic ( which really isn't that much of one , there's hardly any blood ) , Halloween , of 1978 ( which I'm not claiming to be the first of its kind , I've heard of Black Christmas , which is said to also fit as such a film ) the genre died out somewhat . With Scream , it was rejuvenated somewhat ( at least for a few years ) , whether that was the intent or not . Love or hate that it had that effect . . . a respectful parody is such a rarity that it really ought to be commended , even if one doesn't care for the genre ( which is not to say that I don't , I may have only seen a few of the older ones , but I do seek out these films ) . This is half-way a parody of aforementioned sub-genre of horror , and equal parts an entry into it . The clichés are all here , intentionally so , and the film manages to entertain with both halves , and these mesh remarkably and admirably well . The nods , both the obvious and the subtle ones , are all good . The casting is impeccable . The music , both the score and the songs used , all top-notch . The acting is spot-on . The direction is excellent . . . character introduction , building of suspense , plot exposition and development , high marks , all the way . The script is well-done . The gore isn't as bad as it could be , not sure I'd really call it excessive , but the amount of blood is massive ( necessary for the spoofing ) . I've yet to see a recent movie of this kind which surpasses this one . Now , I'm surely not the first to point this out , but . . . why , exactly , were two full-on spoofs done after this , mainly using this for inspiration ? Never mind that neither are that good , and that that they hold no respect of the films they make fun of , but why do a send-up of a parody ? Wayans ' , come on , you can do . . . uh . . . well , still , don't do it again . " Shriek " team . . . well , you guys I don't know . But I digress . Frequently . I recommend this to any fan of parodies , horror films , and this particular kind of , well , both .
450566	2093818	285156	8.0	Very funny romantic comedy with crude humor	When I sat down to watch this , I expected to see a very average romantic comedy . I was pleasantly surprised ; this is one of the funniest teen comedies , and they came up with the great idea to combine crude humor with romantic comedy . I found it to be incredibly entertaining . The plot is very good , something any teenage guy can get into . The romantic parts aren't sappy or melodramatic in any way . They didn't seem out of place , either . The humor is very well-placed and mostly very funny . The characters , though half of them are stereotypes , are reasonably believable , and their actions are mostly in character . The actors do pretty good , considering most of them are unknowns . I liked how they managed to mix the crude comedy with the romantic comedy . It didn't seem forced or misplaced , in any way . Most fans of movies like American Pie or Road Trip will enjoy this ; however , fans of movies like Pretty Woman can probably also enjoy this movie , as it's a good mix of the two styles of movies . I'd recommend this to pretty much anyone who enjoyed one or more of the aforementioned films . It's worth watching .
450429	2093818	75002	8.0	Excellence continues in one of the most memorable entries	This is quite probably the most mentioned and possibly even watched of the movies concerning The Olsen Gang . The reason is one scene that defines the genius that is the writing and directing that is Bahs and Balling and the Olsen-Banden movies : The scene at the Danish Royal theater , featuring both the Overture of Elverhøj and one of this country's two National Anthems . Just about everyone reading this probably already knows exactly what the scene details . . . and anyone who doesn't should not simply read about it . It's one of the most unforgettable scenes in movie history , as far as comedy goes . For my money , anyone who considers them-self to possess a sense of humor should watch this scene at least once , and it doesn't hurt to see it more than that . I've watched this film so much that the VHS tape is worn . . . and I'm still enjoying the scene immensely and noticing amazing details about it . The plot is well-written and interesting . Including nobility was a marvelous idea , and they have a lot of fun with the class . The pacing is right on . . . I was never bored for a second . The adding of Fie , Børge's girlfriend is great , and Lene Brøndum did a lot with an amount of lines that could practically be counted on a hand . Her facial and body language do most of her acting , and it works great . Ernst Meyer provides a delightfully Franco-phile chef . Bent Mejding gives an incredible performance in the small role of the conductor . And Asbjørn Andersen deserves a mention . . . his last role , a cameo , and then one so fitting . It could be argued that he portrays himself . The humor is very sophisticated and retains the human touch that makes these films stand head and shoulders above the typical Danish comedy of this period ( whilst , admittedly , many of them are hilarious ) . There is a very small amount of cartoony humor in this one , but it's such a brief occurrence , it makes little difference one way or the other . The police are made fun of again , and this time , the granting of medals and such are added to the parody pile . There appears to be a common theme between this and the former . . . that of workers having outlived the time they grew up in and preferred to live in . " The good old days " are no more , so to speak . A bit in this that begs mention is when Poul Bundgaard and Ove Verner Hansen , who were both opera singers , both emit some rather deep vocal sounds . There's an added touch of irony when Bundgaard , being asked what it was he just did , replies " I don't know ! " whilst grinning nervously . A thoroughly well-written and highly entertaining film in a great series . I recommend this to any fan of the series and / or of Danish comedy in general . I'd suggest you make sure to have watched as many of the previous films as you can first , for important background and character knowledge .
449902	2093818	280928	8.0	Is black comedy , Gothic visuals and plenty of action and puzzles your thing ? Then this is the game for you	There once was a knight by the name of Daniel Fortesque , and when King Peregrin and the good-hearted people of Gallowmere were threatened by the evil sorcerer Zarok , he led the forces directly towards Zarok . It has been said that he single-handedly defeated Zarok , though mortally wounded . Unfortunately , that's not even remotely true . . . as a matter of fact , he fell by the very first arrow fired in the first charge . Now , 100 years after that battle , Zarok returns , turns the people of Gallowmere into his slaves and rises the dead from their graves to wreak havoc over the quiet little town . However , ( un ? ) fortunately for us , he also accidentally awakens Dan , and with all the other ( or should I say ' actual ' ) heroes dead ( not that the hopeful wanna-be hero is a shining example of pure vitality , himself ) , he's now our only hope . This is it , Daniel . . . you've been given a second chance to prove your worth ; don't blow it . The game has you controlling Dan , as he struggles to battle evil , save the people of Gallowmere and become a true hero ( especially in the eyes of the long dead heroes ( not all of which hold Sir Dan in equally high , or even particularly high , esteem ) , and the witty , sarcastic and utterly irreverent gargoyles ) . Now , apart from the twist of controlling a would-be hero ( rather than a typical hero returning to save the day ) , there's the added fun factor that what you're controlling isn't your everyday knight . . . he is , after all , dead . So you're running around as a skeleton wearing armor , with only one eye ( the arrow I mentioned before ? Got him right in the left eye . Ouch ) and without a jaw ( yup , that's what a century of decomposition will do to you ) . This is constantly part of the black humor ; for example , Dan can't speak clearly , since he's got no jaw ( or tongue , for that matter ) . When Dan smiles , it's really just the half row of teeth left forming what appears to be the upper part of a regular smile . Not really a pretty sight . Not at all . If you jump and Dan's head hits a surface , you'll hear a hollow sound , making it clear that his head is , indeed , empty . This may sound quite distasteful and downright disgusting to some , but I assure you , it's done in such a grotesque and direct manner , you can't help but laugh . If you're into black comedy , at least . The plot is highly original , and it moves along at a very good pace , delivering plenty of back-story ( about Dan , the other heroes , the myths and the town , etc . ) along the way . Graphics are great , you can barely tell that the game is seven years old by now . They looked good back then , and they still hold up very well . Level design is top notch , with few exceptions . One or two levels ( keeping in mind that this is out of about a dozen and a half ) just seem too easy and / or short , and you have to wonder how and why they made it into the final version of the game . One level has you fighting wave after wave of souped up enemies , dealing 5 times the damage they usually do . That just seems to scream " We've run out of ideas ! " at the top of its lungs . The control is great , very simple and easy to get into . Not too simple , but just simple enough . The humor is pure genius . The level and character design is incredibly detailed and imaginative . Throughout the game , you'll move through a graveyard , a mausoleum , a marsh , a crystal cave and even a ghost ship . You'll fight zombies , imps , demons , scarecrows and even hung men , still hanging from their gallows ( ! ) . That's what I call creativity . There are quite a few puzzles in the levels as well , and most of them are logical and fun to solve ( of course , there are a few obscure ones , as well ) . The weapons are entertaining to use , and quite a few are great fun , as well . For example , before you get any real weapons ( swords , daggers , projectile weapons and the like ) you only have . . . your arm . " Oh , " you say , " so you just hit them with your fists ? " Oh no , nothing that simple , not something that , to that extent , has been done before . Dan ( are you sitting down ? Good ) takes off one of his arms , and you can now direct him to either hit the enemies with it directly , or throw it at them , after which it will return to Sir Fortesque's other arm , a la a boomerang . Then there are longbows , which can fire flaming arrows ( which do , in fact , set the enemies ablaze . . . oh yeah ) . . . I'll leave you to discover the rest . Then there's the camera . . . this is a sensitive area for many of these games ( the linear third person console ones ) . However , Medieval succeeds in this area too ; the camera moves naturally , so that you can adjust the direction you're moving in . You can also rotate the camera yourself , if you're unsure of your surroundings ( with a few exceptions , and these are usually in areas where you don't need to rotate it ) . There's even a feature that has Dan treading carefully when he nears a hole , effectively warning the player , keeping you from falling down , as long as you don't run ( Walk , Don't Run , as the song lyric goes . . . especially if there are places to fall far down abound ) in places where you aren't sure of the terrain . The sound is superb . All high-quality sounds , fitting their purpose . The voice acting is of unusually high quality for a console game . Every voice fits and most lines work . The game-play is very entertaining , though I suppose there could be a higher rate of re-playability ( once you've beaten it , there's not really much reason to play again , unless you start over . . . save for collecting chalices for bonuses , of course , which are both entertaining and usually completely and entirely worth it to acquire for players of the game ) . I recommend this to any fan of Gothic style , black comedy , and fantasy , action and horror games .
450424	2093818	82843	8.0	An excellent first part of the end of the beloved characters	This is where the end is reached for the Olsen Gang . Kjeld and Yvonne are to celebrate their silver wedding . Egon announces right off the bat that he is not going back to jail . The end all be all to all Olsen Gang films ( yes , the ' 98 film hardly has any place in this series or even franchise at all ) . How best to make it count ? Collect every exceptional idea left , every coup , every joke and gag still to be done . . . and create a two-parter finale . This first part ends with a cliffhanger , followed by a brief advertisement for the next film , to ensure that people will watch it all . The plot is simply brilliant . The coups are among the most memorable , they are plentiful and they're all excellently executed . The pace is intense . There's constantly something going on , and the laughs are non-stop . The humor is amazing . From the Latin slogan ( in a delightful parody of the pompous slogan of Carlsberg , which was also written in Latin ) of the insurance company that translates into " In calamity we trust " to Yvonne's one-sided phone conversation with her never-seen sister , it's all sophisticated , accurate , human and hilarious . Bøffen pulls out two ( ! ) of his best death-traps , leading to several incredibly funny scenes . The character of Hallandsen , perfectly cast with Holger Juul Hansen as the executive on the verge of a nervous breakdown , begets several entertaining scenes , one featuring Tom McEwan as an immigrant cab driver . Tommy Kenter is born to play the small but funny role that he does . With an ending that leaves you on the edge of your seat and wanting more , all I can say is watch this , and be sure to have the next one handy . I recommend this to any fan of the series and Danish comedy in general , though having seen the previous films are a requirement to understand and enjoy it .
450020	2093818	317919	8.0	J . J . Abrams proves that his talent for TV can be translated fairly well to silver screen productions	My fiancée has introduced me to two grandiose shows recently , as well as a man of excellent writing and directing talent . . . the shows were Lost and Alias , and the man ( who I wasn't personally introduced to , mind you ) was J . J . Abrams . After thoroughly enjoying what I saw of both shows , I started paying close attention to what the man who created them was making now . . . and when I found that he was to direct the third part to this action-packed franchise which I've already seen two quite good action directors take a stab at - only to be disappointed by both - I was rather excited to see what he'd come up with . Let there be no doubt ; this movie is spectacular . It's huge . The trailer promised quite a lot , yet the film more than exceeded my expectations . True , it does run somewhat like a two-hour Alias episode . . . for better or for worse . . . and there are points where J . J . even channels Felicity ( ! ? ! ) , but it's still a good , fun ride ( if not without ideas , settings , situations and themes lifted from his aforementioned highly popular ( and deservedly so ) spy show ) . The plot has more unexpected twists and turns than a well-crafted maze . I never saw any of them coming , and I never felt cheated . None of them are cop-outs ; instead , they all work excellently to keep the story , not only moving , but also highly intense . The pacing is flawless ( save for the scenes of emo ) . The acting was good all-round . Cruise does fine . Hoffman , as expected , shines . Pegg was a great addition , he provides wonderful comic relief ( without being ridiculous or a cliché ) in his brief appearance ( and he's not exactly like Marshall . . . ) . Q and Rhys Meyers are nice additions , though their characters are kind of small ( and thin ) in the overall plot , compared to the ' real ' leads . I wouldn't say that they're underused , though , and Abrams does get some great stuff out of them ( using Q as the female put in alluring clothing ) . The characters are well-written , interesting and credible . The cast may suffer somewhat from Abrams being used to serial form , as there is not enough time to develop the characters . The writing is very , very good , apart from a few minor complaints . The humor is great . The dialog is thoroughly well-written and the chemistry is very much present . One of my favorite changes from the previous films was how personalized this was . . . sure , at first glance , that idea may seem like a cliché left over from poor action flicks of the 80's . . . but , believe you me , it works . It most definitely works . Giving the main character something to lose and then utilizing that to its fullest was an excellent idea , and completely new to a series ( the films , not the two TV series or the mid-60's movie ) which never was all that innovative . The score is great . The settings are spectacular . I won't ruin any of the scenes by telling you in which locales this movie takes place . However , I'm afraid this production is not all good , even for those of us who love Alias . I refer here to the cinematography . Yes , it's great , most definitely . . . but it doesn't look ' blockbuster ' . It doesn't look like a huge action epic with a massive budget of more than one hundred million dollars . . . rather , it looks like a TV production . Tight shots , intense cuts and hand-held camera dominates most of the action . More often than not , it's simply too confusing to even keep track of what happens , due to that . We miss the huge shots that let us know exactly how far there is between the good guys and the bad guys . There is actually one that starts out like that , but then it unfortunately zooms in ( nicely , but still ) on our hero , and again all we see is him and his immediate surroundings . All of this wouldn't be bad ( heck , it wouldn't be noticeable ) if this was , indeed , a TV production . . . but it's not . It's on a huge screen and people have paid good money to see stuff being blown up , bad guys getting whooped and big shootouts . . . you know , like the first two films . And that is what we get here . . . but too often , we just can't see that it is . We can't clearly tell what's going on , what the danger is , because of the near camera angles and the shots that leave no doubt in the viewers mind that this was shot as if it were a budgeted ( if pricey ) episode of a TV show . . . as J . J . is used to making . Many shots linger , with heavy movement ( panning as well as dolly trips ) in the camera replacing cuts and different angles . Again , this would be fine for a TV production where schedules are tight and you have less time to put together something big . . . but this isn't that , so it shouldn't look or feel like it . It should be more grand , epic . Too bad , Abrams . You came darn close . Still , this is a real treat for action flick fans , and a true accomplishment for a first-timer . It's a non-stop action-packed ride with plenty of laughs , spy stuff and more . By far my favorite installation as far as the movies go , and definitely one of the best of the newer action movies I've seen in a while . I recommend this to any fan of J . J . Abrams , Alias , action and spy flicks . Highly enjoyable .
450708	2093818	117407	8.0	Great , but could have been perfect had it not been for a few nagging points	Usually I'm not too fond of Danish cinema , since it's mostly derivative , dull and several hundred miles behind anything out of Hollywood during the same period . I decided to give this film a chance , though , as I'd heard so many good things about it . The film turned out to be better than I expected , in fact , it's great . There are just a few things that keep it from being perfect , that keep it from a perfect ten . First of all , we never get a good insight into why the main character is living this life . . . why he does what he does , and doesn't try to get out . It's clearly not a very healthy or pleasant way of making a living , so it would make it easier to sit through the film if we got some background info , some hint at why he chooses to keep ' pushing ' . He must've had a choice at one point , he must have been able to do something else with his life . We never get real insight as to why any of these people do what they do , and it's harder to sit through the film because of it . The cinematography is pretty good , considering that all of the camera-work is done on steady-cam , and there are fewer cuts than what we're used to from American cinema and mainstream films in general . There's a bit of a documentary feeling to this film because of that , which works well , but also makes the film seem slower at times , because there's often very little going on on-screen , and the camera either moves shakily or not at all , with only the good acting and the purposefully flat dialog to entertain the viewer . The score / soundtrack is pretty good , it fits nicely with the visuals , but at times it interferes with how natural , documentary-like the film is . The plot is good , and it evolves nicely throughout the film . The pacing is good , but around the end , it seemed to slow down a little too much . . . or maybe I was just tired with the documentary-like feeling of the entire film . I'm not entirely sure . The acting is mostly great , with one or two exceptions . The characters are sufficiently different and well-written , but they're not fleshed out enough , we don't understand them . The ending relied heavily upon understanding one characters actions , which we don't , which takes a good bit of the impact out of it . This film is very good , no doubt about it , but it just falls short in too many areas to be particularly re-watchable . It's worth one viewing , though , at least . Most people who either know or want to know about the Copenhagen underground should see this movie . I recommend this film to anyone who has an open mind about movies ( this is in no way mainstream ) and who enjoys gritty movies about the underground life of bigger cities . Be warned , though , it's not for the faint of the heart .
449867	2093818	75314	8.0	" Are you talking to me ? "	This movie is Scorsese's masterpiece ; it is a realistic portrayal of one mans reaction to seeing the very extreme nightlife of New York : pushers , psychos , whores , the list goes on . After seeing the movie 4-5 times , I still have to admit , there are some scenes which I don't fully understand , but I can still somewhat appreciate them . Robert DeNiro's acting is superb , as is Cybill Shepherds , and Jodie Fosters . All of them play their respective character convincingly . All of the minor characters are also interesting ; most of them are either a psycho , racist or just plain despicable , in some way or another . The transformation that DeNiro's character undertakes , from being a nice , gentle guy , to being a gun-toting self-help psycho , is amazing . It's got some slow scenes , but overall , I recommend this to anyone who likes a psychological drama , or any hardcore DeNiro fan . .
450938	2093818	211915	8.0	Charming . . . but I don't think I " got " it	After hearing so many wildly positive comments on this film , I decided to watch it . . . and when I found it on the bargain rack ( we aren't quite as clever with sales rhymes here in Denmark ) , I bought it . While the film captured me immediately with its unique style and the interesting , amusing story-telling , I found myself lost in the plot and the various actions of the characters . This was more noticeable in the latter half . Maybe it's a cultural difference , I don't know ( it may also be because this isn't meant to be understood or analyzed . . . something I have a tendency to subject all things in life to ) . The main reason I watched this ( positive feedback sounds good , but I've never been one to follow popular opinion ) is that I'm interested in the work of the director . . . Jean-Pierre Jeunet . So far , I've only seen Alien : Resurrection , but I've heard fabulous things about Delicatessen from a man whose opinion I hold a great deal of trust and respect for , in particular when it comes to movies . Jeunet has a peculiar style and an unusual ( occasionally bordering on the downright bizarre ) sense of humor . The film clearly doesn't take place in our world . . . the line between the real and that which is fantasy is blurred to the point in which it doesn't exist . Normally , I'm not interested in fairy tales ( and that may very well be the reason why I didn't get this film ) , but I found this quite charming . Everything is pretty and has a magical reason behind it . The comedy in the film is also extraordinary . . . it's so human , so light and delightful . Nothing crude , never offensive ( except for , I suppose , to puritans ) and somehow sweet . Like the naive little girl the film revolves around . I didn't quite agree with all the actions Ms . Poulain took in effort to uphold justice , but I am known to have ( or attempt to have ) a soft spot for most anyone , no matter their actions . As I hinted at before , the film is more . . . shall we say " free " than , for example , American films . The limits for what can be shown are looser , for better or for worse . Personally , I wasn't bothered by it , but if you think you might be , you may wish to skip this one . Most everyone who can watch this should , however . . . it is a welcome trip back to one's childhood , with the imaginative visuals and soft , light tone . Now , to anyone who doesn't speak French ( including yours truly ) , you must view this with subtitles ( I haven't heard of a dubbed version , and I personally find the idea of dubbing any movie appalling , unless it is a children's film and to be viewed only by children or people who haven't been blessed with the schooling necessary to be able to read ; you should show the filmmakers the respect of viewing their work as they intended it ) . Personally , being Danish ( I read once that we in this country have had just about everything subbed since some time in the early decades of the previous century ) , I'm not only entirely used to it , I have no problem with it ( though with films like this and Der Untergang ( and of course the works of Alejandro Amenábar ) , one is reminded to read them , as I cannot understand much of anything spoken ; quite different than the case is with all works in the English language , where I only read on occasion , and often simply to pick out mistakes made by the Danish-born ( and often linguistically incompetent ) translators ) . People from other countries may experience difficulty at getting used to it , however . The cinematography is stunning beyond words . Acting , editing , score . . . basically everything seemed flawless to me . Apart from not understanding much of what goes on for the last part of the film , I enjoyed this . I recommend it to anyone who can watch a fun , light film with a great imagination . And if nudity or sexual content bothers you , you may want to ask someone who knows you and the film to either detail it or to estimate whether or not you can handle it .
450798	2093818	372741	9.0	If I hadn't already been into film-making when I first watched this . . . I would have been before it was over	Robert Rodriguez has always impressed me . He works every job he can on his productions , and manages to make fun , cool and entertaining films for much less than they look like they cost , and while his writing may sometimes lack something , his movies are almost always worth watching . The fact that he was initially inspired by another film-making idol of mine ( who also works several jobs on his films , and makes marvelous films , arguably better ones than Rodriguez does , and does so for reasonably small sums of money , as well ) , John Carpenter , is simply icing on the cake . Where many directors will come off as self-absorbed and focused only on their own work , Rodriguez seems like the kind of guy who'd be your good buddy , and he serves so many excellent tips on the art of making motion pictures in this documentary ( which , in spite of its title , is actually longer than ten minutes . . . but I'm certainly not complaining , because they fly by ) , with " you can do this , too " in his tone . Whilst he was arguably fairly lucky on his first production , with many things working out very well for him , it is inspirational . . . and he passes on the torch to young hopefuls , like he himself once was , in this visual examination of how he pulled the thing off . Describing how he shoots , how him working most of the jobs creates opportunities that no regular film-crew has and how he managed to do scenes with dialog in spite of having to record all the sound separate from the actual film footage , he hands out countless tips worth gold in the hands of people as talented as he . I recommend this warmly to anyone interested in film-making , whether or not they plan to attempt to make something themselves . Just over ten minutes packed with experience from a film enthusiast who continues to bring marvelous films in under budget .
450757	2093818	87843	9.0	Excellent gangster film from a great film-maker	Sergio Leone is truly a magnificent director ; I hadn't realized the magnitude of his talent and abilities until I saw this great film . The film deals with a group of friends , who meet each other and start a partnership as children . They start out as criminals , and end up as criminals . The story is excellent , and the way it is told is great , and almost unique . The non-linear time-line in the film has been copied since this film was made , by other , mostly lesser talented , film-makers , such as Quentin Tarantino . I liked the way the first 30 minutes moved along , between present and immediate past , and then went all the way back to the very beginning of the story . The plot is excellent . The way it unfolds is truly spectacular , and while some might say that it is cheapened by the fact that we know pretty much how it'll end from the beginning , I really think it added to the greatness of the film and story . The plot also moves along at a great pace , it's never boring , despite the fact that the film is over three hours long , and it's not really an action film . I would say that it has it's share of action and suspense , though . There were sequences that rival action films that are considered as some of the best in newer times . There was at least three sequences were the suspense was nerve-wrecking , and the tension so thick you could cut it with a knife . The special effects were amazingly well-done , much better than most of the same time period . I'd have to say that effects-wise , it's probably the best movie of the 80's . The acting is spectacular . Even the child actors were amazing ; it was interesting to see Jennifer Connely , who's since become a star herself , play a role at such a young age , and playing it so well . The performances of the child actors are some of the best that I've ever seen in any movie , children or adults . All of the main characters , as well as most of the supporting characters were well-acted . The characters are well-written , credible , and rarely ever seemed out-of-character . The way gangster methods is portrayed is realistic and authentic , as is some of the plot . I would have to say that this film actually almost rivals The Godfather Part I as the best gangster film ever made . The only thing that bothered me was the plot twist at the end ; it really seemed wrong and unlikely to me , as well as my father , who's reading a lot about the mafia . We both agreed that it seemed weird and out of character . That one thing marred the ending for me , and brought this film down from a perfect score . Apart from the ending , the final plot twist , this film is great . I recommend this to fans of Sergio Leone , gangster films , and just great films in general . Fans of any of the actors might also find it interesting . Don't be thrown off by the long runtime ; it's worth every minute , up to the end ( the last 15 minutes bothered me , but nothing else ) .
450367	2093818	308956	9.0	Excellent cyberpunk-action-survival-horror-role-playing-game-hybrid	I just finished playing this through for the . . . what is it by now ? Fifth , sixth , maybe tenth ? I don't know , and very much to the game's credit , I don't care . It's such a giant , full experience that there's far too much for anyone to be able to take it all in on the first time playing it through . The game is immensely enjoyable . The story is brilliant and has so many details that you'll have to pay good attention to piece it together . The game-play is challenging and entertaining , not to mention open-ended . The game starts off giving you a quick taste of the different abilities you have in the game and then asks you to choose which group of abilities you'll focus most on in the game . From then on , you have to upgrade some of the abilities to your own liking . That ensures that no two people play the game the exact same way . . . in fact , the many times I've beaten it , I've yet to play through two even slightly similar play-throughs . . . I think that says something about just how open the game-play is . . . even more-so than Deus Ex , another excellent action / RPG hybrid ( and which I do , when everything is taken into account , consider to be the superior game ) , in which everything is neatly planned out . . . in this , the spawning ( for those not well versed in video-game lingo , this means " creating " ) of enemies is controlled by a randomizer ( I believe that you can turn this off , if you find it too challenging , as the game has a console and the manual tells you both how to access it and how to tell it to turn spawning off ) . The player can never entirely relax and let himself or herself think that all of the enemies are dead . . . not until he or she beats the game , anyway . The music of the game is consistently atmospheric and unsettling . . . you're constantly wondering if something is right behind the next corner . When you're attacked , it switches to a very cool rock score that fits the action perfectly . The sound and general atmosphere make for a thoroughly creepy mood . . . you'll be looking over your shoulder and checking every room twice , and you'll still jump in your seat and panic on a regular basis . The weaponry is well-selected and very cool . The abilities are plentiful and more than a little awesome to use . The story-telling is magnificent , both the few ( but great ) cut-scenes ( in particular the fully rendered ones ) , and the countless audio logs that you will find throughout the game , many of which contain a new piece ( some bigger than others ) of the puzzle . The level design is of very high quality throughout . There's even a multi-player cooperative mode , which allows you to play the game with your friends , and the game supports it exceptionally well . I myself have completed the game with a friend , and it's quite entertaining , as this allows for the players to specialize in different fields and make up for each others ' shortcomings . Now , as this review has covered just about all of the positive points of the game up to now , sit back and prepare for the negative stuff ( yup , sorry ) . The open-ended game-play also means that you won't really get a good chance to determine which abilities are better . . . meaning , you'll have to try the game several times ( which isn't bad if you do like it , but you may find yourself stuck with abilities you don't really want ) , each time choosing something new if you want to find out which weapons and abilities are more effective or fit your way of playing better . There's no going back ; once you've chosen a set of abilities to specialize in , you have to stick with them . Also , when you upgrade your abilities , you just have to guess if you can afford the level after the next . . . you can only see what the immediate level costs , not the next . You never know what the weapons or items you want to use will require in main abilities . . . not until you find them , anyway , and by then , you're expected to use them ( the game will send enemies your way that are fiendishly hard to beat without said weapons ) . The game keeps gaining in difficulty level , without bothering to check if you're keeping up with it or not . The graphics are somewhat unsatisfying for a game of ' 99 ( considering that there are plenty of games of the same year with better graphics ) . This can be helped by downloading the fan-made high definition graphics , but still . Once you know what you're supposed to do , the game is somewhat short . . . this time , I beat it in no less than 11 play hours . . . that's not even a weekend . Keeping in mind that I did know from past experience what I was supposed to do , but still . . . it's not a whole lot compared to Deus Ex , which has at least twice as many playing hours as this game had the first time I played through ( 20 , give or take ) . Near the end , the game developers seems to have run out of good ideas for missions and challenges . . . jumping puzzles ? Max Payne may stoop to that level for keeping the player occupied , but System Shock 2 shouldn't have to . Not a game of this caliber . Finally , the game doesn't seem to be as stable as it should be , and it might throw you out of the game . . . in the middle of saving , to boot . . . rendering your save game useless and forcing you to start all over , unless you made a safety save earlier . The game has pretty much the same system of loading a new area as Half-Life . . . only here , you're ( mostly ) told that the game will load . Problem is , during these loads , the game crashes all too often , forcing you to rely on aforementioned save-games . All in all , an excellent game , but not an entirely flawless one . I recommend it to any fan of RPG , action , horror , survival and / or cyberpunk . Get it ; chances are very high you won't regret it .
450160	2093818	20629	9.0	Effective anti-war film . . . they don't call it the best of its kind for nothing	The original anti-war film and visualization of the Remarque novel . If this doesn't make you hate war , it is safe to say that nothing will . I watched the remake of ' 79 before this , and that allows me to draw comparisons ( something which the high quality of both films demands ) . Certain decisions were made in the case of either film being produced ; creative calls . Both versions have something that the other doesn't . On the whole , I'd say that this includes more of the most important scenes , apart from two major decisions ( in the field of editing and revealing of information . . . how much the audience is allowed to know and at what point ) at the end . Also , one scene close to the end wasn't included in this one , and it proved to be powerful in the later version . The plot is great , and it evolves at an excellent speed . The pacing , in general , works much better than that of the latter film . It's dreary when that works in the context of what's going on , intense when it needs to be and you're never bored . I couldn't take my eyes off the film for a single second . The acting is for the very most part exceptional , though there is some noticeable overacting ( almost certainly due to the fact that this was so soon after sound came to movies . . . the actors simply weren't that accustomed to speaking yet ) . It hurts the film a little bit , but it's easily ignored . As is the comedic aspect of the film , which is just a tad too dominant and bears evidence of the humor of the time ( that of The Three Stooges and the likes ) , though it does harm the serious tone some ( if only slightly ) . The film is amazing . The effects are incredible . There's no Hollywood in this ; no fireball explosions and no heroes . Just realistic effects and real people . The tone is bleak and unpleasant . This comes as close to how real war must feel like as is possible through the film medium ( at the very least at the time it was made ) . The battle scenes are noisy , chaotic and unsettling . The time spent in a bunker is claustrophobic and echoes of uncertainty . . . what will come next ? The writing is fantastic . Though lacking the story-telling crutch of voice-over narration that the later-produced film utilized , the points are made perfectly and the story well-told . The cinematography and editing are practically flawless , and work astoundingly well . The details are magnificent , so much is covered herein . I cannot help but admire the sheer amount of planning that went into this . All in all , I'd rate this a bit higher than the remake . . . but I urge for anyone watching one to watch the other and decide for themselves . Both are marvelous films , and both have something that the other lacks . As an anti-war film , as a piece of well-rounded film-making , and as an accurate and effective account of war , I consider this the superior of the two . The other has more steady acting and better build-up of some important plot points ( the human beauty in the main character , most noticeably ) . I recommend that anyone who has the chance and who believes that they have the fortitude to sit through such strong and painful films watches both . Not to be missed .
450717	2093818	246578	10.0	How is your depth perception ?	Repeated viewings of this is part of the requirement to fully appreciate this . Also included are genuine effort to get into it , thought applied to putting it all together , and obviously sufficient attention span . Reading the FAQ and visiting the site for it , and working through the puzzles found there , also help . I don't mean to scare people away from this , more to inform . This is like a jigsaw puzzle , and not a simple one at that . When the pieces do all come together . . . well , I imagine that it's satisfying , I honestly can't claim it's happened for me yet . But I really can't find anything in this to criticize . The plot is interesting , and develops throughout . The pacing is deliberate , nothing is rushed or dwelled upon in a manner it shouldn't be . The acting is flawless . The philosophy and food for thought are well-done . Editing and cinematography are excellent . They're experimental ( that , in fact , is a word that really applies to this entire film ) without being flashy or over-stylized . The music is amazing and always well-chosen . The production never shows that its budget was little by today's standards . The effects are astounding in every case . Kelly definitely deserves his work being noticed . The overall concept is well-thought out , and while this is certainly not the first depiction of it , even on the silver screen , it is the most " realistic " and consistent one , and it's near the top of the list as far as how engaging it is ( The Butterfly Effect does , for me , beat this in that respect , but I will admit that the writers of that did do stuff that was more cool than it was sensible , if not very often ) . I understand that the Director's Cut is the version that largely explains what happens , whereas the Theatrical ( which is the only I've seen thus far ) , to a wider degree leaves it up to individual interpretation . There is a bit of disturbing content , and there is some language , as well as dialog that should perhaps not reach younger ears . In any event , this is hardly meant for children . I recommend this to fans of Richard Kelly , the others involved in making it , and dark science fiction that you , when or if you watch , must be an active participant of .
449922	2093818	33467	10.0	A great piece of cinema , a magnificent example of storytelling	I've heard so much told about Citizen Kane and Orson Welles , so I finally decided to get the film , and find out if it really is all that it's cracked up to be . . . I must say , it's great . The plot is great , and the way it's told is amazing . The story is first summed up in a matter of minutes , about 15 , to be more accurate , and then the rest of the film has characters telling the story through flashbacks and retelling . We hear just about every opinion about Charles Foster Kane , apart from his own . The story is told after his death , and we see everything important that leads up to it , and only in the very end do we understand him , only then do we fully understand who he was , and what made him so . The ending also reveals one of the very most important things in any man or woman . . . one thing that everyone needs and knows of . I won't reveal it here , as it would almost be a crime to spoil the experience of this film to anyone . The acting is excellent ; Welles himself is stellar as Kane , and his impressive appearance , along with his commanding voice , makes the character a forceful sight , nay , experience . The characters are well-written and credible . The character of Kane is probably the most well-rounded and perfectly built up I've seen in a movie , ever . The cinematography is excellent . . . the editing is great . I can't praise the angles , pans , zooms and transitions enough . . . it just has to be experienced . Now , for the one thing I can criticize in the film ; the pacing . It's only two hours long , but it feels like much , much more . There were portions of the film where it felt like it didn't move at all . When there weren't great dialog or something equally as good in the film , it dragged terribly . There were too many scenes where the dialog seemed pointless , as well , I think . It didn't seem to be leading to anything . However , this criticism is so minor , due to the ending more than making up for it , that I still give this film a perfect score . I can't do anything but agree with its placing at the top of the top # 250 films of all time , here on IMDb . As I'm writing this , it's # 11 . That's pretty much what it deserves , in my opinion . Not higher , not lower . Not the greatest film of all time ( that pretty much still belongs to The Godfather , I think . . . at least , I haven't seen a better film than that , yet ) , but definitely far up there . I recommend this to any fan of film in general , and anyone who thinks they can understand it ; it has a truly profound point that any man ( and woman ) should know of ( preferably through seeing the film for themselves ) . Don't let the fact that it's old and black & white deter you from seeing this masterpiece . A true cinematic masterpiece , in every sense of the word .
450895	2093818	105695	10.0	Excellent western drama	Clint Eastwood makes very good films . He's a good actor , but an even better director . This drama takes place in the old wild West , and it presents a fairly accurate depiction of life in that time . The sets and the costumes are perfectly convincing . The plot is good , and it moves along at a good pace . The characters are all very well-written and their actions are understandable . The actors all do perfect jobs , especially the three main ones , Clint Eastwood himself , Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman , all of which is well-known for their previous excellent performances . They all do perfect jobs at portraying their respective characters . The cinematography is also excellent . The visuals are impressive , while remaining dirty and unattractive . The violence in the movie is especially made to be everything but attractive in any way , shape or form . There are moments where you will literally be shocked at the way the violence is presented . I also thought that the prologue and epilogue of the film was an excellent way of telling how the story begins and ends . For a drama , it can't get a lot better than this . I recommend this to anyone who likes Clint Eastwood's directing style , and people who like dramas that take place in the old wild West .
450133	2093818	68646	10.0	Definitely deserves its high rating	I haven't seen all dramas , nor have I ever seen all movies made that revolve around the mafia , but this is the best drama I've ever seen , and the best movie that revolves around the mafia , by far . Marlon Brando is a fantastic actor , and while I haven't seen any other films with him , I can't imagine that he's done much better work than he did in this film . Al Pacino was also great in the film , and I think it was fairly early in his career . The film is character and plot driven , which is a welcome change from the action-driven films which is the dominant genre today . The film is never predictable , and is free from the typical cliches that pester most dramas . For a crime drama , it's very entertaining and interesting , for a drama , it's very well-paced , and for a film it's just damn good in pretty much every way . The plot is good , very well-written and interesting ; I don't think I've ever payed so much attention to a drama , let alone one that takes almost three hours . It just grabbed my attention from the very first frame , the very first words that were spoken caught my attention , and didn't lose it for a second . It has a good pace , it doesn't rush through the scenes , yet it never gets stale or boring either . The acting is great , all the way around , every single actor does a great job . There weren't any that I felt gave a less than great performance . The characters were well-written , credible and well-developed . There weren't any of the characters that I felt I knew too little of , like it is with most new films , even dramas . The direction and editing is great , some of the cinematography is magnificent . The dialog is well-written and well-delivered . The film has some very quotable and memorable lines . The violence is well-made and not overdone in any way ; it shows the ruthless killings that were , in fact , being committed by the mafia at the time period that the film takes place in . The film shows , with brutal honesty and without censoring details or violence , how the mafia worked , and how big their influence was in the 1940's . A truly great piece of cinema , worth your time if you have at least a vague interest in crime dramas or films dealing with the mafia . I recommend it to pretty much everyone , especially fans of any of the actors , the director or crime dramas . Also recommendable to anyone who is interested in mafia films .
