450502	2093818	116723	1.0	You have been found guilty on the charge of being a dreadful movie , and are hereby condemned to obscurity and widespread , justified hatred	If this is not heavily featured on every list of " what not to watch " , it should only be because those keeping that particular list are not aware of its existence , which , as long as that remains so , is the acceptable alternative . I'm not kidding you , this is a bad " movie " . Joseph Meeker returns from the dead , with various vague , undefined supernatural powers , the most employed of which would seem to be appearing in new , increasingly comical-looking and ridiculous ( and never scary or creepy . . . in general , when this goes for the latter of those , it winds up just being bizarre , and attempts at the former just don't work , period ) outfits and stereotypes / archetypes , and he is portrayed by David Keith ( whom I respect in . . . well , at least Daredevil ) , doing a more often than not terribly inconsistent ( which could also have to do with script ) and often over the top performance . A character or two have personalities so unbelievably irritating that they're painful to watch . The editing thinks it's considerably more clever than it really is ( and what on Earth was with the red tint for the flashbacks ? ) . Cinematography . . . oh , dear . Framing , coverage , effective use of angle ( that one could be attributed some to editing , too , perhaps ) , please , guys , stop me when I say something you've ever heard about the existence of . As far as the technical side goes , this is a pretty lousy excuse for something more worthwhile to put in the projector than unexposed film . But why stop there ? The plot is just poor . The basic idea's been done , and it's been done so much better than this ( The Crow would be one ) . The way it's told is gimmicky , and while there is some explanation behind the flashbacks , it still doesn't satisfy . Pacing is about non-existent . The lead is distinctly unlikeable , and there's more personality in a barn door , not to mention that those are also considerably less wooden . Kelly Perine and Thomas Ian Nicholas ? What in the name of all that is good and just ( pun intended ) are you doing in this ? Perine , you were already funny before this , on The Drew Carey Show , Nicholas , well , I haven't seen you in anything preceding American Pie , but if nothing else , you were funny later on , and in those productions , the amusement was intentional . Dialog is . . . the less said , the better . Language is unrestrained , and tends to be stupid . The violence is shoddily done , and they don't even seem to care to try to hide it ( hinting at it might have been the smarter strategy ) . Characters , don't get me started . Why spend so much energy on portraying unexciting , at times utterly illogical , events ? The more you think about this , the worse it gets . It's not even passable as a " bad horror flick " , or a B movie ( it may very well pass through the rest of the alphabet , and go further still ) , it couldn't scare you on the scariest day of your life if it had an electrified scaring machine . I recommend this only to people who want to disprove how bad this is , and don't say I didn't warn ya .
449856	2093818	318763	1.0	And here you thought the original was bad . . .	This is pretty much the first Jason Scott Lee film I've seen . I say pretty much , because I have also seen Soldier , in which he plays the villain . . . but from what I've heard , it's not considered a Jason Scott Lee film . This , however , is . And if this is any indication of the quality of such films , I won't be seeing any of the others . Lee is basically passable as a martial arts artist . . . as the lead , he's awful . He gets in a fight with random no-name characters every few minutes of the film , probably because the script writer couldn't figure out how else to stretch out the film to the minimum required running time for a feature film . The villain is the only character with even a hint of personality , and aside from the fact that he's certifiably insane , he barely seems like a villain at all . The majority of the film is basically Lee chasing the villain through time . . . or maybe it's the other way around . I can't say for sure . . . and I definitely wouldn't watch it again to make sure . The effects are not completely horrible . . . but it's close . The title comes from the popular idea of using a time-machine to go and kill Hitler . Somehow , the film screws up that interesting idea as well . The plot is too complicated for its own good . The pacing is poor . I can't think of one positive thing to say about this film . . . I really can't . It's simply too formulaic and pointless . If only I had a time-machine , so I could go back and prevent this film from ever being made . . . no , never mind . I just hope as few fragile minds are exposed to this as possible . Listen to the negative reviewers . Avoid this turkey . I recommend this to fans of Lee , and no one else . If you're looking for a quality film . . . well , this isn't it . That's for sure .
449946	2093818	295701	1.0	Brings new meaning to the term ' insulting to the viewers intelligence '	Values change over time . A hundred years ago , you were happy if you could live past the age of thirty and had someone you liked to spend your time with . Until recently , you expected an action film to be more than a muscled guy spouting poor one-liners and blowing stuff up . Well , I guess that would be recently meaning up to the early 80's . . . but this is really setting a new standard , breaking all limits and going through the bottom and setting a whole new low . When did movies get this damn loud ? I had to turn down the volume before the opening title appeared on the screen . Before I proceed with this review , I must give you an example of just how bad it is , try to give you an idea of it . About three minutes into the film , a guy ( who is clearly a secret agent , and clearly meant to die right away ) runs through a crowded dance floor , knowing he's been spotted . Instead of trying to disappear in the crowd ( come on , nobody does that anymore . . . right ? I mean , it wouldn't do anything . . . not even throw off the orientation of whoever is chasing him and give the sniper aiming at him a run for his money ) , he jumps up on the stage . . . making himself the most obvious freaking target ever . So what happens ? He gets shot . Big surprise . Yeah , but what happens next ? He falls backwards into the crowds ' hands , who treat him like he was stage-diving . . . ( backwards . . . unmoving . . . with a big , red spot on the front of his suit . . . honestly , how much does the film-makers expect us to swallow ? ) No , seriously . At that point ( well , actually even before that ) I knew that the movie I was about to see wouldn't have any value or serve as anything even remotely interesting . It's not even a decent time-killer . . . I've stared at spots that were far more exciting than the fake , clearly orchestrated action . I've seen drunks and stoners that were more coordinated than the gun hit placements in this film . The plot makes no conceivable sense . The pacing is so far off that I'm surprised I didn't fall asleep a few minutes ( not to say it wasn't a struggle ) . The acting is horrendous , with one or two possible exceptions . One thing I want to make perfectly clear ; Vin Diesel is NOT one of those exceptions . Vin Diesel . . . what kind of a damn name is that ? You don't have to be a genius to figure out it's a fake name ( oh , sorry , an ' artistic ' name . . . please ) . You want to know his real name ? Check his biography . No , wait , I'll make it even easier ; I'll tell you . It's Mark Vincent . Now doesn't that just sound cool ? No ? Well , apparently Mark didn't think so either . What's that ? He was convinced that he wouldn't be popular with that name ? Well , Schwarzenegger didn't change his name . Neither did Van Damme . They seem popular enough . . . right ? The truth is , Mark is just a poser . . . he's just another muscled guy who can't act but who is attractive to the girls ( god only knows what they find so damn amazing by that brainless jock ) . He spends half of the movie talking about how it's bull that video-games and violent movies corrupt the American youth , and you can't help but think about what he says . . . and realize it's true . He's the one corrupting them , he and anyone else responsible for this movie and any other of its kind . All this talk of anarchy and the general ' screw you ' attitude towards any form of authority . . . seriously , it's like they're trying hard to turn kids against parents , teachers and cops . Isn't America sufficiently plagued with young criminals ? And what the hell is up with the thoroughly misogynistic way of presenting female characters ? Just about all of them are whores and generally just there to please the men . No protests , no ' I'm better than this stuff ' attitude anywhere . . . they just accept that women are made to serve men , and nothing else . The one female character who isn't " giving it away for free " as my favorite character ever , Dr . Cox of the TV show Scrubs would put it , is still a hooker . I think her exact words are ' I could be your girl instead of his ( the bad guy's ) . . . if you would pay me as much as he does ' . OK , so maybe she isn't really a prostitute . . . but she falls head over heels over Mark , after knowing him for very little time . Finally , I'd just like to say that the effects are generally horrid , the action is dull , derivative and lacking in any imagination or creativity and the weapon / gadgets usually work as a huge tease . Being the big lover of weapons that I am , I was a tad excited when Mark was handed what has to be one of the biggest damn hand-cannons seen on film . Imagine my disappointment when the sap barely uses it at all . The same goes for gadgets ( less important , but still ) . Also , near the end , Mark gets to drive a bad-ass car with a trunk-load ( literally ) of destructive hardware . . . and it's only used for having the typical ' there must be something here we can use / oh what does this button do then ' scene . The characters are all stereotypes and clichés , with Mark being the guy who saves the world because he has muscles , a low vocabulary , a ridiculous accent and some poor one-liners , Asia being the girl who falls in love with Mark for no apparent reason , the geek who gives Mark his gadgets ( I won't bother to change his name ) . Eve even shows up , seemingly just to tell off a video game producer . . . because Mark won't ' sell out ' . Whatever the hell that means . Wouldn't someone fighting for video-games be honored or consider it a victory to have his own game ? I recommend this only to fans of Mark as well as mindless teenagers with no conception of how the real world works . If you're still not sure , yes , I do hate Mark Vincent / Vin Diesel . I really do .
449807	2093818	111301	1.0	Eh . . . wake me up when it's over . . .	When Jean-Claude Van Damme is starring in a film , you're already preparing for something bad , but this might actually be the worst film he's made , as it's more than just bad ; it's excruciatingly bad . It's not the worst film ever made , but it's close . For an action / martial arts movie , the fighting / action sequences are very tame and far between . The plot is laughable at best , and full of holes . The acting is painfully bad . The characters are badly written stereotypes , not to mention that the film obviously tries incredibly hard to implement all of the characters from the video-games in the movie , which results in far too many characters , and far too many supposedly interesting characters are pushed into the background and settle for cameos , to make way for the more popular characters . The dialog is awful . The script is horribly badly written . The " humor " is childish and lame . The film has so many unintentionally funny scenes that it must be a record of some kind . The fight sequences are predictable and , like I mentioned earlier , tame . There are also far too few of them , considering that it's supposed to be the driving point of the film , rather than the predictable and badly written plot . The film really doesn't have anything to offer , honestly . I recommend it only to huge fans of Van Damme , and kids / teens with nothing better to do than watch some badly choreographed fights by Van Damme and various badly trained actors . Everyone else , find a better way to kill 90 minutes and skip this one .
449816	2093818	119896	1.0	You know what's funny ? Not this movie . . .	Yep , that's it . Cold and hard . You can call this film ' sweet ' . You can try to justify its existence through every possible way known to man . You can even claim that it's romantic , rather than dated , derivative and ' been there , done that ' . Nothing will change the fact that this film simply is not funny . The humor is just not there . The chemistry between the cast is non-existent . The film reeks of ' could have been ' . There's nothing funny about it . While I watched , I tried come up with things less amusing than this film ; I couldn't think of a thing . Within the first thirty minutes or so , there's an ethnic wedding . Somehow , I felt that it was supposed to be funny , that I should laugh , but nothing about it was even remotely humorous . Early on , there's a scene where Aniston's character's boss tells her she needs to spend more money than she has if she wants a promotion . I couldn't help but be disgusted at this ; in a country where a few people have almost all of the money and so many people have nothing at all , someone actually looks down who doesn't spend more than they need to . Worse even , this is passed off as humor . I felt like turning off the TV at that point , but due to my strong curiosity , in other words , my desire to find out if this garbage got any worse forced me to keep watching . Fortunately , it didn't , but I still couldn't muster up the effort to watch attentively after that first half hour . The plot is so stupid and far-fetched that it's almost a waste of space to put it in writing here , but I feel that I must warn others , deter them from watching this utter mess . Aniston , as just mentioned , can't get a promotion if she doesn't start spending more money . Her friend knows this , so she does what any sensible person would do for their best friend . . . she uses a big , fat lie to get her the promotion . She tells the boss that Aniston is engaged to be wed . Apparently , this also makes her attractive to a guy she's in love with . . . like I said , I didn't pay much attention to it . Not much else to say . . . the acting is fair . Jay Mohr ( who I am a fairly big fan of , and because of whom I watched the film at all ) does very good , as usual . The film isn't really worth watching , for any reason at all . I recommend this only to huge fans of one of the leads and girls who sob over even the most ridiculous love story . No one else should bother .
450667	2093818	222192	1.0	In a word : simple	You know those games where , when you play them , you can barely understand why they were even made , nay , thought up , in the first place ? Well , this is even worse than that . Not only is the reason for the existence of the game seemingly nonexistent , it's so bad in just about every single conceivable way that you can't help but want that it never even passed for a thought in the brains of the creators . The plot is . . . well , not there . I'm not kidding , there seems to be no plot whatsoever . The game takes you through Mickey's most popular cartoon adventures . Yep , that's it . No grand scheme , no explanation , no reason . . . just a bunch of levels with references to ( mostly ) old animated short films . Has the character of Mickey Mouse not been exploited enough ? Has this cartoon mouse not been milked of it's worth , all the profit been had ? Apparently not , at least not in the eyes and minds of the people behind this game . The game-play is about as simple as it gets . Imagine the old Super Mario Land game for the GameBoy . Remember it ? OK , now take it down a notch . . . or three . . . and you're just about there . The game has you controlling Mickey , jumping , running and throwing marbles ( yes , marbles . . . he has a bag of them ; seemingly to make up for the creators ' complete lack thereof ) . That's it . Well , in a level or two you have to activate switches and push stuff around , but it's all so incredibly simple that an infant could do it with left hand behind his back while sleeping . The game is unforgivably short ; I've yet to completely beat it , but this last time , where I got very far , to what I believe was the last level , it took me less than one full hour . Yes , you read that right . Now , I did know what to do ( for the most part ) , but still . . . that's simply too short for a full-price game . Furthermore , it has no replay value whatsoever , since there are no high scores , no hidden stuff , and nothing to be gained from beating it at all , apart from the pride of it . The real problem with this game , why it is really this bad , is that it ignores something basic and very important ; any game must have some clear-cut rules . When you play Super Mario Land , you know that if you jump on top of an enemy ( and it doesn't have spikes on top ) , you're likely to kill it . When you play a Commander Keen game , you know that any enemy can either be killed or avoided . Any game must have rules . . . and this game has none . It seems random , how riddles are solved ; there is no logic . The enemies seem to be randomly put in ; half of them don't even react to you , merely follow a programmed pattern . Some of them can be killed , some can't , some can be jumped to pieces , some need to be shot with the marbles , some can hurt you when they die , some can't . . . and all of this seems completely random . As if the game wasn't properly finished , or the programmers didn't agree on how to do it . On the cover , Mickey looks mighty brave and powerful . . . quite a contrast to the game , in which he spends most of the time looking disoriented and sounding scared out of his mind . Ironic . Level design is lazy . The levels are based on one idea which is then repeated until there are no more variations of it . Levels don't seem to end properly , either . The idea is apparently that you continue the level until you ' rescue ' Mickey from the dangers of the short film he ( or , rather , the old ' him ' ) is in ( though half of the time , the danger isn't at all apparent to the player ) . When you die or beat a level , the screen fades to black , with no sign of which you did . You have to await either the loading screen , signifying that you made it through the level , or an animation of Mickey falling down with a flower in one of his hands , straight up , accompanied by a crude trumpet tune . About the animations , could they possibly be any more dull and simple ? I highly doubt it . The music and sound are similarly uncreative and lacking in imagination . The game has no extra stuff , apart from a sound test that allows you to listen to most of the individual sound effects and the music one by one , but that's about it . In case anyone is wondering , I bought this game because I thought it was a different one . . . one I liked . Well , it wasn't , and here we are . However , please do not mistake the negativity herein to be caused by that disappointment . Had the game been any good . . . I think my biggest problem with this game is that you just shouldn't be charged for acquiring it . Seriously , I've played better free games . Lots of them . The game is entirely geared at kids , sacrificing any chance of anyone over the age of 7 enjoying it . Now , I know that kids that age like to have things simple and straight-forward , but this is ridiculous . I could easily imagine kids of that age laying the controller down after having tried it going , " Oh , come on ! " . The worst thing about this game is really the wasted potential ; it's not a bad idea , having Mickey run through his well-known adventures . . . any nostalgic fans could have gotten a real kick out of a good game based on that . The graphics aren't half bad . There's even a nice mix of 2D and 3D visuals in some levels . It's a shame that it isn't put to better use . It really is . I recommend this to no one but kids who are such big fans of Mickey Mouse that they can't stand the very thought of there being a game featuring him that they don't own . Everyone else . . . stay away . For your own sake . You'll never forgive yourself if you don't .
449776	2093818	117765	1.0	A T & A movie . . . with a plot ? ! ? Who came up with that ?	Like Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls , this is a T & A movie . The thing is , while Verhoeven knew what T & A was about ( T & A standing for Tits and Ass , it's obviously nudity ) , Andrew Bergman ( who I suppose is the person to blame for this movie ) doesn't ; I guess he thought it should be more than just nudity , and tries to inject a drama plot . Newsflash : naked girls and family troubles don't mix . Any teenager can tell you that . Apparently , Bergman didn't know , or maybe he was trying to " break new ground " . . . who knows . The result is a mess . One minute you're seeing half-naked ladies with fake breasts , the other you're expected to care about the main character's child and her difficulties with getting custody . It just doesn't work . The plot is decent at best ; it probably could have worked , with a hell of a lot of work done to it and in a very different movie . But as it is , it doesn't work , on any level . The acting is mostly ridiculous ; I guess the actors didn't take it too seriously and just went through it as campy as they could . Apart from Demi , who apparently believed that the film was serious . The characters are poorly written clichés . Robert Patrick's character is too cartoonish , and , frankly , belongs in a slapstick comedy . It was interesting to see a role so different from the hard-ass characters he normally portrays , but still . He added very little comic relief , and mainly came off as a pathetic attempt at it . Burt Reynolds ' character was also so over the top that you didn't know whether to laugh , cry , or feel sorry for him . The dialog is amateurish and the script is poorly written . The humor is childish and the film tries far too hard at making you laugh , which pretty much only results in the audience cringing over it . Basically , the film could have been something , had it just determined to be a drama or a T & A flick ; ' cause it sure as hell doesn't work well as both . The climax of the film brings one or two smirks , but no real laughs , and in the end , you feel like you've just wasted almost two hours that could have been spent doing something far more creative . If you want to look at naked women , find a better T & A film , or search the Internet . If you want to see a naked Demi Moore , look for one of the other films where she gets undressed , or , failing that , look for screen-caps of this film . Whatever you do , avoid this one . It's really bad . Really . Bad . I recommend this to no one , apart from possibly people who are willing to do anything and watch anything just to see Demi's breasts . Or people who'll watch anything , for one reason or another .
450433	2093818	94074	1.0	The last remnants of sense disappear in a film of two messages . . . one more heavy-handed and preachy than the other	As much as I hate to go with popular consensus , I must admit that it is quite accurate in the case of this film . . . it blows . It blows with the power of its title character's super-breath . Oh golly me , how it blows . Nuclear Man looks and sounds ( apart from the fact that his lines being spoken in Gene Hackman's voice , for no apparent reason ) like something out of one of the Conan movies . Superman defies logic and science ( yes , I know . . . but he does it more in this one than in the two preceding it put together ) , as does the film . And worst is the moralizing . The plot is quite poor . This is most definitely a sequel . . . and one that shows signs of a series that should have had the plug pulled several films back ( right after the first , some would say ) . The writing displays a general lack of creativity . Luthor is brought back . . . slightly louder and less charismatic this time . We are introduced to Lenny , portrayed by Jon Cryer . I , for one , did not need to see this man playing a teenager . He's much funnier in Hot Shots and on Two and a Half Men . And what was with the complete and utter waste of Jim Broadbent ? The man hardly utters a word in this film , and his screen-time is so small , he could have been an extra . I haven't seen much of him , but even from that ( BlackAdder and Moulin Rouge ) , I would gladly sign ( or perhaps even start ) a petition to legally change his name to Funny Man . The humor takes the leap out of the campiness of the previous effort , but the plunge in writing and directing keeps the audience consistently underwhelmed . The film is hardly dramatic . . . the action sequences dire and unengaging . The writing scrapes bottom so hard that it goes right through , with no stop in sight . How many different similarly-abled beings is Supes gonna fight before actually facing a villain we know ( from the comics ) , other than Luthor ? I realize that Lex is his arch-nemesis , but it's as if these writers have gone to extreme measures just to avoid doing what is arguably easy ( simply hand-picking a villain already known ) , but also what the real fans want . How many decades of history does this character have ? It shouldn't be difficult to find someone suitable . The writers of the old series of Batman films managed . . . four times , no less . Granted , they also managed to screw up basically every film but the first , but they did have the assistance of Joel Schumacher , a director without any sense of making a comic book come to life as a film . Back to this failure , sorry , film . . . the effects are worse than ever before . The budget is quite clearly to blame . The attempts at drama or comedy are usually cringe-worthy . . . as is the nature and heavy-handed delivery of the two messages . It just winds up sounding incredibly preachy . Yes , we get it . . . nuclear power is dangerous , newspapers should be about news , not making money . Now stop trying to be morally superior . . . that , incidentally , is not what movies are about . The acting is fine . All in all , this just really doesn't have anything to offer . If you want food for thought on either message , read up on it or watch a documentary about it . If you want to see a good ( or even passable ) superhero film , look elsewhere . Consult the fan-base for more info on which of the previous films in this series is better , or go with another hero ( or check out Singer's vision , and hope that he gets to keep making them as long as he does as good as he has with the first ) . I recommend this to fans of admittedly bad movies , as that is the only way this has any value at all , and as a lesson in what not to do when making a good film , for directors-to-be .
450723	2093818	299930	1.0	Oh the humanity	As this aired on TV , having heard nothing but awful things about it , I decided to see for myself if they were true . Oh how they are . From the very first frame . The Italian ( who aren't the only in this mess , trust me ) stereotypes are irritating right from the beginning . I am not certain if absolutely nothing positive came from the couple ? I don't really make it a point to look into the personal lives of celebrities ? but if anything did , this was not it . Say it with me ? just because two people work off screen does not mean they will on as well . Both of them having a poorly done accent each doesn't really help . The plot is never engaging and consistently utterly uninteresting . The pacing is drab . For the entirety of this picture , nothing whatsoever happens . This overstays its welcome something fierce . The language really felt thrown in , without any actual point to it . There are aspects of this that are just offensive . Walken and Pacino must be kicking themselves . Not a single scene is captivating or entertaining . The dialog is largely unimpressive , and holds no memorable or quotable lines . It also tries far too hard to sound eloquent . Filming and editing are average at best . Neither Lopez nor Affleck are particularly convincing . At least the latter doesn't hold any delusions of ability as a musician , and has proved himself an actual actor elsewhere . I recommend this solely to the biggest fans of Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck . Everyone else ? you have been warned .
450510	2093818	146402	1.0	Horrible from start to finish	Not one single good gag . Not one single funny line throughout the film . The entire cast gives lousy performances . I know that when the film was made , Raul Julia ( may he rest in peace ) had died , and that Christina Ricci was getting a little too old to play Wednesday ; but did they really have to recast everyone else , too ? The only original cast members left are Carel Struycken ( Lurch ) and Christopher Hart ( Thing ) . All of the new cast is severely miscast ; Tim Curry has pulled off some good performances in the past , but come on , he's just not Gomez . Not in a million years . He lacks the ' Latin-American ' spirit that Raul possessed . Daryl Hannah obviously tries hard to portray a Morticia faithful to Anjelica Huston , but she fails ; she's too lively , and far too naturally beautiful ; they tried to cover it up ( well , mostly . . . for some reason , she shows cleavage in the last scene . . . who thought of that ? Ridiculously out of character . ) but they couldn't . Another problem is that she's too luscious , whereas Morticia is supposed to have a dangerously , unhealthy thin figure . Patrick Thomas , who plays Fester , is a joke . A bad one . He overdoes Fester so horribly , that I actually cringed every single second he was on screen . I doubt that he could have done much worse . The new child actors are also bad ; Nicole Fugere as Wednesday lacks the eeriness and creepiness of Christina Ricci . She never conveys any sort of emotion , not even the disgust that Ricci did so well in the previous two films , whenever something happy or lively was around . Nicole lacks that talent ; she just looks the part , that's all . It's pretty much the same with Jerry Messing , the new Pugsley . He looks pretty much like Pugsley is supposed to look , but lacks the acting ability of Jimmy Workman , the actor from the two previous films . The humor of the film is as bad as it gets ; whereas the first two had great black humor , this one is reduced to childish humor , which just every once in a while has a bit of ' blackness ' to it . But it's all childish , which means tons of humiliation of , and ridiculous amounts of pain inflicted to , different characters for no apparent reason ( other than to make children and people with equally bad humor laugh ) . The effects are also excruciatingly bad ; you would have thought that they'd have developed better techniques through the five-six years that passed between making the previous film in the series and this . I mean , honestly , the effects look worse than they did back in the first film . All in all , this is one of the worst films I've ever seen , and I think it's too bad that they had to end the series with such a horribly unfunny film . I don't recommend this horrid piece of garbage to anyone , even children shouldn't be mistreated and go through the pure torture it is to watch this wretched film . You think I'm exaggerating ? See it for yourself . . . no , better yet ; take my word for it . . . it's horrible . One of the most pathetic attempts at comedy I've ever had the enduring pain of watching . If you do decide to give this film a chance , be prepared for the absolute worst . You were warned . . .
450662	2093818	120741	3.0	Decent at best , not particularly funny spoof of gangster films	When this movie started , I thought I was going to see a good , intelligent spoof of mafia films . When the main theme played , and I immediately recognized it as a spoof of the main theme to the great gangster film , Once Upon A Time in America . Then it continued , and got increasingly stupid . Every single shot was packed with gags that only a child would find funny . There are occasionally gags and jokes that are actually funny , but the majority of them are just childish . The plot is ridiculous , and rips off ( I would say spoofed , but that would mean it would have to have been funny ) most major mafia / crime / gangster films . The pacing is horrible . I only found about ten jokes funny , and there were probably several hundred in total . The acting was pretty bad , but Jay Mohr was cool and Applegate was acceptable . The characters are all clichés and stereotypes ( which they are supposed to be , of course ) but they aren't funny . The only quality this had that made it tolerable was Jay Mohr . He manages to make even the most childish gag funny , and boosts the fun factor in every scene he's in . I suppose I shouldn't have expected a higher quality film from the people behind similar stupidity like Hot Shots ! , but this was such a good opportunity . . . there are so many scenes in big mafia films that could easily be made fun of , in good taste , instead of this crap . All in all , a pretty dull film with a very childish sense of humor . I recommend this only to fans of the Zucker style of humor . Everyone else should probably avoid this .
449927	2093818	388451	5.0	Informs	This is a special feature that you can view on the second of the 2 discs of the DVD of Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines . Well , technically , that should be " several " , not " a " . And if you want to be get really pedantic , a little of this bunch allows for a little interactivity , also . I'll get last-mentioned out of the way immediately : It's called " make your own effect " , and it's essentially two sequences where you can switch certain animated elements on or off . That's it . The rest are featurettes on the various scenes that had FX work done on them . I count it to come to about 47 minutes , not counting any time spent on the " game " . They go into moderate detail , and through interviews and footage of the actual producing , they tell the audience how they did the specific things , be it stunts , CGI or miniatures . If you're interested in knowing , this does a fine enough job . I can't claim that it ever drew me in . . . and its rigid and unvaried setup , with having the display of " choosing the method " can get tiresome to look at , in particular in the couple of areas where we can easily figure out what they used . All in all , this is a reasonable enough collection , and I can't quite claim I understand the amount of votes of no more than 1 ( ! ) . I recommend this to those who watched the film ( so as to avoid spoilers ) and would like to know how they did the convincing . . . or even the few that aren't . . . bits of movie magic .
449952	2093818	120458	5.0	If this comes on some day when you've got absolutely nothing else to do and you don't expect anything from the film , give it a try . . . otherwise , avoid it	My friend and I found this one night at Blockbuster . It looked nice . . . fairly appealing cast , plot sounds like it might be good and it certainly looks like it could contain some very good science fiction ( which I live and breathe for , basically ) . So , we rented it . That was a few years ago . . . years where I haven't really given the film much thought . We pretty much enjoyed the film , didn't think much about it since then . Then , I saw it was being transmitted on TV a few days ago , taped it , and now , I've just seen it again . What can I say , other than pointing out that my friend and I must have had incredibly low expectations , been desperate for a film we hadn't seen or just in extreme denial because none of us would admit how bad a decision it certainly must have been to rent it . I couldn't remember any of it . . . and now I know why . For instantly obvious reasons , my sub-conscious must have erased the memory of the film to maintain my respect for the people involved and to keep me from thinking back on the rental with regret . This seriously is about as bad as they get . The plot is poor , derivative and has more holes than a Swiss cheese that has been mauled by a Gatling gun . The pacing is so off that you're almost falling asleep . The acting is unbelievably amateurish , even for the likes of Jamie Lee Curtis ( who has herself said this film sucked in an interview ) , Donald Sutherland ( who doesn't seem to be able to pick an accent to stick with , or even decide for sure if he's going to use one or not ) and the Baldwin brother ( whichever of them it was , I can barely tell them apart , particularly when the film is so dull , pointless and boring ) . Character development and motivation is non-existent . The writers clearly didn't have a lot of ideas , so they just kept doing the same thing over and over . In the end , there's a robot that comes back again more times than The Terminator itself . The film doesn't display even the least bit of originality , creativity or imagination . You're probably better off not seeing it , unless you really want to see just how bad it is . I recommend this mess of a film only to huge fans of the people involved . However , it is a better film than Deep Rising . . . that much I will say . One to skip , and , if necessary , avoid .
450844	2093818	424774	5.0	Hardly devoid of charm	As much as this is an indulgence , it is at least not the man himself , but his offspring and their dreams ( as stated in the very opening credits , removing any possible doubt as to that being the case or not ) . Whether or not such a thing can be made into something amazing , that is not the case here . Few will contest that . But looking further , this does have some merit . By no means the greatest writer , Rodriguez does have both creativity and a well-developed imagination . He lets them roam free in large parts of this , and actually comes up with a clever thing or two , amongst that which ? isn't . Some of the humor is childish , and certain gags are repeated somewhat ad naseum . Downright cringe-inducing does it become when a character actually follows up his quip , painful enough already , with an explanation of the double meaning . And that even happens more than once . The puns most definitely could have been , well , done without entirely , in an awful lot of cases . Characters are terribly flat and one-note ? fleshing out never has been Robert's strong suit . Designs aren't half bad . The CGI could be better , if worse has been seen . The action is invariably quite entertaining , the fighting in particular . The acting varies , with a larger portion only reaching " passable " . Like the first Spy Kids ( I haven't watched the others ) , this has a moral to it , if a relatively naive one , and the content is perfectly acceptable to show even to the youngest family members . Everything is fairly simplified herein . I recommend this to fans of Robert Rodriguez , and / or those fond of comic books , a style captured rather skilfully here .
450322	2093818	97778	5.0	Why would he have John Travolta's smile ?	Who was this film made for ? Can't be the kids , as much as they might enjoy all of the , albeit not really visually graphic , gross-out comedy , seeing as how there are some fairly intimidating sequences throughout ( and the language isn't exactly child-proof , either , though it could be worse ) . The focus is entirely on the single mother and her child , so few men will ( willingly ) watch . No , this seems to have been made explicitly for the group that the main character belongs to , 30-something single mothers who , in spite of being smart , make stupid decisions ( which will annoy women not in that group , I would guess ) . I watched this for the first time in years , and it's really almost sad how little of it I remembered or recognized . The plot , I suppose , isn't awful , and realistic enough ( disregarding the entire premise of the child " talking " ) , but it does seem like they merely made up just enough to bring it to 90 minutes , and to tie together the various scenes of the toddler in situations that such would find themselves in , with Bruce Willis doing a voice of what the kid might be thinking / trying to say ( well , at least it's not as bad as Garfield , where sometimes , Jon seems to understand the Tabby perfectly , whereas others , he isn't picking up anything but the fact that his lazy pet is trying to communicate ) , so that the whole movie wasn't just of that ( that would have been unbearable , even Hollywood couldn't have asked that of human beings ) . The humor usually doesn't work . There was maybe one brief point I found amusing , and that was it . The joke of every bit that has Willis doing the voice is that as far back as the womb ( which we get a visual of . . . because that's what we movie-goers are just dying to see ) , our offspring are intelligent , well-spoken . . . really , the only thing Mikey isn't shown to have , for obvious reasons , is experience . The instances of him talking will amuse some , but once that wears off , you'll find that it's really not funny . At all . The film plods along , at a pace that at times almost seems like a psychological experiment . . . " how much will the viewers take , before they stop watching " , with the occasional nightmare . Good pieces of music are used in the movie , where the choice of that particular song is downright frighteningly obvious . And this got two sequels and a TV show . I recommend this to those who find themselves in the group for which this film was intended . . . whatever it is .
450365	2093818	124038	5.0	Terrorists in a small town ? Young , faceless teens to the rescue !	First of all , this really has too little action to be classified as an action film . . . it should have been labeled ' thriller ' instead . Second , I haven't read the book nor have I seen the other version of this film . Now that we've gotten that out of the way , this is pretty much the typical Hollywood-like action B-movie , as well as what the common viewer ( well , this common viewer , at least ) have come to expect of Danish movies . The bad guys speak English with very see-through accent ( some of the dialog even reveals them as Danish . . . talk about poorly done ) despite the fact that they are supposed to be from another country ( can't write which here , it would be a spoiler ) , non-English speaking ( well , it wouldn't be their first language , like it is in the movie , anyway ) . The characters are about as simple and stereotypical as they can be . The main bad guy apparently didn't look mean enough on his own , so they bleached his hair and gave him an awful haircut . The teenagers are about as heroic as they can possibly be . The adult characters in the movie are as helpless as you can imagine for a kids film . . . wait , what ? No , this is an R-rated action-thriller . . . something must be wrong . . . ah , of course . . . it's a Danish film . Seriously , what's wrong with Danish cinema ? I have no idea . The plot is tame and unrealistic . The terrorists ' motivations are non-existent and nonsensical . The dialog is uncreative . The action is poorly done and lacks any intensity . The direction is all over the place . The acting is so pitifully bad that I felt like threatening the actors at gunpoint with the words " don't you ever , ever set foot on a movie production set again " . All in all , the film just isn't really worth watching unless you're in a very good mood , you know a lot about Danish actors and you have high tolerance for crap in celluloid form . Otherwise , avoid this like the plague it is . I give it a medium rating because it's not all poorly shot and it's not as bad as some other films I have seen .
451011	2093818	285761	5.0	Seriously , what is the rush ?	This is found on the original , single-disc release of X-Men . It's essentially some behind-the-scenes footage , interviews and clips from the film itself , bookended by poorly staged scenes of senators addressed by Kelly in regards to mutants . Davison performs . Unfortunately . . . oh , where to begin ? While the actual movie is paced well , this is in such a hurry to get on to the next thing ( so much so that it barely even stops pummeling you with information as the credits roll ) . It's all set to intense ( and at times , ridiculously bass-heavy , which wouldn't be as bad if this really was the Summer blockbuster pop-corn flick that several of these promotional things make it out to be ) music and flashes by unappealingly fast , occasionally even over-stylized to try to overemphasize the action in that which it advertises , blowing it all out of proportion ( it's really not that kind of movie ) , and in general just being straining to the viewer . . . everything but the material exclusively shot for this . The latter is quite simply painful to watch , due to below par acting , writing and production . Honestly , I come up short trying to think of sufficient reason to spend time on this . All of any worth herein was re-edited and more fully explored in specials so far superior to this that it's not even funny , on the later 1 . 5 version , which would be a much better addition to any fan's collection ( I'm not saying " go out and buy it " , I'm saying , if you're getting one or the other , I'd go for the recent of the two ) . The 2000 DVD does , in addition to this , hold deleted / extended scenes , and the ability to watch the film with them , an interview with Singer , Hugh Jackman's screen test , a couple of animatics , three trailers , a few TV spots and galleries . I recommend this only to completists , anyone else , if you didn't think that even 22 minutes could be wasted , this is likely to change your mind .
450862	2093818	98968	5.0	Not particularly good , but decent , for a TV-movie	I haven't seen the original film , that this one is a remake of , but I guess it's better than this . This film is based on a true story , but I don't know how true to the facts it is . The plot is pretty good , but terribly predictable , partly due to the fact that the whole film is being told as a flashback . It's also slow , especially for a 90-minute movie . The acting is mostly decent at best , with a few exceptions . Samantha Mathis was pretty good , and Peter Strauss was quite convincing . However , pretty much everyone else was overacted and hardly believable . R . Lee Ermey was somewhat good , but since this is the same role that he always plays , it was to be expected . The characters are somewhat well-written . The dialog is bad and pretty cliched . The film is fairly boring , and hard to sit through , mainly due to the predictability of the plot and the bad acting . It does have some good sequences , though , and is decent overall . Due to the various bad factors of the film , it has little to no re-watch value , and is not worth owning , even if you can get it for virtually nothing . I recommend it only to fans of thrillers , and only if it's on TV , and there's absolutely nothing worth watching for those 90 minutes .
450952	2093818	80707	5.0	Entertaining little vigilante action flick	This film starts out with a bang . . . literally . We see a huge explosion . Then one more . And another one . And yet another one . . . and this goes on for a while ; I don't know exactly how many explosions there are , just in the first two minutes , but the movie wastes no time , that's for sure . Then there are a few sequences of Vietnam , and soon thereafter , the real plot begins . As it did , I couldn't help but wonder : how many action films have an Vietnam vet ( short for veteran . . . obviously , as I doubt that there were many animals , and thereby veterinarians , in the Vietnam war ) as the hero , especially in the time right after the war ended . This is exceptionally violent , and the violence is almost disgustingly gratuitous . However , it's mostly also so over-the-top that it almost winds up having a comical effect . Regardless , no one who thinks they might be freaked out by the violence should see it . The plot is decent . A Vietnam vet snaps and starts killing a bunch of criminals systematically after his friend is attacked . He kills a very large amount of various criminals , half of them not having anything to do with his friend at all . I enjoyed the vigilante theme , and found it far more interesting than the usual Hollywood pretty-boy out to save the world from a terrorist from some country the American director can barely even pronounce . The acting is ridiculously bad . Only one actor , the one portraying the main character , can be said to give a decent performance . . . and even that's a stretch . The humor is decent . The action is pretty good , but the daft filming and editing manages to make several of the sequences seem dull . The cinematography and editing is unimaginative . The dialog is the typical 80's one-liner crap half of the time , and the rest of the dialog is either filler or something hinting at a point or a moral that never seems to appear . Overall , a decent 80's action exploitation flick . I recommend it to fans of 80's action films , but be warned that's it very violent .
449939	2093818	245943	5.0	A decent spoof of The Blair Witch Project	When reviewing this film , it's hard not to be at least a little biased ; there are people who love some of the hip-hop / rap artists in this film , and hate the rest , there are some who hate all of them ( and the entire rap music genre ) , and then there are the few who love all of them ( I guess , though I've never met anyone who loved all of them , especially since many of them hate each other ) . Let me say right now : I hate Vanilla Ice and Ja Rule , I have an enormous amount of respect and love for Eminem and his music , and most of the rest of these artists I am indifferent to ( several of them I don't even know ) . I did indeed want to see this film because I knew Eminem was in it , though not as much for his talent or my being a fan of his , as simply the fact that I knew that he can be incredibly funny , as I've seen a lot of interviews with him , and he also played a great funny character in The Wash with Dr . Dre and Snoop Dogg . And let me tell you right away , if you like Eminem's warped , funny sense of humor that we often see in interviews , you will like his performance in this film . He can really convince you that he believes what he's saying is true , no matter how bizarre it sounds . Many of the other rappers give half-decent witness statements , though a few were very bad and just took up screen time . Worst was probably Ja Rule and Vanilla Ice , in my opinion , but then again , that might just be because I hate them . The " main characters " of the film have unbelievably little screen time , actually , and are probably only there to make fun of the original group of morons from the original Blair Witch film . They only have one really funny scene , and then a scene at the end that obviously makes fun of a similar scene in the original Blair Witch , and apart from those two , I'd guess they have two or three other scenes , that might have one or two good jokes in total , while the rest , like several other things in this film , merely take up screen time . What's funny about this film is , even though there seemed to be so many low points and pointless scenes , I never really felt like turning it off , or leaving the room to do something more fulfilling , like I seriously considered with the original Blair Witch film . Maybe it was just to see the next hilarious Eminem sequence , but something definitely kept me glued to my seat throughout the entire runtime . A lot of the jokes in the film are based on what the viewer knows about hip-hop and ghettos , not to mention black slang , which definitely limits the audience of the film , though I would say that the title can't throw too many people off . This is a spoof of The Blair Witch Project , that revolves around various hip-hop stars . The plot is fairly incoherent and all over the place , though I think that's the point . Don't expect some huge plot twist or to be told a great story . It's basically some hip-hop artists making fun of the basic premise of the film , a witch hunting hip-hop artists . The acting is hard to comment on , I wonder if it's supposed to look as lame and bad as it does , which I'm pretty sure that it is . The characters are also all over the place , with only a few of them being part of the actual story ( apart from , of course , the hip-hop artists themselves ) , and even fewer of them have enough screen time for us to actually recognize them , in the next scene they're in ( but maybe that's just me ) . All in all , a decent film if you're a fan of hip-hop and you just want to have a good laugh that's mostly on The Blair Witch Project's expense , but not something I would recommend too many people to watch , as many will hate it ( It appears that most who've seen it already do ) . I recommend it to huge fans of one or more of the hip-hop artists , or just people who'll go to great lengths to laugh at and mock The Blair Witch Project . Not something you want to spend too much money on ( I got it as a gift , thankfully ) .
450596	2093818	203941	5.0	Average at best	I didn't really care for this mystery-thriller at all . . . it barely has anything that gives the viewer a good reason to watch it . The ending scene has a little intensity , but it is badly filmed , as is the rest of the film , so the small amount of intensity there is , is lost in bad cuts and lousy camera work . Apart from the ending , the only feasible reason to see it is the mystery and the humor . The film does have a decent amount of humor , but humor can only make up for so much bad acting , boring plot , and dull film . The mystery is OK , it did have me guessing until the very end , but it just seems like a lazy attempt at making a " family " slasher film , by having someone die on a regular basis . Unfortunately , the family part shines through far more than the slasher does , so all of the kills , and I do mean all of them , are off-screen and barely detailed at all , to keep it safe for the kids , too . What in the world were they thinking ? Why would kids watch this , why would the family sit down and watch this ? There are plenty of other , better family oriented films out there , why ruin what little potential this one had as an teenage / adult film . Had this been R-rated , it would have been much more interesting . I know that this is a remake , and that there are two films made earlier with virtually the same plot as this , so , if you're reading this , and you can't figure out which one of the three to choose , take my advice : take the second movie , from ' 75 , or , better yet , take the original , from ' 46 . I haven't seen either but I can almost guarantee that they are better than this . I can't really imagine them being much worse , actually . I recommend this only to huge fans of mystery-thrillers , as it is definitely not among the best in the genre . At best , it's average , but maybe that's enough for big fans .
450174	2093818	132910	5.0	There's a new bird in town . . . it's remarkably similar , though unlike it's predecessor , its quality doesn't quite soar	I watched this before the original The Crow . In fact , I'm not sure I realized that this was part of a series , much less the third part . Now , having watched the original ( I have not seen the second movie ) , comparisons are unavoidable , and they are , I'm afraid , entirely and mercilessly unfavorable . This " gets " rather little from the first at all , and even less of it gets done right . There are attempts for the tone , but in spite of introducing new perverted enemies for the undead bird to seek out and combat , it just doesn't have the impact of the first . The language and nudity is present , but that's hardly what made the first excellent . The style . . . I don't know , it tries . More often than not , the film comes off as silly ( unintentionally , I'd wager ) . The plot could have been better , and it seems like there was at least one point where they go for demystifying some of the supernatural elements ( fantasy is by no means a genre I venture into often , much less enjoy , but in the original , it definitely worked ) . The powers may have also been altered . The pacing is reasonable , I guess . The acting is usually unimpressive , except for perhaps moments by the two leads . The music isn't bad , mostly rock , and dark in mood , fitting . I wouldn't exactly put up much of a fight if someone tried to sell me the soundtrack . The action has some to offer , as well ( if it gets terribly overblown and overdone at parts , in its attempts to outdo the first film ) , though I can't claim that it'll stay in your memory for long ( and , come on , if we're going to watch a young man fight , are we going to choose Eric Mabius over Brandon Lee any day of the week , on a dare , to win a bet and / or any other reason ? I refer you to Will Smith's oft-used catch-phrase of many of his movies for an answer ( hint : it's the one where he uses a word that refers to downstairs , and no , I'm not talking about a basement ) . The effects are good . The movie is shot and edited fine , if there aren't really any ground-breaking moments . A lot of this seems almost remade from the first , just lacking what made that film great . Gone is the poetic justice . Images , events and the basic structure of the film are recycled from the first , almost to the point where you start to wonder if these film-makers actually had or even thought they had anything to actually contribute to the franchise , or if they just saw a cash cow , grabbed a teet each and squeezed , as hard as they could . Actual fans of The Crow should steer clear of this . If all you want is a revenge flick , and you either don't mind or prefer them with some touch of fantasy and / or the supernatural , knock yourself out . I recommend this to those who find themselves in the latter group ( I've got no problem with people in said group . . . I just want to make it clear who are likely to enjoy the film ) .
450214	2093818	369281	5.0	Just barely watchable for non-fans	Before I saw this , I thought it wouldn't matter much if I didn't know the characters beforehand . I was wrong . I could barely follow the story , which annoyed me , since it was so simple that it hurts . The plot is OK , but unless you're a fan of Bionicle , you won't really care about it ; it spends too little time telling us who these characters are , or giving us reasons to like them , or care for them . I realize that this is a children's movie , but it should have been better ; most Disney movies give you characters to care about . The acting varied from decent to very bad . The characters were OK , but too many of them seemed to be there just for the sake of comic relief ( on a side-note , why did one of the Toa's talk like Yoda ? ) . The CGI is mostly OK , but at times it descends into mediocrity . Something I found repetitively annoying was how the animators kept trying to give these characters with barely any facial features at all emotion ; it just doesn't work , when the eyes are lights and the face is a metal surface . Light and metal can't convey emotions like human actors can . They should have realized that , and put more action in it instead . With all that said , the action was the most entertaining thing in this movie , especially the fight at the end . Apart from that , this movie has very little to offer to non-fans of Bionicle , and if you get around to watching this , you'll be happy that it's only 70 minutes , because you won't be able to sit through any more of it when it's done .
450973	2093818	391214	5.0	Makes for a good watch , once or twice	After buying the collectors edition of From Dusk Till Dawn ( mainly to see Full Tilt Boogie , which was also featured in it ) , I saw this nice little documentary . It has some very good interview bits with the various actors and crew-members , but all in all , it's mainly just the actors and crew-members expressing their opinions about Tarantino and Rodriguez , which isn't something everyone cares about ; it has little to no information about the actual process of film-making ( which I suppose Full Tilt Boogie has ) , but I enjoyed it . It was fun to hear the various actors talking about Rodriguez and Tarantino , and there are a few bits where the director and writers family members ( Tarantino's mother and Rodriguez ' sister ) talked about them as well . Not much else to put here , but I suppose I could write a fun little piece of trivia about the collectors edition DVD ; it features two music videos , ZZ Top with She's Just Killing Me and Tito And The Tarantulas with After Dark . Both videos were directed and edited by Rodriguez . I thought that was kind of funny ( partly because he wasn't contractually obliged to do them , which means he just did them , probably for fun ) . They are good , by the way . Both feature immense amounts of Salma Hayek , so most guys will probably enjoy them . All in all , I give this documentary a . Good for a watch or two .
450067	2093818	119304	5.0	Switches to much back and forth between romantic and black comedy	I don't know what exactly went wrong with this film ; I guess they wanted to make a comedy , and they couldn't figure out whether to make it a romantic comedy or a black comedy . It could perhaps have been both , but that would require for it to start out as both . It starts out only as a black comedy , and the romance just surfaces from out of nowhere about half an hour into the film . Romance can add to a film , but with some black comedies ( including this one ) the plot is too far-fetched for you to really care about the characters , and romance in a movie is empty if you have no one to care for . What's left is just some unoriginal black comedy gags that seem worn out ; people who should care about the dead guy but don't , the guy talking sense being mistaken as the crazy one , the ceremony that should be silent and holy , but is constantly interrupted . . . I could go on . We've seen it all before , often done better than here . The plot , while being extremely far-fetched , is fairly original ( as far as I know ) and it does allow for at least a few funny scenes . Too many of them just seem recycled . The acting is not bad , in fact it's better than what the script is worth . The script is fairly badly written , especially with the randomly thrown-in romance . Many of the characters seem like stereotypical cliches too . All in all , the film could have been far better , had the plot been more believable , the romance better worked in , the script better written , the material more original and the film overall less predictable . It has its moments , but it fails to entertain throughout the runtime , which it should be able to , as it's only 90 minutes . It does have a few pretty good laughs though . It's just barely entertaining enough to sit through , and it's not the worst way to spend an hour and a half , if you've got absolutely nothing better to do .
450999	2093818	467197	5.0	For some , this will have a bunch going for it	I've played both VG's , several times through , and I enjoy them . I don't think many are going to argue that this has a lot of atmosphere , almost every moment of it , and builds mood , often rather well . There are a couple of real nice visuals in this , and the overall look and feel is achieved almost invariably successfully . That's , unfortunately , most of the positive . Before I get into the negative , let me tell you , if you dig the original , 2001 game , you are in for a treat here , the references , the things they got right , they really hit the nail on the head with . Obviously that isn't going to count for anything to those not going in with such in mind , so I'll also say that select pieces of the action , especially near the end , were very cool . There isn't much of it , though , in this , which really stands in stark contrast to its source , which has received comments about having too little varying play , in that it was almost entirely based on shooting ( and the moves ) . I'm afraid that's brought me to the bad . . . this is merely the sum of its elements . Overuse of effects occurs . . . the first time we see a flickering light , it's good , but it gets excessive , if not that strongly . It also seems very intent on both telling us that it has a high production value ( which it does , no doubt ) , and I'm not sure all the suggestive material was there for any other reason than attracting young people , and one can question whether it should really be in something like this . On that , Kunis is too young for the part , and she does not have the femme fatale thing going on . Wahlberg is closer in age to his role , and he does brooding reasonably well . But let me get back to where I was just headed . . . does this fit in the genre that what it comes from does ? Max Payne , both when we saw him in ' 01 and when we rejoined him in ' 03 , was a mix of film noir , John Woo movies and a dash of The Matrix . That can't really be said about this . Bullet-time is featured , but only barely at all , and seldom that impressive . The tone is dark , bordering on drab once or twice , and at least one downright tasteless sequence , that I'm also not sure was meant to have the overtones it wound up with . There are a handful of attempts ( that I imagine few will laugh at ) at comedy , but no actual humor . Not all of it is thought through , and characters get exposition-happy some . The acting tends to be average or better . This isn't without dramatic moments , and actually has a different and interesting take on certain aspects of the story , which they actually translated relatively well to the silver screen . The CGI is quite excellent . The style is noteworthy , if limited ( perhaps intentionally so ) . And anyone who thinks Nolasco can only ever be the sympathetic Sucre , well , just hold off on judging that until you see this . Sound has something to bring to the table , and music , as well . Pacing may not be flawless , but I can't claim that I was ever bored watching this . The cinematography and editing have stuff to offer , if not devoid of odd choices . You can tell this was PG-13 , at times . The language isn't pervasive , and harsher is found elsewhere . I recommend this to fans of the interactive efforts involving of the same title , and those intrigued . . . albeit I would advise that you keep an open mind , the former group to a greater extent than the latter ( who , honestly , will probably get less out of this ) .
450497	2093818	119395	5.0	We don't need to make fun of Hollywood and its movies . . . they both do that just fine by themselves	I suppose this one is just easier to enjoy if you know nothing about the original version , and / or the novel from whence that film came . I say " that " , and not " these " , because beyond the title ( which , it should be noted , Fred Zimmerman , R . I . P . , the director of the 1973 version , fought to change on this one ) , the movies have fairly little in common ( I wouldn't know about the book , I haven't read it ) . Instead of relying on the tastes of the audience , and the memorable writing , this Hollywoodizes the entire thing ; it gets " personal " , the lead characters are more clear ( in stark contrast to the " presenting " nature of the original , Day of the Jackal , more like a documentary than something for / on the silver screen ) , subtlety tends to go out the window , and of course everything is " bigger " . Several scenes are remade from " Day " , with some exaggeration and such , to the point where it , at times , resembles parody , presumably not intentionally so . . . and I am not the first to point this out . This is more action-oriented than " Day " , which is not to say it's entirely devoid of interesting elements ( there are just few of them which aren't found in " Day " , and more well-done , there ) . Music and script is about what you'd expect , and hey , there are worse of this kind out there . Acting varies , this gets its share of attempts at accents and lesser performers . Direction , well , it's not particularly bad , but do note that the guy went on to do the second Basic Instinct , which I've not seen , but from what I hear , it's clearly just a recent sequel of the sort that not so much " just doesn't live up to the first " as " destroys some of what the first carefully and skillfully built up and / or developed " , which , even just planting himself in the director's chair for would indicate that he does not get that fact , that he does not care , or that he simply needed money that bad , and none of the options are conducive to commanding respect as a serious and intelligent director . Not necessarily awful , suffers from the unavoidable comparison to a far superior piece of cinema , which it could have easily steered clear of by merely eliminating the similar situations and , you know , calling it something else . I recommend this to fans of action as done by Hollywood , and only the fans of Day of the Jackal , book or celluloid , who want a send-up of the material .
450180	2093818	293564	5.0	This time , it's personal . . . and kinda dumb . . . and really clichéd	I caught this on a plane , as one of the in-flight movies . This was basically the one that made me feel the least amount of strong repulsion , of all the available choices , so I endured the 90 minutes , with some pretty scattered enjoyment . There are some funny things . . . the scene in the dojo isn't all bad . Mostly , the humor didn't really work , at least for me , though . Tucker seems to be growing more irritating as time goes on , and his character seems to have gotten somewhat incompetent . . . in the first film ( I haven't seen the second ) , he was a good cop , unorthodox , and not necessarily popular , but he didn't come off as inept as he did in this . I'm not sure anyone should have to be subjected to the " singing " of either lead . The action has its moments , and there is surely plenty of it . . . even though , as far as recent over-the-top fast-paced action flicks have gone in recent years , since at least the early 2000's , this isn't as ridiculously overwhelming as others . Some of the action clichés , and to a larger extent , clichés in general , are noticeably present . By the time that almost half a dozen instances of characters being endangered by the same basic thing take place in the same scene , in a matter of minutes . . . well , if you don't already dislike the movie by that point , I suppose you may forgive the film that . A previously seen character returns to the franchise , quite possibly the last one we wanted to see again . The film seems to supply as much sexual content and nudity as they could and still get away with a PG-13 rating , and most , if not all , of it is utterly gratuitous , with the only purpose being to attract heterosexual males , and young ones , at that . The plot is obvious and predictable , and sacrifices any kind of sense for the sake of action or comedy ( neither of which are all that strong , for that matter ) more often than not . The cinematography and editing break absolutely no conventions , and both have moments that are downright bad . The acting is essentially unimpressive . The film manages to waste both von Sydow and Baker Hall . The characters don't really possess any charm they might once have had . The one attempt the film makes to stir up emotion fails so miserably , it's not even funny . . . it's almost a parody of scenes like it . This may manage to offend every single race and nationality featured . I guess if you can borrow it from a friend , avoid having to pay , it'll do . I recommend this to fans of the actors , Ratner and / or the franchise .
449910	2093818	465494	5.0	Sneaks onto the movie scene , misses the mark somewhat , and may die as fast as a target in one of the games	There are going to be two distinct groups that this will / may appeal to ; the fans of the video-game , and your average action fan ( or fans of average action ) . I fit into both . However , the problem is that those in the first group may very well find this as ultimately unsatisfying as I did ( which is not to say I was not entertained , or regret my viewing , on the opening night , here in Denmark ) , and that those in the second , honestly , could do an awful lot better . I've heard this described as Bourne light , and those who are familiar with both characters , even superficially , will know how wrong that is . As far as the action fans go , the action just doesn't work as well as other efforts ( though there are some fairly cool moments in there ) , and not that much of it is particularly memorable , though most of it seems to try , and want , to be . It's shot fine , though there is occasional confusion , and in at least one sequence , it was downright difficult to tell what was happening . The physical fights are somewhat ineffective , with so-so choreography and very obviously overdone sounds ( I would guess they were trying to make it " bigger " , which makes sense to do , but the execution , pardon the pun , needed serious work ) . One thing , that really hits any viewer of this film , is just how little coverage there is of the background . The trailer describes what may be the intended background for the film . . . but if you haven't seen that , you might not know much of it , because hardly any of it is present in the film . Guys , a hint ; if you're going on " people know it from the video game " , you sorta have to actually use the same background . Apart from the bar-code , the baldness and the . . . ( wait , that's actually it ) , the background really isn't that of the games . That is acceptable ( if it does rob the character of his most interesting qualities ) , my complaint goes to the lack of detail and explanation in the film . There's a difference between mystery and simply not sharing information . Now , to those who are fans of the games , some of which may very well have desired a movie for close to a decade ( be careful what you wish for ) . On the plus side , they did get some stuff right . They did not ruin the look by trying to give 47 hair , and the bar-coded baldy actually somehow fits in the film's universe , not seeming out of place . He wears his trademark suit . He does seem to prefer his good old Silverballers , and the ever-recognizable symbol that's been with the games from the beginning ( which , together with the suit , may be one of the things to change the least , through the four games ) . There're a reasonable number of nods to the games , and those of us who've been fans for years will recognize many things . Unfortunately , there is also bad . . . perhaps the biggest issue being Nika . From the first time I watched the trailer , I knew about her being in the film , and I had the feeling right away that it was . . . not good . Her inclusion makes this even more Bourne light , and , frankly , she doesn't do a thing in the entire film . She was added to give the young males something to look at , and to an extent , add emotion to forty-seven ( but really more the first ) . I would have had no problem if she had been added for a meaningful purpose , but when she spends most of her time setting up the title character's " I'm such a bad-ass " ( which he is , but we don't need it shoved down our throats ) lines , and / or walking around with little to no clothing on . . . it just doesn't belong here . It could be argued that they took the name , the popular title , and turned it into mindless action . The character's personality . . . he talks too much , even to the point of having one-liners . I would have liked more facial expression and body language . His awkwardness towards women is straight out of the games , but it did not work anywhere near as well as it did there , and it's not used well , if at all , here . The casting of Olyphant has both good and bad to it . He fits , more or less , the physical ( I am not kidding you , I might not have watched this at all , had Diesel actually starred . . . my dislike of him notwithstanding , he is not 47 ! He's a big muscular guy ) type , and his eyes and some mannerisms / movements do fit , somewhat . But I don't know if Tim has the range , or if he understands the character . Hit-man is perfectly capable of talking , but he only really does it when it's necessary . The film didn't have enough of the subtlety ( though it did have some , and it was pretty good ) found in the games , focusing far more on him killing groups of people , guns blazing , which , while possible in the games , is something that is a lot less beneficial and encouraged , throughout them . The pacing seems in a hurry , hence the lack of these sequences . There is some build-up , however , and I would say that at least one thing does pay off . . . however , almost all of it , well , just doesn't . The plot is rather messy and self-contradictory , considering how simple it is . The acting is decent . Ulrich Thomsen has done better . Scott has or uses an accent that , to me , was quite distracting . Robert Knepper isn't too bad . Cusick , whom I do like , doesn't look , sound , or in any other way , really fit the character he plays , not even the nationality . The dialog is not really memorable , and seldom very good . The tone can be crude , unnecessarily . One could have hoped for a more sophisticated , stylish ( when this attempts to be that , which fortunately is not often , it fails ) approach , more in line with the games . All in all , don't expect the greatness of the games , but you could do worse . I recommend this to fans of action-flicks ( not really fans of the games ) .
450077	2093818	121765	5.0	The worst in the series ?	Yes , of all six . At this point , nothing ( or infinitely , insignificantly little ) remains " real " in these movies . That , in itself , doesn't have to be a problem . But we can tell . It doesn't feel right . Sin City doesn't have this problem , nor does 300 . The effects are , technically speaking , amazing , but nothing else in this really goes beyond being " decent " . The romance lacks credibility ( and yes , I am aware that some of it was left on the cutting room floor , but we're going by the finished product , not the intent ) . The overall story . . . well , Lucas gives many fans something they may have wanted in spite of there being absolutely no basis for it , and sacrifices it making sense in doing so . This tries too hard to tie in with the OT ( which , I should point out so that no one mistakes me for someone who grew up with it , I didn't attentively view until Episode I was out ) . The dialog gets to be downright painful , with one even contradicting something in the first ( written by the same guy , a few years earlier . . . ! ) . The plot isn't that engaging , and things that ought to be in the next are here ( and vice versa ) . The pacing is reasonable . The light-saber bits could be considerably better ( they are particularly unimpressive compared to Phantom Menace ) , and at times , it's the tamest it's been since Return , although it isn't all bad . The action in general , mostly , it's just overdone , and goes on for too long . There are cool ideas and concepts , but their lackluster execution results in them merely being unable to be used soon by more talented film-makers . The title could be that of a 50's schlocky sci-fi flick . The battles do have notable , interesting aspects . . . in the editing and cinematography , mainly . The actors have put in solid performances elsewhere , or , at least , less embarrassing ones . Characters could stand improvement , and , you know , consistency . The score is still good . The DVD holds over a dozen ( not all more than minutes long ) featurettes , deleted scenes , trailers , TV-spots and a commentary . I recommend this exclusively to those who must watch all of Star Wars .
450011	2093818	117011	5.0	The same Damme thing	First of all , I'd like to apologize for the very bad pun I put in the one line summary , but it's late , and I swear , it sounded much better in my head . However , it is fairly accurate ; the film is exactly like every other movie Van Damme has done . The lame one-liners , the cliché dialog , the stereotype characters , the decent-at-best action . . . I was honestly barely paying attention to this film , partly because I had seen it before , once , and couldn't remember if it was good or not ( believe me , had I remembered it , I never would have watched it ) , but mainly because every time I did pay attention I almost instantly wound up mocking and laughing at what went on on-screen . It's just so typical and by-the-numbers that it's ridiculous . Every single action scene involved stuff that we've seen before ( and more than enough of ) , every line of dialog tried to be clever but wound up being embarrassing , each of the " cool " villains were just too damn stereotypical and the whole thing was so preposterous and predictable that it was laughable rather than anything else . The plot is predictable and poorly paced . It's about . . . uh , Van Damme # 1 gets killed , Van Damme # 2 finds out # 1 existed , some tame unrealistic fighting ensues , Van Damme breaks bones with the ease that only he and Steven Seagal can manage . . . eh , something else happens . . . like I said , I wasn't really paying very much attention to it . The one good thing I can say about this , and a lot of people will probably crucify me for saying this , but I have to say it ; Natasha Henstridge looks hot as hell in this film , and if you are ever forced to watch this for whatever reason , or you find yourself being half bored by the film , stay awake for the sole reason of seeing her getting her freak on . . . the one bad thing about is that Damme is there too , but that is tolerable to see Natasha like that . If you're having trouble sitting through it , think of Natasha , look forward to the scene , or , even better , do what I did ; laugh . Laugh at every single cliché-like and stereotypical thing that happens in the movie . That'll take you through it . What else is there to say . . . cinematography is uninspired , dialog is badly written , action is tiresome and not particularly well-choreographed , acting is decent , characters are cliché-like and stereotypical with not one shred of personality or development . What can I say ; a decent at best typical Van Damme movie . I recommend it to fans of Jean-Claude Van Damme and anyone who are willing to sit through about 100 minutes of bad action flick to see Natasha Henstridge naked .
450936	2093818	89841	6.0	With that cast , that direction and that idea , this could have been an excellent film . . . had it just made up its mind on what it wanted to be	Comedy ? Not really . Drama ? Little , if any . Tragicomedy ? Possibly , some , but not developed as such . The plot is too complicated for its own good . The pacing is much , much too slow . The acting is quite solid all-round , but that is , unfortunately , not enough to save the film . The action is daft . The tension is low and both poorly built and utilized . The characters . . . I could not get behind anyone's motivation . Also , to quote Team America : World Police ( more specifically , the character of Kim Jong Il ( who I understand is quite a " character " for real , as well ) ) " Why is everyone so fing stupid ? ! " To be honest , it's mainly the mobsters . Why ? I " get " wanting to make gangsters look dumb and inept , but . . . you might want to check the level of reality at some point , too . Or make sure you have your audience check their brains at the door . This started out almost poetically . . . slow , building . . . beautiful images . Then it starts trying to be funny . Much of it is dark comedy , but very little of it actually works . Not long after , it starts trying to be dramatic . . . here , it fails even more-so . With Nicholson being painfully dimwitted and Turner being fairly . . . easy , slutty , it's just difficult to find reason to sympathize with these people ( and let's not even mention the notion of liking them ) . I doubt there's a single credible character in there . I think what takes the cake here , though , is the ending . . . or , rather , lack thereof . Please , anyone who's seen this , let's be honest ; this movie doesn't " end " , it just stops . The words " The End " fade onto the screen , followed by the credits , but there's no real closure ( not to mention , it came across as tacked-on ) . To the story , to the characters , to the plot . I recommend this to only the biggest fans of the people involved in making it , and urge most anyone else to just skip this one . . . it's no great loss . The loss is the great chance that was wasted in the production of this film . . . with an interesting premise ( later made into a Hollywood flick that manages to be more entertaining than this ) , a ( or so I've heard , this is the first of his films I watch ) competent director and a highly talented cast , this could have been simply breathtaking . Instead , it's rather moan-inducing . Sad .
450037	2093818	200550	6.0	Just another teen movie	This is your typical teen movie , with the addition of some hot girls dancing on top of a bar . The premise is not really interesting , and the plot is extremely predictable . The only reason guys would want to see this is because of the girls dancing on the bar , and who can blame us ; apart from one or two decent humorous lines , the hot girls are the only thing the movie has going for it . Something I truly loathed was the amount of annoying pop music , that almost kept me from sitting through it . It isn't exactly as bad as some of the truly bad teen movies ( read : Crossroads ) , but it's definitely no masterpiece . Most guys will probably watch it just to see the girls dancing , but the good thing is that they can watch it with their girlfriends , since it does feature a lot of girlie stuff . So watch it with your girlfriend , and you'll probably both like some parts of it ; it's not as horrible to sit through as the truly bad teen movies ( read : Crossroads ) , but it does take some effort . On the other hand , pretty much any guy should see this just for watching Tyra Banks pouring water down her chest .
449809	2093818	119975	6.0	Pretty good , for a made-for-TV horror film	I'll start this review by saying that I've read neither of the short stories that this movie is based on , neither Stephen King's Chattery Teeth , nor Cliver Barker's The Body Politic , so I can't comment on whether or not they're accurate conversions of the stories . I will say , however , that based on my limited knowledge of King's work ( and my even more limited knowledge of Barker's ) that I do believe that they did a pretty good job on bringing the stories to life in this movie . The plot for both stories is good ( yes , even the King story , I have to admit , though I despise his works ) , and it's both involving and interesting , for both segments . The acting ranges from made-for-TV standard , and slightly better ; all four of the leads did a good job , as far as I'm concerned : Christopher Lloyd , Matt Frewer , Raphael Sbarge and Missy Crider . I especially enjoyed Lloyd , and his character , the storyteller , who is in both the prologue and the epilogue for both segments , and gives a further chill down the spine with his afterthoughts for both stories . The characters are well-written , credible and easy to relate to , which , I guess , can be credited almost as much to the original authors ( King and Barker ) as the script writer and director ( who , incidentally , is the same person ) . Both segments are about equally chilling and horrifying , though the first has more buildup and the second has more actual action , which shows the difference in the authors ' styles . The direction is pretty good , especially for a TV movie . The special effects are about as good as they get for a TV movie budget . The horror in both segments is fairly chilling and disturbing . They also both give you a little something to think about , once the story is over ; this is also pushed a little further in the epilogue for both segments , by the storyteller , Lloyd , which obviously proves that the director / scriptwriter Mick Garris certainly understood both stories , as well as their underlying themes . All in all , a pretty good way to spend 90 minutes if it's on TV and you've got nothing spectacular to do , but not something you'll be watching over and over again . Good for one or two viewings , if you're into this type of horror . I recommend it to fans of King , Barker and Lloyd , and possibly also Garris . Good for spending 90 minutes watching if it's on , and you've got nothing better to do .
450387	2093818	111143	6.0	One of those films that you either reject or embrace	For a comic book movie ( which this definitely is to some extent ) this is fairly good , though it is beaten by films made both earlier and later ; films like Batman from ' 89 , or Hellboy from ' 04 , and many more . This is what defeats it , coupled with the fact that it definitely won't meet everyone's expectations nor will it fit everyone's taste . It's dark and moody , and has a great deal of atmosphere , and this is what makes the film enjoyable . It also does present a somewhat realistic hero , by giving him a gigantic network of agents operating all around the world , the ability to use telepathy to hide his existence and his true identity , and his invisibility . I found him to be a fairly interesting and exciting hero , but I know that not all will . I can imagine many also will be unhappy with the fact that the film takes place in a time far from our own , and in the past rather than the future . It takes place in and around the 1930's , and it does present a pretty believable vision of that time . The plot is good , not to say great , and moves along at a good pace . It's not too fast , but not too slow , either . The acting ranges , but it's mostly good , if not great . I found most of the main characters to be quite well-acted and credible . Alec Baldwin , John Lone , Penelope Ann Miller , Peter Boyle , Ian McKellen and Tim Curry . . . all did pretty good jobs . I have to say , Baldwin and Curry gave the best performances , in my opinion . The characters are well-written and credible ; I especially liked Shiwan Khan , who was without a doubt a very worthy adversary of The Shadow . The special effects ( especially the CGI ) is not very impressive by todays standards , but it looks good enough , and it does the job it's supposed to . The action sequences were fairly good , though of course it can't compare to the standard of comic book movies of today . The problem with this movie , apart from everything I've already stated , is that it feels a little too Hollywood ; the sub-plot about the love interest , the climax , some of the dialog . . . it's good , you know , but it just feels a little too mainstream to be great . All in all , a great movie , about a somewhat believable hero . Too bad a sequel probably won't happen , as this did have potential to be a great franchise . I recommend it to fans of comic book movies , and possibly fans of the other The Shadow material ( the magazine , the TV series , the movie from ' 37 , and possibly even the radio shows ) . Fans of the actors or general fans of the main genres might also want to check it out .
450021	2093818	309369	6.0	I didn't find it all that funny , but others might	It's really no secret that I honestly don't particularly care for Steve Oedekerk . I don't like what he did to the few Jim Carrey films he was involved in ( one of them even being a sequel , and Carrey seldom does those at all . . . and that one followed a genuinely funny movie , to boot ) , and I hardly ever find his material funny . I will admit up front that I am really not in the intended audience for this short . That may be part of why I didn't enjoy it as much as others have ( and I am in no way trying to keep those who do , will or may enjoy this from watching it ) . The film seems to be typical to what Oedekerk makes . . . if you like his other work , you may very well enjoy it . There are a few bodily function jokes , and more often than not , his writing makes fun of itself . At least one joke fits both of the aforementioned criteria . Some of the material is clever . The scenes spoof the original movie ( which I could not stand ) well . The whole thing is , as the other thumb films ( apparently , this is the only one I've watched ) , acted out by thumbs ( yup ) with moving eyes and a mouth each . That is actually quite nicely done , and works throughout the almost half-hour run-time . The pacing isn't bad . I didn't hate this , but I'm not sure I'd ever watch it again . I recommend it to fans of Steve Oedekerk , his body of work and people who enjoy his style of humor .
449920	2093818	280486	6.0	Typical Schumacher production ; decent for a single viewing	Joel Schumacher . . . a director with a pretty bad reputation among audiences , partly due to him ( from the opinions of the fans of the franchise ) ruining the Batman franchise , which Tim Burton had done such a good job of resurrecting / building . Many think he's an awful director , but the fact is that he's efficient , fast and cheap . He gets his movies done fast and on a reasonably low budget , compared to many other Hollywood directors . Personally , I find him to be a fairly talentless director , but I haven't seen Phone Booth ( which I've heard many great things about ) , and some claim that his movies are underrated . So here he teams up with Jerry Bruckheimer , the famous Hollywood big-time executive producer who has made tons of newer action flicks , and puts Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins together in a buddy-comedy-action-flick about spies . There's no doubt about it ; the film is fairly typical Bruckheimer action flick , and it doesn't have a lot to offer , that we haven't seen before , often better . But I think Rock and Hopkins make a good " odd couple " , and they have pretty good chemistry . The plot is pretty tame and typical , and it tries to keep itself interesting by throwing in a bunch of twists . The pacing is decent , and it's possible to sit attentively through the film , once , provided that you like either Hopkins or Rock ( or both ) enough , and enjoy this type of films . The acting is good enough . The characters are diverse , credible and well-written enough . The action is pretty good , Hopkins has some cool scenes . The humor is good , Rock and Hopkins have some great moments together . The dialog is good , especially between Rock and Hopkins . They play characters exactly like what we've seen from them before , and it works pretty good . All in all , a decent but entirely by-the-numbers action-comedy flick , good for a single viewing for fans of the people involved in the production of the film . I recommend it to big fans of Rock and Hopkins , and possibly Schumacher and Bruckheimer as well .
450914	2093818	371396	6.0	Decent	This is a featurette found on the DVD for The Matrix , as well as on one of the 10 discs in the Ultimate release . It consists of behind-the-scenes footage , test material , animatics and an interview . John Gaeta , the man behind the technology , explains . . . throughout this . . . and thus answers the question posed in the title . It's not bad , and the information is interesting , it's just perhaps not the most gripping way to tell it . The method is described , and we do get good insight into how it works and the way they do it , the photography and all . For being so short . . . six minutes . . . it does hold a fair amount . The editing is fine . Pacing is unimpressive . This breaks no new ground , and has nothing to offer anyone who doesn't specifically wish to find out more about this particular subject . This doesn't necessarily give anything in the film away ( the first one , obviously , what with the year on this ) , and it doesn't hold anything objectionable , the strongest is images of bullets hitting , of which there is slim to nil in this . I recommend this to anyone who wants to know about Bullet-Time , and maybe fans of the franchise .
450617	2093818	164221	6.0	Not a masterpiece , but sufficiently entertaining	I'm quite a big fan of the typical British humor , I find it a lot more sophisticated than the typical American humor . If you're into British humor , you'll definitely enjoy at least some part of this , as it's packed with it . Some of it is basic , and some of it is wacky , but most of it is good . It deals with a lot of the questions and stuff guys and girls have with having sex as a teenager . The plot is nowhere near realistic , nor very interesting , but it has it's moments , and the humor is worth sitting through the movie for . At the very beginning , the movie was at it's funniest , and after that , it gets slower and less funny , at a continuous downwards loop . . . unfortunately . But , it has some incredibly funny moments at several points in the movie , so it's worth checking out , unless you can't stand British humor or the heavy British accent that every single person in the movie has . The movie could have been great , if it wasn't for a few slow scenes , and some gags that don't have the funny effect they're supposed to have , but you should check it out if you're into British humor , or just plain sexual humor .
450047	2093818	768136	6.0	Nothing special , but not bad	First off , this should not be watched by anyone who hasn't already seen the film , unless they don't care about spoilers . I'm not sure the film will hold any surprises whatsoever if you see it after this . As far as behind-the-scenes featurettes and such go , this is informational enough . It has interviews with various people who worked on it , and a handful of special effects in the film are briefly explained in adequate detail by the people who created them . A few tidbits of info are divulged , including how locations were found and where . Interviews with the actors are also featured in this . The pacing isn't bad , and the short running time was a good choice . It isn't terribly entertaining . The editing breaks no boundaries . This and the other featurette ( On the Set - The Making of The Forgotten ) featured on the DVD of The Forgotten are fine , and fans may want to check them out . The commentary track of the film may be worth a listen to those interested in info , as well . For anyone who wants to interpret the film to be anything other than exactly what is presented : you may not want to watch this . No mention is made of even the possibility of the movie being about anything but what it , itself , ends up saying it is . I'm not sure anyone who didn't love the film would find anything in this particularly interesting , unless they deem it so from reading this review . The special effects talk isn't bad , and the interviews are OK . I recommend this to fans of the film , except for those who want it to be about something other than what it claims it is .
450783	2093818	398712	7.0	Not the original , but a solid 98 minutes	This has nowhere near the same level of tension as Carpenter's ( just to clear things up , for those of you who haven't read my review of that , I have not seen Rio Bravo , which I understand that both are based upon ) , but I don't get the impression that that was what they were going for . Why try to beat the man at his own game ? Instead , they went in a different direction , and it works . Some scenes and bits from the ' 76 version are redone or referenced , and it's not bad . The basic concept is also reused , but beyond that , they rewrote it almost entirely . More time is spent on characters in this one , and they are all well-written , credible and interesting . Leguizamo is ( and , it seems , has ) an awful lot of fun in this . The acting in general is great ( perhaps not for Ja , but . . . was anyone expecting more of him in this kind of thing ? ) . The dialog is almost entirely invariably ( save for a little bit of repetitive material ) excellent , with many cool and clever lines . The action is marvelous , at times breaking into being purely awesome . It's violent and graphic , and rather immensely entertaining . The tone is gritty . The plot develops nicely throughout . The pacing is good . Realism is fairly high . Richet seems to " get " the environment . Effects are exceptionally well-done . The music is fitting , and marvelous , rap and the like . Editing and cinematography are masterful and effective . The hand-held is a very positive surprise . There is a continued stream of language , much of which is strong . The DVD holds well-done featurettes going into detail about aspects such as stunts , guns and set design , deleted scenes with words by Jean-Francois , and a commentary track ( which makes for an enjoyable and informational listen ) , as well . John Carpenter's film is better , in my opinion . . . but they are certainly both well worth watching . I recommend this to fans of the genres and the people involved in making it .
450908	2093818	116629	7.0	Undeniably entertaining	This film can't be claimed to possess much , if any , intellectual value . It won't change the way we view anything ( well , it may have people looking up , and / or appreciating the unblocked view of the sky more than usual ) . It won't revolutionize film-making . It may not even stay in your mind for terribly long after watching it . But it is an entertaining piece while you do , and hey , it's a chance for Trekkers to see Brent Spiner outside of Star Trek . Also , it never actually claims to be more than what it is , a Summer blockbuster . The film wastes no time introducing the extra-terrestrial element . The pacing throughout the film isn't bad . The plot is decent . Emmerich makes both disaster and action aspects work well . The film apparently holds , and may very well continue to hold , the record for the most miniature model-work in any one movie . . . that says something about just how much action is packed into this . The acting is fine . The dialog is . . . not the smartest ever written . The characters aren't bad . The real draw here is definitely the explosions and action . I recommend this to fans of action - and / or disaster-flicks , as well as fans of the actors and / or the director , Roland Emmerich .
450052	2093818	215685	7.0	Surreal	The short film that directly precedes The Meaning of Life by Monty Python ( meaning , it runs directly before the rest of the film starts ) , this was put together by Terry Gilliam , the masterful director among the team , and the man behind both Twelve Monkeys and the animations that the team include in the Flying Circus television series . I have to admit that this is my least favorite of all of the full production , but it can't be claimed that this is not well-done . Direction is top-notch , and the whole thing runs very smoothly . Acting fits well . Production values are all of very high quality . The music and score is great , and this even gets a Monty Python song , and a good one at that . Cinematography and editing ( save for just a few obvious cuts for effects ) are rather good . This hardly features the Monty Python people ( on-screen ) at all , save for a few cameos . It's got a run-time of 16 minutes or so , if you count the credits . The pacing is marvelous . It doesn't overstay its welcome , nor does it end before it should . It has the utter madness and bizarre humor that most things Python do , coupled with that of Gilliam himself . The ending itself is typically Monty Python , and a fitting end . I recommend this to any fan of Gilliam and Monty Python , but do give the rest of The Meaning of Life your time and attention , too . . . I personally think it's worth it .
450897	2093818	19702	7.0	Pretty good , considering how old it is	This is one of Hitchcock's very first films , and his first talkie . Considering that , I think the actors do a pretty good job . . . this is probably the first time they have to act while talking at the same time , instead of just using their body language . Even though this is one of Hitchcock's first movies , you can clearly see a lot of his later famous details , such as camera angles , playing with shadows and such . The psychological terror is also terrific , though not as sophisticated as in his later films . Hitchcock took good use of what was possible at the time , concerning effects , editing tricks and the likes . The plot is pretty good , like with most of Hitchcock's films . The acting is pretty good , especially considering that it's one of the first talking movies , and the actors were not terribly experienced with that kind of acting . The movie moves along at an acceptable pace , though it isn't as exciting or psychologically terrifying as many of his later movies . However , it's interesting to see how good a director he was , even at that time in his career . I recommend this to most fans of Hitchcock , as most will find it enjoyable , if for nothing else than at least a look at how he directed movies back then .
450094	2093818	93378	7.0	Fine	I don't know anything about the real person this is about apart from what this tells . I can't claim to be particularly interested in this film ( and to put it about as nicely as possible , bio-pic is not my genre ) , or the real person , so please chalk it up to that if this review bears marks of that . The music is definitely good ( that's probably always been my reason for watching this ) , if 50's rock is your thing , I could see there being worse things to sit through to listen to such , but I can't say for sure that I've watched any others of these ( Elvis films don't count , right ? ) . The plot isn't bad and develops OK . The pacing is reasonable . The acting certainly has bright spots . . . Pantoliano is a pretty positive addition as usual , and Pena , who I've seen since earlier viewings of this in both NCIS and WaT and performed well in both ( particularly the latter ) is great . Never been a fan of Phillips , this doesn't really alter that one way or the other . Cinematography and editing are nothing special . I couldn't tell you if the people look ( or sound , in the case of the singers ) their parts , or if this follows the actual story ( at all ) , I'm afraid . I recommend this to fans of the musicians and their work .
450749	2093818	219699	7.0	A little too much drama and a too little horror , but pretty good nonetheless	I'm normally not a big fan of Sam Raimi's work ; I enjoyed Darkman to a certain extent , but hated Spiderman . Most of his other films , I've only heard about , never seen . This movie proves that he has a lot of talent ; there are a lot of very psychologically horrifying sequences . The plot is very interesting , through most of the film it keeps your interest quite well . The characters are interesting and well-developed . The acting is all great , every single actor does a very good job . The atmosphere of the film is fantastic , the horror scenes were all well-made ; I jumped several point throughout the scenes . The psychological terror was almost unbearable ; every single sequence involving psychological terror is very disturbing . Whoever did the editing for this film obviously knows a great deal about how to affect the subconscious . The films supernatural side is very well-handled , and seems quite believable . I'd recommend this to any fan of supernatural horror , or any fan of Sam Raimi and his style . A pretty good horror movie , could have been better , but definitely worth watching for fans of the genre .
450989	2093818	285823	7.0	Not as good as Desperado , but decent enough	I am a little disappointed that this isn't as good as Desperado , in fact , it seems like a fairly inferior sequel . Oddly , I still can't bring myself to rate it lower than 7 . I guess it just has the Rodriguez feeling to it , and that just saves pretty much anything from being bad . This has about the same amount of style to it that the first two ( especially Desperado ) had , but far too many surprises and twists . I don't know , I guess Rodriguez was nervous the audience might lose interest if someone important didn't get killed every five minutes . I could barely keep track of who was working for who , but it didn't matter much , as they were usually killed off when they've done what they were there to do in the film . Another thing is that you don't really feel with any of the characters , most of the main characters are cool , most of them are bad , and the few that remain are either good or neutral . You know the motivation for a few of the characters , but you don't really feel anything for or against any of them . There's just far too much action , constantly something going on , and far too little character development . Now , don't get me wrong , I love Rodriguez ' films , especially the Mariachi series , but when he doesn't give us anything to really like or dislike about any of the characters , he can't expect us to care when he kills them off . But , then again , maybe that's just it ; he just wants to kill them off , maybe just because he can , he doesn't want any loose ends , whatever . That's OK , I just think he did better with making the deaths dramatic in Desperado ( either they go out in a blaze of glory or they get killed in a dramatic / important fashion ) , whereas in this , it just seemed like he was getting bored of them and decided to kill them so the audience wouldn't be disappointed that one or more of the bad guys lived . The action also seems a little less intense than it was in Desperado , which is disappointing , since it should be better , since it is a sequel . The dialog and acting is about as good as it was in Desperado , and I guess the overall quality is almost as good as Desperado . The film has the same unrealistic ' flying far backwards or upwards when shot'-effect that Desperado had , it's just used far more , which I can't really decide on whether I think it was a good or a bad decision ; it looks cool in some instances , definitely , but some times , it just looks a little corny and takes the focus off the action . All in all , the film is definitely worth watching for fans of Desperado and / or El Mariachi , especially since it does a pretty good job of continuing the same story of those films . The film is probably the last we'll see in this series , considering how it ends ; when I saw El Mariachi , I already knew that Desperado existed , but even if I didn't know it , I would have figured it out after seeing the ending . When I saw Desperado , I could also figure out from the very ending that Rodriguez was going to treat us to Mariachi at least one more time . This time around , it seems like he's shown us everything he wanted to show us with this character . I doubt that he's going to make more movies about him . I recommend this to any fans of Rodriguez ' style , humor and other films , and fans of the previous Mariachi films . It's definitely worth watching if you're into the other two films or just Rodriguez ' films in general .
450574	2093818	451118	7.0	Doesn't get where it's going without stumbling along the way	I base this on the release for the PC . I'm not ruling out that some of the problems have to do with that , that this was geared towards consoles . Hey , I won't claim that this is all negatives , it isn't . This does recreate many favorite scenes , almost all they could ( albeit hardly any flying ) . It does , of course , expand on them , otherwise this would be even shorter than it is , and not all of this is bad . There are also new levels , the quality of which varies , but , honestly , there are several ( not all of them ) nice ideas , and done well , to be found in them . At any time , you can replay an earlier one , and twice , you're given a Mission Selector , and can choose the order of the next handful of them . The story-telling is OK , the worst part of it is the hideously , and oddly , cut up and stitched together Frankenstein's Monster of the trilogy that is the series of clips they use ( a couple of times , it even seems like they just thought " well , this was funny , let's put that in there " ) . Don't get me started on the crappy music they put to it . The sound is well-done , though the acting can be awful , and the voices do not always fit . Link , for example , and can someone tell me when The Merovingian became German ? The new plot has good to it . The acrobatics , shooting and fighting are probably the biggest attractions to this . They are a mixed bag . There are cool moves , but it is truly sad that they had to be taught how to make a VG taking place in this universe by the new Prince of Persia ones ( of 2003 , ' 04 and ' 05 ) , and incredible that they still managed to screw it up . And the guns are fine , if often useless ( and why so few ? ) . Aiming , well , it can be done , they actually put a cross-hair in this time , though the mouse doesn't move right . Now , the martial arts system , when you get past how clumsy it can be , as well as how sluggish and either too fast or overly slow ( that's a theme with this one , it hits the extremes , and goes back and forth between them ) it often reacts to your commands , it can be entertaining . There are a lot of combos , if you can activate them , with how similar they are to do , and on account of them making up most of the powerful attacks , the Free Form thing didn't entirely work , and you wind up typically taking them on one at a time . There are not enough buttons devoted to it . Meleé weapons range , but tend to be a positive in this . The Bosses . . . do not . Defending by striking could be fantastic , but it wasn't really , here . The camera is free , with zoom and 360 degree turning . The abilities are decent enough , the main thing here is that each you get is helpful a little , and that's it . The adventure portions are nothing but a method of prolonging this . They were happy to make it possible for characters to be tossed about , and objects ( as well as walls ) around you to break , so it's happening all over the place , and it quite frankly looks preposterous . This makes the astounding occurrences in the three commonplace , and they lose their impact . The bugs and glitches are all over this , and stability could be better . The graphics are great , with fluid animation , if at least one of the faces ( Smith ) come out looking ridiculous . Cut-scenes are , with one exception ( which is CGI , and gorgeous ) , in-engine , and fair . This does manage to put a lot of you-know-who's in one place , up against you , lets you squeeze the trigger in the chopper , and features aerial combat . This is either too easy , or annoying , depending on what specific portion you're playing . Replayability is essentially nonexistent . There is bonus stuff , including an extraordinarily unfunny outtake reel . Saving is still automatic , and offering only four slots . The puns are gag-inducing . The altered continuity is reasonable . This takes some of the best moments in the original film and makes gimmicks out of them . Why all the silliness ? The changed ending ( cheap attempt at getting audiences to purchase this , contact me and I'll let you know what it is ) , which I actually don't consider to be a poor concept , it's merely wrong for this ? My guess would be that the brothers saw the reception the sequels got , and got scared , gave up trying , or perhaps both . Thus they almost invariably ( there is philosophy in this , and situations that could really be impeccable ) didn't try to make this serious . I would hate to think that they belong in the group of people who refuse to believe that games can be complex and innovative , after what they did to the action flick genre , and reinvigorating the science fiction cinema . A tremendous lot can be achieved in this medium , and the only cause for alarm at these being less than stellar is the sheer fact that done right , an effort of this kind , inside the Matrix universe could be excellent . This , however , is downright stupid . Superficial and empty aren't off the wall as words to describe it . Not to mention ammo for those who claim that the 1999 movie was nothing but a stroke of luck . It's a terrible waste of potential . In case you weren't sure , I've been comparing this to Enter the Matrix ( so much that I didn't write where I did so ) . All in all , I'm sorry , I find that to be the superior title . Less frustration , comes closer to you being able to count on it to deliver , and while both overreach , the result here is at times painful . This has , well , not direct sexuality , but adult material , as well as language , relatively strong , not in copious amounts . I recommend this to fans of the franchise , if you prefer the visuals and battles to the exploration and the food for thought ( perfectly acceptable , I simply feel that what the Wachowski's made deserves more ) .
450808	2093818	382779	7.0	Action with a twist in a game that's sadly much too short	Pretty much from the get-go , this grabbed me . Control is quite easy to get into , the interface is very quickly gotten used to and anyone who's tried a shooter before can pretty much sit down with this right away . The plot isn't poor , it's merely not awfully new or original , either . It's told well , if almost entirely in hints , and the epic scope falls surprisingly flat . The audio is fairly good , though there are some bugs . . . the sound seems to cut off for some of the weapons , if too many are firing at the same time . The music is marvelous and fitting , a healthy mix of techno-like tunes and film-like score . Animation is great , with all movements looking natural . Graphics are rather well-done , sharp and reasonably detailed . . . lighting is somewhat limited , but by no means bad . Where this really wins you over , however , is the game-play . . . thoroughly intense , with the enemies posing a serious threat , and skill and tactics being necessary . This introduces something entirely new ; the offensive cover system . Since Splinter Cell hit stores in 2002 ( and became hugely popular ) , many action titles have added wall-hugging to their repertoire . However , this game takes it to a new level , adding multiple ways of firing from behind cover , and making it the main focus of the game and play . In any level , you are massively outnumbered . Being that just about all your enemies have received military training ( and they only get tougher the further you get in the game ) and all being armed to the same degree as you , there's no way you're going to make it out alive if you rush in . Instead , you must use your surroundings , taking cover behind just about any solid object , and fire at them from behind cover ( and they , in turn , will do the same , which is where the tactics enter ) . Taking cover is easy as it gets , and you even get a brief training mission , in which that , along with the usual shooting game basics are covered . Don't bother trying stealth . . . in fact , this does not give you anything but this one way of going about it . The arms selection is limited . There are about a dozen ones to choose from , and that is easy to keep track of , and none of them are useless ( though I found relatively little use for the shotgun ) . The guns are all military-brand , well-known and thoroughly effective ones . The majority are assault rifles and SMGs , but one shotgun and a sniper are also available . Some of the assault rifles are equipped with a grenade launcher , as well . And you get to play with grenades , too : Mini-grenades , regular " pineapple " type , " sticky " grenades ( which , unsurprisingly , stick ( to the surface that they land on . . . and that includes people ) ) and flash-bangs . When behind cover , you can use the targeting reticle to direct your fire . . . you may lean out to aim properly , or you can send " blindfire " ( something I don't recall seeing in any other game , like the cover-system itself ) . The grenades can be directed in this manner , as well ; simply point the reticle at what you want to go boom and hold down the throwing button for either a brief or a slightly longer time , depending on if you want to lob it a few feet or throw it a distance . When firing , you'll also be able to activate a scope , for everything in your arsenal in the game but the grenade launcher has one . The level design is fairly simple , point A to point B . The difficulty is appropriate ; your surroundings are extremely seldom so open that you are forced into cover-less combat ( since it will often result in near-immediate death ) , and the enemies keep you on your toes , applying military tactics to get you . The AI is magnificent ; the enemies actions are unpredictable , well-thought out and swiftly carried out . They do occasionally mess up . The whole thing is nicely stylized to the point of pure awesomeness . From the bloodless deaths of the enemy combatants to the exceedingly well-animated , beautifully rendered cinematics , providing back-story ( which starts out vague , but gets solid soon enough . . . sort of ) . However , at times , the game feels like it's trying just a little too hard to be hip , to grab the attention of the MTV generation . Voice acting is often exaggerated , with the actors trying to come off tough and bad-ass . Lines are too superficial and empty . And the countless references to " the game " . . . it's as if the makers wanted to remind the player constantly that he was , in fact , playing a VG . And when they do that , why not utilize that to explain the loading feature , one of the things that takes the player the most out of the experience of being someone else ? The console game In Cold Blood had a terrific explanation for loading , in the very concept of the game . While the tone is dark and bleak , there is still strong color in this . . . they are merely from the gloomier end of the palette . The camera was also a bother . . . often when diving ( typically employed to get the heck out of dodge when there's a grenade nearby ) , your perspective would be lost , often getting you killed , as it takes time to regain . The main problem , however , is how short this is . When I read that there would be 15 scenarios , I didn't expect each to take 5-15 minutes to beat . The game took me only a few hours . It doesn't hold much risk of getting boring or overstaying its welcome . With a pretty low re-playability value ( there are no points , so no high-scores to beat , and most of the missions and levels are linear in their design ) , and only two difficulty settings , that's just not at all enough . Apart from a satisfying boss fight and a nice cut-scene , beating the game doesn't beget you anything but a mission selector . All in all , a thoroughly entertaining , cool , but far too brief , arcade type third-person shooter that's different . I recommend this to fans of action , particularly those who aren't keen on rushing in , blindly firing .
450747	2093818	206314	7.0	Pretty intense thriller	The idea of this movie is actually pretty good ; two teenagers do a prank call on a CB radio , but the prank turns on them . Most teenagers have probably been in a situation where they themselves made a prank call . At the very least , everyone knows about it . The film has some excellent shocks throughout the movie , and all of the ' thrilling ' sequences are very intense , sometimes bordering on the extreme . The plot is pretty good , even pretty original , as far as I know . The acting is good enough . The characters are believable and their actions are understandable , most of the time . The movie has some very good cinematography and some pretty good cinematic effects . The ending , though a bit far-fetched , was the perfect way to end it , in my opinion . I couldn't have imagined a better way to end it . I recommend this to pretty much any teen who enjoys thrillers , especially the ones who like to relate to the theme and plot . Nearly every teenager in the world can in some way relate to at least one of the main characters in this film .
450245	2093818	384001	7.0	In some ways , better than the first game	Yet again , Earth needs the help of heroic young boy Billy Blaze , aka ( once he's wearing his brother's football helmet ) Commander Keen . As he returns to Earth , he sees a huge spacecraft hovering over the planet . . . the Vorticon mother-ship . They had attempted to keep him from returning to Earth , as they realized that he was the only one who could stop their evil schemes . . . but Keen won that time , and with your help , he will , this time , too . The entire game takes place on the mother-ship . The Vorticons are intending to blow up the planet ( as the title alludes to ) , through targeting eight of the largest cities , and Keen must single-handedly destroy all of the laser cannons ( or Tantalus Rays , as they are known in the game ) aimed at the cities in order to stop them and ensure that the world is safe . The story is more epic and exciting than that of the first . . . whilst it certainly was fun to collect the parts of the Bean-and-Bacon Megarocket to enable the Commander to fly back to his home planet , saving said planet is somewhat more interesting . I would say that the first game works well as an introduction to the universe , character and series , and this raises the stakes and is a solid sequel . A few new features are added , one of which can be recognized from the later games , such as the two in Goodbye Galaxy ! , namely , moving platforms . Light switches are also added , but I will leave it up to the players to find out what they are good for ( though I will say that they are extremely helpful ) . The general surroundings are considerably more hostile towards Keen . . . where the first game took place on a planet inhabited by both friendly , agreeable aliens and . . . less friendly ones , this has you inside the mother-ship of some aliens that are dead-set on destroying your home-planet ( though you do find out something interesting in the game , regarding that . . . all may not be what it seems ) . As such , the Vorticons themselves are not your only concern , since the ship is full of complicated technology powering and running it , quite a bit of which is lethal to eight-year-old human boys . The robots aren't exactly the most forgiving type , either , in particular the variety that fly back and forth , occasionally firing three quick blasts of energy . However , the small ones who merely push you ( which , in itself , with such dangerous surroundings , can be enough to kill Keen ) may prove useful more often than not . The colors are somewhat more grey in this , though not exactly bleak ( it definitely is still a children's game ) . Between the end of the last game , and the start of this , Keen has gained a new ray gun , one belonging to an elite warrior of the Vorticon race . . . this proves to be more powerful than his own from the first game , so he keeps it throughout the entire game . Essentially , this means that you can now shoot those pesky wolf-like things , which were invincible in the first game . The controls remain the same , " heavy " , laggy , bordering on ( and occasionally crossing that line to ) clumsy , and with the trial of two-button shooting , which causes problems when trying to fight enemies , one in particular , who takes three rounds to go down , is able to shoot back ( and only one shot is necessary to take Keen out of the equation ) , jumps high and moves fast . In-game saving is missed , though I will admit that I only got to play this and the other two parts of the trilogy after having completed Goodbye Galaxy ! ( or , more accurately , the first part of it , Secret of the Oracle , the fourth entry into the series ) and Keen Dreams , so I was perhaps spoiled . There is still no difficulty setting , either , though the game does pose a reasonable challenge . Wikipedia even lists this as the most difficult of the trilogy , though I would say that the third is , each game in Invasion of the Vorticons ( the first three games ) gets more difficult than the last . The game takes a little longer to complete , not to mention more skill and perseverance . The game-play is about the same as that of the first . There are a few puzzles to solve , and some time is spent locating key-cards and generally finding your way through the levels . You get to choose the order of the levels again , well , within reason , that is . Level design is quite good . The humor is the same cartoony brand as the first , directed mainly towards but by no means exclusively appealing to , children ( and like with the first , there really isn't so much of it that you can't simply ignore it if it downright bothers you ) . The platform gaming remains fun , and the additions make things more interesting . It's also quite entertaining to play . Once again , extra lives are gained through amassing enough points , which will also ultimately count towards your ranking on the high score list which is still the main incentive in the series towards replaying the game , and this list will also say how many of the eight cities you managed to save from laser-induced annihilation before the game ended . The sound is still somewhat simple , but it's good for what it is . The graphics aren't marvelous , and they are 2D , all the way , but they aren't bad . While I'm not sure I'd say that the series has achieved the greatness that started in the " interlude " , the lost episode , Keen Dreams , which was made between the trilogy and the later three official Commander Keen Games ( the Goodbye Galaxy ! series and Aliens Ate My Babysitter ! ) and continued through the last three games ( I have yet to play the Game Boy Color version , and from what I've read of descriptions , I doubt I will make much , if any , effort towards doing so ) , this is about as good as the first game , and surpasses it in a few areas . I recommend this fun little game to fans of the Commander Keen series , and to fans of DOS games and / or platform games .
450293	2093818	399192	7.0	Good extra , helps explain how Rodriguez can work so quickly and cheaply	Showing up the efficiency of a professional studio is not something done every day , but Robert Rodriguez pulls it off and makes it look effortless to do so in this short . Clearly ( as is his usual and preferred method of working ) cutting the whole thing in his mind as he goes along ( look and listen when he first enters the house and see if you agree with me ) , he shows us his own home studio , which is his garage , and which holds all of his sound mixing setups , an area reserved for special effects work and an editing computer . He takes us through the sound programs and equipment in a manner that is very informational yet not boring for a second . . . he even goes on to show in great detail how he did the music . This is interesting throughout , and there is not a dull moment to be found . Rodriguez ' drive and energy keeps any project that he has done all the work on himself ( look at The Faculty for an example of something . . . less than all the way Rodriguez ) fast-paced and interesting to watch , including these extras . I recommend this to anyone interested in finding out how Robert's post-production work is done , and any hopefuls ( with the money to afford such ) who wish to own their own production facilities , just like he .
450384	2093818	215129	7.0	Not the best teen comedy , but a very good one	The R-rated teen comedies is a fairly new genre , that has created numerous films of varying quality over the past few years . The best of them is arguably American Pie , and while this one comes close , it just doesn't reach the same high level of quality . It is , however , very close . The plot is very good ; it's based on a mix-up ( an uncommon mix-up , but not an entirely unbelievable one , I suppose ) , and on various situations that most teen guys could definitely relate to . The acting is good , all of the leads give pretty good performances , as well as most of the supporting characters . Of course , a somewhat well-known teen-movie actor Seann William Scott is expected to be good , but Amy Smart , Paulo Costanzo , DJ Qualls and Breckin Meyer impressed me , partly because I hadn't seen them in any other movies . The characters are well-written , credible and you can mostly relate to them . The humor is great ; it's typical R-rated teen comedy humor , and it's really done great . It's hardly ever overplayed , and there aren't really any of the gags or jokes that fall flat . What puts this slightly below American Pie on the overall entertainment scale is the way this seems to be in a rush to get done with many scenes , and just squeeze as many jokes and gags out in as short time as possible , in order to get to the next scene ; American Pie mastered the art that is pacing . It was laid-back , calm and easy to get used to . This has so much stuff crammed into it in such a short amount of time that if you don't pay attention you might miss something . It also has fewer situations that you can relate to than American Pie . One thing that this film has a great amount of is re-watch value ; I've seen it no less than ten times now , and I'm not the slightest bit tired of it , which is more than what I can say about American Pie . All in all , a pretty good R-rated teen comedy , but not the best . I recommend it to any fan of teen comedies .
450074	2093818	215208	7.0	Overlooked ?	Yes , we all know about the usual quality level of licensed releases . No , this does not particularly raise the bar . But it is definitely an entirely reasonable effort , and I would say that if you like the movie , you may enjoy this . I will start with my personal favorite thing about all of Star Wars . . . the light-sabers . The use of them can be entertaining enough in this , and the way they did them in this ( I will keep it vague intentionally so as to not spoil it for those who have not seen the Prequel Trilogy , it is awesome beyond the point that it should be blown ) definitely fits ( and , lest we forget , this is the only time it has been done this way in this medium , to the best of my knowledge ) with the recent silver screen depiction . . . but for one thing . The speed . They move rather slowly in this , both the sword itself and when they move as they attack with it . There is also not exactly an abundance of different moves . They look real nice , however , in fact , the graphics of this in general are quite well-done . The engine somewhat supports an enormous scope , if you aren't allowed to go everywhere , which helps the feeling of being in the galaxy far , far away . The architecture can be . . . blocky , I guess is the word , by which I mean that a lot of . . . big , square . . . " things " are found . " Eye-sore " and " distracting " spring to mind . The way they kept you out of areas that you shouldn't have access to can also be clumsy . The level design on the whole isn't bad , though . . . and you get to visit and to some extent explore locations ( unless I'm terribly mistaken , all of them ) seen in the film . The voice acting varies a bit , and there are points where there is too much dialog . The overall writing is pretty decent . . . the story is told relatively well , and a little expanding is done . In spite of that , this isn't that long . . . I can imagine it could be beat in a weekend . Add to that that the re-playability value is limited to only one single-player campaign , no difficulty settings , and with no more than a sparse breakdown of your performance and time following its completion . There is good stuff in this , though . You get Force Push , and even , at certain points , Mind Trick . The former is especially fun to use , to effects similar to those we've seen at the cinema . This is an action adventure game , if anyone was not aware , and both aspects are fairly nicely done . The first-mentioned runs well , letting you fire half a dozen guns or so , and features throw-ables , as well ( the method for aiming . . . don't even think you're gonna use a mouse for this . . . can be a tad trying ) . The latter portion is fine . . . the puzzles are arguably easy and tend to be both few and far between , as well . This is seen in the third person , or a mix of that and bird's-eye-view , and the camera is usually helpful ( with a couple of glaringly obvious exceptions ) , in spite of you not having much sway over it . . . much at all , and there are some great tricks done with it . This isn't always perfectly smooth . You get to control multiple different characters ( anyone's who's watched The Phantom Menace could probably guess who all four of them are , and I'd be happy to tell anyone who asks ) , each with skills and / or weapons that the others do not , and for my money , all are useful ( really , every piece of your arsenal and every ability in this comes in handy herein ) . I realize it's not popular , but I do care for the Stunner , if it can be a trial . . . the concept and execution may be unique , and in spite of a measure of unpredictability to it , it makes for magnificent dispatching of adversaries . The AI can be . . . well , is , erratic , but there are interesting and noteworthy details to it . . . for example , I've seen foes step out of the line of fire of a projectile headed at them , successfully , as well as move if they are being hit and either can't see you or don't appear to be able to shoot straight at you . Sometimes annoying , perhaps , but you gotta admire the technology and effort behind it . The internal logic of this is , more often than not , broken . . . you may find yourself trying a lot of things that seem like they could be the solution , and it turns out it was something else entirely . The low level of interactivity with your environment doesn't outright aid you . The game-play is very cool when at its best . This was seemingly rushed , to get them out at the same time , and there is some feel of it being an unfinished project . And if I , or anyone else , really , for that matter , said " buggy " in reference to this , you can be almost 100 percent sure that they do not mean the mode of transportation . This has several cut-scenes , in-game ( scripted without errors , more or less ) and fully rendered alike , and the last-mentioned are purdy . All are directed just fine . I don't believe there are any clips of TPM itself in this , I , myself , did not miss them with what we had instead ( bearing in mind that I like it more than the other two PT entries ) . The score is marvelous , save for the remarkably abrupt shifts that there can be . The sound is done well almost invariably , including in the menus , which are concise . The boss fights vary , not all are imaginative , but none are downright poor . The enemies are somewhat well-done and diverse . All in all . . . I'd conclude that if you dig the flick , you are set for having a solid playing experience , with hours of running around the SW universe with this , provided you can accept blemishes . This is not a flawless masterpiece , but it by no means deserves being branded an utter failure . I recommend this to fans of Episode 1 , and the franchise in general .
450447	2093818	74452	7.0	Good acting , but poor script and dull plot	When dealing with fiction , it's mostly easy to make it entertaining . When dealing with non-fiction , true , historically correct stories , you have to make an effort to keep it true to facts ; however , you still have to make it entertaining , otherwise , everyone but the historians and story-loving audiences will find it less than worth their time ; and that is exactly what went wrong here . As far as I know , this film is fairly historically accurate ( apart from the main plot-line , which I'm not entirely sure about ) . It's also well-acted and the locations and costumes are authentic . Thing is , that's all it is ; authentic , historically accurate ( to a certain extent , at least ) and well-acted . The film has little to no entertainment value . I realize that a war film shouldn't be a hilarious or something to cheer at ( like an action flick , for example ) , but it can at least show it's audience the courtesy of being slightly interesting , apart from the plot ( which , I think , to some extent deviates from what really happened , in a typical Hollywood fashion ) which seems predictable and is easily figured out from the very beginning , simply due to it obviously trying hard to be historically accurate , which negates the tension that the last scenes are trying to build . Even in the very end , which contains a twist ( obviously designed to build tension ) is predictable and almost immediately figured out . The plot is somewhat good , it's just too predictable and virtually everyone will figure out how it's going to end , save for the historically ignorant ( who probably won't see the movie anyway ) . The pacing is bad , unless , once again , you're interested in seeing this for the historical accuracy . The film never really seemed to take off , until the last half hour or so , when you've stopped caring about the plot . The acting is very good ; pretty much the only thing worthwhile in this movie . The characters are well-written ( I guess , but they are based on real people , so there's not much room to go wrong there ) and mostly credible . The cinematography is nothing memorable . The costumes and locations are very authentic and well done . All in all , not a particularly good film , but worth watching for fans of ( fairly ) historically accurate war films , and fans of the various actors , since they all give great performances . Anyone else should avoid this . There are far better war movies out there .
450300	2093818	78346	7.0	A good start	I've never cared much for Superman . He gets all the attention , while ( in my opinion underrated ) heroes like Spiderman are widely ignored . He's just too strong . Superstrength , invulnerability . . . and there's only one thing that can hurt him at all , and it's not even of this world . The main reason I watched this was to get the background that I presumably need to fully understand and appreciate Superman Returns . . . the latest directorial effort by Bryan Singer in the field of superheroes . From a man who's brought us two of the best comic book films of all time and recent years , who names something his dream-project . . . it's no choice at all . I acquired all four Superman films , and intend to watch the next three after Returns . The first thing that struck me with this was the marvelous production values , and the visually stunning production design . The plot is quite good and well told . The pacing seemed a tad off to me . . . somehow , the time spent on various situations and subplots just didn't seem to fit . Maybe I'm too used to newer films . The acting was mostly good . Reeves fills the boots well . The humor ( though some of it is very funny , such as Lois Lane's slip of the tongue during the interview with the title character ) is silly , much of the time . . . personally , I didn't like that . The bad guys , with the exception of Luthor ( and even he , in some areas . . . come on , guys . . . wigs ? Though , admittedly , the final reveal was pretty cool ) are just too daft . I realize that Americans don't want anyone to view villains as anything but criminals , evil people , but give them just a little character . Give Superman a worthy opponent . That's what makes a hero . . . overcoming adversity and impossible odds for the good of mankind . The whole fish-out-of-water thing they did with Clark and his colorful and caped alter-ego was perhaps a tad overdone . The effects , I must say , are good , if dated . They did a good job of making us believe that a man can fly . And I must say , the film is definitely a comic book movie . . . the characterizations , locations and situations are clear indications of that . All in all , a fine introduction to the character , and the references and in-jokes are kind of cute , but I didn't find it out-of-this-world amazing . And can someone explain to me why Lex's assistant must show cleavage in just about every shot she's in ? Talk about gratuitous . I recommend this to fans of the character and / or superhero movies in general .
449863	2093818	309698	7.0	Just when you thought twist-movies had improved . . . minor spoilers	I picked this movie up at Blockbuster after having been recommended it a long time ago . The beginning looked somewhat promising , and I enjoyed the use of a non-linear time-line . The way the many characters were brought together was even kind of clever ( even though it's basically just a bunch of people driving in cars at the same place at the same time ) . Most of the accidents in the beginning was kind of dumb and even a tad staged ; most of them seemed to have been easily avoided if the drivers would just pay attention to the road instead of doing everything else at once . Don't consider that a spoiler ; it all happens within the first five minutes or so . The plot quickly turns into a regular ' Who Done It ' , with even the least attentive viewers being able to figure out the order in which order the people get whacked . The pacing tries to be intense , but fails to be so past the first ten minutes . I could barely keep paying attention to it . Up to the very end , this seemed to be a well-done and pretty but ultimately very pedestrian mystery-thriller , with no real surprises . Then came the twist . And it got so much worse . Not only was the twist easy to figure out and a horrible cop-out , it ruined everything the movie had built up ( as little as there was ) to that point . It kicked down every brick of the foundation of the film . Even worse , the film goes on for about fifteen minutes past that . And here's the real kicker ; there's another twist . Even more painful , and even more predictable . You have been warned . If you still have any wish to see this movie at any point , I will objectively review what I haven't reviewed already . The characters are diverse and interesting , and they have a fair amount of development each . The cast does contain some very talented people , unfortunately , too few of them are given anything to do . Jake Busey and John C . McGinley are criminally underused . The film contains a few genuine scares and some decent enough guessing of the killer's identity . I recommend it to fans of the actors and people who enjoy the genres . Just be prepared for a pitifully bad twist ending .
450376	2093818	120082	7.0	An idea worthy as a sequel , an execution that almost measures up	After Scream respectfully made fun of the slasher sub-genre , this sequel was done . In addition to more satire and clever jabs at the films , from the very first scene , this also has some material on sequels in the genre . An obvious choice , yes , but why not ? Such would not have worked in the first film , for self-explanatory reasons , and while it may not all be of quite as high quality as that of the film preceding this , there are still points made . The plot is fairly good , but the reveal at the end is just not as effective as the one of the first ( which , going by the Trivia , can be attributed to the original script leaking . . . thanks , guys , now will ya just let them make the movies in peace ? ) . There are suspenseful and tense scenes in this , as well , and , as the sequel rules dictate ( and as is said out loud within the film ) , this is bigger than the first . There's more blood and gore ( though I'm not sure the death scenes are necessarily better than , or even match , the ones of the original ) . The characters are reasonably well-done , if the new ones aren't as interesting as those of the first . At least one character of the first gets more of a role . This picks up nicely from the first ( not right where it left off ) , and should definitely not be watched prior to watching the first . If you have , however , watched Scream and want more of the same , this'll do nicely . It isn't quite as good , but it is worth watching . Score , music and sound is well-done . This has some good scares , too . I recommend this to any fan of the first , horror and / or respectful parodies of said genre , specifically earlier-mentioned sub-genre .
450019	2093818	423822	7.0	Interesting	This short , featured on the third season set of Alias , J . J . Abrams ' hit spy show , details something that may very well have happened during the course of the show . . . and it's presented in a crisp visual style , the way only something animated could look . It's more like a living comic book than the show , as noticed by both my fiancée and I . The animation is quite good , complete with fairly realistic-looking effects and possibly even 3D CGI . It seems to be , or at least to get inspiration from , Animé . The title features Jennifer Garner's voice , and both she and Terry O'Quinn appear on-screen in an introductory clip . The action is good , and the way it's done wasn't bad . The pace was a really good part of this . . . it moves as it should , pretty much all the way through . The writing varies . . . not all the lines are great , and I'm not sure the narration is necessary . Some things are too vague , others are spelled out too much . The plot unfolds fine . As far as overall writing goes , it doesn't at any point reach the level of intricacy of the show itself , but it never seems to aspire to . It's more of a story in the universe of Alias . . . maybe Abrams wanted to do something in animation ( taking a note from the Wachowski brothers ? ) , I don't know . It's not bad , and for the fans , it can be a nice enough treat . It's not a vital piece of Alias canon , but it may work as an attempt at filling a void some fans might have felt the show left at one point . I recommend it to fans of the show ( it will make no sense whatsoever if you haven't watched enough of it . . . the set on which it is located is something of a hint ) who enjoy Animé and / or want to watch all they can of Alias . . . even if it's not live action .
450337	2093818	109836	7.0	Scary , graphic and quite good version of the story	Let me start off stating that I've never read the original novel by Mary Shelley ( though from what I hear , this is one of the most accurate versions , as far as film goes ) . This is a very good story of how man tries to ' beat ' or fight death , and of how a lack of concern for the repercussions of your actions can come back and haunt you later . The main problem with it , however , is that it comes off heavy-handed and grand , seemingly attempting to be more than it is . The dramatic music seems overdone , as does much of the dialog . But for what it is , it's quite good . There are plenty of jump-scares , and the violence is well-done and effective . The plot is well-written and interesting . The pacing seems a tad odd , at times off , but mostly works to the film's advantage . The acting is great , in particular DeNiro as the Creature . It's an unusual role for him , but when you think of how much effort he puts into each and every performance , it makes perfect sense . The characters are well-written and credible . The film is thoroughly entertaining and well-made , though it does occasionally become too heavy-handed and Branagh is at times self-important . In the end , I would guess you'd be better off reading the novel . . . but if you feel like watching a fairly good visual presentation of it , this film would be a good choice . I recommend this to fans of anyone involved in the production of it , and possibly of the original book . Don't expect it to follow the novel word-by-word , though .
450175	2093818	758730	7.0	Watch it for the entertainment value , and you may very well enjoy yourself	No , this isn't on the level that has previously dominated the two franchises , nor was the first AvP . . . but hey , the Alien franchise hasn't had a stellar film since the second movie ( the Predator , since the first . . . ouch ) , and honestly , if you go see this purely to be entertained , and bring a fairly generous amount of suspension of the ol ' disbelief , well , it just might be worth it . We don't particularly care about the characters ( in spite of at least some attempts by the filmmakers ) , but we are watching the movie to watch the two races duke it out . The plot is fairly thin , and the ending is perhaps something of a deus ex machina ( basically . . . they wrote themselves into a corner , and then got themselves out in a way that does perhaps not entirely work ) , although some of it , somehow , actually does work to place this as a prequel ( well , somewhat ) to the other films , the original Alien and Predator films ( maybe more the former , in fact , maybe entirely the former ) . The film picks up exactly where AvP left off . . . if you liked the way that ended , and want to see where it goes from there , this does just that . It starts nice , fast , and immediately , and keeps to a reasonably high pace , partially by cutting back and forth between various characters and situations , keeping things in motion . Personally , I'm not sure I would have minded less plot and more action , but oh well . The action does definitely have its moments of awesomeness ( this Predator may command more respect than the ones of AvP ) , if more often than not , perhaps too many times , it's difficult to tell what's going on . This is directed by two guys who've done more effects work than directing ( and their direction tends to be of music videos ) , and it shows . . . the movie looks good and has great effects , but I could find rocks that held , evoked and expressed more emotion . The acting is downright atrocious at times , no question ( one actor seems cast purely based on the fact that she can look a lot like Sigourney Weaver , I guess hearkening back to the good days of the franchise . . . then who is supposed to be Arnie , or , I guess even Glover ? ) . The dialog ? Just . . . bad . But again , that's not what we're here for . We're here to see the races of Aliens and Predators fighting and killing in an actual community on Earth , and that's just what we get . And yes , there is some eye candy for the young males , as well . I recommend this to fans of the two " characters " , albeit not your huge fan ( you know who you are ) , the ones who enjoy what Scott , McTiernan and possibly Cameron did , more than wanting to see the two races duke it out . . . you have my respect , but this movie isn't for you , nor was it intended for you , so if you do watch it , know what to expect . Anyone just looking for a good time , watching the creatures cause mayhem and death . . . have at it .
450085	2093818	207201	7.0	A romantic comedy that a guy can see too	This is pretty much the typical romantic comedy , but with an interesting twist ; the main character has the ability to hear womens thoughts . The important thing was that for it to work , the character would be placed in a lot of interesting comical situations , where you could laugh at it , without it being too mocking of womens thoughts , or too far-out to enjoy . It succeeds pretty well , however the way the character gains and loses the ability were handled somewhat poorly . The humor is good , and there is plenty of it , throughout the entire runtime . The characters were believable , and the main character eventually grew to be likable . The plot was good , and the acting likewise . The only thing that brings the movie down , is the poor execution of the gain / loss of the ability to hear womens thoughts , and the sugar-sweet ending , that was too predictable and plain boring , as anyone who's seen one of the hundreds ( possibly thousands ) of romantic comedies out there . No actual new stuff brought to the table , apart from the interesting and original concept of a man being able to hear what women are thinking . OK for a romantic comedy .
450550	2093818	1003278	7.0	At least they weren't werewolves	Credit for the summary goes to my fiancée . This is a featurette found on the DVD of 13 Going On 30 . At least the Special Edition ( you know , the one that doesn't smell like bubble-gum . . . that line was thought up by my significant other , as well ) , that's what we're going by , we wouldn't know about the Fun and Flirty one . It is perhaps best watched if you are very comfortable with your teenage years , or if hearing about the awkwardness of others is at least not too painful . It has several members of the cast talking about , well , said period of time , fortunately found in their respective pasts ( yes , including alternate dimensions ) . It , thusly , consists partially ( in fact , maybe mostly ) of interviews . It's produced fine . Intercut with the speaking are whatever fitting pieces of photographic record that were dug up in research . The tone is light . I recommend this to anyone who liked the film itself , fans of the various actors involved in it , and / or those who want to see Jen when she was younger . . . and yes , I'm afraid she was cute ( if shy and embarrassed ) .
450212	2093818	362179	7.0	Hmm . . . upgrades	Yes , this is more of an upgrade to Jedi Outcast than a sequel . . . and it takes so many steps back and forth ( in quality ) that it winds up being overall on about the same level . . . which , should be noted , is " pretty good " . If you dug JO , well , grab the shovel again . I might not pay full price for this , as if it was a full new game , as it's more of an adjustment , but that's not to say that it's not worth playing ( at all ) . The music and sound in general isn't bad . There is technically only one new weapon , and a change of appearance of another . The two new multi-player modes are interesting , if not terribly original . . . Power Duel and Siege , the first one is two-on-one duels , and the second seems to be ( I've never played it ) basically Assault mode from Unreal Tournament . . . again , these facts don't have to be negative , not at all . More liberties are taken with the canon . . . at what point do bent rules get so out of shape that you almost wonder why they acknowledged their existence at all ? The makers go for ( and sometimes succeed in ) delivering the most fun ( and at points , open ) experience than making sense or following aforementioned rules . Most of the changes are to make the game more like the movies ( and some are great ) , both trilogies . . . some of them do seem to be more about making it seem like a new release , instead of a polishing up of the last one , and they all vary in quality . The references do almost get too much at points , some ( not all ) , however , are well-done ( humor / boss-fights , same ) . One new vehicle ( and similar ) . The multi-player levels are reasonable , but the amount is somewhat underwhelming . The single-player portion is about as long as that of JO , but shorter . Mostly , missions are one-shot ( and the order in which you play them is more or less up to you ) , and both that fact and the levels themselves , are hit and miss . Level design is clumsy and rushed , at points , visually appealing at others . Voice acting is poor ( but not the joke that that of Mysteries of the Sith was ) . There is an overall story , and though parts are obvious , it's decent , and one twist is OK . You no longer play as Katarn , and you can now customize the look of the original character you control . There are two alien races per gender , in addition to human . That's five in total , four of them alien , and both genders . There are multiple choices for each of them , and three ( head , torso and legs ) groups , with several options . Bringing back from when this series first turned to Jedi affairs , this lets you choose between the Light and the Dark side of the Force . They took the easiest way out on the way they integrated that , but at least they have game-progression and endings based on your decision , following it . Now , the biggest change or addition is what was added to the Lightsaber . You can now choose between each of the variations we've seen in the movies ( I won't say what they are here , if you've watched them , you know , if not , I won't spoil the surprise ) . Moves are added , as well , and you can now actually read how to do them and what they require ( of powers and circumstances ) , and saber battling becomes more interesting ( if still not necessarily too demanding in skill ) , as does the use of the weapon , in general . Mods of JO are in existence that attempt to do almost all of the things that this does , and some an awful lot better ( fans and just in general unpaid creative souls manage to outdo the studios ( and no , I'm not just referring to the medium of video-games , here ) too often to be ignored . . . perhaps that's why so few games are released with tools to create more content or alter what is already in the game , and / or the reason for the easy user-interface to be so seldom seen in said instrument ( in an effort to scare off those so inclined from working on modifications ) . But I digress . More acrobatics are introduced , as well . Where JO stopped after wall-running and - jumping , which , whilst commonly attributed to The Matrix , I am willing to maybe accept isn't just , you know , trying to capitalize on the success of something recent and popular , because I'm not certain that it originated with the Wachowski brothers ' film ( in fact , I've seen signs of that not being the case ) , and it maybe isn't the last thing a Jedi , Dark or Light , would do . This time . . . they add running up ( further than that of the JO one , which remains in the game ) a wall leading into a jump backwards , and " sticking " to a wall momentarily ( going so far as to even striking the pose ) , then automatically jumping back down . . . yes , Spiderman . As in , popular release of 2002 . Nevermind the fact that they're useful ( yes , they are , I'm not trying to deny that ) , that's too obvious to ignore , and a really cheap , easy strategy for getting your game attention . A long jump also finds its way into the game , and it's hardly useful anywhere . On that which is not useful . . . all the Force Powers are now in the single-player portion , and you can choose between all eight ( the Light / Dark ones , the neutral and saber ones are upgraded automatically ) , and they aren't all equally helpful , so you may wind up using those that are it the least . The Powers are tweaked , the result of which varies ( and depends on how you prefer them to be ) . Someone on the boards remarked that they didn't realize how much they liked puzzles until playing JA . Yeah , there aren't many ( if any ) , at all . The game-play is still entertaining , but perhaps more tedious ( in spite of plenty efforts to keep it fresh , within levels ) . Bugs / glitches are plentiful , varying in severity . You don't need to know the other games before playing this . You should have watched the films , in particular the OT . I recommend this to fans of JO , and anyone wanting FPS / Third-person-action set in the Star Wars galaxy .
450671	2093818	124295	8.0	Exposing the indifference that is the core of corporate America	The earliest of Moore's films I've seen so far , this is definitely not his best work . . . technically , this is the least impressive of the ones I've seen ( the others are Bowling For Columbine and Fahrenheit ) . The editing , pacing and presentation just isn't as sharp or clean as the other two . The score isn't as ironic or fitting either . The humor , tone and ' direction ' is just as good , though . This time , Moore takes a clean shot at corporate America , and clearly exposes the indifference of the common man's fate displayed by all executives . Several times in the documentary we're introduced to companies that , despite of high profits and no problems with their workers are laying people off , closing and moving factories . . . putting people out of work , effectively robbing them of their livelihood . As usual , it's done in Moore's fashion of outlining the facts that support his cause and denying or ignoring the ones that do not . Of course , he gets so many laughs throughout that you barely notice it . . . and what he says is true , at least to a certain extent . The interviews in which Moore asks all the right questions , usually very controversial and direct are inter-cut with what appears to be a stand-up performance by him , which adds a sense of closeness that means a lot for the effect of the film . Not as memorable and interesting as Bowling or Fahrenheit , but most definitely worth watching . I recommend this to any fan of Michael Moore and humorous documentaries .
450178	2093818	204798	8.0	When a licensed game works	Ah yes , it is , I suppose , a sad , but definite truth . . . licensed video-games are seldom of particularly high quality . We all know it , us gamers ( even those of us who perhaps sometimes deceive ourselves into thinking otherwise , in wanting a game of a recent flick , a comic book , etc . , and wanting it to be an accomplishment . . . yours truly admits openly to being guilty as charged of that ) . No , rather , they tend to be rushed messes which try ( ultimately failing , on account of lacking real substance ) to win over the player by throwing a bunch of references to what the original is at them , in uneven amounts and without properly developed material . The Disney games aren't all good , either . . . the one for The Lion King has levels that make somewhat little sense , just to name one . To name another , the quality of Hercules was , overall , just above average . But this one . . . this one , is a different matter . This is one of both those types , and it actually works , in both respects , and never really lets you down . The plot follows that of the movie , most of the way , adding some to make up for what had to be taken out ( not all of the film could be turned into a game , at least of this type ) , but it all makes sense . And there aren't really any bad parts to the game . I should perhaps point out that this review could reveal details about the animated musical original that may be best experienced by watching that . The music used consists of so-called midi versions of some of the songs of the feature ( usually the song used in the scene , since that does , obviously , make the most sense ) , including One Jump Ahead , and this works quite well . The sound isn't bad , if perhaps somewhat sparse , but I'm not sure more was really missed . The game is a platform action game , and has you running , jumping , crouching , and occasionally , climbing , around as the title character himself , and for fighting purposes , for dispensing some Middle-Eastern punishment upon the enemies , such as those pesky guards ( who do seem to be stationed just about everywhere in the kingdom . . . or is it sultanate ? Whatever ) . . . fear not , for he is brandishing a sword with two possible attacks , one stronger than the other , and , for some reason , apples for throwing ( in the movie , Al is considerably less decadent , and does not , in fact , waste food ) . However , not to spoil it , but the magic carpet will also make appearances , as will Abu . The Genie appears in multiple forms throughout , to aid your quest . One thing that helps are the countless great references to the movie , which with no real exceptions are well-integrated and fit in , taking you into the universe and making it interactive , rather than coming off phony and forced . The levels are all based on material in the film , and in addition to the obvious and more or less direct translations , such as the Agrabah Market and the exhilarating Rug Ride , there are such levels as the Desert ( where you must seek out the Golden Scarab ) , Jafar's Quarters ( complete with Iago , who appears what I suppose is an inordinate amount of times ) and a level inside of the lamp , the latter full to the very brim of Genie and his magic in various forms , as seen in the feature . Level design is nicely done , for the very most part , with backgrounds and details from the film , mixed in with original material that fits in the universe as presented . There are a few boss enemies here and there , and they're varied in how they attack and how you must defeat them . The graphics are great , the animation being done by actual Disney animators , and looking almost entirely like that of the movie , throughout . The color scheme is marvelous , and the visuals quite good . The action and game-play are really good , with you being able to attack from almost any position or situation ( climbing a rope , jumping , ducking , etc . ) , and the levels being fun to explore and run through . There are secrets enough to keep you coming back to the game , and tons of bonuses and stuff to pick up and find . Granted , the game won't take you but a few hours , but given that there is no saving outside of the levels ( there are save-points in most levels ) , you will have to start the entire game over if you lose one too many times , and if or when that happens , you will be grateful that it's no longer than it is ( and right after you've beaten it , your fingers will , as well ) . It doesn't overstay its welcome , either , and it's great fun while it lasts . I can't help but suggest to anyone wanting to play this to watch or re-watch ( it is one that makes for going back to ) the film in connection with playing . It helps you see just how many things they managed to put into the game , and how expertly lifted from the feature they were . The difficulty settings ensure that most people can play it , regardless of how skilled a player you are , and that it can still provide a challenge for the veterans . The levels get increasingly more difficult to complete , and you get less help and have a harder time finding the helpful items , and enough of them , the further you get . There is no real AI to speak of , but the enemies and environments do pose genuine threats to the survival of the popular Arabic thief , and the probability of him being successful in saving the Princess , defeating the Grand Vizier Jafar , and thwarting his evil scheme . The adventure is definitely a thrilling , satisfying and entertaining one . The game is perhaps dated now , but it was magnificent when it came out , and it still holds up well , and surpasses ones released later . If you like the feature , Disney , platform games , one , several or all of the aforementioned , you may very well enjoy this fine piece of work . I recommend this to anyone who fits that .
451000	2093818	99077	8.0	Beautiful	I hadn't really seen any other movies by Penny Marshall before watching this . The only one I'm sure I've seen is Riding in Cars with Boys , and , well , if you've read my review of that one , you'll know I didn't think very much of it . Looking at her filmography , I think this is the best of the films she's directed , quality-wise . The plot is great , and very well-told . The pacing is pretty much spot-on . The acting is all top-notch . De Niro is astounding . My fiancée remarks that it made her forget the stereotypical " De Niro roles " , Cape Fear's Max Cady and the various ( and more often than not , interchangeable ) gangster roles that he's played . Personally , I'd also say that Anthony J . Nici was a good choice for the young Leonard Lowe . I think he looks remarkably like him ( right down to the mole . . . added or not ) , and he does fine acting , as well . Williams shows that he can make us feel , as well as make us laugh , once again . The music is really good , songs are well-chosen . The editing is very good throughout . Most of the camera-work is , as well , although the zoom-ins don't work in the least . Very engaging and sad film . I recommend this to any fan of drama and / or the actors involved .
450465	2093818	95631	8.0	Quite good , if very 80's	From the moment I heard of this film , I knew I had to watch it . . . a buddy comedy pairing up Charles Grodin and Robert De Niro , that's simply too good , to golden an idea to miss . As expected , Grodin's deadpan and matter-of-fact humor compliments De Niro's hot-headed , sarcastic witty humor perfectly . The plot is interesting , though the pace seemed odd to me . It gets going faster than you'd expect it to , and then proceeds to take it's good time getting to where it's going . Maybe it's just too long since I've seen a movie of this period . There's no doubt about it ; the film is very 80's . Around half-way through the film , I thought to myself : " There is no doubt as to the fact that this movie was made in the same decade as The Blues Brothers . " It starts out 80's , continues 80's and ends 80's . The music , the tone , the dialog . . . everything . Any fan of the movies and culture of those years should love it . Heck , I'm not . . . and I thought it was pretty darn great . The score consists heavily of jazz and blues , which both fits and just sounds , well , damn good . The action is somewhat . . . well , close to non-existent , but that's not what this film is about . It's about the characters - the people we follow . True , only the two main characters are well-developed . . . but they all seemed credible , and what back-story was provided was excellent . The acting is all good . The humor mostly works . . . though there were two characters who seemed to only be there to provide comic relief , and of the worst kind . They were inexplicably daft , and this was just hit on every single time we see them . . . no depth whatsoever to them . Some of the jokes and gags try too hard to be funny , and a few are added in at points in the movie that are too busy , too much going on for us to find them funny . To the director and the writer , I say this : Remember , less is more . You can't cram in jokes wherever . Like action , humor needs pacing and timing to work . Finally , De Niro fools the same character not once , not twice , but three times with the exact same trick . It turns out to be a setup , but still . Still , this is one of the best films of its kind , and it's a lot better than many , if not necessarily all ( The Blues Brothers and Trading Places definitely top it ) 80's comedies . I recommend this film to most people who can enjoy a film that is a little older than brand new . . . it has , most definitely , aged quite well . Watch it for De Niro , watch it for Grodin , watch it for some good laughs and a good film experience ( thought it would be a lie to say that it's exceptionally well-made , from a purely technical standpoint ) .
450682	2093818	340398	8.0	Great action . . . about as good as Ambush	After watching all of the The Hire BMW commercials , I'm still considering the first , Ambush , my favorite . But I must say , this one comes damn close . It has great action , a pretty good plot and very good acting by all involved . The cameos by Ray Liotta and Robert Patrick are a nice touch . The only thing I didn't like in this was the twist . . . when we find out what's inside the suitcase . That is a little lame . . . and overly ' good guy ' , I think . Apart from that , though , the commercial is very cool and intense . I like the way the story was told , jumping a bit back and forth in time , throughout the entire thing . . . that worked exceptionally well . I haven't seen any other films by Joe Carnahan , but if any of them are as action-packed and intense as this one , I might have to check out some of his other work . While I can't say too much about his acting talent in general , I think Don Cheadle did a pretty good job in this . Clive Owen is , as usual , great as The Driver . F . Murray Abraham is charismatic as always . While this is not the best of the commercials , it is very good , and definitely worth watching . I recommend it to fans of the commercials and action films .
450943	2093818	175880	8.0	Heavy-handed and slow , but not without its moments and definitely interesting	When George C . Scott was approached for a part in this film and shown the script , he exclaimed " The language is terrible . " I disagree . The language is real . The dialog is true-to-life . We don't , or , very rarely , at least , always say the right thing , and we often repeat ourselves and say stupid , pointless things when making a point or being in a situation we can't control . Contrary to what you might think , this doesn't mean that the dialog is tedious . It may take some getting used to , but you realize that it is much better than typical Hollywood dialog . . . because words don't convey our emotions the same way body-language and behavior does . Writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson obviously knew that , and used it in this film . I haven't seen any of his other work , but I will . Now , this film is character-driven , and that is its biggest strength , and its main reason for failing in some parts . It's a long film , but it's not overlong ( maybe a little in the end , but the first two hours are hardly ever boring ) . It's a film with non-Hollywood dialog , but this is just something to get used to . The problem lies undeniably in the character-driven nature of the film . Some big films have many , many characters . This one , however , has many , many main characters . This means that there are about 15 people that you have to remember , learn of , and follow throughout the three-hour run-time of this film . This means that you probably won't be able to pick up everything on the first viewing , and , more importantly , there will most likely be at least one character that you dislike , maybe even strongly . This makes every scene with them hard to sit through , and their very presence in the movie can make you annoyed with it . For me , it was Jim Kurring . He was just so pitifully annoying and unbearable . He can't tolerate ' bad language ' , he has the most annoying blind faith , and he just seems generally retarded . What's worse is his narration and his lack of charm or charisma . He's the guy you avoid in real life , but act nice around because you don't want him to know how badly you hate him . The film has some very heavy-handed symbolism and some seemingly pointless scenes , that could easily have been written out or cut with no real effect on the film . I enjoyed the first two thirds considerably more than the last . The scenes near the end . . . I won't put what happens here , but it just seemed pointless and stupid . The film didn't seem to have a real ending . . . nothing is really resolved . No questions answered , no solutions given . It's basically just a story about all of these people , and that's it . I don't know if I expected the ending of the film to hold some major surprise ( well , that it did , I admit ) or an explanation , but it just seemed kind of pointless in the end . " But it did happen . " Yes , but why ? Are we supposed to take some moral lesson out of all of this , or is it just a study of different persons and strange coincidences ? What makes a magnificent drama , I think , is if it offers a commentary on something that we all know , or pushes through an important point . . . One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has the beautiful message of freedom and fighting for it , Citizen Kane shows how important love is to any man . . . but what does this movie show ? What message is it trying to convey ? I can't seem to pin-point it . Maybe I need to think more about the film . . . maybe there is none . That doesn't make it a bad drama , but it prevents it from being a truly remarkable one , I think . The plot is very good and well-written . The pacing is good , at least for the first two hours . . . after that , it seemed to slide a little downwards . The acting is flawless . Absolutely flawless . From the biggest star to the least seen extra . . . not one performance was unsatisfactory . Not even the child actors . The characters are well-written and credible . All in all , a very good drama , but not a perfect one and not as impressive as some shorter films . I recommend it to fans of dramas , but I will say that it takes some effort from the viewer to enjoy and it is kind of an acquired taste . It's also a bit slow , after the first two hours .
450540	2093818	120324	8.0	Dark , intense thriller by Sam Raimi . . . about as good as it gets , really	A very , very dark movie , A Simple Plan manages to be thoroughly interesting and intense , keeps you guessing how it'll end until the end and mostly keeps you on the edge of your seat . The plot is very good , and something everyone can relate to . What would you do if you found several million dollars ? The pace is good for the most part . The characters are well-written and credible throughout . They are also interesting and easy to relate to , in one way or the other . The acting is great ; the four leads , Paxton , Fonda , Thornton and Briscoe all give excellent performances . Most of the supporting characters are well-acted too . The mood of the film is great , and the atmosphere is very , very dark . Most of the mainstream fans probably shouldn't see this , as it can definitely be too much for some people . The ending is very dark and can be depressing ( I can imagine ) . The very end seems to whisper three little words in your inner ear ; Crime doesn't pay . The film really shows how affected regular people can be by greed and the desire for something more than they have . I guess it just goes to show that one should be happy with what he has . The film is good , very good . . . possibly even great . But it does have a few flaws and shortcomings . About halfway through the film , the pace seemed to slow down a little , and there was nearly fifteen minutes where it seemed like nothing really happened . A few parts of it also seemed to be a little more about shocks and intensity than logic . . . which is forgivable , of course . . . this is a movie , after all . . . but it does drag down a little , both in entertainment value and in overall rating . A very good film that only falls a little short . . . but it's worth watching just for the non-preachy morale and dark mood . Very good thriller by Raimi . I found it a bit interesting that Raimi's fascination with Hitchcock shone so much through . . . particularly obvious with the crows . I recommend this to any fan of Raimi , any one of the actors or of dark movies and thrillers in general . Just be prepared ; it's fairly disturbing .
450299	2093818	348150	8.0	Astounding , if slightly overlong , superhero film	I watched this shortly after viewing the ' 78 film . Within half an hour of the end credits rolling of that , the opening ones of this came on . Therefore , I have an unusually clear memory ( and basis of comparison ) of the first . From the first frame ( literally . . . as the credits roll at the beginning of the film ) , I could tell that Singer is a definite fan of the original . As the film progressed , it was also proved without a doubt that he's a fan of the character . For a revival film , for restarting a franchise , this couldn't really have been much better of a superhero / Superman movie ( as far as I can tell , from my non-fan view , and having only seen the first film prior to this ) . The in-jokes and references to the first are quite funny , if there are arguably a tad too many of them . The plot is well-written , explains the various changes and developments nicely . . . and I , for one , love the way it uses the first as a starting point . The acting is all good . Routh is fitting as both Superman and Clark Kent . Bosworth seemed too young a Lois Lane to me . Kevin Spacey basically is Lex Luthor . There was less energy put in his performance than the trailer suggested , which is a shame , but he's still marvelous . Posey provides some good comic relief and shows off some of her somewhat seldom seen acting talent . The characters are fairly well-developed . Kent is less clumsy here . The pacing is solid . There are drawn-out scenes , but the action more than makes up for them . . . and I was never actually bored or hoping it would end soon ( though I will admit that the film may be as much as half an hour too long ) . The cinematography is quite good . . . the camera takes on a panicky shaking during several of the intense scenes , but it never really seems overdone . The action is exciting and breathtaking . The visuals are stunning . . . the effects are amazing . You truly will believe that a man can fly . Yes , one or two of the subplots may have been unnecessary , but the end result , what it all comes down to , is a pretty solid film . You can watch this without having seen any of the others , though I would recommend watching the first . . . first . I recommend this to any fan of the character , of superhero films in general and / or of the 1978 movie . Highly enjoyable .
450142	2093818	56869	8.0	Incredible Hitchcock film . . . more scary than most other horror films	Hitchcock has a unique film style ; no one can do exactly what he does when directing horror films . His talent is especially obvious in this film ; all the nice little touches , the old typical Hitchcock details ( controlling mother , minor romance between male and female main characters , strong-willed , powerful female main character , etc . ) are beautifully and discreetly put into the film , without in any way distracting from the main plot or disturbing the natural cycle of the film . I like how Hitchcock , as with several other of his big films ( Psycho immediately comes to mind ) starts with one story , that has nothing in particular to do with the source of the terror . The movie starts with a certain story , that has nothing to do with the actual horror of the film , and ends with that story still present , instead of just flat-out starting the film with a story about birds attacking people . There are hints and a lot of foreshadowing from the very minute that the movie starts , but it's not the main theme of the film until the last fourth part . The plot is pretty good , interesting and developing consistently throughout the movie . The actors all perform very well , with no exceptions . The characters are believable , and their actions are mostly entirely understandable . In fact , I found it far more psychologically realistic , in how it portrays the different characters emotional reactions to the situations . The special effects are amazing ; the film is more than forty years old and the effects look very dated today , but it still scared me more than I could have possibly imagined . I don't think I'll look at a bird the same way ever again . Another masterpiece from the master of suspense . I recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind watching a film that isn't entirely new , and who are looking for a good scare . I have a hard time imagining anyone not being scared by this film .
450231	2093818	80801	8.0	Innocence meets Benny Hill-esquire slapstick in a very sweet film	Comedy is an art that can take many forms , and can be seen more places than more or less any other . Almost anywhere you search , you may find it by looking closely . Many would argue that slapstick reminiscent of the late Benny Hill isn't the greatest expression of the comedic arts , but it's difficult to dispute that it's one that anyone understands ( if not everyone will find it funny ) . Here , that type of humor is meshed ( and with quite good results ) with the innocence of Bushmen who have never seen modern society . There are three story lines ; following Xixo , a Bushman who has technology thrust upon him in the form of an object common in civilization , Andrew Steyn , a young man who works in Botswana ( where the whole film is set ) and a malevolent man fighting the government . These story lines run parallel each other very well , and the overall plot is rather good , for the production . The pacing is relatively even , and the movie neither moves too fast nor too slowly . The comedy is almost all in the form of the slapstick , and there is occasional cleverness in the dialog . It all goes together well , and makes for a very funny movie . The innocence and the general tone of the film makes it very sweet ( without being sappy ) , and though few will make the claim that it is an unpredictable piece , it's a nice little film , one to take your mind off bad things and just relax ( in-between the laughing ) . An inexpensive movie that doesn't look cheap . The humor is very well balanced ; it never tries too hard , and it is almost invariably successful at getting the laughs . Seeing Xixo be introduced to modern conveniences , and respond with the naiveté ( which is perfectly accentuated by the narrator ) is heartening , and watching how he adapts to it is a testament to human ingenuity . A simple film , but one that can be watched by just about anyone at any time . The slapstick does get a little violent at times , but it's cartoon-y violence ( think Tom and Jerry ) . It shows little actual consequence of violent actions . . . for better or for worse . I recommend this to any fan of slapstick and physical comedy . Very good for what it is .
450213	2093818	382007	8.0	They've still got it	Utterly devoid of taste , this sketch of a mere six minutes is so rich in material , both as far as amount , and as how solid it is , go . The jokes are based around sex education , corporate " ethics " , and the Python zaniness that we know and love . Unless you completely disagree with the viewpoint openly and continually expressed by the second source of gags mentioned , and / or are offended by sexual comedy , or , I guess if you aren't a fan of the Monty Python crew and their brand of humor , you are highly likely to love and thoroughly enjoy this , as I most certainly did . The pacing is spot-on , there is some repetition , but not too much . Three of the Pythons join forces and bring us this all-new sketch , including Cleese . It's well-edited and nicely , if simply ( but it doesn't require complexity in how it's put together , the strength lies in the verbal work , the delivery ) , done . This was released on the second disc of the ( surprise surprise ) 2-Disc release of The Meaning of Life , in 2003 . I would definitely say to give it a watch , if you're a fan of the Pythons and you have the DVD ( if you don't , consider getting it , it's well worth it for , yes , again , fans ) . I recommend this to any fan of Monty Python .
450223	2093818	228333	8.0	Great action , excellent horror	This is how to make a hybrid of action , horror and science fiction . John Carpenter knows exactly how to set a mood , and , as proved by this film , also knows how to direct good action . The plot is not really new , but it's not a story that's been done to death either . The actors all perform pretty well , considering that most of them are B-list actors . The special effects are great . The music is perfect for the film ; John Carpenter knows the importance of a good score . The atmosphere is incredible ; any fan of Carpenter's earlier work will at the very least enjoy it . The film is exciting and scary at the same time ; a thing most other films can't accomplish . The action is well-choreographed and cool . The story is told in a reasonably original fashion , and it works perfectly . The pacing is great . The humor is very dark and cynical , and fits perfectly with the overall mood of the film ; very good decision by Carpenter . I'd recommend this to any fan of action , horror , science fiction or John Carpenter . Just keep an open mind about it ; it's a bit different from what you might expect from these genres .
450980	2093818	165798	8.0	Interesting and deep , but not as deep as it tries to be	This is a great film ; it has pretty much everything a great film needs : a great score , great actors , great performances , etc . The film revolves around Ghost Dog , perfectly portrayed by Forest Whitaker . He is a assassin who lives by the code of the Samurai . Apart from him , we also follow the fate of several mafia men ( though nowhere near as intimately as we follow Ghost Dog ) . These two very different groups , Samurai and mafia , are both depicted reasonably well , giving us insight to how the groups work , and , more importantly , their code . Both groups live and die by the code , and this is probably the most important thing in the movie , and it's shown with respect with both Samurai and mafia ; I'm not entirely sure that it's correct all the way through , but that's not what's most important , anyway . The film has reasonably little action , but it's not supposed to be an action film , by any means . It's fairly slow throughout the film , but it never really bores you to the point of not watching any more ; I've seen the film at least five times now , so believe me , I know . The film is very stylized and cool throughout , which definitely has some part in keeping you interested , but the theme and story / plot plays a bigger part , I think . The plot is pretty good , and though it keeps a fairly slow pace throughout the film , it also keeps your interest for the entire duration of the film . The acting is all good , though not everyone pulls off as excellent a performance as Whitaker . Isaach De Bankolé portrays Ghost Dog's best friend , and he does gives a great performance . So does Camille Winbush , who portrays a girl who Ghost Dog befriends and discusses books with . The characters are well-written and ( mostly ) credible . I'm not entirely sure that the film does provide a totally correct version of the Code of the Samurai . The soundtrack is great ; it's made by the hip-hop artist RZA , but most of it will be enjoyable to people who aren't into hip-hop . Also , I guess it's more of a score than a soundtrack ; there isn't any time where the music feels out of place in a scene . All in all , a great film , but not for all tastes . Don't go in expecting an action film ; don't go in expecting a very deep an entirely intellectual film ; don't go in expecting a regular movie ; go in expecting to see a decent ( if not good ) representation of both the mafia code and the Samurai code . I've heard some people describe the ending as an anti-climax ; I don't know what they were expecting . . . I won't say that I saw it coming , but I wasn't disappointed when it happened . It had to end it , and I think the director , Jim Jarmusch made a good decision on that . I recommend this film to people with an interest in Samurai , fans of Jarmusch and people looking for a reasonably deep film . I don't recommend this to fans of action movies , as there's fairly little action in the film . No matter who you are , if you're going to see this film , make sure you have the patience for it ; it's worth sitting through the two reasonably slow hours for .
450059	2093818	486130	8.0	Great	This is a making-of-type featurette on Jul på Vesterbro , obviously located on the DVD of that . The majority of it is one big in-joke , that everyone is in on , and that the audience immediately can figure out , and this works remarkably well . They do slip out of it on the occasions where keeping it up would impair their ability to share things such as the film-making techniques with us . It consists of behind-the-scenes footage , interviews and some clips from the show . Everyone who speaks has something to add . On that , I have to wonder why Bossy Bo doesn't . . . say a word . Wouldn't one expect that a rapper could dish out quite a bit , in that department ? This is both funny and informational , with a staged sequence or two , and Anden's / The Duck's impressive improvising , and earlier mentioned " playing along " getting countless laughs , and this also containing plenty of details on how they achieved certain effects ( you even get to watch Matthesen's stunt ) . The editing gets top marks all the way , in particular the ending of this documentary is perfect . There are spoilers , I would say , so one may wish to save this until having watched every episode of the Christmas calendar ( why they put it on the first disc is not a decision I can explain ) . It's just under half an hour , and well worth the time . This has language , themes and descriptions ( not technically any violence or sexuality , apart from in the dialog ) of the kind also found in the X-mas effort and other material by Anders . I recommend this to any fan of him and / or the subject of this extra .
450347	2093818	462272	8.0	Excellent , worth owning for every fan	This DVD features seven videos by Eminem . . . in order , they are : Stan , The Way I Am , The Real Slim Shady , Role Model , Guilty Conscience , My Name Is and Just Don't Give A F . . . and two bonus presentations , a making of for the video of Stan , and something called The Mathers ' Home . I won't give away what the last thing is , it should be realized by anyone who watches it as they do ( it'll become evident within seconds ) . I'll just say that it was a great idea , and they executed it rather expertly . The " making of " has Dre and director Atwell talking to the camera some ( the former makes a very bad pun at one point ) , as well as Devon Sawa ( of Final Destination fame ) , who plays Stan , and Dido . It goes behind several of the things they did in the video , and at about 8 and a half minutes , it doesn't overstay its welcome , or really lose momentum . The videos themselves come to about half an hour , give or take some minutes . The other Special Feature lasts about five minutes , give or take . In total , it will come to almost fifty minutes . The DVD offers regular stereo sound , and Dolby Digital , and has no subtitles . I base this on the Region 2 release . The visuals are all crisp and high quality . The videos themselves , I personally think , are all good ( if not all equally ) . Stan is a great rap , and a rather good video , as well , of high story-telling quality . The Way I Am . . . what can I say ? Is there one single fan of Em who doesn't love that song , and the video for it , as well ? It is well deserved . The mixing in of the Steve Berman skit on The Marshall Mathers LP for the opening . . . magnificent , both in idea and execution . The Real Slim Shady is fun and funny , if the appearance of Bugz is perhaps sad , now . . . R . I . P . Proof , you too , R . I . P . , and take care , Marshall , you guys seemed close . Role Model is similarly funny , and , like Stan and The Way I Am , has him making fun of the parents and critics who call him a menace , if not as bitingly satirical as Stan , or as angry as The Way I Am . Guilty Conscience is a good video , and features some nice effects , though I'm personally not crazy about the chorus they put in it , albeit I can understand why . My Name Is , even if he has later come to hate it , is another fun song , and the social commentary and attitude is evident throughout . Just Don't Give A F is a fine finish , with the gritty , angry tone . The menus are nicely done . This is definitely worth it for any fan of the rapper and his music , in my seldom humble opinion . I recommend it to anybody who falls into aforementioned category , and warmly so .
450796	2093818	252337	8.0	One of the original RTS games . . . and arguably the one fathering the biggest franchise of such	Before I commence with this review , I must regrettably inform anyone reading that due to game-crashing bugs that I have been unable to work around ( yup , in both campaigns ) , I have not finished this game recently . . . so my review will be based in part what I've played of it over the last few days , which makes up about half of the game put together , and what I remember of playing it back when it was new . This came out around the time of StarCraft ( don't believe the year on that game's IMDb listing ; 1998 was the year that marked the release of Brood War , the expansion pack , not the original game , which came out four years earlier ) , so comparisons are logical to draw . One of the first things that you will find this has that StarCraft doesn't is areal damage . This has flames , grenades and explosions . . . whereas in the futuristic RTS title , you either attack a certain object . . . or don't attack at all . True , some damage can affect more than one target . . . such as the blast of the Siege Tank . . . but this has a much smoother and more versatile engine for such . In both games , most of the stuff in-between levels is briefings , with occasional cut-scenes that tell back-story , further the plot . . . or just plain look cool . Blizzard's game had the looser , more colorful style ( possibly due to the science fiction genre of it ) , where even the humans were animated , and Westwood's . . . that would be this one . . . was more realistic and natural . Sure , we can tell today that it was green-screened , and the CGI no longer has as much of an effect . . . but it was an ambitious project , and the drive still clearly comes through . Playing this after one has played the later Command & Conquer titles ( yup , it's not only the title of this , the first game . . . but also the franchise as a whole , including the ones that take place in different " universes " than this one ) , you miss some of the later features and such . . . but once you get used to it , you find that this had more than enough to keep you entertained , and most of the features that people love about these games were present right from the start . Selecting multiple troops and assigning the squads numbers , the radar window ( which has a zoom feature that I'm afraid did not last long in this franchise ) , great scenarios . . . not to mention the cool units , awesome style , and the music . To take them in the order I've just mentioned . . . you've got the grenadier , and the flame-thrower , to name one from each side , both of which can hit several units with a single attack , but which are also dangerous to keep in clusters , because if one goes , his arsenal goes with him . . . his fellow soldiers burning up with him ( War is the H-word , as the Futurama episode title goes ) , several cool tanks which pack a punch but of course also move slower than the less armored and armed vehicles , and last but most definitely not least , the Commando , who can take out enemy troops in a single shot , and blow buildings up with explosives . The style is not overdone , but rather very easy to take in , and you feel as though you're in a cool alternate world , or possibly just in the not too distant future . And the music . . . adrenaline-pumping techno to get you in the war-waging mood , with around a dozen diverse pieces . The missions are all very good , and the difficulty of them increases as it should . Many objectives will seem relatively similar , but the many different level designs help to keep things interesting . After each level , the game lists percentages for how many of your own men you kept alive as well as how many of the enemy's you neutralized , as well as the same for buildings and a count of how many credits you had left at the completion of the level , and a time for how long it took you . There's a top 10 list of scores that lets you put in your name , which , together with all the levels that there are several different versions of ( only one of which you may play each play-through ) keeps the re-playability quite high . The game also offers multi-player , over modem , internet or network . In this , as in other RTS titles , later C & C ones as well as StarCraft , you can play as both the good guys and the bad guys . . . the first being GDI , the Global Defense Initiative , who were established as peace-keepers and who seek to rid the world of terrorists , and The Brotherhood of NOD , a religious cult that wish to control the planet ( you know they've got serious megalomania when their barracks ( named The Hand of NOD ) is a large hand with the world in its palm ) and rule it according to their beliefs . Now , when you play as NOD , you will find that the leader makes a rather powerful entrance when you first see him ; his name is Kane , and he's got charisma and screen presence enough for several dozen warlords , each one more brilliant than the last . Joseph D . Kucan portrays him , and he is . . . incidentally . . . also the man behind these games . Whenever Kane makes an appearance in any of these games , Kucan is the one doing the acting . And whenever he is on screen , he has your attention . The actors are all fairly good , but he stands out as the best . Now , I'm afraid there are also a few things about this game that are negative . . . the AI , for example , could have used some work . The AI programming is about the same as StarCraft , all in all . . . each has good and bad points . The plot and story-telling is quite good , especially for a game from the mid-nineties . While ID Software were busy making bleak monsters for players to blast away , Westwood were doing well-done cinematics with CGI . I recommend this to any fan of the franchise as well as people who just plain enjoy RTS gaming . Cool , fun and well done .
450939	2093818	230600	8.0	Brilliant , and almost sublime . . . a masterful work within the genre of psychological horror-thriller	As I write this moments after the second viewing of the film , I can say without a doubt that this is one of those rare films that benefit greatly from being watched more than once by any viewer . Having been very interested in the work of director / writer / composer Alejandro Amenábar basically since I first knew of Abre Los Ojos , after watching the Americanized remake with Cameron Crowe at the helm ( and much , much more upon actually watching some of his work ) , I made sure to watch this as soon as I could . I remember being gripped and never really looking away . . . and astoundingly , I had much the same reaction this time , as well . This time , I noticed all the little hints along the way . . . all leading towards the shocking and intelligent twist . Anyone who hasn't seen this , I urge you to avoid hearing what it is , and make sure not to read neither the quotes nor the keywords for the film . And yes , it is somewhat similar to another popular movie ( which I haven't and don't intend to see ) , but a movie doesn't have to be 100 % original to be excellent . The plot is incredibly well-written , and it develops exactly as it should . The pacing is perfect . You're never bored and the film never hurries to get where it's going . The acting is flawless , quite simply . As far as Kidman and the other adults go , this is no major surprise , but the children . . . they are quite simply among a far too small group of extraordinarily talented young actors . The cinematography is breathtaking . The editing is masterful . Something that simply must be mentioned is the lighting . . . the way it almost becomes a character itself , the way it affects everything else , the way it is played with throughout the film . Explaining the lighting as well as the general isolation is the fact that the two children suffer from a tragic illness . . . they cannot survive sunlight . What is amazing that throughout the course of the film , you get used to this . . . the darkness , the thick atmosphere ; it becomes every-day life . Near the end , you find yourself fearing the sun . . . the bright light . Featuring no real gore , blood or violence , the horror is all psychological . The atmosphere and the light ( or lack thereof ) creates a lot of tension and suspense . . . and all of it pays off so well . There are no false scares , nothing gratuitous and the whole film is very close to being sublime . Now , to the real problem with this film , at least my problem with it . . . it's simply not as open as the other works of Alejandro . It's more Hollywood , easier to take in . Instead of challenging you to think , of providing food for thought , questions as opposed to answers ( as Amenábar himself has commented that his films are about ) . . . it reveals everything at the end . It leaves little , if anything , up to the viewer to decide or debate . All is explained . . . the very thing that ruined what potential the remake of his film , Abre Los Ojos . I understand trying to open up to a wider audience , but it's a little sad that he has to make a compromise with his integrity and goals in doing so . With that said , however , this is still not the average Hollywood flick ; there is still nothing in the film that is entirely superfluous , and almost every frame of it is perfection , pure and simple . I recommend this to any fan of Alejandro Amenábar , any of the actors and psychological horror / mystery-thrillers .
450803	2093818	416449	8.0	Stylized , adrenaline-filled awesomeness	Given that this was made so soon after Sin City , one cannot deny the possibility that a reason for making it was the popularity and widespread success of the aforementioned film . Both are based on comics of Frank Miller's . . . both are bloody , and packed with adrenaline and style . However , regardless of what may or may not have been in the minds of the producers , this movie is entertaining and fulfilling . Whilst not as well-rounded and perfectly executed as Sin City , it has plenty of action , cool shots and intensity to go around . I have not read the original comic book , so I cannot comment on how well this tells the story that Miller ( not the historians ; don't make the mistake of confusing this film for an actual account of events ! ) intended , but I can say that it pulls off the comic book feel pretty darn well . The visuals are simply stunning , and the movie is filled , just about to the very brink , with gorgeous designs and camera-work that amazes . The many boxes of text found in most comic books are translated to the medium of film with a narrator , and it works remarkably well . I was worried early on that the narrator would remain for all of the film . . . but I found it to not only mesh with the visuals but improve the overall experience . The music is part orchestrated score , and all fits exceptionally well . The pacing was flawless . The acting I found to be masterful for just about every part . The dialog varies , but the majority is good . The grandiose speeches and the serious tone of them is lightened pleasantly through occasional wit . The battles are massive , bad-ass and often quite bloody ( though there was less gore than I had expected . . . but I didn't mind ) . I would guess that big parts of the audience are comprised of people coming mainly for the battles , and I would say that most will leave the theater satisfied . The sequences of fighting are long , stylized , well-choreographed and wickedly cool . I found the rest of the movie to be interesting and engaging , and I wouldn't say that the fights are too long . One thing I really liked , and that got the movie and Frank Miller my respect , was the way the Spartan women were depicted : Strong , passionate and as full of courage and fortitude as the men . Whether or not this is historically accurate , I don't know , but that Miller and the movie would depict women that way is something I can only support and encourage . The movie was not perfect , however ; some shots were less spectacular than they could or should have been , and the last battle was perhaps a little disappointing . Still , this is a movie that I urge anyone who enjoys action , macho-ism and comic book style to watch . I strongly recommend this to any fan of comic books and any man into action .
450885	2093818	497116	8.0	Quite good	I'll freely admit that I didn't know much about Al Gore before I watched this . I have heard about global warming , and it is a subject that worries me . From I first heard of this , I wanted to watch it . Whilst the basic idea may sound dull . . . it can , with some truth , be described as a film of Gore showing a Power Point presentation . Granted , this is hardly an eventful piece ; there is little action and few developments . This is not a Michael Moore film ; we aren't bombarded with facts of varying degrees of truth , with a humorous , if smarmy , commentary . Al Gore calmly describes the problem , the misconceptions regarding it . . . and most importantly , the solutions . Yes , it is idealistic and it has an agenda . . . but it does not talk down to its audience , and the moral is one of world-wide interest . Gore has great charisma , and clearly believes very passionately in his cause . With fact-based argumentation , he describes many of the effects that the green-house effect may have , if we don't prevent it . There is even a small amount of humor , delivered perfectly , which doesn't detract or distract from the serious nature of the subject . There is almost no political content herein ; it is focused on the issue , which , as Gore points out , is a moral one . The editing and cinematography are subtle , and it feels more like simply watching Gore have the speech , attending his presentation . The credits roll as numerous pieces of advice on how to help , through simple , everyday actions appear on the screen , and rather than claiming that the battle is impossible to win , as so many who oppose the fight have , he ends the feature with naming the ways we can alter our lives to keep Earth around . Remarkable documentary , very worth watching . I recommend this to any fan of documentaries and anyone who has an opinion on this subject at all . . . whether or not you agree with Mr . Gore .
450680	2093818	338768	8.0	Weird , bizarre , stylish , funny and intense	When you've got Gary Oldman wearing a red spandex and red lipstick in the role of the devil and James Brown , godfather of soul himself , complaining that the deal he got with the prince of darkness needs to be renegotiated because he's gotten too old to do splits , you know you've divided everyone who hears about it into two clearly marked , separated groups ; those who reject it and those who are intrigued . Those that belong in the latter category probably wind up watching this commercial , are once again divided into two groups ; those who love it and those who hate it . This is a clear-cut short film ; either you love it or you hate it . But that doesn't mean that it's bad . . . just that it's limited . I don't know exactly why , but I'm thankful it is . Maybe it's because that allowed it to be what it wanted to be , what it had to be . What is that , you ask ? Well , bizarre as hell , first of all . But also funny and stylish , not to mention quite intense . The race in the commercial is cool and exciting . The humor is very good . . . again , limited , but very good if you're into exactly that sort of thing . . . and I am . To an extent , at least . I laughed out loud at the ' twist ' in the end . The editing and cinematography is very stylish , very typically Tony Scott . I liked all of the puns and jokes , both those concerning the devil himself and those concerning James Brown . The acting is good . Clive Owen once again delivers a perfect performance . All in all , just a very weird and bizarre yet entertaining little commercial . I recommend it to any fan of the commercials or any of the actors . . . and possibly fans of Tony Scott .
450333	2093818	87050	8.0	A lot better than I expected . . .	I have to admit , I usually hate Stephen King films . I've seen The Shining , Carrie and It . I hate all of those . But this one was really good . It was scary and atmospheric , all the way through . The music was great , very moody and scary , the basic theme was pretty good , and the acting was , if not great , sufficient . The effects were mostly good , though I thought the moving corn , was , well , corny ( no pun intended ) . It's interesting , all the way through , and has more likable main characters than your everyday horror movie . Both main characters are pretty well developed through the movie , and you actually care about them . This is a movie you should watch , at least once , if you like horror movies , even if you hate Stephen King ( I do , and I loved the movie ) .
449948	2093818	278731	8.0	Cronenberg does it again	After seeing every single Cronenberg film I've been able to find , I've come to one simple conclusion : I've seen entirely too little of his works . I have yet to see one film of his that I found a complete waste of time ( though I did not find much point in The Brood ) . This is quite possibly my favorite film of his yet , and I guess that says something about how few of his films I've seen ( as this seems like one of his more unappreciated films ) . The film is quite dark and bleak . It has a fairly slow pace , but there's plenty of atmosphere and I never really felt like turning it off . The plot is very good , and I liked the way it developed somewhat out of joint , with little continuity other than the main plot-line . The acting is superb . One actress performs two roles , and does so with such talent that I never realized they were being portrayed by one and the same person . I only discovered this after checking out the cast list . Spider is a very unsettling film , but I suppose Cronenberg has done far better in other films . For some reason , I just found this the more easily accessible of his films , the one that requires least afterthought to be understood , to decipher what he wanted to say . All of the other films by him that I've seen , I've required to basically ' be told ' what the film was about . . . with this one , I thought for a while after seeing it , and figured it out , put the pieces together myself , without much difficulty . Maybe that's a problem for the film . . . it's too simple . It's far more simple than the usual Cronenberg , and that is what makes me like it more , and his more experienced and analyzing fans like it less . I recommend this film to any fan of Cronenberg and / or dark films . Don't expect to be able to figure out the film from just one viewing , and don't take anything you see in it at face value .
450031	2093818	203667	8.0	Nice look on the making of The Shining	This is what Making Of DVD extras are supposed to be like ( or , at the very least , should be like ) : short , precise and to the point . Vivian Kubrick , the directors daughter , takes a camera and follows Nicholson around and interviews some of the actors , both during and after production about making the film and their opinion of Stanley Kubrick . Jack Nicholson was entertaining to watch , because though his characters are usually a lot like himself , it's kind of a rarity to see him really be himself . He flirts a little with Vivian , which must be considered either somewhat cute or deeply disturbing , seeing as he's old enough to be her father , and her actual father is nearby . Danny Lloyd is kind of cute to see interviewed . Shelley Duvall is interesting to listen to in the interviews . Scatman Crothers ' interview is inspirational , even though it only lasts a few seconds . Nicholson is the most interesting and gets the most time in this . What I really liked about it , though , what really made it interesting to me was seeing Kubrick work . He has a certain intensity , a concentration that I find inspirational and impressive , being a ( albeit on a much smaller scale ) film-maker myself . Seeing him directing , figuring out angles , and just going around between takes . . . you can feel his intensity and concentration all the way through . I recommend this to any fan of Kubrick or film-making in general . While not very technical , it provides a good look at what goes on behind the scenes on a film production .
450894	2093818	251474	8.0	A bold statement	Considering that this is a made-for-TV movie , it's actually very good . A few of the actors are well-known , but most are not . They all portray the respective character believably though , I especially think that Brooke Shields & Jordy Benattar gives excellent performances ; even Whoopi Goldberg did a great job . The plot is touching and interesting , and moves along at a pretty good rate . The acting is , like I mentioned a few lines up , very good , mostly . A few scenes seemed a little overly sentimental or less-than-fortunately acted , but that's only reasonably rarely , and it rarely ruins the mood . The characters were all well-written and , considering their respective personalities , they all act understandably for the entire movie . I really enjoyed the last few court scenes in the movie , and the moral questions they brought up . The entire movie presented the different moral questions very well , and really made you think . Unfortunately , it would seem that this movie , probably due to it being a TV movie , isn't very well-known , which is too bad , since it's actually very well-made for a TV movie . An excellent drama , that raises some very important questions . I recommend this to anyone who like dramas , especially dramas that pose such important moral questions .
450547	2093818	84726	8.0	Better	This is based on the Director's Edition . After the first being essentially a long ( no . . . really ) establishing piece , this takes charge , and does so right away . The pacing is improved , and this is more enjoyable . This uses an episode as a start-off point , and in general presumes the viewer is familiar with the franchise . I'm not sure this was the most interesting way to go from that particular one , but what they get out of it is good . I'm sure I will take a lot of flack for this , but it does seem a little like Gene having less control proved a positive , at least in this case . The plot is well-written . The themes are another positive . This is , as Star Trek is when at its best , about the characters , and they're consistently and credibly written , and they have something to do this time , if not equal amounts . The acting is great . Notable that they got the same performer . The effects are nice , convincing and well-done , and they never take over . The action isn't bad , ditto the tension and the humor . Not all situations are satisfyingly resolved , going by their potential and / or set-up . There is genuine violence in this , and children should not see this , to a greater degree than earlier . The language is pervasive again , though almost invariably still not overly harsh . Props to this for depicting actual space phenomena . This isn't as exquisite visually as its predecessor , but it is well-shot , and editing and cinematography are well-done . I recommend this to fans of Star Trek and thinking man's science fiction , and would suggest that , if nothing else , Space Seed be watched first .
449925	2093818	758774	8.0	Credibility	Ridley Scott is usually one you can depend on to make a good , sometimes fantastic , film , and it'll mostly be well-done . This definitely fits the last two mentioned qualities . The plot is impeccably well-written , and keeps developing very well throughout . The pacing is flawless , it moves fast but never overwhelms , and manages to occasionally slow down , yet always maintains enough speed to keep you interested . The characters are well-written and memorable . The acting is beyond reproach , I see not a single performance that I could complain about . Mark Strong was particularly excellent . The realism is kept immensely high , and there are almost no Hollywood moments in the entirety . The story-telling is masterful , no time is wasted whatsoever , nothing is present that is unnecessary or doesn't serve a purpose . The cinematography and editing are careful and effective . This shows the Arab culture in a neutral light at certain parts , and actually features spoken Arabic , in nice amounts , which I would say should earn it recognition ( in addition to all else I've mentioned in this review ) . I would say that this is a thriller-drama , with action elements . . . do not watch it expecting constant car-chases or shootings , albeit it is surely intense . It brings up several well-stated and solid points , for and against several sides , and offers food for thought . There is near-constant language , and it is always moderate or more . Also , there is a lot of violence and a little sheer brutality , and it is not for the faint of heart . I recommend this to any fan of the people involved in making it , not the least of whom the director , and I again state that it is not a popcorn flick .
449842	2093818	49406	8.0	Even then , he was excellent	I watched this entirely based on whom I knew helmed it . I have not read the novel , and was in fact not aware of its existence until I read that this was based on a book . This is the earliest of Stanley's movies that I've seen at this time . I have to say , as far back as this point in his career , the man knew what he was doing . This is a masterfully done noir crime-thriller , in stark black and white , that will have your attention from start to finish . Its impact on cinema is still felt today . I am here mainly referring to one specific aspect of it in particular . The narration can be a tad excessive , but you can find out where the blame lies for that by reading the Trivia ( though I urge you to not read all of it until after at least your initial viewing of it ) . The dialog , however , fits perfectly , offers quotable lines , and is impeccably thought up as well as delivered . The acting in general is fantastic . The writing leaves little , if anything , to be desired . The pacing is spot-on . This is extremely exciting at its best , and even when not actively intense , there's nothing extraneous . The lighting is well-done . The cinematography is marvelous . The direction is fantastic . I recommend this to any fan of Kubrick , and / or the genres it falls into , and the others who helped make this .
450715	2093818	218505	8.0	Made-for-TV does not need to have negative connotations . . . just look at this movie	I haven't watched too many other efforts by Frankenheimer . . . unless I'm terribly mistaken , the only ones I have are his The Hire entry and Ronin . I keep finding myself impressed by him and seeking out what he's directed . The man did some mighty fine work ( R . I . P . ) . This may be my first exposure to Gambon , but I was definitely pleasantly surprised . He really brings Lyndon to life , and there isn't a moment where he's on-screen that the audience is bored . The parts are all filled well . . . Hall , Sinise , McGill , Baldwin and Sutherland , heck , everybody , deliver impeccable performances . The editing and cinematography are remarkably well-done . The music , as with much else in this , is underplayed very effectively . The pacing is just about flawless . Coming in at almost three hours , it's never dull and almost invariably concise . So much is said through so little . Yet it never becomes overpowering , either . The writing and its high quality are consistent . From what I can tell , this is rather true to what happened , and certainly realistic . Not actually a bio-piece on Johnson , but more a drama focused on his involvement in the Vietnam war , the debates about what action to take . There is some language and dialog of adult nature . I recommend this to those interested in the subject matter , and fans of the film-makers .
450234	2093818	86465	8.0	Unusually good 80's comedy . . . contains a lot of sad truth	I couldn't remember much of this movie when I borrowed it from a friend to watch for the second time . . . I can't have been very old when I first saw this , because there were not much more than one scene that I recognized . Even the title seemed new to me . Furthermore , I don't recall thinking about the film . . . about what it meant . This contains a lot of sad truth . The scenes of Aykroyd's character going from the peak of America's business life to rock bottom in a disturbingly short amount of time provide food for thought . Landis presents these events without pretense or heavy-handedness . . . he gives us the facts as they are . No bias . This direct , almost indifferent tone makes it all the more scary . . . this is the way it is , and that's accepted . The movie also has some insight to prove on racism and greed . Paul Gleason , whom I have only seen in The Breakfast Club ( and Not Another Teen Movie , spoofing his character in aforementioned movie ) plays a radically different role , yet still shows some of the authority he's famous for as the principal in The Breakfast Club . That was amusing to watch for someone who enjoyed said film so much . Jamie Lee Curtis bares a lot of skin , for those in the audience looking for that . Aykroyd and Murphy are both extraordinary . They get to play with their characters a lot , to great effect . They create so many funny moments , there are simply too many to list or for mere words to do justice ; you'll just have to watch the film for itself . If you are a fan of either actor , you won't be disappointed . The language surprised me , with how uncensored it was , compared to today's standards . The plot is interesting , and based on an intelligent idea . The pacing is dynamic . The acting is all top-notch . The humor is mostly good and tasteful , with few but glaringly obvious exceptions ( the fate of Beeks being an almost offensive one ) . The film has more heart than most of its kind . . . if you watch only one movie of this type , let this be it . I recommend this to fans of the actors and / or director , and people intrigued by the general idea . If you are even considering watching this . . . take my advice and do so . It is intelligent without being preachy and funny without trying too hard . John Landis has yet again created something big .
449764	2093818	495237	10.0	Beautiful . . . an amazing mix of old cinema with new , in a film about perception	Having been a big fan of Anders Matthesen for years , and having enjoyed his acting ( and hoping he'd do more than the sparse amount seen in his stand-up performances and the Christmas calendar he created ) , I was excited to see if he could pull off a lead . . . if he could carry a feature production . I'm very happy to say that he does so , and does it perfectly . The film plays out drawing strong emotion and manages to grab you by surprise on more than one occasion . The plot is well-written , and grabs you and doesn't let go until the credits roll . The acting is flawless in all cases . The pacing is deliberate and takes the time it needs to tell the story . . . no more , no less . You're never bored , and you're never overwhelmed . The direction is marvelously understated ( and at times contains an almost cynical deliberateness to the events . . . we can tell what's going to happen , but nothing can be done to prevent it ) , making for many thoroughly effective and strong moments in the film . The film inter-cuts with Pure Hearts , the old movie ( which was created for the film , and rather immensely well-done , one might add . . . they captured the essence and feel of such films perfectly ) that the two leads love watching , and does so to perfection . It adds a lot to the film , and is important to understand the main character and his motivation . The cinematography and editing is masterful . We aren't watching Kriss . . . we're experiencing the world as he sees it . As someone diagnosed with a weak form of Autism , I'm always curious as to how anyone with that syndrome is portrayed in films and the like . Often , we are subjected to attempts at an analysis by people who don't understand us . Occasionally , we are the butt end of the jokes . Here , it's done perfectly . All the details are spot-on , and the word " Autism " is never even mentioned . Anyone who knows about Autists watching this film will surely , as I , find the presentation to be accurate . I gained a lot of respect for Anders Matthesen tonight . . . and that says a lot , considering how much I already possessed . He does a perfect job of performing the role . His movements , his mannerism , his voice and vocabulary . . . astounding . Had one never seen this man act before , one would probably have sworn that he was Autistic . The writing is excellent . It takes you inside the mind of this man , and I dare anyone to watch this film through and not feel sorry for Kriss . . . in spite of his actions . One thing to note is that , apparently , the film is quite different from the book upon which it is based . The film is about good vs . evil . . . and perception . It provides good food for thought , and delivers its beautiful message perfectly . What that is , however , I shall not reveal here . . . I want each viewer to discover for himself . Also , I urge anyone who hasn't read the credits for the film here on IMDb to hold off on it until you've seen it . . . and if you already have , try your best to forget what you read . I glanced at it before I saw it , and luckily didn't remember any of what I read . This is an amazing film , and should be viewed by anyone old and mature enough to understand it , as well as hardened enough to take the tone and nature of some of the events . Kudos to Matthesen for not playing it for laughs ( though his famous eye-twitch makes an appearance or three ) and for displaying his talent in such a serious and demanding role . I recommend this to fans of Matthesen ( for his talent , not the laughs we're used to him providing ) and anyone intrigued by the subject matter .
450685	2093818	83907	10.0	A worthy contender for ' greatest horror film ever '	I don't know why it took so long for me to watch this film . . . I think it's the fact that I've always been told that it's a gore-fest and not really anything else . I can tell you now ; I have been grossly misinformed . This is one of those films that everyone who's into the genre should see . If you as much as ' like ' horror , you should see this film . Look past the less-than-stellar acting , the dubious dialog and the thin character writing , and you will see one of the greatest horror films ever created . The plot is hardly worth mentioning . The pacing is top-notch , you're not bored for a second through the entire film . Not one second , throughout the whole film . Seriously . The acting is mostly unimpressive . The characters are daftly written , and so hard to tell apart due to vague personalities that I was never completely certain how many men or women there were , or who was who ( well , apart from Campbell as Ash , but his face is a pretty recognizable one ) . The dialog , as mentioned earlier , is quite dubious . Just about all characters ( including the demons / Evil Dead , in-between moans and ' join us ' ) get at least one really bad line . Delivery isn't exactly perfect , either . The effects , though some cheap and a few outdated ( but not noticeably so ; none of them looked fake or were easy to figure out ) are very good . The real strength in this film , however , is the buildup to the horror and the editing . The way " The Evil " , this unseen , abstract force of true evil is hinted at through the film . . . impossibly effective . The POV shots originating from said force are incredibly creepy . The editing is tight and excellent . The cinematography is by far some of the best I have seen in my entire life . A few shots were off , but there is no doubt that Raimi knows exactly where to put the camera or how to move it , even when he doesn't have the money to get a hold of expensive rigs . Now , as mentioned earlier , many have told me that this is a gore-fest . . . while everything I have put in my review up to this point still stands , let me make one thing clear ; there is plenty of gore in this film . For better or for worse . Plenty . Limbs are torn off , bodies are maimed and blood is dripping by the truckloads . However , even if you don't like gore , if you don't care for blood and violence , you should watch this film . . . if you are into horror and you can take the gore ( which is graphic and intense , make no mistake about that ) , you should definitely watch this film . One to watch for everyone who is into horror . I recommend this film to every horror fan who believes he can stand the violence and gore , and to everyone who is into both horror and gore . . . you've probably already seen this film , but if you haven't , go do so now . You won't regret it .
450402	2093818	120586	10.0	Poignant piece on hate	This movie has left me speechless . Now , to fully grasp how gargantuan ( yes , I like Kill Bill ; sue me ) this effect is , you must understand how fond I am of talking . I can talk for hours . You may find yourself listening to me and wondering if and when I ever stop to breathe . Sidenote , that happens almost seamlessly while I talk , a common habit that comes with an affinity for rap music . . . but I digress . Getting back on topic ( if I still have your attention ; I imagine many readers gave up on this review the moment they realized that I have enjoyed the work of Tarantino and the music genre of hip-hop ) . . . this movie affected me strongly and deeply . The credits rolled nearly an hour ago , as I'm writing this , and the movie has not left my mind one single time since ( to be fair , neither has my fiancée . . . but she never leaves my mind ) . Such an amazing film . The plot is magnificent , and the way it's told is an example of incredibly talented storytelling . The acting is all top-notch , not one single performance was disappointing . The characters are well-written , credible and well-developed . The cinematography ( done by Tony Kaye , the director , himself , quite impressive ) is just a touch unusual , with what I would call some very tight close-ups , though I suspect the picture of my borrowed copy of this film to have been customized towards a different type of screen than my TV is , since there were times where the camera cut it a little close , removing parts of text visible on-screen and much of the characters ' heads in close-ups . The pace is excellent ; not once during watching was I bored or drawn towards any other activity than watching . There is time to take in what you see , but the movie never moves slowly . As my father commented after it was done , you find yourself nailed to your seat . Alternative methods of crucifixion aside . . . The editing is great , with a very fitting use of speed and perspective , and an interesting use of flashbacks . The direction is nothing short of masterful . The very ending of the film is such a perfectly set-up and astoundingly executed ' last word ' on hate and the effects of it . The underplayed direction that makes this scene have its impact . . . I must admit , Kaye has made a fan of me , and I will be sure to watch any other effort he releases , theatrically and otherwise . The score of this film is beautiful . I don't think it is possible to watch this film and not be emotionally involved . It's not that it's terribly manipulative ( all films are somewhat manipulative ; few forms of art aren't , and some movies are truly art . In fact , in my humble opinion , most movies should be ) , it's that it's true . Refreshingly free of an ideology , an agenda . It simply presents the truth . Hate begets hate . Violence spawns violence . Fighting fire with fire merely increases the burn . This movie truly got to me . Do yourself a favor ; let it get to you , too . Watch this if you get the chance to , and if you can take the harsh truth of it ( and , lest we forget , the rather aggressive and at times fairly graphic violence that it features ) . I urge you . This should be seen by anyone who can take it .
450452	2093818	32976	10.0	Fantastic Hitchcock , one of his best	This is Hitchcock at his best ; just when you think that you've figured everything out , you are treated to a twist that completely turns your perception of the film around . This isn't the twists of modern movies , where you're immediately awe-struck by the sheer unlikeliness of them , but rather twists that send a chill down your spine and turn the movie in a direction you wouldn't have imagined possible . There is almost more suspense and tension in the entire last half hour than there is in the collective amount of supposedly suspenseful films of newer time . This is thriller , as it's supposed to be . Don't give us the husband - suddenly - turned - psychotic out to kill his wife , keep the face-less killer devoid of any real motive away , and please spare us the old cliché of the psychopath who rarely ever has a reason for his / her behavior . This is what a thriller is supposed to be like . Constantly hinting at something , hidden in the past , keep us guessing what it is , and just when we think we've figured everything out , pull the carpet out from under our feet . The one complaint I could come up with for this film is that the first half doesn't accomplish much , apart from build-up and character development , but , the more I think about it , the more I realize that that's what makes the impact of the second half ; we think we know these people , these secretive and hidden people , we think we've figured out what they're hiding , why they are so secretive , and then we hear how different the truth is from what we had expected , and it is devastating , in a good way . To use a metaphor : Just the moment you're sure you've put together the puzzle , someone points out that you've missed a fourth of it , or , rather , points out that the picture is , while it seems logical at its current state , far from the real picture . The plot is excellent , and the way it slowly unravels is perfect . It keeps you guessing and watching , patiently and attentive , and once you're treated to the mind-blowing final half hour , full of twists , tension and suspense , you will not feel that you have wasted the time up to that point ; quite the opposite , actually . The film has a very good pace , and is thoroughly interesting . The acting is great ; Laurence Olivier as the mystical yet charming Maxim de Winter , Joan Fontaine as the nameless heroine who is humble and submissive , George Sanders as the sleazy , creepy Jack Favell and Judith Anderson as the cold character of Mrs . Danver , who is seemingly devoid of emotion . The characters are well-written and credible . The cinematography is defining of Hitchcock , with plenty of play on shadows and long , lingering pans that only increase the chill down your spine . The dialog is well-written and surprisingly sharp . The whole thing is just amazing as a film . Defining of Hitchcock and worth watching for any competent film viewer . One final note ; the last few scenes involve so many twists , so much suspense and tension , that it puts just about every single other non-Hitchcock thriller to shame . I recommend it to any major fan of film in general , as most should find something enjoyable about it , any fan of Hitchcock , and big fans of the following genres : thriller , mystery , drama and romance . This certainly deserves its place on the Top 250 ( as I'm writing this , it's # 105 ) , and should be viewed by any major fan of films in general .
450203	2093818	395169	10.0	A disturbing and unsettling piece of truth and cinema	Ten years after the atrocities and genocide in Rwanda , Africa , a movie is made about the man who helped lessen the loss . The man who gave everything he had in order to save complete strangers . Who put his life on the line for his fellow human beings . I couldn't possibly put to words how hard it was for me to hold back the tears for almost all of this movie ( which I had to , due to the crowd I saw it with ) . Some of these tears weren't ones of sadness . . . they were at the beauty inherent in this person . This humanitarian . With everything to lose and nothing to gain , he selflessly helped people who had nothing to offer him in return . This movie reminded me of Schindler's List . However , as one of the other viewers pointed out to me , it's far easier to distance yourself from that . . . with all possible respect to any and all victims of it , World War 2 ended over 60 years ago . What this movie depicts is just over a decade ago . Genocide . Which took place while us in the West sat far away , comfortable and not affected by it . . . and we did nothing . No UN , no US forces , nothing . This film is incredibly touching . I can't see anyone watching and not being emotionally involved . The plot is well-written and intriguing . The pace is perfect . It never moved too slow or too fast . It started adequately slow , but moved intensely later on . The acting is all spot-on . The writing is excellent . A great film that everyone should see . I recommend this to everyone who can sit through . Watch it if you get the chance and you're hardened enough to take it .
450275	2093818	408236	10.0	The cleanest shave you'll ever know	This is the third musical by Burton I've seen , and I've thoroughly enjoyed all three . This is the first live-action ( I shall leave you in suspense no longer : the other two are The Nightmare Before Christmas ( granted , he didn't direct it , but still ) and The Corpse Bride ( which may be the only other two musicals he's done ) of his I've seen , and it's by far the best ( but all three are of high quality , and very much worth watching ) . The themes are interesting and there is food for thought ( meanwhile , you may not want to eat close to your viewing of this , in fact , you probably shouldn't ) . The plot is well-written and well-told . I'm not usually up for musicals , and had Tim's name not been attached to this , I doubt I would have granted it a second glance . I cannot deny that this was spectacular . The trademarks , his style , are very much present : the Gothic visuals , the stylized and at times comical violence , the grotesque , the macabre , and so forth . There is little , if any , gore , but there are bucket-loads of blood . . . it is too red and doesn't come off as horrifying as that of other films ( this would appear to be entirely intentional ) . The pacing is marvelous . The acting is flawless , as is the singing . . . in both cases , the performances are quite simply excellent for every actor-singer . The characters are fleshed out expertly . The songs are well-written , and composed well . The cinematography and effects are magnificent , and the editing is as sharp and effective as one of Todd's razors . As the FAQ suggests , pay attention to the lyrics , not only will you miss out on delightful word-play , but important , perhaps crucial , details will also evade your attention if you do not . The humor is black , at times pitch black , and any potential viewer should consider if they can take all the contents . There's no actual sexuality , but some is implied . Language is not pervasive , and what little there is really isn't as strong as it easily could be . I recommend this to any fan of Tim Burton , Johnny Depp , and possibly of the play ( I haven't watched it , but hey , the composer of it not only was involved with this , he's since said that he likes the movie , a lot , even ) .
450483	2093818	369702	10.0	Amazing	This may very well be the best of Amenábar's work to date . I've seen all he's completed thus far , as of and including Tesis . I've yet to truly dislike or find myself unable to see genuine value in what I've watched that he's helmed . They are all movies of questions , not answers , as he , himself , puts it . And they all deal with life and death , often among other philosophical subjects . This perhaps in a different way than the others . At its center is the following for us all to ponder : Is living a right , or an obligation ? No lectures , no dictating , nothing is claimed as fact , but rather stated , and it is up to the individual to decide where they stand . The deliberate , eased pacing , with some use of sudden , startling shifts in intensity that he has employed before is evident here , and it's a perfect fit . This is very well-directed and effective . It can be strong , but never tasteless . In his make-up , Bardem is almost unrecognizable , going by what I've gotten of a look at him outside of it , which , admittedly , is not much . The editing and cinematography are masterful . Not a single moment is off . The acting , as well as I can judge it , not yet speaking the language , is spot-on , throughout . Javier , especially , seems to lose himself entirely in the role , and comes off as believable . The characters are well-written and credible . There is a little humor , and it is good ( do note that among it is relatively dark jokes ) . As with the previous releases by the man I mentioned at the beginning of this review , this is not a mainstream , easy-to-take-in flick . If you are seeking entertainment ( I'm not passing judgment , I don't only go for this kind of piece ) , you will probably do better to go elsewhere . The DVD holds three deleted scenes that are well worth the time ( and they're also subbed , so that helps ) , and a behind-the-scenes featurette that I will write about on its specific page here on the site . I recommend this warmly and eagerly to any fan of true film , of drama and of the people involved in making this , Alejandro in particular .
