482513	1293485	213149	1.0	It was just awful and I just couldn't get into it	I know that there are some " Pearl Harbor " fans , and I'm sorry but to be honest this movie is just trash . It seemed to me that the director just wanted to have a huge action movie and lost all the details that this event really happened . They just added a huge love story in it that wasn't memorable and also that they were trying to make another " Titanic " . I was looking forward to this movie when it came out , because I had studied World War II religiously and I couldn't believe this monstrosity of a film . Ben and Josh play Rafe and Danny , two American boys who grew up together and are in the army . Rafe seems to just be in love with America and one girl , Evelyn played by Kate , she's a nurse who helps Ben get back to health after a certain mishap with his nose . They have a romance , but when it comes time for Rafe to choose between his country and his love , which does he pick ? You just guess . But when an accident happens in England where Rafe is , they assume him dead and send Eve the message of his death . She and Danny then become real close through this lose and you guess it ! They get down and dirty ! Rafe comes back though expecting everything to be the same as before . Shock ! Eve is pregnant with Danny's baby ; but that's the least of their problems when the evil Japenese are thinking about bombing an unexpecting army base , Pearl Harbor . The movie then just turns into nothing but action and makes the audience forget that this was real . I didn't feel a connection between Ben and Josh . If could actors just look more like they hate each other or didn't enjoy working together . Kate has a good performance , but unfortunately is not supported well by the other actors . The Japenese are made out to be total villains , even though what they did was wrong , but the movie might as well just should made them into those villains from the old James Bond flicks . The movie just doesn't work and doesn't deserve respect in any way historically .
482288	1293485	118137	1.0	" When confronted by a werewolf , it is important that you immediately leave your car and run out in the open "	LOL , I just saw this movie from Mystery Science Theater 3000 , well , actually it was the first episode I ever saw . But I didn't remember the movie since that was back in like 1999 , but I just recently saw it again and I have to say that this movie was just an utter disaster waiting to happen . I feel awful for these siblings of Oscar winning actors , it seems like they get the crummy roles . So my sincere apologizes to Joe Estevez , it's bad enough your brother gets awesome roles , then your nephews as well ? Poor Joe , let's take a moment for him while I try my best to describe this movie . OK , from what I gathered , a group of archaeologists dig up werewolf remains . Now a group of scientists take the remains , but not before one of the archaeologists gets a cut from the remains , and becomes a werewolf ? So this guy , I think his name is Paul , starts to infect people wanting them to become werewolves while his hair style changes on a minutely basis . Then this girl , Natalie , would like to save him . . . and she ends up with a bad consequence with no explanation what so ever . This movie is just plain bad , believe me . I am so sorry that I had to see this film , but it was awesome watching it with Mystery Science Theater 3000 , that's the only way that makes this film tolerable . I loved the scene with the couple's just making out and the girl gets out of the car while she sees a werewolf and runs out in the open , while her boyfriend just stays in the car . LOL , great MSTK3 episode , bad movie .
483094	1293485	408839	1.0	This was possibly the most uncomfortable movie I have ever seen	And that's incredibly sad after seeing Pink Flamingo's last year , I mean The Heartbreak Kid was just one of the most stupid films I have seen . There was absolutely nothing funny about this movie and I don't understand it's rating . The Farally brothers have lost their gift , because I have no idea what they were smoking when they came up with this film and thought it would be a good idea . Ben Stiller also , I mean , his character was absolutely the biggest jerk I have ever seen on film and was in no way likable . I think that was the main problem I was having with this movie was due to the fact that I think Ben Stiller's character was supposed to be likable , but there was no saving him from the way this script was written , because he is in no way justifiable . The Heartbreak Kid was definitely the worst film of 2007 . Eddie is starting to feel a bit alone in the world filled with love sick couples . But that all changes when he meets a beautiful girl , Lila , and after 6 weeks of dating her , she needs to go to a different country for a job , but Eddie is feeling so good that with the pressure from his dad and friend , he marries her . They go on their honeymoon and Eddie finds out that Lila have some disturbing traits to her personality . But his vacation quickly changes when he meets Miranda who is on a family reunion , and he falls in love with her . But of course , since he's still " technically " married , it gets hard to tell Miranda . The Heartbreak Kid has some of the most uncomfortable nudity I've ever seen . I have no problem with nudity in films depending on the context , but this script was so awful , like how Lila loved being a freak in bed . OK , I get it after the first scene , but they continue this weird joke for a few more scenes , not to mention her jellyfish scene with Ben was beyond gross . This was just an unnecessary film in every aspect , the script needs at least some major work because the characters are awful and so is the story . Please stay away from this junk , it's not worth your time .
482518	1293485	416315	1.0	What the heck is wrong with you people ?	To those who enjoyed the film , I have one question : Why ? This film was stupid and a complete waste of time . I'm not one who was looking for a gory film , so don't say to me that I didn't get the " art " of the film because all in all , this was a poorly made film and believe it or not as horrible as it may sound I was rooting for the killer to win because those girls were so incredibly stupid . SCENE SPOILERS The girl surprises the killer by having his riffle , she misses the shot and hits his neck , good injury , but not great . Now if she didn't want to kill him , that's fine , but injure him . . . bad ! Now there are no more bullets for her to kill him , but he has a knife , she doesn't take his knife and stabs him . OK , that I could see , maybe she forgot or something , but now she could have taken the butt of the riffle and hit him in the head causing a bad concussion or even death . But no , she just hits him in the back that would probably more likely wake him up or give him a tiny back ache . Stupid women ! I'm a girl and I was embarrassed to be one because of this movie . This movie is so stupid , don't waste your time or money . To people who liked this film , I'm not judging but seriously , what did you see in this movie ?
483160	1293485	155975	1.0	" If you don't jell , it's not Jello , and this just ain't jelling "	I know curiosity killed the cat , but I simply had to see the remake of Psycho , especially after being on such a Hitchcok journey recently and knowing his work . I've watched the original Psycho though since I was a kid , I knew how to respect it and not only that , it was an excellent movie ! One of the best , in fact ! The first thing I said when I heard about the remake was " How do you remake perfection ? " . I stuck to that as well , but I think I have a more open mind now and figured maybe it was a way of introducing Psycho to a new generation . But this turned into a total insult and slap to the face of the original Psycho . I know this has been said , but I watched the making of this film , and the director was like " Oh , I just want to update it and shoot each scene shot by shot like the original " . . . what's the friggin ' point ? ! OK , but I want to judge this movie on it's own , despite it's insulting blows the original . I mean , the acting wasn't up to par , but honestly , it looked like the actors just watched the original and just memorized the lines from there and made it their crappy own . Watching the making of this film , I wanted to slap Anne Hasche , she said " I've never seen the original , I just wanted to work with Gus . " Ooh , that made me angry , because frankly , it's not just that , she really sucked in this role as Marian , she wasn't convincing , not to mention her shower scene really was horrible . Vince Vaughn didn't make . . . let's just put it this way , the film was horribly miscasted . This was a sin against film and on it's own , this was actually a bad movie . It was too much and destroyed what could've been a new introduction for a new generation . But to Gus , leave the film making the one's who KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING !
482468	1293485	443649	1.0	I never realized how good the dental insurance was back then for cave men	OK , after hearing many horrible reviews for 10 , 000 BC , I have to say that I was really put off , this I was assuming was supposed to be the big kick off to the huge block busters . But I got to see it for free , and I always think that sometimes people just misjudge a film , even though my co-worker warned me , I still went for it and saw it . Thank God the movie ended when it did , I had the neuce around my neck by the end of this film . I mean , seriously , did the " writer " do any history homework ? ! First off , let's talk about appearances , the " cave men " have perfect teeth , have evolved well for what's supposed to be over 10 , 000 years ago , and remove the dirt , they're skin belongs in a Neutragina ad . Script ? Was there one ? I have no idea , the story made absolutely no sense and the ending was horrible . I don't want to give away what happens , but trust me , I think you'll be as confused as I was . I'm going to try my best to explain the plot to you , it's high school drama with cave men , so bare with me . De'Leh is a cave man with his tribe and has earned the title of " best warrior " , he is allowed to have any woman , so he picks his childhood sweet heart , Evolet , but he later feels as if he didn't earn that right , so he " gives her up " . She is kidnapped by another gang , oh , no ! Whatever will he do ? He gave her up , but he still digs her and never even got a kiss ! So he goes after her with a few of his friends and find themselves fighting saber-tooth's , monstrous snow storms , a snake river , and even a god who got a bad nail job . Oh , let's hope he can save his girlfriend in time and all will be well . That's the Cliff's Notes version I can come up with . May I just say that I absolutely loved how the cave men spoke perfect English , seriously , I didn't realize that it was possible for them to speak that well in American English . This script was written for 12 year old's , seriously . Then they put in these awkward jokes , strange characters that are more laughable than serious , and a love story that would seriously be so non-existent if this was an accurate portrayal of history . I don't mind when they " bend " the truth for dramatic purposes , but this was the friggin ' Seasamse Street version of cave men history . Stay away from this trash , it's just a waste of time , sadly , how many good movies could have been made with the budget they probably put onto this film ? I'm seeing at least 7 already .
483317	1293485	426615	1.0	Very possibly the worst movie I have ever seen	And that's pretty sad , because I've seen a bunch of horrible movies , but this one is in a class of it's own . Now , I'm going to be honest , I wanted to see this film when it was first released in the theaters . It looked kinda like a fun movie , but I decided to wait until it was for rent . I knew this movie had a bad rating on IMDb , but I figured it was just because Usher was one of the biggest stars at the time and people were just trying to trash him . Boy , I apologize for doubting the views of the IMDb users . First off , what was the screenwriter on when he wrote this ? Or was he simply reading " Screenwriting for dummies " ? What the hell does he or the director take me for ? ! I grew up in friggin ' little Italy / Chicago ! I'm not stupid . Now , not to sound horrible , but this movie was totally inaccurate on how a mafia boss would let an African American watch his daughter . Never would happen in a million years . Not to mention the horrible stereo types in this film ! It was horrible . The two lovers had no chemistry and the plot was . . . . ahh ! Just never see this movie ever ever ever !
482475	1293485	120591	2.0	One of the lamest disaster movies ever made	If I have to deal with any more of Ben Affleck's tears , I am going to scream . Why does he have to cry in all of his roles ? It's irritating . " Armagedden " promises a lot , but doesn't deliver it's title . Usually , you'd expect this huge and great movie . The special effects are the only thing that could get you into the movie . The acting was below average and the story is pretty bad . Bruce Willis was always great with his roles , but even he couldn't save this movie . The ending was beyond cheesey . I think this was one of those movies where you actually voted for the asteroids to win . Please , if you love disaster films , don't see " Armagedden " . It's a waste of time .
482023	1293485	160611	3.0	Didn't really get it , nore do I think I wanted to get it	Kevin Spacey is my favorite actor of all time , he is without a doubt on other's lists as well when it comes to great actors . He even pulled off a good Irish accent in Ordinary Decent Criminal as well . But Kevin Spacey , as a Mafia leader ? Or even a burglar ? I'm not so sure he could go that far . The movie to me just didn't make any sense and the some of the story just didn't feel solved to me . I know once again that IMDb is going to make me write ten more lines . But I'm not so sure on what I could say about this movie because I am still trying to figure it out . Silly , isn't it ? But I'm pretty sure that more than a few of you IMDb users have been in the same predicament as I am in right now where you just want to say a line or two about a movie , but now you have to do ten lines ? Wow , that should do it . :
482494	1293485	155776	3.0	I'd rather swallow a jawbreaker whole	I know a lot of people are saying " Then why did you watch the movie ? " I was watching my cousins and they wanted to rent this movie very badly . I figured , it's a typical teen flick , so why not ? This movie is meant for no one . I mean , it's OK to watch , but it's definitely not worthy of any sort of awards or praise . It's a dark teen " comedy " , that's for sure . The thing about the movie that got me ticked off was how unrealistic it was . I mean , there was no justice , period ! The acting was terrible and the plot was very unoriginal . I wouldn't really recommend this movie , unless you're into that " Dawson's Creek " B . S .
482848	1293485	1139668	3.0	Jumby wants to be in a better movie	Well at least the trailer was scary , from the moment I saw the trailer for The Unborn I knew I wanted to see this movie , it looked so freaky and like the ultimate scare . So before it left theaters , I finally saw it and I should've realized , it's PG-13 , how rare is it that we get a PG-13 horror movie that is actually scary ? Sadly all the " intense " moments were shown in the trailer and I was extremely disappointed with this lousy movie . I couldn't believe how bad it was , it once again has every cliché in a horror film that you can imagine : the black best friend , the loving boyfriend , the hot skinny girl who is constantly in her underwear , the jumps , the mirrors , the nightmares , the over acting . I do have one question : did Gary Oldman owe someone a favor when he took this film ? It's just mind-boggling , he's this terrific actor and he was in this really predictable stupid story ? Well , hopefully he'll recover soon from this sad excuse for a horror film . Casey Beldon is plagued by merciless dreams , visions of strange looking dogs , and an evil child with bright blue eyes . Casey is baby-sitting Matty , her neighbor's son . He is upstairs , supposedly taking a nap . Casey is downstairs talking on the phone to her best friend Romey . Suddenly , there is a voice that says " Jumby wants to be born now , " on the baby monitor used for Matty's baby sister . After yelling , " Matty , are you awake ? " Casey goes upstairs to check on them . Matty was standing over the baby's crib , holding a mirror to the baby's face . After being hit with the mirror , Casey's eyes begin to change color and she learns she had a twin brother who died in the womb . Casey begins to suspect that the spirit haunting her is the soul of her dead twin , being possessed by a dybbuk , wanting to be born so it can transfer to the world of the living . Casey meets a woman named Sofi , who is revealed to be her grandmother . Sofi explains that she had a twin brother who was killed in Nazi experiments in Auschwitz when they were both just children . The boy was brought back to life by a dybbuk who intended to use his body as a portal into the world of the living . Sofi killed her twin to stop the dybbuk , and now it haunts her family for revenge . Sofi refers Casey to Rabbi Sendak , who can perform a Jewish exorcism to remove the dybbuk . This was a huge disappointment , I wouldn't really recommend it . The acting and writing were over done , what could have made this more realistic or scary is just a touch up on the writing . The lead actress Odette Yustman really needs experience , she was just alright in the film . Of course I love the cliché of the crazy black best friend who calls her crazy at first but then all of a sudden is attacked at last second . If you do watch this , if you want a good scare , turn on the lights , I admit there are still some freaky moments , better than most of the PG-13 horror movies , but the story was just bad . It just could have been a lot better .
483589	1293485	65112	4.0	I knew Alfred wasn't perfect !	Every director has at least one bad movie or at least not as exciting as his other films . I was very much looking forward to Topaz , I saw a trailer for it and it looked like high suspense and ground breaking effects . Boy , was I wrong . I hate to admit it , I fast forwarded most of the movie because I nearly fell asleep more than a few times . This was a very dull and slow moving flick that I would really not recommend . Especially to those fragile viewers , because this could tarnish your view on Hitchcock forever . Not his best , probably his worst , I would really recommend to skip Topaz .
482433	1293485	144814	4.0	There's a good movie somewhere in here	OK , I am a big fan of horror movies as you can see if you look at my comments . So , when I heard that there would be a sequel to Carrie , I was a little confused . But I dealt . So , this was playing on HBO . I decided to give it a chance . Now the movie starts pretty strong . With a good plot coming in to play . But it turns too much into a teen movie . And then it becomes a little too predictable . I didn't mind it so much . But I was disappointed . I didn't get the whole relation to Carrie . They mentioned something about that . I'm not sure what it is though . It was pretty stupid . I must have blocked it out .
483607	1293485	95889	4.0	Well , they're baaack agaaaain	Poltergeist 3 was one of those mistake sequels that was an unnecessary movie to make in the first place . The second one ended the story just right and made us feel comfortable with it . The third Poltergeist might have worked , but the only characters that came back was Carol Anne and Tabith , I think her name was , you know that lady with the annoying voice ? Well , it just didn't work as well without the other cast , not to mention they felt like a shove off with this plot . Carol Anne is sent off to live with her aunt and uncle in Chicago temporally , she is going to a special school to help her out with all her trauma from home . But the ghost have followed her again to wreak havoc on her and her new family . Only this time , there are more " jumpy " scenes to freak the audience out . It isn't a terrible sequel , it just wasn't necessary and it was sad to look at that little girl's face knowing she died during the filming of this movie . Such a short life , but at least she'll always be remembered and a great treasure for horror fans . But I would only recommend this sequel for those who wish to complete the sequel . Like I said , it isn't bad , it just wasn't fair to the original movies and it was sad to see Carol Anne in her last days , but I guess you'll just have to judge for yourself .
482134	1293485	324554	4.0	Explained too late	I couldn't get past all the confusion at the beginning . I was just wondering what the heck was going on ? And where was this movie going ? It wasn't too bad . After all , I did like " Vanilla Sky " . But you spend most of the movie just frustrated . SPOILER ! ! ! ! Josh Hartnett is Matthew . A guy from Chicago with a future and a life ahead of him . He has a wonderful fiancée . She does absolutely nothing wrong . He lies to her about his business trip to China . He instead stays in Chicago to see an old flame . And as it turns out his old flame's best friend is keeping them apart . The best friend is Alex . She is also in love with Matthew . But Matthew's best friend is in love with her . It gets more confusing . I did get it . But I'm not going to see it again .
483354	1293485	300471	4.0	It's funny because they make funny references to the future	In case you didn't know , I was being sarcastic ! Man , this was a pretty bad sequel to " Shanghai Noon " . I mean , it wasn't the acting or plot , I think it was the script . Also the character development ? What character development ? Owen Wilson just seemed so out of place in this film . You might as well have called it " Shanghai Jackie " . I admit , Jackie has become a big star and deserves it , but now I think his ego is getting out of control . You can tell in the movie how much he is showing off his moves . We get it , Jackie can do karate well . It was cool in the past , but now , he's just getting old with it . I'm sure many are agreeing with me too . 6 . 3 ? Please ? I really didn't get into it .
482202	1293485	86393	4.0	Superman vs . Richard Pryor . . . who will win the power of the silver screen ?	I just watched Superman III and was excited to see Richard Pryor on the cover , but then I even thought as I was paying for the rental " wait , why am I excited to see Richard Pryor more than Christopher Reeve ? " , it was an interesting thought . But I was thinking maybe it's just because I was just more used to being excited about some kind of comedy , but the problem was that it seemed like the comedy took over what could've been a great super hero story . Superman / Clark Kent is now invited to his high school reunion where he sees his old high school crush and they hit it off . Gus , played by Pryor , is a computer worker , he is asked by a big boss to play with the computers and control the weather and more ! But when Superman interferes with that , they decide to throw some kryptonite at him , but it fails , but turns Superman into a bad guy ! Hence the alternate title of " Superman vs . Superman " . Like I said , it just didn't seem to balance right with these two huge movie stars . In the 70's and 80's , Richard Pryor could do no wrong , he was so popular , and I think that overshadowed Christopher's presence on the screen . The comedy and drama didn't mesch well , I just think that this could've been a great sequel , but just didn't excel to what it could'v been .
482527	1293485	424993	4.0	Honestly ? It has it's moments here and there , but it's one of those films that are so stupid that it's funny	I had absolutely no interest what so ever in seeing Employee of the Month , let's face it , Jessica Simpson does not equal movie of the year . But my friends and I were stuck inside yesterday and my friend's brother rented Employee of the Month and said that it was pretty funny , so we decided to watch it . While I admit there were a few funny moments , it's the same pointless humor that you see in an average comedy . Jessica , well , even though she wasn't horrible , she wasn't that much of an addition to the cast , her part was just smiles and giggles , so it wasn't that much of a part . Basically , Guy is an employee at a " Sam's Club " sort of speak , only he doesn't take his work very seriously , Vince is the only employee who goes above and beyond his work making employee of the month for 17 months in a row and is about to win a car if he wins employee of the month once again . But all that changes when a new girl , Amy , starts working with them and now Guy and Vince are competing for employee of the month since they heard about Amy only liking the best workers . But Guy is about to . . . you guessed it . . . loose touch with who he really is and same with loosing his friends . While it's a pretty stupid movie , I have to admit that I had a few laughs here and there , it's silly humor , but it's all good . But I'm very serious and not just saying this , Jessica really needs to stay away from film because she doesn't add much to the screen besides incredibly low cut tops for the teenage boys . But this is one of those movies you have to decide for yourself , because if I actually had a few laughs , I'm not sure if my brain is functioning correctly .
482071	1293485	1059786	4.0	I thought it was kind of stupid . . . sorry ?	Eagle Eye's trailer was one of the coolest trailers that I had seen in a little while , so I was looking forward to seeing it . I work at a movie theater and a lot of people were walking out very happy , so I had high hopes , so I saw it a couple of weeks ago , I don't know , it's very strange because it seems like after I saw it and didn't like it , the audience didn't like it either . The rating however here on IMDb continued to rise , so I wanted to think this movie over , but seriously , I'm still not crazy over Eagle Eye . My problem with it is that it's dumb , it's just a silly story line , there's a good unrealistic and there's a bad unrealistic , this is a bad unrealistic . Not to mention that I thought it was unoriginal with the " technology will destroy us all " story line , if you are going to use this story line once again , I suggest making it worth my time . Jerry Shaw is a young man who is kind of a bum , he really needs to get his life together , just needs a little determination . Well he might get that when he receives a phone call from a mysterious lady who is telling him to get out of his weapon stuffed apartment and that the FBI are about to bust in , he fails and is arrested . Later we meet a young woman who is also a mother , Rachel , and the same lady calls her threatening her son if she doesn't follow the rules . Jerry escapes and finds Rachel , together they are ordered around town to get a bomb for this voice that can alter any cell phone , computer , even signs on the sides of the building , or there will be horrible consequences . Agent Morgan is chasing after these two having to realize maybe there's more to this than just Jerry and Rachel running from the law . Eagle Eye does truly deliver on the action , as much as I hate to say it , this car chase scene in the movie is very exciting and should be watched on the big screen . There are some other very tense and fun moments , but great action doesn't make a great movie . I also felt like Michelle Monaghan is miscast , somehow this woman who looks like she could be no older than 25 years old is playing a mom , it was just odd to take her as this character . Then they place a strange love story between her and Shia and it just throws the movie off completely . I would say if you're going to spend money on it , do a matinée , otherwise , I'd say skip it , to me at least this was just an over blown movie that could have been toned down just a smidge .
482742	1293485	151683	5.0	Your basic pre-teen movie	I have to admit , I was 12 when this came out . I was in love with it . I was the age they were aimed at . I saw this on the Disney channel last night . I thought I would still love it . I have recently discovered that tastes change . And sometimes for the better . Although , I still think it was a cute little comedy . 12 year olds will definitely enjoy it . I wouldn't doubt that . The acting and the story are just a little lame . And of course there always is a message to be learned . Afer all , this was on the Disney channel . But it's better then most of the trash 12 year olds watch today . So , I would suggest it for them .
482728	1293485	897361	5.0	Very strange , but not terrible	My friend and I were looking for a movie to see in the theater yesterday , everything I saw she didn't ad everything she saw I didn't , but one movie we didn't see was I Know Who Killed Me . We never heard of it , we actually for a minute didn't wanna see it because Lindsay Lohan was in it , but eventually we were just like " What the heck ? " . We needed a couple hours to kill and had free movie tickets that we got as a gift . So after seeing I Know Who Killed Me , I just was thinking of how much of a strange movie this was , but at the same time I didn't think it was all that bad , there were some things left unexplained and the ending was pretty lame , but I think over all , this was a thriller with good potential and just needed a little pick-me-up . Aubrey is a good girl who has strong potential to be a good writer and piano player , she has a good life , good home , loving parents , good friends , and a loving boyfriend . One night though , she is kidnapped and brutally tortured . Someone finds her on the road , but when Aubrey is picked up and taken to the hospital , she says she's not Aubrey , she's Dakota Moss , a stripper with a dirty life who has no idea what's going on , but she's not Aubrey . Is this a story that she's believing too much ? Is this a possible side effect from being traumatized ? Is this something from the drugs the killer was making her take ? Or is she even right ? Is it a possibility that she really isn't Aubrey ? Everyone calls her crazy and just tries to make her believe that she is Aubrey , but Dakota searches for the truth and wants answers . Like I said , I Know Who Killed Me turned out to be a little surprise of a film , I liked it personally , there were things that were confusing , but over all I think the plot kept me guessing and going . Lindsay I would say did a good job , but the strip scenes at times were a little too much , just because we all know her personal life , so I think it would make us a little uncomfortable . There are some flaws to the film , but I wouldn't say to stay away , just keep your mind open and you might find yourself liking it .
482444	1293485	252866	5.0	Not a big fan of it , but it was better than the first	I have only met one person who didn't like this film . So , I decided to give it a shot , even though I disliked the first " American Pie " . I have to admit , I had a couple laughs . But there were still a lot of jokes that were too close to the first one . The plot was also the same . I don't mind that too much . But if you didn't enjoy the first one , you won't get a big kick out of this one . I did enjoy some of the jokes . And the story was a point above the first one . So , if you loved the 1st , be my guest . If you didn't enjoy the 1st one , still give the 2nd a shot . You don't know what you may get . Some may actually just enjoy the 2nd one alone . Who knows ? Maybe I'll even watch " American Wedding " .
482725	1293485	252076	5.0	I liked it	I rented Maid in Manhattan the other day and watched it last night , but before I had watched it , I looked at the rating on IMDb and I saw the low rating and I was like " Oh , no , I've picked another bad movie " . I don't know why I wanted to see this movie , just I figured I needed a romantic comedy in my selection , so I just grabbed it and even after that rating I thought this was going to be a bad movie . But as it turns out this really wasn't a bad movie at all . Yeah , it has minor flaws here and there , this isn't movie of the year , but over all I would say that it was pretty cute . Marisa is a single mom in Manhattan who is a working maid in one of the top hotels . She is also up for a big promotion as a manager and is hoping to help her fellow employees . When she and a co-worker are just fooling around and wondering what it's like to try on over 5 , 000 dollars worth of clothes , Marisa gets caught by a politician who her son is excited to meet . She has to convince him that nothing can happen between them without letting him know what she did and who she really is , but it might be too strong of a connection for both of them to let go so easily . Maid in Manhattan is predictable and I think Marisa's character wasn't really as developed as I would like her to be because she came off as kinda rude and judgmental . But over all , I wouldn't say this is a 4 . 5 rated movie , I think people were probably just jumping on the movie because it is Jennifer Lopez , I would agree , I'm not into her either , but I can't resist if I do like a movie or not and I wanna be honest if I like a movie . So please just give the movie a shot if you're looking for a sweet romantic comedy .
483191	1293485	160127	5.0	Oh , those silly angels , if only they weren't so exploited	I remember in 2000 , I was a sophomore in high school , so naturally , you'd think this movie would've been perfect for me . But I got so annoyed with how advertised it was and how Cameron , Drew , and Lucy just wouldn't stop holding hands ! It was just so annoying and Charlie's Angels proved to be that this was the director's wet dream when he was a pre-teen looking up at those famous Farah Faucett posters . Charlie's Angels was a fun TV series in the 70's about three very attractive ladies : Alex , Dylon , and Natalie who fought crime and just had so much fun with their sex appeal . It was a fun time and wasn't too exploited , well , if you watch this movie , forget all that . I decided to wait until I was ready to watch this movie without being so judgemental , well , it reached my expectations when I was 15 ! Basically , the girls are just trying to save Charlie's life from a villain who thinks Charlie killed his dad . This film made me wonder , the 70's action sequences worked so well , so why did we need all the CGI effects in this film ? Not to mention , Cameron Diaz could break easily , this was so not believable . Cameron , Lucy , and Drew , these girls just didn't seem like the perfect angels . But maybe that's just me . Charlie's Angels wasn't as bad as I expected , but still , that's not saying much , it just couldn't stay on the right direction and was too exploited . I wouldn't mind taking a peek at the sequel , I'm hoping maybe they might do something right , but if the rating on IMDb is right , maybe I should think first .
482416	1293485	278435	5.0	I'd have to say " Enough already "	I normally enjoy these type of plots for some reason . It's a guilty pleasure of mine I must admit . I do like the whole " boyfriend / girlfriend goes crazy on girlfriend / boyfriend " type of stories . But this was a little stupid than what I usually expect . See , the normal thing to do when a spouse is abusive and you fear for your child's life is to call the police . Not run away from your problems . If you knew that your husband was a psychopath and a stalker , would you just run ? Jennifer Lopez's acting isn't bad in the film . I've never really thought she was a great actress to begin with . She is pretty convincing in the film though . The movie isn't bad , but the plot was just unrealistic .
482373	1293485	1127884	5.0	LOL , I just couldn't resist	My generation , we had the Spice Girls , you know how they were so hated , they were too perky , too fake , too sexy , too advertised , had everything they wanted , the list goes on and on , but 12 year old girls ( like I was at the time ) absolutely adored them . We also had a movie called Spice World which again got a ton of hate , while the movie was terrible , it was the new generations " Gimme Shelter " or even " Yellow Submarine " , now most would argue with me because the music was better back in the day , hey , guess what ? Their parents thought the same thing , now we have Hannah Montana / Miley Cyrus : Best of Both Worlds Concert Tour , the whole point of my ramble is , this is the new Spice World , little girls look up to Hannah Montana , as silly as it is , we have all been through the same thing generation after generation . We always get into the same argument , notice a pattern here ? It's rather scary when you think it over . Hannah Montana / Miley Cyrus : Best of Both Worlds Concert Tour takes you back stage with Miley Cyrus , her big preparation for her big concert . She talks with family and friends , talks a little bit about her character / alter ego Hannah Montana and what a journey it's been . We find out from her screaming fans why she is so wonderful , what people would go through to get those tickets for her concert . There is also a special performance from The Jonas Brothers , Miley goes on as Hannah and then later on performs as herself . Hannah Montana / Miley Cyrus : Best of Both Worlds Concert Tour honestly is good for the 12 year old's , in my opinion , the concert was pretty cool to watch . I watched this with my 10 year old cousin and I just saw how her eyes lite up as she sang to the songs , so you know what ? I think this was nice for the little one's , it's a Disney Movie , it's Hannah Montana , so I really don't know what people were expecting . It's also very short , so I wasn't tortured with it or anything , like I said , we go through this every generation , Hannah Montana / Miley Cyrus : Best of Both Worlds Concert Tour is just the new concert / artist biography for the little girls who need an idol to look up too .
482091	1293485	79574	5.0	What the heck ? ! Was Roger Moore a huge fan of Star Wars ?	As much as I am happy that I finally got to the introduction of Jaws , I have to admit , I wasn't really into this James Bond flick , it just wasn't as original as the other Bond flicks I have seen so far . James Bond meets outer space and discovers the evil master plan as usual , that Hugo Drax plans to destroy global warming , dun dun dun ! Although , I have to admit that Jaws falling in love was just too sweet , it's like freaks have feelings too , you know ? : D , just kidding ! I love Jaws ! He's so cool . Over all , this was an OK Bond flick , not my favorite so far , it was just too much of a copy off of Star Wars . But like I said , I'm just too into Jaws , so I have to give points for such a cool villain !
482866	1293485	388419	5.0	Yeah , it's stupid , but cut it some slack	It seems like on IMDb , a lot of people bash the newer Christmas movies , which in some ways I can understand , because most of the older movies could never ever be touched like A Christmas Story or It's A Wonderful Life , but I think we do need to be more open to these new family Christmas movies . I borrowed this movie from my friend and both her and I agree that it really wasn't all that bad . Although that it reminded me of another very bad 7th Heaven episode , I have to admit that I laughed a couple times , you have to just let up about these types of movies . The Krank's daughter , Blaire , has just gone away for the Peace Corps . and she will be away for a year , figuring it might be a good chance to think of only themselves , the parents decide to skip Christmas . But the Christmas loving neighborhood won't hear of it , they have their hearts set on getting the Kranks to love Christmas again and get all the decorations out along with the annual Chrismas Eve party they through . But they won't hear of it . . . until Blaire unexpectedly decides to come home for Christmas with a big surprise ! Over all , I wouldn't say that this was a fantastic Christmas movie , but it wasn't a bad one at all . It had flaws , a lot of movies do , but we need to cut it a break . You have got to admit the botox scene with Tim was pretty funny , even if it was a little over the top . So , honestly , just let go and have fun , you can't take this type of movie seriously , otherwise , what's the point of watching it if you just expect bad ?
482147	1293485	141109	6.0	It was lame and cheesy , but I think people are way to harsh on this film	I watched " Jack Frost " last night and I had my doubts because of all the bad reviews on IMDb . But I didn't think it was that bad . Yeah , it is a little cheesy , and of course very unrealistic . Sometimes that's what you need for a feel good kind of a movie . Over all , the script and acting is a little silly and this a movie more for the family by yourself . But I wouldn't mind seeing this again . It's not really that terrible . I'm serious , just give the movie a shot . Like I said , people are a little too harsh on the film when they just can't admit it makes them feel good afterwards . So , give the movie a shot . Especially around the holidays if you feel like a scrooge .
483044	1293485	455499	6.0	Cute and fun	I recently saw Garfield the movie and decided to go ahead and see what the sequel Garfield : A Tail of Two Kitties was about . These movies are so short , what do I have to loose , right ? Well I watched Garfield 2 yesterday and actually it was a pretty cute movie , from what I was expecting , I thought this was just a fun family film . Again , we do deal with the CGI , but for what this movie was , it had a cute story and fun characters . I'm kinda wondering though , what was the purpose of this sequel ? It's one of those " was this for the money or for the kids " movies . But I have to admit that this still had some fun laughs and cute moments , I'm such a sucker for the dogs , like Odie . But this movie felt more like a straight to DVD release than an actually theater movie . Jon wants to propose to his girlfriend , Liz , Garfield is so not in the mood to loose Jon to another life just when he got used to Odie . But Liz has to go to London for a convention , Jon thinks it would be the perfect idea to go and surprise her over there and propose . Garfield and Odie sneak with Jon and take the vacation too . But when a cat , Prince , who looks exactly like Garfield , is thrown away into the streets by Dargis , who wants Prince's castle that he inherited , Garfield is mistaken for Prince and taken back to the castle to live the high life and just party . Prince is mistaken for Garfield and lives the lower but the funnest life of lasagna and laziness . Garfield : A Tail of Two Kitties isn't a bad movie by any means , I think this is the perfect family film where it's great for the kids and even the adults will get a few laughs . I mentioned before in my Garfield comment that these movies did defeat the whole purpose of the original cartoon , but I guess I'll have to give up because you know we will see these movies again where they'll take our favorite childhood cartoon and turn it into CGI madness , maybe Woody Woodpecker will be next , who knows ? But anyways , Garfield : A Tail of Two Kitties is decent enough for the watch , but one watch is enough I'd say .
483653	1293485	408790	6.0	An above average thriller	Imagine , your child is lost on a plan that no one has seen , and now you hear that your child died back home and you're just possibly crazy . Have you really lost your child or are you simply mad ? OK , I know that's silly to say , but that is Flightplan in a nut shell . It's a good action thriller movie that is pretty well paced and is somewhat inspiring to never give up when you know your senses . But this movie did have it's flaws and overdoing's on explosions . It also had it's stereotypes and were just a little bit too much when it was not needed . I mean , over all , I would recommend Flightplan for a watch , but only if you enjoy these types of thrillers . It's a decent flick that keeps you guessing after all .
482029	1293485	113627	6.0	What Hollywood taught us about sex	What could have been a good movie , it just slid down after the last hour . I borrowed this movie from a friend and my best friend and I watched it together a couple nights ago . My friend kept saying that it was a very romantic and excellent movie . And Nicolas Cage with Elizabeth Shue ? This has to be a good movie , right ? This is one of the biggest downer movies I have ever seen . My best friend even walked out and wanted to stop watching it after the rape scene . I wanted to wait until the very end , hoping there was going to be in some cheesy way of " And they lived happily ever after " . But no , it just got more and more depressing to watch . The movie is good and the story is interesting , but it's a movie I probably won't watch again , just because it is very disturbing . The title I put , I've learned something from a TV show on E ! , you play a hooker in Hollywood , it's Oscar time ! LOL .
483447	1293485	397065	6.0	Despite typical remake styles and Paris Hilton's acting , this wasn't too shabby . . . and there is an ultimate plus to this film	Now , I have not seen the original " House of Wax " in a long time , which is o . k . I never had much interest . Seeing Paris Hilton in the cast made me stay away from the title , but my friend rented this and asked if I would join . I had nothing better to do , so I figured why not ? Over all , actually this wasn't too bad . I mean , it seemed like a typical teen slasher film : sex . , smart , sexy , shy , big boobed girl . , her boyfriend who is afraid of something in the relationship , a stupid slut blonde , the token black guy . , the rebel without a cause smart alleck guy / brother . , a stoner . , violence , swearing , and gore . What more could a horror fan want ? Plus ! Paris Hilton dies ! That is the main reason why you should watch this film ! That's the plus ! You have got to admit that's a good one .
482622	1293485	412798	6.0	I think it just could have been more	I was so not interested in seeing Half Light , I'm not much of a Demi Moore fan . Especially since her recent publicity of Charlie's Angels , I mean , a person gets plastic surgery , and everyone worships them ? It doesn't work for me , but then when I recently went onto IMDb , I just was surfing and found my old love , Hans Matheson and saw that he did this movie and how I passed it so many times at the video store . So , as shallow as it sounds , for an old memory , I figured I'd give this a watch . Half Light is about a woman who has just lost her son to a horrible drowning , she has guilt over it because she was supposed to play with him that day and could've prevented it . She is getting a divorce and deciding to write her next book out in the country of Scotland . She meets a handsome young man , but then finds out that supposedly he's been dead for some years , but there is more to figure out to the story later . It's a good story and could've been so much , I actually might have enjoyed Demi . But the problem was that the story kinda bored me and it seemed to drag on . It either could've been summed up or the maybe it was the writing or the actors , but I think you get my point . Especially when you see this movie , but judge for yourself .
483580	1293485	408524	6.0	I liked the original better	Since I finally remembered to rent The Bad News Bears at Hollywood Video , I decided to rent the remake instead of the sequels first , to see what the remake was all about and I thought that actually Billy Bob Thorton was a great choice for Buttermaker , so I was kinda looking forward to it . Of course , I watched the original first , so after almost dying of laughter from The Bad News Bears , this film had a lot to live up too . Unforutnatley , I don't think this film worked as well because of the dates , the 70's , films still seemed like they could push it to the edge , while into today's world , we have to be more PC . Not to mention the kids were more annoying and punky than the lovable punky kids in the original . Buttermaker is a has been baseball player and now an alcoholic , he is given the job of a little league coach for the Bears since no other fathers are taking the job . But he's definitely taken back when he finds out that the team he is coaching are kids who are , well , I guess you could say " lacking " in the department of knowing how to play baseball . But he just wants to get paid and get the job over with , but when their first game comes along , the kids get creamed 26-0 , Buttermaker is pressured to drop the team out of the league , but instead teaches the kids how to play and recruits a couple of new kids , a girl who's mother he used to date , and a rebel without a cause . The kids get better in each game , but it's a matter of Buttermaker getting his priorities straight when he lets the game get the worst of him . . . and he's an alcoholic ! Billy Bob did do a good job as the new Buttermaker , but he seemed to be the softer version than Walter , so I'd have to vote for Walter if I want the real Buttermaker . Tanner , I was incredibly disappointed with , because he just turned into an annoying brat than a fun little punk , not to mention I was ticked off that they changed the line " shove the trophies up your . . . " to the other kid , that was Tanner's line and rightfully so ! While Bad News Bears had a couple laughs , it just wasn't needed , stick with the original .
482028	1293485	64276	6.0	Born to be wild	Ah , the 60's . A time of peace , love , hippies , drugs , sex , freedom , etc . In my film class I took a couple years back , we watched a clip of this movie during our " Decade of the 60's " week . I learned that only a few good movies really came out of the 60's , like the Graduate and West Side Story . But it wasn't that big of a decade for films . " Easy Rider " was trashed at the time and considered a trailer trash type of film . This day , it's considered an art form and a classic to many . When I finally watched the whole movie , I couldn't really pay attention . The whole thing to me felt like an acid trip . I know it was the 60's , but man , this was out there . I'm not really sure if this is a classic to be remembered . All I know is that his movie is about getting high , getting drunk , Jack Nicholson , and riding motorcycles . : D So for the movie appreciators , this is for you . Otherwise , I don't think many would really enjoy this film .
483297	1293485	315733	6.0	There's no point to it	I just didn't understand how this movie was so raved about in 2003 , I remember it was up for some Oscars , I believe , and I heard about it from several people on how dark it was but interesting . Well , I rented it the other day and decided to give it some time to think about it , still I came up with the same conclusion , it had no point . Normally most movies have a moral or some kind of meaningful conclusion , I'm not saying that some films could be different , and we've had those types of films , but still this one just made absolutely no sense . I think because the pace was just so slow and really couldn't get to the point , I lost interest . Cristina has just lost her husband and her two daughters in a horrible hit and run accident , realizing that she would loose her husband due to massive brain damage , she lets him go and donates his heart to another man who is dying and needs a heart transplant , Paul . Paul looks her up and instantly falls for her despite being in a loveless marriage , he would do anything for Cristina , including killing the ex con who is now a religious freak who killed her family and part of her life . There's more to the story , but that is the summed up version of pretty much what it is . The acting was not bad at all , in fact I would say that is very decent , it was the story and how it was edited that didn't work for me . I think the story had some kind of meaning that could have been better explored or told in more sincere way . Doesn't make any sense I know , but I would just warn you that this movie is somewhat a waste of time .
483375	1293485	443489	6.0	Pfft ! I can see why it wasn't nominated for best picture	I was excited about seeing Dreamgirls , especially after seeing the Oscar nods it got . But I still wasn't too sure about Jennifer Hudson's win , after all , before I saw this film , I saw Babel , and the Hispanic actress who was nominated I felt totally deserved the award . But how can you judge before seeing what Jennifer Hudson's raved about performance was all about . Now I have to start off with that actually this was a good film , but you know what ? It was average , nothing thrilling or original came out of it . It's your typical rise and fall story that had nothing special or had no spark . Jennifer's performance was good for a first time , but I still wasn't too thrown over it . The story is just so abused and too used by so many writers . Curtis is looking for a backup group for his famous singer , James Early . He finds the Dreamettes , three beautiful and strong black women , he also becomes involved with one of them . Slowly they rise to the top , but Effie , the girl is involved with is not exactly " thin " or that " appealing " to a younger crowd , so with her girlfriends in the group , her brother , and her new boyfriend , Curtis , they vote her out of the group and the Dreamettes become huge , but the joke is on Curtis when Effie gets a second chance . The performances were the key that got raved about most in the film , now I have to say that they were good , but honestly , it was nothing beyond good . I don't have anything against Jennifer Hudson , but I am very upset with all the publicity she is getting now for one film and an Oscar that I believe doesn't belong to her , but I know there are some that wouldn't agree with me . Eddie didn't thrill me either , I've actually seen him in better , but I have to admit the only performance I was actually , and surprisingly , impressed with was Beyonce Knowles , she has come a long way . So , I'm not sure if I would recommend this film , if you wanna watch it , go ahead , but don't expect too much .
482880	1293485	120906	6.0	A little slow paced if you ask me	While I admit gladly that this was a really entertaining story and Bill and Ben work so well together , for some reason this just wasn't to me an good movie to watch . I also definitely fell asleep on it twice , which is a bad sign in my case . Bill plays a detective who is trying to figure out a blackmailer and where a tycoon's keys are . But unfortunately for him his partner played by Ben Stiller , he wants to quit and settle down with his girlfriend . Also , Bill happens to fall in love with the blackmailer from what I understand and it gets in the way , big time . Not my type of movie , it was kind of boring to me . I know that IMDb users will not find this comment useful , that's OK . I don't want to spend a paragraph on why I didn't enjoy the movie , you're just going to have to take my word on it .
483387	1293485	343737	6.0	Oh , no , Joe !	I think my friends must think I am the biggest freak in the whole world because I was crying after this film . I was so looking forward to seeing Joe Pesci , I mean the man hasn't done a film in almost 8 years , he's one of my favorite actors as well with Robert DeNiro , so this film was so exciting to me . Especially when I heard that Robert had turned down The Departed to work on this film , I could only think of how wonderful this film was going to be , I also promised myself I would never dislike a Robert or Joe film . Joe ! Oh , my God ! I cannot believe how he looked ! It was so strange seeing him so aged and he was only in 2 minutes of the film ! Robert , I just don't understand what encouraged him to do this film . Basically The Good Shepherd is based around the C . I . A . and Matt Damon . He is an agent who as a young boy found his father dead from suicide . But a clip of a man and woman making love keeps being brought up , we're not sure where it's going at first , but we realize there may be something going on deep in Matt's family , he realizes after a letter his father wrote , he has become him , maybe worse . Espcecially since he wasn't a good husband or father , only dedicated to his country and when he took the most important things in his life seriously , that's when it's too late . I so badly wanted to love this film , I really did , but it was just so slow and agonizing to get through with Matt Damon playing the lead , he's a good actor , but he's not leading man material . He is in every scene of this movie , now mind you this is a 3 hour movie , but it seemed like he only had maybe 20 lines , I mean , Robert could've cut some scenes in the film , now it's not that I don't mind a 3 hour movie , but it just wasn't a necessary length since it was mostly dragged out . And Matt just kept on making deep serious looks throughout the film , I just couldn't see him in this role . But I don't know honestly , like I said , so much was built up for me and I over all was pretty disappointed .
482272	1293485	219965	6.0	Not your average romantic comedy	I don't know for how long , but my mom has been begging me to watch Bandits , I think because I keep telling her how gorgeous Bruce Willis is , she just knows what I will normally like . So , I finally broke down and watched Bandits last night and over all , I'd have to say that I did like it . It was a different kind of story that was refreshing to be honest , it had an interesting story that really has not been done before . It also has some terrific actors not to mention that all present the story very well . Bruce , Billy Bob , and Cate all had a great chemistry that made the story funny and lovable . But for me , as much as I am a fan of Billy Bob and Bruce , I think Cate was the one who stole the movie and really made the story just such a pleasure to watch . Terry and Joe are two bank robber bandits on the run from the law . They're not your average bank robbers , they are charming and usually get their way with robbing every bank . They are also combined the perfect man : Terry is smart and sensitive and Joe is adventurous and spontaneous . One day when they have to meet each other , Terry hijacks a car with a unhappily , depressed married woman , Kate , who begs them if she can stay with them . Joe decides to let her stay , and they both end up falling for her . But she loves them both and is now on the run with them instead of being their hostage . Bandits is just a fun film over all . I'd say that it's enjoyable and tells the story very well , it has some dark humor in it as well that makes it in some ways light hearted and gives you a breath as well as a laugh . Cate was so beautiful and proved that she could also do a comedy as well as she brilliantly acts in drama's . Bruce and Billy Bob were so much fun to watch , especially in their final bank robbery scene , you'll see what I mean , it's a cool ending . I would recommend Bandits , it's a good film with great actors , just sit back and enjoy .
483600	1293485	433383	6.0	While it is indeed an excellent picture and a great story , I wasn't too thrilled	I know that this movie has more than a few fans and the Oscars went crazy for " Good Night and Good Luck " , please don't hate me or think I have bad taste in films , but the movie just didn't excite me much . My mom and I rented this flick with extreme high hopes and I was more gentle on reviews than my mother was , she fell asleep during the movie , but I stuck through it and went with the story . While it's a beautifully made picture and a story that is capturing , this was just not my type of flick . The characters and type of genre just didn't excite me . The whole movie in my opinion was over all just average . I would however , recommend this for anyone because I think it was a very decent picture to at least watch and give a chance too . Again , this is just my opinion , some pictures capture better to some than to others . So , watch and come up with your own opinion .
482223	1293485	180093	7.0	It's a good movie , but not within my tastes and was a bit too dark and disturbing	My best friend has been begging me since 2001 to watch Requiem for a Dream , for some reason I never really got around to watching it . But recently I thought about the movie and decided to give it a shot . After all on IMDb , it's # 52 on the top 250 . What did I have to loose ? Well , this movie is a trip , and I mean an intense one . This is an excellent depiction of what drugs can do to you and the horrible graphic consequences of continuing the downward path . The acting , we have Ellen Byrnstein , one of the finest actresses , you might remember her from The Exorcist . I felt so awful for her character in the film , now she doesn't get on drugs intentionally , she just wants to loose some weight because she was picked to go on a TV show . So she starts taking diet pills that have the same drugs as speed in them , so unknowingly she continues taking them uncontrollably . Her son played by Jared Leto , his girlfriend Jennifer Conelly , and his friend Marlon Waynes are drug dealers and heavy users themselves , but continue their search for a dream like paradise . This is a good movie in general when it comes to effectiveness , but the best made picture ? Not really , but the acting and story is terrific . I will warn you , this is extremely graphic and should not be shown to children .
482990	1293485	338751	7.0	Visually stunning ; but Martin's best work and best picture ? No .	See , at the Oscars , despite the fact that I had not seen " The Aviator " , I was cheering for it . Because I am a huge Martin Scorsesse fan and I only saw two other movies that were nominated . Leonardo without a doubt has become a very fine actor , and the clip they showed for his nomination of " Best Actor " looked extremely interesting . So , when it came to best picture I was all for " The Aviator " or " Finding Neverland " , but then " Million Dollar Baby " took it and I was upset . Still , I had to see " The Aviator " . While the movie has a very stunning atmosphere and fine actors that can steal the scene , it's not a very interesting story . Howard Hughs , no , I do not know that much about him . In fact , I didn't realize what he really did until I saw this movie . But he just seemed like any ordinary a-hole in life . The movie could have been something spectacular , but the person and story just didn't interest me . So , I'm so sorry Martin , you were not handed anything that could have been gold . This was the problem , because it was too long and the main character wasn't that interesting , you loose track of the film . Otherwise , this is a good all around film to watch for a Saturday . Is it a watch ? Oh , yes . 2 hours and 45 minutes of Leo is a little much to handle . But I would recommend it to see good flick , but that's all it is . Just a good flick . - To Martin : We know you can do better !
483459	1293485	74751	7.0	I wonder if there will ever be a remake that will be as loved as the first one	The first " King Kong " is a classic . It's almost nearly impossible to make a good remake . One that was better than the first . Examples , " The Thing " , " House on Haunted Hill " , and " Thirteen Ghosts " . Those were good remakes . They also surpased the first . This " King Kong " is almost there . It really is . I was impressed . They did of course change a few things . The effects are pretty cheesy , but so was the first one . What did you expect ? I would recommend if you enjoyed the first " King Kong " . Just to see what it was like . As a movie to watch again and again , I'd skip . What do you think ? In 2005 , will it be Beauty that killed the beast ? Again ?
483060	1293485	114168	7.0	Depressing , but extremely powerful and moving	Sean Patrick Flannery is an incredibly under rated actor after this remarkable performance he gave in " Powder " , while the story is very dark and just not pleasant , he really gave it his all into this film and you can see how emotionally connected he is in it . We also have Mary Steinberg and Jeff Goldblum who give their all into their characters , I just think they were not that well developed enough . They could have had a little more . The movie starts off with a mother and father rushing into labor , only on the way , unfortunately is struck by listening in a massive thunderstorm . She does not survive , but the baby does and the father is not only devastated but rejects his son . Sean plays Jeremy or as most people call him , " Powder " due to him being an albino . He is hidden in his grandparent's basement and has never been out of the house . When his grandmother passes , Jessica Caldwill , played by Mary Steinberg , convinces Jeremy that he must leave and they'll give him and home and school to attend . He does leave and slowly progresses towards what he thinks may be a better life . When Donald Ripley , a school teacher , has the I . Q . results for Jeremy for his school , he is amazed . There is no score high enough for Jeremy , he's smarter than Albert Einstein . He can memorize book pages word for word , he knows agonizing math problems , and knows the pain of the world . He also has a mysterious power where he if he is exposed to electricity , he gets electrocuted . He also has the power to make people feel the same pain as they inflicted unto another , he also can read minds . Unfortunately , this isn't making him very popular with the jocks of the school who brutally torment him not just mentally but physically . There is only really Donald , Jessica , and another girl Lidnsey who want to be his friends . Only he's just not willing to except this world of pain when so many people doubt and torture him like Doug Barnum who is the town's sheriff and just thinks Jeremy is a freak . His wife is unfortunately dying and comes to Jeremy to ask for a favor and to help him find out what his wife wants . This scene is so extremely touching and tearful . The scene that got to most to me is when the boys go on a hunting trip and the coach shoots a deer for sport and are just laughing at this poor deer dying . Jeremy then takes his hand on the deer and his other hand on the coach and the coach starts to have somewhat of a seizure , and he made the coach feel the same pain he put on the deer . Poetic justice and well deserved I thought . " Powder " , despite being depressing , is a pretty decent picture worth viewing if you are in the mood for a sappy flick . But trust me , it is worth the it , you get a great performance that deserved more praise by Sean , also the same with Mary and Jeff . The acting just takes this movie to where it should be .
483425	1293485	157503	7.0	Creepy	I know this sounds weird , but this movie creeped me out . I have a friend who's parent was very much like Kirstie Allen's character . So , it was just disturbing to see a parent act like that again . The movie is very funny , and has a cute story line . Kirsten Dunst and Denise Richards make the perfect cat fight duo . I'm guessing some guys must have gotten something out of this movie . : D Kirstie Allen is a great actress and really brought a lot to the movie . She shows how much parents can get obsessed with their children trying to make them into someone . I would recommend the film to anyone . But it is a little disturbing on the parent part .
482694	1293485	389790	7.0	Good , but I'm disappointed	After all the hype we've been getting for Bee Movie , I was so looking forward to seeing this film . It looked like it was a guaranteed hit ; I decided to check this movie out this afternoon and even though I still liked Bee Movie . It seemed just like this was more meant for the adults than the kids , some of the references I'm certain children wouldn't get or even shouldn't get . I'm glad that they are making these movies for also the adults to enjoy , but I think these film makers are forgetting the audience this movie is supposed to be aimed at . Like I did laugh at the Ray Liotta and Sting references , but what kids would get that ? The story was good despite some minor flaws , which I'll explain later , but it was clever . Barry is a bee who is living in the typical bee world where you live , you work , and you die . He's getting sick of it too , he wants something different , so he goes out into the human world . He meets a nice lady named Venessa and decides to break the Bee law and talk to her , they develop a friendship . He discovers in the human world that they sell honey and he's working his butt off for it , so he decides to go ahead and sue the human race for all the honey they sell . But he realizes soon that bee's mean more than just making honey . Bee Movie is cute and has a few good laughs I will always admit , but I'm just disappointed with the humor as well as the script , it seemed just too bland at moments and very predictable . But I had a problem with how the humans handled finding out that bee's can talk , they just accepted it very easily . Like I said I think the humor also was just too aimed at adults than the kids , so I'm not sure if this could qualify for family film of the year . Bee Movie is definitely worth a watch , but don't expect too much .
483002	1293485	425061	7.0	Not as funny as I was expecting , but still a fresh new comedy for the summer	Last year I saw the teaser trailer for Get Smart , Steve Carell throws a phone at the guy from Borat and it's on a wire and stops before it can hit him , I nearly died laughing and new I had to see this film . More and more trailers were released and this movie just looked more and more funny , I just couldn't wait to see it . I got to see it this week and I have to say that I was expecting this to be at least a rating . Steve Carell is such a great comedic actor and we had such a promising cast . Now I'm only 23 years old , so I haven't seen the series , but I know that it's a series that was made by Mel Brooks and was pretty popular back in the day , but I cannot judge it on what the series was . As a movie , I'd say it was good , as an all out comedy , I wasn't too thrilled . It has some really funny moments , I guess I've just seen all the screw ball comedies to the point where I am used to these stories by now . Maxwell Smart works with a secret agency , he's got the smarts , but not exactly the skill to be a secret agent . But when hot Agent 99 is on the case , Max is given a chance to work with her . They have to stop a terrorist who is threatening to blow up a building with the president . But with Max and Agent 99 on the case , Agent 99 being good at the skills , and Max at least having the brains , with the feelings they're doing their best to hide , they stick together and learn a few new tricks . Get Smart is a good movie , I would recommend it , I would more so would recommend though that you wait for the rental , the funny parts were already shown in the trailer unfortunately . The cast though was excellent and did make the movie work very well , the strange thing was is that Dwayne Johnson actually did a good job , he's proving more and more that he's a decent enough actor for the characters he's portraying . Another thing I did like is that they didn't make Max into a total idiot where he is like Steve Urkel or something . It's just too typical , Steve made Max into his own and the movie does still deliver good laughs , just I wish it could have been a little more .
482038	1293485	66952	7.0	Disco Vampires ! Yes !	Count Yorga , Vampire , I remember seeing this movie as a kid and it scared the heck out of me . But I loved it so much , this was just such a scary film to me , well , I'd say I grew up since then , so just giving a review from a new perspective . Count Yorga is one of those films that came from the 70's , in my opinion , a very sexy vampire film , sort of soft core in some ways . It's a classic vampire feel with a typical plot and silly actors , but that is what makes a fun horror movie . In the dark , this is still a pretty intense film . I have to admit though that I have a bit of fun with it now , like the guys who are being fed to the girl vampires , you have several hot chicks who are scantly clad and want to suck the blood out of you ? Yeah , it sucks that you're dead , but still , what a way to go , right ? LOL , at least I thought it was pretty funny . A group of young adults hold a séance for Donna , a girl who has lost her mother mysteriously . Count Yorga , her mother's boyfriend , is a mysterious man who never shows up during the day time and is a bit suspicious ever since all the girls keep disappearing when he came into the group's lives . But the guys are on a journey to get their women back , but it's gonna be hard when they find out that they are dealing with vampires . Count Yorga is a fun horror flick to watch at midnight , I have to admit it still sometimes sends a little chill down my spine . The acting is cheesy and some moments are a bit much , but this is a classic and sexy vampire story that I'm sure if you love a good vamp flick , you're sure to enjoy this one . It's a classic in some ways I think and is a bit over looked for horror films , but it's all good . It has good scares and a charismatic vampire , Robert Quarry did an awesome job , he's very chilling .
482264	1293485	66995	7.0	Plenty O'Toole ? LOL ! Now I get it !	Well , I got it in the film , I just had to come up with a title line . You know , I think I was expecting too much because both my parents said that this is their favorite James Bond flick . Out of the other two I've seen , Goldfinger and Dr . No , this was the third favorite in my pick . Still , I had fun watching this flick . It has all it's cheesy cliché moments in a James Bond flick . The girl he falls for , the great gadgets , and a super villain who needs to learn a little more from his " Taking over the world for Dummies " book . This time there are priceless diamonds that James needs to protect a villain from . Along with Case , his sexy new villain turned good girl / friend , they find a way to trick the villain and once again save the day .
482387	1293485	384642	7.0	Incredibly predictable , but you still enjoy it because it is Will Ferrel	I thought this movie would have been hopeless , but Will was the only thing that kept this movie going . I was only impressed with his comedic performance . There were a few cute kids , but some were very scary . The plot , you pretty much can guess if you have watched " Kindergarten Cop " . But you might enjoy this if you enjoy these feel good movies . You will get a few laughs and giggles . Especially with the little Babison , I think his name was . He was very funny . I would recommend this for a RENT , not what I paid to see it . But it is worth a watch for Will's sake . If you enjoy his work , then you'll enjoy " Kicking and Screaming " .
483053	1293485	103241	7.0	Just wait , it gets better	Right when I began to watch " What about Bob ? " , I didn't think much of it and was getting kind of bored with it . But right at the end , it got much funnier , especially with Richard Dreyfus's character . Despite What about Bob being incredibly predictable , I wouldn't mind giving this movie another watch again . The movie is pretty funny and very heart touching . As silly as it may sound , it makes you question of who is truly insane and who is really normal ? I just loved that all Bill Murray's character needed was just a family who loved him for him . He was a lonely , but such a lovable character . He and Richard together were just great and I would highly recommend this movie for a good laugh .
482413	1293485	88011	8.0	Pretty good	This film delivers drama , action , romance , humor , and suspension . It has everything you could want in a fantasy movie . Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas make a great duo . I would recommend this if you enjoyed " The Princess Bride " .
482999	1293485	493464	8.0	Unrealistically fun !	Back when I first saw the trailer for Wanted , I have to say that I was more puzzled and assumed the movie would just flop , instead I had friends who were just crazy about the movie . I also work at a movie theater , so I saw a lot of the audience walking out and going crazy over it . I had to see what all the rave was about , so my friend and I checked it out a couple days ago and this was one of the funnest action movies I have seen in a long time . One of the things I loved about this movie was despite how unrealistic it was , that was what had made it so much fun , we need a good action movie that you can just let go of reality and just enter this world where you can kick butt while doing the most incredible stunts . Now I'll admit I have never read the comics , this also seemed like the newer fight club , but I think this is one of the funnest movies I have seen this summer . Wesley Gibson has a crummy life : dead end job , a girlfriend who cheats on him with his best friend , and a father he never knew . But all that changes when he meets the girl of a life time , Fox . He meets Fox in a store and not only does she tell him that his father was an assassin who just was murdered , but she has a major shoot out with a man who is the killer of his dad . She takes Wesley to a factory where the assassins maned The Fraternity . Sloan , who is the leader , trains Wesley to be a top assassin and to kill his father's murderer . But at least that's what Wesley is led to believe into a shocking ending . I think Wanted does deliver all it promises , I know there are a lot of people who are upset that supposedly that this isn't faithful to the comic series , but I think that some just need to let go , because no matter what , you have to admit that this was just a wild ride . I'm not a huge fan of Angelina Jolie's , but dang , this girl just rocked and was so hard core , I wanted to be Fox . Morgan Freeman made such a great Sloan , he has a great skill of being a leader and someone that everyone admires ; I also loved his line " Kill this . . . " well , it's a bad word that I can't say , you'll have to see the movie to know what I am talking about . But Wanted is worth your money and time , it's a fun action film that will leave you wanting more .
482061	1293485	83511	8.0	One of the better action flicks of the 80's	Despite how predictable and unrealistic 48 Hrs . was , I ended up loving it ! I wanted to get the famous movies of Eddie Murphy into my movie comment collection . But also on my own , I wanted to see Beverly Hills Cop and 48 Hrs . , because Eddie Murphy always makes me laugh in one way or another . He's done it again with his classic cop movie , 48 Hrs . , and there is no doubt that he stole the show . 48 Hrs . is about two killers on the loose who are after some payback money , Nick Nolte wants to catch them to get a boost at work . So , he gets Eddie Murphy , a convict from prison , to help him catch these guys . But while Nick is a gun happy cop , Eddie is a street smart sass , you get where I'm going if you've seen these buddy cop movies . You know the saying , you see one of those films , you've seen them all . Thank God there isn't a sequel , I'm just saying that sometimes these movies get out of hand . But I loved 48 Hrs . , it was hilarious and Nick and Eddie had great chemistry that will remain eternally classic . I loved Eddie's signature laugh in the film . He's just great and my opinion , can do no wrong .
482930	1293485	497465	8.0	Woody is back and makes an enjoyable movie !	At my movie theater that I work at for some odd reason we got Vicky Cristina Barcelona 2 weeks after it's release , strange , but I don't know how these things work . But people were walking out very pleased with the movie . So I decided to go ahead and check it out , so I watched it this afternoon . Now we all have to admit , Woody has just been out of his game these past few decades , not since Annie Hall has he had a very memorable film . Nor have none of them have that creative edge that Woody has , but he still has something because Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a good movie . It has a strong story and was very different than any film we have had this year . We have a narrator throughout the film that just tells us the story as if he was reading a book . We have a strong cast that they can all hold their own on scree : Scarlett Johansson , Javier Bardem , and Penelope Cruz . They hold a strong chemistry and make the story very interesting . Vicky and Cristina are best friends who are going to Barcelona for the summer , Vicky is a believer of realistic love and is engaged to a successful man who can make her ideal marriage dream work . Cristina is the idealist of a romantic love and meets a Spanish handsome charmer , Juan Antonio who invites the girls to another city for a weekend . He gets Cristina's notice automatically , but Vicky takes some seducing to get into bed . But Juan's crazy ex wife gets back into his life and just makes things very interesting for Cristina . Vicky starts to question her ideals on love when she is just swept off her feet with Juan . Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a very well told story and nothing like I've seen before . Even though I found it to be unrealistic at times , this movie was just different , which we all need and Woody has a talent for showing that , as he has shown us with his private life , lol . But the acting is good and there are some funny moments and some touching one's as well . I loved how crazy Penelope was in this movie , she was like Fatal Attraction scary , yet you could see how Javier's character fell for her so hard , I don't blame him , I found her craziness attractive as well . So I do recommend this movie if you have the opportunity to see it , the characters are cool and the story is wonderful , Woody is back and throws in one last punch in the fight for his career .
482969	1293485	56801	8.0	Unique and interesting	8 is one of the most hailed movies of all time , especially in foreign films , I read in a magazine that this was the number one ranked Italian film . So I decided to rent it and see what it was about , I had no idea what the story was about , but if it's ranked so high on the top 250 , why not check it out ? So I watched it yesterday and this was one of the strangest movies I have ever seen , I almost felt like I was trippin ' with this movie . I know that sounds bad , but I just felt like I was on such a trip with 8 , the camera shots , the characters , the costumes , the story , it was just crazy . I felt like I was getting pulled in so many directions and I wasn't sure where I was going . The story is a little hard to follow , but I watched it again , and from what I understand , I'll try to explain . Guido is a writer / director who is constantly looking for new ideas for his new film . He goes into these strange fantasies of new characters , flying , new situations , and different colors or looks . But the actors that he works with are always looking for the bigger idea , they want something better . But after thinking back to his past , he may just come up with the best idea for a film . At least that's what I interpreted from 8 , this was seriously one strange movie . But the thing that stands out to me is this was a film that stood out very much for it's time , it was one of the first films that made people stop and seriously think about what they saw . It was one of the first major artistic films that had incredible camera shots and interesting characters , before the fancy effects of CGI , we had 8 . 8 is a good movie , it's something you'd really have to be in a mood for though and you may have to watch it a couple times , but it's definitely worth it if you want a classic .
483651	1293485	454841	8.0	A breath of fresh air , I'm talking movie and theater experience together	OK , so far this year , I have had the worst experiences with Hollywood films and movie theaters . First off , movies , let's face it , Hollywood has lost a lot of touches and it's magic . The originality is just gone and I was thinking with " The Hills have Eyes " as just another lousy remake my friends were dragging me too , but wow ! I must say that I was extremely impressed that the movie was entertaining and actually one of the best remakes of 2005-2006 . Theater experience , we have all admitted it , we hated going to the theaters last year . The parking and ticket prices were outrageous , not to mention pretty lousy movies didn't help either . But mainly I heard more complaints about the audience , nor do I blame either , I was majorly ticked off with the way the audience behaves now a days . But this was a better experience in the theater , people were quiet except for EXCITING moments , and had their cell phones off for the entire movie ! The audience screamed when necessary and we all clapped for the action moments towards the end of the movie . This was the best theater experiences I've had in a long time . Now , the movie was great . Having Wes apart of the team I think helped a bit because it kept the feel of the original horror movie . It had perfect scary moments , cliché's that will always get the horror fans going crazy , and a great story . I would highly recommend this movie any day ! What a great time !
482438	1293485	70016	8.0	A nice little kid's flick	I think every kid has to see this movie . It's a charming and delightful little flick . I wish they would make more movies like this than all the fancy computer effect movies of today . I'm serious , I think this is more impressive as far as animation goes . Charlotte's Web is a great flick to watch . Even though I enjoyed the book more as a child , I still loved to watch this film . I would recommend it for children . It's a little cheesy at times . But it has good lessons and morals . Hence , why I say it's for kids . There are some catchy toons though . Even the adults might still get into it .
482942	1293485	378194	8.0	It builds up to nothing	Finally , after the long wait to rent Kill Bill Vol . 2 , I watched it . I was so excited . I thought the first Kill Bill was great . But I was a bit disappointed . First off , a clearence to fans of Q . T . I do think that Quentin is very good at what he does as a director . But he is still like any other director . I tend to notice that every film he made , his fans act like it was the greatest movie in the world . So , to any fan reading this review , it is just my opinion . SPOILER ALERT ! ! ! The beginning is great . Great dialouge , acting , and action . There is more drama and explination than the first Kill Bill . Elle's kill is the best by far with the removale of the other eye . And the black mamba is a great touch . We finally get to Bill . The big and final show down . And we're going with it . This has been the Bride's goal since the first movie . And she just kills him within 5 seconds . It's very lame and pathetic . And her child just accepts her into her life like as if she had always been in her mother's life . Over all , it's a good movie . It just is a little disappointing .
482481	1293485	241303	8.0	If chocolate is considered to be evil . . . then . . . oh , boy	I need some churching . " Chocolat " is a cute little town film . All about a woman who newly arrives into town and makes chocolate . When she turns down an invitation to church , everyone thinks bad things about her . They even consider her chocolate to be evil because it tastes so good . She befriends most of the townspeople . Excluding a few who don't like her at all . She even befriends the " rats " who sail in once a year . She happens to fall for one of them . But she is still pressured to leave due to her delicious chocolate . The film is well done . The story is alright . But the acting takes it all . I would recommend especially for Johnny lovers .
482050	1293485	35575	8.0	Dedicated to the great George M . Cohan	Ever remember those songs that we've sung every 4th of July ? Like Yankee Doodle Dandy ? Not to mention those plays we always had to do in elementary school when learning about the Declaration of Independence or The Constitution ? Well , Yankee Doodle Dandy is one of the first biographies about George Michael Cohan . It's a fine picture with great music and terrific actors , including James Cagney . George was named after George Washington , our first American President , because he was born on the 4th of July . His whole family were a singing group , very popular at that as well . But as George grows up , he is cast out by the very person that got his family started in theater . So , he partners up with Sam Harris and makes his own successful musical called " Yankee Doodle Dandy " , along with meeting a very beautiful woman named Mary and makes her his wife . This is such a cheerful and lovely movie that can be seen for the whole family . It's a true classic with beautiful music , lovely acting , and just a great picture . I really enjoyed Yankee Doodle Dandy , and anyone else who enjoys the classics .
481929	1293485	95953	8.0	A movie that will make even the most macho man cry	I have to say that this is Tom and Dustin's best performances by far . They are such a wonderful duo together . I love seeing how Tom reacts to Dustin's character . Two brothers , one being successful and the other mentally challenged , are finally reunited . They both learn how to live with each other and eventually learn to love each other . As for a best picture , I wasn't too sure . But the actors will impress you . I would recommend this movie to anyone . It has wonderful characters and some great laughs . But also some very touching moments . You really have to like this movie . It's too memorable to miss .
483320	1293485	454945	8.0	Yeah , a bit predictable , but still enjoyable	I have to be honest , I really had a good time watching She's the Man . Despite it being a typical teenage comedy or if you will the switching of the sexes movie , it had some pretty decent laughs that I think anyone could get . Adults and teens alike would over all enjoy this movie . Amanda Bynes is your typical rebellious teen who dresses and acts like a guy , and when she is turned down to try out for the boy's soccer team , she decides to take over her brother's appearance to prove herself worthy of being on the boy's soccer team . Of course , love shows itself when she meets another guy who thinks she's her brother . She also has a girl who is chasing after her . Well , the tag line says it all . This is a fun little teen drama that I think will be remembered for a while . Amanda Bynes did prove something in the film , it's really hard to really act like a guy . : D Well , it's true !
483446	1293485	373926	8.0	Better than a 6 . 6	I just recently had the pleasure of a viewing of " The Interpreter " , and despite my doubts and not being too interested , I still rented and was pleasantly surprised . I really enjoyed " The Interpreter " , it had high drama and action and a real plot that for the most part any adult can understand . It had a lot of real issues of today and the terrorist plans . The acting is great , I mean we have Nicole and Sean . Although I am curious who else noticed that they were never placed side by side ? LOL , because Nicole is like 5 foot 11 and Sean is like a midget ? I'm sorry , just my friend and I thought that was noticeable how he or she would be sitting down and either or would be standing . The plot is very interesting and keeps up your curiosity due to today's strong stand on terrorism . Nicole Kidman plays an interpreter for the White House and government who happens to over hear a secret plan to kill a country's leader . She now needs protection from the secret service , Sean Penn . Guess what ? He's actually doubting her , but you don't blame him because of her mysterious past which she will keep revealing slowly through the movie . It's a high paced drama that is very under rated and should be given a chance . Also , there is more good news , they don't turn it into a love story that would be kind of unrealistic . I didn't get the PG-13 rating for " Sexual Content " . Does anyone ? But anyways , I would always recommend this for a good watch , especially if you like the T . V . program " West Wing " . This is a keeper !
483106	1293485	82766	8.0	Well , a bit over-acted , but still an excellent movie	I just went up to my mom and even asked her that I thought Joan Crawford was real , she said that she was and that this is a very true story about her , may I say that this was a very mad woman ! The way I thought of seeing this movie was that I was watching " I love the 80's : Strikes Back " and they mentioned this movie , it looked so entertaining and crazy , I simply had to see this movie . While I did laugh a few times unintentionalbly , I really did get into Mommie Dearest . It was so intense and disturbing to watch . Mommie Dearest is based on the real life of Joan Crawford , an actress who is praised most of the time , but sometimes put down quite a bit . She wants one thing , a child of her own , but since she can't get pregnant , she adopts two children , Christina and Christopher . As she gets older and gets more rejections from studios , she becomes a raging and abusive alcoholic , not to mention a neat freak , I don't think freak is a strong enough word . The children learn how to deal with her as long as she lives and does their best to survive . Over all , despite the fact that it is over acted , I think this was a pretty good movie . It kept my attention throughout the whole film and I am surprised by a low rating . I know Joan would throw a fit , so out of respect and fear ; - P , no just kidding , just because I really did like the movie , I'm going to be very fair .
483685	1293485	109686	8.0	Jim Carrey at his best	I love Jim Carrey . He is honestly one of my favorite comedic actors . And I heard so much about this movie , that I just had to see it , and I laughed up a storm . Every joke in this movie gets a giggle at the minimum . I would recommend this if you enjoyed " Liar Liar " .
483561	1293485	55928	8.0	Another James Bond Classic to remember	James Bond in Dr . No , from what I understand this was the debut of the 007 films or at least one of the first . I have to say that I really enjoyed Dr . No . Maybe even a little better than Goldfinger . Again , I've said before , I'm enjoying this in the fact that I'm getting more Austin Power jokes . Not to mention finally I know where Dr . Evil comes from . Dr . No is the new villain and he has an island where he is killing everyone who steps on it and plans for world domination . But James along with a new honey , ironically named Honey , will stop him and have enough time for cuddles and smooches . So far out of Golfinger , I think I liked Dr . No better . But I would never dismay anyone from either films , they're both a blast to watch .
483516	1293485	90756	8.0	Very odd , but intriguing	Before Little Children , before American Beauty , there was Blue Velvet , and American masterpiece of it's time . I came across this movie a couple years ago , but I wasn't too sure about it , but it was recommended in my 1001 movies you must see before you die book . Not to mention that I like Dennis Hopper , so when I noticed that he was in this movie , I got a little more excited to pick it up . In some ways I'm glad I waited to see Blue Velvet , just because I don't think I could have appreciated it like I do since I'm a little older . While I do think it's a bit over rated than what I was led on to believe ; this was still a very memorizing film with incredible performances . The story is so dark and disturbing , just proving that the most perfect little town has it's very dark and scary secrets . Jeffrey has come home to his very sweet little home where it is on the bound of leave it to beaver style of families and friends . But unfortunately , his father had a heart attack and is in the hospital , so Jeffrey is left on his own , while he's walking home from the hospital , he comes across a disembodied human ear , brings it to the local detective . He meets the detective's daughter , Sandy , and together they think they can solve this crime . It leads them to a woman , Dorothy , who is a singer , and makes Jeffrey into her lover , but he learns that a messed up druggie , Frank , has her in a deep hold of dark secrets and leads him into a life that he never expected . Blue Velvet was the silent success of 1986 , not to mention a first of it's kind for movies . It was kinda like one of those " look closer " films , that was pretty rare for it's time . If you enjoyed American Beauty or Little Children , I would highly recommend this movie without hesitation . The acting and whole look of the story was so memorizing . The only thing was that the story did work , but it still had an empty feeling at the end for me . I just felt like it could have had a better introduction . But over all the film picked up and this is a good one , folks .
482647	1293485	430922	8.0	So much funnier than I was expecting	After seeing the trailer for Role Models , I thought it looked like a funny movie , but I wasn't expecting much , I was thinking they might have just shown the great parts in the trailer and that would be it . But I took the opportunity and saw Role Models the other day and I have to say this is completely opposite from what I was expecting , first off I was worried that there was going to be a lot of gross humor and the kids might be more annoying than funny , but it turn out that this was one of the funniest movies I have seen this year . I just couldn't stop laughing throughout this film , who knew that Sean William Scott could actually be really funny ? I know there are a lot of Stiffler fans that will hate that sentence , but I don't remember a time that I laughed so hard at his character . He and Paul Rudd both worked so well together and were terrific on screen , this was the last duo on Earth that I expected such great laughs from . Wheeler and Danny both work for an energy drink company , but after a very hard day for Danny he crashes their company truck on school property , but his ex-girlfriend , Beth , who is a lawyer is able to get them just 150 hours community service with two kids , one is a total dungeons and dragons nerd and the other is just a pain in the butt . You know how the story goes , Danny learns how to be happy and Wheeler finally grows up into a more father figure role . Now the story is something we have seen a million times before , but it's still a great comedy . Jane Lynch who is becoming one of my favorite comedic actresses , you've also seen her in 40 year old virgin , she is just absolutely hilarious in this movie and has all the best lines " You know what I ate for breakfast ? Cocaine . You know what I ate for lunch ? Cocaine . . . " she is such a great and fun actress to watch on screen . I really loved Role Models , it turned out to be a great comedy and was an absolute blast to watch . I highly recommend if you get the chance to see it , take it , it's a guaranteed laugh .
483675	1293485	106856	8.0	We are D-fens !	You know , to those people who claim that this is racist or too violent , I think that they are just scarred . Because we all have thought like D-fens . The day that I saw this , I was visiting my friend , it was supposed to be just a one hour drive that turned into a three hour mess because of construction on the express way . I just wanted to get out of my car and walk to my friend's house , it would've been a lot quicker . Not to sound psycho , but also , I wanted to scream at the construction workers , they are destroying a perfectly fine street ! They charge more on the express way tolls now to put me in traffic for a longer time . The food mart , how many of us wanted to ask " Why do you charge so much for a bottle of pop ? " To street gangs , if we get off your " territory " , why do you still want to beat up innocent people ? The list goes on and on . Watch this movie and give it a chance . It's very true and we all can put ourselves in D-fen's shoes .
482815	1293485	167404	9.0	A surprisingly good ghost story	I remember this coming into theaters , and my sister telling me that it scared the crap out of her . So , I figured I'd see it . I didn't know what to expect . But I was shocked , this was a very clever ghost story . With a surprising ending . I won't spoil that though , it's too good to spoil .
483621	1293485	196229	9.0	" Don't you think there is more to this life than being really , really , really , ridiculously good looking ? "	" Zoolander " is a hysterical movie that has non-stop laughs and endless memorable quotes . I'm not kidding when everyone had told me that " Zoolander " was one of the funniest movies they'd ever seen , so I had to give it a chance . I'm really glad I did . Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson give a parody on male super models that is beyond tears of laughter . Ben Stiller plays " Derek Zoolander " , a 3 time " Male Model of the Year " award winner , when his streak of wins is stopped by Owen's character , Hansel , he starts to doubt his career and wants to go back home with his father and brothers as a mine worker . He pretty much fails due to the lack of his being used to high maintenance type of environment with clear air and less , well , work . When his father tells him that he's no longer part of the family , Ben gets the offer of his career or so he thinks . Will Ferrel plays Mogotu , an evil model agency owner who is trying to kill the prime minister of Molesia so he can continue to have children make his clothes . He figures people would assume that Derrek has lost it with his career so he can easily frame him and brainwash him into killing the prime minister for him . When a journalist played by Ben Stiller's wife , Christine Taylor , Matilda finds out about this , she tries to save Derrek by hiding him " where no one would know he's there " , hence at Hansel's house . Hansel is very forgiving and confesses that he was wack and Derrek was his inspiration to be a model and Derrek claims his wack of being jealous . There they have strong tea and learn of the lacking in Matilda's love life and why she hates models . Hansel playfully says " I think we should get naked . . . don't talk , just give into the power of the tea " . Followed by a very strange but amusing orgy where Derrek just happens to fall for Matilda . But Derrek will NOT miss a show and there is a certain " relax " ing music that will cause him to kill the prime minister of Molesia ! Can he make it past the beautiful celebrities and save the day ? Ben , Owen , Will , and Christine work perfectly together in this great comedy about male super models . This movie has non stop laughs and you'll immediately buy it when you see it . If you can't laugh at this movie and it's amazing rounds of cameo's , I don't know what's wrong , because this movie doesn't deserve to be under a 7 . 0 . Trust me , this is a great movie !
482364	1293485	373889	9.0	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix	Yes ! I cannot believe I have now seen all the Harry Potter films , at least for now ; ) . Well after watching the last four Harry Potter films , I was definitely interested in seeing where the story would lead us next . The Order of Phoenix was absolutely astonishing and without a doubt the best Harry Potter yet . See , my friends who read the books didn't get much of a kick out it like I did , but I think they were just comparing too much book to movie . Who knows ? After reading the books , I'm sure I'd be like that too , but movie wise I thought this was a great movie to watch and a terrific film for the summer . Harry is having extreme nightmares ever since the death of his fellow classmate , he knows Veldemort is on the loose and will do anything to stop him . But at Hogwarts no one believes him , especially the newest addition the professors , Delorus Umbridge , and this woman is here to make student's lives an absolute night mare . In the mean time Voldemort has plans for Harry and must get his hands on a prophecy that Harry has . Harry gathers classmates that finally believe him about Voldemort and join into an army that will end in the ultimate battle between good and evil . The Order of Phoenix is a roller coaster ride of action and a great story . The actors were terrific and the movie had great effects with the best story yet . I cannot wait for the next Harry Potter film , I admit it , I'm hooked . I can't wait to start reading the books , I bought them today , I guess I'm on the band wagon of the Harry Potter fans , if you can't be them , join them , lol .
482667	1293485	60153	9.0	It's a " Splash ! " of good times	Batman , the best superhero of all time is finally in techni-color . And is coming to a DVD near us . Sorry , just had to get that out , I mean this movie leaves you will a cheesy goodness that is Batman . I know a lot of people always criticize and make fun of the series , but I don't understand how anyone could hate this ? Yeah , it's a complete turn around from the original comic books , but it's just non stop laughter and even the actors were aware of that . You just have to love the sprays that Batman has , " Shark repellent " ? LOL ! Not to mention the fun villains who are just so " filthy and diabolical " . I am in love with this script , I mean , it's so cheesy , but it did it on purpose . Like when Batman finds out the true identity of Catwoman and Robin says " Holy Heartbreak ! " . Or my favorite scene that is possibly my favorite scene of all time , where Batman has a bomb in his hands and is trying to get it out of people's way so they won't get killed , but no matter what he keeps bumping into the same marching band in the streets or finding people in the way , and finally he just sighs and says " Some days you just can't get rid of a bomb " . CLASSIC ! Please , watch this movie , it's beyond hilarious , just pay the $5 . 99 for the movie !
482970	1293485	414055	9.0	This is the year for Cate's Oscar !	When I saw the trailer for Elizabeth : The Golden Age , I was a little baffled , I know this is going to sound so bad , but I was thinking " Oh , great , the sequel to Elizabeth , Elizabeth : The Search for More Money " . I mean , they ended the movie Elizabeth so well , why did they need another movie ? But after Cate's Oscar nomination , I decided to go ahead and see the movie and just see if it was any good , I watched it yesterday and I have to say that Elizabeth : The Golden Age was really good . I'm a little surprised by the rating of a 6 . 9 , I thought they presented Queen Elizabeth with the great honor and strength that she deserved . Cate Blanchett was astonishing , her performance was just incredible , it's almost like this was the role that was just meant to be her's . She brought Queen Elizabeth to life like no other actress has before . Queen Elizabeth has taken rule to England , she is still childless and unmarried , the war between the Prodestents and the Catholic's is still going strong , since Elizabeth is a known Prodestent , many people do not want her on the throne . Mary Stewart is Elizabeth's cousin and many people believe that she should have taken the crown and will assassinate Elizabeth just to get their way . For once Queen Elizabeth's emotions are starting to show , she's frightened and worried what is going to happen to her and her kingdom , but with the reassurance of the adventurer , Sir Walter Raleigh and old friend , Sir Francis Walsingham , she feels the strength to go on and go into war with the Spanish . Elizabeth : The Golden Age is a remarkable film and I was really impressed with how they presented Elizabeth , she was so strong and admirable . The film itself is great as well , while it's not strongly accurate , the story is terrific , I know they had to give it a little something to grab the audience's's attention . But the sets , the costumes , the characters , Clive Owen made a great performance out of Sir Raleigh , he was the perfect choice . I would recommend Elizabeth : The Golden Age , it's a terrific movie and I hope Cate gets the Oscar she very much deserves for the performance of Elizabeth .
483629	1293485	108941	10.0	A well thought out horror story that could be true one day	Now of course the battle between good and evil was brought by Stephen King . But , the whole story about the " Super Flu " could come true . And that is the most terrifying part of the story . Several stars to the cast and crew who did a great job on " The Stand " I'm sure that it took a lot of work . Over 5 hours to kill is all you need . Of course if you're like me with " I can't take it anymore ! I need to stand up ! " , then just watch one episode every day .
483113	1293485	352248	10.0	A new Rocky for the ages !	I wasn't really too interested in seeing Cinderella man , I'm not too into Russell Crowe movies , but my friend convinced me to take a peek at it and just give it a shot , so I figured why not ? Over all , I'd have to say that I have to thank my friend tomorrow , because this was a wonderful and inspiring movie to go the distance . Set during the depression , this movie takes a dark tone to the story , I think that's the thing about this movie that I loved and most others did too . Almost all of the people on IMDb have not lived during the depression , we know that they were hard times , and Cinderella man got to take a glimpse at what it was like to live back then . It was so touching to see this family struggle but stick together . I can't imagine what Renee's character was going through every night not knowing if her husband was going to come back alive or not . This is a beautifully acted and sublimely directed filmed movie with magnificent sets and a terrific and inspiring story . I think anyone could get into this movie , even if you're not too into the boxing flicks , but believe me when I say if you enjoyed Rocky , there's no way in heck that you could not enjoy Cinderella Man , a new inspiring tale for generations to come .
482801	1293485	151804	10.0	Who doesn't want to do these things ?	I loved " Office Space " and I see many others love it too . I think because we can all relate to it , the beginning with the traffic sequence , I was thinking " Ahh ! I just went through that the other day " . Also when the friends were talking about what they would do with a million dollars and Livingston's character said " I'd do absolutely nothing " . It sounds lazy , but come on , I'd do the same thing . I'd like to stay in bed instead of going to work or school . I think many people would like to do that as well . I loved Milton , he was without a doubt my favorite character . He was just so hilarious and sympathetic . Lumberg , he is so much like my boss , always rather going at other people's conveniences than his own . I loved how Jennifer Anistons's boss kept on giving her a handful when confronted about her " flair " at work . I just felt for all these characters . This is a great movie that should not be missed . I'm serious , do watch this movie . You better be at blockbuster right now !
482187	1293485	317313	10.0	Michael's last fantastic album in his finest moments	" Thriller " has always been my favorite M . J . album and " Bad " would be second . But " Dangerous " is a wonderful album as well . " HIStory " wasn't bad . And videos from " Dangerous " you wanted to see or miss you should get " Dangerous : The Short Films " . Not only do you get his wonderful videos , but you get his glory days .
482390	1293485	369339	10.0	An exciting and high packed action thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat	What excellent performances ! Why didn't Tom Cruise get nominated for an Oscar as well ? I thought both him and Jamie did a remarkable job in " Collateral " . This movie was a lot of fun to watch . Everyone told me that this was the movie to watch if I would rent , so I figured to give it a shot . The whole movie you just keep wondering what would happen next and how it would turn out in the end . It was kind of weird , because you feel like Tom was in some ways right as a hit man , but then you snap back into your senses and " Wait ! No ! He's killing people ! " . I'm very serious when I say that he is so in tune with his role . He was very convincing as well as Jamie . Jamie does well as a man who is on the edge of insanity . I felt like if I were in the same situation , I would've reacted the same way too . You eventually just loose it and do your best to keep it together doing things you never expected to do in your life . This was a very terrific movie , and I would highly recommend it for anybody .
483301	1293485	416449	10.0	Brutal and Spectacular !	I have to say that this for me has so far been the biggest shock movie of the year , after seeing the trailer to 300 , it looked like such a pathetic excuse for computer animation . But my friends wanted to see it tonite and I figured why not ? I couldn't believe my eyes and how excellent this movie was , I mean , visually it was actually stunning as well as the battle sequences were beyond crazy ! So far , I would say that 300 is the best movie I have seen in the theater so far this year . It was so exciting to watch , every scene had one shock after the other and the battle sequences were so amazing to see , how the Spartans defended themselves , they were absolutely awesome ! It's based on the Spartans , their lives and how they came to be what the legend that they are to this day . When they are threatened by the Persians that they will be turned into slaves , the Spartans decide to defend themselves along side with their king . Going against incredible odds of only 300 Spartans to thousands and thousands of Persians and horrible monsters , they pull together and become the strongest team of all ! But the Persian " lord " will not give up until he claims victory over the team that is beating them down like they're nothing . It had great dark drama around a light humor that would give you a breathe of fresh air . The scene with the king looking up to see all the arrows coming towards him is one of the most amazing and unique scenes I have ever seen in cinema . I would Definitely recommend this movie for anyone to see , it is an incredible movie with intense battle sequences , terrific acting , beautiful settings , and a great story . I guarantee you will not be let down .
483594	1293485	43014	10.0	Why aren't there more movies like Sunset now a days ?	I've said it before and I'll say it again , movies lately have been major disappointments and there are no more memorable films . So , I decided to reenergize my faith in Hollywood and I'm watching nothing but the classics now . Who hadn't heard of some reference to the line " Mr . DeMille , I'm ready for my close up " ? But unfortunately I never knew what film that came from . I purchased the book " 1001 movies you must see before you die " and finally the reference was answered and I rented this movie without hesitance . Sunset Blvd . is just an incredible movie and just so amazing . I wish there were movies like this now a days . I loved Norma's character , just how insane she was yet trying to stay so glamorous . You felt so awful for her character despite everything . And not to mention an unforgettable ending to this great story . High recommended ! There is hope for Hollywood , there is !
482053	1293485	86960	10.0	Classic Eddie , timeless !	I recently bought the best of Saturday Night Live : Eddie Murphy , and I just about died laughing . Unfortunately , before that I only saw like three of the episodes of SNL with Eddie on tape , Eddie was kind of before my time , but when I got to see the best , I was really excited and my mom asked me if I ever saw Beverly Hills Cop , but I didn't . She went out to buy it and I just watched it , I nearly died laughing . Eddie plays Axel , a tough street smart cop from Detroit . His convict friend comes to visit him with some phony bonds , but ends up getting murdered . Axel decides to take things into his own hands and goes to Beverly Hills to find his friend's killer . He ends up getting followed by the Beverly Hills cops while he's on the case of Victor Maitland , the number one suspect for his friend's murder . Eddie has some amazing scenes in this movie , my favorite is where he has to get into the restaurant to see Victor again and he acts gay and says he has a disease that he has to tell Vic about to the host . This is a terrific movie and really shows the many talents of Eddie Murphy , the guy is just great . What a laugh !
482800	1293485	362269	10.0	Let's talk about sex	Alfred Kinsey , what a guy . I have learned a lot this year about human sexuality . It's a fascinating subject and not perverted if you take it seriously and in a mature manor . I went to Italy and England , I live in America by the way , and things were so different there . People were very open about their sexuality . Men greet each other by hugging or giving a kiss on the cheek . Being a homosexual wasn't an embarrassment , I saw two girls making out on the street . When I came back to America , the most people do on the streets that I've seen is a man and a woman kissing . I'm not sure why people are so afraid of sexuality , because I do not believe it is a sin . Whatever higher power or none that you believe in gave us these feelings to express . That's why I enjoyed the film , because everything Kinsey said for the most part was real and true . Everyone is so scarred to admit that they've kissed the same sex or had some kind of an " unusual " experience . I'm not kidding , I think this movie should be shown to teenagers 13 + . If that's offensive , I'm sorry . But I don't think we should keep these feelings secret anymore . This a very serious subject and we should be more open about it .
482443	1293485	253474	10.0	Excellent , depressing , but excellent	Man , I can not get this film out of my head . It is so rare that a movie can affect me the way " The Pianst " did . The last movie that did that was " Casino " . I was really tired when I was watching the movie . It was almost midnight , so I was thinking that I'll start watching and I'll finish it in the morning . Did I ? No , indeed I did not stop watching . I couldn't stop it . I just wanted to see what would happen next . I cried during " Schindler's List " , I sobbed in this film . Everything that happens in this film is so sad . Adrien Brody does a remarkable job of acting in this film . I would very highly recommend this film . Especially if you are a history buff . Please , I think this film should be in the top 10 best films of all time . I looked on the message boards you know and some other user comments that didn't enjoy this film much , they criticized Adrien Brody's performance and say that he was boring and only showed emotions that are easy to act . Please , you have got to be kidding me . This man portrayed the total feeling of hopelessness , being alone , being hated . I one time had an audition in high school like this to see if I could improvise , and the way I imagined this feeling is like in dodgeball where you have no one else on your team and you're the only one left standing , yet on the other team there is 20 big men that are just waiting to wack that ball at you . Adrien couldn't have done a better job , I was so frightened for him and cried for him during the whole film while he was one the run . Roman Polanski as the director , he himself escaped the terrors of being a prisoner in The Holocaust , yet he lost his mother and other family members . Yes , I'm sure this film must have been hard to re create for him , but he was probably the only director that could have done this movie as brilliantly as he did . He created this story and made it so effective , I called up my mom and told her that I loved her so much because we take so many things for granted . True , this isn't the 1930's or 40's , and we are in America . But it's still frightening to think that human beings are capable of that much hate and being so brutal to another human . World War II is one of the most frightening wars in history , if you read more about The Holocaust , you get more into it and you should . If you are not interested , then watch this film . It's a must see , otherwise how else will we learn from our mistakes ? The Pianist is a beautiful and extremely dark tale about a man and the struggle to survive . The ending is so powerful and moving to know that sometimes one man can make a difference in a crowd of so many and I'm not talking about Adrien Brody's character . You'll see what I mean .
483050	1293485	60196	10.0	For a girl who doesn't enjoy westerns much , this was one of the greatest films ever !	Gosh , The Good , the Bad , and the Ugly , I finally saw this film ! Who hasn't heard of it ? First off , may I say that Clint Eastwood . . . what a hottie in his day ! : D Sorry , had to get that off my chest . Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's . I mean , I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical . Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy , drama , and war . The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters . By far my favorite character was The Good , played by Clint . He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him . When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200 , 000 , they go for it . Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe . The Good , The Bad , and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic . Let's give it up for Sergio !
482975	1293485	408236	10.0	The best musical in years !	Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is one of the year's most talked about films , it's getting big Oscar buzz and of course , what could be better than Tim Burton taking on this dark musical ? With Johnny Depp starring along with beautiful Helena Bonham Carter by his side , this movie just screams terrific . My mom and I saw the movie today and Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street lived beyond to my expectations . Tim Burton hasn't exactly released a classic lately that would be remembered for all time , but Sweeny Todd is sure to make it's way into one of the most memorable films of 2007 . Johnny Depp and Helena both have incredible voices , they were so hauntingly beautiful and magical together , it's like these roles were made for them . Along with an equally strong cast as Alan Rickman and Sacha Baron Cohen who were also incredible , Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a new memorable musical for years to come . Sweeney Todd has come to London on a mission , a mission for revenge ! His wife was taken by the evil judge for his own pleasure's with her and Sweeney's daughter . Now Sweeney's daughter is grown and is being held by Judge Turpin and he has been informed by his lover , Mrs . Lovett that his wife has died . " At last my arm is complete ! " Sweeney says as he raises his faithful razor and wishes to kill the vermin of the world as well . Mrs . Lovett comes up with the clever idea to create a tasty meat pie of the victims and makes quite the popular business . But Sweeney is determined to find his daughter who is being wooed by his young friend , Anthony , and kill the judge who has taken everything from him . Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street was so beautifully shot . The reason why I love Tim Burton so much is because he knows how colors and contrasts work in a film . He knew how dark Mrs . Lovetts and Sweeney Todd are , in a picnic scene where everything is supposed to be bright , Sweeney and Lovetts are the only dark figures in the lovely setting . The music is triumphant , the songs were so memorable and almost hypnotic , I felt like was in a real Broadway audience . Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is one of the best films of the year , I guarantee it , this was a terrific musical that was a bloody good time ! Tim Burton is back and he's better than ever with Johnny .
482462	1293485	469641	10.0	As emotionally disturbing it was to watch , it ended up being an incredible surprise of a great film	When I first heard of this movie being made , I had so many debates about this film , I almost hated Oliver Stone , after all , we just had only the 5 year anniversary of . I thought he was going to make some action movie of a horrifying and nightmarish event that is still fresh in most of our memories . So , I refused to see this film , but a girl at my work told me that it wasn't like what we both expected at all and that it was a great film . So , my friend and I decided to see it , I have to say that it was beautifully done and showed great respect for that horrible day . Gratefully and I must thank Oliver Stone , he didn't reenact or computerize the planes crashing into the towers , this movie just focused mainly on the policemen and firemen who gave their lives that day and to two strong and brave policemen who ended up in the most brutal and hellish nightmare , being trapped and buried alive under tons and tons of what was a 110 story building . Their struggle was so brutal to watch , but it kept your hopes and strength alive . 95 % of the world only witnessed what happened on the outside , finally , this movie showed us what it was like to be in New York and what the firemen and policemen went through , along with their families . I have to say that it was so mentally disturbing though to see the towers in the beginning of the film , I actually started sobbing , because it's still to this day unbelievable that they're just not there . But still , it was pictured perfectly and beautifully done , I loved that they showed how much of a normal day it was for all of us before the plane hit the first tower . It's a beautifully acted and hopeful film that will make you remember that that day not only showed the worst evil in people , but it brought out some of the best and heroic acts anyone has ever witnessed . RIP to those 2800 people who lost their lives that day , you will never be forgotten . And on a special note , thank you to the firemen and policemen who fought , survived , and died on that tragic day , you may have done your job , but it was the most heroic thing anyone could have done , they saved more lives than we realized . Let's not forget .
483042	1293485	805564	10.0	I know that this was not the intention of the film , but Lars and the Real Girl is one of the saddest movies I've seen	When I was reading what was considered to be the best films of 2007 , Lars and the Real Girl came up quite a few times , I wasn't sure since I had never heard of it before . But I decided to rent it and see what it was about , I watched the film last night and this was not only the most charming film I've seen , but for me it was one of the saddest . I think it just touched me how much this town stuck together to help one friend and get him back from a " delusion " , just unfortunately , it was semi-unrealistic at times , and I think that's what made me very sad , not to mention how lonely a person can get , I think we forget that sometimes . But the script was just so wonderful and Lars was just this character who actually didn't really seem crazy , like this dummy fantasy was something that made him come out of his shell , this story was just so beautiful . Lars is a shy and quiet man who just keeps to himself all the time , everyone always begs him to join the crowd , but he always backs down . But when his co-worker shows him a website with a " create your own sex doll " , Lars gets one , but not exactly for the purpose of sex , more like it's his girlfriend . Not like he's ashamed , he thinks she's real , her name is Bianca , and he even asks his brother and sister in law to keep Bianca in their house . Instead of hospitalizing Lars , the town pulls together and helps Lars by treating Bianca like a real person . Lars starts to come out of his shell and then even notices a girl , Margo , but he realizes that maybe Bianca isn't everything he's wanted in life . Lars and the Real Girl is seriously one of the sweetest films ever . Everything about this film was just wonderful and it was such a pleasure to watch . To be honest I am surprised that Ryan Gosling didn't get an Oscar nomination for Lars , he is one of the most touching characters in film that I've seen in a while . His scene with Bianca , the last one where he kisses her , there are no words , but it was such a touching scene , I turned into such a girl ( I am a girl , but I don't get all sappy normally ) , I cried so hard , it was just a beautiful scene . I would highly recommend Lars and the Real Girl , it's a great movie , has terrific performances , and just an original and lovely script .
483562	1293485	95159	10.0	Another hilarious movie that I almost died laughing at	I don't know how many things I have heard about A Fish Called Wanda , it just seems to go on and on . I've heard references from the game " Scene it ? " , the book " 1001 movies you must see before you die " , and Bravo's " 100 funniest movies of all time " . This movie I have just not been able to get away from and lucky enough my mom had this movie on VHS , so I watched it a couple nights ago , and I nearly died laughing at this movie . All the characters , you can't really choose a favorite because of the fact that despite their bad behavior , you love them . I have to say my favorite scene was when Otto was trying to get information from Ken and he tied him up , and when he was sticking the french fries up his nose and eating Ken's live fish . Oh , my God ! I was just laughing too hard for words . Every line in this movie is beyond funny and the scenes are just great . Each skit works together and the cast had such a good time , you could tell .
482026	1293485	385690	10.0	Absolutely hilarious !	Released straight to video , " Stewie Griffin : The Untold Story ! " is a barrel of laughs ! Any Family Guy fan will enjoy this movie . Even though I'm not the biggest fan , I enjoy the Stewie jokes and bless one of my friends , he was kind enough to buy this for my belated birthday present . I just couldn't stop laughing , this was just so funny . I was a little surprised though , since it was released straight to video , they bleeped some of the swear words . But it's still a lot of fun to watch and the parodies are great . I would highly recommend this if you are a fan of Family Guy or at least like the jokes .
483466	1293485	94947	10.0	The # 1 rule of seduction is don't fall in love !	" Dangerous Liaisons " is this incredible movie that is so under rated . It's the battle of the sexes and this book was written over 200 years ago ! I love to know that there was this same problem that we still have to this day . That's why enjoyed " Dangerous Liaisons " so much because it proves that we have so many differences from the opposite sexes . Men are usually expected to have sex and with a few clever words destroy women's reputations in minutes , while women have to be careful of sleeping with whom , because it's considered shameful . Glenn Close plays Marquise Isabelle de Merteuil , a proper lady with a secretive double life of sex and wishing to destroy a girl's reputation for revenge on her ex for dumping her for this young lady . She also makes a bet with her closest friend , Vicomte Sébastien de Valmont played by John Malkovich , that he could not bed a lady of such high stature and morals , in return if he succeeds , he will finally have the conquest he's been dreaming of , bedding Marquise Isabelle . I don't care what people say , this was Glenn's best performance and she was so brilliant . Her speech of " Dominate your sex and avenge my own " was perfect and as a woman I rooted for her in the story . She is a tragic figure that was over looked by many as just another slut . Glenn had my sympathy and I agreed with a lot of her dialog . John as Valmont was absolutely perfect , he's not that sexy looking but has such charm and charisma on the screen you believe him as a lady's man . " It's beyond my control " , he repeats this several times throughout the film and it becomes more darker each and every time he says it to Michelle's character . He does the Marquise a favor of bedding young Cecile to help the Marquise's plan of revenge and does such a good job . It was almost too easy for him , but he has a more difficult task of bedding Madame Marie de Tourvel who is married and has very high morals and standards of God and love . He falls in love with her in the process of getting to know her and is so believable , you can see how it breaks his heart to break her's . But he feels he must stand by his reputation and your own heart goes out to him despite his cruel manors as a " man " . Michelle Pfeiffer as Marie de Tourvel is so beautiful and elegant and is the only one who knows of Valmont's true side . But she cannot help but fall for his charm and love for her , when she talks to his aunt , this is one of the most true speeches ever in cinema that all women can relate too " I'm sorry to say this but those who are most worthy of love are never made happy by it . Do you still think men love the way we do ? No . . . men enjoy the happiness they feel . We can only enjoy the happiness we give . They are not capable of devoting themselves exclusively to one person . So to hope to be made happy by love is a certain cause of grief . " That is so incredibly and painfully true that Marie knows better but can't help but give herself to Valmont . Swoosie Kurtz , Uma Thurman , and Mildred Natwick are all so exceptional and amazing as well in the film . They truly bring the story to life and keep it going with their dialog and actions . Keanu ? Shudder , his acting is like . . . how do I put this delicately ? I think it's . . . wood . : ) Otherwise , trust me this is one of the best movies of all time . This deserves higher than a 7 . 6 and should be in the top 250 . But it's beyond my control . :
482640	1293485	110148	10.0	5 hotties + awesome vampire book = # 1 Vampire movie of all time ! ! !	Interview with the Vampire is hands down probably the number one vampire movie . We got to see a story so unique and original , the eyes through a vampire and his world . Normally , we see Dracula getting chased around by Van Helsing , all we know is vampires are usually bad and must be destroyed , yatta , yatta , yatta . But this time , we not only experience how Louis became a vampire , but what his life became of it . Anne Rice would truly be proud of how much a great movie her most famous book turned out to be . We have some great and very attractive actors who star in this film like : Brad Pitt , Tom Cruise , Antonio Bandares , Christian Slater , and Stephen Rea , not to mention a very young and new Kirsten Dunst . The story starts off with Christian Slater interviewing Brad Pitt , who plays Louis , he makes the most interesting statement to Christian that he's a vampire . Obviously , Christian doesn't take this seriously , but Louis offers him one thing : his story . Louis was born and grew up during the time when America was just being discovered in the late 1700's , he just lost his wife and child in labor , a little different than the book , but anyways , but his misery brings him to wanting death , and Lestat , played by the brilliant Tom Cruise , brings him that with becoming a vampire . Of course Louis doesn't realize what he gets himself into , but Lestat does what he can to show Louis the perks of being a vampire , even if it means bringing in a child , Claudia , played by Dunst , and turning her into a vampire to keep Louis with him . But Claudia and Louis look at Lestat as a warden and won't let them go , so they attempt to kill him and flee the city of New Orleans to France . In Paris , they meet a group of thespian vampires , they kill people on stage as if they were in a play . " Vampires pretending to be humans pretending to be vampires " . Louis meets Armond , played by Bandares , and Santiago , played by Rea . Armond is obsessed with Louis and tells him that Claudia shouldn't be a vampire since she is so young and ends up destroying the thing that means most to Louis , I won't spoil it . Which leads Louis back to the interviewer where Christian is starting to question his doubts of Louis being a vampire . Interview with the Vampire is a terrific film that is just beautifully directed and the actors are just so brilliantly charismatic , it's just impossible in some ways for someone not to enjoy this movie . I know my friends who are not into horror films ended up loving this one because of it's interesting story . It's just a great film that I think everyone should get the chance to see .
483489	1293485	102926	10.0	" The Godfather " of all thrillers	I've seen way too many thrillers . You name it : " Identity " , " Seven " , " The Usual Suspects " , etc . , etc . , etc . I remember my friend being so obsessed with " Silence of the Lambs " , that it drove me crazy . And I hated the movie naturally and refused to see it . But everyone told me that I have to see this , so I let my guard down . And had an open mind , and I'm glad I did . My friend was right , this is a great movie . It is so well acted , I couldn't even describe . I loved " Silence of the Lambs " and would recommend it to anyone . It's creepy and exciting . Trust me , you'll love it .
482864	1293485	97757	10.0	Life must be great under the sea !	The Little Mermaid is one of the best Disney films of the 80's ! It's such a wonderful film and is such a tear jerker , lol . The songs , the story , the animation , the voices , were just so wonderful and perfect . This is the film that I'm sure will go on for generations to come , I just showed it to my cousin recently , he's 6 , and he just loves it as well . I remember watching this movie when I was a little girl and I just wanted a friend like Sebastian , he was so much fun , even though he's somewhat of a buzz kill , he can really get the party going . Just the whole story is a blast to watch and is so beautiful . Ariel is one of the many princesses of King Triton's mighty kingdom under the sea , but she has a different dream . She goes up constantly to the shore to collect human items and wonders what it would be like to be a human instead of a mermaid . One day when she gets into a nasty fight with her father , Ursella , an evil octopus woman who wants to take over King Triton's kingdom , grants Ariel's wish , but she can only stay human if she can get her crush , Eric , to say her name , sounds easy , right ? Well , Ursella takes her voice away , but her intentions are for Ariel to fail and make sure that she takes over the kingdom . The Little Mermaid is such a fun Disney film and is a great treasure of our time . I just love the song " Under the sea " , it's so much fun to sing and dance too , I admit it , I'm a dork , I still sing and dance to it when I see it . I highly recommend this movie for anyone , it's a true Disney classic that is so much fun , I guarantee you that you might shed a tear when Ariel says " Daddy " , you'll see what I mean when you watch it .
482337	1293485	332375	10.0	" I am filled with Christ's love ! " - LOL !	I have heard a lot about " Saved " , for the most part they were really good reviews and also it was the rebirth of Mac Culkin's career . But I am not huge on Mandy Moore's acting , so I hesitated , but was willing to see what the hype was about . Mandy , I owe an apology , because she without a doubt stole this movie , her performance was flawless . To be honest , her character scared me the most , because unfortunately , I knew someone who was EXACTLY in every way like her character . She was holier than thou , and truly acted like it when all that she's doing is hiding behind God and his philosophy . A lot of issues that were brought up in this film I could relate too . I have some gay friends who are really put down by most of America , but I thought the same as Mary , where if God had created us so different , why are we only supposed to follow Christian's rules ? We feel the pressure of religion and just trying to follow the rules so carefully because if their is a Heaven , we would like to go there . Saved is a great teenage film and I more than highly recommend this movie . It has some great and funny lines that are so memorable . I think it's a necessary film for teens to be honest , because most can relate to it in some way . I'm definitely buying this one !
482899	1293485	120815	10.0	One of the best war movies ever made	I'm starting to think that everything that Speilberg touches turns to gold . This is probably considered one of the greatest movies of all time and it is directed by Speilberg . The movie is incredable . The beginning was horrifying . I couldn't believe how accurate it was and painful it was to watch . When I studied WW2 in high school , I thought no one could ever re-create the Beach of Normady . But Speilberg did . I felt like I was there with the soldiers . I felt their fear , pride , and love for their country . I couldn't believe how much dedication our armies put into fighting and winning the war . And whenever I go to visit Washington D . C . , I have more American pride then ever . I am more than proud to give this movie a
482802	1293485	384806	10.0	Ah , that's much better !	The Amityville haunted house , the most popular house in America . So many stories and what goes by your beliefs is what makes it alive . After seeing the trailer for the remake of " The Amityville Horror " , I knew I had to see this movie . But I never had an interest in seeing the original , but I figured if I'm going to see a remake , I might as well see the original . I didn't like the original that much , it was kind of boring and dull to me . So , I was scarred to actually go see the remake , alas , I waited for the rental . I wish I saw this in the theater ! This was an awesome movie ! I was actually scarred at some scenes . I normally don't go for remakes , but seriously , if you want some Amityville action , watch the remake . It's much better , it goes more into the story , and it's just all around creepy . It has a sense of the Shining and the Poltergeist films . Trust me , you won't be disappointed .
