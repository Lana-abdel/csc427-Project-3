483590	1293485	118539	1.0	Was it just me , or did anyone else feel like they were watching a Kraft cheese commercial ?	I swear at the beginning with the parents , I felt like they were just smiling too much and it looked like they were just going to say cliché ' things like " Oh , you kids ! " or " That's coming out of your allowance " while smiling at the camera on cue . Now , granted , this is a movie for kids , but I think we are starting to insult our kids just a little bit . I mean , we do actually have a decent cast for a kid's flick , but these adults really sunk beyond the kid's humor . While it has some good morals and another happy ending , just the jokes got old and I think we are just insulting our kid's intelligence and humor . PS : Loni , lay off the fake tan !
482288	1293485	118137	1.0	" When confronted by a werewolf , it is important that you immediately leave your car and run out in the open "	LOL , I just saw this movie from Mystery Science Theater 3000 , well , actually it was the first episode I ever saw . But I didn't remember the movie since that was back in like 1999 , but I just recently saw it again and I have to say that this movie was just an utter disaster waiting to happen . I feel awful for these siblings of Oscar winning actors , it seems like they get the crummy roles . So my sincere apologizes to Joe Estevez , it's bad enough your brother gets awesome roles , then your nephews as well ? Poor Joe , let's take a moment for him while I try my best to describe this movie . OK , from what I gathered , a group of archaeologists dig up werewolf remains . Now a group of scientists take the remains , but not before one of the archaeologists gets a cut from the remains , and becomes a werewolf ? So this guy , I think his name is Paul , starts to infect people wanting them to become werewolves while his hair style changes on a minutely basis . Then this girl , Natalie , would like to save him . . . and she ends up with a bad consequence with no explanation what so ever . This movie is just plain bad , believe me . I am so sorry that I had to see this film , but it was awesome watching it with Mystery Science Theater 3000 , that's the only way that makes this film tolerable . I loved the scene with the couple's just making out and the girl gets out of the car while she sees a werewolf and runs out in the open , while her boyfriend just stays in the car . LOL , great MSTK3 episode , bad movie .
482632	1293485	466342	1.0	Hee hee hee . . . I don't get it	OK , let's start from the beginning of the movie , now a fat girl is roaming the streets dancing around like an idiot and being rejected by all the guys and looking like a fool . How is this funny ? Then wow , a fat red head having a African American father and an Indian mother ? To boot a Japenese Jewish sister ! Wow , I am just in tears of laughter . Actually , not . Then taking all movies that need no paradies ( i . e . : Napolean Dynamite , Meet the Parents , Meet the Fockers , Shallow Hal , Say Anything , etc . ) , using the exact same lines and only adding someone's stupid joke to it , yes , indeed it's so clever . You may ask why did I see this film if I really had no interest in seeing it , unfortunately , my friends forced me ! People , trust me , this is a big miss movie that needs no viewing and that the makers should be ashamed of . Hollywood , you're getting too pathetic . To all the people who are reading comments just to see if this movie is a winner , trust the unfortunate fools who actually paid to see this flick , you might gouge your eyes out with a fork or loose all faith in Hollywood after witnessing this horrible mess they call a film .
482160	1293485	92076	1.0	Oh , please tell me they did not do this !	I hated this movie ! It just completely ruined the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre . Why ? Oh , why did they make this movie ? Little SpoilerNow is it just me , because I thought that when Leatherface came in with a chainsaw and the girl was sitting next to the beer , and Leatherface hit the beer with the chainsaw and it was spraying all over her , wasn't that rediculous ? Good God ! I can't believe this isn't on the bottom
482468	1293485	443649	1.0	I never realized how good the dental insurance was back then for cave men	OK , after hearing many horrible reviews for 10 , 000 BC , I have to say that I was really put off , this I was assuming was supposed to be the big kick off to the huge block busters . But I got to see it for free , and I always think that sometimes people just misjudge a film , even though my co-worker warned me , I still went for it and saw it . Thank God the movie ended when it did , I had the neuce around my neck by the end of this film . I mean , seriously , did the " writer " do any history homework ? ! First off , let's talk about appearances , the " cave men " have perfect teeth , have evolved well for what's supposed to be over 10 , 000 years ago , and remove the dirt , they're skin belongs in a Neutragina ad . Script ? Was there one ? I have no idea , the story made absolutely no sense and the ending was horrible . I don't want to give away what happens , but trust me , I think you'll be as confused as I was . I'm going to try my best to explain the plot to you , it's high school drama with cave men , so bare with me . De'Leh is a cave man with his tribe and has earned the title of " best warrior " , he is allowed to have any woman , so he picks his childhood sweet heart , Evolet , but he later feels as if he didn't earn that right , so he " gives her up " . She is kidnapped by another gang , oh , no ! Whatever will he do ? He gave her up , but he still digs her and never even got a kiss ! So he goes after her with a few of his friends and find themselves fighting saber-tooth's , monstrous snow storms , a snake river , and even a god who got a bad nail job . Oh , let's hope he can save his girlfriend in time and all will be well . That's the Cliff's Notes version I can come up with . May I just say that I absolutely loved how the cave men spoke perfect English , seriously , I didn't realize that it was possible for them to speak that well in American English . This script was written for 12 year old's , seriously . Then they put in these awkward jokes , strange characters that are more laughable than serious , and a love story that would seriously be so non-existent if this was an accurate portrayal of history . I don't mind when they " bend " the truth for dramatic purposes , but this was the friggin ' Seasamse Street version of cave men history . Stay away from this trash , it's just a waste of time , sadly , how many good movies could have been made with the budget they probably put onto this film ? I'm seeing at least 7 already .
482646	1293485	1045655	1.0	Let's put it this way . . .	After this painful movie , I drank , I did illegal substances , I even beat myself with a shovel , and still I was in pain from watching this horrible movie ! The Haunting of Molly Hartley or as I'm going to call it from this point on " pretty white kids with satanic problems " , where do I eve begin on how awful this film was ? OK , let's start with the actors , horrible horrible actors that only got their roles because they were just too beautiful to pass up on . The editing / scare tactics : let's make loud noise constantly , that'll make the audience jump . The script : let's make up a non-sense story about a teenage girl who has powers from Satan and we'll put her in high school with other pretty people and while she has to go through the hardships of being a teenager . Even though the story in no way makes sense , we have a Zac Efron look a like , so we're going to get a huge female teen audience and they'll love this film . Oh , boy , I'm rambling , OK , let's just say this , if you were , you'd see all the bruises on my head from banging it on the wall after watching this movie that I'll never know how it got green lighted . Molly Hartley is the new girl at school who is very subtle about her strange side , she has headaches that lead to disillusions about her mother who tried to kill her a few years ago , she automatically stays away from people and is getting hit on by the most pretty rich boy in the whole school , but she is absolutely refusing to do anything until her father takes her to the hospital and they find a brain tumor , so it seems like everything will be all good after they remove it , but things are obviously not getting better when her mother escapes the insane asylum to kill Molly before she hits her 18th birthday to gain full powers of the devil . . . yeah , wow . Oh , boy , I wish there was a rating lower than 1 , because honestly this film is one of the worst I've ever seen in my life . It's just so odd to me that there are some films that people absolutely refuse to give a fair chance , yet this movie that has no right to be called a horror movie has a 3 . 4 rating ? Come on , this belongs in the bottom 100 here on IMDb , I'm going to be a good citizen , please , stay away from this movie , save yourself the pain I had to endure . I had to take my cousin to see this , now I feel that I can never let her pick a film again , because for my health's sake , I just can never see a movie like this again , I'll go insane . Just trust me , this is a very very bad film , film ? Why did I say that ? This is trash , just trust me , the only thing horrific about this is that I wasted 90 minutes of my life that I will never get back . . . I could have watched paint dry , that has more meaning than this stupid movie ever will .
483725	1293485	106262	1.0	I tell ya , the new generation sucks	Well , at least this was the last sequel that I could find at Blockbuster , because this movie was just downright horrible . I mean , I can understand how hard it would be to get rid of an evil house . We're talking starting a horrible fire , bulldozing , flood , etc . But a mirror ? How hard could it be can it be to get rid of a mirror ? ! This was the most horrible movie that could've put the title of Amityville into the picture ! Well , a group of friends who are pretty much from the start , are a bunch of freaks . One of them is a photographer of some kind and buys a haunted mirror from a homeless creepy guy , teaching me a valuable lesson , don't buy things from homeless creepy guy . Of course , the horrible deaths and chaos ensues this group , though I can't imagine anyone missing them . Please , skip Amityville : A New Generation , I've already got a few complaints about my generation , so I think this was a premonition . Not to sound so crazy . : P But believe me , this is horribly acted , not well thought out , and not even scary ! I feel so bad for the original writers of The Amityville Horror , they must be crying every time person witnesses this film .

482931	1293485	118589	2.0	Dear Mariah Carey , You Rock ! Love , Mariah Carey	OK , I just had to see it , I don't know why , but you know how when you see a movie on the bottom 100 , you're just so curious if the movie really is that bad ? I remember back in 2001 how Mariah Carey was trying to so hard to be on top of the world , have a record and movie reach number 1 in one year , but everyone knew this was a typical movie where a pop star should just really stick to their day job . I don't know why Mariah thought this was a good idea , it's just so typical . Now granted , I do believe this was a bad movie , but as far as bottom 100 goes . . . I don't think it was that extremely bad , it's better than most pop star trying to be a movie star movies like In the Cut . Glitter is just poorly written and has bad actors in it , that's what makes it so unbearable to watch and makes Mariah look incredibly desperate for everyone's approval . Billie Frank was put into a foster home as a child when her mother lost the house to a fire , Billie grows up and becomes a back up singer in a group . But when a local DJ , Dice , hears Billie's voice , he wants to get her to sing his songs and become a power house sensation in the music world . They engage in a romance together and everything seems to go well when she is finally exposed and then gets exploited . But of course it starts to get into the way of her and Dice's relationship and she begins to realize the pain and sacrifices she must make in order to make it big . Glitter is just a cheesy movie , it doesn't do any harm , that's the reason for the merciful rating I'm giving it . But I'm just really surprised by Terrence Howard who is an incredible actor and he did this crummy movie . But then again we have Al Pacino in Gigli , it's one of those scary stories of life where if the money is good , what the heck , let's get the big star in it . Mariah looked so uncomfortable on camera and did a horrible job of acting . I feel bad because I'm just complaining so much about this movie , but if you're looking for a cheesy movie , I'd recommend Glitter , but it's torture on the brain , it made mine hurt that's for sure when I thought of all the money that was wasted on this box office flop .
483193	1293485	863005	2.0	Wait ! . . . . What ?	I just rented Blackwater Valley Exorcism because the cover and pictures looked terrifying , and I don't normally watch movies that are automatically released onto DVD , but this looked so interesting and scary ! I was very much in the mood for a good scary film and to me , possession is one of the scariest subjects to watch or learn about . Just look at The Exorcist or The Exorcism of Emily Rose , both terrific movies that made break-throughs not only horror wise , but story as well . Blackwater Valley Exorcism is about a girl , Isabelle , who from the get go is automatically possessed , so we can't even tell what kind of a person she was to begin with . But a former wife beater turned priest is on the case with a gardener . . . ? I know . . . I know . Then they go into several other stories with the priest and Isabella's sister , and the priest hit the sister and messed around with Isabelle ? I'm not sure , then we get into a story with Isabelle's dad and his questioning of his wife's faithfulness to him . I mean , the story just goes into too many directions and wasn't well developed at all . Not to mention that the exorcism didn't seem authentic at all and more of a just scare your pants off type of a film , which I didn't like at all because I couldn't take it seriously . Whoever directed and wrote this clearly had no idea where to go or how to direct the story well , so I wouldn't really recommend this .
482323	1293485	377818	2.0	Hot diggity dang ! This here movie deserves itself a couple of Oscar statues ! Pfft ! Ha ha ha ha !	Now , just to let you know , I didn't want to see this in the first place , but I guess I was kind of curious and decided to let go and just see maybe if people were just bad rapping this movie because of it's pretty crumy cast . Well , curiosity killed the cat , the cat was lucky ! : D I never watched the original " Dukes of Hazzard " show , it was on before I was born and I was never really interested in watching it either . So , I had to judge this souly on the movie itself . Well , we have Sean " Stiffler " Scott , Johnny " Jackass " Knoxsville , and Jessica " Oh , yeah , I'm really that dumb " Simpson . We have this exceptional cast , pfft ! I'm sorry , there I go with that sarcasm again ! These people , Sean and Johnny work well together well , because they didn't even have to act much in the movie anyways . They had to be two dumb morons who could do some 50 speed chases with a racist vehicle , geez , what a stretch . Jessica playing Daisy , like I said , I never watched the original TV show , but wasn't the original Daisy a brunette ? Jessica playing a girl who uses her body to get what she wants ? Again , how does she do it ? I mean , wasn't this the girl who claimed she wanted to be be a " good role model " for young girls ? LOL ! Jessica , you sunk ! May I say that the relationship between her and Willie Nelson as father and daughter is close to her relationship now with Joe ? The shower scene , oh , yeah ! Basically , don't waste your money . It's pretty boring and not a well done movie . I'm seriously saying that with my critic's heart and not personal view on the cast . Just this is what I expected I guess , I really did try to enjoy it . But it's just a stupid movie that is not watchable . You'll have to trust me when I say that this movie just is plain horrible . - and I'm being nice !
483121	1293485	265208	3.0	Just take " American Pie " and a couple good jokes and you've got " The Girl Next Door "	I was expecting too much . This looked hilerious in the trailer . I was excited to rent it . But I was a little disappointed . Even though I was kind of happy there were no in your face potty humor , it still didn't get me . I laughed a couple times . This has just been done a million times . I understand there are homages . And I'm sure the director wanted to honor some teen sex comedies . But I've seen to many of them to get into this . Over all , it's not a bad movie . To be honest , I'd rather watch this than " American Pie " . " American Pie " was very gross . This has it's moments . So , I would recommend to anyone above the age of 18 . Otherwise , it's just a porn movie with some kind of a story .
482848	1293485	1139668	3.0	Jumby wants to be in a better movie	Well at least the trailer was scary , from the moment I saw the trailer for The Unborn I knew I wanted to see this movie , it looked so freaky and like the ultimate scare . So before it left theaters , I finally saw it and I should've realized , it's PG-13 , how rare is it that we get a PG-13 horror movie that is actually scary ? Sadly all the " intense " moments were shown in the trailer and I was extremely disappointed with this lousy movie . I couldn't believe how bad it was , it once again has every cliché in a horror film that you can imagine : the black best friend , the loving boyfriend , the hot skinny girl who is constantly in her underwear , the jumps , the mirrors , the nightmares , the over acting . I do have one question : did Gary Oldman owe someone a favor when he took this film ? It's just mind-boggling , he's this terrific actor and he was in this really predictable stupid story ? Well , hopefully he'll recover soon from this sad excuse for a horror film . Casey Beldon is plagued by merciless dreams , visions of strange looking dogs , and an evil child with bright blue eyes . Casey is baby-sitting Matty , her neighbor's son . He is upstairs , supposedly taking a nap . Casey is downstairs talking on the phone to her best friend Romey . Suddenly , there is a voice that says " Jumby wants to be born now , " on the baby monitor used for Matty's baby sister . After yelling , " Matty , are you awake ? " Casey goes upstairs to check on them . Matty was standing over the baby's crib , holding a mirror to the baby's face . After being hit with the mirror , Casey's eyes begin to change color and she learns she had a twin brother who died in the womb . Casey begins to suspect that the spirit haunting her is the soul of her dead twin , being possessed by a dybbuk , wanting to be born so it can transfer to the world of the living . Casey meets a woman named Sofi , who is revealed to be her grandmother . Sofi explains that she had a twin brother who was killed in Nazi experiments in Auschwitz when they were both just children . The boy was brought back to life by a dybbuk who intended to use his body as a portal into the world of the living . Sofi killed her twin to stop the dybbuk , and now it haunts her family for revenge . Sofi refers Casey to Rabbi Sendak , who can perform a Jewish exorcism to remove the dybbuk . This was a huge disappointment , I wouldn't really recommend it . The acting and writing were over done , what could have made this more realistic or scary is just a touch up on the writing . The lead actress Odette Yustman really needs experience , she was just alright in the film . Of course I love the cliché of the crazy black best friend who calls her crazy at first but then all of a sudden is attacked at last second . If you do watch this , if you want a good scare , turn on the lights , I admit there are still some freaky moments , better than most of the PG-13 horror movies , but the story was just bad . It just could have been a lot better .
482636	1293485	110632	3.0	What the hell was Oliver thinking ? !	First off , this movie is a gigaintic music video . Very poor acting . And I didn't see Mallory as a sick twisted girl who just got treated unfairly in life . And Mickey was just plain stupid and sick . Both Mickey and Mallory were very sadistic and should of gotten killed in this movie . It could still be a good movie , but needs a lot of improvement .
482035	1293485	266543	3.0	How the heck is this on the top 250 films ? !	OK , I went to Best Buy the day this movie was released . I just wanted to look around for some movie to watch later in the night . As I was checking out , I noticed everyone had a copy of " Finding Nemo " . Some even had 3 copies ! I couldn't believe it . So , I figured that it has to be some movie . But I knew my aunt bought the movie already , so I'll watch it with my cousins at home . Boy ! Do I regret that . Now , it was cute at times . But not as funny or amusing as " The Lion King " . And computer effects ? I'm getting sick of it . But it's for the kids , I'll let it go . But I'm looking over the top 250 films of all time , and this was on it ? ! Over other classic movies ? ! Why ? All I want to know is why ? ! " The Lion King " isn't on there , but it was the most successful Disney movie . And " Sleeping Beauty " , " Peter Pan " , and " Beauty and the Beast " were not on there . What the heck ? !
482546	1293485	118571	4.0	" The good guys are here ! "	LOL , that just summed up the whole movie , didn't it ? So last night I was looking for a movie to watch and in my mom's collection I found " Air Force One " and I noticed that Harrison Ford was in it , so I figured I would give it a look . So I watched it and all I can say is American Propaganda much ? Now I'm all American , don't get me wrong , I love my country , but this was a bit much and incredibly insulting . If we really had a president like James Marshall , played by Ford , I'd say America would be a very exciting place of nothing but none-stop action . The whole movie either took itself too seriously or then would get into an Arnold Schwartzenegger type of action movie where Ford would say that little one liner before the big climax . Oh , I loved the 25 endings of how they could keep the action going . Now I love action movies , don't get me wrong , but this story was just silly and unnecessary . President James Marshell is on the fight of stopping terrorism , Russian terrorism to be more specific . Well he boards his flight back to the states , Air Force One starts off well , but is quickly hijacked by Ivan Korshunov and his men , terrorists who want their General Radek released from prison in return for the passengers on board , which isn't good since I guess he was hard to capture and is a deadly terrorist . Ivan makes threats to kill of the passengers every half hour if the vice president does not meet his demands . But the President does not chicken out , he stays on board and will fight these terrorists and win back the plane . Air Force One is non-stop action with a mixture of the hit TV show West Wing . Like I said , I don't mind an action movie , sometimes I love the most cliché'd one's , but not when it comes to serious stuff like terrorism , but I think I'm speaking from a post view , so maybe if I saw this movie a before then , I wouldn't have mind it that much , but even then , there were moments that were terribly over acted and for me , it just didn't work for having a president like James Marshall , please , I wish . I can't wait to see President Bush on top of a tanker sporting a look like Rambo , but I guess I shouldn't hold my breath .
482984	1293485	232500	4.0	A teenage punk kid's wet dream	The Fast and the Furious , I remember in 2001 this was the must see movie . I was in high school at the time and I remember the weekend that it opened strangely enough , and I remember the Monday at school , all the guys were just screaming how cool this film was , how " badass " it was , it was so ridicules . So , I decided to steer clear of the fast and the furious films , it just seemed like a waste of time . But recently one of my friends told me that I should give these movies a chance . So I decided to go ahead and see what they were about , plus I had a coupon for a free rental and there was nothing else better to watch it seemed . So I watched the first two fast and the furious films this afternoon , and for the first film , I have to say that it lived up to everything I would've expected . Brian is a cop in LA and is going undercover into the deep dark pimp my ride world of street racing . He meets the head of the LA races , Dominic , who has a gang of people who are loyal drivers and race for money , also a sister who Brian falls for , what a shock , huh ? But there's bad news , there is a rival race gang in the area , The Fast And The Furious became quickly from an action movie to a mystery thriller of who's gang is trying to get the major pimp your ride engines for money . So Brian of course starts to like the gang and wants to become one of them , what another shock . When it comes down to it The Fast and the Furious is the most predictable and horribly written piece of a film you could think of . I don't understand how others , besides a teenage guy , could get into these films . I shouldn't have rented the sequels , just because now I have to watch them to get my money's worth : P But I think it is just silly all the major over the top special effects , it has a pointless plot as well as it's sexist . I'm not saying that to be a pain in the butt , but all the women in this film were used as mostly sex objects , they had no development . But I guess that's what to expect from a film like The Fast and the Furious . Oh , well , at least I could say I saw these films .
483578	1293485	448172	4.0	What started off as an alright film , it ended pretty badly	First off , the first thing that came to my mind after I finished this film last night was " Why the title of 8MM 2 ? " , because I saw the first one obviously , and what did this have to do with the first movie's plot ? The only thing that was similar was the fact that the couple had to go into the porno industry and that wasn't even needed in the plot , because after you see the ending that I will not spoil , it just didn't make any sense . A diplomat and his fiancée are in Hungary and notice a woman who is swimming naked in the pool area , she's very attractive , so when they see her at a club , they decide to have a little fun and have a steamy threesome . But things get extremely intense when the diplomat is mailed pictures of them all having the affair , fearing that it might go public and jeopardize his career , they pay off the guy who sent the pictures , the diplomat freaks out and " kills " the guy , leading into a murder case . He and his fiacee decide to find the girl they had the affair with , but things just get deeper and darker as they go further into what they got themselves into . What could have been an alright thriller , turned into an unexplained and not well thought out movie , which was sad . Like I said , the title really has nothing to do with the first one , so don't fall for it . It's just a sexual thriller that makes no sense , but it's good for those nights alone , because quite frankly this is one of those films where it's so close to porn that it might as well be labeled as soft core .
483022	1293485	117060	4.0	To be honest , I wasn't that impressed	I had heard quite a bit for Mission Impossible , especially now that the third one is about to come out in the theaters . I knew my parents owned the first Mission Impossible , but due to the crazy antics Tom Cruise has pulled on . . . well . . . basically everyone , he has pretty much turned me off of his movies . But , I figured to give the Mission Impossible movies a shot . While over all this is an exciting action / spy flicks , there were only a few scenes in the movie I felt were worth the watch . Obviously the exciting scene of Tom coming through the ceiling on wires and copying the information onto disk . The last action sequence of the helicopter and train with Ethan and our surprise villain , very well thought out , unrealistic , but exciting to watch . Over all , for movie's sake , give Mission Impossible a chance , but it's nothing I would scream or jump on couches about . : )
481932	1293485	106598	4.0	You'll get no more than 2 laughs	Favorite characters from the hit T . V . show " Saturday Night Live " bring a pretty low comedy that doesn't deliver too much . There are a couple laughs , but mostly all you get is a strange feeling after this movie . Despite the characters being non stop funny in S . N . L , they don't really have a life story that can be brought into a movie . They try to live in the suburbs and fit in . The community is questionable about their apperance , but they let them be apart of it . The daughter wants to look and feel normal , and eventually does fit in with her high school . Strange that she has a normal accent of humans , I have to mention . Over all , it's not a bad movie . But I'd only watch it again if I were pretty bored .
482576	1293485	368975	5.0	I felt like I was watching a cheesy teen show on the Disney Channel	I was bored one night and decided to go ahead and see what Sleepover was , it was on TV , figured it might not be so bad . Well , while it did live up to my expectations , I have to say for teens , this movie wasn't so bad . First off , the first time I saw Steve Carrel on the screen , I was like " Is that Steve . . . no , it can't be . Why would he be in a movie like this ? " , and it was him . But I guess we all have to start somewhere . He was an interesting person in the cast , but it's all good . Even though I didn't really like the film , it was worth the watch , I thought it was a good idea for the " tweens " as most people are calling this genre . I suppose who doesn't dream of a sleepover like this one ? I mean it had everything , the girls had a date with their teacher ( sounds sick , I know ) , messed with authority and got away with it , and got the guys . Julie Corky is throwing a big sleepover for her friends , it's the summer before they enter high school , so they are trying to make a new name for themselves as the click crowd . After a bad night , the click leader , Staci wants to have fun and challenges Julie and her friends to a scavenger hunt where they have to do certain things throughout the night and then whoever wins will get the hot spot in high school and have lunch next to the fountain . The girls are in for one wild night and end up with the greater reward : friendships that will last a lifetime . I have to admit that Sleepover has a few cute laughs , I wouldn't deny that some moments are funny . While the movie is still very overly cheesy , it's all good for the audience it was aimed at . It was just so cute how Julie found her " true love " in the movie , lol , I'm sure most teens find their true loves like that in real life . So other than that unrealistic situation , this was just like a J-14 magazine , I feel so preppy and bubbly , I have to watch a serious movie now I think . For the teens , this is the perfect movie for them , for adults , well , begin to feel old , because if this is the way kids act now a days , then I'm glad I'm done with them .
483209	1293485	286106	5.0	I saw it when it came out in theaters , it's been a year . And I still can't decide if I liked it or not !	I was very impressed that there were no computer effects . Or that the director tried to make like pop out in your eyes scary . But I just couldn't decide on this film . It's so hard . I've been pulling my hair out over it . So , my mom got the movie . And I tried watching it again , and I'm still undecided ! How is this possible ? ! Maybe I'm loosing it . Oh , well .
483473	1293485	960144	5.0	Stupid funny , one of the better Adam Sandler movies , but still he hasn't had a real hit since The Wedding Singer	Adam Sandler was recently given on MTV the Generation Award , he was praised for all the " comedy " has given us , from the good old days from Saturday Night Live all the way up to I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry . Back in the good old days up to Big Daddy Adam Sandler has always delivered big laughs and was a always a pleasure to watch on screen . But unfortunately , he's come out lately with the very predictable comedies where you could predict who was going to be in it , what lines would be said and what out come would happen . It hasn't been fun ; Adam has also brought some dramatic roles that surprised us all such as Spanglish and Reign Over Me . He now brought us You Don't Mess with the Zohan going back into the funny accent like he did with his smash hit The Waterboy , sometimes offending us and sometimes just giving us some great laughs . Zohan is the top terrorist hunter in Isreal , everything could just keep going for him , but he hates all the fighting and his life long dream is to actually be a hair stylist . He fakes his death and runs away to America to start his dream , but things don't go so smoothly at first . After defending a man , Michael , from a jerk , Michael takes Zohan in . Zohan finds a little hair salon , he starts off as a sweeper , but then after a stylist quits , he takes a client and does a great job as well as , well , giving her all the satisfaction she could have . Zohan brings the shop's popularity back up while finding his true love , Dalia . But when a taxi driver that Zohan insulted sees him , all the hatred comes back to Zohan ten fold . You Don't Mess with the Zohan is a lot better than I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry in my opinion , but it's still not Sandler's best comedy . I don't think he's had such a great hit since The Wedding Singer , his comedies have just become so predictable and just . . . I know this is a bad word , dumb . You Don't Mess with the Zohan is offensive at times , I'm a white American , and I was offended for the Isreali culture , because Adam does take it a little far . Not to mention the hummus joke goes farther than it really should . But I do admit , there are some funny parts , I did laugh when he went into the children's salon and gave this kid the pinch and knocked him out . Sounds horrible , it's a funny scene though . You Don't Mess with the Zohan has it's moments , but if you ask me , I would recommend to wait for the rental .
483359	1293485	113041	5.0	Kind of ridicules , but still a fun film	The other day I was renting Father of the Bride and I figured to go ahead and grab the sequel . The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first . So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it , so I watched Part 2 right afterwards , I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable . Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother , it's cool , I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time , but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital . That just seemed a little too " coincidental " and out of the blue . But Father of the Bride Part 2 still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable . George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life , he's even grown to like Bryan . When Annie and Bryan come over , they announce big news that they are pregnant , everyone is so excited , except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married , now he's going to be a grandpa ? But the plot thickens , Nina is pregnant too with George's baby , like mother , like daughter , and when Bryan has to go out of town for work , George has to take over , but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help , that won't be too hard . Father of the Bride Part 2 is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times , but it still is a fun film for you and the family . I have to admit that the ending was very sweet , but I won't give that away , you'll have to see for yourself . Steve Martin , I felt so bad for him how hard he was trying to take care of his wife and daughter at the same time , poor guy . Franck Eggelhoffer really delivers the laughs this round , he and Steve , when George falls asleep and Annie goes into labor , Franck tries to carry George and has a hard time is so funny . Fater of the Bride Part 2 is worth the time and look , it's a cute movie over all .
482810	1293485	386140	5.0	It started out as an awesome sequel , but then became very predictable and it lost some spice	I was looking forward to The Legend of Zorro after being very happy with The Mask of Zorro , I have also been falling more and more in love with Antonio Bandares lately . He and Catherine had the greatest chemistry in the first Zorro movie , but it turned into a Mummy's Return kind of romance , where it just fizzled out and seemed to have not as much chemistry as the first . Zorro is back with his love Elena , but she is fed up with him and wants a divorce since he keeps flaking out on his promises of quitting his job and staying with her and their son , Joquien . He barely knows his family , therefore Elena demands a divorce . She moves onto a count , but it turns out that this count wants to destroy and make California his state and not a state of freedom . Zorro must defend the state and win back his family , but can he do it all at the same time ? The Legend of Zorro has some fun humor and great action sequences here and there , but it is the story that fizzles out and it just seemed like everyone lost their edge . If you are interested in seeing this movie , you might want to give it a chance , you never know , you may like it , unfortunately , I wasn't into it .
482745	1293485	87635	5.0	You really have to take it for what it's worth	I decided that I would try to get into the Steve Martin flicks , my mom being such a huge fan of his , she has all of his movies , so I figured it might be an interesting genre to get into . She recommended that I start off with The Lonely Guy , she said it was a cute and sweet comedy that I would get a few laughs at and that's exactly what it was . You can tell right off the bat that this is an early Steve Martin flick , kind of when he was just getting started in his movies , bringing his stand up to the silver screen . The Lonely Guy is about a man , Larry , who just got dumped by his girl and meets another lonely guy in the park , Warren . Together they figure out a way to get out of this lonely guy phase . Larry ends up meeting Iris , an insecure girl who is not sure of what she wants with Larry but ends up falling for him . Larry ends up writing a successful book called " The Lonely Guy " and makes a great turn for the world . Over all , I'd have to say that I enjoyed " The Lonely Guy " , like my mom and I said , it's just a cute and sweet little movie to enjoy with some mild humor that will make you laugh a little . But I'm looking forward to future Steve Martin movies , I think Roxanne might be next .
482444	1293485	252866	5.0	Not a big fan of it , but it was better than the first	I have only met one person who didn't like this film . So , I decided to give it a shot , even though I disliked the first " American Pie " . I have to admit , I had a couple laughs . But there were still a lot of jokes that were too close to the first one . The plot was also the same . I don't mind that too much . But if you didn't enjoy the first one , you won't get a big kick out of this one . I did enjoy some of the jokes . And the story was a point above the first one . So , if you loved the 1st , be my guest . If you didn't enjoy the 1st one , still give the 2nd a shot . You don't know what you may get . Some may actually just enjoy the 2nd one alone . Who knows ? Maybe I'll even watch " American Wedding " .
483245	1293485	338526	5.0	An undecided vote	OK , after reading and hearing of votes for and against " Van Helsing " , I still wanted to see it . I took my mom to see it yesterday after it making a killing at the box office . I am still in a tose . I'm not sure whether I liked it or not . It's kind of like " Signs " , I just don't know if it was good or bad . There was things I liked , Frankenstein's character , Igor , the special effects , and the interesting story . But there were some things I didn't like , Kate Beckingsale's character , they tried to make some of the side kick's funny when they couldn't , and the lame and predictable plots of the story . Over all , you should judge for yourself . I can't really say whether this is a movie ultimatley worth seeing . But it's based on what you enjoy : computer effects or a story . If you want the computer effects , this is the movie for you . If you want a full story , it may not work for you . I'm still tied . Maybe in a year or two , I'll decide . :
483693	1293485	443701	5.0	Weak , there is no point to it	The X-Files , one of the most famous television shows that ended in 2002 , had a movie in 2000 , just came out with a sequel . To be honest , I was wondering why , I know that there are still fans that are shaking to see their favorite agents back , but the story was weak and felt like another episode , just an extended one . Now I did enjoy The X-Files series , I also did like the first X-Files film , so I felt like maybe this was going to be big and have an exciting story , but instead we have just another episode that is trying to have the Saw edge and gross people out . We also have some added characters that are just weak , for example Xzibit as a one dimensional character who is just flat and typical , also , it's Xzibit , I don't know what casting director was thinking " he's perfect " , no offense to this guy , but he should stick to his day job . David and Gillain are also off track and don't have the same chemistry as they did in the series . Fox Mulder has been requested back by the FBI to help them with a case of missing female FBI agents , he meets a priest / pedophile / psychic who is also helping the FBI out with the case . Dana Scully has decided to stay with her current career as a doctor who is struggling to save a little boy's brain disease . But Fox wants her back in work with him and together they discover the darker world that is happening with these missing FBI agents and the Russian black market . The X Files : I Want to Believe is over all not a bad movie by any means , but it's at this point that it seems like the writers were not even trying . Also with David and Gillain , I like to call this movie The X Files : I Want a Paycheck , because they just didn't put their hearts into this and you can tell very much , I thought David hated the series , you think he would have been more stubborn or at least would have read the script first before the paycheck . As far as for the fans , I'd recommend that you just do the matinée , it's not a full price ticket movie , it's just an extended episode , the ending is anti-climatic and this was just pointless .
482304	1293485	486576	5.0	Entertaining , but oh-so-cheesy and predictable	Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer , was supposed to be one of the big summer events , but over all didn't make it as huge of an impact as expected , but I was hearing pretty good things from my friends who saw it . But I wanted to wait for the rental since I really wasn't into the first one , the first one just was so silly and didn't keep my attention . I have to say that Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer was definitely better than I expected and so much better than the original Fantastic Four , but I think I will probably skip out on the next sequel , this just isn't my type of super hero story . But that's the way Marvel has always been , very cheesy and silly , but the hero's always save the day . I think also I'm having a problem since Jessica Alba is getting nothing but the " hot factor " publicity lately , so I can't help but be sarcastic during her scenes where it seems like she really can't act , no offense to her . But Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer is just glitzy effects with a fun story . The fantastic four are back and Sue and Reed are about to get married , but that is quickly interrupted when a planet eating rock is about to destroy their world . The Silver Surfer is destroying country by country and when they get ahold of him they know his surfing board is the source of his power and if put into the wrong hands , well , things could just get so much worse . But the fantastic four ban together to save the world once again . Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer is definite entertainment , a lot of special effects and a decent story , but the actors are still not that great in my opinion . I feel actually so bad because I know there are a lot of comic book fans who love this kind of story and grew up with the fantastic four , but I guess I should just stick to Batman , I prefer the darker stuff , for super hero's I always thought that yeah , they should have some cheesiness to the story , but not when it takes over the whole film , you know ? But I would recommend if you're just looking for a fun little action film , it is major eye candy , I'm talking mostly about Jessica Alba though , lol , just kidding .
482020	1293485	209095	5.0	There is nothing scarier than a rapping leprechaun !	Wow , my friends just critcized me for renting Leprechaun in the Hood . But come on , I wanted a good laugh mixed in with a few scares . I mean , despite it's non-promising Oscar material screen play , come on , this was so much fun to watch . The great thing about it , was that it didn't take itself so seriously . I'll admit it , I love the Leprechaun movies . I mean , they're so bad that they're good . They have a great amount of laughs and so does this one . I know I'm going to miss Leprechaun in Space , unfortunately I can't find it , but I'll stick with the Hood . As silly as it sounds , the plot is about these wanna be rappers who take a flute from Ice-T who stole it from the Leprechaun . The flute has magical powers to make them famous , so not only is Ice-T trying to get it back , but so is the leprechaun . With a scary scene of Warwick rapping , this was a fun movie to watch .
483037	1293485	482606	5.0	Good story , but it looses it's grip on the audience after the first hour	I couldn't tell you how excited I was to see The Strangers , from the moment I saw the trailer , I just knew this movie was a must see . Not in a long time has a trailer scared me so much , I just couldn't wait to see this movie . So I saw it tonite , opening night , I have to say that I'm a little disappointed with this movie . While it has some strong points , some very disturbing and creepy moments , the movie hits some classic cliché's that you've seen before as well as the characters you're just screaming at and calling idiots while in the audience . Now we have two good actors , Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler , but their characters lacked any good development and not to mention , if you're alone in your house and someone's making noise outside , do you walk towards the noise ? ! I'm sorry , just had to get that out , it just frustrated me in the classic cliché ' , let's split up and not give each other equal weapons . Kristen and James are a couple who have gone back to their father's place to celebrate the engagement that they were supposed to have , but Kristen said no . James feeling hurt goes out to get cigarettes for Kristen , Kristen hears some strange noises throughout the house , then discovers there is a man with a mask who is just making all sorts of bangs , breaking into the house , and destroying her phone . James comes back , they then discover there is three of these psycho's and must try to survive the night of terror that awaits them . The main problem with the movie is the major cliché's that come with it : the splitting up , the moving towards the noises , not to mention if these killers are human how is it that they appear in one scene then we cut back again to them and they're gone ? I was just also disappointed with the dialog that did exist , " because you were home " ? Are you serious ? There were some predictable moments , and the one thing that majorly made me angry , the killers took their very very very sweet time in establishing that they were any harm to these people , I mean other than with the car scene and making noises , I didn't take most of their presence seriously , I was like " are they going to do anything this time ? " . The Strangers is a disappointment , I would recommend you wait for the rental and watch it in the dark at home , it'd probably be scarier that way .
482623	1293485	240462	5.0	Just a fun family film that isn't special but worth a watch	I don't know why , but I just wanted to pick up this copy when I ran across it at the video store and figured that I have seen the first one , why not see the second one ? The first Dr . Dolittle is a pretty cute film that I enjoyed , so the second I guess wasn't a problem renting . Especially since I am an Eddie Murphy fan . Over all , I'd say that Dr . Dolittle 2 is an enjoyable family film that is a little bit judged too harshly on IMDb , it is just a fun movie . The family is now having trouble coping with Dr . Dolittle's animal psychic abilities , but he has very little time to save a forest that is about to be torn down and a bear , Archie , from going back to the circus . While he's trying to save these animals , the family misses him and wants to spend time , but it's hard when he has so much to do and so little time for these animals . There are some little funny and genuine moments that I think makes this a fun family film . There were some touching , like where Dolittle and his daughter find out that they have something very special in common and a certain terminator cameo that will get you laughing . So , I'd recommend for the family afternoon , but otherwise , be nice , it's a cute movie .
482314	1293485	117218	5.0	Sweet - N - Offensive	Well , um , I'm not sure what to say about " The Nutty Professor " . I have heard a few parodies on this movie and some have said this is a decent comedy . But for the most part , this movie broke my heart because I used to be over weight and recently dropped all the pounds , so I felt for Sherman . But I felt that the movie really over did it on the fat jokes because I know some people that exercise and do whatever they can to loose weight and it's almost impossible . So I felt that in some ways this movie was cruel and unrealistic . But it had a very sweet side and it had it's occasional jokes that could get a little laugh . So , I'd recommend over all , but then again , if you are very touchy on weight jokes , you might want to skip .
482317	1293485	257756	5.0	Despite it's promising cast , it's very vulgar and predictable and a waste of a good thriller	While the ideas were very good and interesting , there is always a " big twist " at the end , that pretty much you can easily predict by today . I've mentioned before , but I'll repeat , you've seen one good thriller , then you've seen them all . While it seemed like the director had good intentions , he tried too hard to shock the audience when really I could had written a better script . Another problem I had is that Ashley and Morgan are getting stereotyped , well Ashley more than Morgan , because they are signing onto these thrillers with the shocking ending . It gets old , they couldn't do it really after the excellent crime thriller " Kiss the Girls " . When all is said and done , you're really just looking at the case of the movie when it ends and wondering why you bothered because you knew what would happen . Like I said , the cast wasn't the main problem , it was just script writing and the director's fault . There were some things I had questioned , like Ashley's character's reactions at certain times . They didn't seem appropriate or on cue when needed . Morgan was the only actor who was true and original , he and Jim had carried the film doing the best they could with what they had . If you want a predictable thriller , I would recommend , but I mean you can really save the watch . It's just not exciting any more to see them and the script could have been written by a 15 year old that has seen one too many high action crime thrillers .
482135	1293485	110667	5.0	Sex , sex , and more sex ?	It seemed like this movie was just an excuse for a director's fantasy to come true with catholic school girls . But anyways , the movie is a little strange . I'm not sure if I enjoyed it , but I was in the mood for gory fun . So , if you are ever in that mood , then watch it .
482147	1293485	141109	6.0	It was lame and cheesy , but I think people are way to harsh on this film	I watched " Jack Frost " last night and I had my doubts because of all the bad reviews on IMDb . But I didn't think it was that bad . Yeah , it is a little cheesy , and of course very unrealistic . Sometimes that's what you need for a feel good kind of a movie . Over all , the script and acting is a little silly and this a movie more for the family by yourself . But I wouldn't mind seeing this again . It's not really that terrible . I'm serious , just give the movie a shot . Like I said , people are a little too harsh on the film when they just can't admit it makes them feel good afterwards . So , give the movie a shot . Especially around the holidays if you feel like a scrooge .
482055	1293485	109520	6.0	There are a few too many inspirational speeches and it's totally predictable , but . . .	For some odd reason , I liked D2 : The Mighty Ducks . Now , obviously , I haven't had the opportunity to see The Might Ducks , you know , the first one ? But my friend only had the second and the third , so I'm watching those first and hopefully I didn't have to see the first one to understand the second . But I got the story just fine , not to mention , after reading the summary of The Mighty Ducks , I get the point of the movie . Basically , Gordon now has the chance to coach his Mighty Ducks again , only this time , they are Team U . S . A . They are fighting against the best Pee-Wee hockey teams in the world , including the very nasty , plays against the rules , Iceland Team . Now , if you've seen The Karate Kid , you get where this is going . Of course , Gordon changes and wants to win instead of have fun , leading the team into stress , and again , if you've seen Rocky , you get the point . See what I mean by how predictable it was ? Not to mention how many inspirational speeches there were , I was getting a toothache from how many there were , they were so sweet , it was unbearable . But I thought that it was a fun family film that the kids would definitely get a kick out of . As silly as it was , it is a good film for the kids , for morals , you know ? : - D But , just sit back and enjoy , you never know , you might like it as well .
482215	1293485	443295	6.0	Actually , I had fun !	Now , granted , 2005 was not the best year for films and lately the family movies have been quite lame . But do you really think , to those who have seen the film , that this film deserves a 3 . 3 ? Come on ! Where is your sense of humor ? Also , I watched this film when I was babysitting my cousins , we were just laughing our heads off because this film had some good gags in it . Yes , it's unrealistic , but what movies are ? Some have to be a little unrealistic in order to deliver what we want . That's the point of films , they help us escape reality and just enjoy ourselves for an hour and a half . So please , give this family comedy another chance and just let go and have fun !
482750	1293485	64665	6.0	You have got to admit , it's a little over rated and dated	Please , don't be upset with me , I am in love with classic cinema . Not to mention , I am a huge fan of Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight , both are incredibly talented actors , and unfortunately not too many actors have been able to compare to them now-a-days . But for me the film just didn't work , it was just incredibly dated , you can tell by the film making , and the story just was too depressing . Although , I have to admit , I still got a few kicks out of the movie , especially now that I know where that line came from " Hey ! I'm walking here ! " . Dustin rocks ! Basically , Jon Voight plays Buck , a cowboy who has moved to New York to be a prostitute to makes ends meat , but he ends up meeting Enrico , played by Hoffman , a crippled con artist . They buddy up together to make it and have dreams , or at least more so by Enrico , to move to Florida / paradise . But things take a horrible turn when Enrico comes down with a bad fever , it really puts their friendship to the test . The first X-Rated ( by the way what's up with that rating ? ) film to be voted Best Picture , it really was interesting to watch , and I don't regret seeing it , just I felt that it was kind of dated and could have been done a little better . But it truly is Dustin who steals the movie with his killer performance .
483010	1293485	78754	6.0	Did I see this or dream it ?	I was going through my mother's movies the other day and I came across All that Jazz , I remember reading in my 1001 movies you must see before you die book , this was mentioned . I had absolutely no idea what it was about , but I noticed that Roy Scheider was in it and he's a fantastic actor , so i figured what did I have to loose ? I slipped it in and this is definitely one of the most unique movies I have ever seen . Like I said I had no clue what it was about , so I even watched it twice just to clarify things and still I was just left dumbfounded . The way this film was made is not your typical biography , it does have exciting dance sequences and a lot of trippy scenes . It's strange to say , but it's very dated by the way this film was made . Roy does a knock out performance , not his best , but it makes the film work , but I just don't think this was a film for my tastes . Joe Gideon is a choreographer who is tough , but unique . He always cooks up something good and everyone just adores him , including an endless line of women . Let's put it this way , the line of women he's had an affair with could go around the world twice . We go through his life story , how he came to be who he was . A chain smoking perfectionist who worked non-stop to get ever step and beat down . The critics start to worry that he is loosing his touch , Joe works harder than ever to prove them wrong leading him into a physical break down , but he is determined to put the greatest show on stage . Roy really makes the film worth your watch , so I felt like my time wasn't totally lost . I just couldn't get into this movie . I think it depends on your tastes , it's just made very strangely , which I did understand the direction they were going for to understand Joe's madness , but it just wasn't for me . The whole dream sequences with I think her name was Angelique were just a little off key , I know why she was apart of the story , but it was just a little too strange . I'm not sure if I could recommend this , the only thing I can say is that it is a one of a kind film that you have to be in a certain mood for .
483580	1293485	408524	6.0	I liked the original better	Since I finally remembered to rent The Bad News Bears at Hollywood Video , I decided to rent the remake instead of the sequels first , to see what the remake was all about and I thought that actually Billy Bob Thorton was a great choice for Buttermaker , so I was kinda looking forward to it . Of course , I watched the original first , so after almost dying of laughter from The Bad News Bears , this film had a lot to live up too . Unforutnatley , I don't think this film worked as well because of the dates , the 70's , films still seemed like they could push it to the edge , while into today's world , we have to be more PC . Not to mention the kids were more annoying and punky than the lovable punky kids in the original . Buttermaker is a has been baseball player and now an alcoholic , he is given the job of a little league coach for the Bears since no other fathers are taking the job . But he's definitely taken back when he finds out that the team he is coaching are kids who are , well , I guess you could say " lacking " in the department of knowing how to play baseball . But he just wants to get paid and get the job over with , but when their first game comes along , the kids get creamed 26-0 , Buttermaker is pressured to drop the team out of the league , but instead teaches the kids how to play and recruits a couple of new kids , a girl who's mother he used to date , and a rebel without a cause . The kids get better in each game , but it's a matter of Buttermaker getting his priorities straight when he lets the game get the worst of him . . . and he's an alcoholic ! Billy Bob did do a good job as the new Buttermaker , but he seemed to be the softer version than Walter , so I'd have to vote for Walter if I want the real Buttermaker . Tanner , I was incredibly disappointed with , because he just turned into an annoying brat than a fun little punk , not to mention I was ticked off that they changed the line " shove the trophies up your . . . " to the other kid , that was Tanner's line and rightfully so ! While Bad News Bears had a couple laughs , it just wasn't needed , stick with the original .
483375	1293485	443489	6.0	Pfft ! I can see why it wasn't nominated for best picture	I was excited about seeing Dreamgirls , especially after seeing the Oscar nods it got . But I still wasn't too sure about Jennifer Hudson's win , after all , before I saw this film , I saw Babel , and the Hispanic actress who was nominated I felt totally deserved the award . But how can you judge before seeing what Jennifer Hudson's raved about performance was all about . Now I have to start off with that actually this was a good film , but you know what ? It was average , nothing thrilling or original came out of it . It's your typical rise and fall story that had nothing special or had no spark . Jennifer's performance was good for a first time , but I still wasn't too thrown over it . The story is just so abused and too used by so many writers . Curtis is looking for a backup group for his famous singer , James Early . He finds the Dreamettes , three beautiful and strong black women , he also becomes involved with one of them . Slowly they rise to the top , but Effie , the girl is involved with is not exactly " thin " or that " appealing " to a younger crowd , so with her girlfriends in the group , her brother , and her new boyfriend , Curtis , they vote her out of the group and the Dreamettes become huge , but the joke is on Curtis when Effie gets a second chance . The performances were the key that got raved about most in the film , now I have to say that they were good , but honestly , it was nothing beyond good . I don't have anything against Jennifer Hudson , but I am very upset with all the publicity she is getting now for one film and an Oscar that I believe doesn't belong to her , but I know there are some that wouldn't agree with me . Eddie didn't thrill me either , I've actually seen him in better , but I have to admit the only performance I was actually , and surprisingly , impressed with was Beyonce Knowles , she has come a long way . So , I'm not sure if I would recommend this film , if you wanna watch it , go ahead , but don't expect too much .
483577	1293485	191754	6.0	It's enjoyable at times , but seems to lack as well	I just saw 28 days , and I have heard so much about this film , it's insane . I've seen it on so many IMDb user's reviews and my sister was just talking about this film a few days ago . She mentioned that Steve Buchemi was in the film , so I figured that I would give this film a shot . While 28 Days was a pretty good film , it didn't quite capture me as well as Girl , Interrupted did . I guess because it seemed like the script writers were pointing us into two directions with some different situations and the ending just seemed to well , end . Basically , Gwen is an alcoholic that unfortunately has ruined her sister's wedding and gets into a bad car accident forcing her to either go to jail or rehab , she choose rehab , but realizes that it might be too cheesy for her to handle , so after some resistance , she finally realizes that it's now or never and just deals with it , but learns that she has good friends and is finally discovering who she truly is . Well , the plot with Gwen and Eddie just seemed to point us in different directions , while Eddie in some ways helped Gwen out , I don't think his character was absolutely needed . But it was kind of a nice touch with Gwen bumping into her friend at the plant shop , in some ways it was just so realistic and touching to see that one last smile . Over all though , I could honestly say that I would recommend this movie for a watch , but don't expect Oscar material .
482573	1293485	110442	6.0	I thought there were just as many laughs and it was a decent sequel	I don't know why the harsh rating , I mean , despite the fact that a few actors were replaced , I thought that Major League 2 was a decent comedy . Separated from the first , I think more people would give it a chance . How could you not laugh at the buddist out fielder ? He was hilarious ! I liked how they showed that most of the guys changed , it was so human and added a real story . The boys are back for the next season , this time Rachel has sold the team to Roger and he is in charge . The boys have all changed though , mainly Rick , who has lost his " wild thing " edge . The boys this time want to make it to the world series , but that's going to be hard since most of them have taken their fame to their heads . Rachel buys the team back and the boys finally decide to get themselves together and get to the world series ! Major League 2 is a good comedy if you just let go of the first one , I know that most don't want to since the first was so original and a great comedy as well , but just give it a shot as it's own movie . It has some really funny moments that I loved a lot . This movie at least deserves to have a better rating than a sorry 4 .
483424	1293485	370263	6.0	Good Idea vs . Bad Idea	I'm going to start out on the good ideas . Good Idea : Putting together the two scariest aliens together in a battle and humans getting in the middle . How perfect is that ? Examples : King Kong vs . Godzilla , Freddy vs . Jason , and Dracula vs . Frankenstein . It's a plot well used , and very loved by horror fans . The ending was also very cool , which I will not spoil . You'll just have to trust me on that . The characters are pretty well developed and bringing back Lance was a interesting and exciting concept . You have the same feel from the original movies . The best part is that I think the director , he wasn't trying to upstand the original Alien and Predator movies . He knew that they could never be touched and didn't feel the ultimate need for CGI effects . Bad Idea : First off , Antarctica . This is the coldest place on Earth , 50 below zero is summer time in that country . All the explorers wore was one winter coat , and the girl takes her jacket off at the end . She would've froze to death . As along with the others , because one coat would never keep them warm enough . I know that " Alien vs . Predator " was a comic book , but the stories could never realistically be put together . " Alien " was set in the future and in space . " Predator " was set in the jungle and the creature was a man hunter . It being on the side of the humans didn't make much sense . Some very typical and predictable points in the movie were used and very stupid people . Over all , it's not a bad movie to watch , but I wouldn't really watch it again .
483108	1293485	86066	6.0	" We're doing it for Johnny ! "	I just watched once again " I love the 80's : Strikes Back " and they mentioned in ' 83 The Outsiders , I've been putting off this movie for quite a while , considering how many stars are in this film , I kept on trying to remind myself to rent it , I finally remembered ! This film in a nutshell is West Side Story without the love story , the singing , or the dancing , so in some ways if you got scarred of that , you needn't worry any more . This is an incredible cast that you would never imagine at the time would make it so far in life , like Matt Dillion , Tom Cruise , Emilio Estovez , Rob Lowe , Patrick Swaze , etc . They play " The Outsiders " , just the rebels of the town , but trouble ensues when the preps attack them and in defense one of them accidentally kills one of the preps and a huge rival happens . Over all , I'd say that it's a decent flick , it's a bit dated , but it's very intense and I'd say actually a good movie to watch . It set a bar for these actors and they might not be where they are today , they had some pretty great performances . I do love that line " We're doing it for Johnny ! " . : ) So , go ahead and grab the popcorn for this one !
482595	1293485	444682	6.0	Kind of a disappointment	I wasn't really too interested in seeing The Reaping , but it looked like it might be worth a watch , so my friend and I saw it last night and both him and I agreed , it was kinda predictable and not that entertaining . Hilary Swank is an incredible actress and this seemed to be a step down for her . While it has some creepy moments , it wasn't anything to be thrilled over , it just could haven been better or more scary . The acting was alright , the story could have been more clever , but I do have to admit the effects were pretty cool , sometimes a little hokey , but over all they did a good job on the " destruction " of the Earth . Katherine is a scientist who used to be a Christian missionary , but when she lost her husband and child to a plague , she lost her faith as well . But when a town starts to witness the reaping , the end of the world through God's wrath , they blame it on a little girl , but Katherine is sure she can prove through science that it's nothing to worry about . But she starts to find out slowly how this may not just be something to forget about and the prophecy just might be true . It's not a recommendation for the theater , it's more of a rental , I'm just warning you that it's not a movie to get thrilled over and it's a disappointment considering all the advertisement that it got . Hilary made a mistake taking this film , it wasn't creepy and it doesn't really get your mind thinking . Seriously , just wait for the rental , you'll thank me later .
483089	1293485	112883	7.0	Guienuenly a good film	My mom and I have been trying to see more Johnny Depp movies since we saw his biography , we've seen the main movies that highlighted his career , but never the little one's along the way . Don Juan DeMarco , I don't remember hearing much about it when it was released , I think it was one of those small success films . But the thing that was interesting is that so many people who compared Johnny Depp to Marlon Brando on his diverse roles and character acting methods , they finally got to work together in this movie and bonus , they had great chemistry on screen . Don Juan DeMarco isn't by any means my favorite Johnny Depp film or a great film , but it's a good one that I think had a decent story and is very watchable at least one time . Johnny and Marlon just deliver the story so well and were so charismatic on screen . Johnny truly became Don Juan DeMarco . Dr . Jack Mickler is a psychiatrist who is on his last few days before his big retirement . He meets a suicidal man who is claiming that he is the legendary Don Juan DeMarco , he is put into the hospital . He begs Jack to take the time to tell him his story and that if he can convince him that he is Don Juan , that Jack will let him go . He agrees and Don tells him his story . But Don's grandmother tells Jack a different story , is Don really Don or just some crazy guy who is desperately in love with a woman ? But Jack believes him and even becomes a Don Juan at home with his wife . Don Juan DeMarco is a cute film and is definitely worth a look . There's nothing wrong with the film , I just wasn't into it as much as I am usually thrilled with Johnny or Marlon . But I think this was one of those films they could be more relaxed with and they were already very much established as great actors , so they could do a movie like this . It didn't matter that it wasn't a box office success , it's just a cute movie that I'm sure you'll enjoy . It definitely leaves a smile on your face and makes you feel good , so I would recommend it for a fun little comedy .
483321	1293485	83530	7.0	I know that it was silly , but for some reason I enjoyed it	Now , I know that this was the same thing and same jokes as the very first Airplane . But for some reason , I think because I was just in such a good mood that day , I really did enjoy this funny sequel . True , despite it being set in the future , they used the same characters , and you could totally tell that it was still set in the 80's , it was still a fun movie to watch . The only thing I really missed was Leslie Neilson . I know this also has a lower rating than the original , but I think everyone just needs to have fun with it . Yes , it was an unnecessary sequel , but it still had a few good laughs you have to admit . They brought back all the jokes we loved , and yes , it's unoriginal , but at least it's what makes the movie work . So , I know as silly as it may sound , I think you'll get a kick out of Airplane II : The Sequel . Like I said , just have fun with it !
482291	1293485	91209	7.0	A classic thriller that still gets a few chills	I confess I saw the remake of The Hitcher before I saw the original , despite me hearing a few good reviews about it , I never really got around to seeing it . But when I saw the remake , I swore I would see the original . The remake sucked , I told my friend about it , she told me to just stick to the original , so I rented it a few days ago and watched it , I have to say that it was definitely better , it had a lot of chills and scares here and there . In my opinion , there are a few flaws here and there , like the kids are still not that likable , and some things didn't work that well , but I'd have to give spoilers to tell . Jim has been traveling for quite some time from Chicago to California , when he is trying to keep awake , he sees a hitcher that he offers a ride too . The hitcher's name is " John Ryder " and quickly threatens Jim's life , but Jim manages to get him out of the car . Right as things look good for him , we realize it's only 15 minutes into the film , and John is not going down without a fight and frames Jim for murders that he committed himself . Jim meets a young pretty waitress Nash and she tries to help him get out of this mess , but John is not going to give up that easily . The Hitcher has some very intense moments that were great , John Ryder is one of the best villains in horror movie history . The guy just won't give up on making Jim's life a living hell in the series of murders that he is leaving behind for Jim to take the blame . My problem is that he said Jim was a smart man and would figure out why he was doing this to him , but I never found out why . Oh , well , I guess maybe it was just me .
483364	1293485	167190	7.0	Actually kind of fun and adventurous	So , Hellboy , another comic book I never heard of , figured I would never get into it if I didn't know the story , so I stayed clear of the film , but I was renting movies and came across it and figured to just see what it was about . I watched Hellboy yesterday and this was definitely a fun film , it's so rare that we get the dark comic book story like Batman , except we have Hellboy , supernatural and dark , nice combo . Hellboy packs plenty of action and cool effects with an awesome story and a new anti hero to root for . It's so cool and ironic that we are rooting for a half man and half devil to save the world , right ? Hellboy is an awesome hero with the super strength , great fighting skills , and best of all , gotta love the last cool pun lines when he saves the day . In 1944 , Professor Trevor Bruttenholm goes to Germany to stop a Nazi troop who are ready to open the gates of Hell . The Americans are able to stop the troop , but Trevor finds a creature , half man , half devil , he calls him Hellboy . Years later Hellboy is being used by the government to help the city out with super natural forces . But when Grigori Rasputin wishes to open the gate once more , he needs Hellboy to do so . In the mean time , Hellboy is fighting for the city and the woman he loves , Liz , and will not fall for Grigori Rasputin's tricks . Hellboy is definitely a fun film to watch and it's a great comic book film . The only complaint I have about the film is just that the effects , as great as they were , there was still some very CGI moments and they were not believable . But I loved Abe Sapien , the special effects on him were beautiful and looked very real . I would recommend Hellboy for the comic book fans or even if you're looking for a dark super hero film other than Batman or The Crow . This is a fun movie and I'm looking forward to the sequel .
482733	1293485	83929	7.0	The Original Teen Sex Comedy	Fast Times at Ridgemont High is one of those films , even if it was made before you were born , you have heard of it in some way . It is so referenced to society and some of it's scenes are legendary . I was watching I love the 80's and they showed some pretty funny clips , so it was always on my mind to give this movie a look . I finally remembered to rent it at Hollywood Video and watched it last night . Although I'm not sure I laughed as much as others would have , I still liked this film for some reason . Just because I think in one way or another you could relate to it and remember how hard it was being a teenager . We have Stacey and Linda , two hot young high school students who are very sex deprived and look to make this year their best ever . Mike who is chasing after Stacy and looking to have a meaningful relationship with her . Brad , a senior who is looking to make his last year the best but plans turn out to be different when everything turns on him . Then of course we have Jeff Spacolli , the stoner surfer dude who manages to finally let a teacher , Mr . Hand , have his own . Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a classic teen comedy that I would highly recommend . It is all in good fun and was just so much fun to watch . The cast looked like they had so much fun and the movie just looked like a blast to make . It's understandable on why this film's legacy lives on , this was the movie to watch before American Pie and it's always a joy to stick to the original , trust me . Even though this film had it's stupid moments , I gotta admit I couldn't help but laugh at Spacolli's line " What's that noise ? " . . . " It's my skull ! " , we're proud of you , Sean .
482223	1293485	180093	7.0	It's a good movie , but not within my tastes and was a bit too dark and disturbing	My best friend has been begging me since 2001 to watch Requiem for a Dream , for some reason I never really got around to watching it . But recently I thought about the movie and decided to give it a shot . After all on IMDb , it's # 52 on the top 250 . What did I have to loose ? Well , this movie is a trip , and I mean an intense one . This is an excellent depiction of what drugs can do to you and the horrible graphic consequences of continuing the downward path . The acting , we have Ellen Byrnstein , one of the finest actresses , you might remember her from The Exorcist . I felt so awful for her character in the film , now she doesn't get on drugs intentionally , she just wants to loose some weight because she was picked to go on a TV show . So she starts taking diet pills that have the same drugs as speed in them , so unknowingly she continues taking them uncontrollably . Her son played by Jared Leto , his girlfriend Jennifer Conelly , and his friend Marlon Waynes are drug dealers and heavy users themselves , but continue their search for a dream like paradise . This is a good movie in general when it comes to effectiveness , but the best made picture ? Not really , but the acting and story is terrific . I will warn you , this is extremely graphic and should not be shown to children .
483551	1293485	83767	7.0	The movie that started one of the best TV series " Tales from the Crypt "	My mom brought home 10 D . V . D's a couple of months ago . And she gave me this movie called " Creepshow " , and said that it was cheep and she knew that I liked horror movies , so she bought it for me . And I wasn't expecting anything . I thought it would be a cheap movie that was stupid . I was in shock . I actually enjoyed Creepshow . And realized that this is what sprung up " Tales from the Crypt " With great stars that made it in life . I was happy . Not one of the best , but it will be a classic to horror fans for a life time .
483427	1293485	289848	7.0	Not as funny as " Analyze This " , but still it's a good comedy	I wasn't laughing as much as I did in the first movie . But there are some pretty funny scenes in " Analyze That " . I think I am in love with Robert DeNiro . It's official . : D Just kidding . He's just so funny in the movie . Once again he steals the show . Especially with him singing songs from " West Side Story " . The plot isn't as interesting as the fist movie of course , but they keep up with the same goofs . Over all , it's a good film . But don't expect another " Analyze This " . It's not as funny . But it's good for a couple laughs . And since I am so in love with Robert , I'm going to be nice .
482785	1293485	470705	7.0	This movie is really starting to BUG me	OK , cheesy joke , I know , but actually the movie really did get to me . I picked up this movie at Hollywood Video , I was pretty curious on what it was , if it was a thriller , horror movie , or drama , it's pretty much a mix of all . But also William Friedkin had directed the film , William isn't just the director of The Exorcist , he's an incredible director who has many works of art under his belt . So I rented Bug and watched it last night and I have to say that this was an incredibly disturbing psychological thriller that really freaked me out . I mean , these performances were absolutely amazing , most people are raving about Ashley Judd's performance , but what about Michael Shannon ? In my opinion , he had the best performance , he was so intense and he really draws you into the scene and the story . Agnes is a woman who is pretty much on her own , she lives in a cruddy little motel , has an abusive boyfriend who is out of jail and won't leave her alone , and also lost a son a while back in a grocery store . She's also a drug addict . When her friend , R . C . , brings her friend , Peter to Agnes's house , Peter and Agnes pretty much click from the get go , but when Peter tries to get away from Agnes , he confesses the reason why , that he was part of an army experiment and he's escaped . She asks him to stay anyways , that she's so lonely , and he does , but soon they have delusions of a bug infestation and start destroying each other over something that they swear they can see and is watching them . The story is so beyond intense , I couldn't believe how much this film got to me . Especially when they reveal the ultimate damage that Peter does to his own character , it sent shivers down my spine . Ashley , Michael , and Harry all brought in great performances and really made this story incredibly interesting and scary to watch . The whole ending was beautifully shot by Friedkin , I was a little disappointed with how quickly it did end , but thinking about it , I'm not sure if there could have been a better ending , but you'll have to see what I mean when you watch it . I would recommend this film , I don't think many users are understanding what it's about or are just focusing on the wrong things here , but this movie I warn you is not for the faint of heart .
481933	1293485	87363	7.0	Was it supposed to be a comedy or horror ?	I've always asked that . Maybe it's just a parody . But I did enjoy this 80's flick . You have to admit that it is pretty memorable . I loved all the characters . Even the bad guys . It's just fun and exciting to watch . You get your laughs , but at the same time , you get your chills . You do question what age gap this was meant for . I would recommend for pre teens and up . That's for sure . I do have one more question : If the animals can't eat after midnight , then when are they supposed to eat ? Even if it's 11 : 00 P . M . , still . . . isn't that after midnight ? Great movie from the 80's . Have fun with it .
482334	1293485	241527	7.0	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone	That's it ! I give up ! I surrender ! White flag ! My friends want to see the new Harry Potter that is about to be released this summer , The Order of Phoenix , but they looked at my like I just lost my head when I told them I never saw the Harry Potter films . They just said I've seen every movie yet I never saw Harry Potter ? Well , I never saw the point since I don't read the books or wasn't interested in the films , it looked like typical kid's stuff to me . But my friends said they would not take me to see the movie until I've seen the films , it's now that I realize I got myself into trouble since these movies are all 2 + hours each . I just finished the first one a couple days ago . Harry Potter lives with an extremely cruel family , but there is something different about him , he can talk to snakes and make things appear and disappear . Well , he receives a letter , he's a wizard ! Not just any wizard , he is the only wizard ever to survive the wrath of Voldemort , the most wicked wizard . Harry goes to a magical school , Hogwarts , where he learns the truth of his heroic parents and meets two other wizards , Ron and Hermione who soon become his best friends and they discover the power of the sorcerer's stone and what might happen if it's put into the wrong hands . Harry Potter I have to admit is off to a good start with me , it had wonderful and magical effects that anyone could enjoy . The actors were just so perfectly cast , Maggie Smith , Alan Rickman , John Cleese , we have some of England's most brilliant actors . It's a well made film , now I still haven't read the books , so I can't base this film on a comparison . Even if I did , this is the movie and the movie itself is a magical and enchanting experience . Well , I'm onto The Chamber of Secrets , wish me luck .
483384	1293485	486822	7.0	A new introduction of a terrific story	The first time I saw this preview , the first thought that came into my head was " Oh , my God , how could they rip off Rear Window ? " , Rear Window is one of my all time favorite movies . But my boyfriend and I had nothing better to do last week and decided to see it , I have to say that actually , it wasn't as bad as I expected , I have to admit that it was a pretty good re-introduction to one of the greatest thrillers of all time . It had a new and fresh feeling with teens and it worked , despite how it seemed a bit more predictable than Rear Window , it still was pretty clever . Kale has had a rough year , while driving his father back from their father / son fishing trip , they get into a horrible fatal car accident , the Father dies , but Kale is alive trying to deal with the guilt of what happened . But a teacher pushes him too far in his high school Spanish class and he hits the teacher , putting him on house arrest , he cannot leave outside his property . But he's in luck when a hot young girl moves next door , they quickly develop a peeping tom type of relationship , they spy on the neighbors , but when they see the neighbor across the street on a date , but the date " never leaves the house " and they want to prove him as a cold hearted murderer , but is he ? You'll have to see this movie to find out . So Distubia was a pretty good movie , I would recommend it , although before you see it , I would highly recommend seeing Rear Window , but this was a good updated version that I'm sure you'll enjoy . It keeps you on the edge of your seat and will make you ask questions over and over again , those are always the thrillers that are worth seeing .
481943	1293485	117071	7.0	Under rated	Over all , I thought that " Moll Flanders " was a good movie . It is a little slow moving . That's the only complaint though . The story revolves around Moll Flanders . She's a slave whom goes into prostitution . And one of her customers happens to fall in love with her . They also have a child together . The movie is just about her life . But it's very heart warming , and I think any woman would enjoy it . If you enjoy Morgan Freeman or Robin Write , this is one of their best performances . I'm a little surprised with the rating . But , I guess you can't win them all . I would recommend " Moll Flanders " .
483426	1293485	250494	7.0	Think pink !	I was surprised . I honestly thought that " Legally Blonde " was going to be a dumb movie . I mean , I liked " Clueless " . But I was a teenager , and didn't care too much about meaningful movies . Today , I like drama's more than comedies . But sometimes , you have to let that go and just have fun with a movie . " Legally Blonde " is a cute movie . Reese Witherspoon is such a sweetheart . And it looked like the cast had a lot of fun with the film . Normally , I'm not into chick flicks , but I would recommend it . Like I said , just let go . Have some fun and remember to think pink !
482489	1293485	89670	7.0	I wondered whatever happened to Jack ? :	OK , was this the best Vacation sequel ? No , not really . But it still had a great amount of a laughter . I can't believe that some people really didn't like this film . Don't you have moments where you just want to sit down and laugh ? Don't think , just laugh and have a good time with the film ? The Griswalds are back and they are in Europe ! They have won an excellent trip to London , Paris , Germany ( they don't state where ) , and Rome . Of course they do manage to get into trouble , otherwise it wouldn't be a comedy . Clark still has the " father-knows-best " policy and becomes more obsessed with having a good time with the family than listening to them and their ideas . Ellen has become a famous naked model in Europe because of some undeleted footage that was stolen from Clark on his camera . Rusty is opting for a lot of booty in Europe and Audrey just won't shut up about a not all that boyfriend , Jack . This movie has non-stop laughter that you have to admit is catchy . They did recycle some jokes from the first , but I think you need to let go and have some fun . This was an enjoyable film .
483035	1293485	427309	8.0	Denzel Washington : An Actor's Director	I admit it , I'm such a lover of the over cheesy rubbing the message in your face movies , The Great Debaters was of course going to be no exception . It also won the golden globe for best drama of 2007 and I couldn't wait to see how Denzel does in the director's chair . I rented The Great Debaters and watched it the other day and the main thing about this movie that makes it great is the acting . I mean the story is fantastic , but it couldn't have been told any better because of the three young actors in this movie : Nate Parker , Jurnee Smollett , and Denzel Whitaker . We also have stellar performances from Denzel and Forrest as well of course , but it's just these three young actors that I have never seen before or heard of that just blew me away . They presented themselves with class , intelligence , and courage to carry on in the tough world they lived in . Henry , Samantha , and James are three young black students who have joined a debate team led by Melvin Tolson . They all live in Texas and have to deal with the harsh world of racism , where black people are lynched without knowledge of what they did that was so wrong . But the team pulls in strong together to win several debates despite their color and the ignorance that surrounds them , eventually leading them into competing against Harvard University . The Great Debaters is just a terrific movie , it's very inspirational and makes you think . Denzel as a director , he could be a little more visionary in my opinion , but he makes a great actor's director because he just delivers all the actor's best . Denzel Whitaker's last debate against Harvard brought me to tears , the honesty that just comes from his words makes you want to stand up and clap after his speech . I would very much recommend The Great Debaters , it is worth the watch and I'm sure will have you cheering at the end .
482744	1293485	180073	8.0	I don't know whether I loved or hated this film	I was caught in the middle of this . I just didn't know what to say . But " Quills " is a wonderful film . It was brilliantly made , and the acting was great . I will not doubt that this film was made very well . SPOILERSGeffory Rush's character is a mad author in an insane asylum . He writes very naughty stories . But a certain nurse maid , Kate Winslet , is intrigued with them . The stories get out . Of course they are burned at once for it's content . But things get more out of hand when Geffory writes a story about the doctor of the asylum and his young wife . Geffory is stripped of everything he can write with . But he refuses to stop there . I don't want to give away all . You'll just have to see for yourself .
482590	1293485	364725	8.0	Like chocolate cake : you know it's bad for you , but you can't help but love it	Silly metaphor , I know . The film " Dodgeball : A true underdog story " while maybe be offensive at times , the film really brings it back up to place with the humor . You really can't help but laugh at the movie a couple times . Sort of like " Zoolander " , another great flick with Ben Stiller , it's so stupid you've gotta love it . I would recommend this film for a good laugh . As of movie of the year or comedy of the year , no , this is not the film . But it was a good one to watch . A true film for any Ben Stiller fan , that's for sure . I will warn though , if you get offended easily , this maybe not the film for you .
483356	1293485	86927	8.0	So funny , one of my new favorite comedies !	I have heard of Bachelor Party a couple times , once on VH1's I love the 80's and also in Clerks 2 there was a small reference . The weird thing is , I'm more used to a dramatic Tom Hanks , other than Big and A League of Their Own , I've never seen him in a raw comedy movie , so it was a little weird to think of Tom Hanks as this very funny male lead in a movie . But I decided to go ahead and give the movie a look , I have to tell you , I haven't laughed so hard and so out loud in a movie like this in a long time . Then I check out the rating on IMDb , 5 . 7 ? ! Are you kidding me ? ! This movie is just so beyond funny , I know that it is cliché'd eighties , but come on ! I just couldn't believe that anyone else would not find this to be a funny film . If you're telling me you did not find Brad to be funny , you have got to get your funny bone checked because Bachelor Party is non stop laughs from beginning to end . Rick is about to get married to beautiful Debbie , his friends who live to party are throwing him the biggest bachelor party they can have . Debbie's rich and snobby family definitely don't want Rick to be apart of their lives , so Debbie's dad will do anything , including her ex-boyfriend , Cole , who wants her back , to split them up . But the bachelor party night has arrived , and things are going more crazy than the boys have expected . Bachelor Party is seriously funny , it's predictable and silly , especially the end , but it's all in good fun . This is perfect 80's humor , it's the humor I miss and I'm sure others do too , because it's raunchy but doesn't over do it and just has fun with the audience . This cast looked like they had an ultimate blast and Tom Hanks was just brilliant , his character could be a jerk , but such a great guy at the same time , so he's real and likable . This is just a funny movie that I would recommend , it's a lot of fun and the rating on IMDb is just too harsh . Come on , let's get this rating up .
482359	1293485	67116	8.0	A gritty hard cop drama that is surprisingly effective	I have heard so much about The French Connection , in my film class a couple years ago , we watched the exciting car chase scene that made this movie so famous . I just thought of the film again and decided to rent it . I watched it this morning and I have to say that William Friedkin is definitely a terrific director , he caught the mood and setting of 1970's New York and crime perfectly , so it wasn't a shock to learn that this was the 1971 best picture . This is a definite treasure when it comes to film history and is very memorable . Doyle and Russo are cop partners , it's very strange how opposite they are . Russo is pretty straight by the book and clean while Doyle is a grumpy alcoholic but does get his job done . Together they are about to stop the crime of the decade when they find out about a drug smuggle coming from France . Going through so many people to find out what will happen and when , they go through the most extreme times to bust the case . Well , The French Connection is a terrific film that is a must see for film fanatics . Or if you are just looking for a good movie to watch , this was a great one from the 70's . The car chase scene was very excellent , I think not too many people give this movie enough credit on how it was shot and made . William and the cast were just terrific , The French Connection was a very cool film .
482865	1293485	417148	8.0	I can't believe it ! This movie was so entertaining !	I remember laughing at my mom because she and my sister came home and told me about the trailer of " Snakes on a Plane " , I was like " Who the heck would name a movie ' Snakes on a Plane ' ? " . But they did ! I was laughing even more to see Samuel L . Jackson in this movie , I thought for a minute that he had lost his mind , being such an amazing actor , was his career that desperate ? The trailer just made this movie look sillier and sillier , I just couldn't believe a movie like this was being made , but my mom and I rented it today for fun and we actually had a blast watching it ! After witnessing a mafia murder , the man has to travel to LA from Honalulu with an FBI agent . However , the mafia leader decides to destroy the witness on the plane before he and the other passengers land by planting hundreds of poisoness snakes in the flowers on the plane ! When the snakes break free , they have a party going on ! They are attacking all the passengers in the coolest deaths ever ! And now the FBI agent along with the other passengers must try to land this snake pit before all the passengers die of snake poison . Snakes on a Plane is sheer entertainment and nothing more , as unrealistic as the situations are , you have to admit that it was just a blast watching this film ! The deaths were just so awesome , I think my favorite was the man going to the bathroom and well . . . you have just got to see it ! I would highly recommend Snakes on a Plane for fun ! It was an awesome entertaining movie with cool effects and chilling scares , you won't be disappointed !
482490	1293485	404032	8.0	Facts or Possibilities ?	This is by far one of the best thrillers of 2005 . I'm not sure what people didn't like , what were expecting ? A jump out of your seat horror flick ? There's something I've been thinking about because in my sociology class , we are discussing fear and what causes it . Someone brought up " The Exorcist " and asked why it's so scary . I think I can answer that and why it's the same way with this movie . Faith , it's one of the strongest things a person can hold to themselves . It's the one thing in this world we have that can hold our last hope . The fact of something unworldly taking over our body and soul is terrifying . What would happen to us ? Many people , faith was a lot stronger I believe in the 70's , had their faith shaken up by " The Exorcist " . Because no one wants to believe that something like this could happen . I could go on and on about this , I have a 7 page paper on it , but I won't . The movie itself is a great one . The acting is absolutely terrific , especially by Jennifer Carpenter and Laura Linney . You get into the mood of the whole flick and freak out more than once . You will get a couple of jumps out of this movie . But don't expect a big horror picture , you'll be disappointed . Trust me , this is a good movie of drama , suspense , and horror . Please , have an open mind . Why would some people not like this movie ?
481964	1293485	366548	8.0	Footloose , Penguin Style !	When Happy Feet took the Oscar for best animated film of 2006 , I became extremely interested in seeing this movie . But I kept on hearing that this didn't deserve the Oscar , so I was a little scarred about seeing it , but I figured , everyone has a different opinion of what deserves what award and such . So I rented it anyways and I watched it last night , I have to say that this was such an adorable film and so much fun , why all the mean reviews ? It had great animation , fun songs , and an adorable story that I'm sure anyone could enjoy . On the Emporer Penguins Island , they are known for singing , not only that , but they are terrific at it , but when Mumble is born , he's a bit different , instead of being a singer , he's more of a dancer . But no one is buying it , in fact he is even sent away from the island , but he meets several penguins who are also outcasts . But there is also a bigger problem , the fish population is winding down when humans keep taking them , the penguins are starving and Mumble will try to use his tap dancing skills to communicate and save the island that has isolated him away from his friends and family . Happy Feet is all in good fun , I think people really should give it another chance . Out of Cars and Monster House , I would pick this for the Oscar , but I guess I might be alone on that one . But like I said , everyone has a different opinion , but I think if you just give this movie a shot , you'll find yourself laughing and having a great time . It's a great family film , I loved the animations , the story , and the songs , they were just terrific .
483685	1293485	109686	8.0	Jim Carrey at his best	I love Jim Carrey . He is honestly one of my favorite comedic actors . And I heard so much about this movie , that I just had to see it , and I laughed up a storm . Every joke in this movie gets a giggle at the minimum . I would recommend this if you enjoyed " Liar Liar " .
483516	1293485	90756	8.0	Very odd , but intriguing	Before Little Children , before American Beauty , there was Blue Velvet , and American masterpiece of it's time . I came across this movie a couple years ago , but I wasn't too sure about it , but it was recommended in my 1001 movies you must see before you die book . Not to mention that I like Dennis Hopper , so when I noticed that he was in this movie , I got a little more excited to pick it up . In some ways I'm glad I waited to see Blue Velvet , just because I don't think I could have appreciated it like I do since I'm a little older . While I do think it's a bit over rated than what I was led on to believe ; this was still a very memorizing film with incredible performances . The story is so dark and disturbing , just proving that the most perfect little town has it's very dark and scary secrets . Jeffrey has come home to his very sweet little home where it is on the bound of leave it to beaver style of families and friends . But unfortunately , his father had a heart attack and is in the hospital , so Jeffrey is left on his own , while he's walking home from the hospital , he comes across a disembodied human ear , brings it to the local detective . He meets the detective's daughter , Sandy , and together they think they can solve this crime . It leads them to a woman , Dorothy , who is a singer , and makes Jeffrey into her lover , but he learns that a messed up druggie , Frank , has her in a deep hold of dark secrets and leads him into a life that he never expected . Blue Velvet was the silent success of 1986 , not to mention a first of it's kind for movies . It was kinda like one of those " look closer " films , that was pretty rare for it's time . If you enjoyed American Beauty or Little Children , I would highly recommend this movie without hesitation . The acting and whole look of the story was so memorizing . The only thing was that the story did work , but it still had an empty feeling at the end for me . I just felt like it could have had a better introduction . But over all the film picked up and this is a good one , folks .
483178	1293485	66999	8.0	I was very " lucky " to watch such a great flick !	What can you say about Dirty Harry that hasn't already been said ? This is a very cool movie and without a doubt my favorite Clint Eastwood character . He is just such a cool good / bad cop , you gotta love him . Especially those famous words " You gotta ask yourself one question : Do I feel lucky ? Well , do you , punk ? " . What a great line ! What great deliverance as well ! Dirty Harry was the movie before any famous cop flicks came out really , and it was interesting to see from a cop's point of view on the emotions that run through his head when he captures a filthy criminal and they go free . The whole movie you just root for his character and hope that good will always triumph . This is a terrific film and essential to the 70's !
483009	1293485	864761	8.0	A great period piece , Kiera pulls in a fantastic performance	I couldn't wait for The Duchess , I am just a huge fan of period pieces and Kiera Knightly is becoming a fantastic actress in this genre . I was looking forward to this film mainly because I studied Georgina a little bit in college for my history class and I always thought she was such an elegant and strong woman that stood out from the others . She was like the Madonna of her day , she had a great sense of style , self , and strength . While the movie is not completely accurate , it still was a fine movie to watch . Kiera truly held her own as Georgina and was absolutely stunning . One of the underlining stories that I appreciate in this film is the battle of the sexes . Ralph Fiennes who plays the Duke of Devonshire does a fantastic job as well and he plays this anti-villain , shows the true side of the pain and pressure men felt but how they looked at women as nothing but property . This story truly touches you and makes you grateful for our present day . Georgina is born into a high class family of royalty who is about to be married off to the Duke of Devonshire and everything seems great , G is going to live the high life of class , culture , and being a lady of the people . She comes across the price though : her husband's affairs that are practically rubbed in her face , her life is constantly watched and judged by people , she must be perfect at all times to keep up her reputation as a joyful lady , she is forced to be the mother of the duke's child from an affair he had , as well as she cannot birth a son for the Duke and he will find every opportunity to rub it in her face . All this and Georgina has found another love who she cannot give her heart to fully for the love of her children and people . The Duchess is a fine film that I truly enjoyed . I wouldn't be surprised if Kiera was nominated for best actress during the academy season . I would highly recommend this movie , especially for the period piece lovers . Like I said , this film makes you appreciate what we have today in our modern society and truly makes you feel for the pressures both men and women had to face in that day . Georgina is a figure that I think is very looked over in history when she is one of the strongest presences in England's history . The Duchess , even though not entirely accurate , does a very good job of telling her story and was a pleasure to watch .
482874	1293485	45793	8.0	Another Best Picture Classic	I have a little confession that I simply need to say , I rented a TV show by accident over at the video store and didn't realize until I got home , I went back and said that it was a broken DVD and exchanged the DVD for this movie , WHEW ! That felt so good ! Gosh , I felt like I was going to burn in H-E-double hockey sticks for that if I didn't get that out . : D Sorry , I just always talk about in the first paragraph how I came across the movie , so that's the story . But anywho , I just finished From Here to Eternity , the timeless classic that was before An Officer and a Gentleman and I have to say that I really did enjoy this movie . A private , played by Cliff , is brutally treated badly by his army crew since he refuses to fight , boxing , for them . He falls in love with this hired lady to entertain the army men and she falls for him , finding herself in jeopardy of her job with an AWOL private who is now on the run for murder ! Also , the second in command chief is falling for the captain's distressed wife and they have a very steamy affair that they find themselves getting deeper and deeper into trouble with . From Here to Eternity was such a great film for the simple fact of how honest it was . I was thinking about film classics today when a friend and I were discussing it and I mentioned how they are so different from today's films , they seem so acted , but not over done , and they were never ashamed . They did the best they could and these films were made to be good , not to make money or get famous . That's what makes From Here to Eternity a great film to watch , we need more films like this today !
482815	1293485	167404	9.0	A surprisingly good ghost story	I remember this coming into theaters , and my sister telling me that it scared the crap out of her . So , I figured I'd see it . I didn't know what to expect . But I was shocked , this was a very clever ghost story . With a surprising ending . I won't spoil that though , it's too good to spoil .
483484	1293485	65421	9.0	Everybody wants to be a cat !	AristoCats is such a terrific Disney classic that I just loved so much as a kid . Still to this day I can't resist watching it , it's just such a wonderful and charming film with great animation and lovely songs . I really miss the animation films like AristoCats , they had perfect voices not to mention the hand drawn animation that makes it perfect for the family . AristoCats is also very witty and clever , the story was just so wonderful . This film is just beyond irresistible , I think the most memorable moment for me was the cats playing the piano learning the appecio's , lol , it was just so cute with the piano playing and painting . Douchess and her kittens are very pampered in their huge mansion , mainly because their lady is very rich and treats them like they were her children . But when the lady feels it's time to make her will , she leaves everything to the cats and not to her butler . The butler gets angry and takes the kittens on the road and abondons them in the middle of no where . Douchess and the kittens wake up and with the help of a smooth street cat by the name of Thomas O'Malley , they head back home to their lady , but learn the coolness of being a skat cat . The AristoCats is just a perfect Disney movie that I feel is a bit over looked . I would always highly recommend this movie for kids or families , it could be enjoyed by anyone . The songs and story is just memorable . I will always join in for the movies best song " Everybody wants to be a cat " , such a great tune . I also love those dogs that guarded the farm where the cats were abandoned , they were just so cute . This is a terrific film , please watch it , you won't be disappointed .
483213	1293485	82971	9.0	Ah , back when adventure films were fun to watch	Don't you just love Indiana ? Men want to be him , women want to be with him . He's just so darn lovable . Mr . Speilberg is a genous . He can't create a movie without a certain amount of perfection . With his great Indiana Jones trilogy that no one can touch , he's undefeatable . I just wish they could make movies like this again .
483298	1293485	110005	9.0	Kate's Big Break	I am a huge fan of Kate Winslet , she is my favorite actress of all time , simply because she is possibly the most honest . It seems like she has the most natural talent and when she has a role she embraces it , recently I had a message from a IMDb user who asked me if I saw this film and if I hadn't , I should due to the fact that Kate was amazing in it . I also noticed it in my " 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die " book , so I had passed it over at Hollywood Video and figured to give it a look . I noticed also that it was directed by Peter Jackson who is now more famous due to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy , but I thought this film was really over looked and one of his finest . It's incredibly unique , artistic , and disturbing in some ways . Pauline is a out cast at school and she meets the new girl , Juliet , together they find out that they have a major thing in common , a wile imagination . They want to write a story together , they go as far as to call each other by their story names and spend time with each other constantly . But the parent's concerns grow more and more as the girls become a little more . . . " obsessive " of each other . Juliet's parents wish to send to her Africa to live with her aunt , but Juliet and Pauline do not want to let go of each other , and Pauline sees only one obstacle keeping them from seeing each other , her mom . So they devise an evil plan to get rid of her mom , permanently . Heavenly Creatures was incredibly unique and an amazing film . I couldn't believe my eyes watching this film , it was so interesting to watch , especially being in these girl's minds and imagination . Kate and Melanie had great chemistry and Peter Jackson made this film into his own . I would recommend it for movie buffs and definitely if you want to see how Kate got her start , she was amazing .
483490	1293485	117442	9.0	A very good story about the " mad monk "	I have to say that I was very impressed with the story of Rasputin . It was very accurate . Allen Rickman was amazing in the story . He is such an incredable and under rated actor . The whole story is great if you like to stick to accurate history . I wasn't too sure about the love story between the wife and Rasputin , they were mostly rumors . So , I didn't think it was necessary to add into the movie . " Rasputin " is a great movie to watch . I would highly recommend if you are into history . Especially Russian history or into the World Wars . Trust me , it will not disappoint you .
483448	1293485	79817	9.0	Makes you want to go the distance and hit someone :	Rocky II is the second installment in the Rocky series . One of my friends told me that I have to see the Rocky movies because they are very good and every movie fan should just see them . I'm also just interested in seeing what the hype was about . I actually was very surprised on how much I enjoyed the first Rocky . It had entertainment and was very inspirational . Rocky II dove a little more into what Rocky himself is all about . Obviously , from the first Rocky movie , he was just a punk off the streets who just got " lucky " according to Apollo , his competitor . In Rocky II , he and Apollo decide they want a rematch to see who is the real winner and fighter of the world since it was a draw match from the first Rocky . Also , Rocky marries Adrien and has a son with her . I did enjoy Rocky II , and I'm very much looking forward to the third one . I heard Mr . T is the star ! :
482121	1293485	80339	9.0	Before " Scary Movie 3 " there was " Airplane ! "	I saw " Scary Movie 3 " , and a lot of people told me that some of the jokes were like " Airplane " . So , I figured I'd give it a shot . I was laughing on the floors . I couldn't believe what " Airplane ! " got away with . The jokes were very crude , I mean before there was " Scary Movie " or " Not Another Teen Movie " , there was " Airplane " . I didn't think that really crude jokes came ' till " American Pie " and " There's something about Mary " . I enjoyed " Airplane " . It's a first of it's kind , and a laugh fest . Leslie Nielson was histerical . And there were a lot of familular faces I noticed in the film . Which was also a lot of fun . I would recommend it . If you enjoyed these movies I mentioned , you'd love " Airplane ! " .
483214	1293485	85794	9.0	Robert De Niro just keeps getting better and better	Now , I don't think it's Scorsese's best . But it is one of the finest . It's a very unique plot about how far you would go to make in show biz . Martin is a king of directing , as Robert is a king of acting , do you want me to go on ?
482432	1293485	120737	9.0	An epic triumph	What a good movie ! I have seen both this and the two towers in the theater , and may I say that that it is a one of a kind experience . My mom said that Star Wars was the best she saw in the theater . And I guess Lord of the Rings is our generation's Star Wars . It's impossible not to see this movie . You have to watch it . Otherwise , you're missing out on a wonderous movie . The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring
483141	1293485	95705	10.0	One of the funniest movies . . . ever !	I usually like to rent movies at least twice a month . The only catch is that I don't like taking my friends , because I like to read and I know this sounds silly , but concentrate on the movies that I'd like to see . Just because I don't like to see movies that I know will be bad . But my friends and I were out and I mentioned how I was going to rent movies that night . They asked if they could come , and I couldn't say " no " . That would just be horrible to say , and especially with my silly theory . I saw " Naked Gun " sitting there , and my friend asked me if I ever saw this movie , and I said " no " . She said that this would be the movie to watch for a good laugh . So , I decided for once to let go and rent . I was glad that I did . This is by far one of the funniest movies I have seen . You can't take it seriously , but that's what I love about it . It's a great movie . I would recommend it for comedy lovers .
482088	1293485	400717	10.0	Are you kidding me ? ! 5 . 5 ? ! I had so much fun watching Open Season !	I was very much looking forward to seeing Open Season on it's first weekend , but I was a bit worried when I saw only a 5 . 5 on IMDb , because normally , most of the users are right about these movies . But my friends and I still wanted to see this fun looking picture , so we saw it tonight and may I say that I am surprised by you IMDb users who didn't like this film , everyone is entitled to an opinion , I agree . But seriously , how could you not like this film ? It has amazing animation , fun characters , and hilarious jokes for kids as well as adults ! After a bear , Boog , saves a deer , Elliot , from becoming another trophy for an evil hunter , Shaw , they become instant friends . But since Boog is a pampered bear , Elliot wants in on the room service , but ends up getting Boog in some trouble and back into the woods , together they decide to get back to civilization , trying their best to avoid open season from other hunters as well as getting away from Shaw . My favorite character is the porcupine , he was just so cute , " Buddy ! " . Especially , the scene where the dame explodes causing a huge wave of water to splash over the woods destroying everything and moving all the animals away from their safe place and the porcupine sees Boog and Elliot and just smiles and happily screams " Buddy ! " while getting swooped up into the wave as well ! It was so funny ! Seriously , people , learn to have some fun , I know this was a kid's movie , but my friends and I had a great time watching this movie . This is one of the best movies I have seen of 2006 , hopefully , the rating will go up . To those who loved this movie , thank you for having a good sense of humor , to those who didn't like the movie , just give it another shot , please ! :
482405	1293485	105046	10.0	Very good	" Of Mice and Men " is one of my all time favorite books . I read it in high school and it was the first book I had a major interest in and read again and again after we finished it . The friendship of Lennie and George is so strong and inspiring . I think that's a reason I loved it , because my best friend and I could relate . We'd do anything for each other just like George would do for Lennie . The performances are jaw dropping good and I loved Gary Senise as George and John Malkovich as Lennie . You know that they started out in the Chicago theaters together first ? Sorry , my Chicago pride slips in sometimes . John does something a little different with Lennie from the original black and white version and gives him more of a disgruntled voice with a lisp that sounds close to a child's . In some ways that was a good idea , because Lennie thinks like a child in some ways . But it wasn't that needed , Lennie was just a mentally challenged man , not speeched impaired . The plot is that Lennie and George are always on the run . Lennie always gets George in trouble because Lennie just doesn't know any better . Even though Lennie doesn't give George a break on life , you can tell he cares for him deeply and takes care of him . They go to a farm that is owned by Curly , played by Casey Siemaszko , to work for money and a place to live . They make friends with an elderly man , Candy who isn't well respected . He has an old dog with him that everyone is telling him to shoot because he's getting to old , and this was symbolic of what Candy was feeling , like just because the dog's old and useless , they should just get rid of him . When George , Lennie , and Candy are talking one night they talk about their dreams of going away to a potato field with rabbits for Lennie . This is it , they are going to go live their dreams . But when a flirty girl who happens to be Curly's wife keeps on going around the boys , she happens go to Lennie next where something terrible happens leading Lennie and George on the run again to an extremely powerful ending . This is a great movie and should be shown to everyone . I'm very serious on that because it has such a powerful message of strong friendship and loyalty . There are great performances and a great setting . I think John Steinbeck would be proud !
483023	1293485	52357	10.0	Incredible effects for it's time , I was impressed !	I was curious to see all of the Alfred Hitchock films , especially his famous one's . Because they are so well used in parodies and are very inspired by many up coming directors of today . Alfred has really never disappointed film appreciators , he was a master of his picture . He brings us a dazzling and well acted picture " Vertigo " . Probably his second most famous picture , it's about a detective , John / Scottie ( as his acquaintances call him ) , he has a fear of heights . When a man asks him to look out for his wife because he feels that she is in danger , John falls for her in the process . But when she " commits suicide " off of a tall tower , he feels there is no reason to go on . Except when a year later he meets a " look a like " . I won't give away any more because this ending is a shocking and great one ! You won't want to miss this incredible picture !
482248	1293485	109506	10.0	A very dark , beautiful , powerful film	I was about 9 when I saw this in 1994 , and I loved it already . And as I grew up and watched this film more and more I understood it better . It's very beautiful yet dark film about death and justice for victims . And when you watch it , there can be no way no one could hate this movie . They may not understand . Or maybe this wasn't their kind of movie . I think this was the first movie that I could look at the violence as if it were justified . Because if I could honestly say I'd do the same thing if I were in the same situation . I can't help but cry at the end . It's very powerful . And moving . Brandon Lee's death , has to be the most disturbing fact of the movie . But I think he would look at this film today and be proud of his work . His performance is wonderful , his best , and devided him from his father's shadow . This a wonderful movie . Not a movie that you should watch with your kids . Unless you don't mind violence and sadistic , sick people . But if you watch it , believe me , you will not be disappointed . R . I . P Brandon Lee 1965 -

481972	1293485	454921	10.0	I'm still wiping the tears from my eyes	I was so hesitant to see The Pursuit of Happiness for one reason , this movie looked like an incredible tear jerker , just from the trailer I was nearly crying . But my friend and I had been hearing incredible reviews about this movie , so we decided to suck it up and see the movie today and we were just blown away by how amazing Will Smith's performance was . He and his son were just so incredibly heart warming and really reminded you of the important things in life . I was so touched by Chris's story , he was so determined , this movie makes you wanna go out and achieve your dreams and to never let anyone tell you what is right and what is wrong , what you can and cannot do . Chris Gardner is a struggling salesmen trying just to make the rent , buy food , and take the best care of his son that he possibly can . When his wife leaves him and his son to go get a better life , Chris is left on his own , but he wins an internship at a stocks broker company that is very competitive . Against incredible odds , he just pulls through the ultimate lows of life and keeps his head up with his son by his side . They become homeless , living in hotels , homeless shelters , and even a cruddy subway bathroom ! But Chris holds on to his ultimate dream of being happy and giving him and his son the life they truly deserve . This movie in every way possible is perfect , it was so brilliantly made and just so inspiring . Will Smith better be nominated for an Oscar next month ! This was an incredible performance and his son was just so cute , I guess talent really does run in his family . : ) I would highly recommend The Pursuit of Happiness this year ! It was a beautiful film that makes you feel like you can achieve anything you truly put you heart too , I just wish I brought more tissues !
482682	1293485	113820	10.0	Brings back so many memories	1994 was the year of the Might Morphin Power Rangers , I was only 9 years old and was such a huge fan . I remember the summer of 1995 my friends and our parents took us to see The Might Morphin Power Rangers : The Movie and we thought it was the greatest movie ever made . I know that's sad , but we loved the show and the movie lived up to a great episode with an even better budget . I hadn't seen the movie since ' 95 , but my boyfriend and I went to Target and found this movie on the $5 . 50 shelf and I grabbed it for old times sake since he was also a Power Rangers fan when he was a kid . We watched it and I have to say that despite how bad it is and how mega cheesy the lines and acting are , Mighty Morphin Power Rangers : The Movie is what it is . It was aimed at kids and was terrific for them , the story was so bad that it was actually good . The rangers are living their lives in the fast lane , they're sky diving and roller blading , I mean is there anything they can't do ? But anyways , all that is put on pause when Zordon warns the rangers of Rita and Zed's evil plan to raise Ivan Ooze . Ivan is planning to take over the world when he shrinks Rita and Zed and is putting all the kids parents under a powerful spell to make them do his bidding . Ivan then visits the command center and destroys it leaving Zordon in bad shape and now the rangers have to save the world on top of saving Zordon and become the powerful ninjas to regain their powers and defeat Ooze . Mighty Morphin Power Rangers : The Movie is extremely silly and cheesy , but I don't know what people were expecting when they watched it that it got such a bad rating . It's one of those movies that is so bad that it's actually good . Although Zordon's face will haunt my dreams for a long time , it was classic the way the " actors " who played the rangers presented their lines , I loved how they would fight and do back flips , yet could say their lines perfectly without sounding out of breath . Also how they replaced certain rangers with people who looked like they were picked out of a kick ball team line . But Mighty Morphin Power Rangers : The Movie is a classic film I think in a sense and will be a true time capsule of
482491	1293485	430105	10.0	Terrific movie for action lovers	I was absolutely impressed with " Four Brothers " . What a great film that I've been needing after a few disappointments over the summer . I finally saw " Four Brothers " after everyone told me that it was a great movie . Trust me , it lives up to the hype . The drama is there , the action , and humor . Mark Wahlberg has come such a long way from the Calvin Kline Ad's . He's become a great actor along with a great cast , they all created an entertaining flick . If you loved Four Brothers , I would highly recommend The Boondock Saints . I'm sorry this comment couldn't be more , but all I can say is that this is a good movie and should be seen by every action lover .
482686	1293485	461770	10.0	I loved Enchanted !	I first saw the trailer for Enchanted in the spring , from the moment it ended , I knew this was a movie that I wanted to see . I finally saw it today and it's everything that I hoped for and more . It was nice to finally see a Disney movie that wasn't computer animated , the beginning was almost a forgotten memory of the old fashion animation that I miss so much . But Enchanted is without a doubt one of the most fun films of the year and so perfect for the whole family . I though the plot was so extremely clever , what if the cartoons with the fairytale stories met into today's world ? Especially in New York City ? The cast just looked like they had the ultimate blast making this movie and really brought it to life . They each held their own and were a perfect choice for the comedic role they had to play . Enchanted is a clever twist on the classic fairy tale . Giselle has just met the prince of her dreams , he's saved her from a troll and asked for her hand in marriage , everything seems to be going good for them . But Prince Edward's step mother has other plans in mind when she doesn't want to give up her crown and let Giselle take it . So she sends Giselle to another world , one where there is no " happily ever after " , cut to New York City 2007 . She's in human form and needs to get back to her land , she meets a man Robert and his daughter , Morgan , she stays with them and ends up falling for Robert . Just in time since Prince Edward throws himself to the other dimension to save her , but it's definitely a life changing experience for both of them , especially when the queen arrives to take care of Giselle herself . Enchanted is one of the year's best movies and one of Disney's best , I guarantee it'll be a true classic down the line . The whole story was charming as well as funny and just a great time to watch , I don't know if I could pick a favorite part , there were so many to choose from , but I think the part where the prince first arrives to New York , how determined he is , he even takes on the city bus because he thinks it's a beast . For me , I think James Mardson stole the film as Prince Edward , he just played it off so perfectly and was such a pleasure to watch on the screen . Enchanted is one of the year's best films , I would highly recommend it for you or the family , it's a definite treasure of
482266	1293485	469494	10.0	Truly a piece of work	A few months ago I saw the trailer to There Will Be Blood , at first I was a little put off , it looked very strange and a typical drawn out drama . But then a little later , I saw a different trailer that was much better and looked more interesting . So now it had all this hype and is now nominated for 7 Oscars , including best picture , finally it came to theaters in my home town and my mom and I just saw it . Now , I'm just going to get a complaint out , I think this movie was still a little drawn out , it kind of took on a Kubrick type of feel with the first twenty minutes that had no dialog . But that was the only thing that threw me off . While I'm not as in love with this movie as much as everyone else is , There Will be Blood is going to be a sure classic down the line . The direction , the acting , the script , the sets , everything about this film was done beautifully and shows the utter greed and madness that can turn men into monsters . Daniel Plainview is an oil man , he's in the business with his son , H . W . , and he goes around buying land very cheaply , and makes thousands and thousands of dollars when he strikes oil . But when he comes a town called Little Boston led by the tip of a boy named Paul , he buys the land promising the church that he will donate five thousand dollars to it . Eli , the leader of the church , claims he is a prophet and goes to the extreme to prove so with his followers . When Daniel's team is draining oil , his son is blasted away from an explosion of oil and looses his hearing , Daniel at this point just goes mad and meets a man who claims to be his brother , but he later finds out that this man lied to him . He abandons his son and is loosing all sanity , but when the church comes back to him , he claims he is saved . Years later though , he goes from business man to monster and is going to " drink Eli's milk shake " , you'll see what I mean when you see the film . There Will Be Blood is a film of utter perfection , the reason why I'm rating it so high is because it is a perfectly made film . There's nothing wrong with it , when I said it's a little drawn out , it's just my opinion . But Daniel Day Lewis pulls in a flawless performance and became Daniel Plainview , especially the end , he pulled in such a chilling side and didn't over do the dialog , which I'm sure any other actor would have done . But one performance I am particularly impressed with is Paul Dano's as Eli / Paul , Eli really got to me and was incredible during his sermons , he held his own up to Lewis . He's come a long way since the silent rebel in Litte Miss Sunshine . There Will Be Blood is a GOOD movie , I mean good in the highest regards , because how many of us can say when a film is just utterly good ? Not too often . There Will Be Blood is going to be a good contender this year for the Oscars , but we'll just have to see who'll take the best picture award , because we have some good films that are competing .
482798	1293485	312318	10.0	It got me thinking	My roommate had bought this documentary and invited me to watch it with her . She's from China and only heard so much about and wanted to know the cold hard truth and she wanted me to tell her more after the documentary . I felt awful watching this documentary , it was like reliving the nightmare and it still brings tears to my eyes . But I'm extremely grateful that I watched this documentary , because on the day of September 11th , I'm sure we all remember where we were and what we were doing when we heard , all of us could only think certain questions : " Why ? " , " How ? " , " What's going on ? " , " Oh , my God ! " . Almost all the Americans were grateful for the brave firemen and policemen that risked their lives to save others . But I don't think we thought about what they were really going though . This wasn't actually supposed to be a documentary about , the cameraman was just filming a typical day on the job and they just happened to be a couple blocks away from the World Trade Centers and got everything , outside and in , on tape . On Sep . 11th , I thought to myself " It's OK , the policemen and firemen will get the people out that survived " . To be honest , I thought it was an accident , I was in my junior year of high school and getting changed from gym and getting ready to go to my science class . Someone came into the locker room shouting " Some building just got bombed in New York ! " , we all got dressed quickly and ran to our classrooms as we watched the first tower burning on TV . Not only 15 seconds later live on TV does the second plane crash into the other World Trade Center and we knew this was no accident . A few minutes later , we heard about the Pentagon and that there was a plane headed for Chicago but was shot down . So many thoughts ran through our heads and I kept on thinking " What are the firemen and policemen going to do ? " . But it's procedure to them I thought , they'll know what to do . The first tower collapsed , we knew it , so many lives are now gone , the second tower crashed , things would never be the same . Those firemen in this documentary showed courage , confusion , and strength , the real raw human emotions . They didn't know what to do , they were just as scarred as those other people who were in the towers . They heard the bodies collapsing on the ground from people jumping out the windows . And here I was in a classroom just crying seeing all that was going on on TV . I was amazed with this film and just wanted to go to New York and tell them how grateful all the Americans were for their help . I know they feel like they were just doing their job , but they did more , they were hero's . Every day after Sep . 11th for 3 weeks they kept on digging knowing that there were no survivors , but they kept on hoping and praying . May God bless their kind and brave hearts . As for my roommate she was crying and admitted this was her first time crying at these attacks . She got to see the truth of what had happened that tragic day . She asked " Why ? " . I didn't know what to say , it breaks my heart that people can be that evil . " It sounds clique ' , but it was a normal day for everyone " one of the firemen said in the documentary . No one expected this to happen . Not like that , those people in the World Trade Centers or the Pentagon or the planes that were hijacked , they were just doing their job , happen to be there , or even just was there for a second passing by . They were not just murdered , they were slaughtered , and those hijackers did it with a song in their heart . Then seeing in the middle east all the people celebrating , why do people do this ? They celebrated death and the lose of : mothers , fathers , sisters , brothers , friends , grandparents , aunts , uncles , cousins , etc . Why ? So , thanks to those people for making this documentary . You truly think about the firemen , policemen , and the troops in Iraq and it keeps your hope up that there are good people in this world . Thank you to all those people , you are our heroes .
482257	1293485	48605	10.0	One of my new favorite romantic comedies	Lately , I have been really been getting into the classics , not to mention some new favorite actors . I always had wondered what the Marilyn Monroe movies were like . Because I always did love her in Some Like it Hot . She's not like today's actresses , she's not a stick , she looks so cute and like she has fun on screen . Not to mention she was a very beautiful actress . The Seven Year Itch is a great romantic comedy where a man has sent his wife and son into the country while he works on his business over the summer . But after 7 years of marriage , he meets the new house sitter , played by Marilyn , and falls completely for her , causing a 7 year itch . He has also a wild imagination and just let's it go with him thinking he'll get caught , what if his wife is cheating on him , or what his life would be like if he was with Marilyn instead of his wife . This is a very charming and lovable romantic comedy and will remain with that timeless image of Marilyn's white dress blowing up in the air . She's so adorable and anyone can easily become a fan of her's when they see this movie . It's a fun movie to watch and I highly recommend it .
482723	1293485	120768	10.0	An intense thriller	God , I love Kevin Spacey . He is an amazing actor . His performance was flawless in this film . And Samuel L . Jackson is just as perfect . He gets into his characters with such passion . I love it . " The Negotiator " is a remarkable film . I was really impressed . I was a little curious when I went to " Blockbuster " I saw the film on display . I love Kevin Spacey , but ever since the incident of " House of the Dead " shudder , I check IMDb first . I saw that it had a rating of 7 . 2 . I figured that I'd give it a shot . I'm glad I did . This is a great movie . You should watch it if you are a Kevin fan . Or a Samuel fan . Especially if you loved movies like " Die Hard " , " Terminator " , or " Lethal Weapon " . I would highly recommend it .
482547	1293485	110932	10.0	What can I say ? That's show business !	The other day when I was renting movies I passed this one called Quiz Show , never heard of it , wasn't too sure if it would be good or not , so I figured I would just wait and check it out on IMDb . When I saw the rating I was very impressed , not to mention how this was nominated for best picture of ' 94 , considering it was up against : Forrest Gump , Pulp Fiction , and Shawshank Redemption , it didn't really stand a chance . But I rented this movie and I'm convinced that 1994 had to be one of the best years for films . Quiz Show is an incredibly impressive film by Robert Redford , which I didn't even realize that this guy could direct ! The story is just a perfect one for any type of a debate conversation on what is right and what is wrong . 21 is a popular TV quiz show in the 50's where they ask very hard questions and the guests win lots of money , Herb Stempel has been the reigning champion for weeks . But he's not exactly what you would call the TV hunk , he's got the " radio face " . Charles Van Doren is a huge fan of quiz shows , so he auditions , and when the executives see him , they go crazy over him , he's handsome , he's smart , he's charismatic , and his family is famous . They tell Herb to " dive down " and get a wrong answer so that Charles can take over as the champion . Everything seems to go smoothly , that is until Harvard grad government agent Dick Goodwin is convinced that there's something wrong . He is determined to prove that the show is rigged and that 21 is ripping of America's intellects . Quiz Show is a great film , the acting , the picture , the editing , everything about this film is pretty much flawless . I couldn't believe that this film is not anywhere near the top 250 , I don't see any problems with the film . But I know every film has a hater or two . But for me the film , acting wise , the film went to Ralph Fiennes , he did an incredible performance and was so touching during his statement to the jury . I just would highly recommend this film to anyone , this is a great film and Robert Redford did a terrific job .
