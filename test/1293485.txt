483590	1293485	118539	1.0	Was it just me , or did anyone else feel like they were watching a Kraft cheese commercial ?	I swear at the beginning with the parents , I felt like they were just smiling too much and it looked like they were just going to say cliché ' things like " Oh , you kids ! " or " That's coming out of your allowance " while smiling at the camera on cue . Now , granted , this is a movie for kids , but I think we are starting to insult our kids just a little bit . I mean , we do actually have a decent cast for a kid's flick , but these adults really sunk beyond the kid's humor . While it has some good morals and another happy ending , just the jokes got old and I think we are just insulting our kid's intelligence and humor . PS : Loni , lay off the fake tan !
482160	1293485	92076	1.0	Oh , please tell me they did not do this !	I hated this movie ! It just completely ruined the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre . Why ? Oh , why did they make this movie ? Little SpoilerNow is it just me , because I thought that when Leatherface came in with a chainsaw and the girl was sitting next to the beer , and Leatherface hit the beer with the chainsaw and it was spraying all over her , wasn't that rediculous ? Good God ! I can't believe this isn't on the bottom
482468	1293485	443649	1.0	I never realized how good the dental insurance was back then for cave men	OK , after hearing many horrible reviews for 10 , 000 BC , I have to say that I was really put off , this I was assuming was supposed to be the big kick off to the huge block busters . But I got to see it for free , and I always think that sometimes people just misjudge a film , even though my co-worker warned me , I still went for it and saw it . Thank God the movie ended when it did , I had the neuce around my neck by the end of this film . I mean , seriously , did the " writer " do any history homework ? ! First off , let's talk about appearances , the " cave men " have perfect teeth , have evolved well for what's supposed to be over 10 , 000 years ago , and remove the dirt , they're skin belongs in a Neutragina ad . Script ? Was there one ? I have no idea , the story made absolutely no sense and the ending was horrible . I don't want to give away what happens , but trust me , I think you'll be as confused as I was . I'm going to try my best to explain the plot to you , it's high school drama with cave men , so bare with me . De'Leh is a cave man with his tribe and has earned the title of " best warrior " , he is allowed to have any woman , so he picks his childhood sweet heart , Evolet , but he later feels as if he didn't earn that right , so he " gives her up " . She is kidnapped by another gang , oh , no ! Whatever will he do ? He gave her up , but he still digs her and never even got a kiss ! So he goes after her with a few of his friends and find themselves fighting saber-tooth's , monstrous snow storms , a snake river , and even a god who got a bad nail job . Oh , let's hope he can save his girlfriend in time and all will be well . That's the Cliff's Notes version I can come up with . May I just say that I absolutely loved how the cave men spoke perfect English , seriously , I didn't realize that it was possible for them to speak that well in American English . This script was written for 12 year old's , seriously . Then they put in these awkward jokes , strange characters that are more laughable than serious , and a love story that would seriously be so non-existent if this was an accurate portrayal of history . I don't mind when they " bend " the truth for dramatic purposes , but this was the friggin ' Seasamse Street version of cave men history . Stay away from this trash , it's just a waste of time , sadly , how many good movies could have been made with the budget they probably put onto this film ? I'm seeing at least 7 already .
482646	1293485	1045655	1.0	Let's put it this way . . .	After this painful movie , I drank , I did illegal substances , I even beat myself with a shovel , and still I was in pain from watching this horrible movie ! The Haunting of Molly Hartley or as I'm going to call it from this point on " pretty white kids with satanic problems " , where do I eve begin on how awful this film was ? OK , let's start with the actors , horrible horrible actors that only got their roles because they were just too beautiful to pass up on . The editing / scare tactics : let's make loud noise constantly , that'll make the audience jump . The script : let's make up a non-sense story about a teenage girl who has powers from Satan and we'll put her in high school with other pretty people and while she has to go through the hardships of being a teenager . Even though the story in no way makes sense , we have a Zac Efron look a like , so we're going to get a huge female teen audience and they'll love this film . Oh , boy , I'm rambling , OK , let's just say this , if you were , you'd see all the bruises on my head from banging it on the wall after watching this movie that I'll never know how it got green lighted . Molly Hartley is the new girl at school who is very subtle about her strange side , she has headaches that lead to disillusions about her mother who tried to kill her a few years ago , she automatically stays away from people and is getting hit on by the most pretty rich boy in the whole school , but she is absolutely refusing to do anything until her father takes her to the hospital and they find a brain tumor , so it seems like everything will be all good after they remove it , but things are obviously not getting better when her mother escapes the insane asylum to kill Molly before she hits her 18th birthday to gain full powers of the devil . . . yeah , wow . Oh , boy , I wish there was a rating lower than 1 , because honestly this film is one of the worst I've ever seen in my life . It's just so odd to me that there are some films that people absolutely refuse to give a fair chance , yet this movie that has no right to be called a horror movie has a 3 . 4 rating ? Come on , this belongs in the bottom 100 here on IMDb , I'm going to be a good citizen , please , stay away from this movie , save yourself the pain I had to endure . I had to take my cousin to see this , now I feel that I can never let her pick a film again , because for my health's sake , I just can never see a movie like this again , I'll go insane . Just trust me , this is a very very bad film , film ? Why did I say that ? This is trash , just trust me , the only thing horrific about this is that I wasted 90 minutes of my life that I will never get back . . . I could have watched paint dry , that has more meaning than this stupid movie ever will .
482424	1293485	55562	1.0	Oh , God ! Not again !	Why ? ! Who in the hell hired the people who actually thought this would be a good movie ? ! Some movies just shouldn't be made and this one is an example . First " Prince of Space " and now this ? ! OK , again , I loved the MSTK3 episode , but this is so silly . How do movies like this get made ? I mean , it's the same exact plot of " Prince of Space " . Except without the gracious laugh of the annoying villain . That's a plus . Other than that , this film is awful . I don't get how these movies ever get made . Oh , well . I guess it's one of those questions that will never be answered . Obviously .
482108	1293485	131550	1.0	Rowsdower Rowsdower Rowser Rowser Rowsdower Bowsa Bowsa Lowsdower Zabbity Zabbity Zowsdower Bibbity Bobbity Bowsdower Bobbity Dobbity Dower Rows . . . . . Dower	OK , hands down , The Final Sacrifice is the best Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode . I'm still laughing every time I think of this movie , it's just , how do movies like this get green lighted ? Or did the director ever stop and wonder if he was making a good movie ? The acting and characters were just so unintentionally laughable , it's insane . I can't believe they gave the " hero " a name like Zap Rasdower , that's such a stupid name , but it made for a good laugh , that's for sure . The kid , Troy , looked like such a Lord of the Rings type of dork ( no offense to the LOTR fans , it's cool that you like it ) that you couldn't help but wanna get inside the film and knock the books out of his hands . The villain or Canadian villain Garth Vador had this ridicules voice , and were did Mike Piper get his voice ? Was Yo Sammity Sam like his inspiration ? This is just such a ridicules story . Troy is looking for who caused the death of his father , he finds a map that is supposed to lead him to a lost world . But this cult lead by Garth Vador is after him and wants him dead and wants the map , but Troy outsmarts them by getting on his ten speed bike to out run them . He gets off his bike and hitches a ride with Zap Rowsdower and together they go to find out what this is all about and why Troy's father died . Maybe they can also find out why Rowswer is a . . . hopeless drunk . The Final Sacrifice is one of those movies you'll never believe got made , it's just so laughable . I highly recommend the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version , it's just beyond funny , I loved every moment in that episode . But I hope the director watched that episode because I wanna see a Zap and Troy spin off , that would be an awesome show with an occasional guest appearance of Mike Pipper . I smell the Emmy's coming for best new show , lol .
483083	1293485	949731	1.0	This film made me confused , paralyzed , then I tried to hang myself afterwards	M . Night Shyamalan's first Rated R film and he blew it completely , I remember this year actually wanting to see this movie , it looked really interesting and Mark Wahlberg is becoming a more great actor in his experience . The only problem here is M . Night Shyamalan , this man is constantly credited for Signs and The Sixth Sense . . . that's it , because that and Unbreakable are his only good movies . Honestly , he's just loosing it , I think he's become so cocky and now he's trying to have more of an edge with this R rating . His story lacks any sense , there are just so many things wrong with this story and not to mention the characters have no sympathy . Nothing was ever properly explained and there are tons of plot holes . The ending was just a cop out , it was nice to see that Shyamalan didn't go for his typical " twist " ending , but still this story just needed so much work and probably would've been better under someone else's name . According to reports , citizens in the vicinity of Central Park have suddenly and inexplicably begun seizing up just before killing themselves by whatever means are at their disposal . As the phenomena begins to spread and talk of terrorism fills the airwaves , Elliot , his wife , Alma , their friend Julian , and his daughter , Jess , board a train bound for the presumed safety of the country . When the train screeches to a halt before arriving at its final destination , however , the frightened passengers are forced to fend for themselves as each consecutive news report paints an increasingly grim picture of the situation in more urbanized areas . Theories abound on what could be causing the unexplainable rash of suicides , but the only thing that everyone seems to agree on is that it's some kind of airborne contagion that is carried in the wind . I feel so bad for saying this , but seriously , I was laughing at the suicide scenes . I don't know why , just first there is a police officer who shoots himself in the head , literally his forehead , why would you aim it that way ? Also a trainer feeds himself to his tigers that rip his arms off instead of knocking him down and people film it ? ! There is a woman who is on the phone with her daughter , puts her on speaker in front of a group of people to hear her commit suicide ? ! Also , Julian just leaves his daughter to find her most likely dead mother in the hands of a woman he doesn't trust , yes , let's leave the daughter and most likely make her an orphan . Gosh , I could go on and on about how horrible this movie is , but I think I'd run out of room . Just trust me , the story is just horrible and could've been good if maybe made more as an independent film , but Shyamala-ding-dong just ruined it .
482756	1293485	120860	1.0	I wasn't impressed	After seeing From Dusk Till Dawn , I was looking forward to seeing the second film , I knew it had a crummy rating , but I figured to give it a shot . Who knows ? I thought since it had Robert Patrick and Bruce Cambell , that it might have potential . But I just watched it and I'm hoping for that hour and a half back because this was a pretty sad movie . First off , it wasn't anywhere near as good as the first From Dusk Till Dawn film and it had a bunch of shots that the director was trying to impress people with but it ended up making the film look cheesy . The plot was just ridicules , it could have had something , but instead it was pretty stupid . I mean , who knew that vampires needed money so badly ? That they too can rob banks ? How did some of the characters who supposedly died in the last film come back to life ? How did the strip club come back ? I don't know , but this was just a bad idea . Buck , his brother , and his friends are in Mexico to rob a bank for millions of dollars . But when a friend of their's , Luther is running late for their meeting . His car breaks down on the road and he heads for the same club as the first film and of course is turned into a vampire and then comes back for his friends . Buck is unaware of what is to happen when his friends take him to the bank and he finds out that maybe he'd rather just go to jail then be with these blood suckers . From Dusk Till Dawn 2 : Texas Blood Money has extremely pointless moments , like the beginning sequence with Bruce Cambell and Tiffani Amber Thieson , it never had anything to do with the story . The acting was bad and the action wasn't really that exciting . They also kept cutting to an edit of the boys watching a porno movie , so it was like they were trying to have some sex in there the cheap way I guess . I don't know , I just really feel like my time was wasted with From Dusk Till Dawn 2 : Texas Blood Money . I'd rather just stick with the original and I suggest you do the same .
482415	1293485	120915	1.0	OH . . . MY . . . GOD ! What have they done ? !	How . . . why . . . who . . . WHAT DID THEY DO ? " Star Wars " in the now is like waiting for a disaster to happen ! They destroyed the story . How could they ? I used to love Liam Neeson , but he has truely lost my respect . The " Star Wars " trilogy is one of the greatest trilogies ever . Then they give us this ! This ? ! Nothing but big computer effects . Characters that are dull and boring . The plot did not put me on the edge of my seat , thank you very much . I do not get how this movie has a rating of 6 . 5 . How ? ! It doesn't even deserve my kind rating of 1 . But unfortunatly , that's all IMDB gives me to rate . And if 1 is " awful " , this is being to merciful . This was beyond awful . But until then , I'll have to stick with giving it :
483317	1293485	426615	1.0	Very possibly the worst movie I have ever seen	And that's pretty sad , because I've seen a bunch of horrible movies , but this one is in a class of it's own . Now , I'm going to be honest , I wanted to see this film when it was first released in the theaters . It looked kinda like a fun movie , but I decided to wait until it was for rent . I knew this movie had a bad rating on IMDb , but I figured it was just because Usher was one of the biggest stars at the time and people were just trying to trash him . Boy , I apologize for doubting the views of the IMDb users . First off , what was the screenwriter on when he wrote this ? Or was he simply reading " Screenwriting for dummies " ? What the hell does he or the director take me for ? ! I grew up in friggin ' little Italy / Chicago ! I'm not stupid . Now , not to sound horrible , but this movie was totally inaccurate on how a mafia boss would let an African American watch his daughter . Never would happen in a million years . Not to mention the horrible stereo types in this film ! It was horrible . The two lovers had no chemistry and the plot was . . . . ahh ! Just never see this movie ever ever ever !
482471	1293485	839980	2.0	Will Ferrell can hold a 15 minute skit , not an hour and a half movie	I work in a movie theater part time and we got Semi-Pro , now I hate Will Ferrell with a passion , I don't get how people love his movies , some of them are funny , but it's more of his side characters that get the laughs from me . But I figured , I needed a laugh after work and I decided to just go ahead and see the movie , it might have a few good laughs , I saw it for fee and even that was too much for what this film was . I'm very much not kidding , this movie , the theater was about 75 % full and there was only two people who laughed , even that was just a chuckle . I don't get what is so funny about making Will Ferrell puke , in fact let's play on that joke quite a bit so it becomes more awkward . Let's also put in jokes that refer to " the future " since it's set in the 70's , that'll be a blast . And also , let's put in some extremely uncomfortable shots of Will Ferrell's crotch , yeah , that was so funny , that I wanted to puke . Jackie Moon is a one hit wonder in the 70's , but with the money he made off that , he buys the Flint Tropical's , a team that once was great , but now stink . They have an opportunity though to go to the NBA if they can be one of the top four teams to win the games . With the help of a former champion basketball player , Monix , who has lost it basically , they'll try to achieve the best , by getting fourth place . Jackie comes up with some stupid publicity stunts to get an audience as well . Semi-Pro is seriously , just stupid , I'm not saying that because of Will Ferrell , I just mean this film is very unfunny and the only part that made me laugh was the bear attacking Will Ferrell , sad , huh ? I'm really not trying to be a hater on this film , but how do people laugh at this junk ? Will Ferrell plays the same character in each of his films , doesn't anyone catch on ? The characters in this film are not likable at all because they're not explained well . Semi-Pro was just a bad movie , I promise you , I'm not saying this because of Will , I'm saying in general , just stay away from this film .
483518	1293485	110982	2.0	The last and the worst in the Nerd series	I bought the " atomic wedgie " edition of Revenge of the Nerds , it had all the sequels in it , so I watched Revenge of the Nerds 2 and 3 today before the fourth one , and I was actually surprised . Despite their bad rating , I really enjoyed them , sure they weren't as good as the first , but they had their laughs . So I was looking forward to Revenge of the Nerds IV : Nerds in Love , because I figured that if I liked the other sequels , I would like this one , but it turned out to be different . Despite the fact that there were a couple of laughs , for the most part this was just a recycled story that really didn't work or click as well as the other stories did . Booger is finally settling down , that's right , the perverted nose picker is tying the knot . Now he's not just marrying some girl , but she comes from a very important and rich family where her father is involved in politics . But her father and brother in-law absolutely hate Booger on site and are anti-nerd . So naturally they want to ruin the wedding by getting some dirt on Booger . But his friends , including best man , Lewis , are determined to make sure that everything goes smoothly and give the father and brother in-law a new perspective on nerds in love . Revenge of the Nerds IV : Nerds in Love isn't the worst movie on Earth , but it's just the worst movie in the Nerds series , so I really wouldn't recommend it . It just wasn't needed since the story was so bland and reused from the other films , if it was completely different , it might have worked , but it was just the same jokes . However I did laugh a couple times still , I can't help it , these guys do crack me up , so I'm going to be kind with my rating , at least I think it is with how much of a waste of a good story was on this sequel .
483239	1293485	349467	2.0	Good thing it wasn't just me that didn't like this movie , because I was so bored !	My friend wanted to watch a movie and decided to rent Freedomland since I had seen all the recently released flicks , I wasn't too interested , but I figured to give the movie a chance , I'm usually up for anything . But I have to say that Freedomland couldn't decide on what story to stick upon , not to mention the " big surprise ending " wasn't that much of a surprise . The story is totally confusing and I don't see how this movie even has a 4 . 9 rating to be quite honest . It starts off with Julianne Moore going into the hospital with bloody hands , Samuel L . Jackson is a detective and finds out that her car has been stolen with her son in it ! During a huge crisis in their bad neighborhood , murders happening left and right , and then trying to focus on Julianne's son , it was just too much , I'm letting you know right now . Freedomland could've had good potential , and I don't mind Julianne Moore , but she seemed so miscast in the film and actually seemed like an amateur . The only person worth watching was Samuel and he wasn't even that big of a deal , I'm warning you right now , you'll have to watch this movie a few times before you actually understand the plot , because I really didn't understand anything that happened in this film .
483502	1293485	118583	3.0	It lost the originality somewhere	I somewhat enjoyed " Resurrection " , but didn't at the same time . Even though I'm not a fan of the first " Alien " , I will never doubt that the story was original . " Aliens " was highly entertaining and original at the same time . " Alien 3 " was an alright movie , with a few disappointments . But now I finish up these movies with a pretty bad ending . I think that " Alien : Resurrection " was trying to get back to the original . But it just couldn't . Even though I worship Joss Whendon on his very awesome screenplays , this movie couldn't work . I'm sorry , Joss ! Please , get back to Buffy ! Ahem . Sorry , I'm still traumatized ! : D But I would recommend " Resurrection " to finish of the movies . Otherwise for a watch , na . I'd rather not .
482805	1293485	294345	3.0	Great , Beethoven meets the Prince and the Pauper	Like I said before , my cousins and I had a Beethoven night , I was looking forward to the sequels , but after the sadness that was the third Beethoven , I had something even more to look forward too . Somehow , Beethoven is still with the brand new Newtons , I guess George , Alice , and their kids were looking for some kind of good excuse to get rid of Beethoven . Basically , Beth and Richard want to get rid of Beethoven due to poor habits of drooling and destroying , but the kids want to keep him so they secretly take Beethoven to obedience classes . But Richard finds out that Beethoven inspires him to create his best art pieces ever . There is another family who is more wealthy and also have a St . Bernard , Michaelangelo , and kidnappers want him so they can get a ransom , not that much money if you ask me , but Beethoven and Michaelanglo get mixed up when they're both outside and end up with the wrong families . Beethoven's 4th is a pretty sorry excuse for a film , but it was a little better than the third Beethoven movie . My cousins really enjoy these films , so like I said before , these films must be doing something right . For a family film , it wouldn't be too bad , but for me , this was a pretty silly movie .
483109	1293485	117802	3.0	To be honest , I felt awkward watching this movie	I have heard a lot about Swingers and how funny it is , in fact I had a friend almost yell at me when he found out that I have seen so many movies but I have not seen Swingers . So , obviously , I had to save the friendship , : P , so I went out to rent this . I am going to feel so bad about what to tell my friend because I really didn't get too into Swingers . I can see why this is a cult classic , I would never deny that it wasn't a good movie . I just really didn't laugh , there were a couple moments where I laughed very lightly , that was it . But the scene where Mike calls that girl Niki like 10 times to leave stupid messages , I laughed , but it was just so painful to watch . Now , I love Vince Vaughn , he is just a crazy and funny comedic actor , but I found him to be a little bit annoying in this movie . I don't mind repeated lines every once in a while , but " money " was just way too over used . Like I said , I'm not calling this a bad movie , because I can see why people got so into it , but I just didn't really enjoy it . I might give it a second shot just to see if there is anything there . Hopefully there is , otherwise my friend might question my expertise in movies . :
483408	1293485	120891	3.0	Strange cast	A little over a month ago , I saw Wild Wild West at Target for $4 . 50 , I heard horrible things about the film , but I figured , it's the rental price , sometimes these movies are not as bad as most say . So I went ahead and bought it , my mistake , I watched it tonite and wasn't really impressed . I mean , while it's a little better than what most would say , it does fall flat with too many fancy effects and Will Smith almost has a love affair with himself in this film . Now Will Smith is one of those rare actors that you can tell on screen as well as off that he has a huge ego , but everyone still loves him because he has a charm and such a presence on screen , he's easy to forgive . However , even though I am not a fan of The Matrix , he turned down The Matrix for this ? ! What the heck was he thinking ? This movie was just very average and held nothing special . Jim West is a war hero who is just loving life as it's loving him right back , he's pretty much won everything he's been handed . Artemus Gordon is a master of disguise and a genius , so when an evil master mind , Loveless , threatens to take over , President Grant partners Artemus and Jim together who of course at first have no chemistry and have to capture Loveless . When a can can girl comes into play , who wants to save " her father " , she helps them track down Loveless and they must come up with a clever idea to defeat him . Now , Wild Wild West isn't a bad film , it's just made a little strange . Like the cast , Will Smith may be charming , but this movie , he comes off more of a jerk than a smooth cowboy . Selma Hayek , beautiful girl , strange role to take on , the accent was a little distracting I'd say , not to mention I wasn't really impressed with the " acting qualities " she has . Now , for a family film , this isn't a bad idea , it's cute in some moments and funny in others , but for a film on entertainment that you're just looking for a good time ? I wouldn't really recommend it .
482220	1293485	346156	3.0	Nah	Wow , why didn't we just put the actors in the CGI themselves ? That's all this movie was missing . Well , while Sky Captain touches the classic film noir , it looses it majorly within the special effects . Let's face it , this movie had stars in it and was just a way of getting people to come to the movie because of it's staring cast . In my opinion this movie just was not entertaining . Wither it was because of the special effects or the story in general , I don't know , but I wouldn't watch this film again . Nor would I really recommend it unless you are highly into CGI effects .
482492	1293485	285742	4.0	Utterly Depressing	Best screenplay , no , really didn't even need a nomination . Best actress , NO ! Halle , she's a great actress , but this was not best actress worthy . And so not worth her raving speech as if she had broken all berriors for black actresses in Hollywood . I might have agreed with the nomination , but I've seen way too many actresses at the Oscars who deserved the Oscar getting passed on because of their rep or age . Halle is young , but I think the Oscars felt more like she needed this Oscar instead of earning it . The story of Monster's Ball has no point and could have gone on for hours . Both Halle and Bill's character went no where . It's like most movies have the characters go from point A to point B , but not in Monster's Ball . I think also the two sons in the beginning were like trash to the script writer , when it's at it's fullest , throw it out ! I just didn't feel that much after this movie was done . I'm sorry , but this was not that good of a movie .
483607	1293485	95889	4.0	Well , they're baaack agaaaain	Poltergeist 3 was one of those mistake sequels that was an unnecessary movie to make in the first place . The second one ended the story just right and made us feel comfortable with it . The third Poltergeist might have worked , but the only characters that came back was Carol Anne and Tabith , I think her name was , you know that lady with the annoying voice ? Well , it just didn't work as well without the other cast , not to mention they felt like a shove off with this plot . Carol Anne is sent off to live with her aunt and uncle in Chicago temporally , she is going to a special school to help her out with all her trauma from home . But the ghost have followed her again to wreak havoc on her and her new family . Only this time , there are more " jumpy " scenes to freak the audience out . It isn't a terrible sequel , it just wasn't necessary and it was sad to look at that little girl's face knowing she died during the filming of this movie . Such a short life , but at least she'll always be remembered and a great treasure for horror fans . But I would only recommend this sequel for those who wish to complete the sequel . Like I said , it isn't bad , it just wasn't fair to the original movies and it was sad to see Carol Anne in her last days , but I guess you'll just have to judge for yourself .
483240	1293485	426459	4.0	I knew it , I knew this movie would have some kind of undeserved 6 . 5 rating	It's really scary , because I was watching Feast and wasn't really enjoying it , but then I thought when I was going to comment on it that it'd probably have a 6 . 5 rating for those " cult lovers " . Somewhere down the road I thought maybe I could see this movie getting more appreciated , but right now I wasn't too into it . I saw this movie getting advertised on the Sci-fi channel and a critic was just raving about it and how scary it was . So , even though I never heard of it , I decided to rent it . It's about these strangers in a bar who are just frankly , are a bunch of jerks , and when two people come into the bar bloodied up and say that there are aliens attacking them , the creatures decide to attack the whole bar . They have to band together and figure out a way to defeat the aliens and get out of the bar alive , but it'll be hard since the aliens keep reproducing babies . Sometimes comedy and sometimes horror , two genres that need to be carefully put together , but it failed in my opinion . The only part that made me laugh hysterically was when the " actress " got in the truck and sped off , it was pretty funny . This movie kinda reminded me of " Dead Alive " which I also didn't enjoy , so I think that's why I didn't get into it . But to those others who did enjoy it , it's cool , I see this movie becoming a cult classic in the near future , but it didn't amuse me .
482134	1293485	324554	4.0	Explained too late	I couldn't get past all the confusion at the beginning . I was just wondering what the heck was going on ? And where was this movie going ? It wasn't too bad . After all , I did like " Vanilla Sky " . But you spend most of the movie just frustrated . SPOILER ! ! ! ! Josh Hartnett is Matthew . A guy from Chicago with a future and a life ahead of him . He has a wonderful fiancée . She does absolutely nothing wrong . He lies to her about his business trip to China . He instead stays in Chicago to see an old flame . And as it turns out his old flame's best friend is keeping them apart . The best friend is Alex . She is also in love with Matthew . But Matthew's best friend is in love with her . It gets more confusing . I did get it . But I'm not going to see it again .
482872	1293485	149215	4.0	Yeah , it's silly , but take it for what it's worth	I had to rent a couple of movies for my little cousin for New Year's and she picked out The Swan Princess : The Mystery of the Enchanted Kingdom and The Little Mermaid 2 and we just watched both films , while she's sleeping , I figured I could get a couple comments in . : ) While this is a very cheesy cartoon , it really wasn't that bad . You have to admit that for children , these plots are new to them and it could be a great introduction of these stories to them . Odette finds out that Derek has been secretly keeping the magic secrets of Rosthoe and she tells Derek to destroy them immediately , but him being a guy , typically he does not do so and tells her that no on could achieve the magics without his help . When a witch named Zelda gets her hands on them , she finds out that Derek tore off the last words of a spell she wants to use to destroy everything , and she kidnaps Odette in order to retrieve this information . The Swan Princess : The Mystery of the Enchanted Kingdom is silly and predictable , but for the kids I would honestly say it's a go . It's so rare we have these clean cut cartoons now a days , so I'm going to cut the film some slack . It was just weird seeing all the voices change all of a sudden , I grew up with the first one , so I guess it was just stuck in my head .
482527	1293485	424993	4.0	Honestly ? It has it's moments here and there , but it's one of those films that are so stupid that it's funny	I had absolutely no interest what so ever in seeing Employee of the Month , let's face it , Jessica Simpson does not equal movie of the year . But my friends and I were stuck inside yesterday and my friend's brother rented Employee of the Month and said that it was pretty funny , so we decided to watch it . While I admit there were a few funny moments , it's the same pointless humor that you see in an average comedy . Jessica , well , even though she wasn't horrible , she wasn't that much of an addition to the cast , her part was just smiles and giggles , so it wasn't that much of a part . Basically , Guy is an employee at a " Sam's Club " sort of speak , only he doesn't take his work very seriously , Vince is the only employee who goes above and beyond his work making employee of the month for 17 months in a row and is about to win a car if he wins employee of the month once again . But all that changes when a new girl , Amy , starts working with them and now Guy and Vince are competing for employee of the month since they heard about Amy only liking the best workers . But Guy is about to . . . you guessed it . . . loose touch with who he really is and same with loosing his friends . While it's a pretty stupid movie , I have to admit that I had a few laughs here and there , it's silly humor , but it's all good . But I'm very serious and not just saying this , Jessica really needs to stay away from film because she doesn't add much to the screen besides incredibly low cut tops for the teenage boys . But this is one of those movies you have to decide for yourself , because if I actually had a few laughs , I'm not sure if my brain is functioning correctly .
483665	1293485	184791	4.0	Uhh . . . was that supposed to be sad at the ending ? Or were we allowed to laugh ? Because I did .	A little advice to the director , STOP WITH THE SOAP OPERA ! ! ! I know that Shakespeare stories are very sad and depressing but for God's sake ! It was so over dramatic . You don't feel for the characters . You think that two of the main characters are asses . And you think that the girl is very insincere . The ending isn't sad , because ( I hate to say this about Josh Hartnett , sorry Josh ! ) but BAD ACTING ! ! ! Even though I'm a fan of Josh Hartnett and saw this movie because he was in it , I just thought this was a bad pick . And maybe O should of concentrated on getting things straight with his girl then getting even . Especially when he hasn't asked other friends and seeing if she was cheating or suspected of it . So , I believe that Shakespeare is not going to be proud . Good luck to Mekhi , Josh , and Julia . Because I know you could do better .
483020	1293485	83630	5.0	The Cheesemaster is what it should be called	But for some reason , I admit , I somewhat enjoyed this flick despite it's incredible amount of cheesy moments and effects . I think because I used to watch this all the time when I was a kid , it's like a comfort blankie . But I mean the way Dar presented himself and how he hit on Kiri was nothing but a good laugh all the way . The villain is like a high school bully that could easily be beat . The only part of this movie to be honest with you that is just great to watch is the animals . Especially the ferrets and how just plain adorable they are ! : D I know , I know , but I would kind of recommend this movie in all good fun and humor . Sometimes you just need a good cheesy laugh , and you'll definitely receive it with The Beastmaster .
481991	1293485	167247	5.0	The Secret of Saurus Rock	The Land Before Time VI : The Secret of Saurus Rock , the sixth installment in the Land Before Time series . Again another decent enough sequel that gets a very unfair rating , this movie was a little step below the fifth sequel , but still I did enjoy watching this sequel because it focused more on family . Also just the responsibility some kids have to face when they have a new member in the family and how hard it can be to watch out for their younger relatives . A lot of kids could relate to this story . We also have a good moral that it's OK to ask the adults for help if a child does feel responsible for something they did and wants to fix it . The Secret of Saurus Rock certainly is a good story and once again just gives us lighthearted clean fun for the family and kids . Littlefoot's grandfather tells the children a story about " The Lone Dinosaur " , a legendary longneck who once protected the Great Valley from the most ferocious sharptooth ever to live . However , the sharptooth left " The Lone Dinosaur " with a scar slashed across his right eye . Soon after the battle , a huge monolith that resembled a proud sauropod , having life-sized tyrannosaur teeth arranged around his neck , came out of the ground during an earthquake . The dinosaurs called it " Saurus Rock " . The legend also states that if anyone damages the monolith , bad luck would descend upon the valley . A few days later when the kids are playing , Littlefoot accidentally falls off a cliff . Just before he hits the ground , a strange longneck dinosaur rescues him . This longneck introduces himself only as " Doc " and gives no knowledge of his history . Littlefoot is intrigued by this newcomer , who is scarred across one eye and displays prior knowledge of the Great Valley . For the preceding reasons , Littlefoot assumes that Doc is the Lone Dinosaur . Inspired , Cera's infant niece and nephew , the twins Dinah and Dana , go to Saurus Rock without anyone noticing . Later when the friends are playing , they notice that Dinah and Dana are missing . When they finally reach Saurus Rock , they see Dinah and Dana on the top . As they climb up to rescue them , Dinah and Dana fall off the top and land on Cera , causing the life-sized stone tooth on which she is standing to break off . Over the next few days , ill fortunes ranging from injuries to a tornado plague the valley . The adults blame Doc , in whose wake the misfortunes have apparently come , while Littlefoot blames himself and his friends , recalling the breaking of Saurus Rock . But Littlefoot is convinced that he can fix everything by going back to break off a dinosaur's sharp tooth to save the valley . The Land Before Time VI : The Secret of Saurus Rock is a good movie , I really liked the tribute to the lone ranger . Granted I know some kids won't get the little tribute to him , but it's still fun for them to see a dinosaur kind of cowboy , as silly as that sounds , it was good for the film . I also loved how Littlefoot just had this big heart and wanted to fix everything for his family and the other's in the Valley . The Secret of Saurus Rock is very fun to watch , I think it's a little notch below from what I've seen so far in the series , but not enough to say that this was a dreadful movie , I liked it and do recommend it for the kids and family .
483191	1293485	160127	5.0	Oh , those silly angels , if only they weren't so exploited	I remember in 2000 , I was a sophomore in high school , so naturally , you'd think this movie would've been perfect for me . But I got so annoyed with how advertised it was and how Cameron , Drew , and Lucy just wouldn't stop holding hands ! It was just so annoying and Charlie's Angels proved to be that this was the director's wet dream when he was a pre-teen looking up at those famous Farah Faucett posters . Charlie's Angels was a fun TV series in the 70's about three very attractive ladies : Alex , Dylon , and Natalie who fought crime and just had so much fun with their sex appeal . It was a fun time and wasn't too exploited , well , if you watch this movie , forget all that . I decided to wait until I was ready to watch this movie without being so judgemental , well , it reached my expectations when I was 15 ! Basically , the girls are just trying to save Charlie's life from a villain who thinks Charlie killed his dad . This film made me wonder , the 70's action sequences worked so well , so why did we need all the CGI effects in this film ? Not to mention , Cameron Diaz could break easily , this was so not believable . Cameron , Lucy , and Drew , these girls just didn't seem like the perfect angels . But maybe that's just me . Charlie's Angels wasn't as bad as I expected , but still , that's not saying much , it just couldn't stay on the right direction and was too exploited . I wouldn't mind taking a peek at the sequel , I'm hoping maybe they might do something right , but if the rating on IMDb is right , maybe I should think first .
483245	1293485	338526	5.0	An undecided vote	OK , after reading and hearing of votes for and against " Van Helsing " , I still wanted to see it . I took my mom to see it yesterday after it making a killing at the box office . I am still in a tose . I'm not sure whether I liked it or not . It's kind of like " Signs " , I just don't know if it was good or bad . There was things I liked , Frankenstein's character , Igor , the special effects , and the interesting story . But there were some things I didn't like , Kate Beckingsale's character , they tried to make some of the side kick's funny when they couldn't , and the lame and predictable plots of the story . Over all , you should judge for yourself . I can't really say whether this is a movie ultimatley worth seeing . But it's based on what you enjoy : computer effects or a story . If you want the computer effects , this is the movie for you . If you want a full story , it may not work for you . I'm still tied . Maybe in a year or two , I'll decide . :
483025	1293485	117826	5.0	Ah , so that's where Corey Feldman went	I was starting to wonder . Well , I saw this movie on Comedy Central . And I was a little disturbed with the movie . It's kind of stupid . But I do love " Tales from the Crypt " , so , I figured I'd go out and rent it . Without censorship . It's ok . Not my cup of tea . But I did get a couple laughs .
482258	1293485	397078	5.0	Not something I'd watch again , but I don't regret watching it	Seriously people , I thought that this was an honest , funny , and cute movie . The plot is a bit lame , of course , I mean what were you expecting from a Lindsay Lohan movie ? But still , I thought that it was just a fun little flick to watch . I loved having fun with my friends when we watched it because we were coming up with ideas on how Lindsay and this guy could still be together and how they'd have to have a chart and take turns with the luck . Maybe that's why I enjoyed it so much . But as a movie , yeah , it was a little lame . There were still a lot of funny and cute scenes , like when Lindsay looses her luck and she has to work as a janitor at her crush's old job . Her working in the high heels was so funny . I guess because I'm a girl and could relate to it . So , give this movie a chance , it really isn't that bad . If you are looking for it to be bad , than don't watch it .
481993	1293485	116817	5.0	Journey Through The Mists	The Land Before Time IV : Journey Through the Mists , the fourth installment into the Land Before Time series . I've been watching the sequels in the Land Before Time series because I'm curious about them , I loved the first Land Before Time and despite the sequels not having the best reputation , I still wanted to see what they were about . So far I really did enjoy the second movie , the third was decent and now Journey Through the Mists is pretty good . I think it's just as good as the third one , there's nothing that really stands out about it , but it still has a very good message about friendship and learning how to make new friends . It's very good for the kids to watch and I'm sure even some of the adults can get into this series as well for some light hearted fun . Littlefoot notices a longneck herd entering the Great Valley , and informs his grandparents . They tell him that the longnecks are their cousins , and that they must go and greet them . As the Old One , the leader of the herd , tells the residents of the Great Valley that her herd has been migratory since a heavy rain period turned their old home into a marshland called " The Land of Mists " , and became the home of many dangerous creatures , Littlefoot meets a longneck girl named Ali , and invites her to play . He introduces her to his friends , but as she is not used to associating with diverse species , she is afraid of them . Grandpa Longneck falls ill , and the Old One notes that the illness is lethal unless the victim eats the petals of the " Night Flower " , a flower which can only be found in the Land of Mists . Though Littlefoot is warned that the journey is too dangerous , he feels determined to save his grandfather , and asks Ali to take him there . She agrees , as the two of them make their way , they pass through a cave , and sudden earthquake causes a wall of rocks to crash down , separating them . Ali decides the others will have to help her free Littlefoot , and runs off to get them . Littlefoot , in the meantime , tries to find a way out , and meets Archie , who offers to help him dig through the rocks . They are interrupted by a belly dragger and a sharp beak named Dil and Ichy , who have their minds set to eat them . But Littlefoot's friends are not too far behind as they help Littlefoot and Ali . Together they continue the journey to help save Littlefoot's grandfather . The Land Before Time IV : Journey Through the Mists is a good animated film that I'm sure if you have an open mind , you'll enjoy it . There is so much dislike for these films , I think it's not just the songs but everyone is so determined that the first was the best and can't accept that there is a newer generation who wants to see new stories with Littlefoot and his friends . Over all I'm enjoying the series , even if it is a little cheesy , so far there hasn't been anything to hate . The fourth installment is a good one so I'm excited for the 5th movie and I'll give you an honest review of that movie as well .
482557	1293485	385752	5.0	One of those " You gotta read the book " movies	I remember last year seeing the trailer for The Golden Compass , now I'll be honest , I had no interest what so ever in seeing this film , but after seeing the Oscars , it was nominated for a few awards , so I wondered maybe if I had just misjudged the film . So I rented it this week and watched it yesterday with a very open mind ; while the movie was nicely made , the one thing I did not appreciate was this is a movie where if you haven't read the book , you'll have no idea what they are talking about really . The effects , the acting , the editing , etc . was very good , it's just the story that really gets your brain in an overload and at the end of the movie , you'll be like " What movie did I watch ? " . Lyra Belacqua lives in a very different world than our own , where pets are called " demons " and they can talk and change shape . But apparently there is some kind of organization where the demons and the children are being torn away from each other and the kids just disappear . When Lyra is taken by a beautiful woman , Marisa Coulter , but Marisa isn't so trust worthy when Lyra finds out that she's the one behind the organization and wants to use her for her special talent to read the golden compass and see into the world . The Golden Compass is a decent film , but like I said I was just disappointed in the fact that you really will not get a lot if you haven't read the book . But from what I am reading here on IMDb , the people who have read the book say that this film is a let down for them , so I'm kind of in a confused state more so now than when I finished this film . As for a family film ? This movie does have a little violence and scares here and there , but over all I think it's safe for the kids . Everything about this film except for the over the top story is decent , but maybe the sequel will make more sense , hopefully .
482167	1293485	325258	6.0	Being a child star rocks , it's being an ex child star that stinks	I'm going to be up front , I don't like David Spade , I was never much of a fan of his work . But one of the girls I work with mentioned how she saw this movie and that I should see it since I know so much about pop culture , including most child star actors and their history . So I decided to give Dickie Roberts : Former Child Star a chance , what did I have to loose ? I have to admit that I actually enjoyed this movie . It had definitely some of the most awesome cameo's that I have ever seen , like Corey Feldman , Dustin Diamond , Danny Bonnoduchi , Barry Williams , it was just awesome to see them playing poker together , that was the best scene . But the whole movie is pretty fun . Dickie Roberts is a former child star who's life has gone down hill since the sit com that made him a star got cancelled . He wants a comeback , but when the director , Rob Reiner , tells him that he needs a " normal " person , someone who has had a childhood , but Dickie wants the role so badly that he stays with a family to discover what he missed in his childhood . But he ends up with a lot more than he expected when this family may be all he needs . Dickie Roberts : Former Child Star is just a fun comedy with average acting , but a cool story . It was pretty unique and I just loved the ending credit sequence of the whole former child star actors singing about their memories and what it's like for them in today's world . Dickie Roberts : Former Child Star is a cute movie , some things are a bit unbelievable and the love story wasn't really needed , but it's a fun film and I would recommend it if you wanna just have a movie afternoon .
483647	1293485	295178	6.0	It's more of a blast from the past .	Here we are into the third installment of " Austin Powers " and sadly it is wearing thin . We don't have the same originality that the first one brought or the usually funny jokes . Now while the ideas were good and it seemed strong , it just didn't give . The beginning is classic and it seemed like this was going to be great . I mean , we have Tom Cruise playing Austin Powers , Kevin Spacey as Dr . Evil , John Travolta as Goldmember , and Danny Devito as Mini Me in the Austin Powers movie ! Just great and brilliant . But then the actual movie starts , Felicity is not here for no explained reason and Austin is single . Leading him to Foxxy Cleopatra , played by Beyonce and is way too stereotypical . Fat Bastard is also back and tries too hard with his disgusting jokes that fall flat . Dr . Evil is still pretty funny , but again just loosing his touch . We have a brilliant idea of Michael Caine as Austin's dad , but it's a hit and miss with Caine's dull performance . Goldmember , also played by Myers , is just too disgusting and tries too hard to impress the audience as another funny villain . Scott has now decided to take over the family business , which takes his cool and unique style away . : ( Mini Me is push aside then from Dr . Evil and he joins up with Austin to try again for that " shocking and ironic " laugh of him now being a Mini Austin . The ending is just ridicules . I'm sorry , this just didn't amuse me that much . The jokes were overused and not funny any more . There are too many stereotypical performances in here and the only thing worth watching is the beginning with the amazing cameo's . That was unforgettable , but the rest is just a skip . So , pass on this one , guys , it's not worth your time really . - and 4 points of that goes to the beginning !
483726	1293485	405469	6.0	The Lion King meets Madagascar	I have been dying to see The Wild , but I basically had to track it down since I couldn't find it at my lovely Hollywood Video store , lucky enough I found it at a little video store called Blockbuster . : P It just looked like a fun film and I unfortunately never got to see the movie in the theater , so I had to wait for the rental . Over all , I'd say that The Wild was a pretty good family film , but seemed like it could've been a better story . Samson and Ryan are the main attraction at the zoo , the lions ! Well , Ryan is a cub who is finding it very hard to find his great roar ! He wants to see what the wild is like from the stories his dad told him , one night he and his dad get into a big fight and Ryan , in anger , gets on a crate heading for the wild , but realizes he shouldn't have and ends up trapped . Samson and his group of friends head to the wild to find Ryan and end up discovering that they have no idea what they're doing ! I did like The Wild , and I know that it was made before Madagascar , but I think I liked Madagascar better , or at least it was funnier . But still , I wouldn't shy away from The Wild , it just could've been presented a little better I think . But it's a great cast , terrific animation , and in general a good family film .
482349	1293485	95271	6.0	Yes , ' tis true ! Michael is back ! And he wants revenge for his death ! Huh ?	After the failure that was the 3rd Halloween sequel , the writers knew that was mainly due to the absence of Michael Myers . So what did they do ? They invited Michael back in for the 4th sequel and back into the story of Halloween . Even though I did enjoy the 3rd sequel , I do agree that I missed Michael . He's my favorite boogeyman , so it'd be cool to see him return and do what he does best , slice and dice and scare the heck out of me . Well is this really scary ? Not too much , but still it's a fun sequel to get into and watch in the dark . I like the story and how they are continuing into the Myer's past and how far Michael will go to destroy this blood line . Although I was disappointed to not have Laurie Strode in this one , it was interesting to see how her legacy lives on with her daughter and now she will have the struggle with Michael Myers . Michael Myers has been in a coma for ten years , when his massacre was stopped by Dr . Samuel J . Loomis and Laurie Strode . Myers is being transferred from Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium to Smith's Grove Sanitarium . He awakens when he hears that Laurie Strode , his sister , is deceased , but her daughter , Jamie Lloyd is alive and well in Haddonfield . He kills the ambulance crew and escapes . Dr . Loomis races to Haddonfield in an attempt to bring Myers ' killing spree to an end once and for all . In Haddonfield , his niece Jamie Lloyd , has been adopted by the Carruthers family . She has frequent nightmares about Michael , though she does not know who he is . On Halloween night , Jamie goes out trick-or-treating dressed as a clown with her teenage foster sister Rachel . Her uncle , Michael , follows them . Meanwhile , Loomis arrives in Haddonfield after an exhausting journey , and contacts the police department to inform them of Myers ' escape . He and Haddonfield's new Sheriff Ben Meeker begin to search the town for Michael and Jamie . Myers has also blacked out the town's electricity by throwing a technician onto a electrical box and singlehandedly annihilated the entire police force . The girls barricade themselves in the Sheriff's house , while awaiting the arrival of the state police where Michael follows them and you'll have to see the movie to see the exciting conclusion . So over all Halloween 4 is a good sequel , it's not the strongest in the series , but it's one of the better stories of the franchise . I do like Jamie Lloyd , she was an interesting addition to the story and the writers are making these movies very interesting . I'm glad they brought Dr . Loomis back in , it brings us back into the original Halloween and he'll never give up until Michael Myers is gone for good , which we know is not going to happen since we still have 4 more sequels after this one . But the 4th installment into the Halloween franchise is a good one so I do recommend that you see it if you get the chance .
483044	1293485	455499	6.0	Cute and fun	I recently saw Garfield the movie and decided to go ahead and see what the sequel Garfield : A Tail of Two Kitties was about . These movies are so short , what do I have to loose , right ? Well I watched Garfield 2 yesterday and actually it was a pretty cute movie , from what I was expecting , I thought this was just a fun family film . Again , we do deal with the CGI , but for what this movie was , it had a cute story and fun characters . I'm kinda wondering though , what was the purpose of this sequel ? It's one of those " was this for the money or for the kids " movies . But I have to admit that this still had some fun laughs and cute moments , I'm such a sucker for the dogs , like Odie . But this movie felt more like a straight to DVD release than an actually theater movie . Jon wants to propose to his girlfriend , Liz , Garfield is so not in the mood to loose Jon to another life just when he got used to Odie . But Liz has to go to London for a convention , Jon thinks it would be the perfect idea to go and surprise her over there and propose . Garfield and Odie sneak with Jon and take the vacation too . But when a cat , Prince , who looks exactly like Garfield , is thrown away into the streets by Dargis , who wants Prince's castle that he inherited , Garfield is mistaken for Prince and taken back to the castle to live the high life and just party . Prince is mistaken for Garfield and lives the lower but the funnest life of lasagna and laziness . Garfield : A Tail of Two Kitties isn't a bad movie by any means , I think this is the perfect family film where it's great for the kids and even the adults will get a few laughs . I mentioned before in my Garfield comment that these movies did defeat the whole purpose of the original cartoon , but I guess I'll have to give up because you know we will see these movies again where they'll take our favorite childhood cartoon and turn it into CGI madness , maybe Woody Woodpecker will be next , who knows ? But anyways , Garfield : A Tail of Two Kitties is decent enough for the watch , but one watch is enough I'd say .
483653	1293485	408790	6.0	An above average thriller	Imagine , your child is lost on a plan that no one has seen , and now you hear that your child died back home and you're just possibly crazy . Have you really lost your child or are you simply mad ? OK , I know that's silly to say , but that is Flightplan in a nut shell . It's a good action thriller movie that is pretty well paced and is somewhat inspiring to never give up when you know your senses . But this movie did have it's flaws and overdoing's on explosions . It also had it's stereotypes and were just a little bit too much when it was not needed . I mean , over all , I would recommend Flightplan for a watch , but only if you enjoy these types of thrillers . It's a decent flick that keeps you guessing after all .
482447	1293485	465940	6.0	Let's do the time warp again	Recently they've been advertising that Cinderella III : A Twist in Time along with the other Cinderella movies are going back into the " Disney Vault " . I never wanted to see the sequels of Cinderella before , but do to the wonderful world of subliminal messages , I broke down and decided to rent the sequels . I watched Cinderella 3 yesterday and even though it was kinda weird , I don't think it was a continuation of the second Cinderella movie , it was pretty cute and a wonderful children's movie . The animation was a big improvement from the second Cinderella , it was a lot more bright and fun to watch . The story was a pretty clever idea , it was nice to see what happened to the wicked step mother and Cinderella's ugly step sisters . Cinderella and her prince are just living happily ever after , nothing could be more perfect in her life . But when we visit the step mother and her greedy daughters who are living Cinderella's former life of yucky chores , but when one of the daughters , Anastasia , she sees the fairy god mother and steals her wand . The step mother thinks it's time for revenge on Cinderella and turns back time with the wand . Now it seems that the prince wants to marry Anastasia , and Cinderella gets squat . But when the mice find out about what the step mom did , they are going to make sure things get set back right with Cinderella and her prince charming . Cinderella III : A Twist in Time is pretty fun to watch , it has a good story , fun songs , and just makes you go " Aww " , all the ingredients to a decent Disney movie . As we know that many Disney sequels don't really work that well , normally since they're released straight to video or DVD , they're low budget and not that fun . Even though Cinderella III : A Twist in Time isn't up to Cinderella's original magic , it's still a fun little movie that I'd recommend for any child .
482730	1293485	161081	6.0	Left with questions , but it's an effective thriller	I remember in 2000 seeing some of What Lies Beneath , but I never got to finish it , so I figured I would rent the movie recently . I just watched it last night and I have to say that actually this movie sent chills down my spine , I was really impressed with how intense it was . Michelle and Harrison were absolutely perfect for these roles , I couldn't imagine anyone else in their parts . My only problem with the film though was some of the questions were left unexplained , like the bloody shoe next door and how quickly the situation of Michelle's husband's situation was with the girl that was haunting her , but when you see the film , you'll see what I mean . Claire and Norman have just moved into a new home where their daughter has gone off to college and they are all alone . They seem like an extremely loving couple and that they have everything under control . But things get scary when Claire starts to hear voices and see ghostly images around the house . Norman thinks she's crazy of course , Claire first suspects her neighbor of murdering his wife , but then she realizes she is wrong and that her husband has a deadly secret that he's kept from her and now it's after her . What Lies Beneath was a great thriller and is a guarantee chill if you watch it at night with the lights turned off . The acting was great and the atmosphere was perfect , the director really had the feel of the film and what it should of been . Just the script needed more work I think , it just left me with some questions , I don't mind usually that much about that stuff , but with this film I felt it was kind of important . Not to mention I didn't like the ending with the computer effects , but I'm letting that go . Over all , I would recommend it , it's a scary thriller , but be prepared for unanswered questions .
483613	1293485	139414	6.0	It's pretty good	I wasn't too highly interesting in seeing " Lake Placcid " . But one time it was on HBO , and I had nothing better to do . I watched it and I was a little surprised . It wasn't all that bad . A few cheesy effects , but for the most part effective for what it is . And considering that allegators scare the heck out of me , it helped my review a little . As for the plot , I wasn't to into it . When it comes to sea monster movies , I'll take " Jaws " any day . But , I was really tensed up when one of the guys is in the water and he looks behind him and he is faced with the crocedile . And they just have this staring contest , like who has the most fear ? Over all , I'd recommend if you're just looking for a good scare .
482080	1293485	430912	6.0	It really wasn't all that bad as long as you're not expecting the first movie's excellence	Despite some pretty poor reviews of Basic Instinct 2 , I figured that since I loved the first Basic Instinct , to give the second one a chance . I love Sharon Stone and she was so beautiful and dangerous in the first movie , why not give the sequel a chance ? While it felt just like the first plot did , I thought it was actually over all a good mind f word thriller . I thought the acting wasn't too bad and the story worked , although I have to admit the psychiatrist screaming at the end was a little over the top , but it was a fun movie to watch . Catherine is back and while her and an athlete are in a car getting stoned and having sex , they crash and Catherine gets out in time , but the athlete does not . Catherine is under investigation for murder of the athlete , but since there is not enough evidence for the investigation , so she goes to a psychiatrist , Dr . Glass . But soon he finds himself being seduced into Catherine's world of sex , drugs , and murder , and he's starting to like it ! Basic Instinct 2 is a pretty good thriller and I think people were expecting too much , or at least what the first Basic Instinct was , but believe me , on it's own , the sequel is a fair story that deserves a little more praise . Come on , I know IMDb users have seen a lot worse , and it's Sharon Stone ! How could you hate Sharon ? That excludes Catwoman , but still !
482837	1293485	80365	6.0	What's with the leading male name ?	" Julian " ? " Julian " ? So , I have heard so much about " American Gigilo " being a sexy movie and it was , don't get me wrong . But then I heard the name " Julie " being said to Richard Gere . Couldn't it have been a more manly , sexy name like : Lance , Dick , or Hermes ? : D OK , just kidding . Over all , " American Gigilo " isn't a bad movie . It's kind of a landmark in the history of film . One of the first major prostitute films . It's kind of interesting to see Richard Gere as the prostitute in this film before " Pretty Woman " . Do you people find it a bit ironic ? : D I did kind of enjoy the movie . That acting was OK and the story over all was alright . But there were a lot of clique's in the film . You can tell that it is pretty well dated . But actually , I think I'd might recommend this film for a watch . Adults only ! Because it is an interesting film and it has a good love story that I think the ladies will enjoy and some action that the guys will like .
482488	1293485	120434	6.0	Back on the old Holiday Road	Actually and surprisingly , I did like " Vegas Vacation " over all . It has brought us back to the old Vacation . You have to admit that was a very cool cameo of Christie Brinkley . OK , Rusty and Audrey have changed quite a bit , that's why everyone has to love the line " The kids have grown up so much I don't even recognize them anymore " . LOL . Rusty has become a gambling lord in Las Vegas , while somehow Audrey has become a sexy stripper that was a bit disturbing . Ellen has been smittened by Wayne Newton and he has seduced her into his crazy world of entertainment , gambling , sex , money , and Sigfreid and Roy . : D And Clark has become a gambelholic and has managed to loose all of the family's money . Eddie has come back , but he's not as entertaining as in " Vacation " or " Christmas Vacation " . His welcome did wear out . Over all this is a good movie for some laughs . I wouldn't really recommend it unless you did love the " Vacation " movies . Otherwise just stick to " Vacation " and " Christmas Vacation " .
482717	1293485	85636	6.0	Misunderstood and under rated	This is probably the most controversial Halloween movie , simply because Michael Myers isn't in it . I know that this movie gets a lot of complaints , but actually I can see where the writers were going with this . They just had an idea to continue the Halloween stories , but just to do a different type of franchise , which I give them a lot of credit for . Does this movie deliver the same scares as the original Halloween or even the sequel ? No , it doesn't , but it's still creepy and not given a proper chance by most . Just the song that is used alone in this movie was a bit intense . It's a great little ghost story that is sure to deliver chills if you have an open mind to it . The acting isn't as good as the other movies , we have some pretty below par actors , but over all they make the movie worth watching even if it was cheesy . On Saturday , October 23 , shop owner Harry Grimbridge is chased by mysterious figures wearing business suits . He collapses at a gas station clutching a Silver Shamrock jack-o'-lantern mask and is driven to the hospital by the filling station attendant all the while ranting , " They're gonna kill us . All of us . " While Grimbridge is hospitalized , another man in a suit enters his room and pulls his skull apart . The man then returns to his vehicle , douses himself with gasoline and lights himself on fire , causing the car to explode . Challis , together with Grimbridge's daughter , Ellie , begins an investigation that leads them to the home of the Silver Shamrock Novelties factory . They learn from a hotel manager , Mr . Rafferty , that the source of the town's prosperity is Irishman Conal Cochran and his factory and that the majority of the town's population is made up of descendants of Irish immigrants . Challis learns that Ellie's father had stayed at the same hotel . Other guests of the hotel included shop owners Marge Guttman , Buddy , Betty and their son " Little " Buddy . All have business at the factory and eventually meet gruesome ends because of the Silver Shamrock masks . The Kupfer family views the Silver Shamrock commercial that will air on Halloween night . But there's more to these masks then meets the eye . Is Halloween 3 the best sequel ? No ; is it the worst sequel ? No ; I'd say just a lot of people got the wrong idea about the movie and didn't know what the writers were thinking when the wrote for this franchise . I loved the ending scene , it actually did give me a nightmare , I don't want to give it away though , just trust me , it's a creepy scene . I do recommend if you love horror movies to give this movie a fair chance or if you want to see the Halloween movie franchise , just remember that the writers just wanted to try something new . I do honestly like this movie , I hope people will see it for what it is and it's just a good ghost story to watch on a night for Halloween .
483189	1293485	439815	7.0	Good gory fun !	I really didn't have an interest in seeing Slither when it was released in the theater , it just looked too cheesy and like a bad film for horror . But recently , I have been hearing more and more about Sliter , how much of a cult classic it's becoming and how many fans there are . Not to mention that it has a decent rating on IMDb , so I decided to wait for the rental . Slither reminded me of The Blob meets Squirm , only it had a great mix of horror and comedy . Sliter is about a meteor that hits the Earth and Grant and his mistress happen to be right next to it , and Grant gets attacked by one of the creatures that appear to be slug like and turns him into a giant slimy slug ! This slug impregnates a female human causing her to become this giant ball like slug carrying . . . thing ! She explodes causing over billions of slugs to get into the human's mouths and makes them into zombies ! Slither is cheesy , but it's the good kind that has a great reminder of the B-movies from the 80's . That's what was so clever about it , not to mention the great and funny dialog that seemed so natural and reminded me of Shaun of the Dead . " For better or worse ! " the wife says to Grant seeing him as the giant slug . I really enjoyed watching Slither , it's a great treat for horror fans !
482733	1293485	83929	7.0	The Original Teen Sex Comedy	Fast Times at Ridgemont High is one of those films , even if it was made before you were born , you have heard of it in some way . It is so referenced to society and some of it's scenes are legendary . I was watching I love the 80's and they showed some pretty funny clips , so it was always on my mind to give this movie a look . I finally remembered to rent it at Hollywood Video and watched it last night . Although I'm not sure I laughed as much as others would have , I still liked this film for some reason . Just because I think in one way or another you could relate to it and remember how hard it was being a teenager . We have Stacey and Linda , two hot young high school students who are very sex deprived and look to make this year their best ever . Mike who is chasing after Stacy and looking to have a meaningful relationship with her . Brad , a senior who is looking to make his last year the best but plans turn out to be different when everything turns on him . Then of course we have Jeff Spacolli , the stoner surfer dude who manages to finally let a teacher , Mr . Hand , have his own . Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a classic teen comedy that I would highly recommend . It is all in good fun and was just so much fun to watch . The cast looked like they had so much fun and the movie just looked like a blast to make . It's understandable on why this film's legacy lives on , this was the movie to watch before American Pie and it's always a joy to stick to the original , trust me . Even though this film had it's stupid moments , I gotta admit I couldn't help but laugh at Spacolli's line " What's that noise ? " . . . " It's my skull ! " , we're proud of you , Sean .
482019	1293485	420683	7.0	I'd rather watch this than " The Wedding Planner "	I'm a fan of Denise Richards , I admit . I think she is incredibly beautiful and has the potential for being a great actress . Again , I rented this movie from Hollywood Video , I couldn't help myself , I think it's that female magnet thing in my head . : D But seriously , I thought that this was an adorable film that anyone could enjoy . True , mostly girls . But it was still fun . I didn't realize that this was a made for TV movie , but still it was a good little film . Denise Richards plays a wedding planner who has a mean boss and a client who is a brat . When she meets a hunky fire fighter played by Dean Caine , she is in love . He is interested as well , but she thinks that's her client's fiancée . But when she finds out that he isn't and it's his brother's fiancée , they start a steamy relationship , but then she finds out that the fiancée is sleeping with a certain family member . Can she still trust him and hope her heart doesn't get broken ? You'll have to find out that one for yourself . This is a cute movie to watch with the girls and I'll admit 100 % that I enjoyed this film as well .
483174	1293485	83866	7.0	A little too sappy for my tastes	I've watched quit a few movies that made me sob . But " E . T . " is a little extreme . It's a great movie , and there are some great actors . The plot is very touching . Steven Speilberg is practically the " boss " of directing . He knows what he is doing and he does it well . He has a vision that makes everyone smile . He's brilliant . But this time he went a little far . In fact , I am almost crying writing a comment on the movie becaue I am thinking about the ending . I'm sorry , I just can't say this is the best movie . It's way too sad for me . But I will say that it was a great movie if anything . I would recommend for youngsters though .
482785	1293485	470705	7.0	This movie is really starting to BUG me	OK , cheesy joke , I know , but actually the movie really did get to me . I picked up this movie at Hollywood Video , I was pretty curious on what it was , if it was a thriller , horror movie , or drama , it's pretty much a mix of all . But also William Friedkin had directed the film , William isn't just the director of The Exorcist , he's an incredible director who has many works of art under his belt . So I rented Bug and watched it last night and I have to say that this was an incredibly disturbing psychological thriller that really freaked me out . I mean , these performances were absolutely amazing , most people are raving about Ashley Judd's performance , but what about Michael Shannon ? In my opinion , he had the best performance , he was so intense and he really draws you into the scene and the story . Agnes is a woman who is pretty much on her own , she lives in a cruddy little motel , has an abusive boyfriend who is out of jail and won't leave her alone , and also lost a son a while back in a grocery store . She's also a drug addict . When her friend , R . C . , brings her friend , Peter to Agnes's house , Peter and Agnes pretty much click from the get go , but when Peter tries to get away from Agnes , he confesses the reason why , that he was part of an army experiment and he's escaped . She asks him to stay anyways , that she's so lonely , and he does , but soon they have delusions of a bug infestation and start destroying each other over something that they swear they can see and is watching them . The story is so beyond intense , I couldn't believe how much this film got to me . Especially when they reveal the ultimate damage that Peter does to his own character , it sent shivers down my spine . Ashley , Michael , and Harry all brought in great performances and really made this story incredibly interesting and scary to watch . The whole ending was beautifully shot by Friedkin , I was a little disappointed with how quickly it did end , but thinking about it , I'm not sure if there could have been a better ending , but you'll have to see what I mean when you watch it . I would recommend this film , I don't think many users are understanding what it's about or are just focusing on the wrong things here , but this movie I warn you is not for the faint of heart .
483322	1293485	57012	7.0	Not as funny as I expected , but still I can appreciate and love this awesome film	Dr . Strangelove has to be one of the most referenced movies of all time . When I saw this movie , I could say a million parodies I have seen in my life that I now know were based on this movie . Also , I saw 100 funniest movies on Bravo , this was ranked pretty high . Not to mention this is a highly rated movie on IMDb , in fact at # 19 on the top 250 , I mean a person would have to be stupid not to check this film out after all you find out about it . I did understand the " Funny Scenes " , if that's what you could call it . I loved the colonel and Peter Sellers fighting back and refusing not to surrender . George C . Scott was hilarious . Although I'm not sure where I get these comments on how this is the funniest movie and Stanley's best . Sadly , I'm not a fan of Stanley's , so that's where I can agree , this is his best , but only by my standards . It was a funny movie , but I never laughed out loud . Well , I'm not sure what else to say , but I guess I'll never understand some top 250 films .
481974	1293485	130827	7.0	Fast paced and action packed !	I have just heard so much about Run , Lola , Run or Lola Rennt as it is pronounced in Germany . I heard about it on I love the 90's , my 1001 movies you must see before you die book , and the Simpsons did a parody of it . I always pass the foreign film section at my video store , but something just told me to check it out real quick to see maybe if there was a film that looked interesting and I saw Run Lola Run and just grabbed it . Now , while I'm still confused about how this movie is on the top 250 on IMDb , I still found it to be very entertaining and an interesting way of making film . Lola gets a phone call from her boyfriend who lost a sack of one hundred thousand dollars ( American ) and the mobsters he was supposed to deliver it too are going to come and kill him if he doesn't have the money with him . Lola has 20 minutes to get a hundred thousand dollars , in three scenario's , the director gives us different ways of seeing this story and also some different endings that keep us going and wondering what might happen next . I would say that maybe because I am very used to American film making , maybe I just didn't get it as much as others to where I would give it a ten on the rating system . But it's all good , I still did enjoy the movie , it had great action and kept me going into a different ending three times ! I would recommend it for fun , it had decent acting and a very interesting way of making film , like music video styles and a bit of Japnamation , but I'm still not sure if this is one of the greatest movies of all time , you know ?
482311	1293485	78346	7.0	A treasure from the 70's and an inspiration for future comic book / super hero movies	Is it cheesy ? Yes ! Is it cliché ? Oh , yes ! But this was so original for it's time and the effects were astonishing ! While it is very corny and goes over the top with the cliché hero / villain relationship , Superman is just a fun little movie to watch . Despite that I'm still digging Batman even more , but Superman is cool to watch too . : D I had heard that there was a new Superman movie coming out and I had not seen the original Superman movie in a while , so I figured I should re watch before seeing the new one . Comic book nerds , I know they'll love this movie ! : D No offense to those who are ! Remember , you'll be the rich one's in the future ! But in general , I think anyone can enjoy this fun and optimistic super hero movie !
482990	1293485	338751	7.0	Visually stunning ; but Martin's best work and best picture ? No .	See , at the Oscars , despite the fact that I had not seen " The Aviator " , I was cheering for it . Because I am a huge Martin Scorsesse fan and I only saw two other movies that were nominated . Leonardo without a doubt has become a very fine actor , and the clip they showed for his nomination of " Best Actor " looked extremely interesting . So , when it came to best picture I was all for " The Aviator " or " Finding Neverland " , but then " Million Dollar Baby " took it and I was upset . Still , I had to see " The Aviator " . While the movie has a very stunning atmosphere and fine actors that can steal the scene , it's not a very interesting story . Howard Hughs , no , I do not know that much about him . In fact , I didn't realize what he really did until I saw this movie . But he just seemed like any ordinary a-hole in life . The movie could have been something spectacular , but the person and story just didn't interest me . So , I'm so sorry Martin , you were not handed anything that could have been gold . This was the problem , because it was too long and the main character wasn't that interesting , you loose track of the film . Otherwise , this is a good all around film to watch for a Saturday . Is it a watch ? Oh , yes . 2 hours and 45 minutes of Leo is a little much to handle . But I would recommend it to see good flick , but that's all it is . Just a good flick . - To Martin : We know you can do better !
482591	1293485	179182	7.0	So so close to being a great film	I have to admit , I was looking for a romance movie . Why ? I'm not sure . I have to figure it out first . Getting onto the movie , I was in the mood for this type of genre , so maybe that's why I kinda liked it . Joseph Fiennes , I have been seeing him quite often now . I have now seen 4 of his movies , and he is very sexy , I give him that . But he gets practically the same role in every film that I've seen him in . What's with the cheating on his spouse or making the girl leave her boyfriend for him ? I . . . I . . . ah , well ! In some ways I can see a girl leaving their ex behind for him . He does do a great job in the film . Ray Liotta , what a great bad guy ! I've probably seen him in about 4 or 5 films , among one of my favorites " Goodfellas " . He's an excellent actor who is very under rated . The problem is , again , stereotyping . He's always the villain . Even though he is a very good one at that , I'd like to see him in a different role . But his acting in here , more mob than insanely jealous husband . That girl , sorry , don't remember her name , she wasn't too bad . But she wasn't too convincing . In some ways the passion lacked a little on her side , she could've put more into being tossed between her husband and the man she truly loves . The story is actually very good . Even though not original , I wouldn't actually mind buying the film for a good price . It's nothing special , but it's a decent flick I would recommend . - Almost there .
483233	1293485	443536	7.0	Never trust a bunny !	I was just walking down the isle at Blockbuster Video and noticed " Hoodwinked ! " , I really got into the animation videos this year , so I figured to give it a shot and I have to say that I'm glad that I did . Hoodwinked is a really good and funny movie , it took the most simple childhood story of " Little Red Riding Hood " and turned it into a great animated twist on the story . Who ever knew that the wolf or granny had a different side of the story , right ? Well , that's what Hoodwinked is about . Little Red Riding Hood is on her way to see her Granny , who also happens to be famous for her sweets , and of course , she gets a big surprise by the Big Bad Wolf . But instead of the way the typical story goes , the police arrest all of these suspects wondering what happened , and we go through each of their stories , and they all just happen to meet . But there's a big twist when we find out that there is more than meets the eye to this typical story . Even though this wasn't the best animated film I have seen , I loved Hoodwinked ! It had a great script and was a great family film that anyone could enjoy . My only thing was that this movie had quite the cast , but you really couldn't tell who's voice was who's , which makes me think that they used computers , which isn't impressive . But I would always highly recommend Hoodwinked , especially just to see that cute little Twitchy .
483080	1293485	455824	7.0	Big and grand , but not the hit they were aiming for	OK , I saw Australia back in December , so I'm a little rusty , forgive the late review . But looking back on this movie and just thinking about it really did help me in looking at the film and it's story . Australia was a movie that really tried to be the next Gone With The Wind for the millennium's audience . While it's a good movie , it definitely wasn't great and went way over the top . It's a little lengthy in the time and the writing was a little over done , BUT nevertheless it was still a good movie . It had terrific sets and was a beautiful setting , it felt like watching one of the old classic movies that made you feel good . Well , it was kinda like Titanic with the emotions , you were up , you were down , you were laughing , you were crying , well you get the idea . The story is a bit much , so I'm going to do the best I can to give you a decent summary . In 1939 , Lady Sarah Ashley travels from England to northern Australia to force her philandering husband to sell his faltering Australian cattle station , Faraway Downs . Her husband sends an independent cattle drover , called simply " Drover " , to Darwin to transport her to Faraway Downs . Lady Sarah's husband , who has been working hard to sell 1500 head of cattle to the military , is murdered shortly before she arrives . Meanwhile , treacherous FD cattle station manager Neil Fletcher is trying to gain control of Faraway Downs , so that neighboring Lesley ' King ' Carney can have a cattle monopoly in the Northern Territory , which will give him negotiating leverage with the Australian army . The childless Lady Sarah is captivated by the young boy Nullah , who was born to an Aboriginal mother and an unknown white father . When Nullah and his mother hide from the white authorities by entering a water tower , his mother drowns . Drover is friendly with the Aborigines , and therefore shunned by many of the other whites in the territory . Lady Sarah and Drover develop a romance , and she gains a new appreciation for the Australian territory . But Carney's men poison all the water sources along the cattle-drive route , so the group risks driving the cattle through the dangerous Never Never desert , which they accomplish with the help of " King George " . Two years later , Drover and Lady Sarah have lived together with Nulla . But Drover , who has been quarreling with Lady Sarah and has gone droving apparently never to return , hears that she has been killed in the bombing of Darwin . Drover finds out about Nullah's abduction to Mission Island , and sets out with Magarri and Ivan to rescue Nullah and the other children from the island using a sailboat . Whew , OK , I hope that summary is a good description of the movie since I haven't watched in a while , but I did the best I could . So in a quick sum up , the movie is worth the watch , for the background , it was worth watching in the theater . But you get the same effect if you watched it at home if you have a big screen TV and surround sound . Nicole and Hugh were a beautiful couple together , they did the best they could for such a lengthy story . But the chemistry was on and the movie did work , I think they just went a little too over the top on trying to make this movie into a classic or some kind of love fest for the Oscars . It's worth the watch , but I'd recommend just watching it at home , I don't think I can sit through a 3 hour movie again in the theaters , I'm really loosing my touch .
482954	1293485	89908	7.0	A little strange , but I like it	This is such a dark Disney movie . I was a little surprised by it . But I actually enjoyed it . POSSIBLE SPOILERSDorothy is back from Oz . And no one believes her story . They think she's gone mad . When she finds a key back to Oz , she goes back . Finding that the land has changed . It's lifeless . She gets some new friends . And the journey continues .
482844	1293485	215750	7.0	It is a very good movie , but just a little slow paced	OK , OK , I have to be honest . I've seen " Killing Me Softly " and " Forever Mine " and I have a little crush on Joesph Fiennes . And just recently , I got my best friend hooked on him as well . So , we were looking for a good movie and on IMDb , a person recommended this as a good J . F . flick . My friend and looked at the rating and it did say " some sexuality " for it's Rated R ! We were excited , Joe does have a cute butt after all . : D So , I watched this movie first just looking for a good insert word that shouldn't be inserted scene . I was disappointed ! I watched it a second time trying to except that there was no Joesph booty in the film . The second time , I actually kind of enjoyed it . It was very sad and showed the Russian struggles during WWII . They endured a lot of heart ache and sadness . The acting and directing was above average . I would recommend for a good war flick not a booty flick unfortunately . : (
482531	1293485	95270	8.0	A guilty pleasure that I'm sure will become your's as well when you see it	I heard a little bit about Hairspray , kinda like maybe it was an underground classic , some have heard of it , some haven't , but I just watched it over the weekend to find to surprise that it was directed by John Waters and starred Divine , I just recently viewed . . . sigh . . . Pink Flamingos , so I had no idea as to what to expect from this movie . But I'd have to say it was a real pleasure to watch , as silly of a story as it was , it worked . In today's world , big girls are not really as well excepted , Ricki Lake took on that role as Tracy and made it OK to be big and beautiful . She plays Tracy Turnbird , a plump teenage girl who is a huge fan of a dance show called the Corny Collins show , she and her friend go onto the show and Tracy quickly jumps in to become one of the favorite dancers , in fact even more popular than her thinner rivals . But Tracy wins everyone's heart including her family and the love of the public as she goes to prove that big girls don't cry . . . that and you can never have hair that doesn't stand up high enough . . . you'll get that when you see the movie . Hairspray is a good movie , it had decent acting and a cute story that I'm sure that anyone could enjoy . So please do give it a look , I'm sure I'll see it again down the road , I told my friends about it and they are actually interested in seeing it , so goes to show you that the film might be still remembered for a few more decades to come , especially since it's being remade I just noticed , oi , Hollywood , can't you come up with something original ?
483275	1293485	481536	8.0	Donuts are awesome !	I am getting so addicted to Harold and Kumar's crazy adventures , it's just pathetic , when I saw Harold and Kumar go to White Castle , I was hooked and bought the movie the next day . So obviously I was so excited to see Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay , saw it opening day and it's non stop laughs still ! Now , I do hate gross humor , it's disgusting and unoriginal , yet , somehow , Harold and Kumar make it so unbelievably funny . They're back and this time they are taking the world by storm ! Kal Penn and John Cho are such a great pair and made this sequel so much fun to watch . I agree , it does get offensive at times , but if you don't take this movie seriously , I think you'll be laughing too . Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay is one of the funniest movies I have seen this year in the theater . Harold and Kumar are on their way to Amsterdam to visit Harold's love , Maria , but of course , Kumar just can't wait until they get to Amsterdam , so he smokes on a plane , but everyone mistakes the bong for a bomb and Harold and Kumar get thrown into Guantanamo Bay . When they have the chance , they take it . When they finally arrive back in America , they got to meet Kumar's ex girlfriend's fiancée who could pull some strings to get their charges clear , but the way to Texas is a long road and they have to face some interesting obstacles . Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay was so much fun to watch , I loved this sequel , the cast looked like they had the ultimate blast making this film . The scenes that got huge laughs from me was when the FBI agent offers grape soda to a guy to get information about where Harold and Kumar were , and some guy in the back round says " How about some Kool Aid ? ! " , also the scene with the return of the weed bag with Kumar and his ex girlfriend was so weird , that it was actually funny . If you loved Harold & Kumar go to White Castle , you'll love Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay , it's a comedy not to miss .
483571	1293485	113228	8.0	Still having a good ol ' time !	I rented both Grumpy Old Men and Grumpier Old Men back to back , so I could see both instead of my normal rent one sequel at a time ordeal . I just finished Grumpier Old Men this morning and was expecting a modest sequel , but it turned into a great sequel , pretty much to the point where I enjoyed Grumpier Old Men to Grumpy Old Men . Despite the fact that they use some old jokes , this was a fun plot and I thought the guys have gotten even funnier , including John's father , he's a little dirty , but so much fun to laugh at . John and Max are now best friends again and couldn't be happier with each other , their son and daughter are about to get hitched , and they are overwhelming with the wedding plans . Max is starting to get lonely though , since Chuck has passed on , the bait shop is given to two older Italian women , one lady , Maria , starts a little feud with Max wanting to turn the bait shop into a restaurant . But their anger turns into a hidden passion and they end up falling head over heals for each other , but Maria has some hidden skeletons in her closet . Grumpier Old Men is proof that you are never too old to fall in love or have your heart broken again . It was so sweet seeing Max fall in love with Maria , I loved their passion for each other , it was so fun to watch . John's father and Maria's mother were just so awesome and funny , they had such great chemistry ! I would highly recommend Grumpier Old Men , it's a great comedy that once again touches your heart and tickles your funny bone .
482002	1293485	175142	8.0	Just a great time ! I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard .	I always did love watching " Scary Movie " , I'm not really sure why . I think when I just need a good laugh and a movie that doesn't require brains , I love to watch parodies . " Scary Movie " captured that very well with " Scream " , " I know what you did last Summer " , " The Sixth Sense " , " Scream 2 " , etc . You are guaranteed to have some really great laughs with " Scary Movie " . The cast , you can tell , they had so much fun making this movie and it shows . I just loved the scene where they had hit the man on the road making fun of " I know what you did last summer " , and Elizabeth Berkley can't find the body but she sees a bloody boot like Jennifer Love Hewitt did in that scene , but instead says " Oh , my God ! We hit a boot ! " . I know that sounds stupid , but it gave me such a good laugh . It has an amusing ending of making fun of The Usually Suspects with Doofy . No , this movie is not for everyone . It does have very crude and sexual humor , but like I said , sometimes when you just wanna let go and have fun , you just can make any movie into a good one . Except for Pooty Tang . : D But I'd recommend this for a good laugh and for a fun time with your friends .
483720	1293485	51622	8.0	It's a bad day to be a fly	The Fly is a movie I have just been dying to see , I have heard a lot about this movie , mainly the infamous " Help me ! Help me ! " scene . But of course the number one reason being that this is the original to the remake with Jeff Goldblum which is an incredible movie in itself , but I was curious what the original would be about . Honestly I was thinking that it was going to be very cheesy , it's a 1950's horror movie that would probably be over the top , but honestly , from the very beginning you get gore , which was odd , but sickly enough I love it ! I am also a huge Vincent Price fan , this is the man of the classic B horror movies and his voice and presence make these movies worth the watch . So I finally got to see this on netflix , I absolutely loved The Fly . Is this better than the remake ? Honestly , the remake is more realistic on what would happen if this really did occur , but don't overlook the original , as cheesy as a fly in a giant trench coat can be , it's all good and this story is tons of fun and really scary . A woman named Helene Delembre phones her brother-in-law , Francois Delambre to tell him that she has just murdered her husband . Francois calls in the police and she admits killing him but refuses to say why . Later , Francois tricks her into telling the story to him and Police Inspector Charas . A scientist , Andre Delambre , has invented a teleportation device . After a few failed attempts , he succeeds with living organisms , deciding to go for the ultimate risk and transport himself . The first time works , but , unknown to him , a fly enters the cabin with him and the two are hopelessly scrambled together . The scientist emerges as a half-man , half-fly , a human with a fly's head , leg and arm / claw . His wife finds out something is wrong as she now sees him with a cloth over his head and a hidden arm . He eventually tells his wife what has happened and she first sees his claw and screams , then later sees his fly head and screams more . His wife , son and maid try to find the " fly with a white head " and fail . The son had caught it just after the accident but had been made to let it go , before any of them knew what it was . Andre attempts to reverse the process to return himself to normal , but fails and when he realizes that his mind is being overtaken by that of the fly he asks his wife to end his suffering by killing him with a heavy machine press . The Fly is a fantastic and thrilling movie . I know that the ending sequence of " Help me ! Help me ! " was cheesy and over the top to some , but to me it was just plain creepy , it really scared me . The whole atmosphere of the film just felt uncomfortable and disturbing . Granted , I know these were not top of the line make up effects with the fly , I do have to laugh juts a little bit with seeing a fly in a trench coat . But still it was effective and made for a great sci-fi story . I love these old movies for a specific reason , this was the time when film meant something to the cast and crew making it and The Fly was made to give people the chills . It's just rare now-a-days , if this was made in today's world , it would be all gore and just stupid . So I do recommend that you see this film if you are looking for a good scare . Both this and the remake are terrific films and are a ton of fun to watch .
482411	1293485	218922	8.0	It's not that bad	I wasn't too into the movie , but I have to admit I was intrigued . I really loved the plot . And how Antonio's character becomes so passionatly in love with Angelina's character . I'm not sure if I would watch it more then a few times . But it's worth another look .
482321	1293485	218839	8.0	Just great !	You know , this movie reminded me so much of so many people I know , I think that's the reason why I loved this movie so much . I was just on the floor laughing because this had such a serious and document feel to it , but the dialog is so hilarious , that you can't help but have a good time . Basically the movie is about these crazed dog owners who are competing in a big dog show to see who is the best of the best . Whlie it seems like it should be the dogs who take this competition seriously , it turns out the owners are just as insane . Megan , one of the dog owners , goes almost serial psycho killer on the hotel manager because she cannot find the special bee squeaky toy for her dog . There is another couple that is just great , Gerry and Cookie , this complete nerd and attractive woman that are just so lovable . In the beginning of the movie , Gerry describes how many boyfriends Cookie had . Throughout the movie , her " lovers " see her and hit on her even in front of Gerry ! It was just great and fun to watch Gerry's looks . This whole movie is just a hoot , and you can't stop with the recognizable faces that keep popping up . It's a great movie is just fun to watch , I'd highly recommend it ! Now , I have to find a nice way of showing this to my friends who are like these couples to see the mirror image of themselves . :
482342	1293485	404390	8.0	Scared the heck out of me	Running Scared is a terrifying and dark action movie about a man , Joey , who is being slowly betrayed by the mob he works for . When they tell him to hide a gun that could put them away for years , he does so , but he doesn't realize that his son and his friend see where he keeps the gun , Oleg , his son's friend , takes the gun and shoots his abusive step father . Obviously , police and the FBI are involved and if the figure out the gun is Joey's . One problem , Oleg has run away from home facing some pretty horrific things out in the city . Joey , his wife , and his son together try to find Oleg and instead find out some more interesting information instead . Running Scared was an extremely scary movie in my opinion and one of the most intense I've seen in my life . I would recommend if you like those on your seat edgy thrillers .
481964	1293485	366548	8.0	Footloose , Penguin Style !	When Happy Feet took the Oscar for best animated film of 2006 , I became extremely interested in seeing this movie . But I kept on hearing that this didn't deserve the Oscar , so I was a little scarred about seeing it , but I figured , everyone has a different opinion of what deserves what award and such . So I rented it anyways and I watched it last night , I have to say that this was such an adorable film and so much fun , why all the mean reviews ? It had great animation , fun songs , and an adorable story that I'm sure anyone could enjoy . On the Emporer Penguins Island , they are known for singing , not only that , but they are terrific at it , but when Mumble is born , he's a bit different , instead of being a singer , he's more of a dancer . But no one is buying it , in fact he is even sent away from the island , but he meets several penguins who are also outcasts . But there is also a bigger problem , the fish population is winding down when humans keep taking them , the penguins are starving and Mumble will try to use his tap dancing skills to communicate and save the island that has isolated him away from his friends and family . Happy Feet is all in good fun , I think people really should give it another chance . Out of Cars and Monster House , I would pick this for the Oscar , but I guess I might be alone on that one . But like I said , everyone has a different opinion , but I think if you just give this movie a shot , you'll find yourself laughing and having a great time . It's a great family film , I loved the animations , the story , and the songs , they were just terrific .
483685	1293485	109686	8.0	Jim Carrey at his best	I love Jim Carrey . He is honestly one of my favorite comedic actors . And I heard so much about this movie , that I just had to see it , and I laughed up a storm . Every joke in this movie gets a giggle at the minimum . I would recommend this if you enjoyed " Liar Liar " .
481984	1293485	105695	8.0	A classic feel of Western with the added brilliance of Clint Eastwood and an equally strong cast	I have heard quite a bit for " Unforgiven " , also I want to seen all the best pictures from the 90's . I was also excited to see Morgan Freeman in the cast , so I know now that " Million Dollar Baby " was not Clint and Morgan's first experience together . They work so well as a team and bring nothing but sheer entertainment and charm to movies . " Unforgiven " is a very good picture that has a real story and isn't just about " cops and robbers " or " cowboys and Indians " . How far would you go for a friend ? I loved Will and Ned's friendship so much because you could tell how much they had been through together and Will went back to his old ways in the blink of an eye for his dear friend . I loved watching Will's story through the movie , the first time you see him , he's just so charming and you would never had suspected of his former life of crime , alcohol , and bloodshed . Through the film , you have a lot of doubt for his character if he could go back to his old life despite his promises to his deceased wife . He , the Kid , and Ned go on a trip to kill two cowboys who cut up a prostitute's face for $1 , 000 . 00 . Together , they learn that this isn't going to be such an easy task when the boys they're hunting down belong to a town where guns and all arms are banned that could lead to a punishment as far as death . But Will gets sick and the Kid and Ned give a lot of talk in killing these cowboys themselves , when Will is just half himself he does the deed himself in killing one of the cowboys . He tells Ned to go back home and he'll take care of the other cowboy , he does so but gets caught and beat to death by the sheriff . The Kid and Clint do the rest of the job by killing the other cowboy and receive their reward by the prostitutes , but Will learns of Ned and goes back into his old habits . What happens next ? You'll have to watch yourself . Something that I learned that was interesting , Clint dedicated Unforgiven to Don Siegal and Sergio Leone , two directors who believed in him as a young actor . Unforgive is a remarkable film : methodical , deeply felt , with a devastating emotional and moral impact . It is easily one of the best Western movies . Like I said , it just has such a classic feel to it and you can't help but enjoy it . It seems like Clint might just own Hollywood one day . : )
483675	1293485	106856	8.0	We are D-fens !	You know , to those people who claim that this is racist or too violent , I think that they are just scarred . Because we all have thought like D-fens . The day that I saw this , I was visiting my friend , it was supposed to be just a one hour drive that turned into a three hour mess because of construction on the express way . I just wanted to get out of my car and walk to my friend's house , it would've been a lot quicker . Not to sound psycho , but also , I wanted to scream at the construction workers , they are destroying a perfectly fine street ! They charge more on the express way tolls now to put me in traffic for a longer time . The food mart , how many of us wanted to ask " Why do you charge so much for a bottle of pop ? " To street gangs , if we get off your " territory " , why do you still want to beat up innocent people ? The list goes on and on . Watch this movie and give it a chance . It's very true and we all can put ourselves in D-fen's shoes .
482467	1293485	451079	9.0	Very cute and so much fun ! Dr . Suess would be proud	I saw the first teaser trailer for Horton Hears a Who a few months ago , and I have to say that it was a little off putting , it looked kind of strange and like it might be another Cat in the Hat lousy movie , but then they started advertising it a little more and it looked more cute . So I decided to check the film out today and I am really impressed , so far I'd say this is the best animated film of 2008 that I've seen . I remember reading the book as a child , it's one of my old time favorite's , you could never go wrong with Dr . Suess . When it comes to his films being put up on the silver screen , excluding the 40 minute cartoon classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas , other films like The Grinch and The Cat in the Hat have been ultimate flops and horrible . But Horton Hears a Who proves otherwise and is a wonderful film to watch . Horton is an elephant just enjoying life , he's a teacher and is loved very much by the little animals of the jungle . But his life is about to change when he sees a little speck and saves it , inside this speck is a little town of Whoville . The mayor of Whoville has asked Horton to take them to a safe place before his town is destroyed . Seems like an easy enough task for Horton , until an angry mother , Kangaroo , feels like Horton and his speck are a bad influence amongst the children , and wishes to destroy the speck and trap Horton . Horton Hears a Who is such a wonderful film . For a book that you can finish in half an hour , they did a great job filling in other lines and such great jokes . The great thing is there is no pop culture or over the top jokes , they just go old school and make this film fun and original . The actors seemed like they just had a great time getting into character , Steve Carell and Jim Carrey are a brilliant combination , so their voices added a lot to the film . The animation was clever and colorful , it was a joy to watch . I very much recommend Horton Hears a Who , it's a terrific family film and just a fun movie to watch for the afternoon , I think Dr . Suess would be very proud too .
482242	1293485	39219	9.0	Brideless Groom	The Stooges are back and funnier than ever . " Brideless Groom " in my opinion was probably the best Shemp flick . Shemp has the opportunity to inherit $500 , 000 ( which was probably more than a million dollars compared to today ) from his dead uncle . BUT ! There is a catch . He has to marry someone that day by 6 o'clock . Shemp is a bachelor with not too many admirers , except for one high pitched aggressive annoying singing student of his . But he doesn't want her , he wants someone a little more on the Victoria's Secret model type of women . But obviously he has no choice since he's no Collin Ferrel himself . But when it is printed in the papers that he is to inherit all that money if married , his ex girlfriends are on the " I want my man back " attack ! What a great stooge flick ! This is up there with thewinners of all stooge flicks !
483395	1293485	74174	9.0	Who better to leave your children's care than in the hands of an alcoholic ?	LOL , I know I stole that line from I love the 70's , but I just thought it was so true and that was my exact thought from the first minute I started watching The Bad News Bears . Now to the movie , The Bad News Bears is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time , I almost died laughing throughout the whole movie . I obviously heard about this movie from the show I love the 70's on VH1 , way before the remake with Billy Bob Thorton . It always slipped my mind though when I wanted to rent it , but finally I remembered and I am so glad that I got the chance to see it , because this is one of the best comedies to come out of the 70's . Buttermaker is a has been baseball player and now an alcoholic , he is given the job of a little league coach for the Bears since no other fathers are taking the job . But he's definitely taken back when he finds out that the team he is coaching are kids who are , well , I guess you could say " lacking " in the department of knowing how to play baseball . But he just wants to get paid and get the job over with , but when their first game comes along , the kids get creamed 26-0 , Buttermaker is pressured to drop the team out of the league , but instead teaches the kids how to play and recruits a couple of new kids , a girl who's mother he used to date , and a rebel without a cause . The kids get better in each game , but it's a matter of Buttermaker getting his priorities straight when he lets the game get the worst of him . . . and he's an alcoholic ! The Bad News Bears is just so funny , Walter Matthau was just too perfect for this role as Buttermaker , he was so believable . I think my favorite Bear was Tanner , because the role could have been over done , but the kid did it just right , not to mention his last line of the film is just classic and fit the movie just right . I loved how the film wasn't your traditional your favorite team is always going to be out of no where champions , this was an awesome comedy that anyone would just fall in love with .
483558	1293485	104694	9.0	" There is no crying in baseball ! "	Oh , wow . This movie was amazing . It's funny , it's dramatic , and historic . I have known this movie since I was a little girl . And I am taking a film class in college and it said in the book that this movie is " overly femineme " I was insulted . I know what feminest is and this wasn't a big " Women rule ! " kind of movie . It was explaining the history of the All American Girl Baseball League in WW2 . I love this movie . There are a couple parts of Geena Davis ' character that drag down a little bit . But not too much . Go ahead and give this movie a shot .
482685	1293485	884328	9.0	I loved The Mist , the ending still has me screaming !	I saw the trailer for The Mist a while back , I thought it was just going to be a rip off of John Carpenter's The Fog , but after hearing some great reviews on IMDb , I got excited and my boyfriend and I decided to see it tonite . The beginning was starting off pretty slow , so I was thinking that this was going to be an average thriller , but about twenty minutes into the film , things really pick up . Things get scarier , more intense , The Mist had my digging my fingernails into my boyfriend's arm . I don't think we've had a better Sci-Fi film in a long time . I was thinking about how much this movie kind of reminded me of " Night of the Living Dead " , where everyone gets so scared and tense that they quickly turn on each other . It had a very similar ending , it just had me screaming . I can't give the ending away , but believe me , this is a movie not to be missed . In a small town , David , his son , and his wife have just been through a horrible storm . David and his son the next day decide to go to the grocery store , where everyone is a buzz of the horrifying storm . But something even worse happens , a man comes screaming across the street , begging them to close the doors , he has blood on his face , he's screaming how his friend was just killed by a mysterious mist . The mist has now surrounded the grocery store . After trying to figure out a way to save the food , a bag boy is killed by a vicious creature in the mist , the group now knows how serious this is . But things are getting worse with the local religious nut , Mrs . Carmody , she's turning this situation from horrifying to savage and turning everyone against another . But David along with a group full of people know that it's now or never . The Mist is one of the most horrific movies I have ever seen . It had me jumping every second and shaking , the great thing was that it wasn't a movie that had things or loud noise jump out at you , it was so natural , the whole setting and story just gets under your skin . A big round of applause towards the actress who played Mrs . Carmody , I couldn't believe how much I just wanted to jump into the screen and just kill her , but she was that convincing , she gets to you . Everyone did a fantastic job in this film , it's truly horrifying and will get to you . The scene where they find out about the marine knowing something about the monsters outside was one of the most intense scenes that I have seen this year in film . I promise you , this movie is going to be in the Sci-Fi classics for generations to come .
483493	1293485	424136	9.0	Who is the bigger villain ?	My friend just showed me Hard Candy , I was really looking forward to this movie because I saw that it was nominated for a few awards on the FUSE channel , or something like that for horror movies . She said this is one of those movies that will leave you puzzled at the end and I have to say that I was speechless after finishing it . It was so interesting because like the movie " Clockwork Orange " , the director in some sick way makes you feel sorry for a second for a deranged man who is a pedophile and a murderer . I never really did like those type of movies , but for some odd reason I liked this one . Haylie is a 13 year old girl who meets a charming 32 year old man off the internet , he claims to be a photographer and shoots young aspiring models who are in their teens . He takes her to his apartment , let's her make sexual flirts with him , let's her drink alcohol , and let's her start to do a strip tease , little does he know the joke is on him when he passes out and wakes up to being tied in a chair and has been drugged by Haylie . She won't let him go until he has learned his lesson . . . or will she ? The " operation " scene was one of the most disturbing scenes I have ever witnessed , it was so crazy and insane . But I really loved how intelligent Haylie was , I know that this sounds crazy but she did everything that every pedophile should go through , probably worse . Even though it seems like he should in some sick way get sympathy , you still want Haylie to get the message through to him . This was a great movie , I would highly recommend it , but I warn you it is not for the faint of heart .
483646	1293485	109836	9.0	We don't look at the creature as a monster , but another human being .	This was such a good movie . Kenneth is definatly one of my favorite actors in the world . He brings a lot of talent to the screen , and so does DeNiro . I thought that this movie was just beautiful and brillient . Like I said , the creature is really misunderstood in this movie . He was abandoned at his first sight into this world . And didn't understand how to survive in it . And you really hate Frankenstein for the thoughtless soul he was . And I was glad to see Frankenstein brought to justice at the end . Loosing the one's he loved most dew to his selfishness . The conversation between the creature and Frankenstein is the most intelligent I've heard since American Beauty . Just watch this movie . It is a movie that you'll learn to love .
483481	1293485	289765	9.0	Better than " Hannibal " , but not up with " Silence of the Lambs "	But it was pretty damn close . " Red Dragon " was a great movie to watch . I have to admit that I had my doubts . I heard some bad things about this movie from my friends . I had bought the movie for my mom , and she said just to give it a shot . I'm glad I did . " Red Dragon " goes back into the roots that " Silence of the Lambs " did . It had high action and drama . I was very impressed . And Anthony Hopkins does a great job as his most famous role as Hannibal Lector . I really have to say that I didn't stick to my friend's opinions . This was a great movie . I would recommend for the " Silence of the Lambs " fans .
481935	1293485	79073	9.0	Under rated	Come on , are you telling me that this wasn't a good Dracula film ? This brought excitement and romance back into the idea of Dracula . Frank made Dracula into his own and became the perfect cast for the dark prince . When I was younger , I wanted this guy to be my boyfriend ! LOL ! But he was just that effective . The story takes some different turns and isn't too close to Bram Stroker's novel , but still has high entertainment . Dracula still comes to buy Carfax Abbey in England by Jonathan Harker , which the actor scared me because he looks so much like my dad , but instead of keeping Jonathan as a prisoner , he is invited to a party with Jonathan and his fiancée Lucy's , that's right , Lucy , not Mina , family with her friend Mina who happens to have two little puncture marks on her throat . When Mina passes on , Dracula makes his move onto Lucy and falls in love with her . But of course Van Helsing has something else to say about that and will destroy the fiend that killed his daughter , that's right , you heard me ! Mina is Van Helsing's daughter in this one ! Well , anyways , I would recommend this Dracula movie . It's one of the better must see's for Dracula fans !
483490	1293485	117442	9.0	A very good story about the " mad monk "	I have to say that I was very impressed with the story of Rasputin . It was very accurate . Allen Rickman was amazing in the story . He is such an incredable and under rated actor . The whole story is great if you like to stick to accurate history . I wasn't too sure about the love story between the wife and Rasputin , they were mostly rumors . So , I didn't think it was necessary to add into the movie . " Rasputin " is a great movie to watch . I would highly recommend if you are into history . Especially Russian history or into the World Wars . Trust me , it will not disappoint you .
483724	1293485	195714	9.0	What if you could predict your death ? Would you prevent it or let it come ?	I finally decided to give the Final Destination movies a chance , I didn't want to see them when they were released because of the actors , just a bunch of Dawson Creek teen drama TV actors , and I figured the movie would probably suck or be a Scream rip off . But today I decided that maybe I should give these movies a chance , I heard from a couple people that they were pretty good . I apologize to the writers and director of Final Destination , because this was one of the better horror movies I have seen in a while . Basically , Alex and his fellow students , including four teachers , are going on a field trip to Paris , but Alex has a horrifying nightmare of the plane crashing horribly and exploding killing everyone . Right before they take off , he screams and tells people to get off , but only 6 follow him , one of which is in a fight with him , one of which believes him , one of which who was late for the flight , one of which was a teacher comforting him , one of which was his best friend , and one of which is the girlfriend of the guy who is in a fight with Alex . The plane explodes , killing everyone , thinking they're safe , Alex realizes that they were meant for death and it has a pattern , but it's a matter of playing Death ! Final Destination is original and a terrifying story that brings up the interesting subject of fate and destiny and if you make it or things should happen naturally . Not to mention the pretty cool death scenes that occur in this film is any horror fan's dream of watching . This is one of the better horror films of this generation and I'm looking forward to the next sequel .

One of my friends told me that I have to see the Rocky movies because they are very good and every movie fan should just see them . I'm also just interested in seeing what the hype was about . I actually was very surprised on how much I enjoyed the first Rocky . It had entertainment and was very inspirational . Rocky II dove a little more into what Rocky himself is all about . Obviously , from the first Rocky movie , he was just a punk off the streets who just got " lucky " according to Apollo , his competitor . In Rocky II , he and Apollo decide they want a rematch to see who is the real winner and fighter of the world since it was a draw match from the first Rocky . Also , Rocky marries Adrien and has a son with her . I did enjoy Rocky II , and I'm very much looking forward to the third one . I heard Mr . T is the star ! :
483268	1293485	48545	9.0	" You're tearing me apart ! " - best delivered line !	Two years ago in my film appreciation class , my teacher brought up Rebel Without a Cause and how influential it was and how it broke down walls to reveal the trouble in the a teenager's life . James Dean gives the performance of a life time and truly broke everyone's heart with his untimely death . I can see why he was so loved now . I felt deep down though that this was a wrongly titled film . Because Jim , despite rebelling against the system , wasn't really a bad kid . He actually was a great one , he just needed someone to listen to him . One of the most heart breaking scenes in that movie for me was after the tragic drag race , Jim tries to tell his parents what happened , you'll have to watch the movie to understand . But he wants to do the right thing and his parents are telling him one thing and another , but refuse to listen on what had happened to him . I felt his pain when you feel like everyone wants to make you better , but no one understands what's wrong and won't listen to you . This is a fantastic movie that I feel should be on the top 250 . It was one of the most influential movies that sparked a whole new generation and future as well on troubled youth . But a little warning , Rebel Without a Cause is by far the best teen rebellion movie .
482441	1293485	361596	9.0	An excellent documentary	Although , yes , it is biased in my opinion , I thought Michael Moore did a great job . I was impressed with his views and he stated the facts clearly . He did some great editing and showed the heart breaks of the families who have lost someone in the 9-11 attacks or the war on Terrorism . The film itself is great to watch . Especially if you are not for George W . Bush being president . Than this is the film for you . And me : D As a film , I have to say that it was good to watch . I'm not sure if all the facts are true . There is always another side to the story . That's the only thing that I found as a flaw in the film . Other than that , I would recommend this film .
483533	1293485	54443	9.0	Like the scariest unreleased episode of The Twilight Zone	I grew up watching The Simpsons , one of the episodes that is a classic favorite of mine has a little parody of Village of the Damned they called The Bloodening , lol . I always thought it was supposed to be a parody of Children of the Corn , but then I was watching 100 Scariest Movie Moments on Bravo and Village of the Damned came on and then the light bulb went on that this was the story the Simpsons made fun of . But I was so memorized by what scenes they were showing that I had to find this movie and watch it , I finally found it online last night and I absolutely loved this movie . This is one of the creepiest horror movies I have ever seen , so many people who always told me that creepy kids scare them , I never understood why until I saw this film last night , it gave me nightmares . Granted , I know that it's cheesy and you can easily MST3K your way through it , but watching this in the dark with those creepy glowing eyes is an image I will never get out of my head . In the small English village of Midwich everybody and everything falls into a deep , mysterious sleep for several hours in the middle of the day . Some months later every woman capable of child-bearing is pregnant and the children that are born out of these pregnancies seem to grow very fast and they all have the same blond hair and strange , penetrating eyes that make people do things they don't want to do . Village of the Damned is a very memorable film and just scared the living day lights out of me . I would highly recommend this for any one who truly appreciates film , because it is cheesy in some aspects , I think it takes a certain person to really understand this film and in the time it was made . The way these kids looked was just beyond disturbing , they looked alike , sounded alike , and acted alike . Those voices were so light , care free , it just got into your head that these kids had no boundaries and that's what's scary , you know that if a child has those powers , there would be no adults in this world . Village of the Damned is a terrific horror film , I highly recommend it , watch it in the dark , it's a lot of fun .
482724	1293485	305711	9.0	For an Ashton Kutcher film , I got a more than a few laughs	I know this film is getting a bad rep , but I enjoyed it . I really laughed a lot at the film . Yes , the script is a bit amateurish . And the story gets a little stupid here and there . But it seems to me that a lot of the people who hated this movie didn't put their guards down . I have the same problem to sometimes . I don't like Ashton or Britney . I think that they are amateur actors . They have a hard time acting . And that's why it came so natural in the film . That's how they really are . I'm glad I just decided to sit down and watch the movie . Let go and watch it . It has it's very funny moments . As for the 5 . 0 , I can let go . Some films , it just takes time I guess .
482249	1293485	237235	10.0	God ! So , that's what they went through to make this movie ?	It kills me to know what these actors had to put up with . And the excellent special effects . So , people , it wasn't strings that held the bed , it was a machine to those who think it's cheesy . It's disturbing , it's freighting , and just fantastic . The Exorcist , it's more then a scary movie , it's a master piece of history . And anyone who says it's funny or boring , look at again and not as the scariest movie of all time . Just think for a few minutes after the movie . Because you know for a fact that other horror movies have copied so badly off of this film . And it would not be named # 1 scariest movie of all time for nothing . And if you watch this making of the exorcist , you'll relize that you were very harsh on the film .
483075	1293485	1010048	10.0	What I'm feeling for this film isn't love , it's pure admiration	Slumdog Millionaire , the best film of 2008 by far , I saw this back in December after hearing a little bit about it on the net . I was so excited to see that it was playing at my local theater and I didn't hesitate to see it when it was released . There are a lot of people who are just asking why this film is so popular or loved , the reason why in my opinion is that it's just a happy film . We usually have a best picture winner that is depressing , but instead Slumdog Millionaire just lifts your spirits and makes you cry in joy . I couldn't believe how much I loved this film , after reading a summary on what it was about , I was just confused and wondering if this film was really going to be good . But we have these unknown young actors : Dev Peitel , Freida Pinto and Madhur Mittal who pull in heart wrenching performances and you can't help but love their characters and just keep rooting for them . All in all , this film is a love story . Most film lovers fear those words after Titanic because everyone thought it to be a predictable puppy love story , this love story however is made in strength and faith and you can't help but keep wanting Jamal and Latika to be together . Even though I saw the film a while back , I still remember it like I saw it yesterday . A title card is presented : " Jamal Malik is one question away from winning 20 million rupees . How did he do it ? A ) He cheated , B ) He's lucky , C ) He's a genius , D ) It is written . " Jamal is a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? hosted by Prem Kumar in which he was on the show and won 20 , 000 , 000 rupees ( about US$500 , 000 ) . Jamal then explains that , while at least the question about Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan was very simple , he knew the answers of most questions by chance , because of things that happened in his life . This is conveyed in a series of flashbacks documenting the details of his childhood . This includes scenes of him obtaining Bachchan's autograph , the death of his mother during the Hindu anti-Muslim violence , rekindling the memory of the 1993 anti-Muslim attacks in Mumbai by Hindu nationalists in the slums , and how he and his brother Salim befriend Latika . The children are eventually discovered by Maman while they live in the trash heaps . Maman is a gangster who " collects " street children so that he can ultimately train them to beg for money . Salim is groomed to become a part of Maman's operation and is asked to bring Jamal to Maman in order to be blinded . Salim protects his brother , and the three children try to escape ; but only Salim and Jamal are able to do so . Latika is re-captured by Maman's organization and raised as a culturally talented prostitute whose virginity will fetch a high price . The brothers eke out a living , traveling on top of trains , selling goods , pretending to be tour guides at the Taj Mahal , and picking pockets . Jamal eventually insists that they return to Mumbai since he wishes to locate Latika . When he finds her working as a dancer in a brothel , the brothers attempt to rescue her , but Maman intrudes , and in the resulting conflict Salim draws a gun and kills Maman . Salim then uses the fact that he killed Maman to obtain a job with Javed a rival crime lord . Salim claims Latika as his own and when Jamal protests , Salim threatens to kill him and Latika intervenes , accepting her fate with Salim . Years later , Jamal has a position at a call center . When he is asked to cover for a co-worker for a couple of minutes , he searches the database for Salim and Latika . He gets in touch with Salim , who has become a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed's organization . Jamal confronts a regretful Salim on tense terms . Salim invites Jamal to live with him and after following Salem , he sees Latika living there . He talks his way in as the new chef and tries to convince Latika to leave . She tries to discourage him , but on the first day that Jamal waits at the train station , Latika attempts to escape with him , but is recaptured by Salim and Javed's men . One of the men then slashes her cheek with a knife , scarring her as Salim drives off , leaving Jamal with the onlooking crowd . Jamal again loses contact with Latika when Javed moves to another house . In another attempt to find Latika , Jamal tries out for the popular game show because he knows that she will be watching . I cannot wait for this movie to be released on DVD , it's a terrific uplifting movie that just captures your heart and makes you feel good . I couldn't believe that people were just complaining about the ending dance sequence , it was a TERRIFIC way to end it , to see everything that Jamal went through and that dance just makes you feel happy because you can tell the joy of him having his Latika in his arms . It was a beautiful ending and makes you extremely joyful . The story is brutal , funny , sad , original and beautiful . Danny Boyle , I knew that this director had something special when he made the horror film 28 Days Later , but who knew he could pull of such an uplifting beautifully made film ? He picked the perfect actors , made the film wonderfully , and the whole crew seemed to enjoy making this together . Who wouldn't ? It was a pleasure to watch on the screen and if you haven't seen this film in the theater , buy it when it comes on DVD , it's one of the most terrific experiences I've had watching a film . We haven't had a film like Slumdog Millionaire and it's one of my new favorite films of all time .
482251	1293485	118276	10.0	A review from the # 1 Buffy fan	SPOILERS SPOILERS Now that the show is almost to it's end , unfortunally . Well , I figured that I should review over the seasons . 1-6 . This was a show that definatly effected my life and the way I look at it . I laughed , I cried , I almost wished that I could have a gang of friends like Buffy had . That were loyal , and fun . The show's first 3 seasons were the best . It was original . It was funny . It was awesome to see a girl kick ass better then a guy . We also see a very romantic relationship with Buffy and Angel . Something that kept us very interested and kept us watching every show . But in season 3 Angel and Cordelia left , kind of putting us down , but still wanting to watch the show . And going on to anoher show , Angel . But Buffy was still in the lead . As she went to college things changed a little bit . But we were willing to accept . And we lost Oz . Which was depressing for Willow . Spike became " neutered " . So he was not the bad ass anymore . Which lost a lot of interest in the character . Buffy got a new boyfriend , Riley Finn . Which was nice to see her happy again . She has been through a lot . She faced the Master , Spike / Drusilla / Angel together , the Mayor / an assention , Adam , Glory . But finally it came to an end . When buffy's new little sister came , she wasn't normal . Her sister , Dawn , was a key . That could open the gates to Hell . The enemy would cut Dawn and make her bleed over a certain spot and the only way to close Hell was to kill Dawn to stop the bleeding . Buffy claiming the monks that made Dawn made her out of Buffy , Buffy sacraficed herself and jumped and stoped Hell from opening . And she died . Leaving Dawn and the scooby-gang alone . In season 6 , on a new t . v . station , the gang brings Buffy back to life , and a lot of questions are brought up in this season . Spike still has a sexual obsession with Buffy . Giles has left . Willow is gaining more powers . And getting out of control with them . Xander and Anna are engaged . Dawn is depressed . And Buffy is very upset that her friends ripped her out of Heaven . Eventually Buffy and Spike start having a sexual relationship . Buffy keeps it a secret from her friends . Willow gets too out of control with her powers . Xander leaves Anna at the alter . And three geeks , that we used to know from former seasons , have decided to take over Sunnydale . And will eliminate Buffy to do it . And the way the season ends , two of the three nerds go to jail . But one of them is loose , and shoots Buffy . And shoots again and fires at Willow's lover , Tara . Willow gets angry and after trying to gain control of her powers , she looses control . And goes around looking for Warren , the nerd , and will kill him . She saves Buffy's life , and kills Warren . Willow decides to destroy the world . Xander stops her . Tells her that she is loved and that she can change . And that everything will be ok . And Buffy tells Dawn that from now on , she will help Dawn and show her the world that Buffy lives in . Buffy ended the relationship with Spike and told him she used him to make her feel better about herself . So , Spike is upset and wants to return to the badass he was and instead gets a soul in return . Over all , I have to say that the seasons started off strong . And hung on . The last seasons haven't been the greatest to watch . But the show is still my favorite . And keeps on the edge of our seats . I would recommend this show to anyone who loves every genre !
482612	1293485	92005	10.0	It's not a GUY'S film only	Without a doubt this movie is probably the best coming of age flick around , it has terrific acting and an incredibly touching plot that keeps you going throughout the whole film . I think the reason I love this film so much is because , everyone in some way could relate to it . When you're a pre-teen and have a close group of friends and face something so intense together , there's that special bond that no matter how much you loose touch with each other , one day , you just think of them and that one incident . Stand by Me is about 4 pre-teen boys whose summer is about to end and they are about to start junior high . They've obviously grown up together and are nervous of the world they are about to face , where they are no longer kids , but just about to become adults . When their friend , Vern , tells them about a kid their age that is missing that he found out by listening in on his brother where the kid's body is , the boys think it would be so cool to find the body and become the local town heroes . They have one problem though , there are these big tough guys who want to find the body first , it's a matter of who will reach it first . But of course , it's the bonding of the boys that really gets you into the film . These are some of the best characters I have seen on film , we start with Gordy . Gordy is an intelligent writer who lost his big brother , his idol , in a car crash recently and can't get any love or respect from his father and it's obvious that he gets it from his friends . That's what keeps him going . Chris is the leader of the gang and Gordy's best friend , he comes from a very bad family and is dubbed the bad seed everywhere , he's the kid who you knew in school and just knew he'd turn out bad , but there's a deeper side to him . The speech that River Phoenix turned out for Chris was so beautifully dilvered as a child who's been disappointed so many times by an adult . Teddy is another bad kid sort of speak , he has a bad home life where his father is crazy and nearly killed him a few times . He has a quick temper , but you can tell that his friends keep him down to Earth and help him through the worst times . Then there's Vern , the funny fat kid who is pretty much scarred of everything , and in some ways is the 4th wheel . Still , Vern you can tell is a great friend and the other's appreciate him despite how he can hold them back . The acting is just phenomenal . Now , the directing , Rob Reiner is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time , he took these young boys and pushed them to their limits , he was so smart about it as well . He said in an interview that he had to get pre-teen boys who were close to the personality of the character in the film , so it would come natural to the pre-teen actors , and you could tell that this film was his baby , he put so much thought and love into this film . That's what makes this film so special , nothing could ever compete with a coming of age film like Stand By Me .
482799	1293485	171804	10.0	A love story of confusion and acceptance	Hilary Swank won in 2000 the Best Actress Oscar for 1999's " Boys Don't Cry " . While I think she did an excellent job , I felt the Oscar still should have gone to Annette Benning for " American Beauty " . But Hilary is awesome as well , this is a close tie for the Oscar . " Boys Don't Cry " is an excellent movie . I was really moved and touched by the story . It made me cry , I'm a girl it's OK : D , because just being accepted for being different is so hard . I felt so awful for Hilary's character . Bradon and Lela had a beautiful love that was awkward obviously , but it was true . This being a true story scares me a bit . Because we still haven't changed to this day in not accepting other's being a homosexual or wanting a sex change . Maybe this movie can help us realize some mistakes . I think this is a great movie to watch , but it is very graphic and disturbing . It's not for all , but I would recommend it . Hilary , you are a terrific actress , keep it up !
483246	1293485	114369	10.0	Absolutley Brilliant	After every great review of " Se7en " , I knew I just had to see this movie . I was greatly impressed with this exciting thriller . The beginning was starting a little rocky for me , but everything came in just right . Almost perfect , I really loved this movie . Everything about it . The acting , the sets , the effects . Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are amazing in the film with the fine cameo of Kevin Spacey as John Doe . Even though I knew what would happen at the end due to everyone telling me . But I was still more than into this film . I'd recommend this highly .
483042	1293485	805564	10.0	I know that this was not the intention of the film , but Lars and the Real Girl is one of the saddest movies I've seen	When I was reading what was considered to be the best films of 2007 , Lars and the Real Girl came up quite a few times , I wasn't sure since I had never heard of it before . But I decided to rent it and see what it was about , I watched the film last night and this was not only the most charming film I've seen , but for me it was one of the saddest . I think it just touched me how much this town stuck together to help one friend and get him back from a " delusion " , just unfortunately , it was semi-unrealistic at times , and I think that's what made me very sad , not to mention how lonely a person can get , I think we forget that sometimes . But the script was just so wonderful and Lars was just this character who actually didn't really seem crazy , like this dummy fantasy was something that made him come out of his shell , this story was just so beautiful . Lars is a shy and quiet man who just keeps to himself all the time , everyone always begs him to join the crowd , but he always backs down . But when his co-worker shows him a website with a " create your own sex doll " , Lars gets one , but not exactly for the purpose of sex , more like it's his girlfriend . Not like he's ashamed , he thinks she's real , her name is Bianca , and he even asks his brother and sister in law to keep Bianca in their house . Instead of hospitalizing Lars , the town pulls together and helps Lars by treating Bianca like a real person . Lars starts to come out of his shell and then even notices a girl , Margo , but he realizes that maybe Bianca isn't everything he's wanted in life . Lars and the Real Girl is seriously one of the sweetest films ever . Everything about this film was just wonderful and it was such a pleasure to watch . To be honest I am surprised that Ryan Gosling didn't get an Oscar nomination for Lars , he is one of the most touching characters in film that I've seen in a while . His scene with Bianca , the last one where he kisses her , there are no words , but it was such a touching scene , I turned into such a girl ( I am a girl , but I don't get all sappy normally ) , I cried so hard , it was just a beautiful scene . I would highly recommend Lars and the Real Girl , it's a great movie , has terrific performances , and just an original and lovely script .
483562	1293485	95159	10.0	Another hilarious movie that I almost died laughing at	I don't know how many things I have heard about A Fish Called Wanda , it just seems to go on and on . I've heard references from the game " Scene it ? " , the book " 1001 movies you must see before you die " , and Bravo's " 100 funniest movies of all time " . This movie I have just not been able to get away from and lucky enough my mom had this movie on VHS , so I watched it a couple nights ago , and I nearly died laughing at this movie . All the characters , you can't really choose a favorite because of the fact that despite their bad behavior , you love them . I have to say my favorite scene was when Otto was trying to get information from Ken and he tied him up , and when he was sticking the french fries up his nose and eating Ken's live fish . Oh , my God ! I was just laughing too hard for words . Every line in this movie is beyond funny and the scenes are just great . Each skit works together and the cast had such a good time , you could tell .
483510	1293485	365748	10.0	Despite the story being used a million times , this is a very funny film	My cousin had called me from London a few months ago and told me about this film . She also asked if there were any trailers or release dates in the states , I didn't know . I never even heard of the film , but it sounded hysterical . I did see the theatrical trailer a week later , but I was saddened that there was no theater around that was playing this flick . Finally it came out for rent , and I grabbed it immediately . I'm glad I did . The things that got me about this movie , is that it reminds me so much of my friends . If there is a huge crisis , I'm so much like Ed , I'm just calm and with whatever goes and my best friend is so much like Shaun , it's scary how her and I could relate . These boys are so hung over from the night before and their reaction the first zombie in Shaun's backyard is priceless . " Oh , my god ! She's so drunk ! " and Ed getting a picture when she attacks Shaun because he thinks that she's just hitting on him ! LOL ! The references to past zombie movies were great " We're coming to get you , Barbara ! " . Priceless . I love this movie a lot ! This movie is so funny ! Even though Dawn of the Dead ( 2004 ! ! ! ! ! ) was a great movie , this movie brings up all the sarcasms of the original , along with any other zombie movie . I would highly recommend this movie for a good laugh . The ending is the best part and highly touching . . . don't ask . Good job , UK ! ! !
482751	1293485	376994	10.0	This was the coolest movie ever !	I used to watch the X-Men cartoons constantly when I was a kid , so over all I knew their stories pretty well , I was very enthused when I heard about X-Men the movie , so automatically , I saw it in theater , even though I liked the movie , I felt it had no justice to the stories and back rounds . The second one had a little more taste and even more fancy shamcy effects that seemed to overpower the movie . The third X-Men was so awesome and effective to the story . It was a really nice completion to the X-Men story , if this is the last movie , we're not sure . But basically , now the mutants have a " cure " , it comes from a young boy who can turn all the mutants back to humans . This is good for some mutants who want a normal life , but it makes you wonder if the humans are just trying to hide from what fate has brought to them . Gee , like we don't have that going on today with certain subjects . ; ) The story is so beautiful and wonderfully done . It still had a comic book feel along with great eye candy to boot . The cast looked like they had so much fun making this film and it had great lines . I would HIGHLY recommend X-Men : The Last Stand , it's a terrific movie that I guarantee you will not want to miss . This is my favorite out of the three , it stuck to the story and made a great conclusion to our hero's end .
481998	1293485	162661	10.0	Now let's not loose our heads . . . this was an awesome movie !	Tim Burton , as always you know my rant on the love I have for this director , when given a dark subject , he always does a great job with it . Everyone knows the story of the famous headless horseman of Sleepy Hollow , every Halloween , we are guaranteed to at least see the cartoon or hear the story . So one of the best known ghost stories of all time stars Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane , the famous scientist who is a non-believer until he finally faces the scary figure . Johnny was definitely a great choice as Ichabod , he brought the perfect amount of strangeness , intelligence and then you have to love that he adds Ichabod being a bit of a coward , which to be honest was very human . Then Tim just had to add the nightmarish feature of having Christopher Walken as the ghost of the headless horseman , that wasn't a pretty image . In 1799 , New York City police constable Ichabod Crane is dispatched by his superiors to the Hudson Highlands hamlet of Sleepy Hollow , to investigate a series of brutal slayings in which the victims have been found beheaded . A frequent user of new , though so far unproven investigative techniques such as finger-printing and autopsies , Crane arrives in Sleepy Hollow armed with his bag of scientific tools only to be informed by the town's elders that the murderer is not of flesh and blood , rather a headless supernatural warrior from beyond the grave who rides at night on a massive black steed . Crane does not believe them and begins his own investigation , until he comes face to " face " with the Headless Horseman . Boarding a room at the home of the town's richest family , the Van Tassels , Crane develops an attraction to their daughter , Katrina , even as he's plagued by nightmares of his mother's horrific torture when he was a child . Delving further into the mystery with the aid of the orphaned Young Masbeth , whose father was a victim of the Horseman , Crane discovers within the Western Woods both the Horseman's entry point between this world and the beyond , the gnarled Tree of the Dead , and his grave . He finds the Horseman's skull is missing though the murders continue until Crane uncovers a murky plot revolving around revenge and land rights with the Horseman controlled by Katrina's stepmother , Lady Van Tassel , who sends the killer after her . Sleepy Hollow is sure to be a classic down the line , I loved that it's rated R , because honestly I know this is supposed to be a child's ghost story , but if it was made that way with Tim Burton as director , it would have taken away the good scares that Sleepy Hollow provides . This is a pretty bloody movie and does have some really good scares , so I'm warning you ahead of time . But there are terrific actors , great sets and this will be a fun movie to watch every Halloween . Tim Burton gives us another dark classic that teaches us how to get " aHEAD " in life ! Lol , you never saw that coming , did you ? Yeah , just watch the movie , it's a lot of fun .
483489	1293485	102926	10.0	" The Godfather " of all thrillers	I've seen way too many thrillers . You name it : " Identity " , " Seven " , " The Usual Suspects " , etc . , etc . , etc . I remember my friend being so obsessed with " Silence of the Lambs " , that it drove me crazy . And I hated the movie naturally and refused to see it . But everyone told me that I have to see this , so I let my guard down . And had an open mind , and I'm glad I did . My friend was right , this is a great movie . It is so well acted , I couldn't even describe . I loved " Silence of the Lambs " and would recommend it to anyone . It's creepy and exciting . Trust me , you'll love it .
