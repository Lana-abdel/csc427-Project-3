585864	783721	303373	1.0	Socially irresponsible redundant crap	" Our America " tells of two black juvi's who are given recorders so they can do a radio documentary of their project / ghetto . An unfortunate but well intentioned flick , " OA " has nothing new to offer and appears to be a misguided attempt to expose the real truth behind the projects ( drugs , gangs , crime , cockroaches , etc . ) as if we haven't had our fill of ghetto flicks . What is worse , our heros play a game called " Knockout " which involves dropping rocks from a freeway overpass which everyone knows is as potentially lethal as the gangbangers shooting up the " hood " with their Uzzis and for which they receive a mere reprimand . Stupid tripe not worth the time . ( F )
587682	783721	100842	3.0	Awful	I can think of no construct of criteria by which one could measure " The Unbelievable Truth " and arrive at the conclusion that it is anything more than an utter waste of time . The believable truth about this flick is it is pure amateurish tripe . The unbelievable truth is that some people have found a basis for recommendation . (
587464	783721	249380	3.0	Boring	" Baise Moi " ( Kiss Me ) tells of two young women who go on a killing and fking spree . So , there's lots of killing and some graphic sex ( penetration , oral , etc . ) . Add to those two elements a pretty awful production with color shifts , graininess , lousy editing , poor effects , etc . ; unbelievable characterizations ; and other problems to numerous to mention here and you have your basic porn flick . Worst of all , there isn't enough sex for it to be good porn and too little story for it to be anything else . Conclusion ? Don't waste your time . ( D )
586742	783721	101897	3.0	Bottom gun .	" . . . Black Angel " pretty much just sucks . There are too many deficits to go into detail . The only reason to watch would be the flying and it's pretty ordinary . . . . snap rolls are about it . The story is lame and the execution worse with poor if any technical advice . Only for hard up sofa spuds who love aerial combat dog fights . ( D )
586772	783721	125778	3.0	Kind of like watching grass grow .	( Spoilers ) " Cash Crop " goes something like this . Down-on-their-luck farmers grow pot to make ends meet . DEA agent blows into town . Farmers hide the pot . DEA agent leaves town . End of story . This flick features solid performances by some second tier actors , mediocre direction , and a so-so screenplay . . . but it ain't got no story . And since the story is the foundation of every drama , " Cash Crop " is an utter failure . Too boring to recommend .

However , I don't like baseball and could only stomach about half this flick so I did the Tivo fast-forward thing and estimated the rest was as bad as the first .
586638	783721	139564	3.0	A waste of time	The title " See the Sea " suggests the same lack of creativity and substance which makes this film a huge waste of time . An austere , bleak so-called thriller , " See the Sea " is so devoid of anything and everything is simply isn't worth the time it takes to watch it . Bottom line ? Some freaky weird broad shows up at a woman's house and they sorta get to know each other and the freaky weird broad begins to act more freaky and weird . . . blaa , blaa . " See the Sea " is one for the dustbin . ( D )
587143	783721	277555	3.0	Not good enough for a Razzie	" Africa " is a drama which is sooooo bad it's funny . The film is about a blonde babe / model who is driving somewhere near Johannesburg , S . A . when her car overturns rendering her unconscious . When she comes to , she takes off in her miniskirt across the African wilderness instead of staying by the road ( duh ) and hitching home . After that , the film becomes and odyssey of survival where our cute little protag has to eat bugs and run from lions and all that exciting stuff . If you can swallow that premise , then maybe you have a chance of swallowing the whole horribly directed sham of a flick which follows . A real stinkeroo ! ! ( D )
586174	783721	266529	3.0	Don't waste your time .	" Falling Like This " is a jiggle-cam no-budget indie loser not worth the time . The flick has no story , no point , no purpose , no moral , no message , and comes off like a bad class project . What is supposed to be a slice of life flick about a couple of rebellious teens goes something like . . see the kids take a bath , see them drive a truck off a cliff , see them play darts and look at the sky and drink beer and get busted and hang out and pitch a fit and go to juvi and . . . yada , yada , yada . If you want to watch amateurish films , there are much better amateurish films than this on late night t . v .
586620	783721	256374	4.0	Gratuitous garbage	" Pretty When You Cry " is a klunker from beginning to end . Shot as a dark and brooding drama , this B-flick tells it's story of sex , drugs , and murder through a series of annoying flashbacks . Character development is nonexistent , the story weak and uninteresting , and the acting very ordinary . Cinematography is okay but can't save this very mediocre flick which is like a bowl of wax fruit : Looks good but you wouldn't want to eat it . A waste of time .
587438	783721	160289	4.0	Pass on this puppy	" Four Dogs Playing Poker " is an inept attempt to develop interest in a quintet of lame international art thieves who rip off a valuable statuette , proceed to lose it ( duh ) and then have to retrieve it or risk being whacked by their unhappy objects d'art customer . It is very obvious early on that this film just doesn't have much talent behind the lens as it is even more obvious in what it is trying to do and more obvious still in its failure to do it . One of those awful flicks where some capable actors in need of direction provide more drama by sinking helplessly into a mucked up mess of a movie than they do by delivering the film's story , " For Dogs . . . " is for the dogs . (
587085	783721	236474	4.0	Utterly boring	If good stories make good movies , you can forget " Margarita Happy Hour " . The flick follows a Brooklyn single mom , Zelda , through one pedestrian activity to another interminably . A sort of slice-of-a-dull-life flick , " MHH " is 95 % girl talk and 5 % plot none of which are likely to be , as movies go , of much interest to anyone . The flick does flesh out some characters well and offers good art and technicals . However , without a story , there's probably too little substance here for anyone save some single moms who can relate and fans of the players . (
586937	783721	249378	4.0	Cheap B-flick	Take a simple-minded story and leave out parts so as to mystify the audience and then plug them in later so we can relish in the revelation . Rent a handful of 2nd tier talent . Drag the shots out because you can't afford to be busy . . . busy costs money . Pump up the atmospherics because they're cheap . Avoid expensive action like blazing fire fights and blow up a cardboard cabin instead . And , voila ! You have " Backflash " , a cheap B-movie set in the BFAZ desert which tells of a video store owner , a babe , and a bunch of mob heavies all trying to get their mits on some ill-gotten dinero . This no brainer explains everything with flashbacks so it would make an ideal soporific for the weary couch potato . (
587174	783721	117399	4.0	A contrived , over-acted mess .	" A Promise to Carolyn " tells of the investigation of two middle aged women into the death of their little sister 30 + years earlier . A contrived mess fraught with herky-jerky flashbacking , over-acting , and poor technical consulting in hypnosis , law , forensics , etc . , this flick is an obvious fabrication with one purpose ; to jerk the audience around emotionally . Should be most appreciated by soaps junkies . At this writing the IMDB user rating of 7 . 8 computed from 37 votes is grossly distorted by 16 votes , almost half , giving this mediocre film a maximum score of 10 with no semblance of a Gaussian distribution .
586401	783721	120838	4.0	Dumb . . . but I laughed .	" Sour Grapes " tells of two guys , cousins , who are best friends until one loans / gives the other two quarters which go into a slot machine with a half million dollar payoff . They win and the feud over how to split the jackpot sets off a series of silly situational setups . " Sour Grapes " has little going for it . Even the comedy is somewhat hackneyed and dumb . Nonetheless , I laughed . . . but then I like dumb humor . Not recommendable but might be worth a peek for those who like silly , dumb sitcoms .
586684	783721	174336	4.0	Potential lost in a morass of vulgar nonsense	Four best friends young male chauvinist pigs ( with the emphasis on pigs ) meet weekly at a NYC diner to recount their dating sexploits in this misanthropic and visceral comedy . Peet is the common denominator who dates the three bachelors in the group which leads to conflict and the inevitable " whipping " . Although the film's premise has potential and there are some funny moments to be had , overall the flick doesn't work especially in the end where the girls are made to appear no better than the guys which runs contrary to the crux of the story . One of those one-man band flix with a dozen producers , " Whipped " is likely to be enjoyed only by the kind of young males who think " The Man Show " is Emmy material .
586827	783721	368913	5.0	Saw it all on CNN .	" Osama " tells of a fatherless pubescent Afghan girl who has her hair cut so she can impersonate a boy and help her mother get around by acting as the male escort required by the oppressive Taliban regime . Like so many third world films , " Osama " is a slow moving and laconic film with low end production value which , when compared with major films of today , doesn't measure up . On the other hand , " Osama " is a good first outing and helps illuminate yet another wretched dark corner of the world for those who may have missed the many documentaries about Afghanistan of the past few years . Will play best with foreign film buffs . Keep expectations real . (
587252	783721	118603	5.0	Far from perfekt	" American Perfekt " is a lukewarm psychodrama which spends its run time on a four travelers of questionable character bound by circumstance and highway in an arid Nevada desert . A slow starter , the film requires a whole lot of faith to get into and a broad attention span to stick with . However , for viewers who can suspend disbelief at the drop of a body part , " American Perfekt " may prove captivating . An okay no-brainer now on cable . ( C )
586234	783721	113149	5.0	A silly French sitcom with a whole lot of subtitles .	" French Twist " is a mildly humorous situational comedy about an attractive women , wife , and mother who is married to a womanizer who becomes outraged when his wife falls in with a dyke . From there , the story turns into a series of who-has-the-upper-sexual-hand situations . The film , with more flaws than favors , is dialogue-intensive and probably not worth all the subtitle reading for those who don't speak French .
587164	783721	233142	5.0	What a waste .	" 3000 Miles to Graceland " is a testosterone drenched junk flick with story which doesn't work , numbing excesses of mindless action , and a huge waste of star power and budget bucks . Deserving of the numerous Razzie nominations it garnered , this is one for the dumpster . Nuff said .
587627	783721	156515	5.0	Mediocre stuff for the less than mature audience	" Entropy " is a principle of thermodynamics which has to do with the ever increasing randomness of the universe . It's also a mediocre cult-type flick which Dorff self-narrates in real time and in flashback as it tells about the increasing chaos in his life . A no nonsense , fast moving , get-to-the-point tongue-in-cheek drama , Dorff plays a film director who falls in love , begins to get his career on track , and then , through a series of bad decisions , slowly loses it all . This off-beat flick leaves the audience with one all important question unanswered . Why do we care ?
587560	783721	95333	5.0	Bland , obvious , and lacking in chemistry and personality .	Not unlike a simple-minded Nancy Drew , McGillis plays a nosey but reluctant witness to Nazi war criminal underground railroad skullduggery who foils countless bad guys while falling in like with an FBI agent ( Daniels ) who doesn't carry a gun because they're too heavy . Yeah , right . Good old fashioned melodrama , " The House on Carroll Street " is a stagey , obvious , scripted , stiff , and sanitized for your protection . Recommended for viewers who prefer melodrama over reality .
586226	783721	289879	5.0	Unadulterared crap	" Unadulterated " as in not made for adults , " Butterfly Effect " offers some marginal performances in a silly make-it-up-as-you-go story which seems to be little more than an excuse to serve up huge helpings of gratuitous garbage for titillation of the those young people Hollywood just loves to rip off . You'll see a pedophilia , animal cruelty , sex , nudity , frat hazing , car trashing , prison fights , insane ravings , countless excuses to use the ever popular " F " word , and much , much more cinematic junk food designed to separate the old teen and young adult audience from the price of admission as this sensationalistic crap-filled flick wanders through the deranged mind of the central character ( Kutcher ) . Scorned by the critics but hailed by young males , " Butterfly Effect " is not worthy of a recommendation . ( C )
586183	783721	137036	5.0	Shoestring indie snoozer	Jerome , AZ is the destination of this road trip flick about a not too bright welder who walks off the job , leaves his family , and hits the road in his boss's car . A shoestring indie , " Jerome " is one of those shallow character-driven dramas where the camera lingers endlessly over every scene as though we're supposed to be wallowing in the pathos of the moment when we're really just getting bored out of our socks . Not totally unsatisfying , this flick delivers too little too late and in the end and seems to have no purpose other than showing us how much trouble a guy can get into by simply passively defaulting to the consequences of situations as they arise . For indie lovers only .
586715	783721	245356	5.0	Ode de parfum	" Perfume " is apparently supposed to be a behind the scenes look at the world of high fashion ; designers , models , photographers , gurus , wanabees , divas , dilettantes , etc . all involved in their daily esoteric industry activities in NYC . In spite of an even temperament and a sense of earnestness , this project just proves again that a good cast a good film does not make . A lackluster flick which wanders from one stagey scene to another showing us stammering characters with little depth while leaving us feeling disconnected , " Perfume " is marginally entertaining at best . With no story per se , no one to care about , and no clear insights into the fashion biz , there's little reason to recommend this fragrance . ( C )
587355	783721	126938	5.0	Plenty of Cherot	" Hav Plenty " is a little Afro-Am romantic comedy which tells of the wax and wane of an unspoken but simmering love between an unemployed writer , Lee Plenty ( Cherot ) , and a beautiful career woman , Havilland Savage ( Maxwell ) . . . hence the title , " Hav " and " Plenty " ( Get it ? ) . The film has a stagey feel from being shot on sets with characters occasionally speaking directly to the camera , avoids excesses ( excesses cost money ) , and relies mostly on a " less is more " philosophy to get from start to finish . Nonetheless , " Hav Plenty " has a sort of quietly endearing charm which must flow from Cherot as he is the auteur and lead actor and it - is - a true story . . . . or so he tells us in the film ( and I Tivo'd is from the " True Stories " channel on cable ) . Okay stuff for those looking for a low cal watch on tv . (
586930	783721	104892	5.0	" Mistress " misfires	" Mistress " , a misnomer , tells of a bunch of Hollywood hacks slogging through the process of networking , schmoozing , compromising , and sucking up required to launch a film project . A messy flick with little to offer considering the talent behind it , " Mistress " seems to be trying to make the point that making a film is often about everything but the film . . . careers , quid pro quos , personal agendas , etc . Unfortunately , " Mistress " is a poorly focused comedy / drama which doesn't work well in either genre . Most likely to be appreciated by people like the IMDB . com users who are not Hollywood insiders but have above average interest in films . ( C )
586365	783721	342577	5.0	Well , the camera was in focus .	" Iran , Veiled Appearances " isn't much of a documentary . However , it does transport the viewer behind the Islamic curtain and offers a sense of what contemporary Iranian life is like . It begins with a dab of history including brief file footage of the Shah and the Ayatollah Khomeini before launching into an exploration of the Iran of today much like an inquisitive tourist rather than an investigation of political , social , and cultural orders . Too much time is spent dawdling over visual spectacles such as parades , martial arts training , a dance class , paragliding , etc . , all of which are done in other countries ( a minute on each would have sufficed ) . The interviews with Iranians are man-in-the-street type with college kids espousing liberal ideals as do college kids everywhere while elders preach the usual conservative doctrine . The schism between the theocratic fundamentalist elders and the more western-thinking youth came as no surprise . However , if we are seeing the seeds of change or revolution , we weren't shown the forces keeping a lid on it . Overall , the film was only marginally interesting , lacked traveloguesque scenic beauty , offered minimal history , had no interviews with officials , and conjured nothing which could be considered investigative reporting . Pass on this one unless you really yearn for a peek at Iran . ( Note - I have a theory which suggests Peter Sellers did not die but grew a beard , moved to Iran , changed his name to Khatami , and became President .
586217	783721	144580	5.0	So-so	In " Rhapsody in Bloom " , a widower's ( Silver ) sister-in-law ( Miller ) tends to his children for years only to find the family ties interfering with establishing her own independent identity and life . A light hearted , easy going , romantic comedy which is a little ragged around the edges , " R in B " deals with matters of family , kids , an interloping fiancee , love in bloom , etc . with marginal credibility . A par cable watch for the couch potato in the mood for a no-brainer romcom with kids . ( C )
586003	783721	317248	5.0	Disappointing	" City of God " is an old story . So old , in fact , it begins in the 60's as it tells of gangsters in a Rio de Janeiro slum who do what gangsters do and have done everywhere for all the same reasons . Poverty breeds ignorance which breeds hopelessness which breeds desperation which breeds crime . . . etc . This film shows us nothing new , save the location and its paper thin characters , as it takes the audience into a slew of favela-dwelling punks with guns ( so many it's hard to keep track of who's who and who killed who for what reason ) as it attempts to impart a sense of warring in the Rio ghetto . You'll see such a convoluted mess of gang bangers there's no time for the film to provide character depth or a sense of the gangster ethos or the mechanics of the drug trade or a reason to care who lives or dies , etc . Just a whole lot of killing with numbing excess and only a hint of a human story . For reasons I am unable to deduce , " City of God " received raves from all corners and countless awards and noms . Go freakin ' figure ! Personally , I found the documentary piggy-backed into the DVD more interesting than the film and the one scene from the film I remember most ( it was shown twice ) was that of a chicken which was run over by a truck but escaped unscathed . If you like your street punk killing flicks with subtitles , go for it . (
585986	783721	198021	5.0	A mediocre feel good " chick flick " .	About as realistic as Disneyland , " Where the Heart is " is one long string of fabricated Kodak moments designed for maximum " feel good " effect . Although not challenged , the almost all female core cast is effective in dishing up enough appeal to obscure most of the sham and naivete of the story . Those into maudlin and schmaltz will enjoy this film while realists will likely reject it .
586474	783721	165929	5.0	Kung Fooey !	" Romeo Must Die " is a step backward in the succession of Jet Li flicks . Although it provides nominal entertainment and probably deserves a for technical and artistic production value , this film wanders from drama to comedy to action and back , spreading itself so thin as to have no real focus . The story is weak and its presentation muddled . As a result we're left with the impression Jet Li still hasn't found his market nich or defined his place among the great martial arts film stars . For Jet Li fans only .

" The Boondock Saints " tells of twin brother Irish-Catholics in Boston who turn vigilante and begin offing bad guys all over town while FBI agent Dafoe follows in their wake . A B-flick with good production value , a mediocre cast , a stupid story , and awful comedy , this flick has one man indie written all over it . A sort of simple-minded " Pulp Fiction " wanabee , " The Boondock Saints " is just a whole bunch of uninspired gratuitous violence which should play well in trailer parks all over the US . ( C )
586977	783721	235737	5.0	This is your nose on drugs ! Any questions ?	" The Salton Sea " is a confused genrehybrid schizophrenic dark comedy / drama which attempts to tell a compelling tale of a man ( Kilmer ) who lost his identity through cataclysmic personal crisis and sunk in a morass of drug culture crank freaks morphing into a narc snitch and an underground deep cover IA mole so deep his only identity is himself which he's lost but it trying to regain through revenge . Is that clear ? ? If not , you'll get some idea of how muddled this story is . Nonetheless , the film manages some moodiness and is busy enough that people into " pulp fiction " stylistics might want to give this a try . ( C )
587323	783721	120907	5.0	When is a game not a game ? When it's reality .	When is reality not reality ? When it's a game . " eXistenZ " is a terrestrial science fantasy flick which can be described as a 2-D Mobius strip with one side being reality and the other virtual reality . This dark and plodding film gets off to a slow start , grows interesting in the middle ( for those who are interested in this stuff ) , then collapses with a predictable conclusion . In general the film is an earnest effort though the story makes no meaningful human connection and the audience is taken on an abstract voyeuristic comic-book ride through what mature adults may regard as cinematic drivel and what teenagers and sci-fi junkies may regard as fascinating substance .
585987	783721	195714	5.0	An above average thriller / horror flick .	Although it falls well short of anything by Poe or Hitchcock , " Final Destination " is somewhat more intelligent than most films of this genre . Apparently targeting the usual teen market , this commercial thriller gets off to a good start , then lags a bit as it wallows in the usual blood and guts , and finishes somewhat better . Sawa does a good job of not over acting , supporting acting is on par , and the special effects seem almost believable . Most of all , the nemesis is never really defined which gives this film a somewhat unique mystique .

" Coast to Coast " sticks Dreyfuss and Davis front and center as a middle-aged couple on the verge of divorce who take a road trip from East to West coasts to attend their son's marriage while waxing nostalgic , visiting quirky friends , and sorting through old regrets along the way . Supposedly a poignant dramedy about reconciliation , this lame dose of couch potato fodder from Showtime has Toronto standing in for the US and a big hole where the entertainment should be . One can only speculate that budgetary constraints got between the cast and crew and a quality film product result . Coulda-shoulda been better , " Coast to Coast " is an uneven , uninspired nice-try-but-no-cigar near miss . ( C )
587596	783721	157183	5.0	A slice of Beirut life with no clear purpose or direction .	" West Beirut " is a plotless , non-story , non-documentary , meandering slice-of-life flick about a teenage boy's life in the early days of the Lebanese civil war when Beirut became divided into East and West . Although the film examines Beirut civilian life under the pall of war , it doesn't deal with any specific issue sufficiently to give it purpose . It's not particularly entertaining , evocative , or compelling ; does not chronicle events well ; is a poor study in history ; and is void of romance , mayhem , comedy , suspense , or any of the things which people go to movies to see . " West Beirut " has the " feel " of a make-it-up-as-you-go low budget journeyman drama . Recommended only for those with special interest in Lebanon .

On the inside of the of the besieged police station are a sergeant with issues ( Hawk ) and the high value prisoner ( Fishburne ) who team up to deal with the threat . On the outside is the equivalent of a SWAT team led by a ruthless killer ( Byrne ) . As this obviously contrived tale unfolds it becomes increasingly apparent it is just more of the same Hollywood B-movie material with nothing new to offer . There is , however , enough action to make for a lukewarm couch potato watch as long as the brain is disengaged and expectations are kept low . (

Good hearted street chick meets boy gambler and they hit the road for Vegas where she meets up with her long lost dad , falls in love with her traveling companion , and both learn some lessons in life . Unfortunately , this junk flick is a laughable miscarriage with the sundry heavies more fleshed out than the protagonists . Personally , I ended up liking the hitman who refused to kill anyone on Valentine's Day more than the hero and felt more compassion for the slutty stripper than the heroine . Don't waste you time with this mess of a movie which I'm sure Dunst and Caan are trying to forget .

Shot in the UK as a realistic drama , " Mona Lisa " runs longer than necessary considering the simplicity of its story . However , in doing so it becomes an in-depth character study with a hint of mystery focusing on the principals , showing their humanness , while avoiding exploiting its potential for sex , nudity , and sensationalism . Those who can appreciate the futility of the relationship of the star-crossed and mismatched duo , will enjoy this lukewarm film the most . However , all will have to contend with some thick cockney accents , poor quality sound , and mediocre cinematography .

However , the bro wants to acquire the hotel with a marriage of convenience so he can sell it to pay for transsexual surgery - something the distaff want to prevent each for their own selfish reasons . This Dutch flick gets busy and stays busy with nonstop prattling about the " this and that " ( zus and zo ) of the family , the bro , the hotel , and miscellaneous side plots making it a beautifully filmed and wonderfully cast dialogue-intensive subtitlefest for those who don't spekadalanguage . Mildly amusing , sometimes sentimental , occasionally poignant , always enjoyable , and incessantly yappy , " Zus & Zo " is just too much reading for too little payoff . (

Robson Green leads the way as an intense and determined workaholic cop with personal issues who will do anything to ferret out his quarry . Unfortunately mediocre , this series substitutes convolution for complexity and melodrama for psychodrama , drags out the suspenseful moments , doddles through the not-so-suspenseful moments , and never really digs into the minds or the guts of its protags . Obvious and contrived and lacking the edge of " Wire in the Blood " , the personality of " Cracker " , the realism of " Prime Suspect " , or the complexity of " Foyle's War " , this series is more sizzle than steak . Entertaining but not all it tries to be , " Touching Evil " smells a bit too much like a pretentious and simple minded Hollywood soap opera . (

William H . Macy , that " Fargo " guy , is at the center as a film critic who has an argument with a lady friend who slips , hits her head and dies . What follows is a slow , one step forward and two back unraveling of Macy's cover up scheme which leads to extortion , robbery , murder and lots of tongue-in-cheek humor while Macy narrates from both sides of the camera . A fun little " sleeper " on video .
585599	783721	166924	6.0	I only have one good thing to say about this flick . . .	. . . and that's " Naomi Watts " . Lynch , in an apparent effort to stretch , appears to becomes obsessive about this noir nonsense which by all accounts is a huge movie but which exit polls at theaters would probably reveal to be a loser . Bottom line , I about fell asleep from boredom as Lynch took his own sweet time pulling together the pieces of a jig-saw puzzle which develops into just so much excessive silliness . On the up side Watts turns in a stellar performance and Lynch limps along with no big names . On the down side is everything else : No characters we can identify or empathize with ; no hero or anyone we can care about ; a shoddy convoluted plot which just gets more ridiculous as time wears on ; etc . . yadayadayada . Bottom line , this movie sucked except for the titillating nude chicks making out part which only engages the limbic system . Hype = boxoffice and , as with " Memento " , most moviegoers will have trouble understanding what this flick was about and why they should care . Recommended only for film fanatics , critics , dilettantes , and the like .
585925	783721	113326	6.0	For Chan fans only	" Rumble in the Bronx " is one of Hong Kong martial arts celebrity Jackie Chan's earlier forays into the US market . And , since Chan has been getting better with age , his films have , with few exceptions , become progressively better with time . Therefore , the best way to watch Chan flicks is in reverse chronological order from the most recent to the earliest . Having said that , " Rumble . . . . " without the action wouldn't be worth anyone's time . However , " Rumble . . . " with the action is good enough for Chan fans but should be the last one to watch and will be of little interest to non-Chan fans . Excellent action but not Chan's best work . (
586861	783721	210756	6.0	Medium rare restaurant dramady	" In The Weeds " is a mediocre ensemble dramady repartee-fest about the staff of a restaurant and their activities during one night's dinner rush . The film offers a solid journeyman cast of familiar faces but relies too much on snappy patter and clever comebacks while trying to build a storyline that is marginal at best , groping for insight and sensitivity which never fully materializes . Nonetheless , there are several crisscrossing plot threads and enough energy and wit to make is a mildly entertaining broadcast watch . ( Note - Those interested in a very good drama which also takes place in a restaurant during one night's dinner rush should check out " Dinner Rush " with Danny Aiello .
587187	783721	252076	6.0	Entertaining and forgettable	In " Maid in Manhattan " , Lopez plays an ethnic NYC single mom and hotel maid who falls for an urbane politician ( Fiennes ) making this flick just another Cinderella knock-off . The film manages to push the right buttons in between awkward moments in spite of being uninspired flotsam in the grand scheme of cinema . Scoring poorly on this website and with critics , " M in M " is a worthwhile watch for flick chicks , romcom junkies , and J . Lo fans . (
587218	783721	179626	6.0	Overwrought nonsense	" 15 Minutes " tells of a couple of eastern European immigrants in NYC who go on a killing spree , video taping their murders so that they can get book and movie deals after being acquitted on an insanity plea . Yeah , right ! This flick is ridiculous , preposterous nonsense with a smattering of romance , a taste of sex , and a whole lot of hyperkenitic running around and fabricated suspenseful situations . Not for the jaded , " 15 Minutes " is a okay popcorn flick at best .
587127	783721	95801	6.0	Peculiar but charming little slow-starter .	" Bagdad Cafe " tells of a stout , laconic female German tourist who abandons her husband in the middle of California's Mohave desert and wanders into a ramshackle truck stop where she proceeds to quietly do a sort of Tony Robbins transformation of its eccentric inhabitants . A plodding slow-starter , this flick requires patience from the audience as it tells its somewhat sweet story and delivers its moral which is loosely something like " attitude is everything " . A worthwhile watch for those into quirky one-of-a-kind " feel good " flicks .
587271	783721	391024	6.0	A mediocre documentary with powerful subject matter	" Control Room " offers Arab views and perspectives of the war in Iraq with candid footage from the controversial Qatar-based Arab Al Jazeera TV network studios to the Central Command media center to the fighting in the streets of Baghdad . In spite of marginal production value , no narration , no show & tell diagrams or maps or charts or graphs , and a sort of hodgepodge structure , the people in the film makes some very good points which contrast with the western view of what the war was about . Well worth a look for anyone interested in the Arab view of Operation Iraqi Freedom but a pass for those who have had their fill of the misguided American foray into Iraq . (

You'll get to see a waitress wannbe poet argue with her mom about her future and the eatery owner anguishing over his decision to sell out . You'll get to see a street bum lecturing local blacks about their roots and a yuppie corporate type trying to close the deal . While the film tries to conjure the ethnic personality of " Barbershop " with the heart of " Big Night " it manages little more than a monotonous drone of uninspired dialogue which finally tapers off into nothingness with an unsatisfying conclusion . Nothing new here . (
586997	783721	35423	6.0	A pleasant little diversion for romantics	" Kate and Leopold " is a light hearted little romantic comedy about an English Duke ( Jackman ) from the late 19th century who travels through time and happens across the love of his life ( Ryan ) in the present day . Overall the film is a good production . However , the time travel thing makes it a bit unwieldy , squeezing the juicy stuff between a protracted setup and denouement while making the suspension of disbelief considerably more difficult than with conventional plots . Nonetheless , the film moves along quickly , spares us the usual dose of Kodak moments , and tightly knits its clever but cumbersome story . A fun watch for romantics and a possible disappointment for skeptics .
585996	783721	311730	6.0	Is it over yet ?	" Roman Spring . . . " is a theatrical teleplay which revolves around a recently widowed wealthy American actress in post-WWII Rome ( Mirren ) , a handsome Italian gigolo ( Martinez ) , and his pimp ( Bancroft ) . . . oh , yeah , and a bum ( homeless person ) . The film moves like molasses uphill as it delivers its meager story with heavy histrionics , minimal believability , and yammering ad tedium . Too long , too presumptuous , with an unsatisfying conclusion and poor psychodynamics , " Roman Spring . . . " is a lukewarm small screen watch which will have limited appeal . (
587403	783721	239986	6.0	Relationship soup	" Sidewalks of New York " is an emotionless quasidocudrama study of man / woman relationship set in Manhattan with the focus on three relationship ; one coming together , one falling apart , and one which is neither . Obviously tailored for the young adult audiences , the common undercurrent is sex though the film is rather tame and offers no nudity with chit-chat , repartee , and conversation being the order of the day . An okay product with a decent cast , " Sidewalks . . . " will appeal most to voyeurs and younger people who haven't been through the relationship mill many times over .
585872	783721	125022	6.0	So-so fun fluff stuff	" The Heartbreakers " tells of the misanthropic misadventures of a mom / daughter team ( Weaver / Hewitt ) of con artists who prey of the male libido and ego . The mom / daughter team offer eye candy and little else while the comic relief comes from " marks " Liotta and Hackman . A so-so romantic comedy with the emphasis on comedy , " Heartbreakers " is a moderately fun way to wile away 2 hours if not taken seriously and expectations are kept low .
586763	783721	366551	6.0	Gen-Y crass comedy	" Harold and Kumar Go to Whitecastle " tells of two ethnic buddies and wannabe yuppie potheads who take a road trip to the not-so-local Whitecastle burger joint becoming involved in all manner of nonsense along the way . The story isn't particularly important as the film is more a conglomeration of misadventures which beset the duo as they run afoul of a bunch of street punks , cops , a really weird tow truck driver and his hottie wife , and more . Chock full of gross-out and potty humor , T but no A , blatant vulgarity , silly situational comedy moments , and some unoriginal stuff borrowed from other films , this raucous road trip flick is not for the sophisticated and will play best with " boomer babies " and the college crowd .

587179	783721	120888	6.0	Subpar romcom	" The Wedding Singer " is ordinary romantic comedy fare which tells of a best buddy couple ( Sandler & Barrymmore ) who are each engaged to someone else when , of course , they are really in love with each other . Sound familiar ? This flick is an old story with a new paint job which borrows a summa-dis and summa-dat from a host of past romcoms while sporting little more than Sandler's unflappable style and a jumble of kookie characters . For romcom junkies and Sandler fans only . (
585747	783721	335185	6.0	A well told but thin story	" Jasper , Texas " recounts the events surrounding the horrible killing-by-dragging of a black man by three white men near the title town which shocked America in 1998 . This Showtime product exercises restraint in exploiting and sensationalizing the tragic crime while focusing on a small town trying to cope with finding itself at the center of national attention as media , FBI , Black Panthers , and the KKK converge on it . Voight and Gossett turn in solid performances as the town's Sheriff and Mayor respectively in this thin story with little extraordinary drama beyond the headlines . Somewhat weak as a stand-alone feature , " Jasper , Texas " will play best for those with a particular interest in the infamous Jasper story . (
587675	783721	346491	6.0	What a waste	Stone's " Alexander " tries to tell the story of one of the great military leaders and conquerors of all time who is to this day , some 2300 years later , is still studied in military war colleges . Unfortunately the film tries too hard to do too much resulting in three hours of jumping around in time trying desperately to show us the man and his human story while carrying on great expeditionary campaigns at the same time . With insufficient didactics , overzealous theatrics , and the esoterics of the time , the film becomes nothing less than a numbing mess . Listening to Stone's director's cut one gets the impression he had a clear vision of what he wanted to accomplish with his well researched historical epic . One also gets the impression he made the movie for himself . Lacking in coherence , muddled and messy , " Alexander " is a classic example of what happens when one ventures too deep into that creative territory where less is more resulting in a spectacular flop . (
586136	783721	135706	6.0	A noble , earnest HBO film memorialization of a bloody WWII battle	" When Trumpets Fade " is a noble albeit low budget HBO film which tells of one of WWII's bloodier and all but forgotten battles ; the battle for Hurtgen Forest . The film attempts to be a realistic representation of the carnage and horror of a battle where 24 , 000 American GI's died with some attention paid to the men who fought it , the focus of which is one enigmatic foot soldier played by Eldard . Although " WTF " may well be eclipsed by " Band of Brothers " , a much more elaborate and in-dept WWII movie / series , the film nonetheless should be of interest to those who remember the war or have an interest in WWII history .
586655	783721	160800	6.0	Pure corn but a good watch for family hour	" Running Home " is a predictable , melodramatic flick full of implausibilities with all the ear marks of a low budget soap . However , there's enough stuff going on from romance to murder to bad cops to fights to chases to the quest of the street kid and central character ( Ayre ) to meet the birth mother he's never known to make it an enjoyable watch for those who can overlook the host of contrivances it presents . Also , Ayre is just off-center enough to support the multitude of clichés around him . In short , an enjoyable watch for the whole family in spite of many short-comings .
586028	783721	314676	6.0	A bad idea nicely brought to fruition	A dark comedy with sardonic overtones , " The Singing Detective " tells of an man ( Downey ) with a bad skin condition and an equally bad attitude who writes a detective novel while hospitalized . The film jumps around between converging present day and 50's novel noir plots delivering two stories neither of which is sufficiently engaging to make for a worthwhile watch . The star power behind this teleplay-turned-screenplay can't overcome its inability to engross , involve , build empathy , deliver an occasional lol or get over its own off-putting misanthorpic sense of humor . Little more than a spectacle for the curious , the best thing about " The Singing Detective " is the 50's doo-wop music . (
586633	783721	97662	6.0	Journeyman Hollywood noir crime flick	" Kill Me Again " is a lukewarm noir drama which tells a very mediocre , convoluted , and unlikely story about a babe ( Whalley ) who rips off her boyfriend ( Madsen ) for stolen mob money and then hires a private eye ( Kilmer ) to fake her death . Madsen is the only well cast character in this watchable but ordinary flick .
587528	783721	295238	7.0	Not equal to the sum of its parts .	" Personal Velocity " squanders its run time on a narrated flick which is chopped into thirds with no synergism , each delivering a powerful though brief character study of a woman with issues . With some serious talent on both sides of the lens , this flick is more likely an auteur pleaser than an audience pleaser . Recommended for fans of Sedgwick , Posey , and Balk and indie lovers . Best saved for broadcast . ( B ) Note - According to the stats on this website , " Personal Velocity " is the antithesis of a " chick flick " scoring much lower with females than males .
586249	783721	210217	7.0	Visually beautiful , well crafted , but esoteric .	A drama first and biopic second , " Pandaemonium " tells of the midlife of renown classical wordsmith and critic Samuel Taylor Coleridge who's life was not terribly interesting though he was on the cutting edge of 19th century neoromantic poetry . Probably taking some liberties for dramatic purposes , the film involves the poet's relationships with William Wordsworth , his opium addiction , his troubled marriage , and , of course , his struggle with the demons of the creative process . Visually beautiful , well acted , but a tad theatrical with some annoying interjections , Pandaemonium " is probably too esoteric for the film-going public at large . A splendid effort which will likely be most appreciated by those into classical literature - particularly 19th century poetry . ( B )
586479	783721	316465	7.0	Heartwarmer	" Radio " is a fictional fact-based account of the relationship which develops between a South Carolina small town high school athletic director ( Harris ) and a mentally challenged black man ( Gooding ) . There's little going on in this sweetly sentimental film which juxtaposes campus life and football with family life and one man's life altering experience through a very rewarding though unlikely friendship . Oscar winner Gooding earned a Razzie nom for his portrayal while the critics pounded the film for it's sappy cornball approach to story telling and Gooding's exaggeration of his character . Nonetheless , the film earned respectable marks from the paying public who were touched by the heartwarming tale of a different kind of relationship . For sentimentalists only . ( B )
586848	783721	337960	7.0	Lotsa heart	" Danny Deckchair " tells of the adventures of a young concrete truck driver who decides to tie a bunch of helium filled balloons to his deck chair to soar aloft . His plan is to take shears with him to cut away one balloon at a time thereby making his descent . Instead , he leaves the shears behind and the balloons carry him to a new life and a new love . This sweet , cute , fun little flick from down-under is a fresh and creative new addition to the much over worked romcom genre . With lots of heart and unpredictable predictability , " Danny Deckchair " should be an enjoyable watch for those who don't mind a little schmaltz with their romantic comedy fare . ( B )
586453	783721	118682	7.0	Now that's what I call a Band on the Run .	Telling of a rock group of four imprisoned females who escape and enjoy overnight commercial musical success because of their notoriety , " Bandits " is not of the sexsational genre of B-flicks about women in prison commonplace in America . Instead it is a stylish , artfully shot sort of quasi - musical - drama - rock - video out of Germany with verve , solid music , a creative story , and a captivating screenplay . " Bandits " , which received high marks from critics and viewers , is just real enough to get involved with while being just unreal enough to make rooting for the escapees easily rationalized . Love the ending . Worth a look for those into " girl power " and rock music .
586629	783721	213847	7.0	A worthwhile film but a nebulous presentation .	" Malena " is about many things . . . . the people of a small Sicilian town during WWII ; a woman scorned by the town's women and admired by the town's men for her sensual beauty ; and a pubescent boy's obsession with the woman as he comes of age . Obviously the product of a talented auteur because of its technical and artistic excellence and its many poignant moments , " Malena " fails to focus clearly on its story such that the end result is somewhat less than the sum of its parts . The director of " Cinema Paradiso " , Giuseppe Tornatore , doesn't deliver a cogent product in " Malena " though the film has its moments . Recommended for more mature males .
586100	783721	268978	7.0	Hypekill .	There's little doubt that " A Beautiful Mind " is an excellent film . There's also little doubt that it was buoyed from buzz to Oscar acclaim by hype , strategic PR , and a gullible public . Taken in and of itself the film is rather ordinary among excellent films and not worthy of much of the critical acclaim it garnered . I personally found much of the film uninteresting , tedious , and downright boring . After all , how does one relate to someone whose accomplishments are so abstract as to be buried in esoteric symbolism and someone whose illness is so intangible as to be a state of mind ? The beauty of mathematics and the war with the demons of delusions were not brought sufficiently into focus by the film which spent too much time trying to develop a rather uninteresting character , making his delusions our delusions , spicing it up with a car chase and shootout , fleshing out the mental ghosts , and showing the principal's eccentricism with endless scribbling on window glass . Compensate for the hype , keep expectations low , and enjoy .
585878	783721	245712	7.0	Like being seduced with a hammer	" Amores Perros " is a subtitled Mexican film which tells three stories , each on a collision course with the other . Although the film is well cast and artistically and technically excellent , it is somewhat overwrought and inclined to wear on the audience at it's dramatic tales are pounded into us as opposed to making us yearn for more . One question every auteur should be prepared to answer when asked by an audience is " why should we care ? " " Amores . . . " works well on most levels but it's not likely Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is prepared to answer the question .
586122	783721	364800	7.0	More soap opera than history lesson	" The Last King " is a 3 hour , two part miniseries from the BBC which traces the life of King Charles II who ruled from 1649 until his death in 1685 . The upside of this film includes its sumptuous appointments and excellent cast . Well directed and crafted , the film is engaging , passionate , and delivers a strong sense of Charles II , his Monarchy , and the period . On the downside , however , the film is very difficult to follow given the absence of any prologue or didactics , the mixing of sir names and titles , and the presumption of some knowledge of the history of the time . The film squanders time on the sexual intrigues and personal relationships of the womanizing King while largely ignoring the more historical and profound matters of state . The Dutch Wars , for example , are barley mentioned while much time is spent on the machinations of one of his mistresses , Barbara Villiers making the film a bit more of a soap opera than a historical chronicle . Nonetheless , this elegant film is a must see for anyone interested in King Charles II and a should see for those into stories of the history of England's monarchy . No one does English period films better than the Brits and this one has production value equal to any similar films from Hollywood . ( Note - the DVD I watched has no CC's or Subtitles with much dialogue spoken in whispers or thick English , French , of Portuguese accents ) .
587408	783721	245540	7.0	A film about " America's Schindler " but no Schindler's List .	" Varian's War " tells of Varian Fry , an American citizen who sets about to liberate the great minds of Europe in the years prior to American involvement in WWII . An entertaining historical drama built for Showtime , this well made but somewhat scripted and theatrical film illuminates the mechanics of Fry's mission but is more stilted than engaging , more mechanical than compelling , and possibly bit off a piece of history bigger than what it could chew . Worth watching more for historical than dramatic value .
586259	783721	117615	7.0	Funny , wistfully sentimental , and utterly charming	" Shall We Dance ? " , a light-hearted flick from Japan , tells of an overworked accountant and family man who is attracted to a dance studio by a beautiful woman he see's from the train during his daily commute . What he finds in the studio are lessons in dancing and , most of all , himself . Funny , poignant , and utterly charming , " SWD " is an award winning film well worth a look by more mature viewers . ( B )
586318	783721	236285	7.0	Solid entertainment and a must see for jazz lovers .	A romanticized dramatic biography , " For Love or County " tells the true story of trumpet virtuoso Arturo Sandoval's escape from Cuba and oppression of artistic expression . A well composed and entertaining production , this film packs ideological and political conflict , a love story , and plenty of authentic Sandoval music into a two hour run . Perhaps most importantly , the film makes clear that freedom of musical expression is , to the musician , as important as freedom of speech ; especially when that music is jazz .
586154	783721	148573	7.0	Curl up with this like you would with a Christie or Sayers novel	" Painted Lady " is a 3 . 5 hour , two part miniseries made for Masterpiece Theater and featuring Helen Mirren as Maggie , a down and out and aging ex-druggie / blues singer who inhabits a cottage on the Ireland estate of a well-to-do friend . When her friend is murdered , Maggie makes an unlikely transformation as she turns herself into a countess , enters the world of classical painting treasures , and sets about to bring the killer to justice . A cozy mystery with a whiff of sex and drugs but nary a harsh word spoken , this typical Masterpiece Theater TV fare is a mildly entertaining watch which keeps moving as it becomes increasingly convoluted . On the downside , Mirren is much too sagacious and elegant for a down and out blues singer and the warm and fuzzy milieu fits the intended audience better than the story . On the upside , this Mirren tour de force and tale of intrigues in the world of art is captivating , engrossing , and sufficiently substantiative to keep the viewer involved for the long haul . Recommended for more mature viewers and those who enjoy the very civilized Masterpiece Theater fare . ( B )
585644	783721	311519	7.0	Like watching grass grow	" The Man Without a Past " is a doggedly plodding , austere , wan , and uneventful exercise in minimalism about a man who is beaten by thugs , gets amnesia , and then , with nothing but sheer determination , reconstructs his life anew . In spite of its critical acclaim and Oscar nom , this laconic subtitled Finnish film has none of the things we ordinary folk go to movies to see and in retrospect I can't think of a single reason to recommend it . There are no beautiful vistas or great sets or costuming , no intrigue or mystery or romance ( 1 . 5 kisses ) , no bigger than life charismatic stars , no action or effects , no moral or message , no sex or nudity , and , as near as I can tell , no reason or purpose for existing . Having said all that , I did enjoy this flick for whatever that's worth . (
586687	783721	114086	7.0	A stroll through an art gallery	" Beyond the Clouds " is an over-the-top artsy group of four vignettes each a offering a glimpse into a man-woman relationship from the tenuous to the turbulent . Although the film offers superb cinematography , some exquisite visual beauty , and a cast of fine performers , there's little meat on the bones of this fragmented work . A taste of a relationship cannot impart the fullness of it and synergism suggests that much more can be accomplished with one story in 2 hours than with four . Nonetheless , " Beyond the Clouds " will be fodder for dilettantes and a visual feast for the all albeit superficial , stilted , and lacking in substance .
586087	783721	106489	7.0	Yous got a problem wid dis ?	Set in an Italian neighborhood of the Bronx in the 60's , " A Bronx Tale " is a coming of age flick about a boy ( Capra / Brancato ) who becomes a protege of the urbane boss of the hood ( Palminteri ) after refusing to rat him out to the cops for a shooting . From there the boy gets some serious lessons in life in the hood under the wary and watchful eye of his hard working bus driver father ( Dinero ) . Dinero's directorial debut , this film is a by-the-numbers production with a slew of stereotypical mob type caricatures and histrionics which echo of Palminteri's stage play which offers some solid light dramatic entertainment . Not too be taken seriously , " A Bronx Tale " will be a worthwhile watch for those into wise guy flicks with some heart . ( B )
585919	783721	300471	7.0	Equal sequel	" Shanghai Knights " , sequel to and by most accounts equal to " Shanghai Noon " , sticks the same Chan and Wilson characters in another adventure which takes them to London where they become embroiled in convoluted intrigues neatly worked around everything from Big Ben to Charlie Chaplin to Jack the Ripper to Queen Victoria . . . etc . Fun stuff ( maybe funnier , depending on taste ) which features equal parts of Chan's inventive martial arts and stuntmanship and Wilson's poker faced off-the-wall comic relief , " Shanghai Knights " is an enjoyable three star comedy romp and I could go for another helping . What's next ? Shanghai Daze ? ( B )
586739	783721	244094	7.0	I laughed my a off . Thanks Eric , I'm now ale !	" Never Again " tells of a single middle aged man ( Tambor ) and woman ( Clayburgh ) who find each other , have good sex , and then begin to wrestle with issues as they search warily for deeper meaning . The film jerks from the outlandish to the sublime and back again making for an unpredictably bumpy ride while conjuring moments of hilarity and warmth . " Never Again " is another Schaeffer love it or hate it flick which is the work of a creative genius or sexually obsessed hack depending on who you talk to . Given its middle aged focus and explicit sexual content , " Never Again " will play best with more mature audiences who can handle vulgar language , absurd comic relief , and still appreciate the sentimental and poignant moments without rationalization . ( B )
586036	783721	315733	7.0	Excellent unpleasantness	" 21 Grams " tells a story of three people : A man who needs a heart , the widow of a donor , and the man who killed the donor . The film has critical plaudits aplenty , a couple of Oscar nom's for acting , a fine cast , and the work of budding " Ameros Perros " director Alejandro González Iñárritu . Unfortunately , the latter plus is also a minus as Iñárritu force feeds us two hours of pain and suffering with sledgehammer blows while chopping up the story a la " Momento " and never giving us anyone we can really care about . I double timed the last 30 minutes in X2 mode reading subtitles because I was disengaged , didn't like any of the characters , didn't care what happened , and was only interested out of idle curiosity . Good stuff if you don't mind a heavy handed approach to a morose drama of wall to wall unpleasantness with poor character development . ( B )
586215	783721	197569	7.0	Tedious and over zee top	" Humanite " appears to be a film about a child murder / rape and the search for the killer . In fact , the film is a character study en masse which tediously examines a handful of players with Schotte at the center as a rural cop . A critic's darling because it is oh so different , " Humanite " could be said to be avant guarde neo-hyper-realism . Or , it could be said to be a load of crap . The film does not equal the sum of its parts and is frustratingly incongruous for no apparent reason . I personally found it strangely fascinating . However , I suspect the film going public at large will reject " Humanite " as tedious and too over-the-top . Good stuff for cinema sophisticates into French film but certainly not for everyone . ( B )
587392	783721	265591	7.0	Somewhere between a 1 and a 10 .	" Pumpkin " slips mercurially through the genres ending up somewhere around black comedy with farcical overtones and biting undercurrents as it tells of a privileged , superficial sorority sister ( Ricci ) who " gets real " and falls for a mentally challenged man ( Harris ) while coaching him for a Special Olympics type event . The film boldly treads on thin ice , clumsily at times , as it tramples social constructs from decorum to morality while managing to maintain a marginally interesting storyline . Probably a real achievement given the experience of the auteur , " Pumpkin " will likely end up a love it or hate it flick of modest significance . Worth a look as a curiosity if nothing more . ( B )
586501	783721	308476	7.0	The highest common denominator	" The Cuckoo " is tells of the coming together of two wayward soldiers in the Arctic north of Finland at the farm of a lone Lapp woman during the end of WWII . The trio of players speak in different tongues making verbal communication impossible and though the men are sworn enemies they find common ground in a shared humanity which sees them through the difficulties of surviving wounds , coveting the same female , and learning lessons like the importance of being able to say " Don't Shoot ! ! " in your enemies ' language . " The Cuckoo " is an minimalistic light drama with low end production value which distills life to the bare essentials of humanity with its bold austerity . Recommended for foreign film buffs only . ( B )
587272	783721	377092	7.0	The square root of " Clueless "	" Mean Girls " is another bop fodder comedy about a high school junior who , having been outschooled all her life , goes to public school and tries to become one of the in crowd , a trio of shallow hotties called the " Plastics " , only to find she's become a back stabbing beyotch like them and subsequently realizing the error of her ways . . . yada-yada-yada . Always lively and light hearted , this slampoonfest of the teen female's peer pressure cooker problems is a fun romp full of the usual high school peer group stereotypes all slogging their way through campus social life . Fresh and funny if a tad silly ( ok , a lot silly ) , " Mean Girls " will play best with teen females . ( B )
587234	783721	94828	7.0	Worthy but not for general consumption .	" Camille Claudel " is an earnest biopic which tells of her rise to prominence in Paris as a student ( and mistress ) of renown sculptor Auguste Rodin , their love / hate relationship , her struggle for independent recognition as an artist , and her eventual descent into madness . A subtitled French film , " Camille Claudel " deserves high marks on all counts with sterling performances by all and all the trappings of late 19th century life in Paris . If the film has a flaw , it is the almost 2 . 5 hours is spends on the historically obscure , esoteric , and decidedly unpleasant subject which is likely to wear on , if not wear out , the casual filmgoer interested in entertainment . Not for the many , " Camille Claudel " will play best for patrons or students of French art , art history , sculpting , etc . ; for those with an interest in Rodin and / or Claudel ; and , of course , fans of the principals . ( B )
586487	783721	323944	7.0	Naked pictures of women ? ?	" Shattered Glass " tells the true story of Stephen Glass , a young upstart hotshot investigative journalist who wrote fiction or partial fiction and represented it as fact in the esteemed New Republic magazine and other publications . The film is a smartly pitched hardcore no frills drama which recounts events leading up to the explosive 1998 scandal created when the magazine went public by exposing itself as the unwitting purveyor of countless fraudulent articles . Most of the film is set in the offices of TNR magazine and the film is devoid of the usual Hollywood tinsel . . . . no action , violence , sex , thrills , exotic locations , megastars , etc . However , for those into tales of ethics , journalism , and / or aberrant personalities , " Shattered Glass " may well be a spellbinder . Good stuff with plenty of critical plaudits for drama enthusiasts and those interested in investigative journalism . ( B )
587197	783721	325145	8.0	Brains vs brawn	" Box 507 " ( not a PO Box but a safe deposit box ) is all about a husband and father , Pardo ( Resines ) , who loses his daughter in a brush fire and seven years later serendipitously discovers the fire was not the result of an accident but rather subterfuge . Pardo sets about to seek justice and finds himself embroiled in a web of intrigues involving Mafiosos and other criminal elements . This well crafted drama gets busy and stays busy with a coolly cerebral approach which avoids extremes of emotion , sex / nudity , romance , and other visceral appetizers though there is blood letting aplenty . A worthwhile watch for anyone into Euroflix with , of course , subtitles . (
587050	783721	151691	8.0	An excellent no frills , no nonsense human drama .	With dogme-esque style , " My Name is Joe " takes the audience to Scotland and into a pivotal slice of life of one alcoholic Scot . . . a man named Joe who , nearing midlife , finds himself still struggling for some semblance of success and happiness . Earnest , honest , and realistic apply to both film and character in this look at the seamier side of Scottish life . An excellent watch for those who enjoy realistic Euro-flicks .
585795	783721	257360	8.0	Great if you get it .	" About Schmidt " sticks Nicholson at the center as a recently retired nondescript midwest WASP widower who , finding himself with too much time with which to reflect on the emptiness of his life and the vacuum left by the absence of spouse and career , takes a road trip . A wonderful blend of off-kilter stereotypes , keen satire , plaintive reflection , and bittersweet humor , " About Schmidt " will drive like a dagger through the hearts of many while soaring over the heads of others . How you react to the film will tell you more about yourself than about " . . . Schmidt " . An excellent wry meditation on the meaningful meaninglessness of one man's life which will resonate most with more mature audiences . (
587181	783721	265307	8.0	Time well spent	" The Man From Elysian Fields " tells of a struggling writer ( Garcia ) who pens his soul into the pages of a novel in a last ditch bid for success . A solid three star romanticized drama with a beautiful cast , " . . . Elysian Fields " delivers its " deal with the devil " story with seductive style and an engrossing ebb and flow which will entrance those who can overlook the subtle contrivances required to make the puzzle pieces fit . Good stuff for all but the most cynical drama junkies . (
587415	783721	249462	8.0	Brit flick goes Hollywood and wins kudos .	The much lauded and nominated film " Billy Elliott " is a slice of life flick about an 11 year old English boy who , to the dismay of his motherless working class coal mining family , chooses ballet over boxing as a pastime . The film is technically excellent , artistically well done , and follows the traditions of Hollywood film-making . The story is a pleasant mix of humor and pathos , not too deep , and palatable enough to make it an audience favorite . In addition to being just plain fun to watch , " BE " makes a few points about accepting people for who they are ; about the undeniability of innate passion by artists ; and about the sublimation of aggression through dance . Not a classic and somewhat over rated , the simple numbers prove " BE " is a box office favorite and an enjoyable watch for most . Kudos to the choreographer and Bell for some fun to watch and never seen before kookie , kid-like mixes of jazz , tap , ballet , and jigs .
585782	783721	114117	8.0	Forget the book . Enjoy the movie .	" Persuasion " , another Jane Austen novel knock-off , is a romantic dramady about a twenty something spinster , Anne ( Root ) , in Victorian England whose quiet demeanor leaves her and her secret affections eclipsed by the busy prattling and affectations of her polite society family . At issue is whether the unrequited love of the quiet , true , and intelligent protag will succumb to the rigors of societal manipulation and die in obscurity or win out over all the false pomp and circumstance . The film offers excellent production value , is skewed toward reality and away from melodrama , and provides a sumptuous feast for anyone with a taste for English period flicks . I personally have " Persuasion " right after " Sense and Sensibility " and " Mansfield Park " in my list of favorite Austen adaptations . (
587650	783721	300879	8.0	The usual high quality BBC Victorian novel knock-off	" The Way We Live Now " , like most Victorian period satire , looks into the lives of numerous characters sorting through the intrigues and foibles of romance , wickedness , power , and the pursuit of peerage and property . A lightly perfumed costume flick which tilts unabashedly between comedy and drama , this story centers on a crude but rich businessman ( Suchet ) whose powerful performance is the backbone of the film . Side plots include an issue fraught romance , an attempt to marry into a fortune , a scheme to build a railroad from Utah to Mexico , cheating at love and cards , politics , a woman scorned , and much more . A four hour TV miniseries from the BBC , " The Way We Live Now " has plenty of time to sort through its many characters while tidying up at the end making it a busy and enjoyable Victorian period film . A should-see for anyone into BBC TV fare , Victorian period stories , and 19th century pulp fiction . (
586108	783721	246719	8.0	A sleeper for the discerning drama enthusiast	" Julie Walking Home " is about a woman coping with a rocky relationship with the father of her children , her son who has cancer and may or may not be healed by a faith healer , and her feelings for a man who believes he has mystical healing powers . Though the film's storyline is nothing new , the sheer reality of the drama , the wonderful performances Holland wrests from some relatively unknown actors , and Otto's tour-de-force makes this film eminently worthy . Not unlike " Behind the Red Door " ( 2002 ) , " Hysterical Blindness " ( 2002 ) , or " Unfaithful " ( 2002 ) this film is a " sleeper " which will be of greatest interest to the discerning drama enthusiast into film's about women in turmoil . (
586278	783721	246772	8.0	Mostly Martha but all good .	" Mostly Martha " is a thoroughly delightful tale of a comely , self contained , socially unassured , and occasionally gauche German master chef , Martha ( Gedeck ) , in need of a recipe for living who finds love through tragedy and romance through cooking . In thinking about these comments I concluded that there is nothing I would change about this film except the language ( I don't speak German ) . A perfect little gem , " Mostly Martha " is the kind of flick which makes you feel sorry for those who won't watch foreign films because of subtitles and wonder why audiences dine voraciously on cinematic junk food when such palate pleasers as this are not only delicious but nutritious .
