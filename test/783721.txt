585864	783721	303373	1.0	Socially irresponsible redundant crap	" Our America " tells of two black juvi's who are given recorders so they can do a radio documentary of their project / ghetto . An unfortunate but well intentioned flick , " OA " has nothing new to offer and appears to be a misguided attempt to expose the real truth behind the projects ( drugs , gangs , crime , cockroaches , etc . ) as if we haven't had our fill of ghetto flicks . What is worse , our heros play a game called " Knockout " which involves dropping rocks from a freeway overpass which everyone knows is as potentially lethal as the gangbangers shooting up the " hood " with their Uzzis and for which they receive a mere reprimand . Stupid tripe not worth the time . ( F )

A abysmal failure at droll Irish comedy with Spacey as a thief who enjoys outsmarting the cops and his competition becoming a sort of folk hero in his own mind , this flick manages to be mildly amusing when it's trying to be funny , slightly more than boring when it's trying to be interesting , and forget sentimental or poignant or endearing though it takes shots at those qualities as well . " Ordinary Decent Criminal " has a clumsy screenplay , naive direction , journeyman execution , thin story , poor casting , mediocre acting , and eventually becomes lost in itself and sinks into a mire of hopeless mediocrity . Pass on this one . ( D )

There's no story here - just a disjointed collection of events . Ferrara seems to get off on the juxtaposition of the holidays and home life with narcotics peddling in NYC , jumping back and forth between each . The players appear to be improv'ing and adlibing now and then making for an unconvincing watch . Overall a poor effort not worth the time . ( D )

Add to those two elements a pretty awful production with color shifts , graininess , lousy editing , poor effects , etc . ; unbelievable characterizations ; and other problems to numerous to mention here and you have your basic porn flick . Worst of all , there isn't enough sex for it to be good porn and too little story for it to be anything else . Conclusion ? Don't waste your time . ( D )

Telling of a couple of loser / druggie-type punks and their encounters while on a road trip , this flick is a par production which loses everything on story .

Pass on this junk flick . ( D )

There are two reasons to watch this flick . . . Kinski is one and Piven the other although it's difficult for their sparks to shine in such a complete directorial disaster . Everything is wrong with " Red Letters " . . . convoluted , lousy screenplay , camera , editing , and most of all acting which is subpar for Coyote , etc . Battersby has taken a story with potential and turned it into a seriously flawed and amateurish flick not worth the time .

You only have to scan the roster to see the personnel are a bunch of B-listers and maybe seeing ex-Playmate Eleniak get naked is the most one can hope for . Unfortunately , this lame flick doesn't even deliver a little gratuitous T & A as it limps along though its trite and cliche-ridden story about a beautiful hitwoman , a bunch of money , and a broke mom and son destined for a showdown . Pretty awful stuff not worth the time . (

He also corresponds via snail mail with a young girl in a Polish orphanage . When she is sold into slavery , Seagal has to travel to Poland where , of course , he gets to hang out with a babe , shoot it out with a bunch of heavies , and do some hokey martial arts stuff as well as try to act and conceal his big , fat gut . A sorry attempt at film making , " Out of Reach " has too many deficits to list here . Suffice it to say this B-flick is probably not worth your time and will probably be the last Seagal flick I'll be watching . (

The film is long on talent but so short on story one can only wonder how it ever got into production much less distribution . Slow , monotonous , boring , and dumb , " Desert Blue " is one of those B-flicks which one watches with detachment always cognizant of the fact the characters are actors going through the motions required for their paycheck . For fans only . ( C )
586648	783721	175877	5.0	An action / comedy no-brainer for audiences with no brains .	" Made Men " is the kind of flick where the shoot-outs expend more ammunition than the shooters could carry . It's the kind of flick where an auto gas tank explodes like a case of dynamite , not 10 gallons of gasoline . It's the kind of flick where a Brit plays a red-neck sheriff with both accents prevalent in his speech . It's the kind of flick where a guy pulls a gun which hasn't been fired and there's smoke coming from the muzzle . It's the kind of flick you'll want to miss unless you're 14 and male .
585845	783721	118760	5.0	More dismal , dreary stuff about Ireland	" The Boxer " tells of a man ( Day-Lewis ) who returns to Belfast following a 14 year prison sentence for IRA misdeeds and sets about opening a community boxing gym while renewing an acquaintance with the woman he loved before being sent to prison . The film offers solid performances in a doggedly plodding and somewhat unsatisfying story which lacks cohesion and seems to come off like just more woebegone sniveling over the age old Irish rift . A good watch for those with the stomach for yet another flick about people caught up in Irish issues .
586679	783721	118668	5.0	Would you like a little testosterone with your popcorn ?	" Back in Business " tells of a ex-cop who teams up with his ex-partner to make a drug bust and . . . well , fix everything else which is wrong with his little corner of the world . A marginal action flick at best , " BinB " has very ordinary stunts and action sequences replete with all the usual machine gun wielding heavies ; a sexless love relationship between the hero and delicious Dara ; and lots of fun macho banter between Bosworth and his partner . If the film has anything at all going for it , it's the sort of dumb charm of square jawed and ruggedly handsome Bosworth's character who is trying to get in touch with his feminine side and control his anger with the help of his talk-radio psychotherapist while clumsily stumbling into the action spotlight and settling old scores . An okay no brainer for action junkies only .

A kind of lyrical telling of a gritty story , this bland film tries to squeeze too much into the run time leaving a feeling of shallowness and superficiality , lacks the passion and suspense of the subject , and plays out much like a soap opera . Nonetheless , there's beauty to be found and enough emoting going on to give " Charlotte Gray " some appeal . Most likely to be enjoyed by females old enough to know something about WWII .

This slice-of-rock-life look at the aging rock musician almost works but can't seem to avoid those oh so very Hollywoodish excursions into lesbian sex , sex for drugs , rape , revenge , etc . More music and fewer gratuities and this could have been a reasonable representation of the plight of the aging rocker , the narcotic-like hold music has over the musician , and the trade-offs and sacrifices they make for their art . However , when all is said and done , " Prey . . . " plays out like just another B-flick wannabe . Recommended for rockers and Gershon fans . (

There is as little to praise and there is to fault in this easy-going B romcom now on cable . An okay time killer for couch potatoes . ( Note - Farley Granger , 50's heart-throb , makes a rare appearance in this film .

Spader takes up with a babe who happens to be a nurse and the ex-wife of the town Sheriff , etc . , etc . Toss in a lame FBI rookie , some Indians , and a bunch of flashbacks about Spader's past , mix them with a low budget and poor direction , and you have a film which will make you cringe when you're supposed to be enthralled or yawn when you're supposed to be thrilled . The only thing this loser has going for it is an unexpected twist at about the halfway point which doesn't make it a good film but it may keep you from ejecting your DVD prematurely . Best saved for broadcast . (

" Angel's Dance " features Belushi as the hitman's guru who tests a young protege with an assignment to " hit " a beautiful but freaky woman , Angel ( Lee ) , selected at random . Both get more than they bargained for in this darkish comedy with some action and lots of quirky humor . The film is fresh in the beginning , languishes in the middle , and pulls itself together in the end making for a lukewarm watch overall with some deliciously sardonic tongue-in-cheek humor . An okay small screen watch for channel surfers looking for comedy / action .

" Jack the Dog " is also naive , simple minded , and shows us nothing we haven't seen many times before . Oh , and BTW , the cute little novelties ( euphemism for brain farts ) , such as flashing Estella's name on the screen when Jack can't remember it , only serve to remind us we're watching a movie . This flick deserves and E for effort , a P for promise , and a B for boring .

This lame little coming-of-age flick is packed with lessons in life such as don't bury your guns in sand traps or it's okay not to swim with half naked babes or don't believe old drunk guys . Although this film's heart is in the right place , I'm not sure its director was . A jumbled , messy indie which never quite coagulates , " A Gentleman's Game " has so much golf stuff in it that it would probably be more enjoyable for those who know something about the game . Personally , I thought the film was much like the game ; slow moving and boring . ( C )
586518	783721	109219	5.0	Kind of like watching grass grow .	Save pure voyeurism , it's difficult to see the entertainment value in a film which simply portrays the pedestrian , sublunary vicissitudes of ordinary people who are probably less interesting than ourselves . " Barcelona " , a journeyman light comedy / drama indie , features postcard shots of the title city , a bevy of babes , and two pretty ordinary guys who just banter incessantly about the most uninteresting stuff . Flawed and with plotholes aplenty , " Barcelona " is a film in need of a story and fails to distinguish itself in any significant way . Passable , forgettable stuff though the auteur may be a work in progress with potential .
587006	783721	210616	5.0	A weak film lacking the passion of it's subject .	" Center Stage " , a film about young students of the ballet trying to succeed , is diluted by too many characters ( most of them sophomoric stereotypes ) and soapy subplots and plagued by bad acting , melodrama , juvenile music , and even mediocre choreography . The film lacks the verve and passion of the art it attempts to represent though it does showcase plenty of dancing . This flick will be appreciated most by young females and dance enthusiasts .

A light hearted , easy going , romantic comedy which is a little ragged around the edges , " R in B " deals with matters of family , kids , an interloping fiancee , love in bloom , etc . with marginal credibility .

Betwixt and between such trite nonsense is the real story , the real nonsense , which takes itself so seriously as to be almost laughable . Don't waste your time with this loser .

One thing leads to another and mayhem ensues . Not much of a film , " 2LDK " is a mediocre little thriller with good camera art , decent work by the players , some pretty hokey moments , and a paper thin plot . Running at about 70 minutes , this short film is all Japanese with hard-to-read subtitles and , no matter how you cut it , its no more than two women , one apartment , and one evening . Recommended for people like me who've seen just about everything in their favorite genres or anyone who thinks two women , one apartment , one evening sounds good . (

The pair are on a collision course in this flick with a bunch of heavies , some T-men , and a beautiful prostitute ( Davidovich ) who knows both men biblically . The film tries unsuccessfully to build human elements into the characters . Hopper is a sentimentalist with panache who likes ballroom dancing while Snipes longs for his divorced wife and son . Unfortunately , " Boiling Point " hasn't the intensity the title would suggest and just slogs it way through a more-of-the-same cops vs bad guys plot with poor quality drama and almost no sensationalistic action . . . no chases , crashes , stunts , pyro , sex , nudity , etc . A lukewarm tv watch at best . (

A B-flick at best , this little indie is rough around the edges showing signs of low budgetness and a lack of attention to detail with plot parts which don't dovetail well . However , when all is said and done , the film's good naturedness , poignant crescendo , and feel good conclusion make it a worthwhile watch for the couch potato in the mood for some casual small screen entertainment .

Not unlike " The Doors " ( 1991 ) , " Wonderland " sticks Kilmer out front as a character of dubious notoriety - in this case 70's porn star John Holmes - and then proceeds to make up what it doesn't know while sensationalizing what it does know resulting in a typical over-hyped , over-wrought Hollywoodized no-brainer rip off . Those expecting a dose of sex and nudity can forget it while those expecting a docudrama can forget the " docu " .

An award winning film with nominally satisfactory reviews , this little budget-conscious effort is fraught with low end production value , scenes which simply don't work ( like the incredibly unprofessional casting call with a Hong Kong company rep ) , bad jokes ( like the peanut thing , the phone number thing , etc . ) , mediocre music , zero atmospherics ( meeting your boyfriend at a construction site ? ? ) , a poor ending , and a general absence of auterusmanship . Nonetheless , " Double Happiness " limps along with some poignant moments , a giggle here , some angst there , and maybe even a sentimental pang now and then . An okay cable watch for anyone with time to spare who's in the mood for a Chinese-Canadian generation gap flick . Note - I have always thought Oh was much more skilled than she was marketable . It's nice to see her in a leading role and though she doesn't nail all of her nuances in this flick , the responsibility for that probably belongs with the director . (

586954	783721	161081	5.0	If you like this flick , get out your Ouija board .	" What Lies Beneath " offers a thin story , a weak plot , two of Hollywood's most over-rated stars , and little else . Things go bump in Pfeiffer's head as the camera lingers ad nauseum in one fabricated suspenseful moment after another and the perfectly perfect couple's encounter with the paranormal unfolds . The film is predictable and fails to compel the audience to make the necessary leap of faith required by all such spooky flicks . A big disappointment from Zamackis and a waste of time for all but the most avid supernatural junkies .

This doggedly plodding movie manages to stretch 10 minutes of story into a full length feature with narration heaped upon narration leading to an unsatisfying and hollow film with a voyeuristic feel and limited audience appeal . Couch potato alert : if you begin to get bored while watching this flick , surf away . It ain't gonna get no better .

" Where the Money Is " is a lukewarm light comedy / drama with very little going for it beyond three excellent core actors and a cute premise . Newman , a malingering and savvy thief / convict , is upstaged by Fiorentino's refreshingly unique mix of larceny and loyalty in this so-so production which dwells too much on logistics and details and not enough on relationships .

In spite of being a good natured light drama with a heart , " Diamond Men " can't escape its amateurish screen play and obvious low budgetness as it wanders through fields of pure corn all the way to its feel good conclusion . A mildly enjoyable B-flick which should be an okay sofa spud watch if it makes it to broadcast . ( C )
586022	783721	235048	5.0	The last Civil War movie to see	" Wicked Spring " is a very ordinary low budget indie which plays out like a slice of Civil War life as men from both sides spend time together during a respite in the Battle of the Wilderness . This plotless film is put together with relatively unknown actors delivering mediocre performances ; lots of reenactment battle scenes which give no sense of generaling and strategy ; and a big dose of visuals to make up for the absence of content and story arc ; etc . I'm a Civil War buff of sorts and have seen just about everything from Ken Burns CW to Glory to the Gettysburgs to the Civil War Journal , Red Badge of Courage , North vs South , etc . , etc . and , though I think I understand what Hershberger was trying to do with this movie , it just didn't work for me .

586762	783721	241025	6.0	Thackery goes Hollywood	" Vanity Fair " ( 2004 ) is an acceptable but abbreviated version of the classic Thackery Victorian period novel which tells of Becky Sharp ( Witherspoon ) , who uses artifice and charm to climb from lowly governess to aristocrat , always able to find a suitable family of peerage or property to use as a rung in her ladder to the top in spite of the tribulations of the time . At just over two hours , this film cannot deal in depth with the many characters in the story and has to content itself with hitting the high points which make for a very condensed telling suited to those who only wish the flavor of the story . Those with a particular interest in Victorian pulp fiction or more expansive dramas should turn to the BBC's 1998 six hour miniseries which offers greater character depth , a presentation much more true to the period , and a very much better cast .

587569	783721	91188	6.0	Good but vague in purpose .	" Heartburn " has Mick Nichols at the helm with Streep and Nicholson starring and an excellent supporting cast including a bit debut by Kevin Spacy . In spite of all that , the film has only managed lukewarm commentary from critics and public alike . Taking a somewhat cynical look at marriage as it follows one couple ( Streep & Nicholson ) from nuptials through the birth of two children including infidelity , this well crafted flick muddles comedy with drama to a nebulous end . An enjoyable watch for mature people who've been there , " Heartburn " will likely disappoint others because of its uneventfulness and lack of purpose .
587048	783721	210358	6.0	The preeminent chick flick .	Though more cerebral than most chick flicks , " Things . . . " is all about women and women's issues . A plaintive and sometimes quirky look into a handful of female lives , this film is shot as several vignettes connected by one or two cross-over characters . Lacking in substance and story , " Things . . . " relies heavily on a cadre of fine actors , a script which is a tad surreal , and the voyeuristic inclinations of the audience . A good watch for female couch potatoes .

As with most docudramas , this film leapfrogs through time hitting the historical high-points while trying to maintain continuity and build a dramatic tale . The result is a better history lesson than dramatic biography and a film which will play best for those with a specific interest in the Sicilian Mafia of the late 20 century . (

In " The Name of the Rose " , Connery plays a 14th century Franciscan monk who , with his novice ( Slater ) in tow and armed with a wealth of scholarly knowledge and acute powers of observation and deduction , visits a dank European abbey to solve mysterious deaths . Little more than an enjoyable European cum Hollywood popcorn flick , " . . . . Rose " is entertaining though obvious and contrived . Now on the cable circuit , " . . . . Rose " is free and contains some comic book characters such as Pearlman's hunchback , a sexy little scene where Slater kisses some skanky local babe hello and his celibacy goodbye , and a visit from the ever-popular and always wicked Holy Inquisition folks . Fun and spooky stuff for the couch potato .

Biopic drama " Veronica Guerin " represents the title character , an investigative journalist who is out of expose the drug bosses of Dublin , as a woman who has been beaten up and threatened with her life if she continues her work and who , in spite of all that , continues while taking no counter-measures ( no Kevlar® , no body guard , nada , zip ) . How smart is that ? In the end we are told her martyrdom resulted in all but ridding Ireland of drugs and everyone can remember what they were doing when she died neither of which ring true . Additionally , the film quite ordinary in spite of actor's actor Blanchett's best efforts . Pretty much the usual drug stuff only this time set in Ireland where we're used to seeing film's about people killing each other over politics and religion . This time it's drugs . Very ordinary stuff for Blanchett fans or those with a particular interest in Guerin . ( C )
587619	783721	100928	6.0	Typically Eastwood all the way .	A knock-off of a fictionalized recounting of eccentric film director John Huston's safari experience in Africa during the filming of African Queen , Eastwood creates and plays a peculiar quixotic and egocentric Houston-like character . As with most Eastwood films , " White Hunter , Black Heart " follows the formula for Hollywood product success making it an entertaining but very lukewarm watch .
586859	783721	126762	6.0	A melodramatic Victorian soap opera	" The Tide of Life " is a 3x45 minute TV period miniseries ( circa late 1800's ) based on the novel by prolific authoress Catherine Cookson . The film follows the life and loves of the winsome , dutiful , hard-working , and ever honest button-cute housekeeper Emily ( Gillian Kearney ) as she strives to carve a life for herself from the farms and villages of rural coastal NE England . As watch Emily overcome one hardship after another in her quest for happiness , her dauntless and earnest approach to life always serving her well , this melodramatic tale passes quickly through time skimming over details and leaving many characters under-developed as though the entire novel was crammed into 3 hours giving it a rushed feel with no lingering in the moment . " The Tide of Life " is not the best of the Victorian TV dramas coming out of the UK and pales before the likes of " The Forsyte Saga " or " The Mayor of Casterbridge " . Nonetheless , it should be an enjoyable watch for distaff viewers into Victorian drama . ( B )
586110	783721	338565	6.0	The worst English language subtitling I've seen	The first half of " Love Me , Love My Money " is mildly amusing romcom fare . The second half I didn't see having abandoned the DVD because what I was seeing was not worth the effort required to read the subtitles . I've watched many subtitled films and this flick probably has the worst I've seen . The font is small , the translation poor and verbose , and the subtitles aren't stacked to allow for longer on-screen durations but delivered one line at a time requiring a lot speed reading with eyes fixed at the bottom of the screen . The result is a lot of pausing to be able to catch the humor buried in the dialogue ( no sight gags ) , watch the facial expression , etc . Remember , if you watch this dialogue-intensive film with someone else ( Non-Chinese speakers ) you'll only be able to watch as fast as the slowest reader .
585984	783721	140397	6.0	Quirky , tentative , unpredictable , lighthearted fun .	" Mumford " is an unpretentious little romantic comedy with a softspoken , creative way of whetting curiosity and maintaining interest as it wends it's way through it's quirky but charming storyline . Sans the usual commercial " chick flick " schmaltz and boasting an R-rating , " Mumford " appears to refuse to compromise its freshness . A pleasant way to wile away 110 minutes .
585925	783721	113326	6.0	For Chan fans only	" Rumble in the Bronx " is one of Hong Kong martial arts celebrity Jackie Chan's earlier forays into the US market . And , since Chan has been getting better with age , his films have , with few exceptions , become progressively better with time . Therefore , the best way to watch Chan flicks is in reverse chronological order from the most recent to the earliest . Having said that , " Rumble . . . . " without the action wouldn't be worth anyone's time . However , " Rumble . . . " with the action is good enough for Chan fans but should be the last one to watch and will be of little interest to non-Chan fans . Excellent action but not Chan's best work . (
587424	783721	364725	6.0	Still more Stiller	" Dodgeball " is another Stiller formula comedy which packs wacky characters and silly stereotypes into a story about a glitzy state-of-the-art health club owner ( Stiller ) who wants to add a failing garage gym , owned and operated by Vaughn , to his empire . Unwilling to give up his small time but nerd-friendly operation , Vaughn challenges Stiller to settle the dispute over a champion dodgeball tournament in Vegas . Factor in a babe and the usual good vs evil elements with the underdog issue and a screenplay which is hyperkinetic and kaleidoscopic and the result is an enjoyable comedy romp worth a look by anyone who enjoyed similar Stiller fare such as " Zoolander " or " Duplex " or " Starsky & Hutch " or " Envy " , etc . ( B )
586237	783721	171580	6.0	A film only a soap junkie could love .	" Nurse Betty " , the Zellweger title character , is a passive , ordinary Kansas housewife who believes herself to be romantically involved with a soap opera character after being traumatized by witnessing the brutal murder of her husband . This much over-rated flick will disappoint many as the violence and language demands an R rating while the comedy is so sophomoric as to have little appeal for mature audiences . Zellweger's performance is good but not deserving of an Oscar nomination as it requires no stretch and only stands out because there's so little going on around her . Good fodder for soap junkies and Zellweger fans .
585998	783721	360009	6.0	Objects in this movie may seems closer than they are . . . .	. . . depending on barometric pressure . In " Spartan " , Kilmer plays a badass who is a kind of " Swiss Army knife " of paramilitary agent types who has to help the Secret Service track down the kidnapped daughter of a high ranking USA government official . The film has some twisty-turny stuff in the story backbone and a whole lot of running around including a few small arms firefights , some 1-on-1 mutual combat , and some spy gadget stuff . No sex , romance , or relationships as the characters are too busy and too poorly developed . We the audience , have to reconcile ourselves to just going with it , rooting for Kilmer because he's obviously the hero , and savor whatever testosterone rush we can get from the film's machismo drenched screenplay . Everyone in the film talks in that clipped , contractionless , emphatic Mamet signature speaking style which is so obviously concocted it's sometimes humorous . Nonetheless , this guy flick is kind of like pizza and beer . . . not gourmet cooking but very enjoyable if you're in the mood . (
587218	783721	179626	6.0	Overwrought nonsense	" 15 Minutes " tells of a couple of eastern European immigrants in NYC who go on a killing spree , video taping their murders so that they can get book and movie deals after being acquitted on an insanity plea . Yeah , right ! This flick is ridiculous , preposterous nonsense with a smattering of romance , a taste of sex , and a whole lot of hyperkenitic running around and fabricated suspenseful situations . Not for the jaded , " 15 Minutes " is a okay popcorn flick at best .
587377	783721	356150	6.0	A flick only a teenager could love	" Eurotrip " tells of the misadventures of a High School grad who learns his German e-mail pen pal is a babe and not a dude and travels to Europe with 3 friends ( 2 guys + 1 girl ) to hook up with her . The result is a no brainer comedy romp chock full of all the stuff an 18 year old would like to see / do in Europe . . . . drinking with a soccer team in England ; nude beaches in France ; absinthe and beer in Germany ; brothels and hash brownies in Amsterdam ; some crass antics in the Vatican ; and lots of sex and T & A everywhere . A flick only a teenager could love , " Eurotrip " is unabashedly silly and unsophisticated fun without the raunch of the " American Pie's " . Slammed by the critics ( expected ) with above average marks from the public , this mindless comedy is a moderately pleasant time killer for those into unadulterated silliness . (
586866	783721	317198	6.0	Just another sequel	" Bridget Jone : The Edge of Reason " has Zelleweger reprising her role as the socially inept , unflappable , and pudgy British journalist in the company of her co-stars ( Firth , Grant ) while breaking no new ground but rather pushing the story forward with a grunt and a groan and an obvious lack of fresh creativity . We get to see all the same befuddled smirks and grins of embarrassment as Zellweger dutifully goes through the motions of playing the undaunted , unwitting , always affable clown who is caught from scene to scene in contrived sitcom moments while earnestly attempting to manage the affections and advances of her two leading men . Unfortunately , we're not reminded of why we should care about Bridgette nor why her male leads care about her as she has no redeeming qualities beyond her ability to ignore her own ineptitude for forge ahead in pursuit of happiness . The film , which slipped a notch from the original in the eyes of public and critics alike , is well shot and staged and is not for want except in the writing department as the screenplay , in the tradition of sequels , is just more of the same . Those who loved the original B . J . film will like this knock-off . Those who just liked the original may find this sequel disappointing . (
587162	783721	117739	6.0	Earnest , sincere reality film out of the UK	" Stella Does Tricks " tells of a Scottish teen female's struggle to escape a life of prostitution . Sans the glitzy appointments of the usual tinsel town fare and exploitive sex and nudity usually accompanying the subject matter , this austere film focuses on the real problems of the principle ; addictiveness of easy money , low self esteem from childhood abuse , etc . With excellent performances all around , especially by Mcdonald ( Stella ) , this film's only flaw is annoying dreamlike flashbacking which is too often ambiguous in an attempt to be poetic . Good stuff for those into sincere , earnest , hardworking reality pix about the socially disenfranchised .
586065	783721	232083	6.0	Would you like some roofies with your chocolate ?	Let's get real people . " Nightcap " just ain't that great . After reading some of the critical comments on this film , I decided there was as much projecting going on by reviewers as by the people who cast the film's imagery on the silver screen . Chabrol or no Chabrol , " Nightcap " is awkward , mechanical , scripted , incredible , unbelievable , monotonous , and has an unsatisfying conclusion . Yes , it has an up-side too including Huppert , Huppert , more Huppert and some intriguingly ominous undercurrents , etc . However , there's just too much wrong with execution and too little payoff in the end to make this film a worthwhile subtitle read for most non-French audiences . In short , this is like some really bad early Hitchcock . Recommended only for critics , French film devotees , film fest groupies , Chabrol fans , and the like . (
587024	783721	120867	6.0	A dark little comedy . Very little .	A tedious , dialogue-intensive story about the vicissitudes of a mentor / protege hitman team , " Jerry & Tom " is a study in understatement with a pointless plot and an ending which may make you want to " whack " yourself for having watched the whole thing .
587292	783721	191754	6.0	A low cal , mildly entertaining version of an old story .	" 28 days " is a superficial and not-too-serious mix of comedy , snappy dialogue , superficial dramatic excursions , a minimal cast , and the only persona in Bullock's repertoire with the serious drug abuse / rehab subject . Some will find this drama-lite film entertaining in spite of its numerous short comings . Others will feel is doesn't do justice to the issues .
586600	783721	261755	6.0	An excellent film with limited appeal .	In " Jackpot " , the Polish brothers tell the story of a character who is more curious than interesting - a soap-selling professional karaoke hustler ( Gries ) with his own agent ( Morris ) and impossible dreams of making it as a pop singer . The film has a good premise and an excellent execution but is doubtless destined to be one of those fringe indies with earnest integrity which flies in the face of limited market appeal . An enjoyable watch for those into films about quirky , down-and-out type characters . (
587662	783721	308593	6.0	Over touted	" Monk " is a comedy-drama , with the emphasis on comedy , which tells of a San Francisco detective-savant with Sherlock Holmesian abilities and obsessive-compulsive disorder . The result is a peculiar sort of super cop who has to have a babe sidekick / babysitter to help him make it through the day . " Monk " is a lukewarm sitcom quality watch which is entertaining but something which probably will not pass the test of time in the dog-eat-dog world of television . Worth a look if the premise sound interesting but not all " that " . (
585831	783721	110306	6.0	A touching drama about strange bedfellows for mature audiences	" The Last Good Time " tells of an elderly retired concert violinist ( Mueller-Stahl ) who lives on a meager pension alone in a modest flat and takes in a streetwise young woman ( d'Abo ) on the run from a scurrilous boyfriend . A bittersweet and poignant drama , " TLGT " shows the brief , tenuous , but beautiful coming together of two very opposite people with no more in common than their humanity . Well worth a look for the mature viewer .
586504	783721	296658	6.0	Meow	" Take Care of my Cat " traces the activities and vicissitudes of a diverse group of five best friend female high school grads in South Korea as they embark upon life as adults . This film quietly passes on the sensational exploitation of sex , drugs , etc . one would expect to find in a similar American film as it moves quietly through its over-the-shoulder examination of the issues confronted and the choices made . What this film lacks in substance it may make up for in its real , fresh , and even presentation . On the other hand , if following a gaggle of Korean teens around shopping malls while they yack on their cell phones doesn't sound interesting to you , perhaps you should find another film . (
585658	783721	120521	6.0	A beautiful bit of nothing .	" The Winter Guest " is a beautifully filmed nothing of a story . As though on a carousel , the camera revolves around four pairs of people in an icy rural coastal place in Scotland , providing glimpses into their lives as it passes by in near real time . The absence of a story begs the question , why would one watch this film when they could be watching more interesting events simply by looking at their own lives ? The answer is probably " art for art's sake " .
586698	783721	254455	6.0	A earnest misfire somewhere between prose and the paranormal	" Sex and Lucia " is a subtitled drama out of Spain which swirls around a head-to-toe scrumptious Vega as it wends its way circuitously through its convoluted plot . Unfortunately the story can't reach out and grab the audience in spite of fine performances and good everything else because the emphasis is not on the players but on the diddled up storyline which is about as interesting as a mobius strip . In short , the film messes with the time domain which is more confounding than engrossing , more novel than substantive , and , after a 2 + hour run , wears out more than wraps up . An honest , sincere misfire , this flick will be of most interest to those into Eurodramas with tastefully done sex , nudity , and French angst . (
586190	783721	256380	7.0	Wow ! Gwyneth really had to gain weight for this flick .	" Shallow Hal " is yet another fresh , creative , and controversial comedy from the Farrlley Brothers . With Black in the title role as a superficial dating single , the film shows us what happens when self-help guru Tony Robbins gives Hal a post-hypnotic suggestion which changes his perception such that everyone's outward appearance is in rapport with their inner beauty . An intelligent flick which illustrates the strange similarity between comedy and tragedy , " Shallow Hal " is a love it or hate it flick which has left many saying " I don't get it " . The only way to find out if you'll get it is to watch it .
586479	783721	316465	7.0	Heartwarmer	" Radio " is a fictional fact-based account of the relationship which develops between a South Carolina small town high school athletic director ( Harris ) and a mentally challenged black man ( Gooding ) . There's little going on in this sweetly sentimental film which juxtaposes campus life and football with family life and one man's life altering experience through a very rewarding though unlikely friendship . Oscar winner Gooding earned a Razzie nom for his portrayal while the critics pounded the film for it's sappy cornball approach to story telling and Gooding's exaggeration of his character . Nonetheless , the film earned respectable marks from the paying public who were touched by the heartwarming tale of a different kind of relationship . For sentimentalists only . ( B )
586848	783721	337960	7.0	Lotsa heart	" Danny Deckchair " tells of the adventures of a young concrete truck driver who decides to tie a bunch of helium filled balloons to his deck chair to soar aloft . His plan is to take shears with him to cut away one balloon at a time thereby making his descent . Instead , he leaves the shears behind and the balloons carry him to a new life and a new love . This sweet , cute , fun little flick from down-under is a fresh and creative new addition to the much over worked romcom genre . With lots of heart and unpredictable predictability , " Danny Deckchair " should be an enjoyable watch for those who don't mind a little schmaltz with their romantic comedy fare . ( B )
586529	783721	256103	7.0	The absence of love	" Intimacy " tells of a divorced man and a married woman who have weekly loveless sex while each knows little of the other . The film explores the " why " of their peculiar relationship and follows the pair of protags to their inevitable conclusion . Whatever you know , think , or read about this film , it does break new ground as it pushes legitimate cinema one small measure toward its destiny by illuminating that dark corner of human behavior currently occupied only by pornography . Be prepared for graphic sex / nudity and some intensely personal scenes in a stark , austere , somewhat depressing but very courageous drama . Not for prudes , " Intimacy " will be most enjoyed by mature drama enthusiasts . ( B )
585948	783721	427157	7.0	Everything you ever wanted to know about the " dirty bomb "	The BBC and HBO teamed up to create " Dirty War " , a 90 minute TV movie about a terrorist " dirty bomb " attack in London . The film gets down to business quickly as it packs both the terrorist and the government anti-terrorist efforts into the film leaving little room for human interest subplots . On the terrorist side we follow the bomb from the smuggling of radioactive materials to assembly to deployment to detonation . On the government side we see PR and training exercises , intelligence gathering and analysis , interdiction , post-detonation response , and follow up . The film also imparts a sense of how Al-Qa'ida type terrorist cells are organized , the radical Islamic terrorist mentality , and terrorist strategies . A sort of anatomy of a " dirty bomb " incident , " Dirty War " will answer many questions lurking in the minds of a public becoming ever more aware of this insidious threat . ( B )
587513	783721	264464	7.0	How to get a job with the FBI	" Catch Me If You Can " tells the story of Frank Abagnale , con man . With Spielberg in the director's chair and A-listers leading the way , you'd expect something a little better than this story about a kid who conned his way into jobs as a Pan Am pilot , a lawyer , a doctor , and into some serious money . Reasonably entertaining and well crafted , this film runs a tad long and is smeared with comedic overtones making it difficult to take seriously . It might have worked better as a serious rather than playful drama . Nonetheless , worth a look by anyone interested in stories about scamming . ( B ) Note - If you like this flick , you might want to check out Tony Curtis in " The Great Imposter " ( 1961 )
587090	783721	217505	7.0	Over-wrought melodramatic history-fiction mishmash .	" Gangs of New York " mixes real American history with a weak fictional human drama and a thick coat of Hollywoodization resulting in an over wrought behemoth wannabe epic misfire . Scorcese pulls together bits and pieces of the Civil War conscription act , Irish potato famine immigration , Tammany Hall and Tweed corruption , race / slave issues , slum gangs , etc . and creates a milieu which has an off-target post-apocalyptic sort of feel and then tries to cram DiCaprio down our throats as a hero though he does nothing particularly heroic in the context of the film . The flick features blood and guts street riots reminiscent of " Braveheart " , a romance which doesn't work , an evil guy over acted by Day-Lewis and little else save a whole bunch of filler to give us a taste of the times and milk the extravagance for all its worth . In spite of all that , " Gangs . . . " received several Oscar noms and a thumb and a half up from critical corners with so-so approval from the public . Okay for fans of the principals and others into Hollywood blockbusters . Not for the jaded or those looking for substance or sophistication . ( B )
585762	783721	104685	7.0	What happens when you realize you don't like the people you love ?	" . . . Chez Nous " looks at this compelling question through the life of one Aussie woman who's self esteem is constantly undermined by the men in her life . This film is a psychodramatic , realistic , and intelligent look at the clockworks of a nuclear family held together more by mutual need than love and respect . The camera studies the slow disintegration of the family unit and the rebirth of Beth ( Harrow ) , the principle character . Well made , earnest , honest , and insightful . An interesting watch for more mature audiences .
586949	783721	252287	7.0	Interesting , entertaining , and copasetic .	" Bojangles " tells the story of legendary hoofer Bill Robinson who tapped his way to stardom and success as America's highest paid black entertainer only to die penniless . Hines brings charisma , charm , and lots of great tappin ' to the title role in this polished and sanitized biography . A fun watch especially for those who love tappin ' .
586002	783721	104812	7.0	Sweet stuff for romantics and sentimentalists	In " Map of the Human Heart " , a down and out middle aged Eskimo man recounts his life story to an Arctic cartographer ( Cusack , who has only a few minutes on screen ) which constitutes the bulk of the film via flashback . His story begins with his puppy love relationship with a young half-breed girl in a hospital . From there the adorable child couple are torn apart only to have fate bring them together again as adults under the less than idyllic circumstances of WWII . The film meanders from the dramatic to the poignant to the romantic to the horrific and back to square one where it continues the story in present day . Beautifully filmed and well executed though a bit clumsy at times , " Map . . . " spackles up its many plot holes and provides a thoughtful fantasy camouflage for its lack of resolution in the end while serving up very pretty Kodak moments such as making love on a barrage balloon or dancing in the rafters high above an orchestra . " Map . . . " is sweet stuff for romantics and sentimentalists who can overlook it continuity and credibility issues in the interest of the human heart . ( B )
586410	783721	109842	7.0	Checkmate !	" Fresh " ( Nelson ) , the title character and a black kid in his early teens , is a runner for low level drug distributors in the mean streets of NYC with a plan to get out of the ghetto . He plays speed chess with his estranged father and stashes money in a tin can but his plan goes well beyond just saving for a bus ticket . " Fresh " offers good production value , par performances , somewhat stereotypical characters , and lots of grit . However , what sets this critically lauded flick apart from its peers is a human drama with a clever storyline which transcend the usual stuck-in-the-ghetto flicks full of sensational crime stuff . An engaging watch for those into drug / ghetto / crime flicks . ( B )
586087	783721	106489	7.0	Yous got a problem wid dis ?	Set in an Italian neighborhood of the Bronx in the 60's , " A Bronx Tale " is a coming of age flick about a boy ( Capra / Brancato ) who becomes a protege of the urbane boss of the hood ( Palminteri ) after refusing to rat him out to the cops for a shooting . From there the boy gets some serious lessons in life in the hood under the wary and watchful eye of his hard working bus driver father ( Dinero ) . Dinero's directorial debut , this film is a by-the-numbers production with a slew of stereotypical mob type caricatures and histrionics which echo of Palminteri's stage play which offers some solid light dramatic entertainment . Not too be taken seriously , " A Bronx Tale " will be a worthwhile watch for those into wise guy flicks with some heart . ( B )
586739	783721	244094	7.0	I laughed my a off . Thanks Eric , I'm now ale !	" Never Again " tells of a single middle aged man ( Tambor ) and woman ( Clayburgh ) who find each other , have good sex , and then begin to wrestle with issues as they search warily for deeper meaning . The film jerks from the outlandish to the sublime and back again making for an unpredictably bumpy ride while conjuring moments of hilarity and warmth . " Never Again " is another Schaeffer love it or hate it flick which is the work of a creative genius or sexually obsessed hack depending on who you talk to . Given its middle aged focus and explicit sexual content , " Never Again " will play best with more mature audiences who can handle vulgar language , absurd comic relief , and still appreciate the sentimental and poignant moments without rationalization . ( B )
587669	783721	417001	7.0	What's not to like ?	Sarah ( Lane ) , the film's centerpiece , is fortyish , recently divorced , and , of course , cringing at the prospect of getting back into the dating game . The body of the film is all about Sarah , surrounded by assorted kith and kin , struggling to cope with the difficult process of finding Mr . Right . A light hearted romp which is just a new take on an old but tried and true premise , " Must Love Dogs " avoids the extremes of edginess , quirkiness , schmaltz , and corn and concentrates on just being a pleasant up-beat ride to a foregone conclusion . Hard not to like but not likely to be memorable , this little bit of fluff got respectable though nominal marks from IMDb . com's voters including an average score from that hardest of all demographics to please , the 30-44 age of disillusionment group . " Must Love Dogs " should play well with females and their significant others , Lane and Cusak fans , and anyone in the mood for a low cal romcom DVD watch . ( B )
586481	783721	315983	7.0	So ?	In his review of this film , Roger Ebert begins " It's so rare to find a movie that doesn't take sides . " Well , DUH ! People like movies that take sides . . . as in the good guys and bad guys . We like heroes and villains because we want to see good win over evil . " House of Sand and Fog " doesn't take sides which is its liability . The film builds its base of three characters ( Kingsley , Connelly , Eldard ) piecemeal developing Kingsley as a highly principled Iranian-American best while leaving protag Connelly as a kind of misguided whack-job and her lover ( Eldard ) as an unlikely trouble making deputy sheriff . On the upside , this well directed piece with a solid cast is moody and manages to whet and hold interest throughout by creating a succession of unresolved issues . On the downside , it doesn't " take sides " and give us someone to care about leaving the audience somewhat disconnected . The principals all seem misguided and responsible for their own problems so watching them stew in their own juices with many questions left unanswered makes for a somewhat unsatisfying viewing experience . For fans and drama junkies only . ( B )
586828	783721	153464	7.0	Intelligent , sophisticated , and elegant drama-lite .	" Up At the Villa " is a plodding , understated , dialogue-intensive " little " drama about love , sex , misdeeds , and other intrigues of decadent British aristocrats occupying Florence , Italy in days prior to WWII . Built around the Thomas character , what the film lacks in depth it makes up for with a well crafted script , excellent performances , and grand scenery .
586776	783721	244244	7.0	See Travolta smirk . See Berry's boobs . See Jackman type . See . . .	" Swordfish " is a rock'em , sock'em action no-brainer with Travolta as a deliciously likeable villain , Berry as a deliciously topless DEA agent , Jackman as a the world's faster typist , and Cheadle as an FBI agent . Not to be taken seriously , this flick rocks with all the stuff we've come to expect from Hollyweird . . . star power , stunts , pyro , visual effects , busses flying , bullets whizzing , cars crashing , yadayadayada . A must see for action junkies and enjoyable mindless escapism for others . Note - the plot , feeble as it may be , is eerily more poignant since 9-11 .
585862	783721	253200	7.0	Sentimental old guy ensemble flick	Jack's ( Caine ) ashes are in the urn and the company of his old friends and pub mates as " Last Orders " recounts Jack's life via reminiscing and flashbacks . Jack's life was not sufficiently interesting to make this film worthy . Rather , the sweetness and beauty of " Last Orders " comes from the nostalgia , remembrances , and sentimental reflection of the players , the old duffers , as they haul Jack to his final destination . An excellent ensemble film which will most likely appeal to more mature males . ( B ) Note - Be prepared for thick British accents and lots of jargon with which you may not be familiar . I viewed this flick with subtitles for language support .
586406	783721	110308	7.0	What a hctib !	" The Last Seduction " is all about Fiorentino , a NYC hardened vixen and man-ipulator who spends the whole flick using her guile and unscrupulous ways to separate her husband from their his ill gotten gains . A well crafted , well cast , and not-to-be-taken-seriously darkish flick which gets out of the blocks quick and keeps you thinking and guessing all the way to the conclusion . Light entertainment for adults on cable .
586473	783721	116692	7.0	A warm , sincere look at a musical prodigy's struggle with her parent's handicap	" Beyond Silence " is a tender look at the rift which develops between a young girl and her deaf parents as she and her interest in the clarinet grow . The film delivers it's story with a soft touch , avoiding extremes while maintaining an earnest sense of legitimacy . Excepting a few minor glitches , the film is technically and artistically well done , the acting good , the directing superb , and the story warm and thoughtful . A worthwhile watch .
587065	783721	279778	7.0	A chick flick for all seasons	A chick flick for chicks of all ages , " The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood " tells of four Louisiana ladies who establish their secret Ya-Ya sisterhood , bound by blood and oath and honor , at a young age and who remain friends over the years providing each other with friendship and support . The film's thin storyline is about one such " sister " ( Burstyn / Judd ) who has issues with her adult daughter ( Bullock ) and her sister Ya-Ya's who come to her rescue much to her dismay . What ensues is a warmly funny kind of jambalaya which makes up for its gaping plotholes with personality , charm , and rambunciousness as it stumbles through it story finally arriving gasping and wheezing at its feel good conclusion . Gagging material for grinches , most will find the " Ya-Yas " are just too damned much fun not to like on some level . ( B )
587225	783721	215750	7.0	American & Brit actors play Soviets & Germans . Duh !	Excellent production talent provides a gritty war-torn backdrop reminiscent of " Saving Private Ryan " for this weak story and poor historical account of the Battle for Stalingrad , a pivotal fight in the WWII European theater . The film tells of a Soviet war hero and sniper ( Law ) who squares off against a dogged adversary and top German sniper ( Harris ) providing the suspense and intrigue . The love story is played out like a clumsy after-thought and the use of big name stars for box office bucks when many good European actors could have added realism to the film was a typically self-serving Hollywood decision . Hoskins playing Khrushchev with his limey accent was laughable not to mention Harris as a German or Law as a Soviet and no attempt to fake an accent by anyone . A typical could-have-been-better flick which will entertain the masses and make the money mongers of filmdom happy while movie purists grumble .
587694	783721	101318	8.0	Ahhh ! Those French !	Never mind they do drugs , vandalize , rob and steal , try to kill each other , whack one dude and torch another . After all , it amour that counts , right ? " The Lovers on the Bridge " is a look into lives of a couple of down-and-out street bums who call a Paris bridge home . The film does an excellent job of telling it's 2 hour long story and the peculiar sort of " trouble loves company " kind of relationship which abides the two principles played by Levant and Binochet . Most will get lost in the pathos of this compelling and well constructed love story of sorts . Others may find it takes too long to get to the " feel good " part .
585767	783721	210075	8.0	Ever wonder why women want to box ? Well , here's one answer .	" Girlfight " follows a project dwelling New York high school girl from a sense of futility into the world of amateur boxing where she finds self esteem , purpose , and much more . Although the film is not about boxing , boxing is all about the film . So much so you can almost smell the sweat . Technically and artistically a good shoot with an sense of honesty and reality about it , " Girlfight " is no chick flick and no " Rocky " . It is , rather , a very human drama which even viewers who don't know boxing will be able to connect with .
587079	783721	276751	8.0	Shallow Hugh	" About a Boy " is a Brit flick about a happily eligible and independently well off bachelor ( Grant ) who learns from a boy ( Hoult ) that his self absorbed life may be needing something more . Clever , wry , and witty with plaudits aplenty , the fun in this flick is in the slightly skewed and skewering take on the shallow protagonist . There's are some poignant moments but precious little romance in this tale of one man's awakening from a life of sleep walking and the discovery that a man can be an island unto himself as long as he's part of an archipelago .

587425	783721	369339	8.0	One night in L . A .	In " Collateral " , an icy contract killer ( Cruise ) hijacks a cabbie ( Foxx ) who he forces to drive him around L . A . while he makes his stops to take care of business . The film neatly knits a scant human story including a babe and some cops with action , drama , suspense , and intrigues into an engrossing if not spellbinding two hour tale . When all is said and done , this taut action / drama ties up all loose ends including the question : Why would a hit-man hire a cabbie to drive him around L . A . instead of renting a car thereby eliminating the hostage / witness problem ? And , although " Collateral " doesn't break any new ground and does follow the Hollywood play-book to the letter , it is sufficiently intelligent , busy , unpredictable , and entertaining to be a worthwhile watch for anyone into cop / killer flix .

587482	783721	364961	8.0	A spellbinder for psychodrama fans	" The Assassination of Richard Nixon " is all about Penn as a mentally challenged man who , in spite of his best efforts , finds his life unraveling . The film is an in-depth study of the Penn character and reveals a kind of person not often examined in film . The character is a man living his life in that gray area between normal and abnormal with impaired mental capacity , low IQ , who looks and acts like everyone else but has difficulty understanding the complex relationships in life . Carrying the burden of guilt for his failures , low self-esteem for his handicap , and swelling anger from his frustrations , he focuses on the American political establishment as the source of his problems and sets about to kill the president . An excellent film in all respects based on real life events , this tour de force by Penn received only good marks from public and critics , probably owing to a lack of appreciation for or interest in the psychodynamics of the central character . Nevertheless this film is a must see for Penn fans and anyone into psychodramas . Those into " going postal " flicks might want to also check out Michael Douglas in " Falling Down " . (
586434	783721	144201	8.0	Man , woman , knives , love .	An artfully shot , black and white contemporary French film , " Girl on the Bridge " is a peculiar sort of romantic drama about a man and a woman bound together by an alloy of danger , fatalism , luck , libidos , and sharp steel . On one level the film is preposterous ; on another , implausible ; and yet on another a compelling , fantastic drama . A good watch for the jaded .
586665	783721	116790	8.0	Needed relief from the excesses of Hollywood .	" Kolya " , an award winning Czech film set in Prague , is a sweet and sentimental story about a boy ( the title character ) and a male cellist who , through circumstance , becomes his guardian . Set against a backdrop of Czech countryside and the architecture of Prague , this well crafted and wistful tale is a worthwhile 100 minute watch for those in need of relief from the numbing excesses of Hollywood blockbusters . Potentially enjoyable by all , " Kolya " will be most appreciated by mature audiences , particularly those who favor European films .
585937	783721	335266	9.0	A mirror of nuances	" Lost in Translation " is by all accounts a huge film . Telling of a 50-something married man ( Murray ) and a 20ish married woman ( Johansson ) - both Americans stuck in a hotel in Tokyo with too much time on their hands - who come together to soothe the yearning they both have for companionship , " Lost . . . . " is a sometimes funny , sometimes poignant , and always sensitive look at the importance of being human . Masterfully struck from little more than nuances with slick art and technicals , this Coppola coup will tell you more about who you are than about the two principals . " Lost in Translation " will speak most loudly to anyone who has ever experienced the love which could never be . ( A )
586355	783721	200276	10.0	The best ever ?	" The West Wing " is quite possibly the best TV series ever . Consider that the series avoids the usual cheap shot ratings boosters such as soapy melodrama , sex , violence , romcom cheese , silly fluff , etc . . Consider the series has been smartened up as opposed to dumbed down , something which would sink most shows which had to play to the average prime time sofa spud . Consider that the series serves up ample helpings of American history , inside the beltway political strategizing , lobbying and wrangling , and much more of those things which were all big turn-offs in high school civics class . Consider that the cast is rock solid but not the most glamorous bunch of megastars to hit the small screen . Consider that the series never loses sight of the importance of high minded principles and delivers family value subliminals as well as a strong sense of ethics in government and morality in life . Consider that the series conjures moments of wit , drama , sentiment , and poignancy in big doses in almost every episode . Consider that because of and in spite of the above , " The West Wing " has been enormously popular with critics and public alike and garnered a substantial brace of awards . No series can be all things to all people . However , " The West Wing " is likely more things to more people than any series to come before it . (
