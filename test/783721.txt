586319	783721	240944	3.0	Think " The Substitute " couldn't get any worse ? ?	Guess again . " The Substitute IV " is an even more sophomoric knock-off of it's predecessors . While most sequels try to capitalize on whatever the original had going for it , " Sub IV " doesn't seem to care that it ever had anything going for it as it departs from the " Kick-ass High School teacher takes on punks " theme and wanders mindlessly into a military academy breeding white supremacist cadettes . Everything about this film is sub-B junk from the silly plot to the poor acting to the cheesy action scenes . Williams must have really been hungry to have taken on this flop which should kill whatever market the previous sequels managed to scrounge up . This is one for the dumpster .
586744	783721	160611	3.0	An abysmal failure	" Ordinary Decent Criminal " is sad because it is obviously trying to succeed and equally obviously hasn't a chance in hell of making it apparently owing to the absence of a clear sense of purpose . A abysmal failure at droll Irish comedy with Spacey as a thief who enjoys outsmarting the cops and his competition becoming a sort of folk hero in his own mind , this flick manages to be mildly amusing when it's trying to be funny , slightly more than boring when it's trying to be interesting , and forget sentimental or poignant or endearing though it takes shots at those qualities as well . " Ordinary Decent Criminal " has a clumsy screenplay , naive direction , journeyman execution , thin story , poor casting , mediocre acting , and eventually becomes lost in itself and sinks into a mire of hopeless mediocrity . Pass on this one . ( D )
587602	783721	160184	3.0	Whadda bunch of crap !	In " Eye See You " , Sly plays an FBI agent who crawls into a bottle after burning out and then goes into detox with a bunch of alcoholic and / or suicidal cops in a remote facility in the dead of winter . From there people are murderer and Stallone has to stop the killer and save the token babe ( Walker ) . This flick suffers from a hackneyed story , atmospherics so oppressive its difficult to see the action , and the absence of anything new , creative , or interesting . " ESY " is just a drone of meaningless Hollywoodish busyness which fails on all levels . Not recommendable and another big step down for Stallone who should take lessons from Eastwood on aging gracefully in the film biz . ( D )
586754	783721	201479	3.0	A waste of talent and time .	" Beyond the City Limits " is a good example of how not to make a movie . Director Gaston manages to lead her decent cast into a sort of mindless oblivion where nothing works . An uneven conglomerated mess of lousy acting , directing , editing , cinematography , music , etc . , this uninspired doggie can't seem to find a genre and stick with it . If this is the only movie on t . v . , just turn the box off and play solitaire . Yuck ! ( D )

587464	783721	249380	3.0	Boring	" Baise Moi " ( Kiss Me ) tells of two young women who go on a killing and fking spree . So , there's lots of killing and some graphic sex ( penetration , oral , etc . ) . Add to those two elements a pretty awful production with color shifts , graininess , lousy editing , poor effects , etc . ; unbelievable characterizations ; and other problems to numerous to mention here and you have your basic porn flick . Worst of all , there isn't enough sex for it to be good porn and too little story for it to be anything else . Conclusion ? Don't waste your time . ( D )
586620	783721	256374	4.0	Gratuitous garbage	" Pretty When You Cry " is a klunker from beginning to end . Shot as a dark and brooding drama , this B-flick tells it's story of sex , drugs , and murder through a series of annoying flashbacks . Character development is nonexistent , the story weak and uninteresting , and the acting very ordinary . Cinematography is okay but can't save this very mediocre flick which is like a bowl of wax fruit : Looks good but you wouldn't want to eat it . A waste of time .
586983	783721	261270	4.0	Same old stuff . . new location .	" Samia " tells an old story about a teenager who rebels against her family values asserting her demands to be her own person . In the case of " Samia " , the teen is an Algerian girl living with a traditional Muslim family in France . During this short film we get to see Samia sulking , fighting with her brother , sulking , hanging out with friends , sulking , going to the seashore , sulking , refusing to have her hymen examined and , yeah , more sulking . The film shows some traditional and presumably Algerian costuming , dancing , music , meals , etc . in this little indie sorely lacking in story and execution . Pass on Samia . ( Note : The version I Tivo'd had white subtitles with no outline making it very difficult to read the white words on light backgrounds .
585638	783721	205271	4.0	Perhaps Altman's greatest . . . . dud .	Gere makes an appropriate centerpiece for this shallow and trite comedy about an OB / GYN and the many women in his life . The plotless film touches on all things female from birth to menopause to marriage to lesbianism . . . etc . Unfortunately its all-star female cast is reduced to playing silly , prattling , snoopy , ditzy , shallow , vain , self absorbed , neurotic stereotypes while the film meanders with no apparent purpose through a seemingly endless 2 hour run time . One can only wonder what the hell was Altman thinking when he made this dud . PU !
585600	783721	257850	4.0	Misuse of star power with luke warm results .	I sat through " Boy's Don't Cry " wholly involved emotionally , empathizing with the characters , feeling the horror , indignation , etc . On the other hand , I sat through " The Laramie Project " asking myself , " Who's that actor . . . oh , yeah , that's the guy from ' Happiness ' " or " Jeeez , Garafolo's looking older " . . . . etc . Bottom line ; this film may have a noble purpose but it is entirely less efficacious than a drama or a real documentary . " TLP " is a misfire .

The film is long on talent but so short on story one can only wonder how it ever got into production much less distribution . Slow , monotonous , boring , and dumb , " Desert Blue " is one of those B-flicks which one watches with detachment always cognizant of the fact the characters are actors going through the motions required for their paycheck . For fans only . ( C )
587621	783721	122529	5.0	A pretentious , pseudointellectual mediocre indie .	" Henry Fool " tells of a stoic young garbage man who is encouraged to write poetry by a transient dilettante , Henry Fool . The story has little substance and , with the exception of the principals , is cluttered with sundry characters who serve no useful purpose and whom were not made to care about anyway . The plot is simpleminded and the story not particularly entertaining . There are no underlying morals of any significance and the end is a meaningless truncation . There is little art value in the film which pretentiously takes itself much too seriously . Watching this flick is like waiting for the other shoe to drop for 2 . 5 hours only to find out it was a one legged film . I'm not sure who would appreciate this flick . College students or indie freaks maybe .
586733	783721	209958	5.0	A colossal mess of a movie .	The up side of " The Cell " is good casting , special effects , acting , etc . The downside of this masterpiece of surreal cinematic junk food is the story which is no more than another trite serial killer drama with a sci-fi twist which comes off like an excuse , not a reason , for special effects . The film may find a market among viewers who can get past the ridiculous premise and plot . Others will regard this as another sad waste of excellent talent on a flick which is a schizophrenic as it's villain .
587164	783721	233142	5.0	What a waste .	" 3000 Miles to Graceland " is a testosterone drenched junk flick with story which doesn't work , numbing excesses of mindless action , and a huge waste of star power and budget bucks . Deserving of the numerous Razzie nominations it garnered , this is one for the dumpster . Nuff said .
587560	783721	95333	5.0	Bland , obvious , and lacking in chemistry and personality .	Not unlike a simple-minded Nancy Drew , McGillis plays a nosey but reluctant witness to Nazi war criminal underground railroad skullduggery who foils countless bad guys while falling in like with an FBI agent ( Daniels ) who doesn't carry a gun because they're too heavy . Yeah , right . Good old fashioned melodrama , " The House on Carroll Street " is a stagey , obvious , scripted , stiff , and sanitized for your protection . Recommended for viewers who prefer melodrama over reality .
586194	783721	285917	5.0	Fire cop or fire bug ?	" Point of Origin " takes the viewer into the life of a workaholic top Los Angeles arson investigator ( Liotta ) who is married with children , having some extracurricular activity on the side , writing a book , and investigating a serial arson case . Jeesh , talk about burning the candle at both ends ! On the upside , this HBO product has a promising plot with some twisty-turny stuff . However , pinched at the end , fraught with plot holes , and cluttered with surreal visual effects , " Point of Origin " is likely to ignite little interest beyond that of the wayward channel surfer .
585734	783721	100797	5.0	A poor telling of a socially significant story	" Too Young to Die " tells of an attractive young woman of low intelligence who's raised by a degenerate mother in a low class environment and sexually abused by men resulting in tragedy . This unfortunate flick has a story of some social significance but fails to bring it to the screen with the bitter reality , heart and compassion is deserves . Lewis and Pitt offer good performances but the film suffers from melodrama , stereotypical clichés , poor directing , and a mediocre screen play with an obvious made-for-tv presentation . Recommended only for those interested in the early work of Lewis and Pitt .
586183	783721	137036	5.0	Shoestring indie snoozer	Jerome , AZ is the destination of this road trip flick about a not too bright welder who walks off the job , leaves his family , and hits the road in his boss's car . A shoestring indie , " Jerome " is one of those shallow character-driven dramas where the camera lingers endlessly over every scene as though we're supposed to be wallowing in the pathos of the moment when we're really just getting bored out of our socks . Not totally unsatisfying , this flick delivers too little too late and in the end and seems to have no purpose other than showing us how much trouble a guy can get into by simply passively defaulting to the consequences of situations as they arise . For indie lovers only .
587579	783721	96200	5.0	Booooooring !	" Sweet Hearts Dance " is about a two couples . . . one married , one not . Beyond that there's little worth mentioning . Although the film sports a good cast and is an okay production , it is a movie in need of a story as it wanders from chapter to chapter exploring the vicissitudes of a quartet of people who are probably much less interesting that yourself . In a word . . . . boring .
587369	783721	265208	5.0	A movie only a teenager could love	" The Girl Next Door " is one long series of excuses for serving up huge helpings of sex in an apparent attempt to separate the tween / teen male from the price of admission . This very unromantic lol free comedy tells of an about-to-grad HS student body prez who falls for the house sitting babe next door and then learns she's a porn star and sets about to save her from herself so she can be the person she really wants to be . ( Ahem ) Hirsch makes a suitable centerpiece while Cuthbert provides the babe-a-licious eye candy as this lame comedy only a teen could love kerchunks though huge gulps of sex obsessed filler . Scoffed at by the critics with poor marks from mature adults , this flick is fodder for teens chock full of shameful subliminals , T & A , and sex talk . A guaranteed winner for teen males and their bimbos and a loser for all others . ( C )
585999	783721	117821	5.0	Nothing new	In the grand scheme of martial arts movies , " Tai Chi II " ( not a sequel ) is junk . However , for martial arts enthusiasts it might qualify as a B-flick . A sort of dramady about a young Chinese puritan student who wants to win the affections of a hottie while ridding his land of the evils of opium , this flick breaks no new ground as it finds one excuse after another for Wu to do all the same old tired Kung Fu moves we seen a gazillion times before . . . with the exception using his braid like a whip ( yeah , right ) . Save some pretty scenery including Chung and identifying some of the Tai Chi position used during the fight ( eg : leaping lizard , holy cow , etc . ) , this flick is pure cornball Kung Fu with the same sound effect used for every punch , missed-by-a-mile choreography , and lame wire fu . Lacking the grit of Bruce Lee , the inventiveness and personality of Jackie Chan , and the elegance of " Crouching Tiger . . . " , " Tai Chi II " is just more junk food for martial art film freaks . ( C )
587006	783721	210616	5.0	A weak film lacking the passion of it's subject .	" Center Stage " , a film about young students of the ballet trying to succeed , is diluted by too many characters ( most of them sophomoric stereotypes ) and soapy subplots and plagued by bad acting , melodrama , juvenile music , and even mediocre choreography . The film lacks the verve and passion of the art it attempts to represent though it does showcase plenty of dancing . This flick will be appreciated most by young females and dance enthusiasts .
587010	783721	144557	5.0	College comedy romp slightly above average for a novice indie	" Puddle Cruiser " is slightly more clever than your average low budget novice indie . Amusing , somewhat wacky , situational college comedy which is more fun than funny , this little campus romp avoids the usual raunch as it tells it's lightly romantic story . An okay watch for bored students .
586365	783721	342577	5.0	Well , the camera was in focus .	" Iran , Veiled Appearances " isn't much of a documentary . However , it does transport the viewer behind the Islamic curtain and offers a sense of what contemporary Iranian life is like . It begins with a dab of history including brief file footage of the Shah and the Ayatollah Khomeini before launching into an exploration of the Iran of today much like an inquisitive tourist rather than an investigation of political , social , and cultural orders . Too much time is spent dawdling over visual spectacles such as parades , martial arts training , a dance class , paragliding , etc . , all of which are done in other countries ( a minute on each would have sufficed ) . The interviews with Iranians are man-in-the-street type with college kids espousing liberal ideals as do college kids everywhere while elders preach the usual conservative doctrine . The schism between the theocratic fundamentalist elders and the more western-thinking youth came as no surprise . However , if we are seeing the seeds of change or revolution , we weren't shown the forces keeping a lid on it . Overall , the film was only marginally interesting , lacked traveloguesque scenic beauty , offered minimal history , had no interviews with officials , and conjured nothing which could be considered investigative reporting . Pass on this one unless you really yearn for a peek at Iran . ( Note - I have a theory which suggests Peter Sellers did not die but grew a beard , moved to Iran , changed his name to Khatami , and became President .
587430	783721	117608	5.0	A wild and crazy guy in uniform .	In this knock-off of the old Phil Silvers ' tv series , Martin plays Sergeant Bilko , a scam-artist who doesn't let being the head of an Army Post motorpool keep him from enjoying the luxuries of civilian life . A simple minded flick which shows us nothing new , " Sgt . Bilko " has little to offer save acting as a diversion for the needy couch potato . An okay watch for those who like Martin's " wild and crazy guy " schtick .
585842	783721	117283	5.0	Okay off-kilter slow mover .	" The Pallbearer " , a schizophrenic cross-genre muddling of comedy , drama , and romance with idiosyncratic characters and a thin , marginally interesting story . Schwimmer is at the center of this slow moving , somewhat quirky flick about a young man who lives with his mother ( Bosco anyone ? ) and courts a demure unassured girl ( Paltrow ) while having an affair with an older woman ( Hershey ) . Most will find it difficult to get their head into this off-kilter story and its subtle tongue-in-cheek humor though it remains loyal to its purpose throughout . . . whatever that may be .
586352	783721	362227	5.0	Ka-thunk ! !	" The Terminal " tells of an Eastern European man on a personal mission ( Hanks ) who becomes stuck in a NYC airport terminal because he doesn't have the proper papers to enter the US and cannot return to his home as his country suffered a coup while he was en route . Given it's pedigree , this film is a dud . Too long at 2 hours , full of filler and commercial product impressions , and very predictable throughout , " The Terminal " tries to build a story around the Hanks character including wooing a flight attendant ( Zeta-Jones ) while bathing in a public restroom , eating at BURGER KING , buying a HUGO BOSS suit , and carrying around his precious PLANTERS DRY ROASTED PEANUTS can , etc . With yawns from the critics and a lukewarm reception by the public , " The Terminal " is fodder for fans only . (
587629	783721	218624	5.0	A lukewarm two-part comedy about golf and football fans	" The Sports Pages " consists of two completely separate mini-movies in tandem . The first is a droll tale with Newhart on a courtroom witness stand explaining to a jury how he justifies killing an old friend and golfing companion ( Grammer ) by whacking him over the head with a club . Part two is a raucous tale about the " facts " behind the " Heidi Bowl " ( look it up ) . Neither film has much sporting action and both focus on the fans ( golf and football respectively ) . I don't care much for either sport and liked the first bit better . However , fans and nonfans alike should expect little more than a mildly amusing watch from " The Sports Pages " . (
586954	783721	161081	5.0	If you like this flick , get out your Ouija board .	" What Lies Beneath " offers a thin story , a weak plot , two of Hollywood's most over-rated stars , and little else . Things go bump in Pfeiffer's head as the camera lingers ad nauseum in one fabricated suspenseful moment after another and the perfectly perfect couple's encounter with the paranormal unfolds . The film is predictable and fails to compel the audience to make the necessary leap of faith required by all such spooky flicks . A big disappointment from Zamackis and a waste of time for all but the most avid supernatural junkies .
587596	783721	157183	5.0	A slice of Beirut life with no clear purpose or direction .	" West Beirut " is a plotless , non-story , non-documentary , meandering slice-of-life flick about a teenage boy's life in the early days of the Lebanese civil war when Beirut became divided into East and West . Although the film examines Beirut civilian life under the pall of war , it doesn't deal with any specific issue sufficiently to give it purpose . It's not particularly entertaining , evocative , or compelling ; does not chronicle events well ; is a poor study in history ; and is void of romance , mayhem , comedy , suspense , or any of the things which people go to movies to see . " West Beirut " has the " feel " of a make-it-up-as-you-go low budget journeyman drama . Recommended only for those with special interest in Lebanon .
586941	783721	398712	5.0	Same old stuff	" Assault on Precinct 13 " is an ordinary action / drama about a handful of cops , a couple of babes , and several criminals in a soon-to-be-defunct police station house on a dark and snowy New Year's eve who come under siege by a small army of bad guys who want to kill one of the prisoners to prevent him from testifying in court . On the inside of the of the besieged police station are a sergeant with issues ( Hawk ) and the high value prisoner ( Fishburne ) who team up to deal with the threat . On the outside is the equivalent of a SWAT team led by a ruthless killer ( Byrne ) . As this obviously contrived tale unfolds it becomes increasingly apparent it is just more of the same Hollywood B-movie material with nothing new to offer . There is , however , enough action to make for a lukewarm couch potato watch as long as the brain is disengaged and expectations are kept low . (
587610	783721	250425	5.0	A film for sentimentalists and Ving fans .	" Holiday Heart " attempts to be a touching lite drama about a burly drag queen who befriends a female druggie and her daughter . Rhames works hard to fit into his character and his dresses and , to his credit , pulls it off . The film in general is a little schmaltzy around the edges , makes obvious efforts to push the viewers buttons for the desired result , and tells a story which beyond the unique premise is unoriginal . Nonetheless , the viewer who sets skeptical analysis aside and goes with the flow may just become pleasantly engrossed in this heart warming tale of strange bedfellows .
586356	783721	250491	5.0	A wee flick	" Late Night Shopping " is a little , lukewarm Brit friends comedy which follows the lives and loves of a trio of young Glasgow guys who spend most of their time trying to figure out their lives and loves . The film wanders from pillar to post seemingly searching for its story until it settles on one couple and the reconciliation of some relationship-busting indiscretions . There's probably more right with " Late Night Shopping " than there is wrong with it , but it is not sufficient to warrant a trip to the video store . Unengaging , monotonous at times , but with a solid cast and an occasionally pang of poignancy or heart , this flick may have some appeal for young adults , Scots or Brits , fans of the players , etc . All else pass . ( C )

V . to ivy	" Homeless to Harvard " tells the true story of Liz Murray who went from living with her druggie parents in a Bronx slum and living on the street while dumpster diving for food to earning a degree at Harvard University . This gritty TV flick is narrated by Thora Birch who registers a sterling performance as the wan , slump shouldered , stringy haired teen protag whose mother's death from AIDS set her free to focus her brain power and determination on academic success . Though this film is a worthy testament to the success of Liz Murray it is , in the final analysis , just another rags to ( intellectual ) riches story . Not that big a deal with an obvious made-for-TV " feel " , " Homeless to Harvard " is inspirational fodder for teen females and a worthy watch for Birch fans . (
586762	783721	241025	6.0	Thackery goes Hollywood	" Vanity Fair " ( 2004 ) is an acceptable but abbreviated version of the classic Thackery Victorian period novel which tells of Becky Sharp ( Witherspoon ) , who uses artifice and charm to climb from lowly governess to aristocrat , always able to find a suitable family of peerage or property to use as a rung in her ladder to the top in spite of the tribulations of the time . At just over two hours , this film cannot deal in depth with the many characters in the story and has to content itself with hitting the high points which make for a very condensed telling suited to those who only wish the flavor of the story . Those with a particular interest in Victorian pulp fiction or more expansive dramas should turn to the BBC's 1998 six hour miniseries which offers greater character depth , a presentation much more true to the period , and a very much better cast .

586722	783721	252501	6.0	Too little , too late .	" Hearts in Atlantis " has all the makings of a first rate film . What could have been just a heart warming slice-of-life flick wanders sloth-like off into the paranormal threatening something ominous and foreboding and then poofs into the expected . The beginning and end with Morse is unnecessary footage and an obvious ploy to heighten feelings of nostalgia in the audience . Etc . Nonetheless , " Hearts . . . " is a beautifully shot and well acted film with faults sentimentalists can easily overlook . Too bad the story doesn't measure up .
586692	783721	295362	6.0	A convoluted mess	" Chaos " begins as story of a handyman and a married woman who conspire to extort money from the woman's husband by faking her kidnapping . But when the woman is murdered , the story begins a series of twists and becomes a cinematic pretzel . What is a stylish shoot with competence on both sides of the lens eventually sinks into a quagmire of convolution full unnecessary complications such as the Memento-like show-the-past-first incremental flow with important bits of information kept from the audience as a cheap ploy to create intrigue and mystery . The result is a movie which is likely to lose those who are busily reading subtitles which has a scant human story as it is too busy trying to untwist itself . Finally , this is not a thriller but a mystery . And the biggest mystery seems to be , why should we care ? A B-flick for Japanese movie buffs only . (
587569	783721	91188	6.0	Good but vague in purpose .	" Heartburn " has Mick Nichols at the helm with Streep and Nicholson starring and an excellent supporting cast including a bit debut by Kevin Spacy . In spite of all that , the film has only managed lukewarm commentary from critics and public alike . Taking a somewhat cynical look at marriage as it follows one couple ( Streep & Nicholson ) from nuptials through the birth of two children including infidelity , this well crafted flick muddles comedy with drama to a nebulous end . An enjoyable watch for mature people who've been there , " Heartburn " will likely disappoint others because of its uneventfulness and lack of purpose .
586475	783721	202677	6.0	A well staged gritty kidnap flick with limited appeal .	" The Way of the Gun " is a gritty , messy , bloody , dark kidnap B-flick in which the entire cast of characters is somewhere between wanton and downright evil . The film's plot is a twisty-turny convoluted kind of mess which asks more questions than it answers and may interest or even seduce viewers with an appetite for blood and guts crime films . The shootout scenes are fairly well staged , the script waxes philosophical in an ambiguous sort of way , and the movie does sort itself out in the end . Certainly not for everyone , this peculiar flick will find an audience among those with an appetite for the bizarre .
585943	783721	303714	6.0	Shines in the shop . Lackluster outside .	" Barbershop " is a sometimes hokey , sometimes fresh , and always likeable Afro-Am comedy about a motley bunch of haircutters in a 40 year old urban Chicago barbershop which has become a neighborhood institution of sorts . Though the film does have an underlying serious story and a silly side plot about a stolen ATM machine , they contribute little compared to the constant yammering amongst the shop's crew of cutters . Their diverse personalities , perspectives , and personal issues provide the film's doggerel-laced heart , charm , and warmth . A sequel set entirely inside the shop would be something to look forward to given the same core cast and writers . (
586206	783721	95467	6.0	A Polish artie	" A Short Story About Love " with its cast of two , not including a couple of side characters , is not short in length at 86 minutes but is short in stature as it lingers tediously over the tenuous relationship which develops between an immature and introverted postal worker and the attractive older woman he watches from his bedroom window through a telescope from across a courtyard as she cavorts nightly around her flat . A laconic sentimental flick with little to offer save the psychodynamics of a pair of peculiar characters , this tale of strange bedfellows is very well done for what it is , which ain't much . Sweet soup with no meat and potatoes or dessert , this is one for the artie crowd . (

" Soft Fruit " is a bittersweet Aussie flick about a terminally ill mother who summons her adult children to her bedside for her final days . Anything but a downer , this cross-genre flick shows us humor , poignancy , and quirkiness as we watch a barely functional and functional barely family deal with the passing of its matriarch . An enjoyable film , a critics darling , and a winner of some fringe awards , " Soft Fruit " is a worthwhile watch for those into flicks about working class Aussies .
587424	783721	364725	6.0	Still more Stiller	" Dodgeball " is another Stiller formula comedy which packs wacky characters and silly stereotypes into a story about a glitzy state-of-the-art health club owner ( Stiller ) who wants to add a failing garage gym , owned and operated by Vaughn , to his empire . Unwilling to give up his small time but nerd-friendly operation , Vaughn challenges Stiller to settle the dispute over a champion dodgeball tournament in Vegas . Factor in a babe and the usual good vs evil elements with the underdog issue and a screenplay which is hyperkinetic and kaleidoscopic and the result is an enjoyable comedy romp worth a look by anyone who enjoyed similar Stiller fare such as " Zoolander " or " Duplex " or " Starsky & Hutch " or " Envy " , etc .

Overall the film is a good production . However , the time travel thing makes it a bit unwieldy , squeezing the juicy stuff between a protracted setup and denouement while making the suspension of disbelief considerably more difficult than with conventional plots . Nonetheless , the film moves along quickly , spares us the usual dose of Kodak moments , and tightly knits its clever but cumbersome story . A fun watch for romantics and a possible disappointment for skeptics .

The extremely efficient , straight laced , married Captain , however , finds he has his hands full ( in more ways than one ) once his troop of hotties ( aka : Pantyland ) is deployed . With mixed reviews from the critics and respectable marks from the public , this fun little Peruvian dramady gets off to a slow start , runs a tad long at two hours , and is sexy , silly , sweaty , and sepia , making for a lukewarm watch which will appeal most to foreign film freaks into flicks from south of the border .

" tells of a T-Man who will stop at nothing to settle a score with a counterfeiter ( Dafoe ) who murdered his partner . A moody and very Hollywoodish action / drama , this film does little to distinguish itself , save one very good car chase , and plays out like just another cop vs bad guy movie . Petersen is too generic and vanilla and acts like a hyperactive Secret Service agent on meth . Funny money freak Dafoe is too stereotypical and acts like he's trying to be the personification of evil on ludes . The story is flawed with plot holes aplenty and obvious histrionics and the principal protag Petersen is too bad to be good , leaving the audience with no one to root for . Nonetheless , this flick received excellent reviews from critics with Ebert giving it a top four stars . Personally I couldn't remember anything about the film after 20 years , though I have vivid recollections of Friedkin's earlier " French Connection " . " Live & Die . . . " is fodder for TV action junkies but too old to be state-of-the-art and not good enough to be a classic . Watchable but passable . (

Sean Young gets a double Razzie nod for sleepwalking through her dual role in this journeyman thriller which sticks Matt Dillon out front as an upwardly mobile man who prefers to murder his way to the top of the corporate ladder . Full of contrivances and asking many questions while providing few answers , this mediocre rehash of a 1956 thriller makes for little more than a nominal couch potato no-brainer . Okay to zone to . (

A fun and festive flick with all manner of family issues expressed in and among the wedding preparations , this plotless film is a delightful hodgepodge of busy goings-on full of handsome folks in anxious anticipation the festivities . A delightful " happening " , " Monsoon Wedding " will score best with viewers into foreign films or with a specific interest in East Indian culture . (
587224	783721	192071	6.0	A good fun-flick for the 13-16 female crowd .	" Get Over It " is a silly little teen romantic comedy with a little bit of everything for the pubescent female . The flick includes some slapstick , situational humor , funny characters , and , of course , the requisite puppy love affair . At issue is not will Dunst hook up with the newly estranged and reluctantly footloose Foster , but rather when . Combine some funny shtick by the hilarious Martin Short and some really ultra-hip permissive parents played by Kurtz and Begley with a spritz of musical theater and I all spells fun for teens . " Get Over It " doesn't take itself too seriously and is what it is . . . a no brainer for bops .
587297	783721	183523	6.0	A solid flick in a difficult genre .	" Mission . . . " offers the audience a good cast , good special effects , good sets , some excellent production talent , and an interesting story . It builds from a hokey backyard barbecue opening to an outer space technodrama and waxes in the denouement to a ponderous fantasy . Overall the flick is solid entertainment . If " Mission . . . " has a problem , it's the daunting task of crossing the left-brain / right-brain barrier ( most people are one or the other and not both ) in a difficult genre .
587368	783721	362129	6.0	Old news	" Seeing Other People " is all about DINKs Alice ( Nicholson ) and Ed ( Mohr ) who have lived together for years and decide to try other sex partners before tying the knot . This obviously contrived premise yields an abundance of the same old relationship problems we've all seen before a zillion times giving the film the familiarity of old news as opposed to old friends . On the downside , this conversational flick uses a plethora of stereotypical side characters and plenty of not-so-subtle sex talk for filler while Ed and Alice are clumsily making their last ditch effort to get some " strange " . On the upside , the writing is sufficiently insightful and fresh to create enough moments of humor and fun to make for a worthwhile small screen watch . With average marks from critics and public , " SOP " will play best with younger adult females . Keep expectations real . (
586051	783721	226430	6.0	A mildly compelling B-flick with limited appeal	" Shadow Hours " is a well shot , well acted , impatient B-flick which gets moving quickly and keeps up the momentum throughout . Although the film is a journeyman production at best , it creates a curious mystique by asking more questions than it answers and keeps the audience guessing to the end and beyond . Weller's character is particularly compelling as he mentors a recovering addict , Getty , on life with a series of tours through the decadent underbelly of Los Angeles nightlife . Not for everyone , some will find this film provocative and will be looking forward to better offerings from this auteur in the future .

This film received mixed reviews from both critics and consumers for obvious reasons . Everything about the film is good except the telling of the story . In spite of all the pluses , Moll Flanders trudges so stoically through her ordinary life as to not whet the edge of the viewers interest but rather make a wonderfully produced film a tedious and boring watch punctuated with poignant moments barely sufficient to keep the waning eyelid open .
586576	783721	101761	6.0	For Doors fans only	Oliver Stone's " The Doors " tells of the rise to demise of Jim Morrison , lead for the title rock band , icon of the hippy culture , and celebrated / notorious / controversial rock musician . The film focuses on Morrison's brief six year career and features a fine performance by Kilmer , much of " The Doors " music , and plenty of Hollywood sensationalism . I watched the film as a matter of curiosity since I lived through the period but never really knew who Morrison was ( which pretty much makes me no expert ) and found myself doing a lot of fast forwarding through the music and concerts . Unfortunately , Morrison wasn't all that interesting making the film of questionable value to anyone who was not a " Doors " or Morrison fan .

( Cohen ) and an excon ( Morrow ) , both family men with problems , this series is a very smart and powerful uncompromising drama . Unpredictable , realistic , and believable , " Street Time " skillfully delivers a linear story crisscrossed with side plots and every episode jam-packed with serious , gritty , hardcore drama . Lacking the mediocrity demanded by the viewing public at large , " Street Time " is too good to last . (

The film is an excellent debut for writer / director Gray and , IMHO , much better than his follow-up work " The Yards " . " Little Odessa " may be short on story with an obvious absence of the tinselization which comes with big bucks , but it is also honest , unpretentious , and sports an excellent cast . Will play best with reality freaks into crime dramas . (
586644	783721	258000	6.0	A cheap thrill a minute	" The Panic Room " is a foible fraught suspense flick in which Foster's character and her daughter play cat and mouse with a trio of intruders in their Manhattan mansion for the full run . Lousy character development and a implausibilities up the wazoo , this film requires some serious dumbing down . However , it's busy enough with cheap thrills and a slick enough shoot to make it an reasonably entertaining couch potato watch . Turn off brain , go with the flow , and enjoy . (
587445	783721	105480	6.0	Southern discomfort	" Storyville " , from the outside looking in , is a poorly directed novel adaptation with Spader as a southern lawyer from a wealthy family - the only person in the film with no southern accent - who is running for Congress in the midst of a potentially damning scandal and murder mystery which he must overcome to win the House seat and purge the skeletons from his family's closet . Supposed to have been one of those steamy / sweaty New Orleans noir dramas where everyone knows evereyone else's business and they all have secrets , this film is a jambalaya of murder , sex , deceit , corruption , a couple of babes , courtroom drama , assorted strange / weird characters , token T & A , and even the kitchen sink in a sloppily concocted B-flick with little potential beyond a late night t . v . soporific . Watch this with a nightcap and you won't remember it in the morning . ( C )

In " House of Angels " , a staid , bucolic Swedish village is all abuzz when a lovely and vivacious young woman comes to town to claim the estate of her late grandfather . A charming , warmhearted , and fun little romp which is not so much a story as it is a study of human nature , the film seems to delight in evincing the community's eccentricities as it reverberates like jiggling Jello with the disruptive influence of its latest resident . " House . . . . " should be an enjoyable watch for more mature viewers , especially females , into foreign flicks and people watching . (

Enter the leading man , Bon Jovi , who offers to seduce the playwright's wife to distract her from her constant ruminations about her husbands affair . What happens after that is probably not what you would expect which is what makes this movie a pleasant surprise . Well cast , acted , written , directed , and shot , " The Leading Man " is an enjoyable little sleeper for mature tv audiences .
586878	783721	116833	6.0	For Irish lovers only	" The Last of the High Kings " aka " Summer Fling " is a wonderfully charming and wry little coming-of-age film with Leto at the center of a cast of idiosyncratic characters including his eccentric parents , some lovely lasses , and sundry town folk . This witty but dry slice of Irish life flick is laced with some not so obvious humor which will please those with sufficiently educated palates and leave others cold . A great watch for those with a taste for the Emerald Isles .

" Rules of Engagement " is A-Few-Good-Men-wannabee with some excellent acting and production talent which fails because of a weak and flawed story .

The film is all about this sort of " odd couple " , one Swede and one Norwegian ( circa 1950 ) , who manage to carve a friendship out of little more than proximity during a bleak Norwegian winter . A subtitled foreign light comedy with little to offer save its very wry underpinnings and pleasingly poignant tale , " Kitchen Stories " is a not-for-everyone film which with appeal most to those into quaint and off beat little foreign flicks .

The widow , however , is being courted by the town snake oil salesman who wants Selleck out of the way and hires a badass gunman . . . etc . The film is good old Hollywoodish big sky stuff with strings and french horns and cattle and branding and bronc busting and whooping and shootouts and even a kiss or two . Entertainment for the whole family with some killing from TNT . (
585708	783721	303933	7.0	Learning the rhythm system	" Drumline " tells of an Afro-Am high school grad and hotshot drummer who goes to college and learns it takes more than fast sticks to make the grade . Just okay as a light drama , this flick deserves high marks for making some positive points about the importance of rudiments and teamwork to success and for its tribute to , what is on most campuses considered un-cool , marching bands . What the film lacks in story it makes up for in marching band pageantry , music , and , most of all , percussion . A must see for anyone into marching bands and a should see for young people who dine on a steady diet of MTV and other entertainment junk food . ( B )
586590	783721	118756	7.0	En garde !	" On Guard " , a subtitled French film , is all about Auteuil as an 18th century swordsman , mercenary , and bon vivant who finds himself the victim of treachery and the lone custodian of an infant who is the sole heir to a noble rank and great fortune . His task is to honor an oath and restore his charge to her rightful place in the face of countless bad guys with blades and his adopted daughter's growing ardor as she comes of age . Packed with evil men and beautiful women and wonderful locations and lots of swishing and clinking steel , " On Guard " should be a fun watch for anyone into swashbuckling adventure flicks who can contend with 2 + hours of subtitles . ( B )
586848	783721	337960	7.0	Lotsa heart	" Danny Deckchair " tells of the adventures of a young concrete truck driver who decides to tie a bunch of helium filled balloons to his deck chair to soar aloft . His plan is to take shears with him to cut away one balloon at a time thereby making his descent . Instead , he leaves the shears behind and the balloons carry him to a new life and a new love . This sweet , cute , fun little flick from down-under is a fresh and creative new addition to the much over worked romcom genre . With lots of heart and unpredictable predictability , " Danny Deckchair " should be an enjoyable watch for those who don't mind a little schmaltz with their romantic comedy fare . ( B )
586737	783721	132477	7.0	A contrived Disneyesque feel-good flick .	" October Sky " has the feel of a purified and contrived Disney movie with the sole purpose of pushing the viewer's emotional buttons . Based on a true but thin story about a high school student who wants to be a rocket engineer and not a coal miner ( who wouldn't ? ) , this film is well shot , well acted , and full of implausibilities . For maximum enjoyment , disengage logic before viewing .
586529	783721	256103	7.0	The absence of love	" Intimacy " tells of a divorced man and a married woman who have weekly loveless sex while each knows little of the other . The film explores the " why " of their peculiar relationship and follows the pair of protags to their inevitable conclusion . Whatever you know , think , or read about this film , it does break new ground as it pushes legitimate cinema one small measure toward its destiny by illuminating that dark corner of human behavior currently occupied only by pornography . Be prepared for graphic sex / nudity and some intensely personal scenes in a stark , austere , somewhat depressing but very courageous drama . Not for prudes , " Intimacy " will be most enjoyed by mature drama enthusiasts . ( B )
587442	783721	186730	7.0	The real Kindergarten cop	" It All Starts Today " is an open ended slice-of-life tale which takes us into the world of a good-hearted , dedicated , and hard working French Kindergarten teacher who has a lot more on his plate than finger painting . Protag Daniel ( Torrenton ) not only teaches but runs interference for abused kids , wrestles with the local mayor for funding , contends with vandals , and juggles a host of economic , social , and school political issues all the while maintaining a relationship with his girl friend and her son . Though there isn't much of an arc to the story , this well crafted film does create a likeable character who shows us that the opportunity for heroism exists everywhere in life . . . even kindergarten . ( B )
586629	783721	213847	7.0	A worthwhile film but a nebulous presentation .	" Malena " is about many things . . . . the people of a small Sicilian town during WWII ; a woman scorned by the town's women and admired by the town's men for her sensual beauty ; and a pubescent boy's obsession with the woman as he comes of age . Obviously the product of a talented auteur because of its technical and artistic excellence and its many poignant moments , " Malena " fails to focus clearly on its story such that the end result is somewhat less than the sum of its parts . The director of " Cinema Paradiso " , Giuseppe Tornatore , doesn't deliver a cogent product in " Malena " though the film has its moments . Recommended for more mature males .
585762	783721	104685	7.0	What happens when you realize you don't like the people you love ?	" . . . Chez Nous " looks at this compelling question through the life of one Aussie woman who's self esteem is constantly undermined by the men in her life . This film is a psychodramatic , realistic , and intelligent look at the clockworks of a nuclear family held together more by mutual need than love and respect . The camera studies the slow disintegration of the family unit and the rebirth of Beth ( Harrow ) , the principle character . Well made , earnest , honest , and insightful . An interesting watch for more mature audiences .
585739	783721	218967	7.0	A good watch family men and women .	A sort of contempo redux of Dickens Christmas Carol , Cage plays a wealthy and very eligible bachelor on Wall Street who suddenly finds himself married with children . Yeah , this is another romantic comedy in a very tired genre . However , it is a cut above the average sap dripping chick flick as it doesn't wade in goo , has a crisp script , keeps moving , is genuinely funny , and tries hard not to be predictable . Fresh stuff with good chemistry between Cage and Leoni .
585818	783721	113774	7.0	A slowly endearing , plaintive , quirky slice-of-life tale .	" Margaret's Museum " tells of a young Nova Scotia woman who's bound by her family ties to a coal mining town where frequent accidents in the " pit " take their toll on the mine workers and their families . Not just another coal mining flick , " MM " focuses with musings , humor , and poignant moments on Margaret , who's nose is always running , and her assorted quirky family and friends . An engrossing , somewhat compelling , and almost charming little film , " MM " should appeal to those with a taste for slice-of-life flicks involving eccentric folk .
585712	783721	197384	7.0	A compelling dark psychodrama .	" C & P in Suburbia " is a dark and somewhat staged psychodrama with misanthropic overtones which focuses on the teen daughter of a family in crisis and her search for self-actualization . This well cast , well acted , well shot , well directed flick's story is likely to be too black or severe for many . However , those who feel inclined to write this film off as " unrealistic junk " should remember one word . Columbine .
587016	783721	120848	7.0	A good flick which tries to do too much .	" Such a Long Journey " is a well crafted film , a good shoot , and a showcase for some good performances . However , the story is such a jumble of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of Jack of all plots and master of none . Also , Western audiences will likely find the esoterics of the rather obscure Parsee culture a little much to get their arms around in 1 . 7 hours . Recommended for those with an interest in India .
586718	783721	218378	7.0	Brrrrr !	" The Claim " tells the tale of a ' 49er ( Mullen ) with the glitter of gold in his eyes who swaps his wife and baby for a claim in the rugged California Sierra-Nevada mountains . A beautifully filmed period piece which attempts to portray the difficulties and realities of the time with fidelity , " The Claim " offers excellence in all aspects of the film though it may be too austere , too Spartan to have broad appeal . A great film for realists into stories of the old West .
586157	783721	374546	7.0	Zensational	" Spring , Summer , Fall , Winter . . . and Spring " is a very East Asian art flick which moves like molasses with mesmerizing beauty as it spins its simple allegorical tale of the seasons of nature and life . The film centers on an elder Buddhist master and his young charge as the boy grows into manhood with considerably less grace than the passing of the old man to the next life . Mostly visual with minimal dialogue , this flick tells its tale with stunning cinematography , keeps subtitle reading to a minimum , and allows the disengaged and those who don't want to languish in many tedious moments to fast forward at x2 of x4 through most of the film reducing its100 minute run to 20-30 minutes . Recommended for buffs into Asian art flicks . ( B )

" Under the Sun " is a bucolic , warm , charming , and sentimental story about a 40 year old Swedish farmer who hires an attractive housekeeper who tends to somewhat more than cooking and cleaning . He's illiterate with an inheritance , she's smart and pretty , and he has a young male friend who may be after both his money and the woman . A lovely bit of romantic melodrama laced with humor and rustic beauty which could steal your heart or make you gag depending on your taste . Recommended for more mature sentimentalists . ( B )

" Iron Jawed Angels " is an HBO historical biopic / docudrama which turns the lens on Swank who delivers a sterling performance as Quaker , suffragist , and women's right activist Alice Paul during her campaign to secure the 19th Constitutional amendment . Director Katja von Garnier , who gave us the wonderfully hip girl-power cult flick " Bandits " , takes on the daunting task of delivering an entertaining film about a somewhat dry , esoteric subject and a relatively unknown character ( as history goes ) and succeeds . Sometimes whimsical , sometimes intense , spritzed with humor and drama , and packed with zingers and maxims , " Iron Jawed Angels " may be a chick flick but no man can deny nor should fail to appreciate the grace and beauty is delivers .

" Central Station " focuses on two very different people , a poorish middle-aged spinster and an orphaned boy , who come together because of circumstance and mutual need . The relationship and journey which ensues is the substance of this simple film . The story is told with harsh reality and an uncompromising honesty which serves to make the bad times bitter and the touching moments sweeter . An earnest effort which breaks all of Hollywood's rules of commercialism and will find it's market among cinema purists .
586943	783721	365190	8.0	The less you know the better	" Red Lights " , a subtitled French film , spends it's 1 . 75 hour run following Antoine ( Darroussin ) and his wife Hélène ( Bouquet ) as they leave Paris for a night drive to Bordeaux to pick up their kids . What should have been an ordinary road trip turns into an extraordinary series of events which will leave the couple forever changed . The less you know about these events prior to viewing the better as any hint of what happens could lead to a case of mistaken genre and spoilage . This film is a human drama which doesn't attempt to entertain with extremes but rather opts to engross with a slowly seductive tale of intrigues kept to realistic proportion . " Red Lights " relies heavily on the ability to identify with the adult married couple and the problems they encounter and , therefor , will play best with mature adult audiences . A nicely managed , methodical and very believable film which spends most of its time with Darroussin , " Red Lights " received good marks from critics and public alike and is well worth a look by mature viewers into French flicks .

A powerful performance by Weaver and excellent support by Moore and Strathairn help to make this sometimes tedious film well worth watching .
585640	783721	285861	8.0	All Hoffman	" Owning Mahoney " tells of a bank account manager and pathological gambler who lives from one wager to the next on a collision course with oblivion . A powerful and compelling tour de force by Hoffman - who once again proves he ranks among the actor's actors with the likes of Brando , Pacino , and Nicholson - this engrossing film claims to be a true story of a man , money , and an obsession of remarkable proportions . A worthwhile watch for Hoffman fans and anyone into character studies , particularly of obsessive-compulsive types . All others stay away . (

Beautifully filmed and character-driven with splendid directing and superb performances , there's little to fault in this film as two women cleave to one another under the pall of war , the terror of bombing , and the absence of men . The only liability " A & J " has is the subject may not whet the interest of many .

Centerpiece Hana ( Brodský ) shows us how to get babes to kiss you when your 78 and how to cop a feel in an elevator and get thanked for it as he pranks his way from day to day in this warm and glowing look at old age and one man's creative , amusing , but socially unacceptable ways of enjoying life while refusing to be relegated to the old folk's home . " Autumn Spring " is a plodding , subtle comedy with messages for all ages which will have the greatest appeal with more mature foreign film buffs . (
586046	783721	118111	8.0	A wonderfully satirical comedy .	" Waiting for Guffman " is a clever satirical comedy about a handful of citizen's in Blaine , Missouri , a fictitious town celebrating its sesquicentennial . The film uses the mockumentary approach to show a motley bunch of wannabee performers as they create a musical stage play depicting the town's history . Actor / Writer / Director Christopher Guest is the centerpiece of the film playing a gay performer with some real off-off-off-off-Broadway experience who produces the town's musical . A great watch for anyone who loves satire or that off-the-wall , tongue-in-cheek Second City brand of humor .

Unable to sleep under the midnight sun , he begins to unravel as he digs deeper into the crime and becomes a reluctant partner to his quarry . A slick shoot with excellent acting and good auteursmanship by " Memento " director Nolan , " Insomnia 2002 " is not without its plotholes . An over-hyped drama and not a murder mystery , this flick has little action , no sex / nudity , few moments of thrills and / or suspense , and characters who are not likely to engender empathy . Solid dramatic entertainment worth a look nonetheless . (

587415	783721	249462	8.0	Brit flick goes Hollywood and wins kudos .	The much lauded and nominated film " Billy Elliott " is a slice of life flick about an 11 year old English boy who , to the dismay of his motherless working class coal mining family , chooses ballet over boxing as a pastime . The film is technically excellent , artistically well done , and follows the traditions of Hollywood film-making . The story is a pleasant mix of humor and pathos , not too deep , and palatable enough to make it an audience favorite . In addition to being just plain fun to watch , " BE " makes a few points about accepting people for who they are ; about the undeniability of innate passion by artists ; and about the sublimation of aggression through dance . Not a classic and somewhat over rated , the simple numbers prove " BE " is a box office favorite and an enjoyable watch for most . Kudos to the choreographer and Bell for some fun to watch and never seen before kookie , kid-like mixes of jazz , tap , ballet , and jigs .

" Prime Suspect 4 " continues the exploits of the inscrutable and dogged seeker of truth and justice , Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison ; the first of three miniseries ( PS4 , PS5 , & PS6 ) with the notable absence of founding writer Lynda La Plante from the credits . Imbued with the same gritty reality of the first three series , the second three series pit Tennison against the forces of evil while coping with middle age , loneliness , indiscretions , a host of personal and professional problems , and resolutions which are sometimes less than ideal . PS4 conjures two stories while PS5 & PS6 are single episodes each which find Tennison seeking justice on behalf of the brutally wronged while waging war against institutions which are willing to sacrifice the interests of her victims for those of a greater good . In other words , to prevail , Tennison must overcome both evil and good forces , something which makes the always gray scenarios of the PS series yet grayer and the Tennison wars as much a matter of principle as of finding murderers . Very good stuff which only gets better from series to series . (
586394	783721	319769	8.0	Masterfully masculine	" Mondays in the Sun " speaks boldly , loudly , and honestly albeit narrowly about the plaintive existence of a group jobless Spanish shipyard workers . What this study of working class men lacks in depth of story it makes up for in depth of character as it moves methodically through bitter , sweet , poignant , and humorous moments with sincerity , honesty , and drenched in masculinity . With high marks from public and critical corners alike , " Mondays in the Sun " will be time well spent for most . (
586072	783721	258273	8.0	Fresh , fun , and female .	" Lovely & Amazing " is a slice-of-life dialogue-intensive comedy / drama-lite examination of a mother and her two adult daughters stumbling through life one day at a time . Holofcener paints an insightful portrait of the three women with delicate brushstrokes , sufficiently colorful to be interesting and sufficiently real to engender empathy , as the they face their daily vicissitudes with a the usual mix of insecurity , courage , self-doubt , and certainty . A critically lauded , delightful , easy to watch , and entertaining little chick flick for today's woman . (
586278	783721	246772	8.0	Mostly Martha but all good .	" Mostly Martha " is a thoroughly delightful tale of a comely , self contained , socially unassured , and occasionally gauche German master chef , Martha ( Gedeck ) , in need of a recipe for living who finds love through tragedy and romance through cooking . In thinking about these comments I concluded that there is nothing I would change about this film except the language ( I don't speak German ) . A perfect little gem , " Mostly Martha " is the kind of flick which makes you feel sorry for those who won't watch foreign films because of subtitles and wonder why audiences dine voraciously on cinematic junk food when such palate pleasers as this are not only delicious but nutritious .

586523	783721	285742	9.0	A very human tale of redemption	" Monster's Ball " tells of a white man and a black woman in the rural South coming together through desperate human need ; each suffering grief , guilt , remorse , and misery . A slow , plodding drama with rumbling racial undercurrents , the film tells a simple story , though not uneventful , with finely nuanced performances , especially by Berry who earned her keep and kudos . Recommended for mature audiences into serious drama .
586678	783721	243931	9.0	Good advice ? Watch it .	" Good Advice " tells of a down and out ex-stock broker ( Sheen ) who takes over his girl friend's advice column leading to love , success , and much fun . With a zinger every few seconds , funny characters and situations , a clever story with a feel good conclusion , " Good Advice " makes for a fresh and fun watch . In the absence of hype and considering the talent behind the film , " GA " qualifies as a " sleeper " and should be a pleasant surprise for most who manage to snag it on cable .
586363	783721	316188	9.0	Exquisitely human	For what it is , " Raising Victor Vargas " is about as close to perfection as a film can get . Either sheer genius from a fledgling auteur or just one of those lucky mixes where everything clicked ( probably some of each ) , this simple little slice-of-urban-life ethnic first love flick fleshes out its young characters with such depth you can almost read their minds . The film begins with a strong flavor of " street " but works its way into a Latino family affair and then focuses on a story which speaks volumes about the uncertainty of youth and the profoundly natural desire to love another . In my experience , never has so much been done with so little ( cast of tyros , novice director , etc . ) . Praised by the critics but not for everyone , " Raising Victor Vargas " is recommended for indie lovers and realists into simple tales rich in humanness . ( A )
586375	783721	105977	10.0	The fat man rides again	" Cracker " is all about a behemoth but successful criminal psychologist , Dr . Edward Fitzgerald ( Coltrane ) , who armed only with his wits , Holmesian powers of deduction , superior intellect , knowledge of human behavior , etc . solves police-stumping murder mysteries . However , the biggest mystery for the drinking , smoking , over-eating fat " Fitz " seems to be how to quit gambling so he can pay bus fare and get his wife back . Save the idiosyncratically irascible and charming cop shrink character ( reminiscent of the 1940's radio detective program " The Fat Man " ) there's little new in this TV series out of the UK which spends 60 % of the time solving mysteries and 40 % exploring the ups and downs of Fitz's personal life . Worth a look for those into British TV caper busters . ( B )
