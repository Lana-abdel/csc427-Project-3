405911	2020269	481610	1.0	Irredeemably awful	This movie is so bad I don't even want to joke about it . The only Raison d'être of this review is warn people to stay far away from " Silent Scream " . For a friend of mine it's already too late , as he blind-bought this rubbish on DVD , but you can still be saved if you just manage resist the promising-looking cover image and the pictures of ravishing girls on the back of the box . " Silent Scream " is as bad as low-budget teen horror gets , with a plot that gets more retarded with each minute that passes , the dumbest characters in history ( even though they're supposed to be psychology students ) and dialogs so painful they make your ears cringe . One could state that the body count is remarkably higher than usually the case in slasher films , but even then , the murder sequences are totally uninspired and the complete lack of continuity and / or a plausible plot is simply intolerable . In order to thank the entire class for helping with his dreams-manipulation research , a weak-acting psychology professor rewards them with the keys of his vacation resort on a snowy Michigan island . The first part of the group arrives and have some mindless sex and too much tequila before getting slaughtered the exact same night by an individual wearing a hooded winter jacket . The second group arrives the day after and teams up with the last two survivors of group one . Unfortunately they offer a little more resistance to the killer and even come close to escaping the island . Then comes the hopelessly predictable and imbecile twist-in-the-end . The script is just a non-stop series of stupidities , dire clichés and insufferable stereotypes . The empty-headed characters say the dumbest things at the most inappropriate moments and , as if that wasn't bad enough already , they constantly repeat themselves as well . Especially the male lead Mark is a pitiable character , as he keeps nagging to his ex-girlfriend that he still loves her even though they're being chased by a maniac holding an axe . All the girls are great eye-candy ( except for Melissa Schuman who tries to act too much like Sarah Michelle Gellar ) and some of them even show their ravishing flesh , but they're just too stupid and obnoxious to be likable characters . " Silent Scream " is boring , irritating as hell , ugly to look at , poorly directed and completely unoriginal . Next time you pick it up in a shop or videostore , just put it back .
405538	2020269	83185	1.0	Makes you want to rip out your eyeballs and EAT THEM !	Ah , the wondrous mysteries of late 70's / early 80's Euro-exploitation cinema ? With almost a 100 % positive certainty , the script of this film was improvised along whilst shooting . Judging by the tone and cheerful atmosphere of the opening sequences , it doesn't even look like the creators ( Alain Deruelle and Julio Tabernero ) ever intended to make a movie about cannibals , but maybe the producers forced them in order to quickly cash in on the gigantic success of contemporary horror-hits like " Cannibal Holocaust " and " Cannibal Ferox " . As you probably know , everything was possible in the exploitation industry , even hiring the notorious smut filmmaker Jess Franco to shoot some additional footage . The film opens with a rhythmic and jolly carnival song , introduces several comical characters and a potentially interesting ( but poorly elaborated ) kidnapping / ransom plot . The cannibal tribe and obligatory grossness only kicks in after about 40 minutes and comes across as totally ridiculous . Three amateur thugs , one voluptuous woman and two guys , randomly decide to abduct the daughter of a wealthy businessman and demand a ransom . When one of their accomplices gets involved in a banal car accident , they flee towards the jungle ( I think the South American ) and seek shelter in the hut of a friend . Nearby there's a tribe of primitive cannibals , but they appear to remain politely within their perimeters . Only when one of the thugs rapes the lady of the house , her husband almost literally feeds them to the cannibals . Meanwhile , the parents of the kidnapped girl have also arrived in the jungle ( don't ask me how , though ) , but they're good people and hence don't get eaten . Needless to say " Cannibal Terror " is an incredibly bad film and I honestly can't name one good element , apart maybe from the jolly theme song . Sure , there's a bit of nasty gore , but there's absolutely no prior tension building and the actual munching goes on for far too long . You know you're in trouble when even the gory bits in a movie are dull . The acting performances are atrocious . The lines of the little girl are practically inaudible and I'm pretty sure an adult woman imitating the voice of a child spoke them . The " jungle " setting is quite hilarious , as the film is clearly shot in someone's home garden and the " natives " are plain white day-players . Several of them even have sideburns and sophisticated haircuts . Oh dear ?
404904	2020269	83033	1.0	Is this supposed to be funny ? Or scary ? . . . Or anything at all ?	Oh yeah . . . we have a winner ! This has got to be most retarded movie I've ever seen ! I don't care whether it was meant to be accessible for younger viewers or not , this " spoof " stands for everything that gives the horror genre a bad name ! Amateurish and terribly lame rubbish that doesn't even seem to know what it's poking fun at . Judging by the title , you'd think that the screenplay mercilessly attacks the box-office hit " Friday the 13th " and all its brainless clones , but it's not even mentioning a masked killer . Instead , we have a family of unintelligent souls inheriting a house stuffed with monsters . When Junior opens a book he shouldn't have , the countdown for the end of the world has begun . The only kind of " special effects " are a bunch of idiots who volunteered to dress up like silly monsters in cheap-looking costumes . I counted one remotely funny gag ( " damn owls . . . " ) and all the other jokes and witty lines were embarrassingly dire . I truly hope that cast and crew were really proud to be a part of this turkey . Avoid at all costs .
405374	2020269	265105	1.0	It's okay to be gay . It's not okay to make crap movies	Wow , this movie is even gayer than " HellBent " ! What are the odds of that ever happening ? I don't think David DeCoteau ever had the intention of making a horror movie ? He clearly just wanted to surround himself with athletic & handsome twenty-something boys , so he quickly thought up a scenario about a college fraternity of vampires . Instead of action & suspense , we get an whole army of male students parading in their matching tight white boxer shorts and instead of gory massacres we get insecure boys openly talking about their feelings and emotions ? for hours ! Two young losers meet each other on the first day of college . Chris has the body of a regular jock , but he's the sensitive type , so he doesn't want people to judge him based on his appearance . The other one , Dan , never stops nagging about how unpopular he was in his previous school . They befriend a girl with an incredibly beautiful rack ; still all they ever talk about is their mutual friendship . In come the boys of the Domo Tau Omega fraternity ; pretentious little pricks with sunglasses that rule over the university . Their leader ? super gay dude Devon ? wants Chris to join his elite group because he fancies him . Poor Chris doesn't know , however , that they form the gayest coven of vampires horror cinema has ever brought forward . " The Brotherhood " is a terrible film . There's not even an attempt to build up tension or atmosphere and DeCoteau didn't even bother to insert some cheesy horror effects . The vampires suck , all right . But not blood ? They suck at making themselves appear menacing and evil . The dialogs are abysmal and the production values are overall poor , barely disguising the fact that our director is more interested in shooting porn movies . Or maybe put together catalogs for men's underwear . He should do so , and quit misleading fans of horror films . The cast members may be yummy eye-candy ( at least , for certain target groups ) , but none of them has the slightest bit of acting talent . One to avoid at all costs .
406287	2020269	83291	1.0	Exploitation-Extravaganza !	" Mad Foxes " is what happens if someone grants a bunch of drunken loonies access to a camera and simultaneously offers them $20 to make their very own movie . This whole thing probably started as a bad joke among friends in a sinister bar and after having too much to drink already ? They all wanted to make a movie , none of them had any talent or even any clue how to begin filming and since they couldn't decide what to focus on , they simply processed every imaginable exploitation theme into the film . Oh yes , you name it and " Mad Foxes " has got it ! There's Nazi bikers , foggoty race cars , kick-boxing , castration , the rape of virgins , disembowelment , sailors dancing , scenes from a guy in the crapper , public sex , an Oedipus complex , an S & M Dominatrix , hideously inappropriate metal music by a band named " Krokus " , skinny-dipping , sluts with big breasts , sluts with small breasts , grenades , males that wear girlish panties over their own pants , randomly crashing cars , exploding bikes , suicide bombing , wheelchair catapulting , exaggerated fake laughter , demented dialogs , stabbing , death by hedge clippers , bathtub sex , no coppers , massive loads of pubic hair and the inevitable greatest dubbing job in the history of cinema ! Every new sequence in " Mad Foxes " is literally a new & adventurous journey into a universe of grotesqueness and disbelief . At several times whilst watching this piece of exploitation-extravaganza , you're guaranteed to rub your eyes and wonder : " Is this real ? " Am I really watching this ? Did somebody actually make this film ? ? " . Not a drug in this world can offer you such a dangerously intoxicating and flamboyant trip as Paul Grau's " Mad Foxes " . Now that I've seen this gloriously retarded highlight of euro-trash cinema , I can die a happy man !
406266	2020269	395443	1.0	Dull , derivative , dud . . . Like you ought to know beforehand .	Okay , admittedly I wasn't paying too much attention and there probably is a perfectly logical explanation , but there's something about " Alien Lockdown " that I absolutely don't understand . During the opening sequences there's a dull narration about a meteor crashing on earth millions of years ago and bringing forward an emerald-type of talisman that makes whoever owns it invincible ? or something . Then , all of a sudden , we're back in present time ( or even in the future ? ) and the story revolves on mad scientist building the ultimate soldier in a secret laboratory in the Rocky Mountains . What's the connection with the ancient emerald ? Where does the alien tissue come from ? Most important question of all : who the hell cares ? Naturally , the project goes wrong and a military expedition is sent in to exterminate the monster . Yawn ! " Alien Lockdown " is a frustratingly terrible type of horror / Sci-Fi movie . You honestly wonder why they continue to produce movies like this , as the formula has nothing interesting or original to offer anymore . It's just the umpteenth uninspired and dreadful clone of " Alien " and there's really nothing positive to write about . The characters are walking , talking stereotypes , the scenery and locations look second-hand and the atmosphere is non-existent . And the action sequences , well ? You know what they are like : soldiers endlessly wandering around dark corridors with flashlights , then suddenly there's the flashing image of a hideous monster and the next moment the flashlight lies abandoned on the floor . John Savage terribly overacts as the mad scientist , as if he's protesting against all the worthless crap he's starring in lately . Your glorious days of " The Deer Hunter " and " The Onion Field " are long gone , John ? Michelle Goh acts pretentious and wannabe tough , like she's the first female action heroine ever . She probably doesn't realize they only chose her because Lucy Liu is too expensive . Bah , enough time and words wasted on this dud of a film . Just stay away from it !
405091	2020269	105179	2.0	Beware : Priest at large ! ! !	What's the most frustrating thing that can happen to you in the videostore ? Imagine : you find a box that says ' Prom Night ' with a nice , gruesome cover . You seem to remember that , talking in terms of 80's slashers , this Prom Night is supposed to be a masterpiece . Without hesitating much , you take it and go home . Then you play it and as the credits start to appear on the TV-screen it turns out you've rented something that's actually ' Prom Night 4 : Deliver us from Evil ' . They made a Prom Night 4 now ? ? I've been had ! ! Anyway , since complaining in the videostore is of no use , you just watch this piece of junk . Two young couples , staying in mum and dad's mansion for the weekend , are terrorized by a priest whose thoughts and actions are controlled by the devil . This priest ? father Jones ? killed before , but the Church managed to keep it secret and hidden for 34 years . All this time , Father Jones was locked up in a cellar and tranquillized with drugs . A young , inexperienced priest lets him escape . There's no tension , no background ( how did Father Jones got possessed ? ) and no original deaths . The acting is awful ( or what did you think ? ) and the gore-level is extremely low . Welcome to redundant and stupid sequel n° 5 . 789 ! Oh , one more thing ? it may be a detail but ? where was the Prom ? ?
406282	2020269	82910	2.0	Garbage with wings	A piranha ( which is basically a FISH-species and therefore requires water ! ) crawls out of a corpse's chest that has been lying in the morgue for an entire day ? grabs a new victim by the throat ? devours her entirely ? and then cheerfully flies through the window , back to the sea . Hmmm , it's imaginative ; I'll give it that . But it is even more ridiculous and stupid . Piranha II actually is an exact copy of the original , but without the slick satire and wit characters . James Cameron ( Yes ! The James Cameron of the Terminator films and Titanic ) retells the story of ignorant resort-owners who refuse to give up their profits when tourists on a sunny island start to die . The piranhas are a military experiment gone wrong ( figures ? ) and the characters are downright embarrassing . The make-up effects are cheap and nasty , but not highly efficient . Lance Henriksen wasted his talent on yet another meaningless numb nuts horror movie .
406401	2020269	120841	2.0	Invade , Mate & Alienate !	Hard to believe that Peter Medak , a talented filmmaker who made stylish films such as " The Changeling " and " The Krays " , signed to direct an overly gore and dumb sequel to the already very mediocre " Species " . At least the original 1995 film featured some impressive visual effects and playful nudity , whereas this sequel only has mean-spirited gore and gratuitous sex scenes . Remotely interesting is that the screenplay isn't just an identical re-telling of the original , but a fairly new Sci-Fi story . . . . albeit a very BAD one . Once again , the scripting team behind " Species " associates alien life forms with insatiable sexual hunger , only this time the outer space monster is a male and thus even more determined to copulate all humanity to death . The first successful Mars expedition returns to earth but something awry happened to the three astronauts during the seven minute radio-intermission . The same extraterrestrial monster that provided yummy Sil with her alien DNA entered the bodies of the astronauts . One of them is immune , the second is destroyed fast but the final alien-carrier ; the handsome and very popular Senator son Patrick Ross , quickly becomes an unstoppable killing machine . Beautiful Natasha Henstridge plays the clone of her own original character , who's telepathically linked to the new alien / human hybrid . Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger both return , but their characters ' personalities seem to have changed drastically . The respond to certain situations different than before and the script doesn't even bother to enlighten us why they failed as a couple . These are still acceptable shortcomings . . . Much worse is the total lack of tension , the provocative dialogues and the exploitative portrayal of women . This movie will probably be enjoyed the most by younger and inexperienced horror & Sci-Fi fans that disregard a good , plausible plot on their search for graphic gore . We're really served a lot of that : exploding heads , spontaneous alien-births , exaggeratedly long tentacles and torn open torsos . Yuck .
406296	2020269	455857	2.0	" What's your favorite scary movie ? " Definitely not this one !	I usually make it a personal rule never to watch a remake before having seen the original version but , in my defense , I needed a free fourth title after already renting three movies and this was the only one that was still available . And now I definitely have to find and watch the original 1979-version , if only to see for myself that it can't possibly be as BORING and insignificant as Simon West's remake ! What a dull , redundant & lame film , this is ! We all know not to expect too much from a PG13-rated " thriller " , but this is absolutely ridiculous ! There's no action , no identifiable or amiable characters , the supposedly unsettling phone conversations are endlessly stretched just to increase the running time a bit and the whole psychopathic murderer denouement is totally implausible and retarded . The first five minutes , just for as long as the opening credits run over the screen , are undeniably the best and only atmospheric moments in the entire film . Whilst witnessing images of a small town carnival , we overhear someone with a deep masculine voice harassing a young woman over the telephone . Moments later , her lifeless body is dragged out of the house and an elderly frustrated police officer looks into the distance . Naturally you expect him to fanatically hunt down the killer , but hell no ! He doesn't even reappear again . Instead , the story swifts to an entirely different town-setting and the first hour exclusively revolves on typically irritating high-school characters and soporific romance sub plots . Cute , easy-on-the-eyes Jill Johnson is punished by her father for spending too much time on the phone with her cheating boyfriend , and so she has to baby-sit instead of attending her friends ' party . The house is gigantic and luxurious , but poor little Jill then receives alarming phone calls from someone who appears to observe every move she makes inside the house . There's very little to say about " When a Stranger Calls " , actually . The plot is painfully predictable and unsurprising ; the slow-moving attempts to build up tension are continuously interrupted with false scares ( the house cat popping up every now and then , for example ) and there's a total shortage of carnage and excitement . The rudimentary script is still full of holes and illogicalness ( the girl's father can hardly find the address of the isolated villa but her bimbo friend can ? ) and Simon West doesn't even grab the opportunity to make the phone conversations obscene or creepy . At least the notorious opening sequence in Wes Craven's " Scream " , featuring Drew Barrymore , offered some neat dialogs . Camilla Belle is a pretty girl but nearly not talented enough to build up a further career as talented scream-queen and none of the supportive cast members are even worth mentioning . " When a Stranger Calls " perfectly embodies why remakes are gradually ruining the great genre of horror . Avoid at all costs .
405083	2020269	130487	3.0	Oh no ! ! Not Kentucky mountain hillbillies again !	It's a shame that this lovely site doesn't feature a poster image of this ' Geek ' , a . k . a Backwoods . The VHS copy I rented showed a mad-raving freak , waving around a butcher's hatchet . It attracts horror lovers and , in all honesty , I have to admit that the cover motivated me to rent it without knowing anything about it . Big mistake , of course ! Backwoods stands as one of the lousiest pieces of trash I ever beheld ? and that does mean something ! This film is a bloodless 80's slasher and that's about the worst idea possible . The makers clearly intended to bring tension and dept instead of blood and gore but they failed miserably . After an hour of viewing , you still haven't seen any of the cast-members dying ( unless you think decapitated chickens are gruesome ) . What other reasons do you have for seeing a slasher besides teen-butchering ? ? ? The heart-breaking story about a lone Kentucky farmer and his deranged son ? The thrilling adventures of a young couple camping ? The only aspect worth mentioning is the eerie opening / end credits song . The slowly sung and chilling lyrics give you the wrong impression that you're about to watch a good film . Check out ' Deliverance ' , ' The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ' , ' Just before Dawn ' , ' The Hills have Eyes ' or even Rick Roessler's ' Slaughterhouse ' instead ! Anything but this turkey !
404467	2020269	78749	3.0	Going deeper underground . . .	This massively incoherent , dumb , cheesy and amateurish Italian early-eighties " movie-thing " rewards itself with the title " Alien 2 " but there's very little , even no relation with Ridley Scott's Sci-Fi masterpiece that single-handedly altered the status of the genre . This is written and directed by Ciro Ippolito . Who , you say ? That's right , even in the gigantic world of Italian rip-off cinema he's an absolute nobody , and then still " Alien 2 " appears to be his best work . Poor guy ? Anyway , this definitely isn't the most blatant & shameless Alien imitation we've ever seen , as Ippolito actually just stole the claustrophobic setting aspect as well as the idea that the extraterrestrial perpetrator initially requires a host-body to grow in size and appetite . The story opens with reports from a spacecraft having encountered severe ' problems ' on their way back to earth . Next thing we know the ship crash-landed in the sea and the nearby area lies strew with intergalactic blue stones . Meanwhile , an 8-headed group of young amateur-speleologists descends a cave with one of them blue stones in their backpacks . Naturally , it isn't just a stone but an alien's egg , and when the critter emerges from it , it goes straight for attacking the face . Oh , and did I mention there's a cautious attempt to a sub plot about one of the lead girls being telepathically gifted and trying to communicate with the alien ? Okay , the cave-setting admittedly was a nifty idea and it's much more original than other Alien wannabes like , say , " Inseminoid " and " Forbidden World " . But the script is so damn stupid and the first 40-45 minutes are dreadfully boring . The gore is good and rather repulsive to behold , but there nearly isn't enough of it ! The schlock-highlights include someone's head slowly getting separated from the rest of his body and , a couple of minutes later , another guy's head gets blown to pieces . That's pretty much it , apart from a few cheesy images of human faces reduced to messy bits of pulp . The ending is fairly atmospheric and tense , even though it doesn't make the slightest bit of sense like so many other parts of the film . Don't expect to receive any explications , neither , because you just get cool-sounding warnings at the end , like " You May Be Next ! " . Next for what ? To have my face chewed off by a blue stone ? The Angelis Brothers ' music is surprisingly good & catchy , albeit quite overused , and there's a nice bit of totally gratuitous nudity as well . " Alien 2 " is a truly bad film , but there still are far worse ways to kill 80 minutes of your precious time .
404674	2020269	286306	3.0	Dreadful watch	It seems to be rather popular recently to mix horror elements with the real-life misery of war . Sometimes that works out real well , like in " Below " ( and even " Dog Soldiers " up till a certain level ) but in this case , it ended up being a failure and a missed opportunity . Nine British soldiers are stuck in an abandoned German position during WWI and something evil is getting the upper hand on them . Is there really something evil dwelling around the camp or are these men just going insane due to the cruel and depressing war ? ? ? This riddle is mysteriously kept hidden during almost the entire movie but it lacks suspense and excitement to really care about it . And when the clue is finally becoming more clear , it's an even bigger letdown . Far-fetched and extremely illogical nonsense . And if that isn't worse enough . . . the movie suffers from all the annoying war-clichés . All stereotype soldiers are present . . . The sensitive rookie , the boisterous warrior who doesn't care whether he lives or dies and - of course - the poor prisoner who begs for his life . Fans of realistic war epics won't like it because the script is poorly put together and horror fans will be disappointed because the horror elements aren't used to the max . In fact , the only good comments I can give to this film go out to the use of locations . I'll give them that , the images of the horrible trenches and the spooky camp are well shot . Even the constant rain and dark weather fits the movie well . . . but it's hardly worth to run out immediately and buy ( or even rent ) a copy . Deathwatch . . . not recommended !
405187	2020269	74729	3.0	Mein ( boring ) Kampf	Never thought that I , as a native Dutch speaker , would encounter irremovable Dutch subtitles on a Region 1 movie that came imported from the USA ! This movie is available in the newly released " Grindhouse Experience " box-set , but since it never officially came out on DVD , the version is clearly ripped from an ancient VHS copy . And that copy must have originally come from either The Netherlands or Belgium , which makes sense , as the lowest shelves of video stores around here are literally packed with this sort of rancid exploitation trash ! I've seen loads of " Naziploitation " efforts and they're all pretty terrible , but in the hands of the infamous Bruno Mattei ( appropriately nicknamed the Ed Wood of Italian cinema ) you get something that is even worse than terrible , namely something downright unendurable ! " Naziploitation " was the most pointless trend of 70's smut-cinema and to this day I still fail to comprehend why it was so damn popular in those days . All these movies practically have the same senseless plot , and so does " Women's Camp 119 " . Beautiful and defenseless young girls are shipped off to vile concentration camps where they get abused & humiliated by sleazy wardens and where they serve as reluctant guinea pigs for idiotic scientists of the Third Reich . In this piece of garbage , for example , the girls are forced to thaw frozen Nazi officers using simply their body heat and " cure " men from their wicked disease called homosexuality . One poor woman even has her uterus removed because the Nazi's decided she should share her fertility with other , less fertile women . Of course there's a lot of full-frontal nudity and sex on display , but it's never once arousing or even agreeable to watch . This clearly was an extremely low-budgeted production and I don't even think Bruno Mattei's cinematographers could afford to buy a couple of light bulbs . Too often you find yourself staring at an almost entirely black screen and even the exterior sequences suffer from bad lighting . There are numerous ( and redundant ) scenes in which people glorify the ideals of Hitler and his book " Mein Kampf " , and I suppose this was done simply to increase the shock-value . The acting performances are atrocious , with the exception of Lorraine De Selle who's adequate as the doctor's assistant . In the 1980's , De Selle would also star in Bruno Mattei's absolute best movie called " Woman's Prison Massacre " ; this time as a warden .
405811	2020269	343449	3.0	Mr . Sandman ? Throw me a BONE !	" The Bone Snatcher " starts out extremely promising , with the introduction of a new and original type of unseen evil as well as with the use of the sublimely isolated filming location of the African desert . Whilst checking pipelines out in the desert , three miners are attacked and killed by a seemingly unworldly creature that devours their flesh and only leaves a pile of half-eaten bones . The expedition crew sent to rescue them discovers that the monster is a superiorly mutated ant-queen , and pretty soon they find themselves trapped in the uncanny desert as well . Director Jason Wulfsohn sustains a respectable level of tension just until the nature of the monster is identified . Immediately after that , the film rapidly turns into an ordinary creature-feature with all the characters dropping out of the survival-race one by one . The second half of " The Bone Snatcher " is unendurably boring ; with the inevitable love-story clichés as well as a complete absence of gory murder set pieces . The characters all are insufferable stereotypes that act and say exactly what you predict several minutes in advance . There's the rookie who has to prove himself , the female with brain-capacity apart from her hot looks , the obnoxious experienced guy who redeems himself at the end through self-sacrifice and ? last but not least ? who could forget the wise black guy who refers to the monster using all kind of voodoo names . Wulfsohn tries too hard to make his monster look like the outer space menaces of " Alien " and " Predator " . The ant-creature has infrared-vision and crumbles when shot at , yawn ! The movie actually just benefits from its unique setting and the handful of nasty images of decomposed bodies . This could have been a modest gem , but instead it's less than mediocre . Avoid .
404971	2020269	492486	3.0	Where's the complementary sample ?	" Shrooms " ? like the title obviously implies ? is a prototypic slasher movie that takes place in Ireland whilst the main characters are experiencing outrageous drug-trips brought on by mushrooms . Well , the distributors should have offered free samples of these psychedelic mushrooms to anyone courageous enough to rent / buy this movie , because the only way to even remotely enjoy " Shrooms " is when you're high on dope ! Admittedly the script has a few positive aspects going for it ( they're merely just details , though ) but the wholesome is just another uncreative , gore-free and disgustingly pretentious slasher picture . Five Americans meet up with their Irish college buddy in his home country and their sole mission is to get wasted on the legendary local mushroom tea . After a night of scary tales around the campfire , they find themselves terrorized by killers that may be hallucinatory or , in fact , genuine relics of a nearby institution with a gruesome history . One of the group's members suffers from eerie premonitions of the murders because she ate a poisonous mushroom , and she desperately attempts her friends to get out of the area . The film's primary purpose is to mislead the audience by constantly suggesting the horrific events may not even be real but just hallucinations brought on by the characters ' bad trips . This intent miserably fails because there simply isn't an atmosphere of suspense present and you don't care about what happens to these dim-witted characters , anyway . Even worse is that practically all the bloodshed occurs off-screen . We only see a compilation of roughly edited and flashy images before the camera zooms out and shows the blond chick's panicky face . Lame ! The ending is pretty much identical to at least two other recently released ( and far better ) horror flicks , so if you've seen your share of genre movies , you'll quickly figure out the denouement and won't be the least bit impressed . Of course I can't reveal the titles of those movies otherwise the ending would be clear to everyone . Oh yes , I did mention something about positive aspects . Well , in all honesty there are some ! There's the urban legend about the institution that is quite creepy , a sadly unprocessed sub plot about two inbred poachers living in the woods and a rather fantastic moment involving a scene with talking cow . Also , the friendships between the lead characters are different than in most slashers . These people constantly bicker , insult , betray and cheat on each other . Interesting and funny little trivia detail , but of course hardly enough to make it worthwhile movie .
405141	2020269	82914	3.0	Woof . . . I mean , Woeful !	Yvonne De Carlo ( everyone's favorite Munster ) gives away quite a scary and praiseworthy performance as Hester Ramsey , a rancorous and slightly deranged elderly lady who lives alone in a large mansion with her harshly trained Rottweiler Greta . She holds a slight grudge against her family because she's convinced that her sister stole the one true love of her life and now she developed the fiendish plan to use Greta's killing capacities to get revenge . It's a fairly interesting and original concept for an 80's creature feature , but the film lacks tension and there's too little gore and bloodshed . Greta is an astonishingly trained dog , but her skills are still underused and the script at one point even reveals that black magic is responsible for her turning into a merciless killing machine . Why the hell was that necessary ? Who needs voodoo to explain the aggression of a Rottweiler ? There's nothing as pathetic as wanting to make a horror movie about a dangerous killer dog and then cowardly blame his action and behavior on the black magic powers of his owner . Greta also has voyeuristic tendencies , because she observes a young couple having ( overlong ) sex not once but twice . Instead of doing that , or instead of electrocuting people in their bathtubs , she ought to rip out throats , dammit ! The character of the police inspector provides some comical relief , with his witty remarks and arrogant behavior towards his younger colleagues , but it's just a small positive detail in an overall extremely dull and forgettable movie . Good horrors revolving on murderous dogs are quite a rarity . Top of my head I can only think of " The Pack " and " White Dog " . " Play Dead " belongs in the mediocre-to-awful section , alongside " Rottweiler " , " Devil Dog " , " Dogs of Hell " and " Monster Dog " .
405277	2020269	67382	3.0	Je Ne Comprends Pas . . .	The one-line summary of this review is French , translates itself as " I don't understand " and actually refers to several aspects of this film ? I read several articles where acclaimed critics and fellow directors reward Réné Clément with the title of " the French Hitchcock " . I sincerely hope they didn't base this recognition on seeing " The Deadly Trap " and , if so , I don't understand . I also don't understand half of what's going on this movie and I most certainly don't understand ( or better yet : refuse to accept ) how anyone dares to deliver such a completely incoherent and deceptively pretentious mess of a film ! " The Deadly Trap " revolves on ? believe it or not ? absolutely NOTHING ! At least until very late into the second half of the film , it doesn't . Faye Dunaway and Frank Langella star as a married couple living in Paris with their two children . He behaves increasingly suspicious and secretive regarding his employment ( and I do mean secretive , as we never get told what exactly he does for a living ) and she portrays the good housewife slowly but surely descending in a downwards spiral of paranoia and insanity . Jill continuously fears that the children will become the target of malignant individuals , but Philippe hardly ever listens to a word she's saying . Then , of course , the children do get kidnapped by an organization that wants ' something ' from Philippe in exchange for the children's lives . Even during this crucial point in the movie , we still haven't got a clue what it is they want ( except for ' information ' ) and the supposedly worldwide and dangerous organization imprisons the children in a nearby house with only one female babysitter to guard them . That's just totally retarded . Réné Clément's direction is flat and uninspired and he doesn't even make full use of the wondrously picturesque Parisian filming locations . The original French title means " The House under the Trees " and refers to the organization's hideout , but the beautiful house only features in the film for approximately 2 , 5 minutes . Faye Dunaway , at the top of her ravishing beauty around that time , is the only positive note I can bring myself to write about this unimaginably disappointing movie . She's quite convincing in her role , even though she probably didn't know what it was about , neither .
404779	2020269	257106	3.0	A very poor and lackluster effort .	The unexpected success of " Scary Movie " demanded an immediate sequel and all the Wayans ' brothers could come up with was this uninspired , irritating story that ( attempts to ) spoof Haunted House horror films such as the " House on Haunted Hill " , " Poltergeist " and " the Haunting " . Part two was released only a good 10 months after the original and this clearly resulted in a hack job that never should have come out . Apart from a bearable intro , in which a deranged James Woods performs a wacky exorcism , " Scary Movie 2 " is nothing but a dreadful series of unfunny jokes , exaggerated graphics and gags that show no insight in the wonderful genre of horror . The complete cast returns and a few fresh ones are introduced ( like the sexy Kathleen Robertson and the tasteless Tori Spelling ) for spending a couple of nights in an ancient mansion where spirits dwell , cats become kick-boxers and the indoor plants smoke pot . Tim Curry , once the star of cult-classics , lowers himself to playing the horny college professor . This film is vulgar , tasteless and very offensive ? yet , I couldn't care less about that ! It's not funny and that's pretty bad for a supposedly hilarious parody / comedy . Avoid in case you've got some brain capacity left !
405169	2020269	79777	3.0	Civilisation is extinct , only boredom remained .	Apparently there are good reasons for this film's obscurity status as well as for the low rating on this wondrous website . Richard Harris doesn't nearly whoop as much butt as I expected in this overall dull and completely unmemorable post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi feature from the late 70's . The one strong point this movie benefices from ( set pieces ) isn't nearly enough to overlook the massive amount of weaknesses ( lack of action , miscast players , no script ? ) , but it has to be said the location spotters and set piece designers pulled off an exquisite job . The story may be non-existent and sadly ruining all its potential , at least all the exteriors look very depressing and the scenery appears to genuinely have lived through a nuclear holocaust . The story , as said , is mundane and hardly worth wasting words on . Falk ( Harris ) and his wife are two of the last few civilized people left in the world , all the rest is either extinct or joined Ravagers clans . When a gang viciously kills his wife ( of screen even , damned ! ) , Falk flees towards ? nowhere . On his journey chased by the same scum that killed his wife , Falk encounters an army sergeant who went a little mad due to the loneliness , a community of cave people and the new & highly enlightened leader of mankind Rann . " Ravagers " had copious possibilities and could have become a great film , but nothing justifies the script boredom ! Falk doesn't even want to avenge the death of his wife ? Bah ! There may be some famous names in this American production , but without hesitating I prefer the anonymous but violence & spectacle-packed Italian exploitation efforts instead .
405810	2020269	337949	4.0	Sickening amateur-trash !	What an absolutely repulsive , shameless and thoroughly depraved short movie this is ! I've been a fan of horror and cult-cinema my entire life , yet I have never encountered something this demented and ? sadly ? pointlessly exploitative . Sick puppy Joe Christ ( who apparently ran for Governor of Texas once ) entirely centers his short story on one of the only topics that is probably better off remaining a taboo , namely the ( sexual ) violation of handicapped people . The film opens with obese and bed-ridden woman Margaret Petrov yelling at her Gothic-dressed teenage nurse because her diaper needs to be changed . The young girl is very mean against her and eventually abandons her . Only two weeks later , the woman gets a new nurse . He ( writer / director Joe Christ ) initially acts helpful and friendly , but pretty soon her puts little statues of Hitler in the woman's room and abuses her . The short film ends with the sick bastard raping the paraplegic woman and killing her by stuffing her mouth full of newspapers . " Crippled " is totally sickening underground-short movie , poorly put together and badly acted . The idea might be disturbing as hell , but the elaboration is too amateurish to be genuinely shocking . What brings certain people to make movies like this , I don't know . But , even more importantly , why do other watch them ?
404542	2020269	424855	4.0	Not that bloody and definitely not that " deep " . . .	I had really hoped to come here with the announcement that the slasher sub-genre is NOT dead ? That there still are enthusiast young directors with bright ideas and a passion for vicious gore or insane plot twists . " Blood Deep " surely looked like such a promising new horror project but , alas , it disappoints . The story revolves on a gang of childhood friends that come together for a reunion at the parental house of pivot character Kate . During a random hypnosis game , one of them suddenly confesses to a murder that was committed in the area over 20 years ago . The synopsis really appealed to me as it reminded me of classic films like " Stand By Me " or Stephen King's " It " , only with a genuine slasher-twist ! Unfortunately , Todd S . Kniss ( cool name , though ) makes the mistake of introducing too many characters and dedicates too much of his time on detailed but unnecessary character drawings . Creating a background or building up atmosphere is good , but " Blood Deep " eventually features too many pointless flashbacks and dead-end story lines . Then , when the long-awaited killing spree breaks loose , the story regretfully reverts to old clichés and predictable situations . Every character has his / her own repressed trauma or hidden teenage crush that comes to the surface during the reunion . The murder sequences are tame ( sometimes even off-screen , God forbid ! ) and the whole film remains politically correct at all times , which was quite a letdown . Perhaps in order to attain wider audiences , Kniss put a lot of effort in stylish cinematography and a creative use of light . He definitely isn't a bad director , also since the entire cast deliver above-average performances and the choice of music is effectively creepy . Maybe " Blood Deep " was just wrongly promoted ? With a slightly less gruesome sounding title and a more coherent plot , this could have been an acceptable psychological thriller . On a totally unimportant side note : I saw this film at the Belgian horror festival and supportive actress Kelci B . Lowry came along to introduce it . Let me assure you she's one gorgeous looking angel with a smile that nearly makes you melt in your seat .
406264	2020269	147582	4.0	Adequately made but passable .	It's probably a bit unfair to compare this version of the Sweeney Todd story ? as well as any other film version ever made before ? with Tim Burton's film which came out in 2007 , but at the same time also inevitable . Burton's movie is like the ultimate adaptation of the Sweeney Todd story , with the perfect cast ( Johnny Depp , Alan Rickman , ? ) , superior production values , dazzling music and breathtaking art-direction . Naturally all previously released versions pale in comparison , but that still doesn't mean they aren't interesting to watch . Despite being " just " a TV-production , talented names were involved in this movie as well , like director John Schlesinger ( " Midnight Cowboy " , " Day of the Locust " ) and veteran actor Ben Kingsley in the titular role . The plot details here differ with most other versions I've seen thus far and particularly Sweeney Todd's motivations to kill the customers that set foot in his barbershop aren't as convincing as usual . Here , Sweeney Todd is a downright merciless and malignant killer whereas in other versions he's more of a mentally tormented individual with pure vengeance on his mind . He kills random and seemingly lonely people in his barbershop and " donates " their bodies to his associate Mrs . Lovett ; who processes the flesh in her acclaimed and world-famous London meat pies . Their morbid business finally raises suspicion when an American investigator arrives in London in search of a former partner . It turns out the missing person was last seen as a customer in Sweeney Todd's barber chair ? " The Tale of Sweeney Todd " is reasonably entertaining throughout , although there are too many dull sequences and moments of substantial emptiness . The infamous lead character's profile is bleak this time around . You can't feel any empathy for him , but neither is he the intellectual and eloquent master villain that he pretends to be . Mostly surprising about this movie is the high amount of nasty make-up effects and grisly images . There are quite a lot of gruesome murders and their bloody aftermaths on display and some of the make up effects are even TOO repulsive , like for example Mrs . Lovett's dental hygiene . Kingsley's performance is far below his usual standards , but he nevertheless remains a professional chameleon actor . The best performance actually comes from the young Sean Flanagan as the mute barber assistant . It's certainly not a bad effort from the legendary director John Schlesinger , but I wouldn't go through too much trouble to purchase a copy .
406663	2020269	70655	4.0	Hey , where has the house gone ? ?	Ah , the house that vanished ? This oddball ( alternate ) title alone was more than enough reason for me to purchase a copy of this obscure and relatively unknown horror flick . But unfortunately , and as the case with too many 70's horror efforts , the title is by far the most exciting aspect about the entire production . This is an unbelievably dull film , stuffed with all the annoying genre-clichés and predictable plot-twist you can possibly think of . During the opening sequences , we follow a young couple ? a photo model and her petty thief lover ? as they break into an isolated house during a foggy night . There they witness a murder and only the girl manages to escape into the woods surrounding the house . And , in case you wonder , the title is really accurate ! When the girl ? Valerie ? wants to show some of her friends where the murder took place , she can't locate the house anymore ! ? Like it vanished into thin air ! Anyway , life goes on and Valerie falls in love with a strangely introvert boy who has a peculiar affair with his aunt and classical music plays whenever he's on screen . The murderer hasn't forgotten about Valerie yet and all kind of sinister happenings lead her back to the murder-house . The plot sounds sensational on paper , and I'm convinced it could have been really great , but the elaboration is very poor and way too slow . The only things to admire during the tedious middle section of the film are main actress Andrea Allan's good looks and her smoking HOT body . Yes , I am aware this is a shallow remark to make , but her spontaneous stripteases truly are the only moments that hold your attention . Director José Ramón Larrez seems to realize this too , since the amount of sleaze and nudity gradually increases as the film reaches towards its climax . There's very little suspense and the few murder scenes are tame and as good as bloodless . The more than obvious denouement is almost like an insult to trained horror fans .
405184	2020269	122070	4.0	Running towards Nothing . . . Again and again and again and again and . . .	The title of this obscure and ( almost righteously ) forgotten 80's slasher inevitably reminds me of The Cure's mega-smash-monster hit song with the same title , hence a piece of the lyrics in the title-section of this user comment . Also , I didn't have anything else to say that was useful , anyway . But hey , " The Forest " isn't totally hopeless and not even that bad , actually . If nothing else , at least it obeys the , admittedly unwritten , first rule of 80's slasher : kill someone within the first 10 minutes of playtime . Sure you've heard about the basic premise of this film a dozen times before , but don't let that discourage you from watching it , as " The Forest " has a couple of things more to offer than just an appealingly sinister cover image . It's actually a bit of an atypical 80's slasher ! The main characters aren't ordinary brainless teenagers and the script has solid ambitions towards supernaturalism . The concept isn't always successful , let alone plausible , but it's more than interesting enough to hold your attention and there are even are a couple of surprisingly strong moments of tension and plot twists to enjoy . Two married couples decide to go camping in the most isolated woods of California , but due to a stupid bet the wives travel separately from their husbands . Barely set up for the night , they receive uncanny visits from a mother looking for her two children , the children themselves and finally the father who's out hunting for human flesh . The demented family may be real or imaginary , but the women are definitely in danger and by the time their husbands arrive , they have already vanished . The men too encounter the family , and they find out more about the slightly dysfunction background . " The Forest " is a weird and unusual film , to say the least . It's not exactly a masterpiece of plotting , but the thoroughly strange atmosphere will certainly appeal to open-minded fans of 80's horror . The murders are fairly gruesome and will-filmed , including a slit throat and a painful saw-massacre , and the filming locations are stunningly beautiful . The more you contemplate about the story and its abrupt twists , the less it makes any sense , so my advice would just be to enjoy this odd viewing experience for as long as it lasts and not a minute longer . The acting performances are just above average , the music is okay and at least director Donald Jones ( also responsible for the 70's exploitation-sickie " Schoolgirls in Chains " ) tried to be a little more creative that the majority of 80's horror films . Too bad it ultimately fails .
405658	2020269	92115	4.0	Harry Potter and the Troll in the dungeon ?	Small spoiler alert . . . Troll is an incredibly silly and cheesy movie . It's actually too dumb for words but yet I feel like I can't be too harsh on it . After all , it's just a meaningless attempt to create a morbid fairy tale and the cast and crew obviously showed a lot of enthusiasm and goodwill . It's about an unintelligent family that moves to a new apartment . Both father and son are named Harry Potter . . . Now , where have I heard that name before ? Hmm , I wonder if J . K Rowling found a bit of inspiration in this movie . Anyway , there's a Troll in the dungeon of the apartment and he takes over the body and personality of family's daughter . How does the Troll come there ? Who knows . . . Why of all places did he chose that apartment ? ? Who cares . . . The troll doesn't just kill people , he turns them into complete forests by one single touch . Out of these forests come new trolls and lots of trees . So basically , this is just a very environmental movie ! ! I bet it's an absolute favorite among members of Greenpeace ! ! And it doesn't stop there , the new breed of Trolls even sing stupid songs . Go figure , that must be one of the cheesiest sequences in the history of cinema . Other than these brilliant aspects , Troll contains talking mushrooms , an ancient witch ( who turns into a beautiful princess in the blink of an eye ) and intelligent midgets . There even is an authentic witch in this movie . She goes from old , wrinkly granny to hot blond babe in blink of an eye . If you really haven't got anything better to do with your time ? give Troll a chance . The charm and amateurism of it may touch you . But , whatever you do , avoid the sequel like the plague ! ! Troll 2 is a real disaster and generally considered to be one of the worst movies ever made .
405250	2020269	117611	4.0	Total eclipse of the brain cells . . .	" Shadow Builder " doesn't only dispose of the ugliest VHS-cover in the history of cinema , it also is one of the most ineptly bizarre films I ever had the ( mis ) fortune of seeing . The film is a little bit based on a short story by Bram Stoker ( you know , the guy who gained some fame with his vampire novel ) but the scriptwriter obviously had a lot of fun adding insane stuff that comes from his own imagination , like a swearing priest who operates 9mm guns ? with laser beams ! Believe it or not , but there are many interesting ideas and ingenious details noticeable in " Shadow Builder " , and with a slightly more coherent script , the film might have been very good . It introduces a quite original monster , in the shape of Darth Vader-resembling demon that can only reign in the shadows . He has been summoned by a bunch of freaks and now he's looking for 12-year-old Chris Hatcher . During the sun eclipse , demon-guy will use Chris to make the world come to an end because he was born with stigmata . Yes , very clever ! ! Michael Rooker stars as the troubled priest who stalks the demon all over the country and Tony " Candyman " Todd has an insignificant role as the town's nut . The film is actually quite enjoyable , but only during the moments when the plot doesn't necessarily have to make sense , like for example the neat sequences of the town in chaos or when the demon possesses random souls in order to gain power . Director Jamie Dixon tries to uphold a constant level of action and most cast members seem to fulfill their job with great devotion . I can't properly judge the use of special effects , though . Some visual gimmicks are quite well done whereas others are lousy and on the verge of pitiful . Definitely not a must-see , but if you're a fan of silly horror , it's worth watching when it comes on TV or something .
404993	2020269	486614	4.0	Lie still . . . and sleep tight !	Well here's a movie that probably will be long forgotten before it properly hits the lowest shelves of second-class rental stores ? " Lie Still " , the debut film of Sean Hogan , simply hasn't got anything to offer that makes it memorable . Gorehounds will drop out instantly , as the film doesn't feature the slightest amount of action or excitement . Partly because there wasn't enough budget for special effects but mainly because Hogan clearly intended to bring an old-fashioned atmospheric and story-driven ghost story . Fine by me ! I encourage the revival of intelligent suspense-horror , but the problem here is that the script of " Lie Still " is as superficial and basic as can be . After the painful break-up with his girlfriend , unemployed and soft drugs addicted John Hare moves into a cheap room of an ancient house . He hopes to take a fresh start , but the house soon turns out to be a haunted place where the restless spirits of previous residents still dwell around . A premise like this immediately reminds you of popular films like " The Others " or " The Devil's Backbone " and thus you begin to prepare yourself for a supernatural and totally unexpected twist in the end . The problem with " Lie Still " is that this particular twist never comes ! Okay ? so there are ghosts in the house and all this relates to the vicious history of the house's first owner who's buried in the backyard . That's it ? Where's the climax ? This movie ends exactly like it began : slow , uninteresting and anonymous . The only positive elements I can possibly mention are a handful of atmospheric sequences and only ONE ingenious finding ( the people inside the television set ) . I picked up somewhere that the screenplay was written in only a couple of weeks ( I believe that ) , but that it took another two years before the required budget was raised . What budget ? I bet most of the money was spent on coffee & medication in order to keep cast and crew members awake during filming . The acting performances are fairly satisfying , though , and Hogan's inexperienced approach of the genre occasionally does look charming .
405088	2020269	63595	4.0	Feels like a Russ Meyer film but without the cleavage . . .	This angry female-biker flick was my first acquaintance with the legendary director Hershell Gordon Lewis . I'm much more looking forward to seeing some of his most controversial films like ' Two Thousand Maniacs ' , ' Blood Feast ' or ' The Gruesome Twosome ' but I consider this to be a reasonable appetizer . It's not nearly as shocking or offensive as it might look and the script contains very few material to make a movie of . Loud-mouthed bitches who drink and race all day , while they consider all males to be ? mothers ! They live by strange rules ( for example : when you donate too much attention to the same guy , you're out of the group ) and organize orgies with a cabin full of studs ! A couple of persons get severely mutilated and one of them even loses his head but , other than this , there isn't much gore or action to detect . Best aspects about this film actually are the sleazy-sounding title and the opening song , entitled ' Get off the Road ' . Lewis ' She-Devils on Wheels is a very campy film ! Some of the dialogue is really hilarious , but almost literally impossible to understand . This film decently represents the she-exploitation subgenre . But not nearly as good as Russ Meyer's legendary ' Faster Pussycat , Kill ! Kill ' which was made 3 years earlier . The shrews in this particular film were a lot meaner , relentless and ? most importantly ? sexier .
406285	2020269	83660	5.0	Beware of Murderous has-been 50's Crooner !	Yay ! Another totally obscure early 80's slasher no one has ever heard of ! I often wonder where they keep coming from . Are the 80's still going on in some kind of alternate dimension or something ? How else would you explain the never-ending upstream of long lost slashers ? Anyway , this one isn't very good , but I can honestly state that I've struggled myself through 80's slashers that are much worse and yet somehow enjoy a mild cult reputation . " Blood Song " only enjoys the status of obscurity , but at least it offers a couple of ingenious gimmicks , an occasionally unsettling atmosphere , some nasty killings , a handful of likable characters and ? not to forget ? a unique member in the cast of nobodies ! Ladies and gentlemen : washed up 50's and early 60's crooner Frankie Avalon ! And in all fairness , I also have to admit that the script of " Blood Song " attempts to be slightly more than just a random slasher . The plot tries to spiritually link the female protagonist Marion to a fugitive killer through a blood transfusion , nightmarish POV visions and ? flute music ! " Blood Song " opens with a typically clichéd horror scene , yet with an unexpected twist at the end of it . A young boy witnesses his father killing the unfaithful wife , her lover and himself . What's a poor kid to do at such a traumatizing and future-determining point in life ? Well , play the wooden flute his daddy hand-made for him of course ! More than 20 years later he escapes from a mental asylum , still holding on to his wooden flute , and goes on a rampage where he kills everyone who negatively criticizes the music he produces . Meanwhile , Marion witnesses all of his vile acts in visions because the killer once anonymously donated blood to her when she was involved in a car accident . A confrontation between the two is inevitable , but not before the musical killer eliminates some more random victims first ! Like often the case in this genre , " Blood Song " is a lot more enjoyable if you don't ask too many questions regarding the plot's plausibility and don't bother about the multiple giant holes . All the ingenious aspects of the plot sadly vanish when the girl and the killer first stand face to face and " Blood Song " then reverts to an ordinary stalk-n-slash flick , albeit with an odd father-daughter relationship sub plot . Frankie Avalon isn't too bad , but he hasn't got many lines and what he says doesn't always make much sense . Funny detail is how the script never explains why they sent little Pauly to a mental institution in the first place . Okay , he witnessed a triple murder and suicide but he didn't commit any acts of insanity at young age himself , at least nothing hints in that direction . Since when is it customary to send traumatized kids to an asylum instead of to foster parents or orphanages ? Because now it seems that he only really lost his sanity whilst being committed . A-ah , ( unintentional ? ) food for thought in a mediocre & insignificant 80's horror movie !
404293	2020269	47976	5.0	Remarkable little mind-explosion !	Where to begin with this occult little gem ? To be very honest , I haven't quite figured out what it is yet . Dementia stands as a strange experiment and worth analyzing , that's for sure . I'm probably giving it too much honor now , but I risk to say it's a dared and surrealist highlight of expressionism and no-budget cinema-making ? . BUT , in constant combination with amateurism and wannabe-psychology . You might even say it looks like and Ed Wood film while he had a moment of clarity and ingenious brilliancy . For not more than an hour , we follow around a lonely and seemly anti-social woman in a cruel neighborhood of prostitution , orgies and murder . She suffers from visions of childhood trauma's while she's filling up with fury and hatred towards a rich , ignorant man . She kills him and flees ? chased by the police and haunted by her own morbid imagination . Keeping in mind this film was made in 1953 , it becomes even more interesting ! The US censorship didn't like it at all and the film barely received showings ? No surprises there because , even though the film doesn't contain explicit violence , it's very unpleasant and disturbing to look at . Every character that walks through the screen is unsympathetic and someone you don't want to run into in a dark alley . The atmosphere this film breathes feels like David Lynch's Eraserhead avant-la-lettre , and I wouldn't be surprised if he found some of his inspiration and enthusiasm in Dementia . This film is perhaps a little too weak and messy to refer to as avant-garde , but it does float somewhere between that and cheap B-cinema . Up to you to decide where it's categorized best ! One thing is sure , though ? Dementia is food for thought at film-Academies . I saw the original version of this lost film at a festival , on the big screen and guided by a life-orchestra of cello's and a piano . The film itself doesn't contain any dialogues and therefore this chilling music brought it up to an almost unbearable cult-experience .
405927	2020269	180093	5.0	Drugs are bad , mmmkay ?	Requiem for a Dream must be one of the most unnecessarily overhyped films of the last few decades . By no means it's a bad film but ? is it really worth all the praising it gets and the commotion it caused ? After all , Darren Aranofski's film based on the novel by Herbert Selby is only stating the obvious ? Drugs are bad and they will , eventually , lead you into a downward spiral of madness and destroy your life . When talking about the screenplay , Requiem for a Dream has nothing new or extraordinary to offer . We follow the unhealthy actions of 4 people . Jarred Leto and Marlon Wayans star as two Coney Island junkies who want to get rich fast and easy by dealing drugs . Leto's character Harry is doing it all for his beautiful girlfriend Marion ( Jennifer Connelly ) so she can open her very own fashion store , selling her proper designs . Ellen Burstyn puts down an amazing performance as Leto's TV-addicted mother who gets hooked on diet pills after she's made believe to appear on her favorite show . I repeat , Requiem for a Dream certainly isn't a bad film . It even is a very well elaborated story with fascinating acting . But the main problem , I think , is that Arranofski too easily thinks that he created a controversial shocker . And that's not the case ? It might look like he directed the perfect " Anti-Drug-Therapy " movie to him , but he's about 10 years too late for that . Fans of art-house cinema will merely look at it as ' been there , seen that ' . The visual experiments often annoy and the characters are a bit too shallow to feel any compassion for . The musical score , however , is simply brilliant and probably even the most powerful aspect about the entire film . Although I haven't been able to find it yet , I'm expecting a lot more from ' Last Exit to Brooklyn ' , which was also adapted from a Herbert Selby novel . Requiem for a Dream is recommended ? but please don't rate it here on this site . It's already ranked way too high in the IMDb top 250 .
406671	2020269	74478	5.0	90 minutes of Laura Gemser and nothing else ? ? Works for me !	This is the first , and most likely the only Joe D'Amato film ever to hit Belgian television screens . Quite logical , since the titles on his repertoire go from nauseating horror films ( " Anthropophagous " , " Beyond the Darkness " ) to hardcore porno flicks ( " Tarzan X " ) and sometimes even a combination of both ( " Erotic Nights of the Living Dead " , " Porno Holocaust " ) . D'Amato pretty much behaves himself here and follows the formula of the original " Black Emanuelle " film , released one year before , but that doesn't mean avid D'Amato-fans have to worry , as there still is an enormous amount of genuine sleaze to enjoy . " Emanuelle in Bangkok " has virtually no plot at all and you can't even fully believe the title , as our sexy protagonist's journey to the Far East is very brief and she only has contact with two Asian people ( a masseuse and a bell-boy ) . The film most " crucial " sequences are set on a cruise ship and in Morocco , where she has an off / on relationship with a persistent archaeologist . I have no complaints , though , since the camera beautifully captures Laura Gemser's erotic adventures with men , women , couples and herself . Joe D'Amato's trademarks are bizarrely tinted sexual situations , and there's only one such sequence in this film , namely the Japanese stripper who puts ping-pong balls up her vagina . Weird ? One aspect about " Emanuelle in Bangkok " , as well as in the entire cycle , is downright brilliant and that's the music . Nico Fidenco's score is mesmerizing and , without exaggerating , at least ten times better than every other score that ever won an Oscar . The dazzling soundtrack alone makes " Emanuelle in Bangkok " a true cult classic that every fan of the genre will enjoy watching .
406480	2020269	268995	5.0	Smarmy tearjerker ? but professionally made , of course .	I'm one of those very few people who are actually convinced that there's a brilliant actor hidden behind the rubber face of Jim Carrey , so I was rather looking forward to finally see The Majestic . I prepared myself to witness a lot of sappy dialogues and dramatic sequences which are inevitable in Darabont's movies but he really has excelled himself here ? Boy , what a corny film ! For two and a half straight hours , The Majestic desperately tries to bring tears to your eyes . All elements to make lonely housewives and hurt romanticists cry are present ? Carrey plays a Hollywood scriptwriter in the early 50's ? America is recovering from their WWII losses and the cowardly hunt for communism and other supposable threats to society is open . Peter Appleton ( Jim Carrey ) is suspected of being a communist and loses his job . He crashes his car and end up in a small , forsaken town ? suffering from amnesia ! He gets mistaken for a lost son who returned from the war after all and suddenly , everything goes really easy ? Peter ( alias Luke Trimble ) re-opens the local movie theater with he father , he gets the most beautiful girl in town and they throw him parties ! ! Naturally , his memory slowly returns and a huge disappointment for the little community is inescapably . The story is so ordinary , the character so typical and the events so routine that you're actually wondering why you continue to look at times . This film is way too long ( Darabont makes a point of stretching simple stories endlessly ) and the obtained sentiment is just too fake for you to care . Especially the entire end-scene in court annoys ? . It seems to last forever and you can almost hear Darabont begging for you to cry with his film . The attempts to ' touch ' the audience are almost pathetic and destroy the good basic plot idea . When you ignore the smarmy script , there remain only a few things to admire like the decent acting performances by Jim Carrey , Martin Landau and the girl who plays the love-interest . I already forgot her name , but she previously starred in several episodes of the X-Files . And of course there's the scenery ? Darabont gives an adorable portrayal of the US in the early 50's with sublime decorations and multiple tributes to classic cinema . The settings and locations are very realistic and breath an irresistible fifties atmosphere ? but , I hardly consider this a triumph because Darabont probably had a large budget to spend on this .
404953	2020269	74575	5.0	God is a Spaghetti-Cowboy !	The indescribably poor DVD-quality almost ruined the entire movie for me . " God's Gun " is part of a Three-Pack DVD of Lee Van Cleef spaghetti western films , the other two being " Kid Vengeance " and " Death Rides a Horse " . The box looks nice and it's a great initiative to release more of Van Cleef's work on DVD , but the picture and sound quality are terribly , terribly poor ! The colors are faded and most of the time you can't even make out the eyes or the expressions on the characters ' faces . It's far worse than a VHS which stood on the bottom shelf of a videostore for the past 20 years , so watch out in case you consider purchasing this puppy on DVD . The film itself is fine , and I don't really understand all the harsh and negative comments by the other reviewers . The plot isn't exactly original and the film clearly lacks the touch of a professional genre director like Leone or Corbucci , but as long as you're simply expecting to see macho cowboys wiping each other out with pistols and shotguns , you can't possibly be disappointed . Any western that combines the talents and charisma of Lee Van Cleef and Jack Palance is worth tracking down if you ask me , and even more so if it also contains guest appearances by Richard Boone and Sybil Danning . Van Cleef plays the priest of a peaceful little town that suddenly gets invaded by a sadistic gang of criminals led by Jack Palance . The priest is killed when he tries to uphold justice in the little town , but his youthful acolyte escapes and seeks the help of twin-brother Lewis who lives in Mexico . Together they return to avenge Father John's dead and clear the town of crime once and for all . The script of " God's Gun " is very clichéd and contains too many stupid improbabilities . For example , Johnny finds Lewis in less than two days even though he only knew he lived " somewhere in Mexico " and ? moreover ? he can't even ask for directions because he's struck mute . For some reason , there are also two totally redundant and overlong flashback sequences that don't add anything to the story . Naturally , the cast of characters are dreadful stereotypes , including the drunkard Sheriff and the gorgeous , voluptuous wenches in the local saloon . The music and many of the inventive camera angles are directly stolen from " The Good , The Bad and The Ugly " . Oh well , at least the gunfights are violent & nasty , and Jack Palance is the ultimately cool baddie .
404765	2020269	60616	5.0	Passable early Giallo	" Murder Clinic " is one of them obscure and early ( mid-60's ) Gialli that you'll probably never see , unless you're willing to purchase a prehistoric VHS copy or ? even worse - a bootleg DVD ripped from the aforementioned prehistoric tape . You know those things that are practically unwatchable because the original colors faded and the picture is constantly fuzzy ? In other words this Giallo is only meant for the eyes of avid Giallo-buffs , as I sincerely doubt a proper release on disc will ever follow . " Murder Clinic " is a very passable Italian horror effort , but nevertheless amusing and it certainly contains a handful of potentially good ideas . It was the sixties , so Gialli movies still leaned towards Gothic settings and darkly sinister filming location . But , on the other hand , the Giallo-formula was still relatively new and thus the screenplay ( penned down by veterans Ernesto Gastaldi and Luciano Martino ) is very straightforward with clear twists and logical red herrings . The year is 1870 and the sinister events take place in a private clinic run by the demanding Dr . Vance and his obnoxious wife Liz . The movie doesn't waste too much time , as there quickly pops up a hooded killer who waves around a sharp razor and butchers patients as well as staff members . There are a number of possibilities for whom the killer might turn out to be , and the least you can say is that the denouement is acceptable . The murders sequences are decent , obviously not outrageously gross but definitely bloodier than I anticipated for a 60's film . There are some tedious parts and the acting performances ? with the exception of William Berger as the Doc ? are very much below average . The music is atmospheric and luckily the film only ran for a good 80 minutes . Not so much because I was bored to death , but because the incredibly poor bootleg disc hurt my eyes and ears .
405707	2020269	300051	5.0	It's sure ain't no ' Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back '	I went to see ' Jersey Girl ' because I'm a Kevin Smith fan . Other than that , I had no particular reason to check it out since romantic comedy / drama isn't really my thing . And yet , I enjoyed watching ' Jersey Girl ' ? because it had heart and a lot of subtle self-regulating humor . Pure talking comedy , it's Smith's least good film , since his talent usually lies in the smart pop-art remarks and the endless amount of slick cinema-references in the dialogue . None of these aspects features in Jersey Girl and also the characters are a lot less eccentric than usual . It's an emotional driven picture with a small amount of very funny sequences . Ben Affleck ( who previously did some of his best work with Kevin Smith in film like Chasing Amy ) is a successful PR-man who has everything ? a beautiful wife ( Jennifer Lopez ) , a successful career and a baby on the way . He loses all of this in the blink of an eye when his love-interest dies while giving birth to their daughter . He returns to living with his father in his Jersey hometown and accepts a non-responsible job . Seven years later , he still lives there and stills his sexual hunger by renting porno-films . He makes acquaintance with the cute videostore girl ( Liv Tyler ) and raises his daughter the best he can . But , Ollie ? that's the name of Affleck's character ? desires to go back to the big city and pick up his PR job again . The typical ( read : annoying ) clichés start to pile up at this point ? Will the charm of the little town triumph over the boisterous life in the big city ? Is Ollie going to make it in time to see his little girl's school play ? You all know the answers , I bet . But I'm not complaining ? as mentioned above , some sequences are truly hilarious highlights ( for example : Affleck trying to explain the difference between boys and girls to his daughter ) and remarkable cameos by giant stars ( Will Smith ) or other Kevin Smith regulars ( Jason Lee and Matt Damon ) . All in one , a decent motion picture that you'll forget about soon , but it'll affect you while it lasts .
405185	2020269	94627	5.0	Hack ' em up GOOD !	Routine and by-the-numbers 80's slasher , but nonetheless a very entertaining one albeit a bit slow in places . " Edge of the Axe " is remotely gorier and creepier than most of the contemporary slasher efforts , because the killer wears an uncanny plaster mask and uses ( like the title makes pretty clear ) a sharp ' n shiny axe to turn his victims into ? and I quote one of the cop characters here ? hamburger meat ! The killer targets yummy women living in two remote neighbor towns named Patterson and Paddock . The exaggeratedly imbecilic police officers try to pretend that even the most obvious murder cases are ordinary accidents , or in the best case , unfortunate suicide . The plot doesn't provide too many clues for the audiences to join guessing who the killer is , but don't bother anyway , as there are a couple of delightfully absurd and unpredictable twists near the end of the film . Downright AWESOME end shot , by the way . The direction in " Edge of the Axe " is much better and more stylish than in most 80's slasher , but I didn't except anything else , since José Ramón Larraz isn't just some randomly assigned director , but the creator of a couple of underrated and marvelous 70's gems , like " Vampyres " , " The Blood Virgin " and " The House that Vanished " . Mostly thanks to his skills and experience , " Edge of the Axe " is occasionally atmospheric and even suspenseful in places . The special effects are adequate and the imagery ( like chopped off heads floating in the water and decomposed corpses falling from attics ) is suitably nasty , making this an above average and recommendable effort . Larraz was also responsible for another obscure slasher puppy with an appealing title , namely " Rest in Pieces " . Based on this movie , I think I should start looking for the other one , too .
406572	2020269	121556	5.0	Derivative , but mildly entertaining slasher	This abnormally obscure early 90's slasher ( it's nearly impossible to find ) attempts to blend different styles and sub genres , like desert horror , textbook teen-slasher and psychological thriller . The story's main influence obviously comes from the stalking - vehicles - without - a - driver classics , namely " The Car " and Steven Spielberg's " Duel " , but the atmosphere and especially the final plot-twists are more reminiscent to wannabe intellectual thrillers , which is quite a shame . Personally , I'm convinced " Mirage " would have been much more efficient without the pseudo-psychological end twists . As the title implies , the script wants you to constantly doubt whether or not the terrorizing black pick-up truck is real or simply a mirage . The structure doesn't really work and the film honestly isn't very good , but at least the straightforward action sequences and gory deaths make it worthwhile . Three young couples , stereotype hot girls and hunky boys , head out to the middle of the desert to go camping , play stupid ball games and have a whole lot of sex ; preferably in driving vehicles ( excellent opening sequence ) . Right from the beginning , and for no apparent reason , there's a sinister black pick-up truck with heavy lights following them around and observing their every move . Using the malevolent car as a powerful weapon , the teenagers are quickly wiped out and pretty soon Chris is the only one left to confront the psycho behind the wheel . The death sequences are ingenious and suitably gory ( one poor bloke is dismembered when his legs are simultaneously chained to a tree and the vehicle ) and the desert setting easily creates the right atmosphere of helplessness . The acting performances are atrocious , but the girls are pretty and provide some welcome ? albeit totally gratuitous ? nudity . The pick-up truck is simply awesome and undeniably menacing . " Mirage " is good fun as long as you completely forget the last five minutes .
404612	2020269	67486	5.0	Interesting , but difficult to follow	Small spoilers . . . . I saw this movie under the title : the Road Builder . Only that title alone sounded interesting to me . I got especially interested when I learned that the screenplay was written by Roald Dahl . We all know that he wrote some remarkable stories , but most his most memorable work in the field of children's literature . The screenplay of The Road Builder isn't really meant for a young audience . . . It's a dark story and really creepy from time to time . It's very psychological and therefore difficult to follow at certain moments . I saw this gothic suspense thriller on TCM but without any subtitles . So the dialogues were hard to follow sometimes . Especially with a rather complicated story . It's about a spinster , Maura , who lives with her blind mother is a large house . Their lives change when a young handyman - named Billy - comes to live with them . Billy is charming and really helpful around the house , but he hides some terrifying secrets . It seemed that Billy faced some trauma's in his childhood years and he still hasn't put them behind him . Thus , some nights . . . Billy goes out on his motorcycle to do horrible things . The developing of the story is really fascinating and also the terrific acting performances keep you close to the screen . Patricia Neal - who was married with Roald Dahl for forty years and gave him 5 children - is really outstanding in her role of shy and quiet middle-aged woman . Also the young Nicolas Clay impresses as Billy . Clay died in 2000 after a long disease . The Road Builder certainly is worth a watch when you're in the mood for seeing a scary psychological thriller or a deep character study . Just make sure there aren't too many aspects to distract you . You'll need full attention to enjoy this movie .
404557	2020269	75334	5.0	To The Hammer Fans . . . . A Disappointment !	Before having seen " To The Devil A Daughter " , it'll definitely remind you of Hammer's 1968 classic " The Devil Rides Out " . Christopher Lee is present again ( no surprises here , though ) but it's also the legendary horror studios ' second attempt to a black magic occult thriller ( both were based on Dennis Wheatley novels , by the way ) . Yet , you'll soon discover that the two bear very little comparison . " The Devil Rides Out " might easily be Hammer's finest effort whereas " To The Devil A Daughter " ranks among the worst ? The screenplay is very inherent , a lot of plot-twists and events don't make the slightest bit of sense and ? most of all ? the film has the most unsatisfying ending in horror history . The basic premise is promising , though , and introduces a satanic cult neatly disguised as a Catholic Church community . The leader , who else than the almighty Christopher Lee , comes to claim the pure soul of soon-to-be 18 virgin Catherine , as agreed with her father in a devilish pact when she was born . After performing a bloody ritual , she'd become Satan's representative on earth , but her father tries to avoid this from happening by asking the help of an occult novelist . He manages to hide Catherine for a good while , but can she really escape her occult fade ? Despite a couple of seriously unsettling moments and great acting performances of the entire cast , this film lacks a whole lot of impact . Much more like a good old engaging Hammer film , " To The Devil A Daughter " feels like a typical 70's Satan-flick in the trend of " The Exorcist " . As a matter of course , it's much better than all the contemporary rip-off's featuring mad-raving nuns , sexually perverted priests and possessed babies but , to real Hammer fans , it'll definitely be a disappointment .
404532	2020269	24593	5.0	Who's your daddy ?	Exploitative cinema seemly is of all times ? Even in the classic and respectable 30's , whenever a slick producer saw the chance of making extra money of a certain success-formula , he took it . And righteously so ! Who could possibly blame director Ernest B . Schoedsack and his film crew for trying to gain some more dollars out the tremendous box office hit " King Kong " , released only 8 months earlier ? Unlike the milestone his daddy starred in , " Son of Kong " certainly isn't a must-see film , but it nonetheless remains an enjoyable , light-headed little film that still features all the nifty elements of its predecessor , only to a lesser degree . The mini-ape is still an engaging Willis O'Brien creation but his appearance is a lot more brief and comical . The story of this sequel supposedly takes place one month after King Kong climbed up the Empire State Building , and has Carl Denham ( Robert Armstrong reprises his role ) fleeing from all his New York creditors . He sails off to see and , along with a whole bunch of people that aren't worth introducing , he washes ashore Skull Island again where they encounter the son of King Kong . The film is never boring , but it's totally pointless and it can't seem to decide whether it wants to be adventurous or simply cute . Also , it's difficult to accept the character of Carl Denham as a hero all of a sudden , since he was the greedy bastard responsible for King Kong's downfall . Oh , and another thing ? I'm not a great biologist , but apes don't come crawling out of eggs as far as I know . So , assuming King Kong isn't a hermaphrodite , there should also be a Mother Kong somewhere ! Where the hell is she ? Wasn't her story interesting enough to tell ? Is she such an atypical female that she decided to stay out of the picture during the cinematic adventures of both her man and son ? Or maybe she went back to living with Mother-in-Law Kong when she noticed her husband fancied Fay Wray and followed her all the way to New York ? Now that's something to think about !
406386	2020269	69956	6.0	Dances With Wolves . . . with a cannibal-twist !	Deep River Savages represents Umberto Lenzi's first steps in the notorious field of cannibalism and jungle adventure movies . This infamous director will gross out entire audiences during the early 80's , with vicious cult flicks like ' Cannibal Ferox ' ; ' Eaten Alive by the Cannibals ' and ' Nightmare City ' . This film is more like a pioneer and Lenzi carefully explores the primitive jungle communities and their traditional rites . Deep River Savages isn't half as gross as the title and DVD-cover leads you to believe and it basically is a social portrait mixed with an authentic love-story ! ? Believe it or not ! Actually ? the best way to describe this film is : Dances with Wolves ? with cannibals ! The plots of both movies are pretty much alike , the only differences are the setting and the fact Kevin Costner's film is praised all over the world while nobody has ever heard of Deep River Savages . John ? an Englishman ? is traveling across Eastern Asia when he gets mixed up in a bar-fight . He accidentally kills a man and flees on one of the many unknown rivers . He ends up as a prisoner in primitive tribe , somewhere deep in the jungle . The aboriginals actually form a rather joyful community ! They spend their days watching animal-fights ( roosters and snakes versus martens ) and swimming naked . Our ? civilized ' friend is tortured at first and he attempts to escape . But , pretty soon he falls in love with the local beauty ( Me Me Lai ? who looks even better here than she did in Deodato's Jungle Holocaust ) and marries her . John feels at home there now and he even helps the tribe in fighting the sadistic enemy-tribe from the across the river . The film contains very few action sequences and is overall pretty boring . I don't blame Lenzi for this , though . Even though I prefer his later splatter films , you have to keep in mind this movie was made in 1972 ! Deep River Savages also looks very cheap , amateurish and the cinematography isn't anywhere near as stunning as in other cannibal films . The whole movie depends on Me Me Lai's beautiful naked body and the short ( but action-packed ) climax . Nonetheless , it stays recommended to Italian horror-admirers who're interested in the roots of ' Savage Cinema ' .
406626	2020269	274175	6.0	Evil has two faces ? and one filthy long fingernail !	The last-but-one installment in Hammer's House of Horror saga is a very atmospheric and tense tale , but sadly lacking excitement and memorable horrific moments . It's perhaps the most mysterious episode of them all , since the plot effectively keeps you guessing about what's going on , but the climax is unsatisfying and not answering all the questions that were raised during the build-up . " The Two Faces of Evil " opens with a model family on the road for a well-deserved vacation when the wife suddenly spots a mysteriously uncanny figure dressed in a long yellow raincoat . This same figure is standing at the side of the road in the pouring rain later and they offer him a ride . He promptly attacks the father and the car crashes . The wife and young son wake up unharmed in the hospital , but the father is heavily injured with pieces of glass stuck in his throat . The woman is asked to identify the body of the hitcher ? who supposedly died in the accident ? but he looks identical like her husband , only missing a hand . When they continue their vacation in spite of everything , Janet notices that her husband behaves very strangely and she even starts to wonder if isn't someone else ? The storyline is rather ambitious and atypical for a Hammer production , with subtle creepiness instead of wild shocks and almost no bloodshed at all . In some aspects , the story reminded me of the Sci-Fi classic " Invasion of the Body Snatchers " and there definitely are worse things to get compared with ! Alan Gibson's ( " The Satanic Rites of Dracula " ) direction is masterful and very surefooted , with a detailed eye for the macabre set pieces . Especially the scenes in the hospital's eerie mortuary are gripping . Gibson was also responsible for the absolute greatest episode in the H . H . H series , namely " The Silent Scream " starring Peter Cushing and Brian Cox . This episode's cast doesn't star familiar names , but the performances are really good and convincing .
404907	2020269	90327	6.0	Modest 80's horror classic	Well-scripted and fairly original 80's horror with quite a lot of suspense and excitement and only a forgivable amount of clichés and flaws . Writer / director Kevin S . Tenney obviously saw a lot of horror movies about exorcism and spiritual possession in his own youth and he now came up with a similar film-idea , mainly revolving on a mysterious ouija-board . This magical form of communication brings Linda Brewster into contact with the spirit of deceased 10-year-old David , but what she doesn't realize is that she's also opening a portal for the restless spirit of a serial-killer to come back . Linda's boyfriend and ex-boyfriend have to team up in order to prevent Linda from getting possessed by the malicious spirit of " Malfeitor " . This low-budget film is surprisingly stylish and not half as cheesy as it may look . All the characters ( except for that messed up punk-medium ) are very likable , which is a rare thing in 80's horror movies , and the inventive screenplay delivers a couple of genuine frights . The amount of gore is limited , but definitely satisfying . Kevin S . Tenney directed a large number of overlooked but worthwhile B-movies , but this is his best one alongside " Night of the Demons " .
406095	2020269	78925	6.0	Shark Hunters of the Caribbean : Diving for Lost Treasures	" Guardians of the Deep " could more or less be described as a rip-off of Peter Benchley's " The Deep " , only ? this version is a whole lot better and numberless times more entertaining ! It's a very silly and immensely grotesque adventure movie , with highly implausible stunts and unrealistic characters , but the whole thing is so spirited and so vividly directed by Enzo G . Casterllari that you can't help but be amused . Spaghetti western hero Franco Nero ( wearing a blond wig that nearly makes him unrecognizable ) stars as a treasure hunter on a quest to recover $10 million from a plane wreck that lies on the bottom of the Caribbean Sea . The valuable loot is located nearby a shark-infested cave , but that can't be an issue , as Mike also happens to be a fearless and ruthless shark hunter who doesn't even hesitate to crash down in the open sea with a parachute to take on a Tiger Shark with his bare hands , now how about that ? ! ? His search is complicated when other parties learn about the treasure as well , like a CIA agent on " holiday " and a bunch of corrupt local police officers . " Guardians of the Deep " features a constantly high level of spectacle & suspense and the film benefices extremely from the lusciously exotic photography by Raúl Cubero . This film is very beautiful to look at ? and to listen to , as the De Angelis brothers ' score is downright phenomenal and dreamy . Although not exactly a legit entry in the " Sharksploitation " sub genre ( like " Great White " , " Monster Shark " or " Tintorera " ) , this film contains some of the greatest and most masterfully enacted shark attack sequences ever in low-budget cult cinema ! The sharks in the cave assist Mike during the finale and explicitly devour a couple of his opponents . The action scenes are impressive at sea as well as on the mainland , with tough macho fistfights , wild car chases and shootouts . This puppy is quite obscure and difficult to find , but worth tracking down if you like tropical settings , shark-action and Castellari's versatile repertoire .
406069	2020269	94225	6.0	Until death do us part . . . . violently !	Inconspicuous but nevertheless stylish Lamberto Bava thriller with a couple of remotely suspenseful sequences and an attractive Italian cast . The plot sounds very familiar but , although Bava doesn't really pretend to be original , he still manages to make his film look innovating and compelling at times . The beautiful Linda and her virulent lover Carlo just killed Luca , Linda's fatuous husband , and they continue running the hotel / restaurant near a popular fishing-lake . Eight years later , however , a hitch-hiker shows up and he seems to know alarmingly many details about Linda's first marriage . Linda and Carlo start to distrust each other and even her little son Alex begins to suffer from nightmares about a murdered man that comes crawling out of the muddy ground . . . Indeed , the plot resembles a lot like " The Postman Always Rings Twice " but - since it's Bava - the killings are nastier and the characters are more deranged . When it comes to atmosphere and horrific mood-setting , this definitely is one of Lamberto Bava's best accomplishments . The music is also good and the acting is far above Italian standards , with Gioia Scola ( Lucio Fulci's " Conquest ) , Urbano Barberini ( Dario Argento's " Opera " ) and especially David Brandon , the mean-looking actor from " Delirium " and " Caligola ? the Untold Story " . Recommended !
405200	2020269	44423	6.0	Compelling Gothic horror / drama	It's strange that I keep on discovering movies in which Boris Karloff actually plays the GOOD guy ! The man will always be an icon of horror-cinema , of course , but I used to think he exclusively portrayed monsters , mad scientists and psychopaths . Here in this forgotten 50's Goth epic , Karloff stars as the noble and honorable resident doctor of an Austrian castle community of which the owner ? Count Von Bruno ? is the only true sadist and murderer ! Sir Ronal Burton arrives at the castle to search for his two missing friends , of which he believes Von Bruno captured and killed them , and eventually relies on Karloff's character Meissen to save him . Von Bruno is a real villain who enjoys barbaric hunting games and holds an impressive collection of torture devices in his dungeon . Burton falls in love with his repressed wife Elga and when he's unmasked as Von Bruno's ancient nemesis , they're both locked up in the cellar . The script of " The Black Castle " is rather complex , but well constructed and rich on topics that fans of vintage Gothic cinema will certainly appreciate . The atmosphere in the extended hunting game sequences reminded me a bit of " The Most Dangerous Game " and the set pieces inside the castle looked genuinely sinister . There are more than enough sub plots and twisted supportive characters to keep the film compelling despite the lack of gruesome horror situations and make-up effects . The cast features another familiar horror face , Lon Chaney Jr . , but he and Karloff sadly don't get enough screen time to list " The Black Castle " among their most memorable achievements in acting . This was the debut feature of the respectable director Nathan Juran , who went on making fun & undemanding Sci-Fi / horror flicks like " The Deadly Mantis " , " 20 Million Miles to Earth " and " The Brain from Planet Arous " .
405166	2020269	70446	7.0	Have yourself a good old-fashioned , traditional and nightmarish Cajun wedding night !	I liked this gritty and harsh exploitation / revenge feature , and don't quite understand why it's so unknown and forgotten ( and the people who do know it don't even seem to like it ) . True , the script somewhat moves too slow and quite a few sequences easily could have been cut , but the main premise is fascinating , the two main characters are likable and the pivot scenes are often so full of tension you have any nails left to bite by the time they're finished . David and Jill couldn't be happier on their wedding day . Finally reunited after David spent two years in the hell of Vietnam and they even escaped Jill's family traditional wedding ritual where they " hunt " the newlyweds and hope to ruin their first night together . Whilst hiding in a sleazy Cajun motel , David and Jill witness the execution of a corrupt businessman by hired hit men . The crazed killers knock David KO and viciously rape Jill . After this tragedy they attempt to pick up their lives again , but Jill is an emotional wreck and David has exclusively set his mind on retribution . They embark on a search to find out the rapists identities , which leads them all the way to New Orleans . One of the great things about " Nightmare Honeymoon " ? in my humble opinion at least ? is that the character drawings are more realistic and identifiable . The reason why the film doesn't contain that much violent action or rancid sleaze is because Elliot Silverstein largely puts the emphasis on the series of emotions the newlyweds go through , together as well as separately . David becomes so increasingly obsessed with the idea of revenge , he's often frightening himself and Jill suddenly questions her marriage , her feelings and even her own femininity . The final confrontation with the deranged rapist Lee ( excellent performance by John Beck ) is rather overlong but atmospheric and you genuinely pray for the couple to walk out of the showdown alive . The performances are great with very convincing roles for Dack Rambo ( awesome name , dude ) as David and the cherubic Rebecca Dianna Smith as Jill . Elliot Silverstein's direction is tight and solid . He completed this little 70's gem in between directing his two most famous and much more publicly acclaimed achievements , namely the western drama ( and predecessor of " Dances with Wolves " ) " A Man Called Horse " and horror-favorite " The Car " , about a satanically possessed vehicle terrorizing the inhabitants of a small desert town .
404466	2020269	70556	7.0	Ain't no party like a hillbilly wedding party , Yee-Haaa !	A friend and I watched " Poor Pretty Eddie " on the big screen , during a film night special appropriately entitled Rednecksploitation . Let me tell you , along with the ramshackle cinema hangar & the poor quality of the original film spool , the story & atmosphere of this movie catapulted us straight back to the glorious highlight-years of rancid 70's drive-in grindhouse exploitation ! Movies like " Poor Pretty Eddie " will not and simply cannot be made anymore nowadays , because they're filthy , always discriminating to someone , rough , women-unfriendly and shameless . If someone made something like this today , groups of protesters would march outside the theaters until the owners have no other choice but to cancel the showings . Anyway , this fabulously entertaining film is shockingly perverse , hilarious and nightmarishly uncanny all at the same time . You've never encountered a bigger bunch of disturbed rednecks , not even in " Deliverance " or " Just before Dawn " , and the script covers even the most controversial themes , like racism and rape . Leslie Uggams portrays a popular ( and rather cocky ) whose car naturally breaks down at the wrong place at the wrong time . On her way to a vacation Liz Wetherly strands in Southern Redneck Hell , at a miserable motel owned by a faded showgirl ( now an obese and depressed old lady ) , a creepy-looking hunting dog lover and last but not least the wide-smirking & clearly deranged Elvis lunatic Eddie Collins . Eddie wants to keep her there , very much against the will of ol ' Bertha , and continuously tries to impress her with his questionable singing talents , big white smiling teeth and flamboyant outfits that reveal his muscles and massive amount of chest hair . When all friendly approaches fail , Eddie rapes Liz and forces her into marrying him . Needless to say she slowly & tragically starts losing her senses . This low-budget exploitation classic naturally thrives on atmosphere & demented character drawings instead of on convoluted plotting and special effects . The lead characters are wondrously twisted , but literally every single one of the supportive characters are remarkable as well , like the sleazy tomato-sucking sheriff ( the late grate Slim Pickens ) , his slingshot operating retard-sidekick and the perverse & fat-bellied judge / pool bar owner . Many of the crazed sequences in " Poor Pretty Eddie " literally need to be seen to be believed , for example the astonishingly tasteless montage of Liz ' rape interlarded with images of two dogs copulating in front of an assembly of seemingly aroused farmers and to the tunes of another great country song . The acting performances are great ; notably outstanding are Shelley Winters ( Oscar winner AND exploitation siren , respect ! ) , Ted Cassidy ( the original Addams Family's Lurch ) and of course Michael Christian as the titular not-so-poor and not-so-pretty Eddie . The climax sequence , set during an authentic and joyful hillbilly wedding party , is terrifically violent with slow-motion massacres and a total absence of sound . The film is overall poorly made , but several shots are surprisingly imaginative and the filming locations were definitely enchanting . " Poor Prettie Eddie " is most definitely a hidden gem . Sometimes falsely promoted as a Blaxploitation flick ( with an a . k . a title " Black Vengeance " ) and the cover image here on the website makes it look like an average Psycho-inspired slasher movie , in reality the film is a totally unique and unforgettable drive-in experience .
406134	2020269	780583	7.0	You'll wish it were just snakes on a plane !	This demented and adorably over-the-top gory zombie flick was presented and introduced here at the Belgian Horror & Fantasy Festival by its writer / creator Scott Thomas . He claims that , in spite of all the obvious plot-similarities with " Snakes on a Plane " , his film is definitely NOT a quick cash-in on the huge success of the 2006 summer-blockbuster and that the basic concept and the pre-production phase of " Plane Dead " actually predate " Snakes on a Plane " . Well , I don't know if all that is true , but I tend to believe Thomas because he's such a nice guy and he seemed very confident . Moreover , even if " Plane Dead " simply was a rip-off of the popular Sam L . Jackson hit , I still wouldn't care that much , because it's such a tremendously entertaining and enthusiast splatter-flick ! As long as you don't expect new and groundbreaking story lines and / or highly intellectual dialogs , " Plane Dead " honestly can't fail to amuse you . In most departments , it's even far better and more appealing to horror fanatics than " Snakes on a Plane " , because it's a lot faster , cheesier , gorier and shamelessly features all the standard clichés us genre fans love so much . Safely protected in the cargo-hold of the red-eye flight from L . A . to Paris , a mysterious scientific experiment is transported out of the US by its malicious creators . The unscrupulous Dr . Leo Bennett and his loyal researchers developed a virus that rapidly destroys human DNA , only to revive the infected victim again as a bloodthirsty and unstoppable zombie . He plans to sell his formula to the military in order to create the ultimate soldier , of course , but some unanticipated turbulence and noisy passengers on the 747-flight cause the female " test-case " zombie to resurrect a little early , and she immediately begins to feast her way through crew and passengers . Once bitten , the victim turns into a zombie as well , and pretty soon the plane is overrun by seemingly more zombies than there were passengers in the first place . It perhaps takes slightly too long before the zombies run loose on the plane , but when they do " Plane Dead " turns into a non-stop series of laughs , creative deaths and extreme gore . Apparently , only stereotypes were allowed aboard this flight and it's always a lot of fun to watch those getting killed off one by one . Naturally it's the elderly pilot's last flight before retirement , there's the heroic copper ? who eventually has to save the day - transporting a witty criminal , arguing teen couples , sexy yet empty-headed stewardesses , couples with marriage issues and Tiger Woods ' biggest competitor himself ! The gore is guaranteed to please people , as the script features several ingenious new methods to kill zombies , like an umbrella through the head , nine-iron golf clubs and of course airplane engines . Be honest , what would you rather get face-to-face with whilst stuck in an inescapable location : ordinary snakes , albeit a little venomous . . . or filthy , virulent , ravenous and outrageous zombies ? There are quite a few recognizable faces in the cast , like Kevin J . O'Connor ( the creep from " Lord of Illusions " and " Deep Rising " ) , Erick Avari and Richard Tyson . The lines and characters are often very funny , the make-up effects are delightfully campy in an old-fashioned way and there even is an occasional moment of genuine suspense . " Plane Dead " is awesome horror-entertainment and I hope Scott Thomas will enjoy the success he deserves with it .
406575	2020269	91539	7.0	God is not watching us . . .	Whenever you finish watching a film , any film , it is extremely important to sit back and contemplate for a moment about what you've learned from this particular viewing experience . " Convent of Sinners " taught me quite a few things , actually . For example , nuns don't wear any underwear but some kind of easily removable diapers . Nuns apparently also never wash their hair , as they don't take off their caps when bathing . Nuns laugh , tease and make fun of each other naked in the washing rooms , exactly like college frat girls do . During the period of the Inquisition , convents kept around a mute caretaker who always walks around shirtless and the nuns insisted on washing him themselves . And the most important valuable life lesson taught here is : do not EVER get in trouble with an insane lesbian second-in-command nun , because she'll accuse you of satanic possession and ruin your life ! Despite my slightly cynical tone , I must admit I enjoyed " Convent of Sinners " quite a lot and I was honestly surprised about how stylish and un-exploitative it actually was . Especially considering the man in charge was Joe D'Amato , who has a gazillion of adult movies on his repertoire as well as a handful of crazed horror / porn hybrids like " Erotic Nights of the Living Dead " and " Caligula : The Untold Story " , but this rare & obscure ' nunsploitation ' movie is fairly atmospheric and effectively attacking the Catholic Church's hypocrite & corrupt position back in the Inquisition era . The plot follows on the saddening life-story of a young and beautiful girl named Suzanna . The film opens with the brutal & explicit scene depicting Suzanna getting raped by her stepfather . Unfair as life is , she's the one punished for the committed sins , and she's sent to a convent and forced to serve God as a nun . Suzanna's natural beauty and friendly charisma rapidly cause the Mother Superior , as well as the resident young priest , to fall in love with her . But Mother Superior is terminally ill and the convent's second-in-command nun , sister Theresa , is a jealous battle-ax who'll do everything to destroy Suzanna's life ; even accuse her of worshiping the devil . " Convent of Sinners " is supposedly inspired by a classic novel and , it has to be said , the script is astonishingly coherent and well written . Particularly the last half hour is intense , with a witchcraft trial and a truly unforgettable exorcism-sequence in which our poor girl gets a holy water enema . Eva Grimaldi is very impressive ( and stunningly beautiful ) as Suzanna and the rest of the rest of the convent sisters do very adequate jobs as well . The climax sequence is phenomenal and very saddening at the same time . This is easily one of Joe D'Amato's finest accomplishments . It's thought-provoking , involving and even a slight bit historically accurate .
405452	2020269	65553	7.0	Swinging Bava !	Mario Bava himself repeatedly stated that this is the worst film he was ever involved in , so luckily enough there still are some loyal and naive fan-boys ( like myself ) to reassure the public that " 5 Dolls for an August Moon " nonetheless remains a worthy purchase and definitely better than your average horror / mystery from the early 70's . Even though this giallo can't possibly reach the brilliance-level of nearly every other Bava film ( the list is enormous , with " Black Sabbath , Kill Baby ? Kill " , " Blood and Black Lace , " Black Sunday " ? ) , it's a light-headed and often ingenious effort . The plot is a very simple variation on Agatha Christie's " Ten Little Indians " , set on an island inhabited by rich and utterly greedy bastards . The island's owner , George Stark , invited a bunch of businessmen and their wives over for a weekend of million-dollar-deals and adultery . One of the guests invented a groundbreaking formula ( something about resin ) and the others make it a sport to bid the most money for it . They aren't even ashamed to throw in their sexy wives as an extra . The party really gets interesting once the invitees ' bodies turn up brutally murdered one by one . " 5 Dolls for an August Moon " indeed looks more like a satire instead of a suspenseful giallo and it's obvious that Bava didn't put much devotion into it . The murders are mainly committed off screen but the emphasis lies on the comical storage of the cadavers , namely in a meat-locker and clumsily wrapped in plastics . The dialogs are weak yet almost the entire film is foreseen of a jazzy soundtrack , which actually makes " 5 Dolls for an August Moon " Bava's most swinging horror movie ( the über-cool " Danger : Diabolik " is falls into a class of its own ) . The totally unpredictable twist at the end is fantastic , in my opinion . The cast is more than interesting , particularly because the unearthly beautiful Edwige Fenech hops around in bikinis and lingerie most of the time . She's a good actress , but she's even a better nude model . For just this one time , don't listen to the master-director himself and watch this film ! You won't regret it , especially not if you miss the typical tastelessness of the 70's .
405251	2020269	289879	7.0	Good film , surprisingly raw and obscure !	Although the twisted premise of " The Butterfly Effect " definitely sounded like my cup of tea , I was reluctant to go and see it right away , simply because I feared that the film would revolve too much on the popular teen-idol Aston Kutcher and also because it was very likely that sentiment and feel-good twists would overrule the obscurity of the basic story . Well , I'm happy to admit that I was totally wrong ( happens quite often ) and that " The Butterfly Effect " is , in fact , a powerful and honest thriller . Unlike other nowadays so-called thrillers that star popular names , the directors of this film are not afraid to add despair and in-your-face shocks , which makes it an involving and often unsettling cinema effort . Kutcher , these days better known as Demi Moore's toy-boy , also proves himself to be a fairly strong actor , capable of showing a wide range of emotions . He stars as Evan , an adolescent who suffers from severe blackouts every time he faces a trauma or difficult moment . He learns that , through these blackouts , he can cause a time warp and travel back to his childhood years when he and his circle of friends made some horrible , future-defining mistakes . He can then alter the past for everyone involved , which makes the film feel like a amalgamation of " Stand By Me " and " Time Cop " . This mood-setting introduction is already quite good , with nice character developing and some hard sequences ( Eric Stoltz in his vicious basement ! ) but the film even gets better when it seems that every time-travel goes horribly wrong . The moral of the story thus is that life can never be satisfying for everybody at once and that certain sacrifices eventually seems inevitable . You know that you've been watching a good film when you and the people you've seen it with are still discussing the story ( and more particularly , the climax ) hours after finishing it . " The Butterfly Effect " is such a film .
404541	2020269	492912	7.0	It's Alive ! ! It's Alive ! ! ! . . . x50 !	Two young men , isolated up in the mountains , performing bizarre and questionable experiments on each other ? No , it isn't an early sequel to " Brokeback Mountain " but a new & clever independent horror film that I hope will be regarded as a minor cult gem within a couple of years ! The screenplay of " Subject Two " is based on Mary Shelley's almighty " Frankenstein " - tale in which an intelligent but overly obsessed scientist brings back an unwilling victim from the dead . Only , times have severely changed by now and , instead of lightening storms or voodoo rituals , science now uses Nano-technologies , cloning techniques and loads of other hi-tech stuff I totally didn't understand ! Dr . Franklin Vick ( got it ? Victor Frankenstein ? Yeah OK , you get it ? ) lures the anti-social medical student Adam to his remote mountain cabin where he kills him repeatedly ? but successfully brings him back to life every single time . These intense experiments have a severe impact on Adam , of course , and pretty soon he turns into an emotional and physical wreck . This film contains multiple praiseworthy elements that I haven't spotted in other , high-budgeted horror productions in a very long time already . First and foremost , there's the hugely original Aspen , Colorado filming location ! The total lack of civilization and the false hope for rescue is perfectly illustrated by the snowy mountains and unbearably cold winds . The limited number of cast members contributes a lot to the power of " Subject Two " as well , also because the male leads give away great performances . Dean Stapleton ( who tremendously resemblances Jack Nicholson when he was younger ) is genuinely sinister as the doc and Christian Oliver is very convincing as the mentally unstable guinea pig . This isn't exactly a full-blooded horror film , but there's quite a bit of gore and raw violence on display . The dialogs are witty and ? entirely unexpected ? the plot takes an ingenious turn near the end ! Just for that , " Subject Two " receives one well-deserved extra point . If you have the opportunity to see this smart film by Philip Chidel , don't hesitate !
405144	2020269	65720	7.0	Fascinating , but can't explain why . . .	" Figures in a Landscape " is definitely one of the weirdest and most unclassifiable movies I've encountered lately , and at the same time it's pretty difficult to explain why that is . Some movies are weird because they increasingly overpower the viewer with substantial twists and / or stylistic gimmicks , but still they constantly uphold the impression there's some kind of deeper meaning or hidden structure behind it . The films of David Lynch are like that , for example . Other movies , and " Figures in a Landscape " is definitely one of them , are weird because they never at one point feature abrupt story twists and never even seem to want to achieve a deeper meaning . Kind of like the ' what you see is what you get principle ' and don't even bother asking background information . Based on Barry England's novel - that probably only very few people have read - " Figures in a Landscape " revolves on two escaped convicts nervously running across a desolate area . Pretty much like the title implies , they are , in fact , simply figures in a landscape . We're never explained where exactly the events take place ( South America ? East Asia ? ) or what crimes the two committed in the first place . They must have been quite serious , however , as MacConnachie and Ansell quickly find themselves besieged by a menacing black helicopter and later also by army patrols on foot . The helicopter plays a devastating mental and physical game with them , as it appears to be omnipresent and in absolutely no hurry to pick them up . This is the type of film where there are no characters to root for . You won't develop any sympathy for the fugitives as they commit some truly vile acts along their way and you can't really support the guys inside the helicopter , neither , as their faces aren't even properly shown . " Figures in a Landscape " is a brooding , moody and mildly unsettling film that doesn't always makes sense and doesn't bother to involve the viewer . But , if you manage to put all the unanswered questions aside from you , this also might turn out one extremely enchanting viewing experience . Every shot , every inch of the landscape seems precisely measured and re-considered at least a dozen times before featuring in the film . The choreography is simply wonderful and the filming locations ? apparently Spanish ? are almost continuously breathtaking . The performances of Robert Shaw and Malcolm McDowell couldn't be more apt and Joseph Losey's direction is very surefooted . After seeing only this and the even more unique " These are the Doomed " , I'm more than anxious to check out Losey's further repertoire .
404496	2020269	56983	7.0	" The Haunted and the Hunted "	" The Haunted and the Hunted " is an appropriate and much more meaningful a . k . a for Coppola's sublime debut , focusing on a cursed and tormented Irish family . The plot is grim and creative and seemly starts out as a psychological portrait about a family reuniting in the parental castle to have a memorial ceremony in honor of the deceased daughter . The girl drowned in the estate's pond 7 years before and the mother still can't deal with the loss . But then the story pretty quickly turns into a guessing game of " who is the mad axe-murderer who dwells around the mansion ? " Coppola himself delivered a well-constructed screenplay but the power of this film merely lies in the solid Gothic atmosphere instead of ingenious plotting . It's not that hard to guess the homicidal maniac's identity but the butchering he / she commits is disturbingly filmed and rather frightening . The scene in which this killer drags one of his victims through the meadow is efficiently eerie ! Francis Ford Coppola's maybe owes his success to Roger Corman but it's definitely the producer's style and trademarks that triumph here . The depressing Irish castle and other dark set pieces make the wholesome look extra chilling and uncanny . The acting is overall decent but the best performance is unquestionably given by the brilliant British genre-actor Patrick Magee ( Asylum , Tales from the crypt and A Clockwork Orange ) .
405943	2020269	82951	7.0	On the prowl . . . with Tom Savini	Like a true horrorfreak , I get a kick out of hunting down all the films for which Tom Savini did the make-up . ' Friday the 13th ' and ' Dawn of the Dead ' are the obvious ones , but the real treats can be found in the overlooked early 80's slasher section . ' Maniac ' and ' Nightmare in a Damaged Brain ' are perfect examples and so is this little gruesome tale . The Prowler doesn't outshine the mainstream horror movies when it comes to plot , characters or twists ? but it does show some nauseating and hard to digest sequences . The film also has a pretty atmospheric and mood-setting opening . We learn how young WWII soldiers return to the US after the war . One of them finds a letter of his high-school sweetheart upon his arrival in which she's dumping him . During the Graduation celebration of her school , the girl ( Rosemary ) and her new boyfriend are brutally slaughtered by pitchfork . 35 years later , the town finally decides to organize a new school-dance . Unfortunately , this event also causes the return of the army-uniformed madman . The characters aren't exactly intriguing and the climax is far from surprising , but the brutality of the killings is definitely worth it . We're even treated to lovely head-explosion that lives up to the one in Maniac . Thank you Tom Savini ! Compared with the overload of polite and ethically correct ( read = boring ) slashers , the Prowler looks fresh and very entertaining . Director Joseph Zito also signed for one of the better F13 sequels as well as a few over-the-top Chuck Norris action flicks . I took me quite some time to finally find The Prowler and I feel no shame in recommending it to real horror fans . If you can't stand blood or in case you have a sensitive throat , this film will not leave a good impression behind . Otherwise ? enjoy !
405206	2020269	83336	7.0	Sharp teeth and an intelligent screenplay !	Wolfen ? not wolves , like a terrifically spiritual Edward James Olmos explains it to us ? is a truly inspired and solid horror film that belongs to the best genre-achievements of the 80's . Terrifically set in the pauperized wastelands of New York , where an ancient terror unconquerably reigns . Only when someone of political importance vanishes in these suburbs , attention is drawn and an investigation is started . Albert Finney is well cast as the confused police officer who slowly has to face the fact that the murders in his district are committed by inhumanly strong forces , more and more resembling to animal attacks . The script of Wolfen ( based on Whitley Strieber's novel ) is a compelling one and it's filled with original and imaginative ideas containing spiritual motivations and even historical elements . A basic script like that , accompanied by a stunning photography and convincing acting can only result in a terrific , overlooked horror classic . Two thumbs up for this film ! Director Wadleigh even satisfied the more mainstream horror fans as his film includes a couple of bloody killing sequences and a constant frightening tone . Finney and Edward James Olmos are the most impressive cast members , yet they receive good feedback from Tom Noonan ( in one of his earliest roles ) , Gregory Hines ( I don't believe I ever saw him in a horror film before ) and Diane Verona . Fans of action-packed werewolf film may face a disappointment when purchasing this film , but all other open-minded cinema audiences are in for a really pleasant surprise . Wolfen is highly recommended and thought-provoking entertainment !
406084	2020269	74523	7.0	He Sucks his own C ? ! ! !	What's the first thing on any man's mind when he's freshly released from prison ? Sex , of course ! But what about the second , and third , and fourth ? Most people would say a decent meal or a proper job , but in the case of ultimately perverted freak Rocky De Sade it's exclusively sex ; the sicker the better . Alex de Renzy's " Femmes de Sade " is somewhat of a masterpiece in its own secluded and often neglected category . It's a rough and brutal 70's porn / horror movie with an adequate storyline , decent character drawings and sadistic hardcore material . Rocky ( his last name is of course a fabulous homage to the legendary infamous marquis ) walks out of the prison gates , promptly invites himself to the house of a fellow inmate and barbarically rapes his girlfriend . He then immediately dives into the big city's nightlife , looking for more prostitutes to satisfy his sexual hunger and oppressed appetite for violence . The impressively postured and sick-spirited ex-con physically and mentally abuses a whole series of girls , until they combine forces and plot a vile & humiliating payback during a private orgy party . The film's powerful impact principally relies on Ken Turner's deranged performance as Rocky . This guy almost naturally radiates pure maliciousness & emotional nihilism , and he's literally as big as a house ! And very flexible , too , as demonstrated during the jaw-dropping scene in which he orally " pleasures " himself and uncannily forces a girl to do the same . There's a parallel storyline , admittedly just to stretch the running time a little , about an adult video store clerk fantasizing about the all the women that pass by his store . The finale is short but sweet , and you should truly prepare yourself to witness a LOT of filth , including bestiality , urinal sex and even scat . Demented 70's smut , highly recommend to all you sick puppies out there .
405048	2020269	74740	7.0	Djangoooooooo ! I mean , . . . KEOMAAAAAAAA !	Sublimely paced and spectacular spaghetti western , albeit mildly unoriginal and a little too much relying on the powerful charisma of veteran gunslinger-hero Franco Nero . Precisely as in " Django " , the Italian western classic that made him legendary , Nero stars as a silent and rather introvert hero who single-handedly exterminates entire gangs of baddies without even tiring himself . Keoma is a half-breed ( partly Indian ) who spent the last several years fighting in the Civil War and immediately rescues a beautiful pregnant lady upon the return to his hometown . He'll have to battle the new malicious ruler in town , Caldwell , who carelessly exiled all victims of the plague epidemic , as well as his own 3 jealous and power mad half-brothers , who betrayed their father and joined Caldwell's troops . The most glorious years of spaghetti-westerns were as good as over by the time Enzo G . Castellari made " Keoma " , but this is another old-fashioned and adrenalin-rushing installment containing all the delicious ingredients cult-fanatics adore so much . There's a minimum of dialogs but a gigantic amount of virulent gunfights , beautiful widescreen cinematography , an absolutely staggering soundtrack and loads of macho fist-fights . On top of that , " Keoma " also upholds an strangely sinister atmosphere with strange ? but stylish ? flashbacks and oddly developing relationships between the different characters . The film's first hour moves slow and director Castellari puts a lot of time into extendedly introducing even the supportive characters characters , like Keoma's beloved father and his black mentor / former slave George . However , once the final battle begins , the action doesn't stop for 30 minutes straight and masterfully builds up towards an excruciatingly intense and severely unhappy ending . The many elegant slow-motion shots and extra saddening singing voices even increase the tension and I guarantee you'll be sitting on the edge of the seat . Many people seem to complain about the unusual use of music in " Keoma " ( idem in the case of Sergio Martino's " Mannaja " ) , but I honestly thought the peculiarly sung tunes were brilliant and very appropriate .
404830	2020269	57226	7.0	Fangs Wide Shut	I can't help it , but the most fundamental pivot sequences in " Kiss of the Vampire " somewhat reminded me of Stanley Kubrick's much more recent " Eyes Wide Shut " . The story of this shamefully underrated Hammer effort revolves on young newlyweds Gerald and Marianne who are slowly lured into a highly secluded society of bloodthirsty vampires , led by the prominent Dr . Ravna and his charming offspring . Critical turning points in the script , like the masked ball and the subsequent gathering of the society members for Marianne's initiation ceremony , looked so very familiar to the psychedelic scenes in " Eyes Wide Shut " ! As if Kubrick tried hard to capture the atmospheric mood of this modest little UK horror film and transfer it to his own widely acclaimed final feature as a director . It probably never was anyone's intention to link these two movies , but it might be something fun to look out for during your next viewing . Anyway , that being said , " Kiss of the Vampire " is an exceptionally beautiful Hammer accomplishment and it urgently deserves a little more appreciation from all us fans of classic horror . It may lack the star-power ( unfortunately ) of Christopher Lee or Peter Cushing , but the photography and use of scenery are often superb and these aspects also definitely compensate for the occasional dull moment in the script . The opening sequence perhaps ranks amongst the absolute most powerful Hammer-moments ever , showing a young girl's funeral getting brutally interrupted by her own drunk father who plunges a shovel through the coffin and hereby prevents her from rising again as an undead . Although dealing with vampires , you totally don't see this twist coming and it's effectively shocking . The climax as well is incredibly ingenious , although it caused a delay a for the film's release since distributors feared it would be too reminiscent to Alfred Hitchcock's " The Birds " . Talk about underrated , Don Sharp directs with a whole lot of flair and Alan Hume's camera-work is downright breathtaking .
405265	2020269	94701	7.0	Very good thriller with loads of blood ( small spoilers )	Originality isn't really Bad Dreams ' biggest trump but it sure is an ideal film in case you're looking for a few scares and / or chilling entertainment . The plot involves a spiritual sect with a textbook leader type that performed a mass suicide ritual in the 70's . One girl survived and she awakes from her coma 13 years later . Immediately after , she's haunted by hallucinations and nightmares in which the leader returns comes to tell her she has to fulfill her promise to the group and commit suicide after all . When she refuses , the leader leads other victims into death and he easily finds them among the psychiatric patients of the hospital . As stated earlier , the plot of Bad Dreams isn't very unique and borrows elements from over a dozen other ( horror ) movies . Mostly from ' Nightmare on Elm Street 3 : Dream Warriors ' ( the image of the horribly burned leader even resembles the Freddy Kruger pizza-face ! ) and the group session looks inspired by ' One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest ' . But who cares ? Very few movies are completely original and at least this film offers spectacular amusement . Andrew Fleming's Bad Dreams upholds a good tempo , it has a great soundtrack ( including a demented version of ' My Way ' and a Guns ' n Roses classic during the end credits ) and there's enough blood and gore to satisfy the most demanding horror buff . We see how people are getting burned , stabbed or thrown from high buildings . Two poor bastards even get hacked up in a ventilation system ! Is that bloody enough for you ? And yes , at some points , Fleming even succeeds in creating tension and eeriness . Especially the sequence where Cynthia has her first hallucination in the broken elevator is memorable . Last but not least Bad Dreams has a terrific B-movie cast filled with familiar faces . Jennifer Rubin plays the lead and she suffered from the same issues before in Nightmare on Elm Street . Bruce Abbott stars as a dedicated shrink and you'll unquestionably recognize him from the one and only Re-Animator . There also are neat supportive roles for Dean Cameron ( Summer School ) , Harris Yulin ( Scarface , 24 ) and even the lovely singer E . G . Daily makes an appearance ! I say you better ignore the unusually large amount of negative reviews and give this one a look .
406525	2020269	94713	7.0	Where the hell is Lassie when you need him ?	Bizarre but truly original French thriller / black comedy that is strangely scary and disturbing even though you damn well know that the premise is pure and far-fetched fiction . The titular ' character ' is a cool-looking bull terrier whose thoughts and impressions we follow throughout the entire movie . Baxter's life isn't very easy , as he keeps ending up with the wrong guardians . At first , he's given as a present to an elderly lady who clearly fears him and doesn't really want him in her house . When the lady dies under ' mysterious circumstances ' , Baxter is donated to the young and cheerful couple that lives on the other side of the street . For quite a while , everything goes well and Baxter is really happy in his new family ? Until the couple's first baby is born . Baxter doesn't understand why he receives no more attention all of a sudden and sees the infant as a real threat for his own happiness . Baxter's final guardian is a lonely and introvert 11-year-old boy who teaches him tricks and commands . The kid has a dangerous interest in Hitler's persona , however , and he slowly turns Baxter into an aggressive killing machine . It may sound unbelievable , but I assure you it's very unsettling to hear a DOG hatching plots to kill people ! Although there's absolutely no violence shown on screen , there are some very macabre things going on in this film and the atmosphere is almost unbearably tense . During several of Baxter's twisted monologues , you wonder what exactly goes on in the mind of man's best friend . We can all assume that our pets love us unconditionally , but who says they're not plotting to get rid of us ? Also one of the reasons why Baxter comes across so spooky is because he talks through a very grim and monotonous voice . The actor who's credited as Baxter's voice ? Maxime Leroux ? would sure do a great job as a host of horror anthologies , or something . I particularly loved the climax of this ingenious French film . It shows that , no matter how egocentric and mean the dog is , it'll always be the human mind that is the most deranged ? even when it's a child . Don't expect a happy ending here ! Highly recommended ! !
405158	2020269	90293	7.0	Warning : objects in your DVD-player are SCARIER than they appear !	" Warning Sign " looks like another ordinary and routine 80's horror / Sci-Fi movie , but actually it's quite a lot better than that ! The professionally written screenplay , realistic make-up effects and stellar performances from a great cast make this one of the most underrated " science-projects-gone-bad " films ever and it's a damn shame that I only found out about it now . The basic idea behind this movie , which involves the development of secret government bio-weapon that turns random people into aggressive maniacs , is rather disturbing and not even that unthinkable if you follow the movie carefully . Strategically located in rural Utah , there's a hi-tech institute of which the people think it improves national agriculture techniques . The institute's real purpose ? biological warfare ? only becomes clear when a serious accident occurs and the whole place is hermetically sealed . The employees that are trapped inside all slowly transform into zombie-like monsters , except for one ( the local sheriff's wife ) , and her immunity becomes the only hope for rescue . This fast-paced Sci-Fi thriller offers plenty of genuine suspense and the make-up effects never go over the top , unlike in the majority of other 80's paranoid government conspiracy movies . The fear and despair of the people trapped inside the institute is very well captured and the atmosphere outside the building is even more intense . Sam Waterston , Kathleen Quinlan and Jeffrey DeMunn are all great in their leading roles and there are excellent supportive roles for Richard Dysart , Yaphet Kotto and G . W . Bailey . Although not a very experienced filmmaker , Hal Barwood's directing is surefooted and impressive . The climax should have been more exciting , though . Now the " happy ending " feels a bit too forced and implausible .
405532	2020269	131449	7.0	Never been kissed ? . . . Keep it that way .	Susan , the young daughter of a hard-working mortician , has a strange passion for giant spiders , more particularly tarantulas , and engages her hairy friends to get rid of unpleasant persons in her life , like her own mother who plotted to kill her father anyway . By the time she's an attractive teenager , her passion turned into an obsession and it becomes all the more easier to find victims for the " kiss " of her tarantulas . This is a fairy enjoyable spider-feature , especially in case you like 70's drive-in horror . It's quite creepy , too ! As long as you've got a bunch of spiders , you don't really need any other form of special effects as these icky critters provide the film with more than enough genuine frights . Unfortunately , there's very little coherence in the script and all the main events seem be juxtaposed without much connection between them . Also , as the story develops , the Susan-character shows more an more resemblance with Stephen King's " Carrie " . She gets emotionally unstable , uncertain about herself , seemly all alone against the rest of the world and ? of course ? disposing of unique powers . Much like the 1978 movie " Jennifer " was a Carrie rip-off with snakes , " Kiss of the Tarantula " is a well-disguised Carrie rip-off with . . . duh . . . tarantulas ! But then and completely unexpected , the story takes another few twists that don't involve tarantulas at all , and " Kiss of the Tarantula " once again becomes a one-of-a-kind 70's shocker . The ending is downright fantastic ! This movie may not be flawless but it sure is creative .
404343	2020269	1418824	7.0	Ambitious Italian thriller with obvious Giallo echoes	The era of illustriousness for the Italian Gialli movies is long over and gone ? more than twenty years already , in fact ? but ambitious Italian filmmakers occasionally still breeze in to deliver new movies with plenty of echoes to this wondrous sub genre of European horror / thriller cinema . Some fine recent examples of this include " The Unknown Woman " , " Eyes of Crystal " and " The Girl by the Lake " . Luigi Cecinelli's " Visions " arguably also ranks high amongst these chosen few , although the parallelism between this film and the authentic Gialli of the early 70's is much more subtle and indistinct . Giallo-obsessed freaks , like myself , will undoubtedly spot the likenesses , but to the majority of normal film-loving audiences " Visions " will probably just comes across as a convoluted but solid , suspenseful and very engaging psychological thriller . Andrea Del Monte's script is perhaps slightly over-ambitious and pseudo-intellectual for its own good , resulting into a confusing and improbable finale , but some of the basic plot-ingredients and ideas are deeply impressive . And even though director Cecinelli and writer Del Monte are relatively inexperienced , " Visions " is also a skilfully stylish , coherently structured and adequately shot accomplishment . The opening ten minutes are unquestionably the best and most memorable ones , as they cover the latest onslaught of the smart and seemingly unstoppable serial killer known as " The Spider " . In an attempt to rescue several of his captured victims at once , the entire police squad as well as the hostages die an excruciatingly painful death . The traumatized FBI-profiler Dr . Leeman resigns and returns to his previous job ; psychiatrist in a private clinic . A certain time later one of his patients , Matt ? an amnesia patient recovering from a car accident ? accidentally stumbles upon Dr . Leeman's notes and records on The Spider's case and begins to suffer from nightmarish visions that are accurately illustrating the infamous serial killer's deeds . Suspecting some kind of psychic or perhaps even physical link with The Spider , Matt digs deeper into the case , in assistance with a fellow patient , a sexy journalist and eventually even Dr . Leeman himself . " Visions " may seem predictable and fairly obvious straight from the beginning , but there's a lot more than superficially meeting the eye . It's a puzzle gradually getting more difficult to solve with each piece that falls into place and you only comprehend the complete picture when the entire puzzle is solved . Your initial guess regarding the denouement might be correct , but nonetheless there are several twist and turns throughout the film that are simply too complex to predict . I realize this all sounds extremely vague and maybe even bit misleading , but it honestly would be a shame to reveal anything more and risk spoiling a potentially surprising viewing experience . Try and think of " Visions " like some sort of odd but unexpectedly effective crossbreed of " Saw " and " The Usual Suspects " . The special effects are top-class and overwhelming , even a tad bit exaggerated sometimes , and there are a handful of moments of grisly violence . Hopefully this clever and zealous Italian production receives a proper distribution , as it deserves a wide audience .
405627	2020269	105690	7.0	Bad Guys Galore !	I remember , mostly back when it got released but even still now , dull critics and sour people in general simply categorized " Under Siege " as a lousy and uninspired version of " Die Hard " on a battleship instead of atop a skyscraper . Okay , this may very well be the most apt description imaginable , but that doesn't mean this movie can't awesome popcorn entertainment ! I usually restrain from writing about anything that isn't horror or cult cinema , but I gladly make exceptions for action flicks if they A ) are extremely violent and / or B ) feature highly memorable villainous characters . These two factors happen to be very well-presented in " Under Siege " . There's an enormous body count throughout the entire movie and the bad guys ? well ? they are simply what makes this film so darn enjoyable . I've never really been a fan of Steven Seagal and agree that if his role were to be played by Bruce Willis or perhaps even Sylvester Stallone the film could even be better , but it doesn't really matter all that much thanks to Colm Meaney , Gary Busey and Tommy Lee Jones . Particularly Busey as the treacherous and psychopathic commander and Jones as dangerously demented former special agent are so terrific that you'll often even forget Seagal wanders around the ship somewhere as well . A lot of mariners are gathered on the USS Missouri to attend a Pearl Harbour memorial but mostly to participate in the captain's birthday party afterwards . The ideal opportunity for greedy Cmdr . Krill ( Busey ) and a troop of mercenaries led by William Stranix to hijack the battleship and toy around with its huge arsenal of nuclear weaponry . One thing they didn't take into account , however , is the presence of the Captain's personal friend and acclaimed chef Casey Ryback . Ryback never really liked Krill ? maybe because the latter spat in his bouillabaisse ? ? and with his secret Navy SEAL past , the terrorists are up against an opponent much tougher than they bargained for . Exactly like it was the case in the aforementioned " Die Hard " , " Under Siege " benefits mostly from its claustrophobic and nearly inescapable setting . Director Andrew Davis admirably makes great use of the ship's dark interiors and ominous mechanical chambers by having his characters stroll around endlessly with their guns ready to fire away . This is definitely Steven Seagal's best film and it would have even been better if his character was a deaf-mute , or something ! His corny one-liners are terrible , but luckily he's often accompanied by the ravishing Baywatch babe Erika Eleniak ( who also treats us to a totally gratuitous but oh-so-welcome boobs shot ) or one of the baddies . Actually , I can't even be sure if this is Seagal's best film as I still haven't seen the majority of his not-so-impressive repertoire . I sincerely doubt , however , that straight-to-video productions like " Belly of the Beast " and " Urban Justice " can be any better than this modest action hit of the glorious early 90's .
404548	2020269	71150	7.0	God is not available at the moment . . . but Lucifer will gladly possess you !	After one failing attempt approximately a year ago , I really wanted to give this movie another chance , if it were only to struggle beyond those confusing and headache-inducing opening five minutes this time . If you consider watching " The Antichrist " , bear in mind that the intro is extremely hectic and unappealing but the movie quickly improves after that . We open at some sort of pilgrimage location where a Holy Mary statue supposedly cures crippled people and where a man possessed by demons jumps off a cliff . This introduction is overlong and the photography is really ugly . After that , however , we're more properly introduced to the female lead character . Ippolita is bound to a wheelchair since a car accident at the age of twelve and her lonely existence causes her to lose all faith in God . She becomes an easy target for Satan to possess her body & soul , especially when she also turns out to be the reincarnation of a 16th Century witch that was burned at the stake ( hypnosis brought that up ) . Overnight , Ippolita transforms into a Satan-puppet who seduces young schoolboys and dreams about wild sex with a guy in a goat mask who feeds her toad heads ! Her loving father , brother and priest uncle do whatever they can to save poor Ippolita's soul , but the Devil within her is strong and not at all planning to leave without a ' good vs . evil ' battle . Another reviewer righteously pointed out already that it's way too easy to label " The Antichrist " as being just another Italian " The Exorcist " rip off . It only turns into a shameless imitation halfway through the story , when Ippolita moves furniture with her mind and says naughty things similar to the lines Linda Blair driveled in " The Exorcist " . The least we can do is refer to this exploitation gem as a " Rip-Off DeLuxe " , as Alberto De Martino really bothered to add new ideas and even a couple of very interesting sub plots , such as the incestuous relationship between Ippolita and her brother and the alternative voodoo-treatment by a sleazy-looking religion guru . There are quite a few redundant sequences and the slow pacing often gets on your nerves but " The Antichrist " really isn't such a bad film overall . The only truly embarrassing moments occur when the film tries to look EXACTLY like " The Exorcist " , with green vomit and rotating heads etc ? Compensating for these flaws are a cool soundtrack , fairly adequate performances and a handful of stylish scenes near the middle of the film . Particularly the orgy-hallucination is hauntingly beautiful and more fascinating than any random sequence in William Friendkin's " The Exorcist " .
406379	2020269	114194	7.0	The Army of Angels is all here . . . But where's God when you need him ?	" The Prophecy " is one of the better and undoubtedly one of the most ambitiously plotted horror movies of the 1990's . In a decade where most horror movies were mere uninspired imitations and / or sequels in franchises that already outstayed their welcome , writer / director Gregory Widen ( co-creator of the original " Highlander " ) comes up with a uniquely original and complex religious thriller dealing with fallen angels , the Second War in heaven , soul-sucking , angel autopsies and former priests turned cop slowly regaining the lost faith . The atmosphere of the film is pitch black and sinister and , even though there are copious opportunities to revert to a " simple " occult horror movie with a lot of gory killings and nasty images , Widen always makes sure the emphasis remains on coherent storytelling and characterizations . When inspector Thomas Daggett is called to the morgue to look at a super-human corpse , little does he know he's about to become involved in the greatest spiritual showdown in history . The Second War of Heaven has moved down to earth , with the ultra-malignant ( but über-cool ) fallen archangel Gabriel hunting down the evil soul of a deceased war criminal . If he takes possession of this soul , Gabriel is destined to win the battle upstairs , so the " good " angel Simon tries to prevent this by hiding the soul elsewhere . The plot , albeit obviously very fantastic and far-fetched , is intriguing and there are enough twists to keep you alert at all times . The character drawings are detailed and very well done , as you feel like you know enough about the evil characters as well as the good ones . Most amusing aspects about " The Prophecy " , however , are the really ingenious parts / gimmicks of the screenplay that aren't even that essential to the main story lines . For example , Gabriel requires a human assistant to drive him around and stuff , and for this job he uses suicide victims that are about to step into the light . This often leads to very funny situations . Another highlight is the appearance of no one less than Lucifer himself near the end of the movie . You see , there are a whole lot of angels ? good or bad ? present here ; the only party guest missing is God himself . The cast is overall splendid with terrific roles for Elias Koteas , Virginia Madsen , Eric Stoltz , Adam Goldberg and Viggo Mortensen . The absolute star of the entire " Prophecy " franchise , and especially this first and superior installment in particular , naturally is Christopher Walken . He's stupendous as Gabriel and continuously balances between blackly comical and genuinely petrifying . Walken is probably one of the only actors who can make you laugh and shiver with fear at the same time . Some of his one-liners here are simply priceless . Example ; when someone condemns him to hell , he arrogantly replies with " It's heaven ? The least you could do is getting the zip-code right " . Followed by two inferior sequels also starring Christopher Walken and two more that I haven't bothered to see yet .
406706	2020269	462499	8.0	The Fantastic Ode to Senseless & Gratuitous Violence ; by Sly Stallone .	Now that he has reached the respectable ( at least , for an action hero ) ago of 61 , it seems as if Mr . Stallone can do whatever the hell he pleases ! At several times during watching the brand new and almost indescribably violent " Rambo " , it's almost like you hear Sly thinking : " Screw everybody , I'm doing this film MY way ! " And good for him ! " Rambo " is quite possibly the most nihilistic violent film with blockbuster ambitions ever released and , albeit entirely pointless and forgettable , it inarguably delivers thrills and great entertainment . And , pardon my bluntness , but ? if you walked into the theater expecting anything more than extreme violence and senseless shootouts , well , than you only have yourself to blame for the disappointment . John Rambo now peacefully lives in a swamp in Thailand , where he fills his days fetching venomous snakes and fabricating his own boat propellers . He turned his back on warfare as well as on peace initiatives , and when a group of American missionaries politely requests him to guide them over dangerous rivers & swamps in order to bring medicines to helpless villagers in Burma , he simply replies with " F the World " . However , when a beautiful female expedition member makes the same request , Rambo accepts ? But he still objects . And with good reason , of course , as the missionaries are captured and imprisoned by the sadistic Burmese army . The pre-credits opening sequence already illustrated that Burmese soldiers enjoy toying around with their POW's , like for example forcing them to run through an a mine-infested meadow and then still executing the ones who made it , so the volunteers ' fates don't look too hopeful . Hired mercenaries are sent in to free them and guess who joins the party ? ! If you really do feel the need to defend this film , you could always say the setting and background of the story are original and absorbing . No movie script ever revolves on the dramatic situation in Burma , probably because there isn't much foreign involvement in this war , but the documentary-styled images of famine and dying children at the beginning of the film are just as haunting and nightmarish as those of the wars in , say , Rwanda , Vietnam and Somalia . But seriously , in spite of the presumably ambitious political undertones , you should primarily watch this movie because it's John Rambo kicking arse ; more relentless and barbaric than ever ! There will be blood ? and lots of it ? but there will also be exploding heads , arrows through the eye , disembowelment ( how I love that word ) , slit throats and gigantic explosions ! One particular and extraordinary adrenalin-rushing sequence simply shows Sly operating some sort of powerful machine gun ( sorry , I'm not an expert ) for several long minutes and single-handedly massacring the entire Burmese army . You know what you're watching is preposterous and just plain wrong , but it's so damn freaking awesome at the same time ! Say whatever you want about Stallone , but he's still extremely fit for his age although I did appreciate that he kept his shirt on throughout the entire film this time . His acting performance is more than satisfying as well , and he receives excellent support from several other impressively build beefcakes ( Graham McTavish , Matthew Marsden , Jake La Botz , ? ) and the lovely Julie Benz . I wouldn't exactly recommend to see " Rambo " on your first date with that lovely girl you always dreamed of , but for all other occasions , this is great stuff , pure testosterone on film ! Oh and stunningly superbe soundtrack , too !
406325	2020269	83557	8.0	A Paranoid Android's Gotta Do What a Paranoid Android's Gotta do !	The least you can say about Aaron Lipstadt's " Android " is that it is a bit of a maverick and rarity in the universe of early 80's cinema . In an era when people automatically associated the Science-Fiction genre with either hideous invincible creatures ( " Alien " ) or adventurous fantasy ( the " Star Wars " - trilogy ) , this movie actually attempts to make a character-study / drama using exclusively Sci-Fi characters . " Android " feels like a successful mixture between the themes of " Saturn 3 " and even the embittered atmosphere the almighty classic " Blade Runner " . That is highly ambitious and praiseworthy , especially since the credits list Roger Corman's name as an executive producer and during that time he was mostly infamous for his excessively violent and exploitative rip-offs . The always amazing Klaus Kinski gives a perplexing performance as a mysterious scientist , illegally constructing androids in a space-station far far away . Dr . Daniel is continuously preoccupied with his work whilst his android assistant Max 404 plays videogames and secretly craves to learn more about being a human . The arrival of three fugitive criminals drastically alters their existence . One of them is namely a woman , and both Dr . Daniel and Max are enchanted by her appearance albeit for totally different reasons . The good doctor finally sees an opportunity to research the possibility of a female android and Max discovers emotions he didn't even know existed . It gets worse when Max learns he's disposable and rebels against superior . " Android " benefits most from its witty and inventively written script . The film is most impressive when relying on substance and acting performances , as the special effects and decors appear miserably cheap and tacky . The " surprise " ending is efficient and unpredictably without being overly far-fetched . Kinski is , as said , genius is his familiar role of eccentric and slightly offbeat scientist , but Don Opper ( who also co-wrote the film ) is at least equally astounding as Max 404 . Not only does he look uncanny and artificial , but his grimaces and movements are truly spot-on ! Extra admirable is that neither Don Opper nor director Aaron Lipstadt had any cinematic experience before they worked on " Android " together . This may be an anonymous and underrated movie , but to me it's one of the most remarkable films of the 80's . Highly recommended .
405498	2020269	35009	8.0	Kitsch , a Werewolf and an utterly mad scientist ! What more could you wish for ?	This is a really cool movie and , no ? I'm not joking ! The Mad Monster is a pleasant and fairly original camp-film obviously trying to pick in on the Universal Monster successes . But who cares if it can't live up to the preciously wealthy production values of those films ? I sure don't and especially not since it features werewolves and insane men of science which are my two top favorite horror topics ! It stars the infamous B-movie legend George Zucco as the very devoted ? but equally insane ? scientist Dr . Cameron who got banned from the academic community because of his unethical and inhuman experiments . Cameron plots a violent vengeance on those who discredited them and with his groundbreaking new formulas he manages to turn his slightly retarded gardener into a ravenous werewolf . While his cute daughter is unaware of what happens in her father's lab , Cameron sends out his creation to devour his scientific competitors . I can't stress this enough : this film is fun ! Not very scary , of course , and the werewolf-transformations & killings mostly happen off-screen . And even when they do make an attempt to use special effects or make up it looks really cheap and kitschy . So , lovers of new-age computerized gore should avoid this at all costs . Zucco is really terrific and the madness can be seen in his eyes throughout the entire film ! He even holds imaginary meetings in his basement , trying to convince the world his visions are brilliant ! I love this ; Zucco surely ranks amongst cinema's most memorable demented doctors . Glenn Strange also was an outstanding casting choice to play the not-so-clever guinea pig . Strange looks an awful lot like Lon Chaney Jr . who made himself immortal one year before by playing ? . The Wolf Man ! If you're intrigued by undiscovered horror gems , werewolf horror films or just ordinary cult-amusement this is your film ! Highly recommended !
405893	2020269	222054	8.0	Sigh ? Childhood memories !	Roughly translated as ' Fearless John ' , this is a 100 % Belgian production . Based on a wonderful book and turned into a rather well made and imaginative animated film in 1984 . Around that time ( and long afterwards ) this local figure was more popular than international action heroes like Superman or Batman . I clearly remember the days when every kid in the schoolyard wanted to be Jan Zonder Vrees . He's a very strong and charismatic figure who lived in Antwerp , round the 15th Century . Jan Zonder Vrees is some sort of Robin Hood , only he doesn't steal from the rich . He protects the poor physically and he makes sure justice comes to the ones who deserve it . He fears nothing and accepts every challenge , no matter how dangerous and deadly it turns out to be . He's constantly looking for new thrills to live and mysteries to solve . The art and drawing skills in this film are surprisingly professional , seeing it's only is a ' small ' Belgian production . Yet , it contains a little too much lame sequences in which nothing really happens . But only the adult viewers will notice this ? through the eyes of the younger audience , all these sequences will look fascinating nevertheless . Jan speaks with the voice of Jan Declair . A famous and legendary Belgian cinema-icon who once turned down international success by declining the role of the villain in a James Bond movie . Due to the new evolutions and a lot diversion in animated cinema , this premise got forgotten a little . It all looks less impressive nowadays and modern children are already used to seeing more terrific graphics . Nonetheless , I'd like to encourage as much parents as possible to watch this film along with their youngsters . They might still be enchanted by the fable of Jan ?
405371	2020269	87092	8.0	From zero to hero in 72 miles	It's truly incomprehensible how some rubbishy movies are so popular and easily available whilst , at the same time , there still are such wonderful gems out there that sadly remain obscure and undiscovered . I doubt many people have ever heard of " Death Run " ( a . k . a " Courage " and " Raw Courage " ) . I hadn't heard about it either , before an even bigger movie-buff than myself recommended it to me . It's a damn shame that this film is so underrated because it's a terrifically tense and action-packed 80's thriller with great acting performances as well as a solid screenplay and a unique setting . " Death Run " is more or less Ronny Cox ' one-man-project . This shamefully neglected B-movie star co-wrote , produced and starred as one the lead characters , and he did a tremendously fine job in all three areas . Three generations of ambitious runners decide to run through the desert area for charity . Pete Canfield ( Cox ) is the elderly guy who never was quite satisfied with what he accomplished in life , Craig ( Tim Maier ) is the young lad who's constantly put under pressure by his dominant father and middle-aged Roger ( Art Hindle ) is the potent friend who endless supports and consults the other two . Deep into the desert , the trio encounters a bunch of crazed wannabe-military vigilantes from Denver ( led by the sneering M . Emmet Walsh , who's once again in great shape ) . When their dangerous " training exercises " go awry and result into a fatal accident , the protagonists literally have to run for their lives , as the vigilantes won't allow them to reach the end of the desert alive . And since it's incredibly hard to outrun maniacs on motorcycles , they may even have to put up a fight . " Death Run " is drama , satire , action , and revenge-exploitation all in one . The premise is simple but effective and especially the villains are menacingly realistic . Crazed and trigger-happy vigilantes form a much bigger threat than , say , giant desert worms or space invaders and hence the suspense is much more genuine . The script makes full use of the inescapable desert location , with all its natural death traps and hideout places . There are some unexpected surprises and effective shocks to experience in this movie and the sober musical guidance is excellent . Personally , I think the ending could have been a little better , but generally speaking " Death Run " is an awesome film and here's to hoping a fancy DVD-release will follow soon . Recommended , for sure .
406034	2020269	473492	8.0	" HELL " perfectly epitomizes the atmosphere of the film .	Ah , the cinematic industry of my beloved home country ? I'm usually very skeptical when it comes Belgian movies , because for some reason the writers and directors in this nation always exaggerate immensely when it comes to building up atmosphere . Either the films become so over-the-top dramatic that the story becomes implausible and pathetic , or the script contains too much typically Belgian ( = rancid ) humor that brings down the quality of the story . " De Hel van Tangiers " is entirely different ! Of course , it's not the type of story that lends itself to revert to comical situations , but I was particularly concerned about the drama elements . If you're familiar with the facts in the case on which this movie is based , you just know that it is the ideal opportunity for scriptwriters to exploit the drama and sentimentality . But I'm pleasantly surprised to see that all the emotional sequences are realistic and sincere . Most of the based-on-true-story dramas try ridiculously hard to bring tears to your eyes , but " De Hel van Tangiers " achieves this simply through powerful acting performances and by maintaining an objective point of view . Even though padded with fictional aspects , the plot remains fairly loyal ( at least , as far as I recall the news reports of that time ) to the horribly inhuman drama that overcame tourist bus driver Pierre Stukken in 1996 . On his way back from Morocco , he ( renamed Marcel Van Loock in the film ) and his co-driver Wim Moreels were arrested because there was more than 300Kg of drugs hidden in their bus . Despite confessions from the company's boss , stating that the driver was completely unaware of the drugs he was smuggling , Stukken was nevertheless sentenced to five years in a Moroccan prison , only because of the corrupt system . Whilst he spent 27 inhumanly months in a place worse than hell , his helpless family is catapulted back and forth between the complex Belgian legislation without any results . " De Hel van Tanger " is a courageous and important Belgian piece of cinema , because it effectively depicts the malfunctioning of both national and international legal systems ! The Belgian government didn't do anything for the poor family until the media got too closely involved and particularly the mismanagement of non-European prisons is forcefully criticized . The comparisons between this film and " Midnight Express " are fairly just , as both films terrifically capture the gritty and claustrophobic atmosphere of foreign prisons . The sequences inside the prison's walls are genuinely shocking and definitely not appropriate for people with a weak stomach . The place is filthy , the cells are severely overpopulated and you can't even afford half-decent food if you don't exchange it for cigarettes . Observing Marcel's physical & mental deterioration in this god-awful place is honestly depressing and therefore the title " Hell of Tangiers " is aptly chosen . The film owes a lot of its power to Filip Peeters magnificent and truly devoted performance . Peeters lost over 30kg of weight to make for the role and , near the end of the film , it really looks as if he spent those 27 months in hell . The rest of the cast exists of solid performers who are all quite famous and reliable according to Belgian standards and Frank Van Mechelen's directing is more than satisfying as well . With the financial help of commercial TV-stations , Flemish cinema is moving upwards lately and " De Hel van Tanger " is proof that things are moving towards the right direction .
406033	2020269	1028528	8.0	The Road to Hell is paved with awesome QT dialogs !	For the first time in my life , I actually regret not being an American citizen . Why ? Because only in the U . S of A . you could see " Death Proof " as it was initially intended by the genius filmmaker Quentin Tarantino ; namely as a more or less short ( + / - 75 min . ) segment in a double-feature tribute to the long-lost days of Grindhouse house cinema . Over here in Europe - Belgium to be more specific - , distributors feared that the audiences would not understand the concept and therefore they opted to release both segments separately and , to my biggest regret , without the fake trailers in between . At least , that's the official version . It's also possible they wanted to make double the money on the same film , because the films were released with a period of two months in between . Of course , a running time of barely 75 minutes isn't satisfying anymore in this day and age of expensive cinema tickets , so both segments had to be expanded with additional footage in order to attract people . Now , naturally , the padding is exactly what ruins the concept & basic idea of " Death Proof " , as gritty 70's-type exploitation movies are supposed to be short and to the point ! Without even having seen " Grindhouse " , I could perfectly point out the footage and dialogs that were added to " Death Proof " as these are the exact same sequences that bring down the overall atmosphere of the story . That pretty much concludes my rant , because I nonetheless still very much enjoyed the extended version of " Death Proof " , despite the fact that it obviously robbed Quentin Tarantino of his initial intentions . The majority of dialogs may be unnecessary and overlong , but they still remain brilliant examples of QT's writing talent . This basically means that every line spoken is exciting , stimulating and always smoothly refers to another highlight of the 70's pop culture . There isn't a single line or detail in the screenplay that doesn't bring homage to another movie . Some of the references are obvious , whereas other ones are subtler and a true joy for the exploitation connoisseurs to discover . The actual plot is rudimentary , like it should . For reasons that remain unmotivated , the psychopathic Stuntman Mike terrorizes groups of young & luscious women , using only his menacing " Death Proof " car . He hangs around lurid bars and shops , where he extendedly observes their behavior and overhears their conversations before stalking them in his diabolical vehicle . The first clique of girls ( among them the gorgeous Jordan Ladd , Rose McGowan and Vanessa Ferlito ) forms a fairly easy target , but the second group ( Rosario Dawson , Sydney Tamiia Poitier , Zoe Bell ) is much tougher and fights back , resulting in a head spinning and masterfully staged chase across the forsaken countryside . Kurt Russell is tremendous as the utterly deranged Stuntman Mike and he clearly hasn't had this much fun playing a character since " Escape from New York " , back in 1981 . The girls are all terrific and damn sexy , with the exception of Jungle Julia who exaggerates too much with her rough - black - chick - from - the - hood act . Also , awesome soundtrack ( courtesy of numerous older films ) , delightful editing & sound effects and remarkably cool cameos , including QT himself and fellow director mate Eli Roth . Brilliant film-making , whether or not in its original form .
405962	2020269	86610	8.0	eXTRaOrdinary Sci-Fi fodder . . .	Nasty , cheap and very UN-British " Alien " - rip off from the UK , oddly compelling and containing a handful of powerful and memorable sh ( l ) ock-sequences . The film certainly doesn't cut back on the gory and grim images , making it look a lot more like typical drive-in junk instead of an English horror achievement . The title means absolutely nothing but presumably refers to the malicious alien-race that abducts family men from their homes , only to send them back three years later as infiltrating and telekinetically gifted monsters . This is what happens to poor Sam Phillips during a vacation with his wife and son . He disappears , nobody believes the little boy who saw his daddy getting sucked into a gigantic spaceship and mommy starts a new life with another man . But three years later , a hideously crawling alien impregnates a lonely housewife and ? the morning after ? she ( very ) painfully gives birth to a fully-grown Sam-clone . The evil alien in human shape returns to his old " home " and manages to inflict his monstrous powers onto his son . " XTRO " is a strange mix of genuinely gross material and over-the-top cheesy scenes . The previously mentioned birth-sequence , for example , is pretty disgusting but only minutes later we're treated to a murder committed by a life-sized G . I . Joe doll ! Both scenes are the complete opposite in tone , yet they ( and several other downright bizarre stuff ) strangely match together in this wonderfully oddball Sci-Fi romp . " Xtro " also even managed to scare me , since it features a midget-clown ( ! ) that appears in little Tony's room out of the blue . Perhaps it's just my personal phobia towards dwarfs ( no offense to little people ) , but his little painted and grinning face looked seriously eerie . It freaked me out ! There are no other terms to summarize this film than just plain & simply GOOFY and ODD ! You'll never again see so many twisted story lines blend with surreal elements , kitschy comedy , gratuitous nudity ( oh yes ! We love you Maryam d'Abo ! ! ! ) and gruesome make-up effects . And , even though overall inept and rather dumb , it's simply impossible to give a low rating to this exceptional horror gem ! If you're into eccentric cinema , you must ? MUST check this baby out !
404836	2020269	86288	8.0	Dark & gritty giallo ; sadly forgotten .	The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino ( " The Antichrist " , " The Killer is on the Phone " ) is a truly suspenseful but incomprehensibly neglected giallo , containing pretty much all the trademarks that makes this Italian horror sub genre so magnificent and addictive to the fans . There are some very disturbing themes ( child abuse , phony priests ? ) , loads of creepy moments , plot twists left & right , outstanding music and ? last but not least ? a handful of really sadistic murder scenes ! Especially the opening sequence , which is some kind of prologue , is a powerful piece of horror ! What is it about ordinary child dolls that make them so creepy ? When the anonymous man , dressed up like a priest , assaulted a little girl and the broken head of her doll bounced down a flight of stairs , it really sent cold shivers through my spine ! Years later , the young girl from the prologue is an adult woman bound to a wheelchair . She inherited a lot of money but uses her fortune to stimulate fellow handicapped people to practice sports and to remain positive-minded . She ? Joanna ? falls in love with her personal coach and they get married right away . Naturally , he's only after her money and starts terrorizing Joanna by making her relive the childhood trauma that crippled her . The repeated images of a sinister looking priest , guided by eerie tunes and a nursery rhyme , provide " Formula for a Murder " with a ton of genuine scares and Alberto De Martino's directing is very resolute . The acting is quite competent , with David Warbeck ( " The Beyond " , " The Black Cat " ) in a glorious greedy villain role . Due some plot holes and a lack of originality , this movie might not be able to compete with Italy's best horror efforts , but it definitely deserves more attention . Many formerly obscure and unknown Italian gialli received marvelous DVD-releases and , hopefully , " Formula for a Murder " will be given the same treatment really soon . In the meantime , good luck tracking this baby down !
405125	2020269	95728	9.0	Sergio Stivaletti is a Genius !	" Spider Labyrinth " is a strange and slow but engaging Giallo-type thriller that doesn't have any big names involved in the production ( except maybe ? if you're an insider ? special effects wizard Sergio Stivaletti ) but it nevertheless stands as one of the greatest undiscovered gems of late 80's Italian horror cinema . Around this time , the Giallo ( which is essentially a stalk & slash movie with some additional trademarks ) ran low on inspiration , but this movie brings some imaginative diversity to the sub genre by adding occult sub plots . Sort of like Sergio Martino already attempted to achieve in the early seventies with " All the Colors of the Dark " . The plot opens with a brief but atmospheric flashback / dream sequence immediately clarifying the protagonist's link and phobia for large spiders ; a small detail that will prove very relevant later in the film . Alan Whitmore is an American professor studying ancient dead languages . He's part of his university's project called Intextus , which concerns professors from all around the globe collaborating to translate and comprehend one specific long lost language . The correspondent in Budapest ? Prof . Roth ? hasn't been heard of in a long time and , since his input is particularly fundamental , Alan is assigned to travel to Hungary and meet up with him . Alan arrives in an overall uncanny and hostile environment , but nevertheless comes into contact with Roth through his amiable and stunningly beautiful secretary Genevieve . Shortly after , Prof . Roth is found murdered under mysterious circumstances and Alan gradually becomes sucked deeper and deeper into a ( spider's ) cobweb of occult conspiracies . Slow and indistinctive at first , " Spider Labyrinth " marvelously unfolds into a hugely macabre and unnerving thriller . Considering the plot ( and perhaps after a few slight changes ) and some of the malignant characters , THIS should have been the final chapter in Dario Argento's Three Mothers trilogy ! Director Gianfranco Giagni may perhaps be a relatively unknown name in the Italian horror industry , but he promptly proves himself to be capable of maintaining a grisly atmosphere throughout the film and even proportionally builds up more tension towards a literally mesmerizing climax . The sinister Budapest filming locations form the ideal setting for a tale like this , but everything else is entirely Giagni's accomplishment ( like , for example , empty swings and toy balls bouncing seemly by themselves ) . Then , last but not least , there's the work of Sergio Stivaletti in the special effects department . The effects ? and particularly those during the finale ? are shocking and masterfully nauseating . I've always been a big fan of Sergio Stivaletti's ' art ' and once again he surpassed himself his own craftsmanship . If you like horror , and I do mean Horror with a capital H , I guarantee you'll be staring at the last fifteen minutes of " Spider Labyrinth " with your mouth and eyes wide open . Bravo , Mr . Stivaletti !
404381	2020269	454839	9.0	Torn , beaten and broken beyond repair !	" Broken " is one of the most intense , disturbing and grueling low-budget horror films of the past two decades , especially because the female protagonists in the story ( who're subjected to endless torture and all possible types of humiliation ) aren't granted a single moment of hope or salvation throughout the entire playtime . This film somewhat feels like a throwback to the nihilistic and misogyny exploitation efforts of the redneck 70's , but with the nauseating gore effects and detailed sickness of nowadays shock-cinema highlights , like " Hostel " and " Wolf Creek " . The opening sequences immediately assure us that " Broken " isn't intended for the eyes ( and stomaches ) of squeamish people , as we witness a woman tied up by her neck from a tree and her only chance to escape is by cutting the rope with a razor . Slight obstacle , though . . . the razor is sewn to the inside of her stomach and needs to be picked out manually . This sequence alone is sickening , shocking , incredibly hard to watch and it was enough reason for several people to leave the theater already . Be warned and advised : you better wait at least a couple of hours after finishing dinner in case you plan to watch this film . A brief message before the opening credits also states that " Broken " is based on true events . Even though this warning should be interpreted rather loosely , there's nevertheless some truth in it . The character of " The Man " , and especially his modus operandi , is inspired by the Alaskan serial killer Robert Christian Hansen , who kidnapped random woman and released them in the woods only to hunt them down again . The Man's main target is a single mother named Hope , but she gradually grows stronger and more recalcitrant . Driven by the desire to see her daughter again , Hope eventually even fights back . . . . " Broken " is a truly respectable film , because it was made with almost no money but with a very dedicated cast & crew . Clearly every penny went straight to the make-up effects , while the performers weren't paid and the shooting took place during weekends . How encouraging to know there still are passionate filmmakers out there ; men and women who're prepared to do everything in order to present their genre film to real horror fanatics ! The gore is naturally staggering , but it never really feels completely gratuitous and / or overly exploitative . The excruciating violence always serves a purpose and Boyes & Mason constantly sustain an agonizing atmosphere . The photography is surprisingly professional , as the duo of directors actually succeed in depicting the ambush-filled woods as a supportive characters that is almost equally menacing as The Man himself . " Broken " is a powerful and sinister , albeit unpleasant viewing experience in survival horror that is guaranteed to impress even the most hardened genre fan . And if you think you've seen everything , just wait for the absolutely unforgettable and mean-spirited finale .
406451	2020269	757061	9.0	Disturbing , passionate and gruesome !	Wow ! If you're about to watch " Imprint " , you should prepare for sixty of the most intense and horrific minutes of your life , as Takashi Miike's contribution to the " Masters of Horror " - franchise is , in one word , perplexing ! I have yet to see the director's acclaimed masterpiece " Audition " but , until then , this is definitely my most favorite piece of his work ! The themes and style here are totally different to , say , " Itchi the Killer " or " Fudoh " , but it's disturbing and terrifying on entirely different levels . The story is macabre and definitely has an Asian folklore feel to it , but the torture sequences and perverted sub themes are typically Takashi Miike ; meaning very explicit , shocking and on the verge of sickening . It's also a real pleasure to see the hugely underrated actor Billy Drago star in a glorious horror project again ! He also appeared in the recent ( and surprisingly great " The Hills Have Eyes " - remake ) , so here's to hoping that this charismatic actor is in the middle of making a successful comeback ! Drago plays a mysterious American who travels through Japan all by himself to find the lost love of his life . He arrives on a crazy island where only prostitutes and their pimps live and discovers that the woman he loved passed away . Her sad story is told to him by a deformed whore who also has a lot of other peculiar revelations to share , each one more morbid and repellent than the other . " Imprint " was banned in the States for some obvious reasons , notably the incredibly unsettling torture scene in which a poor girl's fingers and gums are used as a pin-cushion ! I'm used to a lot , but this particular part was really hard to watch . Other deeply shocking moments of the story include a brutal and detailed abortion sequence and the overall nihilistic attitude towards unborn humans . This short movie is beautifully made , with sublime camera-work and masterful make-up effects . Miike's directing is solid as a rock and proves that he truly deserves to be called a " Master of Horror " . " Imprint " is often hard to watch but impossible to forget . Highly recommended !
406155	2020269	74486	9.0	The twisted world of David Lynch	I'm always a bit worried when I'm about to express my love towards this movie by the genius director David Lynch . . . I figure it's the perfect indicator for psychiatrists to claim that you're completely nuts : ) But what the heck , they're a lot of nutballs on this website , so I can speak my mind freely . Indeed , I love this movie . . . although ' love ' may be a wrong term to describe my feelings towards it . This movie ' fascinates ' me is a much better saying . Usually , a movie is something in which you can live yourself in . . . in order to escape the stress of real life . Eraserhead is the exact opposite of that ! When watching this film , you can only hope that you'll never awake in the wold like Lynch shows it here . The horrible noises , the colorless and tasteless locations and the insensible characters . . . you all hate to love it . Eraserhead takes a walk with your emotions , you don't know whether to be disgusted or intrigued by it . So you'll feel uncomfortable when watching it and that's a wonderful experience for a cinema freak ! Eraserhead is the ultimate cult film in my opinion and a must see for every fan of this delicious genre . In fact , I would go so far to say you can't call yourself a cult-freak if you haven't seen it yet . David Lynch begins his highly impressive career with this one and it still lives on . Eraserhead isn't his best film at all ( certainly not when it comes to storyline ) but it's his most deep and personal tale . 25 years old and still the " weirdest " film ever . That's an achievement , certainly with all this artistic filmmakers lately . . . or , at least , they try to be . . . ) I want to encourage as much people as possible to see this one , but it's for the best that some groups of people avoid it . Surely not recommended if you're depressed or suicidal . . . The image of Jack Nance and the rest of the cast could even put you more down , I think . The tagline of this movie - " In heaven , everything looks fine " - could become a stimulus , I'm afraid . Pregnant women and young couples in love should beware as well ! ! This film is the ultimate nightmare for that what should be the greatest miracle of life . . . The hideous but yet harmless " baby " ( I really don't know how I should call it , actually ) is the purest form of horror that ever occurred on the screen . You must have respect for director David Lynch . If you imagine how hard it must have been to create and finance this production . But it worked . . . hell , even comedy legend Mel Brooks was deeply impressed . Based on this film , he decided to let Lynch direct " The Elephant Man " a few years later . By that , David's career was launched and of course he made a masterpiece out of it . For me personally , his highlights were the 80's with terrific movies like " Blue Velvet " , " Dune " ( very underrated , in my opinion ) and " Wild at Heart " at the end of the decade . And let's not forget the best TV-series ever made : " Twin Peaks " . Please , watch this movie ! ! Three times in a row if possible . I know a lot of people who just stopped watching it after half and hour ( or less ) and yelled " What the f is this ? ? ? " . Real shame , if you ask me . It's an insight to a great mind and a unique event . If you really don't see the magic of it , at least try to admire the very stylish haircut of the main character . I'm thinking of doing the same thing with mine . . .
404717	2020269	74451	9.0	Fear . . . but mostly beauty , seduction and complexity !	Paolo Cavara may not be the most famous horror director of Italy , but he certainly deserves the endless respect of true genre fans for the movies he made in the Mondo Cane-series and ? his TWO genuine Gialli masterpieces ! " The Black Belly of the Tarantula " is generally considered to be a classic in the genre , but this " Plot of Fear " is rather difficult to obtain and therefore still sadly underrated . This is an almost indescribably stylish Giallo-cocktail , properly blending together all the fundamental ingredients and many more . The plot is extremely convoluted , like it should be , and covers multiple themes including secret sex-networks , diamond smuggling and of course a bizarre series of grisly murders . The witty police Lieutenant slash playboy Lomenzo investigates several murders that are unquestionably connected , as the killer left behind drawings of a famous children's book on the victims ' mutilated bodies . With the help of his ravishing new French girlfriend Jeanne , Lomenzo discovers that the murdered people were all members of a wealthy clique that secretly gathered to play kinky sex games . During one of these decadent gatherings , a young prostitute named Rosa accidentally ( ? ) died and it looks as if someone is avenging her by eliminating all members one by one . I admit this brief description sounds like the repetitive premise of any regular textbook thriller , but I also assure you that the actual elaboration of the plot is much more twisted and engaging . Paolo Cavara maintains a constant level of high suspense and always adds new and misleading plot twists at the exact right times . The murders , although not specifically gory or shocking , are diverse and original ! And they're definitely unpredictable , as one victims is even shot live on TV during an interview . " Plot of Fear " is also one of the most beautifully made Gialli I've ever encountered . Words can hardly describe how stylish Franco Di Giacomo's cinematography is and Daniele Patucchi's moody soundtrack also contributes a great deal to the overall tense atmosphere of the film . Lieutenant Lomenzo surely is one of the most humorist characters to ever appear in a Giallo film . His remarks against beautiful women and his rather awkward interpretation of police work often results is very comical sequences that help you to digest the confusing subject matter a little easier . There's a fair portion of sleaze and female nudity to enjoy , but it always remains tasteless , with the extended and clearly passionate love-making session between Jeanne and Lomenzo as an absolute highlight . The cast features several prominent and awesomely talented names , which makes it all the more difficult to comprehend why this Italian gem is still so obscure ! " Plot of Fear " stars Euro-horror regulars John Steiner and Jacques Herlin and ? most of all ? features curious supportive roles of no less than Tom Skerritt ( looking like a true Italian , but poorly dubbed ) and Spaghetti Western legend Eli Wallach . ; I would have loved to reward it with an impeccable score , but the finale is slightly too grotesque to refer to " Plot of Fear " as entirely perfect .
405999	2020269	69818	9.0	Tough characters , rough action ? Brilliant Italian cinema !	The other reviewers are right . It may be an incredibly statement to make , especially since there are so many classic and legendary milestone titles in the genre , but " The Boss " may very well be one of the greatest mafia films ever made ! This movie is strictly 100 % hardcore-to-the-bone excitement , with ultra-sadistic characters , nasty double-crossings , merciless executions and explosive vendettas that require urgent and bloody settlements . There are no good or loyal characters in Fernando Di Leo's depiction of Palermo's mafia ? There are only vicious and emotionless gangsters that would butcher their own parents in order to climb one small step up the Sicilian ladder of power & influence . Even the main character , flawlessly portrayed by Italian cult icon Henry Silva , is a totally relentless bastard that violates women and betrays his closest relatives in exchange for more money and power . Watching this film in all its gritty and violent glory , it's almost depressing to realize that large parts of the script were based on factual events as they occurred in crime-infested Italy during the early 70's . The DVD's commentary track even states that some of the situations were so damn realistic that director Di Leo and other members of the crew had to live with fear for acts of retribution by the local mafia . " The Boss " easily surpasses the status of entertainment and it's even more than just a cult film ; this is essential revolutionary cinema ! The movie opens insanely brilliant , with Sicilian mafia pawn Nick Lanzetta ( Silva ) executing most members of a rivaling clan inside a pornography theater . But he doesn't use normal artillery , oh no ? He uses a genuine grenade-launcher which turns his targets into steaming little piles of humanoid waste ! The pace naturally slows down a bit after this terrific intro , but the dialogs and the story remain utterly compelling and the cast of vile characters that gets introduced is nearly endless , including a sleazy attorney , a nymphomaniac crime lord's daughter and ? my personal favorite - a sarcastically venting chief of police . Following the bloody massacre at the cinema , the last remaining leader of the other mafia family wants revenge and he kidnaps the only daughter of Don Giuseppe Daniello . Lanzetta is sent to free her , but treacherous deals are closed everywhere , even within the eminent Daniello family and with the local commissioner of police . The plot is ? as usually the case in Italian cult cinema ? very convoluted and occasionally difficult to follow , but the action sequences are delicious and several of the plot twists are unpredictable and downright shocking . Henry Silva is phenomenal in his role of relentless killer . His facial expressions never change ( he never even smiles ) and he's ultimately cruel and professional when it comes to doing his " job " . Gianni Garko , playing the commissioner , is splendid as well , particularly when he aggressively shouts at the relatives of dead gangsters because their crying and mourning upsets him ! How tactful ! The music adds an even grimmer atmosphere to the story and the roughly edited cinematography makes the wholesome appear even more realistic . " The Boss " is the final entry in Fernando Di Leo's trilogy revolving on Italy's circle of organized crime , and the other two " Milano Calibre . 9 " and " Man Hunt " are supposed to be even better than this one . Personally I haven't seen them yet , but if the rumors are true then Di Leo deserves a statue for his accomplishments in cult cinema .
405402	2020269	819765	9.0	Dark , gritty , raw and very VERY disturbing !	It's remarkable and quite praiseworthy how writers and directors continue to make great movies out of one of the oldest and most ( over ) used story lines in cinema ! " Dog Bite Dog " is basically not much more than just the simple story of an lone copper obsessively chasing a brilliant criminal , only Pou-Soi Cheang distinguishes his film from the rest by being extremely violent & relentless . This is unquestionably one of the grittiest and most uncompromising movies I've ever seen , with an atmosphere of constant nihilism and characters that seem to come walking straight out of hell ! Not even the installments in Chan-Wook Park's trilogy of vengeance ( with the exception of " Oldboy " , perhaps ) or any other infamous Cat-III film ever released were as sadistic and brutal as some of the events depicted in " Dog Bite Dog " . Pang is a young and ruthless Cambodian assassin who lands in the crowded streets of Hong Kong to eliminate the wife of an eminent judge in a restaurant . When the police arrives at the place , young officer Wai sees how Pang hastily flees from the scene of the crime and follow him . The first actual confrontation between the two rabid dogs results in a gigantic blood bath , as Pang mercilessly kills several hostages and even Wai's long time friend and colleague . From then on begins a thrilling and action-packed cat and mouse game between the frustrated cop and the professional killer . The latter also saves a young girl from the constant sexual abuse of her father and stays with her at her shed in the local garbage dump . What makes this routine action / thriller so fascinating ( apart from the explicit violence ) are the main characters ' backgrounds ! Pang , the hit-man , is a Cambodian orphan and has been trained to fight & kill for money ever since he was a child . He knows no restrictions , has no mercy and barely speaks a word . Wai , the cop , became particularly ruthless and unorthodox ever since his role-model father ( also a cop ) lies in a coma after a drug-related incident . Lai doesn't question suspects and witnesses ; he yells at them and he's prepared to sacrifice everything in order to stop his brand new nemesis . People with a weak stomach or tangled nerves are advised to stay away from this film , because the cruelty and shocks featuring in " Dog Bite Dog " can easily cause nausea . It's not the type of violence where bloodied heads and chopped off limbs fly through the air , but more like the intense and utterly disturbing type where people attempt to crush their opponents mentally as well as physically . The filming locations are effectively dark and eerie and the extremely sober music makes the already harrowing tone of the movie even more petrifying . The performances are terrific ! I wouldn't be surprised if Edison Chen and Sam Lee treated each other like enemies on the film set as well , because their on screen hatred and disgust feels a little too legitimate . " Dog Bite Dog " is a powerful and unforgettable film , highly recommended if you can stomach it . If you fear you can't , just wait a few years for the inevitable American remake which will unquestionably soften the premise a little .
406094	2020269	69840	9.0	Quintessential 70's exploitation !	" The Candy Snatchers " perfectly embodies why so many fans of the horror & cult genre worship the 70's decade ! This is a hard-boiled and intense film , with a shocking and totally unpredictable storyline , utterly deranged characters and it literally doesn't take the slightest notice of political correctness and / or human emotions . Director Guerdon Trueblood and scriptwriter Bryan Gindoff take us on a wild & trashy 70's ride , covering controversial topics such as child abuse , mental handicaps , rape of minors , live burial , Vietnam traumas and brutal murders committed by unusual characters ! A trio of ruthless thugs develops a seemingly waterproof plan to get rich with diamonds very fast . By kidnapping the cute 16-year-old stepdaughter of a diamond trader and demanding a huge ransom , they rest assured of success . Unforeseen complications arise when it turns out that the father isn't in a hurry to rescue his stepdaughter at all . Even more so , Candy's ' unfortunate ' death would result in a huge financial triumph for him , so he sure ain't likely to come up with any type of ransom at all . The other ? if possible even more brilliant ? main storyline centers on a young and autistic boy who witnessed Candy's brutal live burial in a muddy grave with only a small tube for oxygen . He desperately attempts to warn his abusive parents about what he knows , but they're too caught up in their own crazy world of greed and self-pity . Purely talking in terms of grindhouse cinema-sickness , " The Candy Snatchers " leans damn close towards perfection ! The atmosphere is constantly gritty , the violence & sleaze is very explicit and literally every character that walks through the screen is demented ! Even the ones that only appear briefly , like the company manager who laughs hysterically at the poor boy's mental condition or the nasty gun store seller who deliberately ignores the reason why the gangster trio so urgently needs a shotgun . Sensitive viewers and / or people with a weak stomach beware , as poor young Candy goes through a hellish ordeal and the ending surely isn't cheerful . Even technically speaking , this production is far superior in comparison with the majority of 70's genre outings . Although obviously low-budgeted , the cinematography and editing are quite professional and the musical guidance is appropriately unsettling . The acting is top-notch , with an extra special word of praise for the director's young son Christopher in his first and only appearance on the big screen . " The Candy Snatchers " has recently been re-discovered and released in a fancy edition . The DVD is an absolute must have for every fan of the genre .
406540	2020269	66040	9.0	Satan Likes ' em Wayward . . . and Jailbait !	I was part of an extremely fortunate bunch of people who got to see this rare gem of euro-cult cinema on the big screen ; moreover inside an authentic old-fashioned grindhouse type of theater where the walls threaten to fall down at any given moment and the equipment has surely seen better days already . I can assure you these rather primitive viewing conditions add a large portion of raw atmosphere to an already gritty and unsettling film . But nevertheless " Don't Deliver Us From Evil " suffers a little from its own controversial reputation , as it has got a lot more to offer than just graphic shocks and gratuitous nudity . The film poster proudly announces , in letters that are far bigger than the title itself , that this is the only French film to be banned in France . It's a nice promotion stunt , but it only forces potential viewers to anticipate a non-stop sleazy and exploitative smut flick , whereas Joël Séria's film is primarily a beautifully dark and almost poetic depiction of how adolescents of high social descent deal with boredom and sexual curiosity . The script may be loosely inspired by the real-life Parker-Hulme murder case ( the same case Peter Jackson used for his " Heavenly Creatures " ) but I strongly believe Séria also used the opportunity to criticize the hypocrisy of the Catholic Church as well as the unfair French social classification system . During the long & boring nights at the boarding school , 14-year-old Anne becomes interested in salacious literature and she quickly convinces her friend Lore to join her into exploring the exact opposite of all the Catholic mumbo-jumbo that is forced upon them by the nuns and their deeply religious parents . It all starts with naughty , yet harmless games and the discovery of their own bodies & sexuality , but the situation escalates into something genuinely malice . When summer vacation begins , and the girls spend two months away from authority , they perform a ritual to become accepted as disciples of Satan and cross the line for good . Their innocent games are gradually replaced with the the dangerous seduction of mentally unstable men , vicious rites of animal cruelty , arson and eventually murder . Séria's criticism towards the Catholic Church and the authorities ' obnoxiousness is mainly illustrated through the lack of response by the adults ! The film exclusively revolves on the acts of the two girls and never at one point suggests that the grown-ups in their surrounding are even aware of the evil they commit . Anne and Lore actually even bring themselves down in the ( downright staggering and jaw-dropping ) finale because they THINK they'll get caught . The performances of Jeanne Goupil and Catherine Wagener are simply amazing and also very courageous . It's almost unbelievable to accept they 19-20 years old during filming as they honestly look like inexperienced girls who barely hit puberty . Their age and especially the nude sequences they're in often make " Don't Deliver Us From Evil " a terribly difficult film to watch . It feels incredibly wrong to watch at these girls as they're parading in their panties and provocatively seduce men , but it more or less remains a tasteful film at all times . The impact of the message Séria brings probably was a lot more shocking in the prudish France of the early 1970's ? which is undoubtedly why the Church insisted on censorship ? but it's still intense enough to upset audiences even today , and particularly the end-sequence will haunt your thoughts for several days afterwards . It's a beautiful film , with enchanting cinematography by Marcel Combes and an excellent ' La La La ' theme song that regularly gets repeated during the most essential sequences .
405309	2020269	40068	9.0	They did the Mash ! They did the MONSTER Mash !	My first , and considering my preferences in cinema , most anticipated acquaintance with the fine gentlemen Bud Abbott and Lou Costello certainly didn't disappoint . Quite the contrary , " A & C Meet Frankenstein " is a terrific horror-comedy , and we all know how rarely one ever comes across of those ! Comedy ( the kind that is actually funny ) and horror ( the kind that genuinely scares ) are two completely opposite styles and incredibly hard to amalgamate , but Abbott & Costello ? and of course the rest of the cast and crew ? seemingly pull it off without the slightest form of effort . The gags & clichéd comical situations never once negatively affect the overall horrific themes and settings and , vice versa as well , the horror atmosphere is never an obstacle for the humor . In fact , if I hadn't watched a gazillion of horror movies already , this would be the ideal film to carefully introduce me to the genre . The script features all the main horror icons and ? stunningly enough ? they're not caricatures of themselves , the story is engaging and the tone is light-headed . This film is actually a whole lot better than Universal's other attempts to assemble the monsters in one film , like " House of Dracula " , " House of Frankenstein " and " Frankenstein meets the Wolf Man " . Clumsy & easily scared Wilber ( Costello ) and cynical Chick ( Abbott ) work as baggage couriers and become unwillingly involved in a mad monster party when they lose track of two relics meant for Mr . McDougal's Museum of the Macabre . Actually , they didn't just " lose " the relics of Dracula and Frankenstein's monster ? they got up and walked away ! Wilbur was the only one to witness this macabre sight and naturally Chick doesn't believe him . The only person who supports Wilbur is Larry Talbot , but he has some issues of his own since he transforms into a bloodthirsty werewolf each night the moon is full . Meanwhile , Dracula teams up with the ravishing female scientist Dr . Mornay in a search for a brand & docile set of brains to put into the Frankenstein's monster's skull . And which brains are more suitable for this operation than those of poor old Wilbur ? The on screen chemistry between Abbott and Costello is excellent , although that is merely just stating the obvious , but especially their interactions with acclaimed horror icons like Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney Jr . are hugely admirable . Bela , Lon and also Glenn Strange as the monster obviously enjoyed being part of this comical film , still they never once mock their own characters and keep their faces straight even during the most absurd situations . Lugosi is at his most evil self again as Dracula ( a role he hadn't played since the original 1931 classic ) and Chaney once again masterfully depicts his alter ego of the tormented Larry Talbot . The smaller supportive roles are also terrific and for the true horror die-hards there's small but ultimately pleasing surprise at the very end of the film , in the form of a voice everyone will recognize instantly . Great , great , great , GREAT film !
405553	2020269	67446	9.0	Plot twist to the left , red herring to the right ? . Giallo Giallo Giallo ! ! !	Back in the early seventies , during the absolute most glorious years for the Giallo sub genre , I guess it must have been some sort of intense and obsessive competition between the eminent Italian directors to come up with the most exaggeratedly convoluted plots . These movies distinguish themselves from the other sub genres in horror by continuously misleading the audience when it comes to the revealing the identity of a sadistic and ( usually ) masked serial killer , who barbarically slaughters gorgeous and preferably naked ladies with sharp & shining weaponry . If the directors really did try to surpass each other with complex plot-structures and far-fetched denouements , then I bet Luciano Ercoli was one of the genuine winners of that game ! He only made three Gialli and , even though they're not as famous as the works of Dario Argento or Sergio Martino , his films easily rank among the most twisted and extraordinary genre efforts I've ever seen . Ercoli's movies can be recognized by their awkward and flamboyant titles already . Fans of Italian cult-cinema from the 70's are most likely to be intrigued by titles like " Forbidden Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion " , " Death Walks at Midnight " and ? of course ? " Death Walks in High Heels " . Such appealing titles already hint at eventful crime-stories , and by God does Luciano Ercole ever deliver ! " Death Walks in High Heels " is easily my personal favorite of his , as it's a tasteful and well-filled Giallo dish containing all the right ingredients such as graphic murders , beautiful music , suspense and copious amounts of female nudity , demented characters and crazy red herrings . The story opens with the brutal stabbing of a guy with an eye-patch who's fleeing from Paris on the night train . We quickly learn the victim was a notorious criminal who recently stole a valuable loot of diamonds from a bank safe in Paris . When his assailant can't find the diamonds in the luggage , he begins to stalk and threaten the jewel thief's beautiful daughter Nicole , who works as a popular striptease dancer in several Parisian nightclubs . Nicole suspects her drunkard boyfriend to be the culprit and she promptly flees to a little British seaside village with an eye-surgeon she hardly knows . The two enjoy a vivid and highly sexual relationship for a short while , but Nicole's aggressor followed her to England and the death toll rapidly increases . The already fascinating plot of " Death Walks on High Heels " even gets more compelling when a couple of important characters perish and the witty inspectors of Scotland Yard interfere with the investigation . What a thoroughly engaging and exhilarating crime / thriller ! The script doesn't always make sense and I counted at least three major holes / errors in the plot ( situations that are pretty much impossible given the explanation during the climax ) , but " Death Walks in High Heels " is a tremendously entertaining film that you won't mind watching several times without ever getting bored . Luciano Ercoli cleverly sustains a fast pacing as well as a high tension-level , mainly by constantly switching locations , introducing new yet fundamental supportive characters and even implementing insightful flashbacks . The film starts in Paris with only three main characters , yet during the climax in the little English village there suddenly is nearly a dozen people involved in the mystery and several others have already died . Granted , this isn't the most violent Giallo available on the market ( although one particular killing sequence is effectively nauseating ) , but the lack in bloodshed is widely compensated by the insane number of red herrings and ingenious little details to improve the mystery . Ernesto Gastaldi , whose pen literally was a nearly inexhaustible source for Italian cult classics , largely scripted " Death Walks in High Heels " and this also partly explains the film's success . The photography is stunning and extremely stylish , Stelvio Cipriani's score is more than enchanting and ? last but not least ? the acting performances are very pleasing . Susan Scott is an adequate actress and , moreover , a truly ravishing woman ! She's probably the only living female creature who can turn you on simply by eating raw pieces of fish . No kidding ! The others ( male ) actors do a fine job too , including Frank Wolff , Simon Andreu and the always suspicious-looking Luciano Rossi . The absolute best role is for Carlo Gentilli , as the cynic Scotland Yard inspector Baxter . Priority-viewing for the rapidly increasing number of Giallo-fans .
406112	2020269	75342	9.0	Terrific film shamefully ignored over the years !	" The town ? " is an early triumph in the serial-killer section of the horror genre , handling about a small American town terrorized by a masked murderer shortly after the end of World War II . Actually based on true events , the maniac picks out his victims on Lovers Lanes and shoots them without mercy . This important low-budget production , from the hands of the legendary producer Samuel Z . Arkoff , completely depends on unsettling atmosphere and the icky sound editing . The isolated location of a town of the edge of Texas and Arkansas has something raw , primitive and terrifying . This aspect is stressed extra by the grim voice-over that repeatedly informs us about the facts . Although you never get to know much about the killer's identity or personality , it's one of the most fascinating madmen in film history . His heavy breathing and primitive mask ( similar to the one Jason Vorhees wore in F13 part 2 ) make him look truly chilling and mysterious . What's also great about this movie is that it features so many tricks and familiar sub-plots , only they were used here of the first time ! Profiling of the killer , copycat behavior etc ? All this makes " The Town that Dreaded Sundown " a vastly underrated and film and more horror fans should reckon its brilliance . Too bad it's so hard to obtain a decent copy of it . I spent years looking for this film before finally seeing it in poor picture quality . The only few flaws to detect is the lousy and typical redneck humor that director Charles B . Pierce inserts in order to lighten the demanding tone of the film . The same mistake also almost ruined Wes Craven's " Last House on the Left " .
405217	2020269	36733	9.0	ALMOST as brilliant as its predecessor	Lewton's sequel to the almighty " Cat People " is a mesmerizing and elegant fantasy , but it is by no means a horror film . It's a touching drama and a perceptive social portrait that makes a great study on loneliness and creating an alternate dreamworld . In this case : a young girl that hasn't got much contact with her classmates because of her constant daydreaming and often alarms her parents due to her isolated position . Amy eventually finds true friendship in the supernatural form of Irena , the deceased first wife of her father . Although entirely different in purpose and message , " Curse of the Cat People " actually has a lot more in common with its predecessor than it looks . Three essential characters return and their personalities haven't changed . Irena ( played by the goddess Simone Simon ) is still a warm-hearted but frigid woman and Ollie is still a loving man incapable of handling the supernatural events around him . Basically , this sequel is quite a unique achievement in cinema as it forms a solid wholesome with the first , despite implementing an entirely different tone . There are some genuine moments of fear , but these are the result of a terrific sub-plot in which an elderly Mrs . Farren ( Amy's neighbor ) accuses her daughter Barbara of being an impostor and a replacement for her real daughter who died in an accident . The film is beautiful to look at , with a stunning photography and excellent sets . The end-sequence ( involving an imaginary metamorphosis ) is breath-taking and one of the most enchanting moments in cinema history . The acting performances are flawless and the crush I had on Simone Simon only got intenser ! Robert Wise does a terrific directing job ( his debut ) along with the unknown Gunther Von Fritsch . Wise continued working for Val Lewton one year later with the effectively creepy " The Body Snatcher " . I will probably always prefer the original " Cat People " ? simply because that is one of the most impressive and intelligent stories ever ? but this imaginative sequel is almost as brilliant . Highly recommended .
406692	2020269	91630	10.0	Zombies , exploding heads . . . and a date to the prom .	If you like a decent horror film complete with old fashioned make-up effects , you will LOVE this this film . If you like to have a good laugh and some gore when you watch a horror film , you will LOVE this film . . . If you like a combination of both , you will have the time of your life ! This film by Fred Dekker easily joins the chosen few ; funny and at the same time good horror films of the 80's . It's right up this list together with Evil Dead 1 & 2 , Re-animator , the Blob and maybe a few others . The story begins in the 50's . An extra-terrestrial experiment escapes from the spaceship and falls to earth ( By the way . . . Night o / t Creeps has the funniest aliens you'll ever see ) During the same night an psychopath with an axe is loose , this experiment makes its first victim on earth . How ? Slugs enter your mouth , crawl up your brain and there they lay eggs . They breed while the victim walks around . . . dead . Zombies in other words . Very cool . The axe murderer get slaughtered by rookie cop Ray Cameron and the infected person gets frozen . Then the story moves to the 80's . As a prank the frozen man gets released and the terror can begin . Rookie cop Ray Cameron is now detective Cameron and he joins Chris , J . C and the lovely 80's babe Cynthia in their hunting game to kill as much slugs as possible . I realize this is just one man's opinion , but as far as I'm concerned all the elements to great horror are here . Good story with a few nice twists and decent make up effects . Ray Cameron is played by Tom Atkins , a great B-film actor who has amazing expressions in his eyes and a terrific body language . The script contains very funny lines all fired off by him . Example : " well girls , I got good news and bad news . . . the good news is your dates are here . " " What's the bad news ? " " . . . they're dead " . I assure you , this is great fun to watch . And did you think BRAINDEAD was the first film to use a lawnmower as a zombie-weapon ? ? Think again . Add to this a soundtrack with golden oldies from the 50's and you got yourself a piece of pure entertainment . What else could you possibly wish for ? ? Nudity , you say ? OK , the story mostly takes place in a sorority house , so we'll throw in a couple of boobs in as well . My advise , get your hands on it as soon as possible . And then finally this little extra for the horror buffs : Do the following names of the leading characters ring a bell ? ray CAMERON - Cynthia CRONENBERG - Chris ROMERO - J . C HOOPER - Detective LANDIS - Detective RAIMI . . . Indeed , all characters are named after the biggest horror directors . This is a lot of fun when you're watching the film for the 2nd or 3rd time . Heck , even the small roles are filled in . The janitor's name is Mr . Miner ( The first " House " film was directed by Steve Miner ) and even the cat is named GORDON ( Stuart Gordon directed Re-Animator ) . Rent this film . Unfortunately , it hasn't came out on DVD yet . . . damn shame that is . You'll love it and re-watch it over and over again .
404747	2020269	95294	10.0	Evil grows on to its path . . .	Hellbound is the fascinating and almost excellent sequel to the greatest horror story ever written : Hellraiser by Clive Barker . This movie is a must see if you enjoyed the first one ( and I can't imagine you haven't ) . Hellbound is a logical continuing of the saga and begins almost immediately where the first one left off . Like its predecessor , it's a tale of pure terror . Like no other movies , the Hellraiser films create this nightmare world you sure don't want to be a part of . . . I didn't think it would be possible but Hellbound creates and even more morbid and dark atmosphere than Hellraiser . Images of pure horror are showed here and it certainly ain't a pretty sight from time to time . Gruesome make-up effects and clearly showed violence make this motion picture the prototype of pure horror . Add a powerful plot and some terrifying characters to that you got yourself a pure horrorfest and even a damn good movie in general . Doug Bradley returns as the most charismatic horror icon ever created . Pinhead , the lead cenobite . Also the very beautiful Ashley Laurence is back to take up her role again as Kirsty . Too bad these movies were the only highlights in her career . I would have wanted to see a lot more of her . Hellbound takes place in hell for a large part , and it's shown as an endless labyrinth filled with deadly traps , unpleasant surprises and nightmarish visions . Actually , just like you fear it to be . . . SPOILERS . . . the story begins a few hours after the first film finished . Kirsty still is in shock and she's brought to a mental institution . Over there , Dr . Channard is in charge and he happens to be totally obsessed by the mysterious box . He manages to bring Julia ( who died in part one ) back to life but in return for that he asks Julia to show him what Hell is really like . In the meantime , Kirsty still is convinced that she can bring back her father and , along with a mute girl called Tiffany , she faces the Cenobites again . Pinhead and his fellow Cenobites don't want to show any mercy no more but Kirsty has a plan to survive . . . END SPOILERS ! ! ! In my point of view , Hellbound is the perfect horror . I admit there are some flaws to it ( and even a few mistakes ) but it's the ideal movie if you want to be scared , intrigued and fascinated by the more macabre aspects of cinema . I know Robert Ebert doesn't like it very much but what the HELL does he know about it ? ! ? Favorite " rewind " - scene : So many to choose from , but I'll certainly go for an early scene in the movie . Through a pan , the attic of Dr . Channard is shown . This attic contains all the victims Julia needed to become her old self again . Horrific , cruel and brute . . . but oh so beautiful
405671	2020269	64116	10.0	A feast for eyes and ears ! Leone's film is a timeless masterpiece !	THIS is perhaps the greatest film ever made . A passionately penned down portrait revolving on the downfall of the West-era . Brilliantly filmed , with careful attention for the smallest detail and performed by gifted actors and actresses in not so obvious roles . Straight from the slow and clammy opening credits sequence , you notice that this is an epic that will require your full attention and one that'll automatically provoke great feelings of respect and admiration . A cowboy's struggle with a fly is portrayed like it is a devastating battle , guided by unnatural noises on the background that put an extra emphasis on the unbearably tropic climate . This is the merciless West and you need your eyes and ears focused at all times to avoid trouble with someone more powerful than you . I have seen this masterpiece of film-making numberless times now and I still get mesmerized instantly when I behold the atmospheric set-pieces and the ominous characters . A truly magnificent opening to what will become a powerful movie experience and yet nothing of the actual storyline has been revealed yet ! " Once upon a time in the West " is a collaboration between titans . . . For the flawless screenplay , Leone ( already a master-writer himself ) received assistance from no less than Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento ( this latter is a personal God of mine ) . These icons , who already deserve statues for the work they did separately , combine their talents and deliver a genuine western story that involves organized crime , blackmail , revenge and even human emotions . Separate story lines that only come together neatly in the end , after a series of fascinating sequences filled with suspense and dazzling action . Leone grabs every chance to innovate with both hands and this results in unexpected shock moments ( the slaughter of the Irish family ) and even completely unimaginable anti-castings ( Henry Fonda as a relentless gangster ? ) . The main story lines are very diverse but Leone takes his time to slowly clarify them all . Tough guys are hired secure the construction of a railroad while a notorious gangster escapes from jail , only to find out that someone abused his trademarks to get their dirty work done . A beautiful woman has been widowed without knowing it and she stands alone in an abandoned , dangerous land . And then there's a lonely cowboy patiently waiting to fight a personal battle of which no one knows the details . If you've chosen to watch " Once upon a time in the West " , get ready to be overwhelmed by fascination and involvement . . . expect yourself to sit on the edge of your seat , exploring all the corners of the TV-screen as you want to make sure you're not missing a thing ! Leone could count on the perfect cast , with the already mentioned Henry Fonda in an unusual but fitting role and Claudia Cardinale who embodies every male creature's dream . Charles Bronson and Jason Robards complete the great cast , both in the finest roles of their overall brilliant careers . The previously summed up elements already indicate that this is an unmissable cinema event and then I haven't even spoken of the music yet ! For many fans the ultimate reason to point out " Once upon a time in the West " as the greatest film ever made and they're right ! Ennio Morricone's score is so marvelous , so perfect that it began to lead its own life outside the film . The constantly repeated tunes " Man with the Harmonica " and " Goodbye to Cheyenne " cause a chemical reaction inside your body every time and they provide the story with extra depth and atmosphere . The images on the screen and the music you hear form a wholesome that can never be topped in cinema . This is the best , period ! We should only use superlatives when talking about this film : the BEST and the most UNIQUE In case I haven't made myself clear thus far : " Once upon a time in the West " is a motion picture that belongs in every DVD-collection . With my most sincere apologies to Sam Peckinpah , John Ford and Howard Hawks but this is simply put the best western ever !
405008	2020269	90197	10.0	Deeply disturbing Spanish masterpiece	The only word that spontaneously comes to mind when briefly describing Agustí Villaronga's " In a Glass Cage " is ? WOW ! This is definitely one of the most intense and harrowing European films ever made . You're most likely to find it in the horror-sections of specialized cult stores / catalogs , but it's SO much more than just horror ! It's a traumatizing post-WWII portrait , a deep psychological drama and a devastating tale about pedophilia & child murder . " In a Glass Cage " is the disturbingly cold and emotionless depiction of a former Nazi figure that escaped to Spain in time , but continues his sick rituals of kidnapping and murdering young boys there . Until one day , feelings of shame and remorse take over and Klaus ( Günter Meisner ) attempts to commit suicide by jumping of a high building . He survives but becomes bound to an iron lung machine and a huge burden to his unknowing wife and daughter . Then , a handsome but strange adolescent man volunteers to be Klaus ' nurse . Angelo seems to know a lot about Klaus ' past and unorthodox desires , yet he doesn't betray him and even offers him the chance to pick up where he left off . An odd escalation of happenings causes Angelo to turn into the most powerful person in the house AND an even bigger monster than Klaus ever was . This often shocking and uncompromising film shows , in a truly alarming style , what possibly could happen to the young and vulnerable minds of pedophilia victims . It might not sound very realistic at first , but when you think it over more carefully , it becomes frighteningly real . Angelo's heartless attitude and charisma come across exactly like those of someone whose childhood innocence was taken from him . Apart from being a truly thought-provoking piece of cinema , " In a Glass Cage " is also an impeccably made and mesmerizing stylish film . The atmosphere is creepy and sinister throughout , with depressing set pieces , sober music and monotonous camera-work . Unquestionably the most staggering piece of scenery is the large iron lung ( the titular glass cage , also ) that breathes for Klaus . This impressive and advanced medical device constantly produces uncanny noises and it looks like the absolute last type of machinery you want your life to depend on . It's a very original and genuinely horrifying object to feature in a tense film like this . Furthermore , there are a couple of shocking scenes that you aren't likely to see in many other films . It already requires a lot of courage to tell a story about pedophilia and child murder , so you can imagine the brutal impact of actually showing these topics graphically ! Villaronga's directing is straightforward and acting performances of the entire cast are flawless and deeply moving . " In a Glass Cage " is a brilliant film , perhaps not accessible for everyone , but enormously recommended to hardcore cult fans .
405587	2020269	71408	10.0	You can say that again ! . . . DeR @ nG ? d ! !	Oh yeah ! This is what us genre fans like to call a REAL horror film ! " Deranged " is shocking , insensitive , cold-hearted and features a ' you - don't - like - it - go - to - hell' - honesty you can't possibly walk away from ! This is the pretty damn factual , and therefore hugely disturbing , reconstruction of the case of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein . This guy was crazier and far more dangerous than any fictional horror character could ever be and therefore he was a nearly endless source of inspiration for independent filmmakers who wanted to bring a horrific tale . " Deranged " appears to be very cheap and amateurish , but it's one of the rare films in which the low budget production values actually contribute in making the story more grim and realistic ! Ed Gein really was a poor and simple-minded farmer who went absolutely berserk after the death of his beloved mother and he refused to accept her passing away by replacing her with cadavers that he kept in his house . The characters ' names have been altered , as well as the timing of the story , but Ezra Cobb's actual crimes are frighteningly truthful and portrayed with a chilling eye for detail . The film's biggest trump is unquestionably the casting of the rather unknown actor Roberts Blossom whose impressive and straight-faced performance will make you more than once wonder whether he isn't a real madman ! Other aspects that definitely increase the creepiness are the constant funeral music that guides the film and the colorless , depressing set pieces . " Deranged " is not a total gorefest ( mainly due to the lack in budget ) but the murders are nonetheless explicitly illustrated and quite bloody . Strangely enough , the film's devastating tone is regularly undercut with brilliant flashes of morbid black humor , like Ezra's encounter with an overweight widow who talks to her deceased husband . In short , " Deranged " is a typically 70's cult treasure that should be watched by every horror fan on this planet .
404304	2020269	52077	10.0	It's a plan all right ? A plan for perfect entertainment ! !	What are all these people moaning about ? I've rarely had more fun while watching a movie as I had with Ed Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space . Besides , most criticism goes out to the lousy scenery and the goofy decors . Well excuse Mr . Wood for not disposing over a huge budget or funds ! He did what he could and sure , the jet cockpit looks amateurish and the Pentagon-offices have the image of being build by a kindergarten-crew but so what ? I have a lot more respect and sympathy for this film than for those over-budgeted , uninspired blockbusters ! Like in ALL of his films , Ed Wood proves that he's full of good intentions , creativity and a strong will to proceed and purchase his dreams . The only thing you can reproach him here , is the silly and pointless screenplay . Aliens are desperately seeking contact with humanity and in their ninth attempt to achieve this , they even resurrect the dead . Why ? ! ? To make humans aware of their existence and to figure as prophets with a message . This is where the silliness comes in . But it all remains pure fun , all the time ! What also makes this film legendary is the fact that it contains the last on-screen appearance by Bela Lugosi . Lugosi died during filming and another guy in a Dracula outfit who constantly hides his face behind a cape ( ! ) replaces him . Am I the only one who thinks this subtle cast-change is absolutely charming and nicely tried ? Vampiria and Tor Johnson are credited as main performances but all the have to do is stumble around and look ghoulish ? not a difficult thing to do if you have the posture of Tor Johnson . Overall , Plan 9 from Outer Space remains the absolute top-recommendation to watch with a group of people when there's beer and snacks .
406051	2020269	90756	10.0	BRIL-LI-ANT ! ! !	Say hello to what is perhaps Lynch's greatest achievement so far . And , with a career like his , that sure does mean something . Every film he made is a remarkable and valuable asset to cinema - masterpieces in their own kind - and Blue Velvet is the absolute highlight for sure . Blue Velvet is the representation of the ' small town'-nightmare , complete with raw drama aspects and shocking realism . Without even trying that hard , Lynch successfully mixes a bunch of taboo subjects here like voyeurism , masochism , corruption , aggression and sodomy . The basic plot might look surprisingly simple , but Lynch tells it to the viewer in a very slow and fascinating way . constantly adding one new element at the time . This simple but effective style instrument really builds up an unbearable tension and a unique morbid atmosphere . Lynch already showed a lot of interest towards the dark side of humanity in his black and white cult film Eraserhead , and he expands this bizarre preference in Blue Velvet . Like no other director , he creates a nightmarish and anti-social universe of which you certainly don't want to be a part of . The most extravagant icon is without a doubt the character of Frank Booth . easily the biggest bastard who ever appeared on the big screen . Amazingly brought to life by Dennis Hopper , this mad mobster is the portrayal of everything that is inhuman and despicable . Every word that comes out of Frank's mouth is either aggressive . or perverted . He's a violent and abusive addict who doesn't seem to have the slightest bit of human emotions or behavior . Dennis Hopper owns this movie and leaves behind the biggest impression you'll ever experience . Blue Velvet contains so many memorable sequences and unforgettable aspects that it's almost impossible to write a summary . Also , it would be a darn shame to spoil anything . The less you know about it before watching , the better . Let ' Blue Velvet ' overwhelm you . rate it on this site . and join the fan-base ! One scene I'm willing to describe a little ( if it were only to encourage you to watch this film ) is Dean Stockwell's terrific little escapade on Roy Orbison's ' In Dreams ' It's impossible to watch this scene without getting cold shivers all over , I assure you . Perhaps the most stunning and atmospheric sequence in all 80's cinema . What are you waiting for ? ! ? Go out and buy Blue Velvet on DVD !
405667	2020269	75462	10.0	Deeply disturbing horror masterpiece !	It literally took me YEARS purchasing this movie and , now that I finally own it , it's still difficult to follow as it is an exclusively Spanish version . Still , every effort I ever took for finding it was worthy , as this is a magnificent piece of horror cinema and easily one of the most disturbing films I ever beheld . The premise of " Quién Puede Matar . . . " is highly original and compelling . Even though it's likely that the script is mildly inspired by both " Lord of the Flies " and " Rosemary's Baby " , it definitely feels unique and like something you've never seen before . The story introduces us to a young couple who take a side-trip to a remote Spanish island where the abandoned streets and ominous silence soon indicates that this is a cursed place . The island's children are seemly under the influence of a ( never explained ) supernatural evil that forces them to slaughter adults ! Before Tom and Evelyn properly begin to understand and accept what's going on , they're in great danger and chased by a merciless army of young maniacs . Even though " Quién puede matar a un niño " is European and made in the 70's , it isn't a gross film . The emphasis lies on the atmosphere and the violence is more suggestive than explicit . There are , nonetheless , a handful of unsettling sequences that involve quite some bloodshed and shocking material . The absolute highlight unquestionably is a scene showing a group of kids playing a seemly harmless game . But then the camera moves up and we see how they're actually molesting the cadaver of an elderly man . . . which is quite a jaw-dropping sight . Director Ibañez-Serrador makes excellent use of the tropical climate and the isolated island-location while the chilling music even increases the already unbearably high suspense-level . The most powerful aspect about this film is probably that we're constantly guessing for the kids ' diabolical urge to kill . The mesmerizing opening credits , showing flashes of news bulletins revolving on abused or starving children , hints us that maybe it's an act of revenge although this is never confirmed . With this praising review , I hope to stimulate many people in tracking this masterpiece down ! This is true horror and great viewing for the real fans . Here's to hoping that this gem soon receives a proper and world-wide DVD release .
