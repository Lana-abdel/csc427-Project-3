404798	2020269	83661	1.0	Luke , I sacrifice virgins . . .	This is a totally unique movie ! Yes ? UNIQUE ! ! And why ? Because it has the most promising and potentially great sounding plot , about the sacrifice of young female virgins to a hideous sea creature on a remote island community , and yet somehow it manages to be an extremely boring and totally uneventful film ! Is that unique or what ? I watched this movie less than 12 hours ago and I already have a hard time remembering what went on , actually . It has a bunch of uninteresting people , among them James Earl Jones , gathering on this peculiar island to search for a missing girl . She's there all right , but so is a freshly resurrected sea monster the natives are forced to feed virgins to ! After that , I kind of lost track of the plot . Though that doesn't really matter , as nothing happens . The characters talk and talk and talk ? and , occasionally , they throw around cats for some reason . There are no gory death sequences or cool sea monster designs , not even a bit of delightful sleaze . The monster is hardly shown on screen and when it is ( for about 5 seconds ) it looks like the most ugliest sock puppet ever . James Earl Jones ' imposing voice is usually joy to listen to , expect when he exclusively talks nonsense like it is the case here . It must have been weird for those few unlucky people who saw " Blood Tide " at the cinema back in 1982 . The Star Wars movies were hugely popular and Jones ' powerful voice was automatically linked to the image of Darth Vader . Can you imagine Vader to jibber about the cheesy sea creatures , ancient Greek myths and virgin sacrifices ? Do your brain a favor and skip this film . . .
405538	2020269	83185	1.0	Makes you want to rip out your eyeballs and EAT THEM !	Ah , the wondrous mysteries of late 70's / early 80's Euro-exploitation cinema ? With almost a 100 % positive certainty , the script of this film was improvised along whilst shooting . Judging by the tone and cheerful atmosphere of the opening sequences , it doesn't even look like the creators ( Alain Deruelle and Julio Tabernero ) ever intended to make a movie about cannibals , but maybe the producers forced them in order to quickly cash in on the gigantic success of contemporary horror-hits like " Cannibal Holocaust " and " Cannibal Ferox " . As you probably know , everything was possible in the exploitation industry , even hiring the notorious smut filmmaker Jess Franco to shoot some additional footage . The film opens with a rhythmic and jolly carnival song , introduces several comical characters and a potentially interesting ( but poorly elaborated ) kidnapping / ransom plot . The cannibal tribe and obligatory grossness only kicks in after about 40 minutes and comes across as totally ridiculous . Three amateur thugs , one voluptuous woman and two guys , randomly decide to abduct the daughter of a wealthy businessman and demand a ransom . When one of their accomplices gets involved in a banal car accident , they flee towards the jungle ( I think the South American ) and seek shelter in the hut of a friend . Nearby there's a tribe of primitive cannibals , but they appear to remain politely within their perimeters . Only when one of the thugs rapes the lady of the house , her husband almost literally feeds them to the cannibals . Meanwhile , the parents of the kidnapped girl have also arrived in the jungle ( don't ask me how , though ) , but they're good people and hence don't get eaten . Needless to say " Cannibal Terror " is an incredibly bad film and I honestly can't name one good element , apart maybe from the jolly theme song . Sure , there's a bit of nasty gore , but there's absolutely no prior tension building and the actual munching goes on for far too long . You know you're in trouble when even the gory bits in a movie are dull . The acting performances are atrocious . The lines of the little girl are practically inaudible and I'm pretty sure an adult woman imitating the voice of a child spoke them . The " jungle " setting is quite hilarious , as the film is clearly shot in someone's home garden and the " natives " are plain white day-players . Several of them even have sideburns and sophisticated haircuts . Oh dear ?
405151	2020269	130633	1.0	It's Alive ! It's . . . Plantenstein !	Watching an actual plant grow from a seed into a colorful flower would be far more exciting than struggling through this horribly inane and ultimately boring movie about an overworked rocket scientist transforming into a deranged and mad-raving horticulturist during his vacation in Tokyo . Okay , say what now ? I kid you not , " The Revenge of Dr . X " ? most inaccurate title ever , by the way ? revolves on a NASA professor who's forced to take some time off whilst his latest missile project floats around in outer space . Dr . Bragain reluctantly accepts a holiday in Japan , but not before picking up a near-dead Venus Flytrap he intends curing . Along with his personal assistant ( a woman who never should have even considered starting an acting career ) he looks after the sickly plant , but it quickly becomes a new obsession . Dr . Bragain turns into a loony amateur Frankenstein when he wants to offer his plant a human mind and uses thunder and lightening to achieve this . The only remotely fun and oddly curious moments in this movie are the opening credits ? since they belong to another film ! See the trivia-section for more details but , unfortunately , Eddie Romero wasn't involved in this production . It was no one less than Ed Wood who penned down this crazed Fauna & Flora adventure , and that actually makes sense because who else could have come up with such nonsense ? The " monster " resembles an exploded banana-tree , the dialogs and particularly James Craig's one-liners are horrendous and 99 % of the sequences are just plain boring . One to avoid at all costs .
406459	2020269	74434	1.0	Kill ' em all , please . . . Slow and painful !	" What a turkey ! " This is a simple line spoken by one of the characters as he's watching a random movie in the drive-in theater , but the phrase is actually much more applicable to the production he's starring in himself ! This is a truly abysmal low-budget horror flick , put together by a bunch of amateurs that know nothing about cinema but simply wanted to cash-in on the success of such contemporary classics like " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " . Two very UN-heroic police detectives investigate a series of murders that all took place in a Californian drive-in movie theater . It looks like some nutbag is practicing his sword-swashbuckling techniques on the horny customers there . The suspects include the theater's owner ( who used to be a carny ) , the simple-minded janitor and the local pervert that spies upon young couples . Apart from some filthy gore ( the best bits occurring in the opening minutes already ) , there's nothing to see here , unless if you're an admirer of bad acting , bad directing , bad editing , bad photography and even worse music . I couldn't understand half of the dialogs because all the moronic characters were mumbling , and the other half just didn't make any sense . The " red herring " climax is overlong and , despite its short running time , there are still way too many boring moments in the script . The concept and set pieces easily could have resulted in a much better ( pre-slasher ? ) horror movie , if only some talent was involved . Incredibly bad film , avoid like the plague .
406266	2020269	395443	1.0	Dull , derivative , dud . . . Like you ought to know beforehand .	Okay , admittedly I wasn't paying too much attention and there probably is a perfectly logical explanation , but there's something about " Alien Lockdown " that I absolutely don't understand . During the opening sequences there's a dull narration about a meteor crashing on earth millions of years ago and bringing forward an emerald-type of talisman that makes whoever owns it invincible ? or something . Then , all of a sudden , we're back in present time ( or even in the future ? ) and the story revolves on mad scientist building the ultimate soldier in a secret laboratory in the Rocky Mountains . What's the connection with the ancient emerald ? Where does the alien tissue come from ? Most important question of all : who the hell cares ? Naturally , the project goes wrong and a military expedition is sent in to exterminate the monster . Yawn ! " Alien Lockdown " is a frustratingly terrible type of horror / Sci-Fi movie . You honestly wonder why they continue to produce movies like this , as the formula has nothing interesting or original to offer anymore . It's just the umpteenth uninspired and dreadful clone of " Alien " and there's really nothing positive to write about . The characters are walking , talking stereotypes , the scenery and locations look second-hand and the atmosphere is non-existent . And the action sequences , well ? You know what they are like : soldiers endlessly wandering around dark corridors with flashlights , then suddenly there's the flashing image of a hideous monster and the next moment the flashlight lies abandoned on the floor . John Savage terribly overacts as the mad scientist , as if he's protesting against all the worthless crap he's starring in lately . Your glorious days of " The Deer Hunter " and " The Onion Field " are long gone , John ? Michelle Goh acts pretentious and wannabe tough , like she's the first female action heroine ever . She probably doesn't realize they only chose her because Lucy Liu is too expensive . Bah , enough time and words wasted on this dud of a film . Just stay away from it !
404618	2020269	82559	1.0	Destroying zombies and chewing tobacco !	God-awful zombie movie that very well might be the WORST Italian horror production ever , and that's saying a lot with all those numberless " Dawn of the Dead " rip-offs and Lucio Fulci wannabes . This movie is incompetent in every possible aspect . It's so bad that it even comes close to ruining the memory of all the good movies it's inspired on ! The story : a factory , strategically located in the middle of the New Guinean jungle , suffers from a complete meltdown and the poisonous gas that escapes causes the native tribes to transform into walking flesh-eating corpses . Two journalists team up with a S . W . A . T team that is sent to the jungle and together they have to kill a whole lot of zombies before they can reach the factory . Naturally , this zombie romp is extremely gory , with brutal massacres and other types of pure filth every 5 seconds . But the make-up effects are pitiful and evoke more chuckles than feelings of disgust . Inspired by the almighty " Cannibal Holocaust " , director Bruno Mattei ( who's my pick for Italy's worst horror director ) stuffs his film with images and footage of real jungle wildlife , only here it's very misplaced and completely pointless . In all honesty , there is ONE good scene involving a child-zombie that effectively illustrates the infection and the impact of the virus on human beings . The acting is terrible and the script contains a countless amount of stupidities like , for example , a detailed course of how to properly chew tobacco . Avoid , unless you're looking for a good laugh and don't mind wasting 100 minutes of your precious life with it .
406022	2020269	79027	1.0	Be VERY afraid of " The Dark "	Yes , be afraid ? Not so much because the plot is disturbing or the monster-effects are frightening ( au contraire ! ) , but actually because it's such an irredeemably bad film that there's a good chance you'll suffer from permanent brain damage ! This has got to be one of the most embarrassing horror productions of the late 70's ( and there are a lot to choose from ) , but what do you expect with a script that hastily got altered in the middle of shooting ? That's right , the monster we're dealing with here is a genuine zombie-alien ! Initially , it was just going to be a zombie , but since Ridley Scott's " Alien " broke a lot of box-office records in the meantime , the producers of " The Dark " thought it would be stupid NOT to cash in on that success ! What do you picture a zombie-alien to look like ? Apparently the writers weren't sure , neither , so eventually it's just an over-sized guy that constantly walks in the dark and occasionally shoots laser beams from his eyes . All by himself , without a spaceship or even some sort of earthly mission , the ' zombalien ' prowls the streets at night , ripping off people's heads and making the local police forces look like complete imbeciles ( which they are ) . William Devane stars as a lonely hippie-loser who does ? nothing , really . The largest part of the film is just plain boring ; the monster's attacks are shown on an entirely black screen with just some cheesy noises on the background , and Cardos ' directing is very muddled . He really isn't to blame , as he took over from Tobe Hooper and never had something that even remotely looks like a script to work with . " The Dark " incomprehensibly wasn't rewarded with a special Oscar for the astonishingly inept visual & make-up effects ! Those laser beam eyes , as well as the subsequent explosions are simply hilarious and pretty much define the term " cheesy " .
404788	2020269	109001	2.0	This phone is DEAD !	Yaaaawn ! I'm so sick and tired of all these wannabe controversial directors and their supposedly ' groundbreaking ' cinema ideas ! Give it up boys ; you're not shocking anybody with your lame crap ! Here we have a new prodigy from the Netherlands ? Theo Van Gogh ? who thought it would be a cool idea to shoot a film about two people nagging over the phone the whole time . A middle-aged divorced man responds to an ad in the paper , placed by a younger woman who offers phone-sex . They make it weekly appointment and they quickly find out their whole lives turns around these weekly conversations now . They masturbate to each other's voice , argue about whether they depend on each other or not ? and then masturbate some more . Very boring and utterly annoying . Maybe it could have worked as a 5 ( or max . 10 minutes ) sketch in an educational talk show or something , but not as a full-length film . And most of all : you get the feeling that you're not supposed to see this ! It's voyeuristic and low ? not the least bit artistic
405325	2020269	91707	2.0	Back to Aladdin with you , dumb " genie " ?	" The Lamp " is incredibly stupid 80's smut that can be found in practically every video store in my country whereas other , much better horror gems from that same decade are nearly impossible to purchase anywhere ! Such a thing annoys the hell out of me ! All in all , there's ONE remotely good sequence in this film ( defenseless girl killed in bathtub by snakes ) , but the remaining 84 minutes are a textbook example of what horror shouldn't be like . Dumb characters run around , doing & saying the most ridiculous things while threatened by an " evil " Djinn that appears to be made out of plasticine . Juvenile delinquents steal the titular lamp from an old lady's house and get killed . The ancient relic then becomes property of a national museum in Texas for further examination and exhibition . Some kids , among them the curator's daughter , develop the bright idea of spending their Friday night in the museum's basement ( what can possibly be exciting about that ? ) and , naturally , they get killed by the djinn in various ways . End of story . The acting is horrible , possibly even among the WORST I've ever seen , and first-time director Tom Daley seems to leave out tension & atmosphere on purpose . The make up is even too cheesy to look charming and the romantic sub plots are intolerably tedious . One of the museum night guards sings opera songs during his shift until he gets speared . He's actually the most talented person involved in the whole production .

I mean hello , my name is Rugge ? err , call me by my initials R . D ! Okay Mr . R . D , what seems to be the problem ? Well the reviews on my latest movie " Dial : Help " were all negative and harsh and , frankly , I myself feel like my career has seen better days as well . Okay Mr . R . D , and why do you suppose that is ? Well , I gained fame and a well-deserved cult status thanks to my controversial and shocking movie about savage tribes of cannibals devouring a film crew and another one about relentless thugs terrorizing wealthy people in a house at the edge of the park , for which I borrowed the idea from Wes Craven , but " Dial : Help " revolves on ? err ? never mind ! No no , Mr . R . D , go ahead and tell me what the film is about . Um , it's about a spiritually possessed phone line stalking a sexy model and killing the people surrounding her . Ah , I see . That premise does indeed sound a little silly and not as petrifying as cannibals or rapists , but I suppose there are deeper themes in your film , right ? Oh yeah , sure ? Um , what do you mean by that ? Well , isn't the phone line symbolism for another kind of terror ? Or perhaps it's all just happening in the mind of your female heroine ? Um , nope ? It's just about a phone going berserk and murdering people with the cord , vibrations , electricity or even ordinary coins . Interesting , Mr . R . D , but how do you explain all this supernatural stuff to the viewer at the end of the movie ? You see , I figured the slowly unraveling phone-mystery plot wouldn't be that important or relevant , so I just concentrated on processing all possible phone-gimmicks I could think of . Phone gimmicks ? What do you mean ? You know , like wind blowing through the horn , mind-penetrating dial tones , and turn-tables catapulting into the air ! Very original , Mr . R . D , but not exactly horrific and as an experienced director you must know that , in the end , people expect a reasonable clarification of all these events . Oh , but there is ! It all has to do with negative and unreleased energy , if I remember correctly ! It's all a bit fuzzy , I admit . Hmm ? I see . Oh well , as they always say , a good motion picture relies on more elements than just the story . Did you at least process some of your regular trademarks into the film , so that your fans at least recognize your style ? I tried ! Lord knows I tried , but the murders and bloodshed are simply not shocking anyone ! That's a pity indeed , Mr . R . D , but what about sex ? Everyone likes a good portion of sleaze and nudity in their horror films and you said yourself the film centered on a sexy fashion model in peril ! Yes , but ? But what , Mr . R . D ? Well , to tell you the truth , we kind of promoted " Dial : Help " as an erotic thriller with revealing shots of Charlotte Lewis on the cover , but in reality there's no sex in the film and Charlotte even refused to go topless . Mr . R . D ! Now I'm really disappointed , that's just shamelessly ripping people off and lure them with false promises ! I know , I know , and I'm ashamed , but I just wanted everybody to rent " Dial : Help " and love it ! Well , to round up I can comfort you by saying that every major director is entitled to a few erroneous decisions without it affecting his / her career immediately , but be more cautious next time and do some research first , okay Mr . R . D ? I will ; thank you ! You're welcome . Tell me , have you got any ideas for upcoming movies already ? Yeah , as a matter a fact , I do ! I was thinking about making a Giallo with a murderous washing machine ! Doesn't that sound fascinating ? Hello ? Hello ?
405656	2020269	95812	2.0	Satan plays the fiddle !	Yup , here it is . . . another movie that wasted 80 minutes of my life . Paganini horror is a typical and meaningless horror movie . Nothing special , unoriginal and pretty annoying most of the time . It's the kind of movie that is hidden on the lowest shelf at your local videostore , covered in dust . There's a reason why it's down there , by the way . . . Although I do believe Paganini Horror has a bit of potential in it , it fails to show it on every possible level . The story is about a female rock band who uses the old Paganini mansion as the location for their newest video clip . Paganini was a violin player who once sold his soul to the Devil himself , in order to become world famous . Satan is still present in the house and he terrorizes everyone who dares to enter the mansion . . . Pretty dumb of course but some of the aspects that are related to Satan ( like playing the violin - - symphony of the dead ) prove that some tiny elements in this movie show potential . But you cannot believe how cheesy the special effects and the make-up in this movie look ! ! Blue flashy lights stand as most of the " horrific " effects and the blood shed is rather limited . Even though this movie was shot rather recent - in 1989 - it looks incredibly dated and above all cheap ! ! And I don't mean the charming kind of ' cheap ' . . . No , I mean the laughable and pathetic kind of cheap . The use of music is damn annoying as well . The stars are supposed to be talented singers and their hits are shown in the movie very detailed . Those are ideal " fast forward " - moments ! ! The songs suck and they don't really fit in a horror movie anyway . . . I keep on wondering how Donald Pleasance got involved in so many ludicrous horror productions ! ! This guy was such a great actor but he starred in so much crap ! Where does he find these roles ? Does his agent used to tell him stuff like : " Hey Donald , I've got another annoying Italian Cheese ball for you . . . interested ? " " Yeah sure , sign me up " It's really weird . . . I'd like to tell you his performance was the only positive aspect about Paganini Horror , but it's not . His acting is as terrible as the rest of the cast . Furthermore , the movie suffers from an amazingly stupid ending ! The ugliest girl survives and she has to face an utterly stupid plot twist . . . the poor thing . Anyway , you don't care about it anymore at that point . If you managed to sit through it till then , you'll laugh away the stupid ending as well . I always knew Satan was a musician . Can't really explain why but I always figured Him to be a violin player . It has a really spooky effect , if you ask me . . . That simple plot idea is the best thing this movie has to offer . I really advise you to skip it .
404914	2020269	91338	3.0	Sorority Girls just want to have fun ?	" Killer Party " is a pretty dumb and righteously forgotten mid-80's horror-comedy that only gets funny when it's meant to look serious and vice versa . That's quite painful already , and it gets gradually worse with bad acting and total lack of gore or inventive gimmicks . After not one , but TWO ( not even counting the super cheesy music video ) misleading opening sequences , we're introduced to three cheerful girl friends that desperately want to be part of a prominent campus sorority of which the name has already slipped my mind . They're accepted , but only because one of them ? Vivia ? is a master in pulling April fool's pranks . The girls are referred to as " goats " ( quite appropriately ) and they're assigned to freak out the boys of a frat club during a party held at a haunted frat house . What follows next is a series of lame red herrings disguised as fraternity pranks and a handful of bloodless killings , supposedly committed by a student who died in the house 20 years ago . Is it all a set-up ? Will the girls ever bath naked in the hot tub again ? Do we honestly even care ? ? With the exception of lead actress Elaine Wilkes ' portrayal of Phoebe , all the characters are completely insufferable and their deaths nearly weren't painful enough in my opinion . " Killer Party " is boring up until the last fifteen minutes , then it gets over-the-top campy and totally implausible . Not even the spirited guest appearance of Paul Bartel ( " Eating Raoul " , " Death Race 2000 " ) as the grumpy teacher can save this movie from being an utter mess . Check out " April Fool's Day " , instead .
405083	2020269	130487	3.0	Oh no ! ! Not Kentucky mountain hillbillies again !	It's a shame that this lovely site doesn't feature a poster image of this ' Geek ' , a . k . a Backwoods . The VHS copy I rented showed a mad-raving freak , waving around a butcher's hatchet . It attracts horror lovers and , in all honesty , I have to admit that the cover motivated me to rent it without knowing anything about it . Big mistake , of course ! Backwoods stands as one of the lousiest pieces of trash I ever beheld ? and that does mean something ! This film is a bloodless 80's slasher and that's about the worst idea possible . The makers clearly intended to bring tension and dept instead of blood and gore but they failed miserably . After an hour of viewing , you still haven't seen any of the cast-members dying ( unless you think decapitated chickens are gruesome ) . What other reasons do you have for seeing a slasher besides teen-butchering ? ? ? The heart-breaking story about a lone Kentucky farmer and his deranged son ? The thrilling adventures of a young couple camping ? The only aspect worth mentioning is the eerie opening / end credits song . The slowly sung and chilling lyrics give you the wrong impression that you're about to watch a good film . Check out ' Deliverance ' , ' The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ' , ' Just before Dawn ' , ' The Hills have Eyes ' or even Rick Roessler's ' Slaughterhouse ' instead ! Anything but this turkey !
405528	2020269	83019	3.0	The Godfather of Sleaze strikes again !	Generally speaking , I'm a an admirer of Jess Franco's film-making but , for some of this movies , I really have difficulties understanding the motivation behind them or even their reason of existence . Like this sick puppy , for example . " Sadomania " has absolutely no cinematic value , it's poorly made without any sort of plot and featuring some of the most ill-natured sleaze footage ever captured on film . This is another filthy women-in-prison film where rape , lesbian-action and violent torture games are daily routine . The guards are crazier than the prisoners and the institution is protected by an impotent governor who only gets sexually aroused when he spots a girl having sex with a dog ( ! ) . The girls are all very beautiful and naked throughout the entire film , yet you can't really enjoy this sight with all the perversion going on . The dubious highlights include a barbaric hunting game ( you can guess what he prey is ) , a duel-to-death between a guard and a prisoner and the image of a poor girl having a needle injected all the way through her nipple . Auch ! Avoid this sick mess and you'll save yourself the trouble of taking TWO baths in order to wash the filth off .
404714	2020269	74475	3.0	A painful miscarriage of a film . . .	First and foremost I'd like to state - for the record - that it's incredibly dumb to call your movie " Embryo " when the subject matter exclusively revolves on scientific research performed on fetuses ( animal as well as human ) aged 12-16 weeks . The embryonic stage is over at the end of the eighth pregnancy week and from that moment on the unborn critter enters the fetal phase . Okay , in all honestly , I didn't know all this , but I took the effort of looking it up and that's the also the least thing the creators of " Embryo " could have done . Don't worry ; I'm not just stumbling over details or being exaggeratedly bitter , as there are several more reasons to state why " Embryo " is a huge failure . Actual science can be considered as boring and inaccessible , and thus Science Fiction is a cinematic genre created especially to make the otherwise tedious , yet educational science topics more interesting and comprehensible to larger audiences . By depicting ambitious scientific experiments that go horribly wrong , or space missions that encounter evil aliens instead of light-years of void , filmmakers usually manage to entertain people with spectacular special effects and , at the same time , teach them useful little trivia about science . In order to make a good or at least halfway-decent Science Fiction movie , writers and directors only have to comply with one basic rule : DON'T be boring ! If they can't fulfill this one condition , the viewer might as well read a theoretically accurate book . Something must have gone wrong during the production of Ralph Nelson's " Embryo " . The basic premise is potentially fascinating and even involving , as we're all sensitive about saving the lives of unborn babies . There also were some very prominent names involved in the production , like main stars Rock Hudson ( " Giant " , " Seconds " ) , Diane Ladd ( " Chinatown " , " Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore " ) and director Nelson himself was responsible for the acclaimed classics " Soldier Blue " and " Charly " . Then what went wrong ? Simple . The script is irredeemably boring , clichéd and the whole thing looks incredibly foolish because the lab scenery & scientific equipment is clearly too primitive to achieve any medical breakthroughs with . Rock Hudson , in a very poor performance , plays a doctor who hasn't put any passion in his research work ever since his wife passed away . When his car hits a pregnant dog on a rainy night , his passion returns and he does everything possible to save the dying animals ' fetuses . He manages to keep one fetus alive , impressively accelerates its growth process and trains it to become an extremely intelligent dog . Because his procedure is so successful , Dr . Paul Holliston convinces his friend at the hospital to repeat his tests with the human fetus taken from the womb of a pregnant teenager who committed suicide . The female subject unexpectedly keeps growing at a fast rate , however , and after only a couple of weeks she's a full-grown , ravishing and super-intelligent woman . The good doctor naturally falls in love with her , but the groundbreaking new growth treatment also begins to show horrible side effects . . . Absolute nothing happens during the first 45 minutes of the film , apart from a lot of implausible and overly melodramatic mumbo-jumbo and one or two deeply impressive tricks performed by the dog . That second half of the film does contain a little bit of ( grotesque ) action and suspense , but by then the stupidity of the dialogs and the implausible plot-twists already ruined the potentially fabulous Sci-Fi idea . There are some really cool scenes , most notably the chess-showdown between Victoria and Roddy McDowall ( in a highly memorable and ultra-obnoxious supportive role ) . The grand finale is absurdly grotesque and literally on the verge of ridiculous , and it almost feels like Ralph Nelson put in that final disastrous shot because it was the general rule in contemporary thriller & Sci-Fi cinema . The last sequence , including the horrible freeze-frame shot at the end , certainly doesn't fit the tone of the previous 100 minutes of the film . But anyway , my sincere admiration and respect to the dog and his trainers . An animal with such intellect and talent surely deserved to demonstrate its tricks in a much better film .
406222	2020269	47149	3.0	An entire alien-race of Marty Feldmans ? ! ?	" Killers from Space " is cheap and silly but mainly boring 60's Sci-Fi that incomprehensibly escaped the attention of the genius MST3K-team . The film starts somewhat promising and there's an amusement peek near the middle , but overall it's pretty useless and forgettable . The only reason why some people still occasionally mention it is because of the most hilarious portrayal of extra-terrestrial life in the history of science fiction . The aliens ? or " killers " , as suggested in the title ? are ordinary humans , only they have exaggeratedly giant eyes that point in all possible directions . In fact , the aliens all strangely resemblance Marty Feldman ( ) , only they're meant to look like menacing monsters instead of legendary comedians . The rest of the plot is pretty unimportant , as you'll only have " eyes " for the alien monsters . But anyway : whilst doing nuclear testings in the Nevada desert , an eminent researcher disappears , only to show up again a couple of days later with a bad case of amnesia . Bit by bit , he remembers that he was temporarily abducted by weird aliens ( their eyes constantly developing because of the ever-growing darkness ) and they even carefully explained him why it's essential for them to eliminate humanity and take over our planet ! Of course , no one believes Dr . Douglas at first and he's even considered a fugitive criminal for a while , but he ends up saving the world ! Yay ! ! Pretty stupid movie , with almost no special effects and loads of wooden acting performances by an unknown cast . Luckily enough it's short and it also contains several " so bad it's good " moments . ( ) I absolutely don't mean any disrespect towards Marty Feldman . He was a great comedian and I totally loved his work .
405744	2020269	366174	3.0	Snakes ! But not on a plane . . .	Even though it came out much later than anyone expected ( seven years is an awful long time for a horror sequel ) , " Anacondas " has a whole lot in common with the first Anaconda movie that came out in 1997 . In fact , it's almost exactly the same movie . The creators even managed to find a replacement Latina actress for Jennifer Lopez and a villainous character that behaves almost as greedy and relentless as Jon Voight . I don't remember too much about the first " Anaconda " , except that a ridiculously over-sized snake destroyed the boat of an expedition crew and then subsequently ate them one by one . I'm sure that's all I can remember happening in " Anacondas : The Hunt for the Blood Orchid " too in a few days time . This is an extremely simplistic jungle adventure movie ( which kind of makes you wonder why there are seven different names listed in the writing credits ) with a poor excuse for a plot and a cast of characters that are textbook stereotypes . Bunch of people head out to Borneo in search for the blood orchid , or " the pharmaceutical equivalent to the fountain of youth " like some sleazy character refers to it , because apparently this very rare flower contains certain chemicals that form a life elixir . The bad news is that the orchid grows only for six months every seven years and the expedition is already running a bit late . The crew hires a macho boatman who thinks he's Crocodile Dundee and before they know it they all go face down into a waterfall and find themselves trapped in the middle of the dangerous jungle . Just to make things a tad bit more exciting , the crew doesn't just encounter one giant snake , but a whole bunch of them because it's mating season and then the slithering monsters tend to forgot they're supposed to be territorial animals . " Anacondas : Hunt for the Blood Orchid " is a pretty dumb movie , but at least it wasn't boring . It's rather pathetic to behold how everyone desperately tries to remain serious and straight-faced . The cast believes they are involved in some kind of creature feature masterpiece , whereas they should have just considered this as a campy B-movie experience and as a nice opportunity to overact terribly ; like John Voight did in the first " Anaconda " flick . The horror & suspense elements are truly lame . Anacondas swallow their preys in one whole piece . That is like one of the worst imaginable ways to die , so how come this fear isn't translated onto the screen ? And if the makers weren't interested in bringing suspense , then why aren't the snake-attacks gorier and cheesier ? There isn't even any sleaze or nudity ( just a lot of tame insinuations ) and several of the characters are really too cliché to tolerate . Hysterically screaming black guys and hot science chicks ? Oh , come on ! " Anacondas " is , simply put , an irritatingly pretentious yet insignificant flick with ? oh yeah , almost forgot ? terrible computer engineered effects . What they nowadays call an " epic fail " .
406035	2020269	157197	3.0	Talk about Bad Taste !	Bad-movie lovers , beware ? . Your standards will have to be set extremely low in case you want to remotely enjoy Herb Robins ' " The Worm Eaters " . This movie , produced by one of the über-gurus of crap cinema Ted V . Mikels ? is BEYOND bad ! It has an irredeemably dumb plot , a totally incoherent narrative structure , humorist elements that are horrid and horror elements that are painfully hilarious . It's easily one of the worst movies ever made , and it is truly incomprehensible how the hell it managed to build up a rather solid cult status over the years . Probably this exclusively has to do with the fact that Herb Robins insisted on using real , live worms for the on screen consumption . Much of the footage is just close-ups of people ( often with really terrible dental hygiene ) slurping down & chewing up worms , and the only goal is to disgust and gross-out the audience . Robins himself stars as the dim-witted hermit Umgar , living in a lakeside shed in a corrupted little town . He collects and breeds worms ? and then feeds them to his opponents , like the town's council members that want to evict him and reclaim the lake zone . The consumption of the worms somehow transforms people into man-worm hybrids . " The Worm Eaters " introduces a seemingly endless series of demented supportive characters and ? obviously ? all the actors and actresses overact incredibly . The make-up effects are pathetic , as the hybrid monsters are simply imbeciles tightly wrapped in filthy brown sleeping bags and desperately trying not to use their feet when they crawl through the mud . But , as wrong as it may sound , the film isn't entirely without merit and there really are a couple of positive elements . Like the goofy but cheerful theme music ( " You'll end up eating worms " ) , the creative animated opening credits and some of the gags that look like Benny Hill sketches . In conclusion , " The Worm Eaters " will undoubtedly one of the most bizarre low-budget , Z-grade schlock productions you'll ever encounter , so be careful who you recommend it to .
406167	2020269	82537	3.0	Humongous turkey !	This is one of those 80's slashers in which the teenagers are SO stupid that they really deserve to die , and it actually takes way too long until they get wiped out , if you ask me . The movie opens very promising , with a brutal rape-sequence on an island inhabited by a small community of people . This intro fools you into believing that you're about to see a relentless and misanthropic 80's gem . Immediately after this sequence , however , it goes straight downhill . 36 years later , five insufferable teenagers that washed ashore this same island , find out that the place is still inhabited by the cannibalistic offspring of the girl that was raped . Now , I THINK there were some gory death-scenes going on , only I couldn't see it because the photography varies from dark . . . to impenetrably dark ! Most of the playtime , you're just staring at a black screen and it's up to yourself to guess which one of the teenagers is being butchered . Not very interesting for a slasher . . . The sound effects are reasonably good and there's a handful of atmospheric moment . The same Canadian director also made " Prom Night " which is a lot better . When you eventually get to see the monstrous killer ( only briefly , mind you ) it exactly reflects the quality of the film : poor , pathetic and extremely disappointing .
405916	2020269	24787	3.0	Paltry but clever 30's thriller	Most of these 30's thrillers / murder mysteries have been forgotten by now because , let's face it , they haven't got much to offer apart from ? occasionally ? a good story . This little film has a very decent story , fluently written dialogues and some really adequate acting performances , yet it simple can't be called memorable because of the shabbiness of the production . Pat O'Brien ( " Hell's House " ) stars as an obtrusive reporter investigating the vicious assassination of a befriended District Attorney and unravels almost single-handedly an entire network of corruption , blackmail and political scandals . His performance is very good and he gets to say some very slick lines , yet the movie lacks a lot of action and continuity . There's one sequence near the beginning that I found particularly smart , showing how the assignment for murder is passed on to several involved parties and thus creating a complex structure that sadly never gets properly clarified . There are some more ingenious and dared ideas in the plot , but it all looks too poor for you to care . Feel free to avoid this one .
405595	2020269	82133	3.0	Some stories are better left . . . untold	I'm probably one of the few people in the world who don't automatically categorize Joe D'Amato's film as ' worthless ' or ' sleazy junk ' . No , I actually support the opinion that he's a filmmaker with vision . With films like ' Buried Alive ' , ' Death Smiles at Murder ' and ' Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals ' he proved that he's capable of combining gruesome horror images and gore with a compelling script . This film , however , completely takes the edge off the above stated opinion . Caligula : The Untold Story is a very ugly and mediocre film about history's most notorious figure . Following Tinto Brass ' controversial cult-epic , D'Amato focuses on the cruel and inhuman reign of the Roman emperor . This film particularly handles about a personal vendetta between a Moor-woman ( whose friend got brutally killed ) and the Emperor . She's torn between her personal feelings and her urge to take vengeance bla bla bla ? Caligula is a non-stop series of uninteresting sleaze , lame gore , terrible acting skills and inferior production values . The film starts out well enough , with a great cameo from Michele Soavi ( later the director of masterpieces like ' Dellamorte Dellamore ' ) trying to kill Caligula but , after this , it all goes downhill . David Cain is an incredibly bad actor and even the gorgeous Laura ' Black Emanuelle ' Gemser doesn't look sensual enough to keep you watching . This film reminded me a lot about history lessons in school . The substance is fascinating enough , but it's brought in such a tedious and dull way . You're way better of watching Brass ' epic staring Malcolm McDowell .
405428	2020269	59878	3.0	Let's DANCE !	What's the first thing to do when you and seven other friends crash your car into a road block and you're stuck in the mud ? Well , you DANCE ! What's your first reaction when you're attending a rock concert and all of a sudden two gigantically over-sized ducks come waddling in ? You start DANCING , of course . What's the very first thing you must accomplish when you and your friends grew up to a length of 30ft . after consuming a gooey unidentified substance ? Right again , you must DANCE ! I don't think the legendary bad movie director Bert I . Gordon ( BIG , for his friends ) ever intended to make a loyal adaptation of H . G . Well's novel " Food of the Gods " , he merely just wanted to make a light-headed and 60's spirit-capturing musical about the earliest Rock ' n Roll generations . " Village of the Giants " features an intolerably high amount of pointless padding sequences that simply show teenagers ? whether 30ft tall or not ? singing and dancing to Jack Nitzsche's ( admittedly catchy ) music and that's it . Thank God the film never at one point attempts to be a real scary and unsettling Sci-Fi movie , because that would have been really pathetic with all the lousy acting performances , tacky effects and the virtually non-existing screenplay . The annoying former child star Ron Howard portrays the nerdy kid-inventor Genius and accidentally discovers a substance that causes living creatures to grow to enormous proportions . A gang of naughty , outer town kids manage to steal a big slice of goo because they're sick and tired of being bossed around by adults . The adults probably just righteously stated they should waste less time on dancing and get a job ! The goody-two-shoes teenagers in town fight ( and go-go dance ) back , though ! What a totally demented movie this is . I wonder if Beau Bridges would like to be reminded of his role in this film as the nagging and totally uncharismatic leader of the bad pack . Presumably not ? And neither would Toni Basil and Ron Howard . However , it must be interesting to see an X-rated version of this film , since all of the girls are quite beautiful ( particularly Joy Harmon ) and literally bursting out of garments as they feed on the substance . " Village of the Giants " is never suspenseful or interesting , with the exception of one notably engaging gargantuan tarantula scene , and manages to be quite boring despite the short running time . Jack Nitzsche's theme music was obviously brilliant , because no less than Quentin Tarantino borrowed the song " The Last Race " for his own recent grindhouse movie " Death Proof " . Worth a peek in case you're a fan of horribly bad low-budget 60's stuff or in case you have a strange & inexplicable admiration for director / writer Bert I . Gordon , like I have .
406378	2020269	118643	4.0	Gabriel : The Terminating Angel	Everybody knows that Gregory Widen's original " The Prophecy " didn't really require a sequel , but you also don't need a degree in rocket science hanging above your chimney to realize that further cash-ins on this profitable horror concept were inevitable . Part two is a very prototypic example of a straight-to-video sequel , meaning the creative and convoluted plot of the original has been simplified a lot in favor of more action , more witty one-liners and a lot more eerie religious scenery . The only good news is that the producers managed to keep Christopher Walken for the role of Gabriel , and he delivers another gloriously brazen performance that promptly justifies the price of a rental . If it wasn't for Walken's performance ( and perhaps a couple of players in the supportive cast like Brittany Murphy and Glenn Danzig ) , " The Prophecy II " surely would have disappeared into oblivion straight after its release . The movie begins with Gabriel literally getting spat out of hell to proceed with his ongoing War of Heaven here on earth . The purpose of his battle this time is to prevent the baby of nurse Valerie Rosales ( Jennifer Beals ) from getting born . For you see , her unborn child is the first ever hybrid between a heavenly angel and an earthly " monkey " and the birth of such a superior being would imply the downfall of Gabriel's evil dominion . Thus , just as in the first movie , he engages a suicidal accomplice to assist him and hunts Valerie all the way down to the Eden for the final showdown . " The Prophecy II " is an endurable and occasionally even entertaining movie as long as you don't make comparisons with the original and as long as you manage to overlook the multiple plot holes and errors in continuity . Whenever the storyline becomes too tedious , the makers luckily enough always insert a near-brilliant Christopher Walken moment to distract you . His interactions with the rebellious Izzy and particularly his ignorance regarding modern earthly technologies often result in worthwhile and memorable sequences . On a slightly off-topic note , I often felt like " The Prophecy II " ambitions to look similar to " Terminator II " ? Gabriel's resurrection looked somewhat like the teleportation of a futuristic cyborg and the Eden location , where the final battle takes place , looks very similar to the steel factory where " Terminator II " ended as well . Coincidence , I guess ? Overall , this is an inferior and passable sequel but still worth checking out in case you're a fan of Christopher Walken's unique acting charisma ( and who isn't ? ) .
406058	2020269	118615	4.0	Big Snake Yawn .	It's pretty damn difficult to impress even the most enthusiast and undemanding horror audiences with a 40 ft . long animatronic snake that ? apart from looking silly ? also screams at its victims . And yet , strangely enough , the CGI effects & visuals are actually the most pleasing aspects to endure whilst watching " Anaconda " . The hopelessly muddled script and the awful performances ( coming from a prominent ensemble cast , I may add ) form the real disaster here . This could have been a pretty cool big animal creature-feature IF ONLY the creators tried a to make it look less like big-budgeted studio blockbuster and more like an unpretentious and cheesy B-movie ! Jon Voight surely seemed to think he was involved in such a production , as his performance is permanently over-the-top and almost deliberately bad . Voight blinks ridiculously all the time and talks in an unidentifiable accent , while the rest of the cast attempts to speak their lines straight-faced and plausible . It's almost pitiful to behold . A seven-headed film crew sails down the mighty Amazon river , hoping to shoot a breakthrough documentary about a nearly extinct tribe of natives . Instead of primitive savages , they encounter a stranded adventurer who claims to know all the dangers of the Amazon jungle and offers to be their guide . Patiently and strategically , he ( Paul Sarone ) directs the crew towards the territory of the horrific man-eating anaconda . After ( far too ) many lame and predictable false alarm sequences , the big computer-engineered snake finally begins to reduce the number of passengers on the boat . The grotesque action sequences are okay , I guess , but the interactions between the stereotypical characters are totally unbelievable . Eric Stolz ( as the expedition's leader ) lies unconscious most of the time , Ice Cube stares at the animals in the jungle as they were his gangster enemies from the ghetto , Owen Wilson looks like he wants to ride the anaconda as it was a rodeo-bull and ? worst of all ? Jonathan Hyde plays the obnoxious British chap who even carries on golfing after several people have died . As strange as it sounds , Jennifer Lopez honestly plays the most convincing character and gives away the best performance . The plot meanders needlessly and contains several situations that are stupid and inexplicable , like unnatural barricades in the middle of the godforsaken jungle and dynamite-induced snake showers . Luis Llosa's direction is uninspired but at least Bill Butler's camera captures some enchanting images of the South American jungles . Despite having appeared in over 40 movies already , Danny Trejo's role is just a miserable cameo .
405952	2020269	73836	4.0	Well intended , but painfully bad " revenge " - rip off . . .	Well , I was planning to provide this review with the title " Last Train on the Left " but that seems to be a pretty obvious choice . Nighttrain Murders tries to pick in on the success of Wes Craven's milestone as close as possible . They even managed to find a main villain resembling David Hess , who played the merciless bastard in Craven's film . The film means well and all but , it just lacks the budget , talent and inspiration to become of any importance . The entire first hour ( in which two girls travel to Italy by train , in order to celebrate the Holiday season ) completely lacks suspenseles or depth and it seems to be endless . Eventually , the girls are being humiliated and tortured by two madmen and a nympho-bitch . From then on , everything goes rather quickly and , before you know it , the father of one of the girls already avenged the death of his daughter . Totally " Last House on the Left " in other words . . . only less fascinating and only half as disturbing . Although it looks like a sleazy Italian production , the film hasn't got much violence or bloodshed in it . One scene is pretty disgusting to watch and you'll recognize which one I mean immediately . Besides that , it's nothing more but a waste of a terrific musical score by Ennio Morricone . Avoid ! Unless your a fan of rare cult stuff of course .
405918	2020269	83658	4.0	The Future is mean , ugly . . . and rather dull .	Well , I guess I must have totally missed the point again . . . I did not see a Sci-Fi masterpiece with astonishingly progressive visual effects and a flawlessly adapted screenplay , but an over-ambitious and difficult to digest drama epic with a lack of action . But hey , " Blade Runner " is ranked pretty high in the IMDb top 250 and all the professional reviews are singing praise , so my humble opinion is probably something you shouldn't bother to read . Although , for the record , the only version I've seen is the original theatrical version and ? supposedly ? only the 1992 director's cut version is a genuine masterpiece . Unquestionably terrific is Ridley Scott's portrayal of our world by the year 2019 , when the cities look exactly like predicted in Fritz Lang's " Metropolis " with immense 300-storey skyscrapers and pure decay down below on the streets . The future is ugly and petrifying and it looks like nobody can smile anymore . In this sad and unappealing universe , Rick Deckard is an early retired " Blade Runner " whose duty was to eliminate android fugitives , called Replicants , that escaped from extraterrestrial colonies . Deckard is called back because four of the most dangerous Replicants are on an earthly mission to increase their miserable life-span of only four years . The film's biggest disappointment ? other than the tiresome voice over by Ford and the dreadful jazzy soundtrack ? are the characterizations of these android Replicants . Supposedly they're relentless villains that already made over 30 casualties on their way over to earth , yet when they're face to face with their enemies ? humans ? they don't look the least bit menacing or dangerous at all ! Neither do they evoke feeling of understanding or sympathy , they just behave like philosophical talkers ; especially the " leader " Roy Batty . The love-story sequences between Ford and robotic beauty Sean Young feel like pure melodramatic padding whereas sublime actors in intriguing supportive roles ( M . Emmet Walsh , Edward James Olmos ) are criminally underused . The film may be rich on themes and symbolism , but the lack of excitement is saddening and the ending is unforgivably weak .
404542	2020269	424855	4.0	Not that bloody and definitely not that " deep " . . .	I had really hoped to come here with the announcement that the slasher sub-genre is NOT dead ? That there still are enthusiast young directors with bright ideas and a passion for vicious gore or insane plot twists . " Blood Deep " surely looked like such a promising new horror project but , alas , it disappoints . The story revolves on a gang of childhood friends that come together for a reunion at the parental house of pivot character Kate . During a random hypnosis game , one of them suddenly confesses to a murder that was committed in the area over 20 years ago . The synopsis really appealed to me as it reminded me of classic films like " Stand By Me " or Stephen King's " It " , only with a genuine slasher-twist ! Unfortunately , Todd S . Kniss ( cool name , though ) makes the mistake of introducing too many characters and dedicates too much of his time on detailed but unnecessary character drawings . Creating a background or building up atmosphere is good , but " Blood Deep " eventually features too many pointless flashbacks and dead-end story lines . Then , when the long-awaited killing spree breaks loose , the story regretfully reverts to old clichés and predictable situations . Every character has his / her own repressed trauma or hidden teenage crush that comes to the surface during the reunion . The murder sequences are tame ( sometimes even off-screen , God forbid ! ) and the whole film remains politically correct at all times , which was quite a letdown . Perhaps in order to attain wider audiences , Kniss put a lot of effort in stylish cinematography and a creative use of light . He definitely isn't a bad director , also since the entire cast deliver above-average performances and the choice of music is effectively creepy . Maybe " Blood Deep " was just wrongly promoted ? With a slightly less gruesome sounding title and a more coherent plot , this could have been an acceptable psychological thriller . On a totally unimportant side note : I saw this film at the Belgian horror festival and supportive actress Kelci B . Lowry came along to introduce it . Let me assure you she's one gorgeous looking angel with a smile that nearly makes you melt in your seat .
405867	2020269	330691	4.0	New-age giallo without surprises . Where's the blood and gore , Dario ? ? ?	I think even the most fanatic Argento fans will agree that the 90's was a rather disappointing decade for the Italian horror maestro . Both ' Trauma ' and ' The Stendal Syndrome ' were below his normal standards and ' Phantom of the Opera ' was simply bad . But the new millennium seemed to bring back Dario's inspiration and he gave us ' Sleepless ' . I love that film ? the violence is outrageous and the plot is deliciously absurd . ' Sleepless ' was an authentic giallo and it made me anticipate the release of ' The Card Player ' with great expectations ? Well , I regret saying Argento's latest film is yet another minor disappointment . It feels like watching a routine , made-for-TV thriller and the typical Argento touches are nowhere to detect . And worst of all ? it's as good as bloodless ! I couldn't believe my eyes when I noticed when some of the murders were shown in swift , unclear flashes ! Some of them even happened off-screen and that's the last thing I expect in an Italian horror shocker . Dario Argento does move with the times , though ! The screenplay of his latest giallo involves online gaming , web cams , forensic examinations and sell phone text messages . There's a killer on the loose in Rome . He kidnaps girls and offers policewoman Anna Mari the opportunity to save their lives by playing online poker games with him . Since the first victim was a British tourist , Anna teams up with the tough John Brennan who works as a police officer for the British embassy . Granted , during several sequences , Argento manages to create suspense and he still knows how to uphold an unsettling tone . But the plot is far too thin and the twists are predictable . It doesn't require a degree in rocket science to figure out what's going on and even the killer's identity isn't a real mystery . Dario Argento is mostly known as a giallo-director . Gialli form a unique sub-genre because of their complex structure and far-fetched plot-twists . And , not to forget , because of the mad-raving gore sequences and perverted sexual undertones . The Card Player totally lacks all these elements .
406209	2020269	96071	4.0	Love the scenery ? and the make-up !	Bill Pullman plays a Harvard anthropologist who's sent to Haiti in order to investigate the process of ' zombification ' . Haitian voodoo-priests and sorcerers have developed a method to bring the dead back to live again and have control over their souls . The ' civilized ' medicine world is interested in this method to use it as some sort of tranquillizers before operating on patients . It doesn't take long before Pullman gets caught in a web of voodoo-spells and curses ? . I'm not a giant fan of director Wes Craven . The Serpent and the Rainbow surely is the most original and ambitious film of his career , but I feel like he lacks a little talent to make a memorable movie out of it . The script is often confusing and difficult to follow while Craven's usual style is simple and only meant to shock and entertain . Nonetheless , this film surpasses the average 80's horror level thanks to its inspired locations and often-gruesome make-up effects . The dark , mysterious Haitian graveyards at night look very spooky and Craven's zombies are quite terrifying . The topics of Voodoo and the living dead form a good plot outline for a compelling horror tale , but I would have preferred another director for this . Bill Pullman is a good lead and he gets excellent feedback from the often-overlooked actor Paul Winfield . While browsing through this site , I learned that Winfield sadly past away very recently on the 7th of March ? May he rest in peace and hopefully the voodoo priests will leave his soul at ease .
406131	2020269	109327	4.0	Game over , already . . . Igor is the winner !	Dumb , dumb . . . dumb horror movie ONLY enjoyable IF you manage to totally ignore the whole concept that is . . . . well . . . rather dumb ! " Brainscan " is the name of a hi-tech video game that places the player inside the mind of a serial killer . Bound to a time-limit , Michael Bower ( Edward Furlong ) has to commit a motiveless murder without leaving evidence or witnesses . All very exciting , of course , until the next morning when Michael finds out that ? surprise surprise ? a real murder took place in his neighborhood , identical to the one he interactively committed . Overcome with fear and denial , he loses all contact with the outside world and becomes more and more dependent on Trickster ; the sinister host of the game . Despite being such a ? oh yes ? dumb film , this " Brainscan " is rather well-made and involving . The eerie tune is excellent , the opening sequences ( showing Michael's returning nightmare of his mother dying in a road-accident ) is atmospheric and the supportive characters are smoothly drawn . I particularly liked Frank Langella's cop-character Hayden . He's a fatigue man who refers to Michael as the class-misfit and never raises the tone of his voice , not even when the killer eventually stands in front of him . The visual effects were too hectic for me , but there is some good old-fashioned low budget gore and sharp black humor . The absolute best gimmick of the entire production , however , is Michael's computer-engineered butler named Igor ! This guy is great ! ! He answers to every command with a monotonous " Yes , master " and he even constantly repeats the message : " Master is busy . . . Master is busy " , when Michael to wishes to hold all calls . I have got to get me one of those ! Anyway , back to the movie : The climax is an obvious giveaway and it only states what everybody already knows . Gamers generally are mentally weak people with difficulties to have mature friendships or relations , ha ha . " Brainscan " is a horror movie especially intended for the Playstation-generation , so you better dispose of a healthy dose of humor in case you're not in this target group . Oh , did I already mention it was rather dumb ? ? Special kudos goes out to actress Amy Hargreaves who supposedly portrays a 16-year-old high-school sweetheart , while in reality 24 years of age already .
406509	2020269	69753	4.0	Kiss Me , Kill Me . . . Annoy Me ?	Psychedelic soft-erotic exploitation movies were an inexplicably popular trend amongst European directors back in the late 60's and early 70's . This generally pointless sub genre of horror consists of movies that basically don't have any plots , but are stuffed with trendy looking women parading around naked and fetishist escapades that all healthy heterosexual males are supposed to fantasize about . Yeah , right ? I don't know about you , but I surely never dreamed of sadomasochistic rubber dolls or Nazi elimination squads . The list of these oddball movies is long and contains efforts from several acclaimed directors , like Mario Bava's " Lisa and the Devil " , Jess Franco's " Succubus " , Massimo Dallamano's " Venus in Furs " , Umberto Lenzi's " Orgasmo " and Piero Schivazappa's " The Laughing Woman " . " Baba Yaga " also fits into this category , but here the script was inspired by an eccentric comic books series courtesy of Guido Crepax . Basically this means that " Baby Yaga " is even weirder and more flamboyant than all the other psychedelic sex flicks mentioned here above . During a live and personal presentation of his film , at a festival in my home country Belgium , director Corrando Farina explained that he tried to translate as many comic book elements to the screen as possible , but that it certainly wasn't easy due to budgetary restriction and uncooperative producers and censorship . Still , no matter what Farina claims , nothing can divert the attention away from the fact that " Baba Yaga " is a dull and utterly incoherent movie . I didn't spot any artistic style elements at all and the hallucinogenic footage is just a bunch of randomly scraped together and irrelevant sleaze . Isabelle De Funès ( Louis ' yummy niece , apparently ) stars as a liberated photographer in Milan . Late one night and following only a brief encounter , she reluctantly becomes the object of obsession of the funnily named lesbian witch Baba Yaga ( Carroll Baker ) . The deranged hag turns Valentina's camera into a murder device , transfigures her best friend into an SM-doll , inflicts eerie nightmares on her and eventually lures the poor girl to an abandoned mansion with nasty sewing machines and bottomless pits . In case you're looking for significance , symbolism or possibly even an explanation , I'm afraid I have to discourage you straight away . Everything that happens in " Baba Yaga " happens for absolutely NO reason and the film finishes just as void as it begun . To round up with at least a couple of positive remarks , I really liked the music and both Isabella De Funès and Ely Galleani are stunningly beautiful ladies to look at . George Eastman ( as the heroine's clueless boyfriend ) is good too , but I definitely prefer the roles he played in his later career as they were practically all villainous .
406430	2020269	490076	4.0	Dump the Broad , damned !	I was only cautiously enthusiast when renting " All the boys love Mandy Lane " , as I instantly remembered hearing & reading a wide variety of opinions ? both positive and negative ? in the short period of time between its brief cinematic release and the distribution towards videostore shelves . Supposedly this was the most ingenious and refreshing new horror film in years , with non-stereotypical teen characters and unpredictable plot twists for a change . Okay , the basic concept may perhaps sound reasonably innovative but inevitably the screenplay quickly reverts to the same old and irritating slasher clichés , and once passed that point even the nifty stylistic trademarks can't save the film from dreadful mediocrity . The opening sequences are indeed terrific and literally bath in a moodily melancholic ambiance , which actually makes it all the more painful to witness the film sink towards the " ordinary " level of rudimentary slasher flick . After the sublime intro , showcasing a drunk macho kid miscalculate his jump off a rooftop in order to impress the titular beauty , " All the Boys Love Mandy Lane " turns out to be just another textbook and uninspired horror movie about a bunch of idiotic kids getting stoned and horny on a secluded ranch before getting killed off by a not-so-unidentified maniac . The film's entire pretentious set-up collapses faster than a ramshackle house of cards : we never get a proper explanation why Mandy herself behaves so frigid and haughty towards all her admirers ( because she grew up an orphan , perhaps ? Oh , boo-hoo ) , the boys soon enough illustrate they'd settle for sex with any random bimbo and not exclusively with the " divine " Mandy and the final twist ? albeit undeniably offbeat ? is just plain senseless . The middle section of is rather boring and doesn't even offer any genuinely horrific excitement ( shotgun killings ? Please ! ) or authentic rancid sleaze . My generous rating entirely goes to the grainy and unsettling 70's filming style ( with faded colors , bizarre but beautiful photographic images ? ) and the surprisingly marvelous soundtrack . Director Jonathan Levine opted for the classic Bobby Vinton song " Sealed with a Kiss " to play during the trailer and end-credits , whereas I initially was convinced the film would inevitably feature Barry Manilow's cheesy love-song " Mandy " .
404411	2020269	126604	4.0	Bring back the John Waters of " Pink Flamingos " and " Polyester "	John Waters became a cult-cinema hero in the 70's instantly after delivering the bad-taste milestone " Pink Flamingos " and he continued pleasing his trash-horny fans ( including me ) with extraordinary and incomparable movies like " Female Trouble " , " Desperate Living " and " Polyester " . True , Waters ' movies were offensive , shocking and often repulsive but they simultaneously were unique outsiders in an overall politically correct American film industry . Nearly twenty years later , there's very few ingeniousness left inside Water's mind and it also looks like he has developed morality and grew a consciousness . He still pretends to be controversial by portraying his beloved Baltimore as an antipathetic wasteland where the people are shameless and eccentric , but he sure ain't provoking anybody . The plot of " Pecker " is very ordinary and basically just a reworking of two of the oldest ' lessons ' in storytelling . 1 ) success and wealth do not equal happiness and 2 ) home sweet home . . . even if it is Baltimore ! Pecker works in a snack bar but he merely is obsessed by photography and spends his days stalking friends , family and neighbors with a camera as the extension of his eyes . During a local presentation , he's discovered by a fancy New York art dealer and , all of a sudden , every eminent art critic is interested in Pecker's portrayal of the ' culturally challenged ' ( like described beautifully in the film ) models . The dialogs are dull , the script is unoriginal and most gags are so tasteless that they seem to come straight out of a Farrelly-brothers movie ( sex in a cubicle ? ) . The acting isn't very good neither and especially Christina Ricci was a bad choice to play the neurotic laundry-shrew . Thank God there also are some positive things to mention ! The little Chrissy character , for example , Pecker's hyperactive and sugar-addicted kid sister . Or the " shopping for others " game , which really looks like fun .
404736	2020269	82620	4.0	Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Daddies . . .	Here's another gloriously absurd and grotesque horror movie concept that only could have sprung from the mind of delirious early 80's scriptwriters . Dig this : A father and his two psychically and telekinetic gifted children lives isolated atop of a mountain , because daddy is worried the government will come and kidnap the children for examination . One day , however , the happy family receives a visit from a gang of nasty biker thugs and they kill daddy right in front of the children . Rather than to use their powers to rescue him , Beth and Michael prefer to resurrect his corpse later on and employ it as a tool of vengeance against the bikers . Meanwhile a social worker ( Marilyn Burns of " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " ) and the new local deputy ( Fabian Forte the singer ) attempt to visit the family without finding it strange the father is never available . " Kiss Daddy Goodbye " is likely to be the only movie ever in which children toy around with one of their deceased parents and even instruct him to dig his own grave . However , this ultra morbid storyline aspect is probably the only reason to check out this otherwise boring , unexciting and amateurishly put together film . The death sequences are dull and bloodless , the pacing is intolerably slow and the acting performances of the entire cast rank among the worst I've ever seen in 80's horror ; and that is saying quite a lot . Especially the child actors are terrible , but they are director Patrick Regan's offspring and they look exclusively modeled after the uncanny kids of " Village of the Damned " . Apparently only cute-faced kids with white hair and pale skins are allowed to have telepathic powers . This rare and curious piece of 80's trash is probably not worth tracking down , but still I can't say I regret having seen it . There's a certain something about this movie which fellow cult fanatics will notice and appreciate as well .
405295	2020269	324127	4.0	Engagement and Plausibility Below Zero	" Suspect Zero " is an endurable and occasionally compelling suspense-thriller , but with a far too ambitious and implausible concept , too many unprocessed sub plots and character drawings that easily rank among the least likable ones I ever saw . If this project ever had the intention of becoming the 2000's equivalent of serial killer classics such as " Seven " and " The Silence of the Lambs " ( like multiple reviews claim it had ) , well then it failed miserably . The basic idea of the film would perhaps have worked better in a near-futuristic and politically different climate , for example in the same setting and era as " Minority Report " and " I , Robot " . Without revealing too much , the plot hints at themes that are pure Sci-Fi , like unorthodox methods to brain-train FBI agents into hunting down serial killers , but at the same time the events take place in a nowadays setting . I think the sequences in which both protagonists supernaturally " witness " hallucinating things and note down seemingly unclear clues could be convincing in a not-so-distant future , but not yet in this day and age and certainly not in the New Mexican middle-of-nowhere . Tough copper Thomas Mackelway gets transferred to a small Albuquerque precinct after violating several procedures in order to apprehend a serial killer . There , he instantly receives strange faxes and bizarre visions about murders that are committed all over the country . It seems as if a super intelligent serial killer ? specializing in killing other serial killers ? wants to involve Mackelway into his hunt for the ultimate serial killer , the so-called Suspect Zero who never gets caught because he doesn't have a fixed modus operandi . This pretty much is the plot in a nutshell , but the film unfolds slightly more convoluted like that , believe me . " Suspect Zero " seriously lacks panache in practically all the important departments . The main character Thomas Mackelways is a stone-cold and antipathetic individual , so you honestly don't care too much about his troubles in the past or his devastating hunt for the killer . At some points , the plot seems to try and emotionally link him to two female characters ( his partner Fran and one local Albuquerque assistant ) but that never goes anywhere . Ben Kingsley gives a strong performance as always , but his character O'Ryan is simply too unreal and awkward . Since the actual hunt for the Suspect Zero killer is too implausible , the suspense-highlights of the film include the digging up facts regarding the other three serial killers . Sadly enough , those sequences are too brief . " Suspect Zero " is also listed as a horror film , but there's very little ( on screen ) carnage . Admittedly some of the themes are potentially disturbing , but there's too little excitement shown on screen . Overall , a disappointment , but nonetheless an interesting film to watch once .
404624	2020269	82818	4.0	Semi-successful maniacal portrait . . .	First and foremost : I feel they ought to make " Nightmare in a Damaged Brain " the official title of this movie . It has got such a cool ring to it , and simply calling it " Nightmare " is insignificant anyways ! That said . . . on with the review ! Scavolini's film actually is a decent film and not quite as disgusting as you might fear . It sort of follows into the footsteps of " Maniac " and mixes bloody massacres with a more deeper portrait of a deranged psycho . The intelligent plot-aspects regretfully are poorly elaborated and this causes a lack of tension , involvement and a slow rate . Too bad , because the genuinely creepy opening sequence increased my expectations . Baird Clifford ( a completely unknown and unexperienced actor ) plays a terrific lead , though ! His diabolical charisma really fits his character well and - occasionally - you could even compare his portrayal with what Michael Rooker did for " Henry : Portrait of A serial Killer " . A very strong advantage , but it just can't save the film from oblivion . Would I still recommend it ? Yes , I do . . . even if it were only to see Tom Savini's great work in the make-up department . There's some sick violence featuring in this film that'll certainly appeal to gorehounds .
405088	2020269	63595	4.0	Feels like a Russ Meyer film but without the cleavage . . .	This angry female-biker flick was my first acquaintance with the legendary director Hershell Gordon Lewis . I'm much more looking forward to seeing some of his most controversial films like ' Two Thousand Maniacs ' , ' Blood Feast ' or ' The Gruesome Twosome ' but I consider this to be a reasonable appetizer . It's not nearly as shocking or offensive as it might look and the script contains very few material to make a movie of . Loud-mouthed bitches who drink and race all day , while they consider all males to be ? mothers ! They live by strange rules ( for example : when you donate too much attention to the same guy , you're out of the group ) and organize orgies with a cabin full of studs ! A couple of persons get severely mutilated and one of them even loses his head but , other than this , there isn't much gore or action to detect . Best aspects about this film actually are the sleazy-sounding title and the opening song , entitled ' Get off the Road ' . Lewis ' She-Devils on Wheels is a very campy film ! Some of the dialogue is really hilarious , but almost literally impossible to understand . This film decently represents the she-exploitation subgenre . But not nearly as good as Russ Meyer's legendary ' Faster Pussycat , Kill ! Kill ' which was made 3 years earlier . The shrews in this particular film were a lot meaner , relentless and ? most importantly ? sexier .
406182	2020269	70537	5.0	This little piggy stayed at home and watched a demented drive-in feature ?	Ladies and Gentlemen , the hall of 70's exploitation obscurity proudly presents " Pigs " , a movie made by , made for and ? of course ? largely revolving on ? Pigs ! Just in case you're looking for a totally incompetent yet strangely fascinating and one of a kind drive in class-sick , I warmly recommend this movie which Marc Lawrence ( supportive cast member of such acclaimed classics as " Key Largo " and " The Asphalt Jungle " ) wrote , produced , starred in and directed entirely by himself ! " Pigs " , which is a much easier and equally appropriate title to use instead of the official " Daddy's Deadly Darling " , blends two main story lines that are typical 70's exploitation guff ( meaning : absurd and utterly tasteless ) , yet the wholesome feels refreshing and unique . The opening sequences introduce Lynn Webster . She's a beautiful and impressively voluptuous young girl who has just slain her father because he couldn't keep his hands to himself and a certain other body part inside his pants . One minor problem , however , Lynn refuses to accept her daddy is dead and she even escapes from the asylum to search for him . Why she desperately wants to be reunited with the guy who physically abused her is just one of the many weird kinks in the plot that remains unexplained and neglected . I guess it's because she's mentally unstable and those people tend to desire weird things . Anyway , she arrives at a remote countryside diner where funny farmer Zambrini employs her as a waitress . Zambrini has a couple of issues of his own , though . To a corpse he stole from the local morgue he explains how his pigs accidentally developed a taste for human blood . It started when they devoured a drunkard who fell asleep in their barnyard , but now they exclusively crave human flesh . The rest of the film is pure but amusing nonsense , with Lynn gradually losing whatever's left of her sanity and Zambrini desperately collecting corpses to keep his porkers satisfied . Jesse Vint stars as the handsome Sheriff investigating the odd events at Zambrini's farm and , like any other male character , he falls for Lynn's gorgeous rack . " Pigs " guarantees 80 minutes of uncompromising and demented ' Rednecksploitation ' fun ! Naturally it's a horrible film , complete with amateurish acting performances and dialogs that appear to have been written by the pigs , but trained admirers of cinematic 70's smut won't be able to resist it . The camera-work looks hideous , Marc Lawrence clearly never heard of editing and the make-up effects wouldn't even scare a child . " Pigs " also features a misfit but incredibly catchy theme song called " Somebody's Waiting For You " ( misfit songs were almost obligatory in 70's drive-in classics ) and the endlessly repeated " La la lalalla la la " tunes . Marc Lawrence donated the role of Lynn to his real-life daughter Toni , presumably to launch her career . It must have been awkward , for the both of them , to shoot all the sequences where she wears a revealing and too tight nightgown . Do I sense incestuous undertones ? Sure , why not ? Everything goes in the wondrously twisted world of 70's exploitation , right ?
405745	2020269	65217	5.0	The DARK swamps of witchcraft	I am definitely giving this movie another chance , IF it ever receives a proper DVD release complete with restored sound and polished up picture quality . I couldn't really enjoy my viewing of " The Witchmaker " , but most likely that was due to the questionable quality of the VHS-rip rather than the actual movie . I found myself staring at a black screen most of the time , yet in between all the vagueness it was obvious that this movie is worthwhile enough to deserve a decent DVD edition . Unfortunately that still doesn't mean it's a great film . " The Witchmaker " is merely a hodgepodge of good conceptual ideas , outstanding locations & scenery , ominous atmospheres and genuinely spooky images , but sadly the script is massively incoherent and several of the plot's details aren't elaborated to the fullest . The main trump is undoubtedly the grisly swamp setting ! I used to think the British countryside had a monopoly on forming the ideal setting for stories about witchcraft and devil-worshiping ( " Blood on Satan's Claw " and " The Witchfinder General " are two prime examples ) , but that was before I saw the same story set in the Louisianan bayou region ! The area looks as good as impenetrable and feels genuinely inescapable and isolated . At a certain point in the story , the remaining survivor characters desperately want to get out the swamp ? and who could blame them ? but it simply isn't possibly because their cabin is only reachable by boat and the boatman one passes by per week . Even in remote rural Britain they didn't have that problem ! Several beautiful young girls have been murdered in the Bayou over the last few years , and the macabre modus operandi leads to suspect there's a coven witches active in the area . The corpses are hung upside down from a tree and there are eerie symbols painted on their naked bodies . The murders are indeed the work of a dude named Luther the Berserk , a master of Sabbath , who needs the women's blood for his occult rituals . Alvy Moore plays paranormal detective Ralph Hayes who travels to the area to research the murders . One of the expedition members tagging along is the indescribably beautiful Thordis Brandt and her character is the granddaughter of an actual witch ! Hayes dragged her aboard because she's more sensitive to paranormal activity , but Luther also notices her talents and promptly sets up a plan to recruit her as his own witch . Okay , we have a splendid setting , a plot with the utmost potential AND a number of disturbing moments ( I swear , the sights of those naked and smeared girls ' bodies are positively unnerving ) , so what's the problem ? I'm really not sure , but fact is that " The Witchmaker " doesn't quite live up to its own potential . The suspense building is too often undercut by seemingly endless psychologist conversations and occult gibberish . The film is just too talkative and , like another reviewer stated already , the characters drink way too much coffee , which is probably the reason why they keep talking and talking and talking ! The first twenty minutes ( up until Brandt's semi-topless run through the swamp ) as well the finale are pure fascinating horror stuff , but it's difficult to stay focused throughout the tedious and uneventful middle section . Nonetheless , " The Witchmaker " is a very interesting American witchcraft / Satanist movie and honestly deserves to be slightly more known among genre fanatics .
405567	2020269	325534	5.0	Surf to : www . killyourbaby . com	A handful of pregnant ladies die on exactly the fifteenth day after they all visited the website of an uncanny abortion-clinic . Doesn't that concept sound familiar ? Sure , it involved watching old-fashioned videotapes and dying in only seven days , but the basic idea of " Ringu " is shamelessly imitated here in this uninspired but still very competently made South-Korean chiller . To carry on with the plot description : all the victims claimed to have ' seen themselves dying online ' and , when the corpses are found , the uterus's are immensely stretched as if they just gave birth to a baby . Investigating the case are a cyber-police officer and a female TV-reporter who ? unfortunately for her ? clicked on the site herself . The story of " Unborn but Unforgotten " offers absolutely no surprises , but it's still worth watching in case you're a fan of Asian horror cinema , if it were only to admire the director's style and the cinematography . The atmosphere is dark and often scary even though there's nothing going on , really . There surely are a lot of holes in the plot ( big ones , too ) , but the film nevertheless holds your attention because the main characters are likable , especially the girl , and because multiple images are just plain creepy ! The music and acting performances are top-notch as well , making it all the more regretful to see the actual plot is so dull and déjà-vu . Browsing through the IMDb , I just found out lead actress Eun-Ju Lee committed suicide at the tender age of 25 . That's a damn shame , because her devoted performance is definitely one of the highlights of " Unborn but Unforgotten " .
405152	2020269	47966	5.0	She'll Slither Her Way To Your Heart ?	What's the first behavior rule when you're visiting a faraway continent ? particularly Asia , Africa or South America ? that culturally speaking differs a lot from your own ? Duh , don't interfere with local religious movements and / or voodoo cults , because they WILL come after you and they WILL find you , even when you consider yourself to be safe back home again . " Cult of the Cobra " is a charming and fairly entertaining 50's occult thriller , but it's certainly nothing special or unique . In fact , the plot is quite derivative of the Jacques Tourneur / Val Lewton classic " Cat People " ( undeniably one of the greatest horror milestones ever made ) , since both stories revolve gorgeous women living with the ability ? or is it curse ? ? to transform into a deadly animal . Six American members of the same Air Force unit spend a few touristy days in an Asian country ( my best guess would be either India or Malaysia ) and bluntly pay a snake charmer big money to secretly attend a gathering of the infamous Lamian cult , of which the members supposedly change themselves in snakes and back . Naturally they get caught , when the dumbest boy of them all takes a photograph , and only narrowly escape . Unaware they've been placed under a curse , the six friends start being killed off one by one when back in the United State . Moreover , the mysterious accidents began simultaneously with Tom acquaintance with an introvert exotic beauty living across the hall . " Cult of the Cobra " benefits the most from Faith Domergue's performance as the oddly seductive Lisa ( she's a lot better here than she was in " This Island Earth " or " It Came from beneath the Sea " ) and a couple of imaginative camera gimmicks , like for example snake POV shots and nice use of shadow effects . Unfortunately , there are also several overlong and tedious scenes and not a single one of the male protagonists deserves any of your sympathy . Especially Tom is a pretty loathsome guy , since his behavior is obtrusive and aggressive towards women and jealous towards his own friends .
404953	2020269	74575	5.0	God is a Spaghetti-Cowboy !	The indescribably poor DVD-quality almost ruined the entire movie for me . " God's Gun " is part of a Three-Pack DVD of Lee Van Cleef spaghetti western films , the other two being " Kid Vengeance " and " Death Rides a Horse " . The box looks nice and it's a great initiative to release more of Van Cleef's work on DVD , but the picture and sound quality are terribly , terribly poor ! The colors are faded and most of the time you can't even make out the eyes or the expressions on the characters ' faces . It's far worse than a VHS which stood on the bottom shelf of a videostore for the past 20 years , so watch out in case you consider purchasing this puppy on DVD . The film itself is fine , and I don't really understand all the harsh and negative comments by the other reviewers . The plot isn't exactly original and the film clearly lacks the touch of a professional genre director like Leone or Corbucci , but as long as you're simply expecting to see macho cowboys wiping each other out with pistols and shotguns , you can't possibly be disappointed . Any western that combines the talents and charisma of Lee Van Cleef and Jack Palance is worth tracking down if you ask me , and even more so if it also contains guest appearances by Richard Boone and Sybil Danning . Van Cleef plays the priest of a peaceful little town that suddenly gets invaded by a sadistic gang of criminals led by Jack Palance . The priest is killed when he tries to uphold justice in the little town , but his youthful acolyte escapes and seeks the help of twin-brother Lewis who lives in Mexico . Together they return to avenge Father John's dead and clear the town of crime once and for all . The script of " God's Gun " is very clichéd and contains too many stupid improbabilities . For example , Johnny finds Lewis in less than two days even though he only knew he lived " somewhere in Mexico " and ? moreover ? he can't even ask for directions because he's struck mute . For some reason , there are also two totally redundant and overlong flashback sequences that don't add anything to the story . Naturally , the cast of characters are dreadful stereotypes , including the drunkard Sheriff and the gorgeous , voluptuous wenches in the local saloon . The music and many of the inventive camera angles are directly stolen from " The Good , The Bad and The Ugly " . Oh well , at least the gunfights are violent & nasty , and Jack Palance is the ultimately cool baddie .
405185	2020269	94627	5.0	Hack ' em up GOOD !	Routine and by-the-numbers 80's slasher , but nonetheless a very entertaining one albeit a bit slow in places . " Edge of the Axe " is remotely gorier and creepier than most of the contemporary slasher efforts , because the killer wears an uncanny plaster mask and uses ( like the title makes pretty clear ) a sharp ' n shiny axe to turn his victims into ? and I quote one of the cop characters here ? hamburger meat ! The killer targets yummy women living in two remote neighbor towns named Patterson and Paddock . The exaggeratedly imbecilic police officers try to pretend that even the most obvious murder cases are ordinary accidents , or in the best case , unfortunate suicide . The plot doesn't provide too many clues for the audiences to join guessing who the killer is , but don't bother anyway , as there are a couple of delightfully absurd and unpredictable twists near the end of the film . Downright AWESOME end shot , by the way . The direction in " Edge of the Axe " is much better and more stylish than in most 80's slasher , but I didn't except anything else , since José Ramón Larraz isn't just some randomly assigned director , but the creator of a couple of underrated and marvelous 70's gems , like " Vampyres " , " The Blood Virgin " and " The House that Vanished " . Mostly thanks to his skills and experience , " Edge of the Axe " is occasionally atmospheric and even suspenseful in places . The special effects are adequate and the imagery ( like chopped off heads floating in the water and decomposed corpses falling from attics ) is suitably nasty , making this an above average and recommendable effort . Larraz was also responsible for another obscure slasher puppy with an appealing title , namely " Rest in Pieces " . Based on this movie , I think I should start looking for the other one , too .
405285	2020269	94620	5.0	a bucket of gore , anyone ? ? ?	I found this film , hidden deep in my closet of horror . Without having any clue what so ever I began watching it . After the first 10 minutes , the face of 4 people were already ripped off . I'm always up for a bit of gore so I left it on . Afterwards , when I looked it up here , It seemed to be a part of the Zombi-series , brought to us originally by Lucio Fulci . . . makes sense . So , it's also known as : Zombi 4 or " Oltre la morte " . . . and about a million other aka's . Italian zombie films are always fun . Even though they all start to look alike , you just keep on watching them . I don't know why that is actually . It's just a common thing . The make up is gore enough but the music is disturbing ( especially the rock ballads ) . The story ? OK , a group of soldiers ( sort of ) are caught on an island . On this same island , a curse has been spoken by a witchdoctor upon a group of scientists 20 years ago . One little girl escaped and now she's back on the island ( what are the odds on that , huh ) The zombies are still dwelling around and hunt down the now grown up girl and her friends . That's it . . . don't tell me you expected more . One more thing . The leading actors name is Jeff Stryker ( he also has several aka's ) Does that name means anything to you ? If not , you're a good boy / girl because Mr . Stryker is an adult actor . According to his biography , this is the only non-adult film that he ever made . . . Zombies and porn , that's a hell of a resumé if you ask me .
404969	2020269	814022	5.0	Shockingly mundane & ordinary ?	" Bangkok Dangerous " isn't a bad film ? or at least not as bad as most of the reviews around here claim ? but it is an astonishingly ordinary film that features literally every cliché of " hired assassin " concept you can possibly think of . There's the lonely and super-skilled hit man who intents to pull of one last job before quitting the business for good , he teaches his errand boy to become his successor , finds love and happiness with a girl for the first time and ? last but not least ? refuses to make the final hit because his target is a noble individual . We know this is the prototypic pitch of every thriller in its type , yet we still pay the full price of a cinema ticket because the film stars Nicolas Cage and we'll probably see a lot of spectacular action and virulent gunfire . " Bangkok Dangerous " is a big-budgeted remake of a Thai thriller released in 1999 , which was also directed by the Pang brothers . In the original , the hit man was a deaf-mute but since Nicolas Cage is far too expensive to have him shut up the whole time , they made his love interest a deaf-mute instead . Unfortunately , this takes away the one truly ingenious aspect about the original . What remains is a painfully predictable and bland thriller that can't even be saved by the handful of impressively staged action sequences . Still I wouldn't call " Bangkok Dangerous " a complete waste of time , though , as there are a couple of stylish and worthwhile ? albeit less obvious ? elements working in its favor . Nic Cage gives a good performance as the unworldly killer and particularly the Pang Bros ' depiction of the city of Bangkok is deeply enchanting . Especially at night it looks like a melancholic and depressing place infested with prostitution , petty crimes and perverted tourists . The moody soundtrack emphasizes the atmosphere of melancholy even more . This is definitely not a film that'll increase the tourist business there . Otherwise there's very little to say about " Bangkok Dangerous " . If you're a fan of Nicolas Cage and rough action , you won't regret giving this one a look . Just realize you'll have completely forgotten about it the next day .
406698	2020269	269347	5.0	A violent game of hide and seek	Everybody faces stress at work these days . Even highly trained military men snap from time to time . What do they do then ? They go out and use the skills they learned for killing people randomly . That's the plot of this , rather violent , film by William Friedkin . OK , the story is pretty déjà-vu . The best pupil of a special trained force goes nuts and can only be stopped by the man who learn him everything he knows . All the ingredients are present : The escape during the transportation , the visit to the woman and child he loves , the car chases , the jumping of a bridge . . . But we don't mind watching the clichés in this kind of films . We just sit back and enjoy the action and the acting performances . In this case : Benicio Del Toro and Tommy Lee Jones ( He looks good with a beard , by the way ) I think we've got to accept the fact that William Friedkin will never make classics like ' the French Connection ' or ' The Exorcist ' anymore . His films are average now filled with adrenaline and good acting . Rules of Engagement was like that and now the Hunted is too . My humble opinion :
404253	2020269	478265	5.0	The Return of " Rednecksploitation " ? Not quite . . .	I'm a big fan of the so-called horror / cult sub genre of " Rednecksploitation " . This was another typically 70's cinema phenomenon , primarily popularized by the huge success of " Deliverance " and including some glorious titles like " Poor Pretty Eddie " , " The Texas Chain Saw Massacre " , " Two Thousand Maniacs ! " and " Just Before Dawn " . These disturbingly demented movies are by definition set in small Southern American communities where the local ( and usually inbred ) population doesn't care too much about dental hygiene , copulate with barn animals , dance to hideous banjo music and ? naturally ? rape & kill all the civilized persons passing through their territory . Genuine " Rednecksploitation " movies like that simply cannot be made nowadays anymore , because they're filthy , discriminating , rough and extremely women-unfriendly . When coincidentally stumbling upon " Small Town Folk " , I secretly hoped this would be the long-awaited return of hillbilly-horror , or at least a competent enough homage to the good old days . And this miniature British production surely had a lot of things going for it . The British as well have their very own cinematic Rednecksploitation classic ( " Straw Dogs " ) , the film was entirely put together by a group of friends ( which usually means fewer restrictions ) and the cover promisingly depicts black-teethed & crazy-eyed posing with scythes and axes ! Unfortunately the film isn't nearly as good as it looks , but still I can't bring myself at writing overly negative stuff . After all , there's a lot of obvious goodwill and ambition present in this , just the execution and eventual outcome is somewhat unsatisfying . For some reason , maybe to make the film more accessible for wider audiences , the digital filming style and narrative structure makes " Small Town Folk " look like a fantasy-tale as much as like a horror film . The fantasy and comedy aspects inevitably undercut the horror ideas and eventually the film becomes too silly to pass for a full-blooded horror film and yet too grim & bloody to pass for a fantasy flick to watch with the whole family . The story is standard , with a young couple driving their Jeep through isolated British landscapes and hopelessly getting lost . Two Knackermen ? whatever the hell that may be ? advise the couple to stay far away from a little place called Grockleton , but naturally that's exactly where they stop to spend the night . The hideous locals are very interested in Susan , since there's a severe shortage of women in Grockleton , but her hubby Rick fights back and he gets some welcome support from a teenage biker armed with a Polaroid camera and a helmet . The Grockleton hicks outwardly live up to the all known stereotypes , but unfortunately none of them gives a convincing performance . The main redneck characters ( Landlord , Dobbin ? ) all severely overact and lack something essentially petrifying . Actually , the only truly menacing-looking ones were those whose faces were covered and didn't talk much , like the scarecrow-brothers and the horseshoe-archer . There are some nice bits and pieces of gore , including a couple of sickle-killings , but " Small Town Folk " never fully feels like the brutal backwoods horror film it ought to have been . Warwick Davis of " Willard " - fame and numerous " Leprechaun " movies makes a small appearance , but few of the stuff he says makes any sense and I seriously have no idea what a Knackerman does for a living . It's not a great film , but if Peter Stanley-Ward and his circle of pals decide to make more films , I won't hesitate to check them out .
405164	2020269	94997	5.0	Nuns , but no Nuns	" Demonia " is one of the master horror director Lucio Fulci's final achievements and , though not exactly one of his finest ones , it remains a truly interesting film for his many avid fans to track down and enjoy . The first half hour is tame and slow and , generally speaking , the entire film isn't nearly as gory as Fulci's previous highlights ( though there's one jaw-dropping scene that compensates for nearly everything ) , but the script is ambitiously compelling and the atmospheric Sicilian settings are quite wonderful . Fulci even managed to create suspense at some points here and successfully sustains an adequately mysterious ambiance . The depiction of the eerie nun's face on the cover looks appealing , but " Demonia " has really nothing in common with the so-called " Nunsploitation " movies that also primarily came out of Italy . The nuns in this film were barbarically crucified by angry villagers in the catacombs of their Sicilian monastery in the late 15th Century . More than 500 years later , an archaeological expedition intends to investigate the ruins , only the local population brutally objects and act as if they're all commonly sharing a morbid secret . Particularly the young archeology student Liza Harris becomes increasingly obsessed with the mysterious convent's past , as visions and nightmares lure her straight to the exact place where the nuns were executed . The cloister's background is sinister , to say the least , and especially the flashback sequence is unsettling . Death occurs in the film frequently and with pleasingly nasty effects , including implements , beheading and spontaneously attacking meat hooks . And , of course , since it's undeniably Lucio's pet peeve , you may also anticipate the repulsive removal of someone's eyeball . But the very best piece of gore , accomplished with stunningly realistic effects , shows a guy getting split in half ? human wishbone style ? clean down the middle . This scene alone is worthy of a top-recommendation ! Unfortunately several sequences are extremely overlong and tedious , as if our good friend the directors thought it was necessary to endlessly stretch the plot to reach the running time of the film . Shame actually , because in case of a little less padding and pointlessness , " Demonia " could have been a modest classic listed directly underneath his best works " The Beyond " , " City of the Living Dead " , " House by the Cemetery " , " Cat in the Brain " and " Zombi 2 " . Fulci granted himself a modest but entertaining role as the police inspector investing the series of grisly murders . To those who don't know him , he's the elderly man with enormous glasses big enough to cover half of his face .
405972	2020269	191397	6.0	The ideal " sit back and relax " - comedy	I think it's pretty obvious you don't have to choose The Replacements if you're interested in seeing a unique and / or innovating cinema experience . The Replacements perfectly delivers what you expect . . . A good hour and a half of pure fun and laughs . It's a delightful little comedy with decent acting performances , hilarious situations and terrific quote material . The film uses all the typical clichés and about every character is stereotypical , but maybe that's the charm of it all . We get to see a textbook Sumo-wrestler , a blond cheerleader who can't even spell right and even the vulgar Welsh guy who smokes and curses on the field . The script is so utterly predictable and the feel-good message is shoved down your throat shamelessly , but still you can't resist to keep watching . There's a terrific light-hearted atmosphere hanging around the entire movie and sometimes , that's just all it takes to be satisfied with a movie . Keanu Reeves is a heck of lot more watchable in these type of comedies than he is as an action hero and Gene Hackman is great as usual . Even though he's clearly directing on automatic pilot , he never fails to impress . There are also good side roles by Jon Favreau , Orlando Jones , Rhys Ifans and even Art LaFleur ( it's been a while since I last saw him ) . Naturally , the good guys win from the arrogant bullies , the development of the love-story was unavoidable as well and the use of typical Football-songs - like Rock ' N Roll part 2 - bring a smile to your face . The Replacements is the kind of movie that requires a few beers and popcorn . . . than you've got yourself a good old-fashioned brainless viewing .
405003	2020269	91560	6.0	The Night Evelyn Filled Some Graves .	Why this little movie receives such a low rating and such harshly negative reviews is a bit beyond me . Well , actually no , it's not . . . " Mountaintop Motel Massacre " IS a pretty bad and poorly made textbook 80's slasher , but that doesn't mean it can't be fun for hardcore fans ! Apart from the fantastic DVD-cover and tagline , M . M . M . sustains an overall creepy atmosphere ( especially the music is scary ) and the sets & scenery are often very effective ( dolls ! ! Dolls are eerie ! ) . However , the pacing is admittedly rather slow , the cinematography is way too dark and the murder sequences are tame and non-gory , which makes it all impossible to count it among the better efforts in a decade overcrowded by similar films . What the story mainly lacks is background info . The basic idea of a crazy old lady butchering the guests at her motel is interesting enough , but a bit more feedback about her condition would have been welcome . Early in the film , we find out that motel proprietress Evelyn spent a few years in a mental institution . It never becomes quite clear why she was admitted ( her husband's passing , maybe ? ) , but her teenage daughter Lori obviously fears she's not cured yet . Afer killing Lori , the voices inside Evelyn's head tell her that she'll end up in the madhouse again if she doesn't kill everyone else as well . The unfortunate victims are a couple of newlywed rednecks , two elderly men and a phony record producer hoping to score two chicks at once . Evelyn's murder methods are a bit awkward , as she initially unleashes all types of vermin on her guests before attacking them personally with a sickle . M . M . M features too many tedious moments in which absolutely nothing happens and the grand finale is sadly lethargic . I heard some bad things about the acting performances , but I actually thought they were adequate . The only truly embarrassing actors are the paramedics trying to revive Evelyn's daughter at the beginning of the film . And maybe the guy who gets bitten by a snake . Not a very good film , but it surely has some memorable and praiseworthy elements that shouldn't be overlooked . If you really think this is a hopelessly awful 80's slasher , then stay the hell away from titles like " Appointment with Fear " or " Hide and Go Shriek " .
406263	2020269	964539	6.0	Cadavers aplenty in the Body Shop !	I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised and got hooked on " Pathology " right from the very first minute , even though it was for a very stupid and even completely wrong reason . The opening sequence , still before the credits appear on screen , depicts a handful of medical students disrespectfully toying around with their research cadavers . They poke their already rotting flesh and use them as puppets for their obscene and perverted role plays . It's sick ! It's twisted ! It's morally incorrect ! I LOVED that ! Especially since most horror movies nowadays lack this sort of offensive tastelessness and moral incorrectness . Surely this bizarre intro will already temper the enthusiasm of most viewers , but for other sick puppies like myself it might be the beginning of a very promising new horror sleeper hit . And generally speaking " Pathology " is a satisfying horror film . The concept is intriguing , the movie is well-directed and fast-paced , there are several unexpected plot twists and there's an admirably large amount of engrossing make-up effects and nauseating imagery . The wholesome is eventually brought down by implausibility and sheer illogicalness , but let's come back to that later . The story introduces the brilliant pathology student Ted Grey , who joins the class of the eminent Dr . Quentin Morris and comes into contact with a bunch of equally gifted but totally obnoxious and wayward fellow students . The group , led by the charismatic Jake Gello , drags Ted along into their wild nights of drugs , alcohol and partying . They invent a sinister game where each one commits a random and so-called perfect murder in turn , only for the other members to try and discover the victim's cause of death . When Ted's beloved fiancée moves into town he wants to quit the game , but obviously Jake Gello won't let him . " Pathology " is a wild , eventful , exciting and really brutal . Director Mark Schoelermann literally attacks us with compelling autopsy speeches and non-stop gruesome images and for a long while this combination works so effectively you don't even bother about all the questions the plot raises . Then suddenly you make a realization . Why do the pathology students commit these grueling murders again ? For kicks ? Because they can get away with it ? I'm sorry but that's nearly not enough reason to explain their actions . To commit the murders they commit , you'd have to be a natural born monster and natural born monsters don't waste seven years in med school first . And now that we're on the subject , I have a couple of friends who're studying to become a doctor and it's a mentally as well as physically exhausting duty , with a lot of on-the-job training and nightly research work . Supposing pathology studies are at least something similar , I don't think these people have time for extra-curricular activities like drinking and adultery , let alone the carefully planning , executing and solving of perfect murders . Oh well , a certain absence of logic and reason is forgivable in a horror movie , I guess , especially when most of the other crucial aspects are above the average quality level . If you like bloody images that are intended for strong stomachs , a fair portion of sleaze and hardcore shock endings , I would definitely recommend " Pathology " .
404463	2020269	95454	6.0	When auntie F . comes to town , there will surely be blood !	" The Kiss " is actually just a rudimentary & simplistic witchcraft story about supernatural powers getting passed through the female members of the same bloodline , but director Densham neatly polishes up the concept with impressively explicit make-up effects ( courtesy of Chris Walas ' company ) , adequate supportive character drawings and atmospheric building up towards the death scenes . The story opens in the early 60's in the Belgian Congo , where two sisters become separated at the train station . The youngest one , Felice , is seriously ill but her aunt miraculously cures her by passing an alien-like creature into her body through a kiss . 25 years later the other sister tragically dies in a car accident , leaving behind a husband and a stunningly beautiful adolescent daughter named Amy . Aunt Felice shows up again ( in the ravishingly matured version of Joanna Pacula ) and quickly works her way into the family by seducing her widowed brother-in-law . Auntie Felice is clearly just interested in Amy's body as the host for the inheritable creature , and she won't hesitate to use violent voodoo tricks against anyone that stands between her and the young girl . " The Kiss " is one modest class above the majority of 80's witchcraft-movies , because it features a little more directorial flair and style . There's a continuously pleasing level of suspense and film is suitably gruesome , including images of people burning alive , losing body parts underneath trucks and getting strangled on escalators . Felice has an OTT grotesque wild cat assisting her to kill people and there's a bizarre ( but macabre ) montage showing Amy menstruating in class whilst her father makes love to the sinister aunt . That was quite an awkward moment , and I'm not entirely sure about the symbolic significance / importance of that sequence . In fact , there's quite a lot of sexual innuendo that appears to be a bit lost in the wholesome of the story . Anyway , the story grows increasingly sillier near the end , resulting in a highly implausible and chuckles-inducing finale . Meredith Salenger was truly adorable girl in the late 80's ( and still a gorgeous woman today ) and I severely regret the fact her career didn't skyrocketed after this film . Recommended to watch at least once , particularly if you appreciate feminine beauty and graphic gore .
404711	2020269	95319	6.0	Delightful Dutch junk	Honneponnetje is a completely meaningless , but very entertaining 80's comedy from the Netherlands . It's a light-hearted waste of time , made with a lot of enthusiasm and goodwill from both cast and crew . The unusual title refers to the star girl's name in the film . She's a sixteen-year-old cutie , stuck behind the walls of a very strict and prudish Catholic boarding school . She manages to get her hands on some erotic literature and she quickly becomes curious and intrigued by the act of lovemaking . So , our little sweetheart independently decides to escape the boarding school and hikes to a nearby city to find out the meaning of ' love ' . The entire comical premise of the film handles about the girl's innocence and naïveté . She doesn't understand the sexist and anti-feminist remarks men make about her looks and she willingly follows anyone who tries to abuse her youthful beauty . She even ends up on the set of a pornographic movie without knowing what's going on ! Meanwhile , mother Superior worries about her institute's good reputation and spreads the word that Honneponnetje has been kidnapped . Like usual in this type of films , there's a forced happy ending and a happy happy joy joy moral attached to it . But , dropping all skepticism , Honneponnetje is good fun and sexy entertainment . Nada Van Nie , whose tender appearance really helps this film's credibility , plays the girl . Other than this film , she only starred ( by my knowledge ) in ' Intensive Care ' . A film that might as well can be referred to as the worst Dutch film ever . The Belgian class actor Herbert Flack has a delightful role as the adult film producer called ' Apollo ' . Funniest scene : The young beauty sees her own breasts for the first time and looks amazed . In the boarding school , she was only allowed to wash herself while wearing a long , white virgin robe .
406386	2020269	69956	6.0	Dances With Wolves . . . with a cannibal-twist !	Deep River Savages represents Umberto Lenzi's first steps in the notorious field of cannibalism and jungle adventure movies . This infamous director will gross out entire audiences during the early 80's , with vicious cult flicks like ' Cannibal Ferox ' ; ' Eaten Alive by the Cannibals ' and ' Nightmare City ' . This film is more like a pioneer and Lenzi carefully explores the primitive jungle communities and their traditional rites . Deep River Savages isn't half as gross as the title and DVD-cover leads you to believe and it basically is a social portrait mixed with an authentic love-story ! ? Believe it or not ! Actually ? the best way to describe this film is : Dances with Wolves ? with cannibals ! The plots of both movies are pretty much alike , the only differences are the setting and the fact Kevin Costner's film is praised all over the world while nobody has ever heard of Deep River Savages . John ? an Englishman ? is traveling across Eastern Asia when he gets mixed up in a bar-fight . He accidentally kills a man and flees on one of the many unknown rivers . He ends up as a prisoner in primitive tribe , somewhere deep in the jungle . The aboriginals actually form a rather joyful community ! They spend their days watching animal-fights ( roosters and snakes versus martens ) and swimming naked . Our ? civilized ' friend is tortured at first and he attempts to escape . But , pretty soon he falls in love with the local beauty ( Me Me Lai ? who looks even better here than she did in Deodato's Jungle Holocaust ) and marries her . John feels at home there now and he even helps the tribe in fighting the sadistic enemy-tribe from the across the river . The film contains very few action sequences and is overall pretty boring . I don't blame Lenzi for this , though . Even though I prefer his later splatter films , you have to keep in mind this movie was made in 1972 ! Deep River Savages also looks very cheap , amateurish and the cinematography isn't anywhere near as stunning as in other cannibal films . The whole movie depends on Me Me Lai's beautiful naked body and the short ( but action-packed ) climax . Nonetheless , it stays recommended to Italian horror-admirers who're interested in the roots of ' Savage Cinema ' .
404374	2020269	276935	6.0	Dragon Ball Ishii !	With " Electric Dragon 80 . 000V " , director Sogo Ishii brings homage to . . . himself , really ! Who else could he pay tribute to , because HE is the one man who single-handedly started the wild and anarchist Japanese punk-cinema and , even though other directors may have had a lot more success with it ( for example Shinya Tsukamoto with " Tetsuo " ) , Ishii is and will always remain the pioneer of punk . That being said , " ED8kV " is an extremely weird accomplishment and it's probably the type of movie that spontaneously causes people to suffer from epilepsy & twitching . It feels like a 55 minutes long industrial videoclip , with chaotic camera movements , extremely loud noises and the most unique use of black and white photography you'll ever see . Ishii also put quite a bit of wicked imagination into the script , as he revolves his film on an unorthodox type of super-hero named Dragon Eye Morrison . The young punker-protagonist survived a massive electro-shock as a kid , but the accident somehow sparked severe aggression and powers . He sleeps with chains around his wrists and boisterously plays on his electric guitar to control the anger . Eventually , he's allowed to let out all his furious anger in a battle against his oddly masked nemesis Thunderbolt Buddha . Crazy film , a lot less nightmarish than the aforementioned " Tetsuo " , but definitely an unforgettable visual attack on pretty much all your senses . Ishii's direction feels genuinely hostile and aggressive , as if he wanted to take revenge on big studios and meddlesome producers who always interfered with his personal visions and ideas , resulting in final cuts the director didn't even like . " Burst City " is the ideal example of that . As said , the film is only 55 minutes long , but personally I thought it was more than long enough ! A couple of minutes extra and I probably would have started hallucinating about talking lizards and malicious Buddha's myself . And my tympanum membranes probably wouldn't have survived a longer version , neither .
404581	2020269	144814	6.0	Carrie's baby-sister is just as fiery as she was !	It's usually not a very good idea to make a belated sequel to a horror film , especially not when the original is generally considered a genre masterpiece and from the hands of writer Stephen King and director Brian DePalma . Yet , the makers of " Carrie 2 : The Rage " didn't make complete fools out of themselves , as it is a very entertaining and well-scripted story that appeals to both the fans of the classy original and younger horror lovers . Well , the term " horror " doesn't totally fit this film , because it's only the climax ( last 15 minutes or so ) which is bloody . The best way to describe " The Rage " pretty much is " American Pie " meets " She's All That " with a gory finale . The story is set in a typically American high school where the students only have sex , football and cheer-leading on their minds . The only difference is that this is the same high school were Carrie White raised a little hell 23 years earlier and now there's a new girl with telekinetic powers arriving . . . The unpopular Rachel Lang receives a lot of attention from the top-quarterback Jesse Ryan , and thus the rest of the sport and cheerleader team plot to humiliate her in public . They obviously didn't learn much from their school's infamous history . After a quite atmospheric intro and a suicide-sequence which pretty much is the coolest I've ever seen , " The Rage " becomes a little slow and it starts suffering from too many clichés . Still , during these rather dull moments there's the good acting of Emily Bergyl and Jason London to enjoy , as well as some remotely funny teenager sex-jokes . The climax is very much worth anticipating and contains some really graphic killings . The make-up effects are terrifically gruesome and some of the macabre deaths are very ingenious . This sure is a predictable and redundant film , but that doesn't mean it can't be fun .
406080	2020269	60865	6.0	Flawed but interesting horror / detective thriller .	" Circus of Fear " is a a rare and hard to come across 60's shocker , directed by the same man who made the terrific goth-horror classic " The City of the Dead " . This latter happens to be one of my all time favorite suspense films and even though " Circus of Horror " isn't as unsettling or astonishing , it still definitely is a very good movie with an interesting plot and an original setting . To my regret , however , I also must admit that it's a severely flawed movie , and that's largely because the makers didn't seem to know for sure whether they were shooting a detective-thriller . . . or a horror film . The opening sequences show a group of men robbing a truck transporting bank money and the loot then mysteriously disappears within the scenery of a traveling circus . Scotland Yard inspector Elliot investigates the case and encounters many potential culprits , such as a masked lion tamer ( horror veteran Christopher Lee ) , a blackmailing dwarf and an emotionally frustrated knife-thrower ( quite a danger in his profession ) . Many older Brit-thrillers had extended , well-mounted heist sequences , so the one featuring here isn't very spectacular . The sequences inside the circus are very atmospheric , though , and nearly every character looks threatening and as if they're hiding something . The plot takes quite a few twists near the end and the outcome eventually is unsatisfying . . . or at least it was to me . The cast is excellent with yet another strong performance of Christopher Lee and a curious role for Klaus Kinski as Manfred . If you're familiar with classic horror , you'll recognize the dwarf from other genuine gems like " Vampire Circus " ( Hammer ) , " The Masque of the Red Death " ( Roger Corman ) and " Horror Hospital " . This could have been a much better movie but ? hey - who's complaining ? Definitely worth a watch if you can find it .
405181	2020269	96118	6.0	Happy Slashing !	100 % female and waving around the certificate of goody-goody Girl Scout , Angela signs in as a counselor at Rolling Hills summer camp . She's determined to make it a fun summer for everyone , singing Kumbaya-songs around the fire and all , but she keeps on having conflicts with rebellious and sex-hungry teenagers . In order to uphold the camp's happy spirit , Angela has no other option but to send the rotten apples home . Of course " sending people home " in Angela's book means slaughtering them brutally ? Talking in terms of 80's slashers , the original " Sleepaway Camp " ( released in 1983 ) is a classic . Along with a selected group of other titles ( like " Prom Night " , " Friday the 13th " and " The Prowler " ) , the original is a film that every self-respecting horror fan simply has to see . This first sequel isn't nearly as ' essential ' , but it still stands as a highly enjoyable and relaxing film . The script contains absolutely no tension or plot-twists , since you already know the culprit's identity from the beginning , so all the excitement depends on the various methods by which the teenager are killed off . Angela uses drills , strings of a guitar , car battery-acid , campfires and there even is an entire act in which campers battle dressed up like horror icons Jason Vorhees , Freddy Krueger and Leatherface ! The biggest trump of " Sleepaway Camp " is that it never takes itself too seriously and it has absolutely no ambition to be a compelling film . All in one , a light-hearted movie with gore , nudity and an attractive cast . You simply can't expect more from a movie like this .
406724	2020269	785280	6.0	A Very Neat Monster	The first episode of Showtime's " Dexter " surely displays great potential , ingenuity and the involvement of many talented persons both in front and behind the camera , but it's arguably also a bit flawed and slightly too implausible for its own good . The main concept of the show of course raises an ancient and all-too-familiar debate , as topics like retribution and taking the law into your own hands are somewhat glorified here . During one ( of many ) flashbacks , his father encourages the adolescent Dexter to use his incontrollable urge to kill for a good cause , namely to extinguish criminals that escaped blood justice through the unstable Miami legal system . If you have to kill then at least make sure you kill bad people ? Hmm , is that morally acceptable , let alone something to proclaim on prime-time TV ? So , as you can tell , Dexter Morgan is a relentless killer but not a bad person . He works at the forensics team of the Miami police , upholds a healthy relationship with his cop sister as well as many other friends in the department and has a love affair with a former rape victim . Dexter appears to be an average guy , he just controls his murderous hunger through going after sick criminals in his spare time , like a pedophile and an internet snuff-movie maker . Meanwhile , there's a new and devoted serial killer in town who professionally cuts up prostitutes without spilling a drop of blood . Dexter is intrigued with this modus operandi , and the culprit has noticed him too . " Dexter " looks as if it's going to become a good show , with many interesting characters and set pieces that are uncanny enough to fascinate even the most experienced fans horror and thrillers . The narrative is often a bit redundant and whiny , as Dexter insists on informing us that he's emotionally numb and introvert . This show isn't exactly what I expected , as I was preparing for something really dark , scary & cynical , but it definitely isn't bad . Michael C . Hall ( " Six Feet Under " ) is pretty great already and I'm sure he'll grow into the role even more .
405022	2020269	67487	6.0	Beware of greedy , imaginary unfaithful , worm-congested red-haired corpse brides . . .	Completely UNlike expected , I didn't like this creatively titled movie as much as I thought I would . " The Night Evelyn Came out of the Gave " features all the basic ingredients that make Italian horror fanatics ' mouths water , and it is in fact pretty good , yet it doesn't leave you with that fantastic feeling of total amazement like so many other gialli / Gothic films do . What went wrong mainly ? Well , one too many tedious sequences , for starters , but primarily it's the fact that justice apparently must NOT be done ! There's more than one murderer in this story and they honestly don't all get the punishment they deserve . The rest of the film is varying from good to great ! Director Emilio Miraglia offers a largely compelling giallo-plot , but with the atmosphere & set pieces of a typical Gothic horror production ! This means we're following a convoluted and demented crime conspiracy but set in an ancient ominous castle and featuring eerie family vaults , whips and gigantic cobwebs . Two years later , in 1973 , the great Antonio Margheriti also proved with " Seven Deaths in a Cat's Eye " that these two fabulous horror sub genre's can be blend perfectly . And he did it even slightly better , as that particular film didn't suffer from so many holes in the plot . The wealthy Lord Cunningham has the strange habit of luring red-headed beauties to his castle , suffering from a vision of another redhead running naked through a meadow , and subsequently killing the gals barbarically with a whip . This ritual describes his therapy for getting over his wife's death , since she passed away shortly after him ( falsy ? ) accusing her of adultery . When the Lord finally takes everyone's advise and re-marries with a stunning beauty , all kinds of mysterious events occur , indicating that the first wife returned from the dead with a vengeance . Hence the not-so-subtle title ! The story is always interesting but the pacing is a little slow and not one character is likable . However , that makes the murders all the more enjoyable ! They're not particularly gory , but certainly ingenious ! The killing of the wheel-chaired lady is notably brutal ! The music and quantity of nudity & euro-sleaze are also tip top , so there are more than enough elements left to reward this film with a positive rating .
404267	2020269	82118	6.0	Severe butchering !	This is not even a rip-off from " Friday the 13th " ; it's almost an exact clone ! Most 80's slashers at least try to bring some change in setting , the killer's background or continuity , but Maylem's film doesn't . Period ! The plot features the exact same group of teenagers during summer camp . Just as it was the case in " Friday the 13th " , the teens play stupid pranks , take canoe-trips ( guided by banjo-music stolen from " Deliverance " ) and tell spooky campfire stories . The killer , Cropsy ? what's in a name ? shows strange resemblance to Jason Vorhees as he also is the dude everyone always picked on . So , this movie shamelessly steals all the elements that made F13 so popular . So what ? If you manage to find a fully uncut version , you'll be exposed to some of the most repulsive and nauseating slaughtering ever shot ! The Burning is gore to the max and that's exactly what makes it exceptional in its field . They really don't make ' em as bloody as this anymore . The nowadays horror directors should take a good look at movies like " The Burning " in order to find out how to really disgust and shock the viewers . The infamous raft sequence explicitly shows the massacre of five young teens , not leaving much to the imagination . Maestro Tom Savini's make-up effects provided this movie with a well-deserved spot in the notorious video-nasties list ! As far as redundant teen-slashers go , this is a must see !
406183	2020269	294594	7.0	Voyeurism through the ages . . .	The story-idea of " The Gathering " is one of the most original and unsettling horror premises in a very long time . This is a religious and supernatural thriller that focuses on mystery and ominous atmosphere , instead of grossing you out with nasty killings and / or horrible monsters . Although heavily flawed and quite illogical at times , " The Gathering " managed to surprise ( and even shock ) me with its intelligent screenplay about a small English town that stumbles upon an old and entirely buried ( ! ) church . Together with this discovery , The young Cassie ( Christina Ricci ) arrives in town , but a seemly fatal car-accident erases her memory . While her host Simon Kirkman is attempting to unravel the mystery of the buried church and its unidentified statues that witness Christ's crucification from the reverse side , Cassie starts to have visions about a soon-to-happen drama in the quiet little town . She also finds out that the stone-statues in the church look exactly like faces she keeps on seeing in her visions , although they appear to be simple bystanders . . . It's hard to summarize this movie without giving away the essence of the story , which is a terrific and stunning finding . It's a pretty damn shame that this movie never really received the attention it deserved , as the quality-level comes close to that of exaggeratedly praised titles such as " The Others " or " The Sixth Sense " . Christina Ricci is very convincing as the confused heroine . Beautiful Ricci is perfectly able to carry the entire film , although some of the supportive roles are also definitely worth mentioning , like Ioan Gruffudd ( much better here as in blockbuster garbage like " King Arthur " or " Fantastic Four " ) and Kerry Fox ( " Wisdom of Crocodiles " ) . " The Gathering " is a must see in case you're fed up with overly gore teen-slashers or uninspired remakes of horror classics . The leading lady is terrific , the filming locations are mesmerizing and the story is actually something new ! ! See it !
405148	2020269	70355	7.0	Slightly " Cleaner " Harry ?	" Dirty Harry " was a revolutionary early 70's action movie that instantly caught the attention of cinema-loving ( and hating ) audiences because of its no-nonsense attitude , excessive depiction of violence and thoroughly nihilistic atmosphere . " Magnum Force " , the first sequel in the fairly long-running series and released barely two years after the original , is still an excessively violent and nihilistic toned action movie , but unfortunately it hasn't got the same shocking and adrenalin-rushing impact as " Dirty Harry " . Partially this is normal , since the surprise element has vanished , but especially the subject matter here is far less disturbing ( also far more fictional ) and even the character of Harry Callahan seems to have softened a little already . " Magnum Force " still remains a pretty terrific and highly exciting cop thriller , of course . I never doubted that for a single moment , especially not since the screenplay was penned down by no less than John Millius ( " Big Wednesday " , " Conan the Barbarian " ) and Michael Cimino ( " The Deer Hunter " ) . The problem ? if you can even call it that ? here is that " Magnum Force " is only a prototypic action vehicle , whereas " Dirty Harry " also served as a contemporary 70's statement to assure the times were rough and flower-power influences were dead , buried and gone forever . Harry apparently picked up his badge again , after throwing it away at the end of the original , since he's still upsetting his superiors by enforcing the law with unorthodox methods . He's called back to the homicide department when the city of San Francisco seems " plagued " by a series of killings of prominent gangsters , like drug barons , mafia couriers , pimps and professional hit men . Shortly after they narrowly escaped justice and got acquitted , the criminals ' are found barbarically murdered ? Executed , even . Harry initially suspects one of his closest colleagues struggling with depression , but there are other possibilities as well , like a young and straight-shooting posse of traffic cops . " Magnum Force " is exciting , but not exactly suspenseful since director Ted Post never really intends to make the killer's identity a big mystery . The vigilante-massacres are extremely sadistic to behold and especially the irrelevant interludes ( Harry single-handedly preventing the hijacking of a plane , Harry brutally sorting out a supermarket heist ? ) are super amusing . Harry Callahan may not be as " dirty " as he was in the first film , but Clint Eastwood nevertheless still portrays him as the ultimately cool tough cop . Eastwood also receives support from Hal Holbrook as the grumpy superior and David Soul ? who'd later play Hutch in the legendary series " Starsky and Hutch " ? as the younger cop . The soundtrack is excellent and the photography and editing are far more sophisticated as in the first film . There's even a replacement , albeit less memorable , quote for " Do you feel lucky , punk ? " ; namely " A man's got to know his limitations " .
404979	2020269	175526	7.0	SEX is all that matters !	Maybe I should start by saying I'm not the biggest slasher fan around here . Sure I can appreciate the classics like Halloween and the original Friday the 13th but they were never top of my list . And the post-Scream era has blown it all . Since this movie , everybody thinks they can make a horror film . The only thing they need is a few good looking girls who can yell very loud and a stupid outfit to give to the killer . This is kinda also the big idea behind CHERRY FALLS but , compared to most others , there are several good aspects and twists in this one . The story for starters . . . The killer's targets are exclusively virgins . This of course give a lot of opportunities to insert all sorts of humor . ( shy girls , computer geeks who never get laid , slutty girls ) It's all pretty predictable but it works . For example , I laughed pretty loud when some character said about another : " She thinks Fellatio is a characters in a Shakespeare play " As most films in the genre , the film tries to be as violent as possible , I was one of the lucky ones who saw the uncut version . If you're planning to see it , try to get your hands on this version . The story develops pretty well . The killer's background gets revealed bit by bit and it's scary enough to keep you interested . A few good twists too , I may say . Cherry Falls stars a few very decent actors . Michael Biehn ( always one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood , IMO ) is very convincing as the sheriff who discovers the truth behind the gore murders . His teenage ( virgin , of course ) daughter is played by Brittany Murphy . She gained fame and fortune lately by starring in that stupid Eminem film and a few others . She wasn't that famous yet when she did Cherry Falls , so I could enjoy her part . Her boyfriend ( named Kenny ) looks a lot like a young James Spader . So if they wanna do a remake of Secretary withing 15 years , they know who to cast . . . I also recognized a dumb looking DJ Qualls ( Road Trip , The New Guy , The Core ) I think this guy is doomed to play the nerd for the rest of his life . Oh well . . . In general : Of the thousand stupid slashers who got released over the past 8 years , this certainly is one of the best . You'll forget about it pretty soon , but it'll sure give you 90 minutes of fun and violence .
406462	2020269	765487	7.0	NOT your usual type of uninspired remake !	What a totally crazy ( yet highly admirable ) ambition to remake a Herschell Gordon Lewis film and actually add story depth , detailed character drawings , mystery and an atmosphere of morbidity ! But it works . At least , ? partially it works . Horror fanatics familiar with Lewis ' oeuvre know that his films are entertaining and sensationally gross , but they always severely lacked in the plotting department . Of all Lewis ' splatter films , " The Wizard of Gore " , released in 1970 , was definitely the one with the greatest potential and it's actually most unfortunate that the basic concept ideas weren't properly elaborated . Director Jeremy Kasten and writer Zach Chassler obviously must have felt the same way , as their remake cuts down on the gore ( but luckily not to much ) and attempts to give meaning and background to the whole idea of a maniacal magician . " The Wizard of Gore " is actually quite a unique oddity in the area of horror cinema nowadays ! People always complain about the overload of needless remakes and modern directors ' lack of own creativity ( and they're right , too ) but here's finally one remake that doesn't aspire to just bluntly copy the original , but to complete and perhaps even " improve " it . The result may not be entirely successful , but it's definitely a courageous approach and an overall enjoyable and recommended experience . This new version largely maintains the same plot as Lewis ' original film . Montag the Magnificent is a thoroughly uncanny magician / illusionist who , along with his hermit assistant , tours around with a quite unique and nightmarish act . He butchers seemingly random girls from the audience live on stage , yet when the audience panics and tries to flee , the light go on and the victims are standing there back in one piece again . A young reporter quickly discovers that the girls turn up dead the next day after all and their corpses are damaged exactly like they appeared to be on stage . Severely against the will of his girlfriend , he becomes obsessed with Montag's show and becomes entangled into a web of surreal nightmares , primitive drugs , physical agony and mental deterioration . " The Wizard of Gore " is still a pretty incoherent mess in which a lot of twists make absolutely no sense and a lot of vital questions remain unanswered , but at least you get the impression that Kasten and Chassler put thought and effort into providing an explanation for the events , and that is already an accomplishment to itself . Especially given the entirely illogical mishmash of half-decent ideas Herschell Gordon Lewis left behind . Moreover , this 2007 version benefices from a supremely macabre atmosphere and all the decors and set pieces look very grim . The gore and splatter effects clearly can't hold a candle to those of the original ( at least , when it comes of outrageousness ) , but still there's some excellent carnage on display . Gore , nudity , atmosphere and immensely creepy carnival music ? These are all great elements that allow you to overlook the occasionally senseless subject matter . Another thing which makes " The Wizard of Gore " a must-see for horror fanatics is the presence of no less than three phenomenal genre veterans , namely Crispin Glover , Brad Dourif and Jeffrey Combs .
406200	2020269	454932	7.0	Lucky & Angela : a versatile dream-team !	" May " surely was one of the most impressive & remarkable debuts in the horror genre ever , the short but masterful Masters of Horror episode " Sick Girl " definitely proved that they weren't just a one-hit-wonder and now , with " Roman " , Angela Bettis and Lucky McKee make it clear that they're here to stay ! Even though not on par with the two aforementioned titles , " Roman " is one of the most enchanting and artistically creative stories of the last few years and it's guaranteed to have at least some kind of emotional impact on you . Even though the characters drawings and atmosphere building is somewhat similar to " May " , this is not a real horror film . " Roman " actually can't be categorized in just one genre , as McKee and Bettis professionally blend together sinister horror , pitch-black comedy , melodrama and psychological thriller aspects . It's a tragic & hugely ironic tale of love vs . loneliness and how they can both turn out disastrously . Lucky McKee ? pretty damn good in his first real lead performance ? is Roman , an unhealthy introvert metal worker with an extremely depressing life-style . He doesn't talk to any of his colleagues , always eats the same pork & beans dinner and drinks the same type of beer and dreadfully fears simple things like TV . The highlight of each day is for him to sit in front of his apartment window at 5 . 30pm and observe his ravishing neighbor as she goes to collect the letters in her mailbox . When he finally meets her in person ( following her OWN initiative ) , Roman loses his mind and kills her in brief a moment of rage and despair . Realizing the crime he committed , he punishes himself by staying indoors even more and ritually disposes of the girl's body parts every Sunday . The attractive new neighbor then develops a romantic interest in him , but she has issues and obsessions that even surpass those of Roman . Quite a few people blame " Roman " for its predictable ending but , even though I agree it's unsurprising , I didn't think it affected the film in a negative way . This film almost introduces a new type of predictability ! Although you know what's coming , you still somewhat hope that things will work out positively for Roman because , despite of what he did , he's a truly likable and pitiable character . Angela Bettis constantly maintains an extremely moody and harrowing atmosphere , and the film is literally stuffed with unconventional jokes and wickedly comical situations . The wholesome actually becomes a bit disturbing , because you just know people like Roman really exist ! Moreover , we all know someone in our own surrounding who rarely ever talks and always keeps a distance from the rest of the group . Makes you think what he / she does when nobody's watching , doesn't it ? The camera-work as well as the editing often looks ugly and amateurish , but personally I thought even this suited the tone of the film . The soundtrack is downright sublime and McKee receives great feedback from his two bewitching female co-stars Nectar Rose and Kristen Bell . Not for everyone , but highly recommended in case you have a weakness for atmosphere-driven and genuinely moving dramas .
405209	2020269	71650	7.0	Thorne's reign of sex and sadistic violence ?	Dyanne is the blouse-bursting prototype of a cult siren here in the Ilsa Series ? ' She wolf of the SS ' is a shocking ( at times downright nauseating ) exploitation tale , set in Nazi Camp 9 during Hitler's Third Reich-period . Ilsa is a perverted Nazi-officer with an insatiable sex hunger and a gruesome torture-fetish . Her camp is filled with innocent women and Ilsa performs sadistic ' medical ' experiments on them ? This results in some hard-to-watch sequences such as a girl who gets bath in water of 85 ( ! ) degrees Celsius ! Other poor victims are beaten to death by a whip , hung by their toes or infected with terrible diseases such as Syphilis . Female nudity appears on the screen every two seconds but you can hardly enjoy the looks of it , since the girls ' bodies are subjected to blood-soaked torturing and inhuman cruelty . Thorne clearly has fun in portraying the cold-hearted bitch and she proudly shows off with her oversized breasts . Following routine exploitation standards , this film has terrible acting , uninspired scenery and a weak direction but none of these aspects is top-priority , of course . She Wolf of the SS completely lives up to its infamous and vicious reputation and the cult value of this film is unimaginable . Two ' official ' sequels followed ( Ilsa ? Haremkeeper of the Oilsheiks and Tigress of Siberia ) . The Spanish cult-deity also shot a similar film with ' The Wicked Warden ' in which Thorne is called Greta . Not for the faint-hearted !
404527	2020269	366292	7.0	Leave your last words after the beep . . .	" One Missed Call " is an intense and surprisingly splatter-free thriller by Takashi Miike , creator of frenzy flicks such as " Ichi ? The Killer " and " MPD Psycho " . The film is involving and compelling right from the first minutes , as it introduces a group of identifiable young friends . Whilst in the bathroom , a girl's cell phone rings but she can't answer . The voice mail shows that the call came from her own number and from a date in the near future ! When listening to the actual voice mail , the message seems to carry the girl's last words and a disturbingly realistic recording of her deadfall . This mysteriously supernatural ritual repeats itself several times and each time the recipient actually dies on the predestined time ! More than enough reason to freak out , if you ask me ! A teenage girl and the brother of a deceased girl start to investigate the case and discover that everything relates to the strange Mizunuma family . Okay , I admit that this film's premise sounds an awful lot like " Ringu " ( even including the whole family-mystery ) , but I liked " One Missed Call " so much better than that dull and overrated " classic " . Miike's characters are more convincing , the death-sequences are far more spine-chilling and at least the set-pieces are up-to-date ! Japan is THE country of brand new technology and this finally is a movie that uses it ! No dusty videotapes here , but fancy cell phones and live television shows that exploit urban legends ! The story does get confusing at times ( especially near the ending ) and some of the overlong dialogue could easily have been cut . The biggest trumps are some small details that make this movie almost unbearably scary , like the petrifying ring tone that is used repeatedly and the wild camera-work during the TV-show sequence . Recommended ! Better watch it before the American remake ruins it again .
406616	2020269	36104	7.0	Beautiful darkness !	Perhaps not as mysteriously beautiful as " Cat People " or not as nightmarish as " The Body Snatcher " , but still this Val Lewton production equally is a solid horror milestone that should be viewed by everyone who wants to learn about the roots of atmospheric horror . The screenplay , adapted from the Woolich novel " Black Alibi " , is simple . . . yet powerful enough to provide the film with a good 60 minutes of pure tension . Soon after a leopard , hired from a traveling circus for a publicity stunt , escapes from a fancy nightclub , horribly mutilated bodies begin to turn up in a Mexican border town . Is the animal really tearing everyone on its path to pieces or is someone abusing the town's mass-hysteria to satisfy his / her own urge to kill ? Director Jacques Tourneur once again proves himself to be a master in creating an unbearably tense atmosphere . His excessive use of shadows and darkness turns the sets into ominous places while the constant unnatural sounds keep you alert for possible animal-attacks ! Who needs a budget when you've got this much talent and style ? " The Leopard Man " is an excellent film , one to watch preferably in series with " I walked with a Zombie " and " Curse of the Cat People " .
405546	2020269	129332	7.0	A story to chill the bones . . .	I love cinema . I mean , I truly LOVE cinema but sometimes you have the face the fact that it can be a pretty hypocrite business from time to time . Especially since the last ten years , everybody complains that there aren't any good horror movies being made . Only uninspired Scream clones and rip-off's . But that is a lie ! ! There are good and original thriller being made but they just don't get many attention because they are " politically incorrect " . Ravenous is a perfect example of this . Made in 1999 and it stars a few familiar faces but it went straight to video in my country and I never saw it advertised . That's a real shame because movies like this prove that there are still young directors active who're creative and talented . It's up to the fans to discover movies like this and ignore the overload of mainstream slashers . Ravenous has a very solid plot . simple but effective and supported by terrific acting performances . It shows a few of the darkest aspects of the human mind and , personally , I'm really intrigued by that . Subjects like Cannibalism and ancient Indian mythes are fascinating and when they're placed in a historical setting ( Mexican-American was of 1850 ) it even becomes better . This results in Ravenous being a very atmospheric and tense movie experience that you won't forget easily . The tension is built up slowly ( a bit too slow at first ) and the atmosphere of the cold and lonely Sierra Nevada is being portrayed very well . Guy Pierce is a great choice to play Captain John Boyd . His character is a cowardly figure with a complete lack of authority . He has to go through a battle himself and he's very messed up . The shows is obviously stolen by Robert Carlyle who is used to working with director Antonia Bird . His character is demonic and - duh - ravenous . A terrific performance and Carlyle manages to play his character with a lot of black humor and satanic charisma . David Arquette's role is pretty useless but it was great to see Jeffrey Jones again . Jones is a very decent actor and - even though he's frequently cast by Tim Burton - he's often overlooked and ignored . Ravenous is beautifully shot and some of the effects and make-up is pretty gruesome and explicit . But it isn't just mindless gore and violence so no complaints there . In fact , no complaints at all . . . . Ravenous is a breath-taking movie from beginning till end and a must for anyone who believes that the genre of horror is dead .
405818	2020269	75290	7.0	Real human misery meets Mexican exploitation	Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic " Alive " , there already was the legendary Mexican exploitation director René Cardona who used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film " Supervivientes de los Andes " . The unforgettable fatal flight of Fairchild 571 that crashed in the Argentinian Andes on October 13 , 1972 . This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers , most of them members of a professional rugby team . But 16 people of them were eventually rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate fellow-passengers . Of course you can't claim that this cheaply made and roughly edited film is better than the famous 90's version but I definitely appreciate and respect this film more . After all , an exploitation film demands a lot more input from both cast and crew while the big-budgeted Marshall film , although intense , feels more like routine money-making . The sets and special effects naturally can't compete with " Alive " , but " Supervivientes . . . " delivers an equally impressive sentiment of hopelessness and creates an even more nightmarish hell of snow . Cardona's film is ambitious , surprisingly compelling and easily one of the most remarkable Mexican productions ever . I am really astonished that Cardona's take on this story isn't more exploitative and explicit . The scenes where the deceased passengers are cut open and consumed are nevertheless hard to digest , but they only serve to increase the credibility of the catastrophe and to stress the inhuman conditions of the survivors . Rather praiseworthy for a vicious director who gained fame with his notoriously bad films like " Night of the Bloody Apes " and the Santo-series . The unknown young Mexican actors do a great job and the musical score is endearing . The story is well-known , of course , so the screenplay doesn't offer any unexpected shocks . Either by history or previously having seen " Alive " , you know which kind of dramas these people still have to endure before being rescued and you can only await them . Still , this is a good film that shouldn't be bashed like too often is the case .
405627	2020269	105690	7.0	Bad Guys Galore !	I remember , mostly back when it got released but even still now , dull critics and sour people in general simply categorized " Under Siege " as a lousy and uninspired version of " Die Hard " on a battleship instead of atop a skyscraper . Okay , this may very well be the most apt description imaginable , but that doesn't mean this movie can't awesome popcorn entertainment ! I usually restrain from writing about anything that isn't horror or cult cinema , but I gladly make exceptions for action flicks if they A ) are extremely violent and / or B ) feature highly memorable villainous characters . These two factors happen to be very well-presented in " Under Siege " . There's an enormous body count throughout the entire movie and the bad guys ? well ? they are simply what makes this film so darn enjoyable . I've never really been a fan of Steven Seagal and agree that if his role were to be played by Bruce Willis or perhaps even Sylvester Stallone the film could even be better , but it doesn't really matter all that much thanks to Colm Meaney , Gary Busey and Tommy Lee Jones . Particularly Busey as the treacherous and psychopathic commander and Jones as dangerously demented former special agent are so terrific that you'll often even forget Seagal wanders around the ship somewhere as well . A lot of mariners are gathered on the USS Missouri to attend a Pearl Harbour memorial but mostly to participate in the captain's birthday party afterwards . The ideal opportunity for greedy Cmdr . Krill ( Busey ) and a troop of mercenaries led by William Stranix to hijack the battleship and toy around with its huge arsenal of nuclear weaponry . One thing they didn't take into account , however , is the presence of the Captain's personal friend and acclaimed chef Casey Ryback . Ryback never really liked Krill ? maybe because the latter spat in his bouillabaisse ? ? and with his secret Navy SEAL past , the terrorists are up against an opponent much tougher than they bargained for . Exactly like it was the case in the aforementioned " Die Hard " , " Under Siege " benefits mostly from its claustrophobic and nearly inescapable setting . Director Andrew Davis admirably makes great use of the ship's dark interiors and ominous mechanical chambers by having his characters stroll around endlessly with their guns ready to fire away . This is definitely Steven Seagal's best film and it would have even been better if his character was a deaf-mute , or something ! His corny one-liners are terrible , but luckily he's often accompanied by the ravishing Baywatch babe Erika Eleniak ( who also treats us to a totally gratuitous but oh-so-welcome boobs shot ) or one of the baddies . Actually , I can't even be sure if this is Seagal's best film as I still haven't seen the majority of his not-so-impressive repertoire . I sincerely doubt , however , that straight-to-video productions like " Belly of the Beast " and " Urban Justice " can be any better than this modest action hit of the glorious early 90's .
406379	2020269	114194	7.0	The Army of Angels is all here . . . But where's God when you need him ?	" The Prophecy " is one of the better and undoubtedly one of the most ambitiously plotted horror movies of the 1990's . In a decade where most horror movies were mere uninspired imitations and / or sequels in franchises that already outstayed their welcome , writer / director Gregory Widen ( co-creator of the original " Highlander " ) comes up with a uniquely original and complex religious thriller dealing with fallen angels , the Second War in heaven , soul-sucking , angel autopsies and former priests turned cop slowly regaining the lost faith . The atmosphere of the film is pitch black and sinister and , even though there are copious opportunities to revert to a " simple " occult horror movie with a lot of gory killings and nasty images , Widen always makes sure the emphasis remains on coherent storytelling and characterizations . When inspector Thomas Daggett is called to the morgue to look at a super-human corpse , little does he know he's about to become involved in the greatest spiritual showdown in history . The Second War of Heaven has moved down to earth , with the ultra-malignant ( but über-cool ) fallen archangel Gabriel hunting down the evil soul of a deceased war criminal . If he takes possession of this soul , Gabriel is destined to win the battle upstairs , so the " good " angel Simon tries to prevent this by hiding the soul elsewhere . The plot , albeit obviously very fantastic and far-fetched , is intriguing and there are enough twists to keep you alert at all times . The character drawings are detailed and very well done , as you feel like you know enough about the evil characters as well as the good ones . Most amusing aspects about " The Prophecy " , however , are the really ingenious parts / gimmicks of the screenplay that aren't even that essential to the main story lines . For example , Gabriel requires a human assistant to drive him around and stuff , and for this job he uses suicide victims that are about to step into the light . This often leads to very funny situations . Another highlight is the appearance of no one less than Lucifer himself near the end of the movie . You see , there are a whole lot of angels ? good or bad ? present here ; the only party guest missing is God himself . The cast is overall splendid with terrific roles for Elias Koteas , Virginia Madsen , Eric Stoltz , Adam Goldberg and Viggo Mortensen . The absolute star of the entire " Prophecy " franchise , and especially this first and superior installment in particular , naturally is Christopher Walken . He's stupendous as Gabriel and continuously balances between blackly comical and genuinely petrifying . Walken is probably one of the only actors who can make you laugh and shiver with fear at the same time . Some of his one-liners here are simply priceless . Example ; when someone condemns him to hell , he arrogantly replies with " It's heaven ? The least you could do is getting the zip-code right " . Followed by two inferior sequels also starring Christopher Walken and two more that I haven't bothered to see yet .
405425	2020269	91166	8.0	100 % Testosterone-driven exploitation	THIS is a totally awesome , adrenalin rushing , down and dirty in-your-face 80's Italian exploitation effort , but of course you have to be cautious who you may recommend it to ! If you're , for example , attending a convention for people with an enormous IQ and you got a couple of hours to kill , you probably shouldn't suggest watching " Fists of Steel " because the script's intellectual value is rather questionable . Or in case you're a guest at a feminist gathering , I wouldn't advise mentioning " Fists of Steel " neither , as the film is literally stuffed with macho characters and typically male showdowns . In fact , to put it rather bluntly , " Fists of Steel " is a movie for guys , and preferably guys that like their heroes invincible , their women docile , their action & violence graphic & plentiful and their dialogs and story lines rudimentary . I'm not implying you have to be a retard in order to enjoy this film ( otherwise , I'd be one myself ) but it's merely a relaxing and undemanding film to watch after a hard day's work or together with a group of friends where there's loads of beer and pizza . " Fists of Steel " is basically an attempt to cash in on the huge success of James Cameron's " The Terminator " , but without the rather complex time-traveling structure and advanced character developments . In futuristic America , where acid rain hurtles down daily and breathing poisonous air may kill you , beefcake Cyborg Paco Querak is programmed to terminate a blind & crippled environmentalist whose movement is seriously annoying big-shot industrialist John Saxon . However , Paco's conscience prevents him from finishing the job and he flees into the Arizonan desert . He entrenches himself in a cheap & sleazy motel where he falls in love with the friendly owner , arm-wrestles against aggressive truckers and patiently awaits the army of hired killers to come after him . There isn't a single moment of dullness in this movie and I was actually sad when it finished . The arm wrestling contests are incredibly entertaining to behold ( muscles all over the screen ) , the car / truck / helicopter chases are extremely exciting and the fistfights are so harsh you can almost feel them . Daniel Greene is more than adequate in his heroic Cyborg-role but the supportive cast is even better with the almighty John Saxon as the über-bad guy , George Eastman as the jealous lead-trucker and Claudio Cassinelli ( who sadly died during shooting ) as one of the relentless hit men . Cassinelli's untimely death clearly caused a scripting problem , as his character is killed off screen . As always , Sergio Martino's direction is fast-paced and competent but nothing more than that . He was one of Italy's busiest and most versatile directors during the 60's , 70's and 80's , so don't expect too much typical trademarks or personalized styles as he just wanted to finish the job quick and proper . Claudio Simonetti , the multi-talented brain behind cult band Goblin , was in charge of the music and that's another reason for avid fans of Italian exploitation film to track this puppy down . Great testosterone-driven entertainment , love it or hate it !
405630	2020269	780622	8.0	Watch out boy , she'll chew you up . . .	Writer / director Mitchell Lichtenstein at least deserves some sort of symbolic award for coming up with one of the most original and refreshing new horror concepts of the last 10-15 years . In a time and era where the horror genre is dominated by remakes of older classics and vile torture-porn movies , Lichtenstein thought up an old-fashioned and tongue-in-cheek parody with mythological influences and a small-town-folks atmosphere . " Teeth " is a splendid little film and of the most pleasant surprises I encountered in a long while , especially because it successfully blends comedy and nostalgia with a handful of disturbing themes and uncanny gore effects . " Teeth " isn't the textbook title for the umpteenth wannabe eccentric vampire movie , but a modern day processing of the Vagina Dentata myth , which handles about women with teeth inside their vagina in order to scare off random men whilst waiting for the one right hero . Dawn's teenage years aren't the easiest ones . She lives with her terminally ill mother , stepfather and insufferably rebellious stepbrother Brad in a remote little town . She's a devoted believer of sexual abstinence and even encourages her fellow schoolmates to wait with sex until marriage . Her own principles are heavily challenged when she meets and falls for new kid in town Tobey , but she still manages to control her desires . Tobey can't , however , and he painfully experiences Dawn's physically build-in defense mechanism . The poor girl's in shock when she first sees the effect , naturally , but she gradually learns to use it as a protective tool against all the abusive and malignant men out there . The Vagina Denteta folklore tale mixes terrifically with the more typical drama themes in this film , namely the ' coming of age ' chronicles and the ' dysfunctional family ' portrait . This really isn't just another random horror movie , but a wide variety of relevant and identifiable stories with loads of genuine fears and sentiments . Dawn's abstinence beliefs as well as her mental restrictions and problematic family situation are extendedly portrayed before the toothed vagina even plays a role in the script . Once the first victim is castrated , " Teeth " definitely becomes more a more light-headed , gruesome and fast-paced film . Although definitely not being the bloodiest movie ever made , " Teeth " is likely to make a lot of ( male ) viewers squirm and squeal in their seats ! The castration sequences are quite uncomfortable and they gradually more sadist . For obvious reasons the toothed vagina never gets shown , but I imagine it to look somewhat like the jaws of the Kraken monster that attacked Johnny Depp at the end of " Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man's Chest " . The young cast is stupendous , particularly Jess Weixler as Dawn and John Hensley as her messed up stepbrother , and the film is literally crammed with unique little jokes and witty observations . For example , it's emphasized numerous times that Dawn and her family lives very near to a nuclear plant , and you're almost forced to assume the pollution will have something to do with the girl's condition , yet it's never confirmed or even hinted at any further . " Teeth " is a very good and innovative new film and comes highly recommended to all open-minded fans of cinema .
406179	2020269	77904	8.0	Tumors Are a Girl's Best Friend	Demented , preposterous , gloriously grotesque ? William Girdler's " The Manitou " truly epitomizes all reasons why low-keyed rip-off's of 70's horror classics are often much more entertaining and worthwhile than the originals themselves . This is basically a variation on " The Exorcist " ( although undeniably an imaginative one ) , with familiar reoccurring themes like supernatural possession , the drivel of unknown languages and the inevitable battle of good versus evil . In spite of Girder's attempts to maintain a serious atmosphere and despite the fact the script is adapted from an acclaimed novel written by Graham Masterson , " The Manitou " is one of the craziest films I've ever beheld . The main premise , which I'll describe slightly more detailed hereunder , is already quite ridicule , but then the screenplay also features traitorous Tarot Card readers , elderly ladies throwing themselves down a flight of stairs , explosive séances , senile anthropologists and a totally misfit end-moral that " love " conquers all types of evil . Karen Tandy , a friendly young woman who never harmed anyone in her life , consults a specialized doctor regarding a nasty lump in her neck , which grows at an alarmingly fast rate and even appears to be moving from time to time . Perplexed with the testing results , the doctors have to acknowledge that , instead of a tumor , there is actually a fetus growing on poor Karen's neck ! Not the ' oh , look at the cute baby'-type of fetus , but the reincarnation of a 400-year-old and malicious Native American medicine man ! Yikes ! The doctors attempt to remove it , but the Indian fella - Misquamacus , or something like that - naturally sabotages the operations . Meanwhile , Karen's ex-lover and non-believing Tarod Card reader Harry seeks the help of genuine modern day medicine man John Singing Rock for the inevitably upcoming exorcism rituals . Okay , quite wacky stuff thus far , but the script goes completely bonkers AFTER Misquamacus emerges from his lumpy home . Eventually the great , almighty Indian Manitou simply turns out to be a miserable midget with one glass eye and one helluva bad temper ! Misquamacus can summon monstrous lizards and even Satan himself , yet he's unable to break through a simple circle of sand and the " spirit " of an ordinary typewriter knocks him KO . The climax centers on one major hilarious hocus-pocus battle in an improvised cosmic environment . I know it sounds like the oldest cliché saying in the book , but you simply have to see it in order to believe your eyes . " The Manitou " is a masterpiece of pure camp . The special effects are pretty dazzling , and that even includes the colorful fireworks during the finale , there's not a single moment of boredom and acting performances are far better than they have any right to be . Heck , the whole film is worth recommending if it were for Burgess Meredith's awesome cameo as the confused anthropologist alone . The set pieces , scenery and locations are just as berserk as the plot , as the hospital is full of awkward machinery that doesn't seem to have any medical functions at all . They're just there because they have colorful lights and look sophisticated . And William Girdler clearly loved the Golden Gate Bridge , because the film is stuffed with postcard images and extended pan shots of it . This last paragraph is entirely dedicated to William Girdler , because the story of his career is at least as tragically and saddening as " The Manitou " is entertaining . Girdler was clearly horror-obsessed at young age already and remained extremely busy during the next six years of his well-filled but painfully too short career . He delivered his directorial debut at age 25 , with the gritty redneck-horror flick " Three on a Meathook " in 1972 , but then he quickly specialized in cashing in on contemporary popular trends in the horror industry . He made his very own violent-cop-above-the-law flick ( " The Zebra Killer " ) , as well as Blaxploitation films ( " Sheba , Baby " , " Abby " ) and a Satanic Cult movie ( " Asylum of Satan " ) . His most famous film , apart from " The Manitou " , is the notorious Jaws-on-land classic " Grizzly " and stayed in the animals-versus-humans area with " Day of the Animals " . As incomprehensible as it may sound , Girdler never received the praise and recognition he deserved . " The Manitou " would become one of the highest grossing films of the year 1978 and his breakthrough accomplishment but , ironically enough , he didn't even live to experience the premiere on the big screen . William Girdler died at the tender age of 30 , when his helicopter crashed whilst spotting locations for already another film . With NINE fine movies in just 6 years , imagine what he could have achieved if he hadn't sat foot in that helicopter ?
405498	2020269	35009	8.0	Kitsch , a Werewolf and an utterly mad scientist ! What more could you wish for ?	This is a really cool movie and , no ? I'm not joking ! The Mad Monster is a pleasant and fairly original camp-film obviously trying to pick in on the Universal Monster successes . But who cares if it can't live up to the preciously wealthy production values of those films ? I sure don't and especially not since it features werewolves and insane men of science which are my two top favorite horror topics ! It stars the infamous B-movie legend George Zucco as the very devoted ? but equally insane ? scientist Dr . Cameron who got banned from the academic community because of his unethical and inhuman experiments . Cameron plots a violent vengeance on those who discredited them and with his groundbreaking new formulas he manages to turn his slightly retarded gardener into a ravenous werewolf . While his cute daughter is unaware of what happens in her father's lab , Cameron sends out his creation to devour his scientific competitors . I can't stress this enough : this film is fun ! Not very scary , of course , and the werewolf-transformations & killings mostly happen off-screen . And even when they do make an attempt to use special effects or make up it looks really cheap and kitschy . So , lovers of new-age computerized gore should avoid this at all costs . Zucco is really terrific and the madness can be seen in his eyes throughout the entire film ! He even holds imaginary meetings in his basement , trying to convince the world his visions are brilliant ! I love this ; Zucco surely ranks amongst cinema's most memorable demented doctors . Glenn Strange also was an outstanding casting choice to play the not-so-clever guinea pig . Strange looks an awful lot like Lon Chaney Jr . who made himself immortal one year before by playing ? . The Wolf Man ! If you're intrigued by undiscovered horror gems , werewolf horror films or just ordinary cult-amusement this is your film ! Highly recommended !
406712	2020269	83739	8.0	Take A Look At My Face , I Am The Future !	Right from the opening minutes already , when the legendary Alice Coopers croons the cheesy but catchy and oh so apt punk-rock theme song " I Am The Future " , you just know this will be a genuine and unhinged classic in the field of 80's trash / exploitation cinema . The eighties were relatively more civilized & polished , but luckily enough " Class of 1984 " is deliciously old-fashioned and very 70's ; meaning shamelessly gratuitous and raunchy ! Supposedly this is a modern update of an acclaimed 50's movie called " The Blackboard Jungle " starring Glenn Ford and Vic Morrow , but ? even without having seen the original version - I heavily suspect the juvenile delinquents of that film to look like angelic choirboys in comparison with the psychopathic and anarchistic punk-kids of Lincoln High in " Class of 1984 " . This is more like a mingling between " A Clockwork Orange " , " Death Wish " and " The Warriors " , but all set within the walls of an everyday American high school in a not-so-distant future . The ambitious and idealistic music teacher Andy Norris starts his new career at Lincoln High , but immediately notices that the entire school lives under the terrorist reign of gifted thug Peter Stegman and his gang of crazy lackeys . The more Mr . Norris attempts to make the school a safe and educational environment again , the more vicious and personal Stegman's reprisals become . Rather than opting for the boring Michelle Pfeiffer approach , our teacher realizes that only way to oppress authority is by fighting back . The coolest thing about " Class of 1984 " is unquestionably how campy , OTT and wannabe sensationalistic it is . The opening sequences want to make us believe that the entire school is an uncontrollable wasteland ( with security devices at the entrance and vulgar graffiti everywhere ) even though there's only just one tiny gang of five punks running amok . All the other pupils are goody-two-shoes like , for example , a nerdy Michael J . Fox in one of his first film roles . Another classic yet grotesquely absurd scene shows how a student goes completely bonkers and climbing up a flagpole after snorting just a tad bit of drugs ! The absolute dementia highlight of " Class of 1984 " is when overstressed biology teacher Roddy McDowall hysterically teaches an entire class at gunpoint ! The DVD that I own ? released in 2004 - opens with a spoken intro from Mark Lester in which he declares that " Class of 1984 " is a prophetic film . This statement might just be a little exaggerated , but it is nevertheless one of the most entertaining , uncompromising and messed up movies of the glorious 80's decade .
404697	2020269	53219	8.0	Surprisingly GREAT sequel	Granted , I initially feared that this film would be disastrous and a complete waste of time . All the available indicators pointed out that it was just an attempt to cash in on the huge success of the original " The Fly " , release not even a year before : quickly scripted , re-using sets and scenery of the original and the plot sounded too much like a repeating of the events occurring in the first . Well , I'm more than happy to announce that I couldn't be more wrong ! " Return of the Fly " is an excellent film and definitely worthy of its classic predecessor . It already opens terrific , with grim images of the funeral of Helene Delambre , the heroine of the first film . Her brother-in-law François is forced to tell Helene's son Philippe about the tragedy that overcame his father all those years ago . The fade of his father encourages Philippe ? a devoted scientist as well ? to continue and finish his work , accompanied by a friend and François himself . I won't spoil what happens next , as it's too different from what you expect and certainly worth fining out yourself . " Return of the Fly " is a great film for multiple reasons . First and foremost , there's the more extended role of Vincent Price . I can't explain what it is about him , but his inimitable charisma makes every movie he stars in a must-see and his monologues ( although often about tedious substance ) are compelling beyond words . Whatever he speaks about I hang on Vincent Price's lips ! Another reason to state this film's greatness is the ingenious use of multiple subplots . Aside being a cool sci-fi adventure , the " Return of the Fly " - script also focuses on typical human greed , betrayal and phobias / ghosts from the past . For some reason ( budget-related , perhaps ? ) it's entirely filmed in black and white , while the original was in color . That's hardly an obstacle , though , since it increases the eerie atmosphere immensely . Besides , the make-up effects are a lot more repellent in this sequel , so the lack of color also neutralizes the effect of the nasty " human fly " images . The ending comes rather abrupt , unfortunately and it's my own personal opinion that Brett Halsey can't handle the leading role David Hedinson did in the first . Luckily , there's the almighty Vincent Price for the good acting and the incredibly beautiful Danielle De Metz as eye-candy . In conclusion : you won't hear me say that " Return of ? " outshines the original milestone , but it equally is a must for genre fans and I can't deny that it was more fun to watch . Highest possible recommendation !
404898	2020269	940723	8.0	Respectable Belgian horror	My beloved Belgium country hasn't got much of an impressive history when it comes to horror cinema , but at least there have always been enthusiast and visionary directors that tried to make a difference . Back in the 70's there was Harry Kümel ( whose movies " Malpertuis " and " Daughters of Darkness " are highly desired and acclaimed cult-collector items nowadays ) , then there's Jan Verheyen ( who also hosts horror movie screenings on Belgian TV ) and since recently we have Pieter Van Hees . Van Hees is an extremely devoted fan of the genre , as it is illustrated in his absurdly grotesque and engrossing short movie " Black XXX-Mas " as well as in this slow-brooding and atmospheric thriller " Linkeroever " . The title literally means Left Bank and refers to a very well known living area in Antwerp . It's a reputedly " troubled " area since the Middle Ages already , with dark historical secrets and mysterious inhabitants , and thus the ideal setting for a sinister story . Marie is a young and talented but introvert athlete who suddenly falls ill and gets forced to cancel her participation in a prominent European tournament . She moves in with her new boyfriend Bobby and , mostly out of boredom , begins to investigate the mysterious unsolved disappearance of the previous tenant . I don't want to reveal too much about the complex and extremely unsettling story , but the script hints at horrific elements such as human sacrifices , reincarnation , pagan rites , excommunication , witches and super massive black holes . " Linkeroever " is basically a typical folklore tale , but set in a present day social environment and decorated with style & content elements that are borrowed from similarly-themed international horror classics like " The Wicker Man " , " Blood on Satan's Skin " and " Rosemary's Baby " . Pieter Van Hees generates a depressing and constantly grim atmosphere through simple tricks ( autumn weather conditions , pauperized living areas ? ) and patiently takes the time to unfold the story and draw detailed character portraits . The denouement isn't that difficult to predict ? especially not when you have experience with occult horror ? but it nevertheless evokes a handful of genuine chills and nightmarish afterthoughts . Considering the fairly low budget and overall tense ambiance of the film , you shouldn't hope for a lot of bloodshed , though . Van Hees could rely on a professional crew as well . The photography , editing and musical guidance are damn close to brilliant and , following good old Belgian traditions , the film contains several dared but tasteful and quintessential sex sequences . Eline Kuppens is simply fantastic in her screen debut and she carries the entire motion picture like it's the easiest job in the world . She's a natural beauty with the talent and perseverance to make it even in the international film industry . Kuppens receives excellent support from the handsome young actor Matthias Schoenaerts and a couple of Flemish TV-screen veterans like Marilou Mermans , Frank Vercruyssen and Sien Eggers . Recommended for anyone who can speak the language and fundamental viewing for all Belgian film freaks .
404296	2020269	14142	8.0	Beautiful ? but I hope you have a wide attention span !	This early version of the legendary story is ( so far ) the oldest film I've ever seen . Personally , I find it fascinating to purchase movies made before my grandparents were even born . The entire concept of cinema as a form of art is scarcely out of the egg it all still looks so grotesque . I did learn something from this film ? these ancient milestones aren't necessarily brilliant but impressive beyond belief . The Hunchback of the Notre Dame often gets referred to as one of the first ? horror ' classics but much more than that , it's a historical spectacle with massive sets and groundbreaking elements . The actual plot is so easy to summarize but you get so much more than that ! Like a very detailed and imaginative portrait of Paris in the 15th century , the variety of social classes and an idea of medieval interpretation of the law . At some times in this film , you almost get the idea Quasimodo and Esmeralda are just second-class puppets in what is primarily a historical and educating documentary . Magnificent without a single doubt ? but time-consuming and ponderous to sit through ? Although , I have to say I hunt down the extended version , furnished with a stained musical track and lasting 140 minutes . The actual plot and the presentation of Quasimodo's personality is still unparalleled and touching beyond comparison . Lon Chaney is simply outstanding as the unworldly and deformed ? freak ' who's willing to sacrifice his life unconditionally to rescue the girl who once treated him in a human way . He might be hideous , but he's the only who's pure , honest and free of prejudices . Lon Chaney's facial make-up and hunch are early horror triumphs . Along with his natural charismatic appearance , the Quasimodo portrayal provided Chaney with the immortal status of horror-cinema icon . Even though he already starred in over a hundred films before The Hunchback , he'll always be remembered starting from this point of his career . Like none other actor , Chaney gave a face to Quasimodo and that is not exaggerated ! Multiple other well-respected actors gave image to Quasimodo after Chaney ( like Charles Laughton , Anthony Quinn and Anthony Hopkins ) but only he will truly be remembered for it . Same goes for Lon's personification of Erik in ' Phantom of the Opera ' which is his greatest achievement in cinema along with Hunchback . The Hunchback of the Notre Dame is over eighty ( 80 ! ) years old now and it still stands as one of the most overwhelming heavyweights in cinema ever . Some of the sequences shown here are pure mythical inheritance . Like Chaney acrobatic movements while tolling the massive bells ? or his descent off the Notre Dame's walls ! Still , this film might not be for all tastes as it's too bombastic all together and Woresly's direction is kind of rough and ponderous . He surely put too much energy in it , as it was the most ambitious project of his career . Therefore , it's hard to stay focused continuously as the shots of Medieval Parisian streets seem to be endless
405155	2020269	55456	8.0	Hey there , sssssssssssssssssssexy !	Fans of atmospheric and story-driven 60's horror all over the world should urgently combine forces and catapult " The Snake Woman " out of oblivion and into the list of favorites ! Despite the compelling storyline and an acclaimed director in the credits ( Sidney J . Furie ) , this early 60's chiller incomprehensibly got neglected over the years , whereas other ? much worse ? horror films from that period received unnecessary fancy DVD-releases . This is a solid thriller , filmed in stylish black & white and filled with fluently written dialogues . The events take place during the late 19th century in a little Northern English town inhabited by superstitious and easily petrified people . Since many years , a brilliant scientist successfully keeps his wife's mental illness under control by injecting her with snake venom . When the wife dies whilst giving birth to a daughter , a local witch claims that the newborn child is pure evil and must be destroyed . The scientist is killed by an angry mob but the baby girl is miraculously saved with the help of an understanding doctor . 19 years later several corpses are found in the Moors , containing a lethal amount of snake poison . The frightened villagers believe that the curse of the snake woman has struck them , but the young Scotland Yard inspector doesn't believe in old-fashioned witchery and investigates the case . Sidney J . Furie impressively manages to maintain the mysterious atmosphere throughout the entire film and makes great use of the rural locations and spirit of the era . You can truly sense the fear of the villagers when they're confronted with yet another new murder and their belief in the supernatural , voodoo and evil curses is impeccably portrayed . The subject matter of venom and reptiles in general apparently got researched in detail . For example , the snake girl has no eyelids , she's highly sensitive to certain sounds and she regularly sheds her skin . It's little details like this that make mythological horror so great ! My only complaints are that the movie is too short ( runtime 68 minutes ) and that there isn't enough background to Atheris ' ( the snake woman ) character . What happened to her in those 19 years ? Does she hold a grudge against the town or does she just kill by instinct ? The acting performances are very adequate and the paranoia end sequences are typically 60's . This baby just screams for a proper DVD-release !
406176	2020269	67224	8.0	Ain't No Party Like Hackman's Hunting Party !	Why this film is still so obscure and unknown goes beyond my ? admittedly limited ? comprehension . It has a good plot , albeit obviously a response to " The Wild Bunch " and basically just another ( western ) interpretation of the legendary classic " The Most Dangerous Game " , the cast is excellent with both Gene Hackman and Oliver Reed in great shape and there's plenty of rough and gritty violence . The filming locations are exquisite and ? possibly to further cash in on the success of Italian Spaghetti westerns ? the producers even hired and Italian composer . Riz Ortolani's music is definitely one of the best elements about the film . Gene Hackman was never as vicious as here in this movie , portraying Brandt Ruger ; a rich , obnoxious and egocentric bank owner who enjoys throwing hunting parties for his selected circle of equally depraved and wealthy friends . When a posse of bandits , led by the ever handsome Oliver Reed , kidnaps his wife , Brandt alters the route of their planned hunting trip and goes after them . Not so much because he loves his wife ( played by the ravishing Candice Bergen ) , as he actually neglects and abuses her all the time , but because he's Brandt Ruger and nobody is supposed to touch what belongs to him . Ruger gets crazier and more determined to raise a bloodbath with each minute that passes , whilst his wife and her abductor fall in love . Hackman's character is truly the nastiest and most hateful type of villain there is : relentless , mad and unpredictable , but also cowardly as he continuously avoids confrontation with his opponents and shoots them from a safe distance with his technically advanced riffle . " The Hunting Party " is slightly overlong and contains a handful of tedious sequences , notably the romantic parts and the whole sub plot revolving on Melissa learning her kidnapper how to read . Still , there's always some type of ominous atmosphere , since you expect Gene and his docile accomplices to pop up out of nowhere at any given moment . The climax is very powerful , haunting and even quite depressing . The action is of course rather monotonous , since we exclusively witness people getting shot , but the images of cowboys dying in slow motion ( and bathing in blood ) are gritty and exploitative . The three leads are amazing and " The Hunting Party " comes with my highest possible recommendation if it were only for witnessing the final showdown between Reed and Hackman , two of the greatest actors that ever lived .
404578	2020269	339291	8.0	A series of wonderfully sinister events !	Please , don't make the same mistake as me and my girlfriend and postpone your viewing of " Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events " simple because it looks too much like a children's film . Although younger audiences may be the priority target group , this film definitely isn't childish and actually a lot scarier and more sinister than most nowadays horror films ! Not gross or violent , of course , but authentically grim and macabre like a real fairy-tale ought to be ! Here in Europe , we aren't very familiar with the books of Daniel Handler ( Lemony Snicket ) but , even by judging this film alone , I dare to say that his work appeals to me a lot more than for example Harry Potter or the latest Pixar movies . The story centers on three adorable and gifted children who're abruptly orphaned when their parents die in a mysterious fire . Their search for a new home and well-meaning new guardians is constantly interfered by the malicious Count Orlaf ( Jim Carrey ) who hunts after the Bauedelaires ' family fortune . The main reason why this film is so genuinely unsettling is because the story relentlessly uncovers the deepest fear of every child , namely the death of parents and the large risk of ending up with ill-natured new guardians . Most fairy-tale don't even dare to bring up this nightmarish idea , but " Lemony Snicket . . . " entirely revolves around it . Equally effective are , of course , the ghoulish landscapes , the dark scenery and the amazingly eccentric characters . Most of the time , it feels like you're watching a typical Tim Burton film and that's a giant compliment , since his style is practically unique ( sinister , witty and heart-warming all at once ! ) . There's a lot of CGI but it's not annoying for once , since all these exaggeratedly fake special effects ( the leeches , Aunt Josephine's seaside-house ) contribute to the wonderfully morbid atmosphere . The cast is terrific as well , with Jim Carrey as Count Orlaf in one most memorable performances to date . I have to admit I initially feared that Carrey's performance would be far over-the-top , but he's surprisingly mature and convincing . The Bauedelaire-children are very well cast as well and so are Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep in the most important supportive roles . The great cast is completed with respectable names ( Luiz Guzmán , Catherine O'Hara , Jennifer Coolidge . . . ) in small roles . Sublime film , highly recommended for all type of audiences !
405863	2020269	71391	8.0	Ah , the mentally insane . . . you gotta love ' em !	( Small SPOILERS ) It's such a shame that this film wasn't produced by the Hammer studios ( or Amicus ? or maybe Tigon ) , because if that were the case , it probably wouldn't be so underrated and overlooked as it is now . Dark Places has suspense , a professional director , a great cast and ? especially ? a truly cool plot . Asylum administrator Edward ( Robert Hardy ) ' inherits ' the large mansion of a deceased patient . The legend says he hid a fortune somewhere in the walls of this house but he also went mad there after the murder on his wife , his two children and the governess . Edward begins the search for the lost money but there are more rivals in the field . The town's doctor ( Christopher Lee ) and his ravishing sister ( Joan Collins ) constantly try to intrude the house and even the seemly honest notary ( Herbert Lom ) becomes greedy ? but then , the house itself becomes the biggest threat . As you can read , this film offers great excitement . Asylums , treasure-hunting and haunted houses ! What more could a Brit horror-fanatic possibly ask for ? The tense climax is terrifically built up and the film features quite a lot gore considering the time it was shot . The budget is low and the project obviously lacks efficient make-up effects . But the wholesome is very atmospheric and quite original so I don't really care if it doesn't look too convincing . ' Dark Places ' was directed by Don Sharp , who previously made the Hammer classic ' Rasputin : the Mad Monk ' and several other great horror titles , such as ' Psychomania ' ( very underrated as well ) , ' The Brides of Fu Manchu ' and ' Kiss of the Vampire ' . Robert Hardy plays an excellent double-role , while Lee and Lom look as ghoulish as ever . The nearly perfect cast is completed by two stunningly beautiful actresses : Joan Collins and Jane Birkin . In case you're a devoted Hammer fan , or just an admirer of ghostly 70's stories , Dark Places is the ideal film for you . Severely underrated horror fun !
404235	2020269	82776	8.0	High-Caliber cult !	Neneh Cherry already specifically stated in a song that this is a woman's world , so who are we to argue with that ? Women RULE this world , whether they carry around . 45 caliber guns or not ? Infamous cult movie director Abel Ferrara's interpretation of feminism revolves on a mute and seemly defenseless young beauty that wipes male scum from the face of the earth with a pistol . After being the victim of assault and attempted rape TWICE in one afternoon , Thana kills her second assailant and chops up his corpse in the bathtub . Whilst getting rid of the bagged body parts , she randomly kills numerous other men on the trash-filled streets of New York . " Ms . 45 " has quite a lot in common with Ferrara's breakthrough film " the Driller Killer " , except that it doesn't contain so many tedious moments and that you actually have sympathy for the Thana character , whereas Reno Miller could die instantly for all I cared . Strictly talking from a cinematic point of view , " Ms . 45 " is a much better film than " Driller Killer " as well . Ferrara manages to retain his depressing yet realistic portrait of dead-end New York , but the camera-work is much more steady and versatile . Zoë Lund , who remarkably looks like Nastassja Kinski , is a terrific anti-heroine and the fact she plays a mute even increases the complexity of her character . Lund later co-wrote " Bad Lieutenant " before sadly passing away at the young age of 37 , due to heart failure . Unfortunately , however , " Ms . 45 " didn't stand the test of time very well . The graphic violence and definitely the controversy has been surpassed severely nowadays and I sincerely doubt that the new Playstation-generation will be impressed by Ferrara's take on the explicit revenge-flick trend . Luckily selected group of film buffs including myself still consider this to be a quintessential cult gem that'll live on forever . Kill ' em all , Thana !
406415	2020269	385993	8.0	Great , great , GREAT ! Hooray for rancid exploitation !	Paul Naschy , star of an innumerable amount of Spanish exploitation classics ( including the " Hombre-Lobo " cycle ) returns in this wondrously bizarre and imaginative film that premiered at the International Festival of Fantasy Films . I'm pretty convinced that " Rojo Sangre " won't be very successful and that's a damn shame because it finally is a truly odd and eccentric Spanish horror effort again , and the fans have seen far too few of these recently . The premise is a variant on the legendary " Faust " tale but , as much as every other aspect in this film , it's a very VERY demented take on Goethe's classic story . Naschy shines as the veteran actor-in-low-water Pablo Thevenet . He despises the young generation of actors and actresses for being untalented and he's frustrated about the fact that new and arrogant casting directors don't know him . Desperate for work , he accepts a job as a living sculpture in a fancy brothel ran by extravagant people . But something seems to have snapped in Pablo's head and he starts a violent killing spree , focusing on those who were responsible for artistic downfall . The plot really gets complex when Pablo's employers turn out to be unworldly and ultimately messed up . The story doesn't make much sense half of the time ( and the other half is downright confusing ) but still you love what you see because it's so vivid and nostalgic . You fancy yourself back into the glorious days of euro-exploitation and that's a feeling I personally missed enormously . " Rojo Sangre " features a lot of old-fashioned sleaze , good music and adorably insane characters ( a transsexual business lady or a millionaire snuff-fanatic , anyone ? ? ) . The dialogues are exceptionally well-written and the cinematography is astonishingly beautiful ! It actually doesn't look leak a cheap exploitation film at all , as the camera-work is ingenious and the visuals are very creative . The gore and make-up effects aren't as outrageous as I expected ( or hoped ! ) them to be , but there certainly are a couple of marvelous gruesomeness-highlights , including nasty images of a cut up corpse , multiple stabbings and professionally slit throats ! Despite the devastating material , the screenplay also makes room for genuine black comedy and a couple of very comical anecdotes . The film opens with one , when Pablo gives a detailed description of his bizarre sexual fetish ! That sequence is hilarious and you already consider " Blood Red " a success before it even properly begun ! Paul Naschy is brilliant as Pablo Thevenet ( it might even be his best performance ever ) and maybe that's because he really feels related to his character's situation . No worries Paul , I can assure you that the godly Paul Naschy is still worshiped by a limited group of cult-lovers ! Watch " Blood Red " when you've got the chance !
404954	2020269	386005	8.0	Lifestyles of the Rich and Gamers	It's almost tragic to establish that in Hollywood Jackie Chan exclusively gets cast to appear in lame action-comedies ( like " The Tuxedo " and " Rush Hour " ) , whilst in his home country of Hong Kong he's at least righteously offered to play serious roles and to be a genuine hard-fighting icon of action movies . " New Police Story " is everything but comical , it's a harsh and hardcore-to-the-bone cop thriller with an extreme overload of violent shootouts , dazzling stunts and relentless executions . The story is fairly original and adapted to the new type of crime-waves representing the post-2000 era , with Chan playing the cop who's up against an entirely new breed of villains : bored and spoiled rich kids obsessed with video games and committing violence purely for kicks . The youthful gang members inventively rob banks even though they don't need the money , have an insatiable appetite for destruction and ? oh yeah ? they really hate cops . When inspector Chan is a little too confident on TV about catching the thugs , they set up an ambush to sadistically slaughter Chan's entire team . The pain and guilt of losing his team drives Chan to drink heavily and neglect his police work , but a younger colleague slowly convinces him to solve the case and avenge his dead team-members . Like most Asian productions , " New Police Story " is rather long for an action film ( slightly over 2 hours ) but it's never boring or unnecessarily sentimental , not even during the relatively long period when inspector Chan mourns over his departed friends and colleagues . The action sequences and stunts are downright sensational ; the highlight being an excessively destructive bus-out-of-control scene through the crowded streets of Hong Kong . " New Police Story " in an almost non-stop and adrenalin-rushing series of spectacular stunts , but it's also very praiseworthy for Jackie Chan's tour-de-force acting performance . This is his first film in which his acting talent is actually a lot more impressive than his fabulous martial arts skills . Especially the sequences in which his character stumbles through dark alleys at night , incredibly drunk and heart-broken , are harrowing and very realistic . Grim , sadistic violence and real drama are very difficult themes to mix together , but this film seemly pulls it off without too much trouble . " New Police Story " isn't intended for the faint-hearted , but if you like your heroes invincible , your criminals ultra-evil and your action rough & explicit , this film comes with my highest possible recommendation .
404476	2020269	21884	9.0	Monster movie Numero Uno	God , how much I wanted to be there back in 1931 when this film got released . The hype of it , the horror . . . that would have been amazing . It's over 70 years old now and it still remains the strongest , most powerful monster film ever made . This film means a lot to me , but it especially means respect ! Respect for the creators , the incredible cast ( Boris Karloff will always be the creature . Even in another 70 years ) and the special effects creators . The atmosphere hanging around this movie is absolutely amazing . The images of the dark and mysterious windmill still makes your blood pump faster . The loud and vicious thunder never cease to frighten you . . . You can't afford to call yourself a horror freak before watching the originals . Like Bela Lugosi as Dracula , Like Lon Chaney as the Wolf man and . . . Like Boris Karloff as the Creature of Frankenstein . This film was the beginning of what will become a huge and fantastic genre in cinema and therefore I think everyone should see it . Multiple Times ! ! ! ! My humble opinion on Frankenstein . . .
404778	2020269	248752	9.0	Outstanding comedy for people with no morals	Denis Leary , the greatest stand-up comedian in the history of stand-up comedy ( of course , in the humble opinion of yours truly ) delivers his best work with this No Cure For Cancer show . This is an unscrupulous spitfire of criticism on topics that no other normal person dares to process . The opening announcement summarizes the wholesome quite well actually : " Ladies and gentleman , due to illness , the part of Denis Leary will be played by ? Denis Leary ! " . With the biggest disdain in his voice and body language , Leary talks ( yells , actually ) about out-of-the-question topics such as drug-abuse , rehabilitation programs and even cancer . Short examples include him claiming drug abuse is something you simply have to experience , or that all rock stars belong dead or even that cancer is something you should be proud of ! I especially enjoyed his on-going rant on dreadful anti-smoking campaigns ! He's standing there , lighting one cigarette after another , and shouting he is never going to quit ! Go Denis ! ! The style of comedy Leary brings isn't exactly the " rollin ' over the floor laughing your ? off " humor but merely the kind of gags you secretly giggling with , not really knowing whether you're supposed to find it funny or not . He also goes over the top quite a few times , but you forgive him simply because he's so fanatic in what he does . For example : he nearly goes berserk when venting his spleen on the French people and , even though his lines aren't very admirable , it's still terrific amusement due to his on-stage behavior . I think every person on this planet would be offended by at least one chapter in this show . So you better leave all your morals and principles at the door before you start watching it . But , if you got any sense of sarcasm in you , this show is a must !
405903	2020269	910548	9.0	I ate his PENIS ? with some Fava-beans and a nice Chianti	Well , here you have it . . . The most grueling , sickening , disturbing , controversial , unbelievable and shocking horror movie EVER made , and yet it's all real . " Cannibal " is the ideal motion picture to state that the hard facts of reality will always surpass fiction . If this film had simply sprung from the imaginative mind of any random horror scriptwriter , it probably would have been laughed at , because surely nothing as vile , grotesque and far-fetched like this is ever likely to happen in our sophisticated society , right ? The factual case of Rohtenburg cannibal Armin Meiwes is unquestionably one of the most perplexing crime cases in the history of mankind and , even though you know it's all true , you're often still staring at the screen in total disbelief . Even though the case is only a couple of years old , it already inspired no less than FOUR long feature films . Marian Dora's version is the first one I watched , but I sincerely doubt that any of the other three will defeat " Cannibal " when it comes to truthfulness , shocking impact or the explicit depiction of mutilation & manslaughter . This film is indescribably hardcore , with a continuously gritty & devastating atmosphere as well as graphic imagery that will undoubtedly disgust even the toughest and most experienced horror fanatic . Strange and surreal as it may sound , " Cannibal " primarily is an unconventional love-story and a portrait of two men who're social outcasts due to their unacceptable sexual desires . They're not crazed psychopaths or heroine-addicted losers , but introvert gay men with sexual needs only the two of them comprehend . The film soberly opens with Meiwes persona ( though nameless in the film , as well as his victim Bernd Brandes ) carefully looking for male company but always returning home alone again . He then finally meets his ' soul mate ' via the internet and they promptly begin a fairly passionate relationship . Then soon follows the actual reason why the two met each other , namely the killing and ' consumption ' of The Flesh . The victim is castrated at his own request and they both eat the penis before he's killed and eviscerated in extended and horrifying details . If watching " Cannibal " initially feels awkward and uncomfortable , don't immediately think you purchased the wrong movie . It has to be said , the first 40 minutes of the film are . . . um . . . due to the lack of a more fitting term : extremely GAY ! The two protagonists constantly walk around naked , fondle each other and Morian Dora eventually even includes rough footage of homosexual intercourse . Admittedly this is all quite uncomfortable to watch , but it does help a great deal to make the two characters more convincing and at least it provides them with a more likable background , rather then to simply portray them as maniacs . Also very impressive and unforgettable during these first 40 minutes are the uncannily grim photography and especially the chilling musical score . Dora compares the case of the Rohtenburg cannibal with the legendary fairy-tale of Hansel & Gretl , which results in a truly atmospheric into sequence and a handful of brilliant hidden gimmicks , like the sounds of opening doors resembling Hansel cage in the Brothers Grimm's story . Then , when the actual horror starts , " Cannibal " turns into the most stomach-churning movie I ever beheld , and that honestly isn't an exaggeration . The make-up effects are incredibly realistic and deeply disturbing . The already-notorious castration sequence is nearly unwatchable and the dissection of the victim's body near the end of the film goes on uninterrupted for eighteen whole minutes ( make sure you purchase the uncut version ! ) and it's by far the most shocking thing ever captured on film . If you think movies like " Hostel " , " Saw " or that ridiculous " Murder-Set-Pieces " were cruel , " Cannibal " will damage your stomach beyond repair . The acting performances of Carsten Frank and Victor Brandl are excellent , but the English dubbing is a total disaster . Luckily enough , there only are about 15 lines being spoken throughout the entire movie , and they're rather primitive and simply phrases like " I'm your Flesh " or " You're too weak to do it " . All I can say is that this is a extraordinary and unforgettable experience to behold . Very few people will be able to sit the whole film through , but it's an absolute must-see for avid collectors of extreme cinema and warmly recommended to everyone who's sick and tired of goody-goody mainstream horror films .
404533	2020269	454841	9.0	The Hills are Alive with the Sounds of . . . SLAUGHTER ! !	I dislike the nowadays and boisterous remakes of classic horror movies as much as the next person but , ever since the news came that an update of " The Hills Have Eyes " was in talks , I had great expectations towards it . There are reasons for this rather enthusiast anticipation , actually . Unlike " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " or " The Fog " , to name just two examples , Wes Craven's original 1977 screenplay was open for improvement AND Alexandre Aja would be just the right man for the job , as his own project " Haute Tension " is definitely one of the best horror films since the year 2000 . That particular film wasn't really a masterpiece of plotting , but it was genuinely grim and barbaric and those are exactly the qualities a film like " The Hills Have Eyes " require as well . The new screenplay follows Craven's original fairly strict , except that the eyes in the hills aren't of members of an inbred family anymore but of an entire community of horribly mutated ghouls . Deep in the New Mexican deserts , a small village of coal miners once refused to leave the area at the time the American government decided to test nuclear weapons there , and now they still prowl the wasteland , assaulting travelers that dare to leave the main highways . The Carter family is next on the menu , and the mutants really don't care whether the victims are females , elderly folks or even newborn babies . . . Alexandre Aja delivers the exact right amount of disturbing tension and really a lot more gore than you could possibly dream of . Much more than the overrated Eli Roth , this young French filmmaker is the new prodigy of horror . Strictly talking in terms of cinema , " The Hills Have Eyes " is also a more than decent production . The dialogs are fluently written and the characters are a lot more likable than in the original . By them I primarily refer to the members of the Carter family , as Michael Berryman's charisma as creepy Pluto remains unequaled . Altering the background of the desert-people into mutants was a pretty intelligent move by Aja , though . Despite being sadistic and utterly repulsive-looking bastards , these people are basically a sort of " victims " themselves , which brings a lot of extra depth and unsubtle social criticism in the overall simplistic story . I'm sure this film also had its share of flaws , like the editing being a little too MTV-ish perhaps , but the thrills and fast pacing were just too overpowering to have me bother about them . Kudos also to the terrific selection of songs , the convincing cast of actors and actresses and ? last but not least ? the personal trainer of those brilliant German Shepard dogs !
405723	2020269	64888	9.0	Naughty Girls go to Boarding School Hell !	Ever since I beheld a masterpiece called " Quién Puede Matar A Un Niño " ( " Who Can Kill a Child ? " ) , I've been on a constant lookout for THIS Spanish gem that also spawned from the clearly gifted mind of writer / director Narciso Ibáñez-Serrador . Thanks to the help of a good friend , I'm now the proud owner of this film on DVD and I can finally do my share of recommending this genuinely frightening film to other fans . " The House that Screamed " differs a lot from the aforementioned film , but it's a genre highlight all the same . " Who Can Kill A Child " , which got released during the mid-70's , depended a lot on brutal shocks and one truly disturbing theme whereas " The House that Screamed " ( dated 1969 ) teaches us a lesson in pure tension and atmosphere . There's very little on screen bloodshed here , but the film features ? without exaggerating ? a constantly high level of suspense . Literally every sequence bathes in an atmosphere of sheer eeriness and it feels like ominous events lurk behind every corner of every set piece used in the film . As far as I'm concerned , only brilliant directors such as Mario Bava , Dario Argento and Alfred Hitchcock can achieve such a depiction of subtle emotional terror , and now Ibáñez-Serrador is one of the elite . The story is set around the year 1900 , in a Southern French boarding school for girls only . These girls supposedly all have discipline problems and the utterly strict headmistress Mme . Fourneau keeps them on a short leash . She has her hands quite full , as her students continuously plan escapes and she also has to prevent her own teenage son from having contact with the wayward girls . When more and more girls disappear without leaving a single trace , the girls righteously begin to fear that the boarding school also homes a vicious killer . The plot is occasionally slow and predictable , yet you easily forgive all this just because our director puts so much effort & dedication into building up the tension and the drawing of his characters . The climax , albeit implausible , is pretty sensational horror stuff ! The acting performances are FAR above average , with Lilly Palmer in the most memorable role of her career , and the decors are very convincing . This isn't a movie for the nowadays horror audiences ( too little action , I presume ) , but its themes and plot-twists were very ahead of time back in 1969 . If you truly love horror and if you can find a decent copy , I strongly suggest purchasing " The House that Screamed " . Note : This comment is dedicated to fellow IMDb-user G . B , for helping me to obtain this fine movie !
405099	2020269	71507	9.0	If you're into kinky exploitation , go on a date with Flavia !	Flavia the Heretic is an undeniable work of art and probably my number one recommendation to state that the euro-exploitation cinema is severely underrated and not to be ignored . This is an intelligent and complex film , beautifully realized and ? surprise ? pretty damn accurate ! This is more than just meaningless sleaze or gratuitous violence and it's about time those prudish film committees who categorize Flavia as forbidden trash reckon this as well . Flavia is a beautiful 14th century adolescent , forced to live the life of an obedient nun in a strict convent . She refuses to accept her being inferior just because she's female and she curses her fellow sister for being so tolerant about this . After a fruitless attempt to escape , she befriends another rebellious nun and she even guides a troop of bloodthirsty Muslims into the walls of the convent . Flavia is a downright mesmerizing film ! Almost impossible to believe that director Gianfranco Mingozzi managed to make it appear so realistic and so disturbing . I challenge you to come up with a title that centers on the topic of pioneer-feminism more intensely than Flavia does . Several sequences are quite shocking ( on the verge of nightmarish , actually ) as the camera zooms in on brutal rapes , torture and mutilation . Yet all this raw footage isn't just used to satisfy perverted gorehounds , mind you . I'm strongly convinced that they're part of the statement ' Flavia ' is trying to communicate : Humanity ( the Catholic Church in particular ) historically proved itself to be a hypocrite and discriminating race and there's no use in denying it any further . Films like " Flavia , the Heretic " have the courage to question and openly condemn our precious ancestors and I truly admire them for it . Flavia is an outstanding and fundamental exploitation film because of its substance , but it's even brought to an higher level by the wondrous cinematography , the glorious costumes & scenery and a breathtaking musical score by Nicola Piovani . Florinda Bolkin is very convincing as the ambitious and headstrong nun but it's María Casares who steals the show as Sister Agatha . She's a man-hating and loud-mouthed nun who likes to urinate in the open field ! Amen , sister !
405884	2020269	67084	9.0	Impeccable giallo . Well , . . . almost !	Boy oh boy , the early 70's must have been such dangerous times for young & beautiful Italian girls ? At least judging by the amount of giallo-thrillers that were released during this period ! Behind every tree in every park , at every school gate and during every modeling show , there were always black-gloved killers waiting to barbarically kill them , and us , bloodthirsty horror fans , simply can't get enough of it . Duccio Tessari's " The Bloodstained Butterfly " is one of the most incredibly compelling efforts of this wonderful horror sub genre , but it still remains obscure and largely undiscovered by the fans . I have honestly no idea why , because it kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish and it features literally every detail that makes the giallo genre amazing . The plot is one of the most convoluted ones ever , the red herrings are plausible and efficient , the suspense is omnipresent , the acting performances are more than adequate and ? especially ? the use of music is downright perplexing ! Typical giallo-tunes are blend with classic Tchaikovsky music , which is pretty unique in my opinion , but the effect on screen is amazing ! Several more aspects in " The Bloodstained Butterfly " qualify as unique , by the way . The events largely take place in a courtroom , where the famous TV-host Alessandro Marchi is on trial for brutally murdering a young French girl in the park . The poor thing's throat was slit and multiple witnesses claim to have seen Alessandro run away from the scene of the crime . His attorney tries hard to keep Alessandro out of jail ( or so it seems ? ) , but he's eventually found guilty . Shortly after his imprisonment , however , two similar murders occur in the park and the police are forced to start their investigation all over again . The courtroom sequences are very realistic and the plot twists regarding the killer's identity are most likely to have you fooled more than once . So . . . this is a completely impeccable giallo ? Yes , pretty much , apart from a couple of minor flaws . The murders could have been a bit nastier , maybe , and the opening sequences are overlong and quite redundant . Tessari patiently takes his time to introduce ALL the characters in this story , even the supportive ones , and raises false impressions regarding the complexity of the plot . Don't worry when you observe the seemly endless listing of characters near the start , as the plot is perfectly easy to follow .
406492	2020269	51706	9.0	Dr . Boris and Mr . Karloff !	The fabulous BBC couldn't possibly start the new year 2006 better than by showing this little known but surprisingly gripping 50's chiller . " Grip of the Strangler " is excellent ( but scandalously underrated ) with one of Karloff's most impeccable performances and a gloomy Victorian atmosphere . The screenplay is a extra violent variation on the famous " Dr . Jekyll and Mr . Hyde " story , with Boris as a respected novelist investigating a serial-killer case that took place 20 years earlier . According to his research , the person who got executed was actually innocent , and he intend to use the case to make a statement regarding the lousy defense poor people receive when they're on trial . He discovers a LOT more than he bargained for , however , and he as well as his family are about to meet the real Haymarket Strangler . . . This film contains a lot of tension , engaging plot-twists and some very grim moments . The opening sequence , for example , is extremely disturbing as it shows a public hanging where a crowd of socially low classed people are laughing hysterically ( ! ) . The make up effects on the mad-raving killer are genuinely scary and the filming locations really fit the obscure nature of the Victorian era . There are nasty cemeteries , dark police archives and ? above all ? the Judas Hole ; a sleazy nightclub where there's little left to the imagination . Great shocker , definitely one of the best story-driven horror films since Val Lewton's finest productions of the early 40's . A must for all fans of classic horror !
405186	2020269	71318	9.0	Big Brother ; the post-nuclear apocalypse edition .	One of the most successful ( and equally irritating ) TV-formats of recent years is Big Brother , in which a bunch of people , complete strangers to each other , are put together in an isolated location and become forced to get along and accomplish ordeals together . Apparently this concept isn't so new or innovating at all , as the obscure ( although less obscure now , with its recent release on DVD ) and still criminally underrated 70's gem " Chosen Survivors " thrives on a similar premise . Only this movie is at least a gazillion times better than and Big Brother edition you ever saw , because it has genuine suspense , a formidable cast of characters , plot twists you actually don't see coming and ? not to forget ? thousands of bloodthirsty bats ! Now , THAT is what they should do in the TV-series of Big Brother : unleash an army of aggressive and rabid bats on the attention-horny participants , ha ! Ayway , " Chosen Survivors " opens with atmospheric images of the New Mexican desert and army helicopters approaching a secret underground lair . Eleven eminent persons , who achieved great things is different fields ( sports , science , literature , business ? ) awake to hear they are the chosen survivors . On the earth's surface , a nuclear war has wiped out all humanity and they are to remain underground until it is safe again to re-populate the planet . But of course , the survivors don't get along as they should , some them behave overly hostile and suspicious and the hi-tech government designed lair isn't exactly bat-proof . The film offers a splendid combination of terrific character drawing , for psychological tension , and actual nail-bitingly tense situation with the bat attacks and the quest for freedom . H . B . Cross ' script is excellent and Sutton Roley , usually a director of TV series episodes , does an amazing job providing the film with a genuine apocalyptic feeling . The acting performances are top-notch , with notably exceptional roles for Jackie Cooper as the arrogant Mr . Couzins and Bradford Dillman as the calm behavior analyst . Highly recommended Sci-Fi gem .
405988	2020269	74287	10.0	Unhinged giallo masterpiece	Pupi Avati's " La Casa dalle Finestre che ridona " is a one-of-a-kind terror experience and even the most trained horror fanatic will fairly admit that he or she never saw anything like it before . Right from the stylishly cruel opening credits , in which a hoarse male voice talks undetermined yet eerie lines , you just know that you're about to watch a true rarity , even in terms of the already more imaginative Italian giallo films . This is one of the most atmospheric movies ever and the complex , impossible to summarize plotting belongs to the best ones ever . The story introduces Stefano , a young artist who comes to a remote Italian town for renovating an old painting that pictures the slaughter of St . Sebastian . The ghostly town's myth says that the painter , suitably nicknamed " the painter of Agony " inspired his work on real life misery , with dying girls sitting across him as models . When new murders are committed in town , Stefano quickly finds himself trapped in a nightmare of surreal events and unspeakable madness . He discovers that the town carries historical secrets that go far beyond simply one deranged painter . It's true that the story develops itself rather slowly , but just try and be patient because you also right away feel that director Avati is working his way up to something unique . The mystery smoothly unravels itself and the ingenious climax is so excessively original that words fail to describe it . Just see it and be amazed , that's all I can say . I don't understand how some scriptwriters are able to invent such a peerless premise and turn it into such a credible piece of cinema , but I'm graceful for it . The breath-taking atmosphere is reached by simple yet very efficient methods . Some unearthly form of evil is constantly lurking and Avati reaches this sublime effect merely presenting us the ominous little town with its sinister inhabitants . From the midget to the slightly retarded altar-boy ? every person other than our protagonist looks like a dangerous threat . " House with the Laughing Windows " also is guided by an excellently creepy soundtrack , provided by Amedeo Tommasi . His musical score is omnipresent yet not at all intrusive . Every eerie scene is guided by a creepy tune yet the music doesn't get the upper hand so that the events shown constantly repeat themselves in your sub consciousness . This is a brilliant effect and only the most perfect thrillers can promote this . " Casa Delle Finestre che Ridona " is a giallo masterpiece guaranteed to impress you . Watch it preferably Italian spoken with English subtitles so that aspects of minor importance like dubbing don't ruin the mood .
405508	2020269	70917	10.0	Quite possibly the most unique film ever made !	Over a period of less than two days , I saw the Wicker Man three times . The original theatrical version once and the director's cut twice ! Believe all the praising on this one . It really is one of the most stunning films that were ever unleashed upon the world . Unique is the most appropriate word that comes to mind in order to describe it . The Wicker Man is unlike any film you ever saw and an entire chapter of British cinema history to itself . Usually , it takes many parties to create a masterpiece but I dare to say The Wicker Man is largely Anthony Shaffer's accomplishment . His screenplay almost is too brilliant to put into words . The tiniest details and the slightest side-aspects are worked out perfectly . As a viewer , you'll literally feel like you're there ? on Summerisle ! No matter how illogical the plot may sound , the Wicker Man feels disturbingly real and alarming . Simply categorizing it as horror would do injustice to this versatile work of art . The fear and uncomfortable emotions it causes definitely are horror , but in the very first place this is a compelling mystery and a rough religious portrait . Actually , I don't want to give away too many plot aspects . The matter is far too fascinating to spoil and the solid story is so intelligent that a short summary wouldn't bring it any honor . Yes , I have that much respect for this film ! ! Just look at all the devout professionalism and be astonished as well ! Another amazing aspect about The Wicker Man is the tempting soundtrack ? with a slight bit of imagination ; you could actually call it a musical . The music and the film make one terrific wholesome here , and that's a pretty rare achievement . Only in the ancient European exploitation , you can find a similar music-picture relationship . A good cast finishes it all . Edward Woodward shines in the leading role and Christopher Lee portrays the most memorable character in his entire remarkable career as Lord Summerisle . And then there's Britt Ekland as Willow ! Unquestionably the most gorgeous lady in the British horror industry . Frankly , you haven't lived until you see ( and hear ) her sing her Siren's Song ? This film deserves a spot in the IMDb top 250 more than any other motion picture ever did before . Rent , buy or ? if necessary ? steal this movie as soon as possible in case you haven't seen it yet . You can't afford yourself not having seen it .
405727	2020269	139768	10.0	Too Brilliant for Belgian TV !	I can only concur with my fellow reviewers ( and compatriots ! ) and re-establish that " Buiten de Zone " is an absolutely brilliant comedy series and actually way too good according to our country's usual standards ! Anyone who ever saw this show , even if it's only one single episode , knows what nearly dying with laughter truly feels like ! The premise is so incredibly simple and yet every single episode feels totally refreshing and original , even after a million repeated viewing . We have the naturally gifted writers to thank for that , but also the super-enthusiast regular cast as well as loads of guest appearances and cameos . Every actor or actress who means something in Flanders popped up in this show sooner or later and they clearly all loved their little parts . We follow the five volunteers of a helpline center where teenagers can anonymously call to whenever they face typical social problems or questions regarding adulthood . There isn't that much work and thus the main characters constantly flee into a world of fantasies , dreams and absurd hypothetical situations . Every episode features a main theme ( sex , drugs , death , ) on which all the fantasies revolve but there are also running gags that return in every episode , like the negative comments of a family that supposedly watches the show on TV . The brilliance about the humor in " Buiten de Zone " is that the jokes are always genuinely hilarious without getting crude , vulgar or offensive . Even with vulnerable topics , like religion or suicide , the humor is always effective . This is comedy for all generations , even my parents never missed one episode , and it's the most creative formula that ever hit Belgian TV-screens .
