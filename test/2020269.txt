404798	2020269	83661	1.0	Luke , I sacrifice virgins . . .	This is a totally unique movie ! Yes ? UNIQUE ! ! And why ? Because it has the most promising and potentially great sounding plot , about the sacrifice of young female virgins to a hideous sea creature on a remote island community , and yet somehow it manages to be an extremely boring and totally uneventful film ! Is that unique or what ? I watched this movie less than 12 hours ago and I already have a hard time remembering what went on , actually . It has a bunch of uninteresting people , among them James Earl Jones , gathering on this peculiar island to search for a missing girl . She's there all right , but so is a freshly resurrected sea monster the natives are forced to feed virgins to ! After that , I kind of lost track of the plot . Though that doesn't really matter , as nothing happens . The characters talk and talk and talk ? and , occasionally , they throw around cats for some reason . There are no gory death sequences or cool sea monster designs , not even a bit of delightful sleaze . The monster is hardly shown on screen and when it is ( for about 5 seconds ) it looks like the most ugliest sock puppet ever . James Earl Jones ' imposing voice is usually joy to listen to , expect when he exclusively talks nonsense like it is the case here . It must have been weird for those few unlucky people who saw " Blood Tide " at the cinema back in 1982 . The Star Wars movies were hugely popular and Jones ' powerful voice was automatically linked to the image of Darth Vader . Can you imagine Vader to jibber about the cheesy sea creatures , ancient Greek myths and virgin sacrifices ? Do your brain a favor and skip this film . . .
406459	2020269	74434	1.0	Kill ' em all , please . . . Slow and painful !	" What a turkey ! " This is a simple line spoken by one of the characters as he's watching a random movie in the drive-in theater , but the phrase is actually much more applicable to the production he's starring in himself ! This is a truly abysmal low-budget horror flick , put together by a bunch of amateurs that know nothing about cinema but simply wanted to cash-in on the success of such contemporary classics like " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " . Two very UN-heroic police detectives investigate a series of murders that all took place in a Californian drive-in movie theater . It looks like some nutbag is practicing his sword-swashbuckling techniques on the horny customers there . The suspects include the theater's owner ( who used to be a carny ) , the simple-minded janitor and the local pervert that spies upon young couples . Apart from some filthy gore ( the best bits occurring in the opening minutes already ) , there's nothing to see here , unless if you're an admirer of bad acting , bad directing , bad editing , bad photography and even worse music . I couldn't understand half of the dialogs because all the moronic characters were mumbling , and the other half just didn't make any sense . The " red herring " climax is overlong and , despite its short running time , there are still way too many boring moments in the script . The concept and set pieces easily could have resulted in a much better ( pre-slasher ? ) horror movie , if only some talent was involved . Incredibly bad film , avoid like the plague .
406266	2020269	395443	1.0	Dull , derivative , dud . . . Like you ought to know beforehand .	Okay , admittedly I wasn't paying too much attention and there probably is a perfectly logical explanation , but there's something about " Alien Lockdown " that I absolutely don't understand . During the opening sequences there's a dull narration about a meteor crashing on earth millions of years ago and bringing forward an emerald-type of talisman that makes whoever owns it invincible ? or something . Then , all of a sudden , we're back in present time ( or even in the future ? ) and the story revolves on mad scientist building the ultimate soldier in a secret laboratory in the Rocky Mountains . What's the connection with the ancient emerald ? Where does the alien tissue come from ? Most important question of all : who the hell cares ? Naturally , the project goes wrong and a military expedition is sent in to exterminate the monster . Yawn ! " Alien Lockdown " is a frustratingly terrible type of horror / Sci-Fi movie . You honestly wonder why they continue to produce movies like this , as the formula has nothing interesting or original to offer anymore . It's just the umpteenth uninspired and dreadful clone of " Alien " and there's really nothing positive to write about . The characters are walking , talking stereotypes , the scenery and locations look second-hand and the atmosphere is non-existent . And the action sequences , well ? You know what they are like : soldiers endlessly wandering around dark corridors with flashlights , then suddenly there's the flashing image of a hideous monster and the next moment the flashlight lies abandoned on the floor . John Savage terribly overacts as the mad scientist , as if he's protesting against all the worthless crap he's starring in lately . Your glorious days of " The Deer Hunter " and " The Onion Field " are long gone , John ? Michelle Goh acts pretentious and wannabe tough , like she's the first female action heroine ever . She probably doesn't realize they only chose her because Lucy Liu is too expensive . Bah , enough time and words wasted on this dud of a film . Just stay away from it !
404618	2020269	82559	1.0	Destroying zombies and chewing tobacco !	God-awful zombie movie that very well might be the WORST Italian horror production ever , and that's saying a lot with all those numberless " Dawn of the Dead " rip-offs and Lucio Fulci wannabes . This movie is incompetent in every possible aspect . It's so bad that it even comes close to ruining the memory of all the good movies it's inspired on ! The story : a factory , strategically located in the middle of the New Guinean jungle , suffers from a complete meltdown and the poisonous gas that escapes causes the native tribes to transform into walking flesh-eating corpses . Two journalists team up with a S . W . A . T team that is sent to the jungle and together they have to kill a whole lot of zombies before they can reach the factory . Naturally , this zombie romp is extremely gory , with brutal massacres and other types of pure filth every 5 seconds . But the make-up effects are pitiful and evoke more chuckles than feelings of disgust . Inspired by the almighty " Cannibal Holocaust " , director Bruno Mattei ( who's my pick for Italy's worst horror director ) stuffs his film with images and footage of real jungle wildlife , only here it's very misplaced and completely pointless . In all honesty , there is ONE good scene involving a child-zombie that effectively illustrates the infection and the impact of the virus on human beings . The acting is terrible and the script contains a countless amount of stupidities like , for example , a detailed course of how to properly chew tobacco . Avoid , unless you're looking for a good laugh and don't mind wasting 100 minutes of your precious life with it .
406688	2020269	878695	1.0	Surrogate Sense of Shame . . .	A Surrogate sense of shame ? That is the only kind of sentiment " Murder Party " evoked with me . I am literally feeling embarrassed in writer / director Jeremy Saulnier's place for even daring to release such an utterly retarded and infuriatingly dumb excuse for a horror motion picture . What , does really everyone think they are capable of making horror movies nowadays ? This is exactly the type of rubbish to give the entire genre a bad name . For some reason most reviews for " Murder Party " are enthusiast and praising . I figure these critics were either somehow involved in the production or received illicit commissions of some sort , because there's really nothing positive about this movie . At the time of watching , my mate and I were so much under the influence of alcohol and soft-drugs that we even would have found " Not Without My Daughter " hysterical , yet we didn't laugh once at " Murder Party " . Well , with the notable exception of one gag ( the lead character gathering a whole collection of potential weapons only to then just drop them upon seeing his opponents ) but that hardly justifies the price of a purchase . The gags are overlong and often ridiculously over-the-top , the stereotypical characters are insufferable to even gaze at , the gore is really nothing special and each and every tiny aspect about the production is handled incompetently . The lead guy Chris is a big lonesome nerd who finds a personal invitation to a Halloween party on the streets , and since his life is so miserably pathetic , he decides to go and even bring pumpkin bread as a present . He ends up amongst a gathering of the world's biggest lunatics posing as artists and solely invited a random stranger to kill him / her in the name of art . But hey , since they're all crazy , they actually begin killing off each other and forget about the dork in his homemade robot costume . Even with a running time of barely 80 minutes , " Murder Party " outstays its welcome with approximately 75 minutes and it's honestly about time young and ambitious filmmakers realize horror and slapstick aren't supposed to mix , and especially not by clueless amateurs .
404594	2020269	101917	1.0	The Final Embarrassment	Unimaginably stupid , redundant and humiliating closure to the " Nightmare on Elm Street " - series ! Part 6 is so incompetent that it looks like director Rachel Talalay intentionally wanted to turn Wes Craven's initial premise into one big bad and tasteless joke . This isn't just the worst entry in the " Elm Street " saga ; it's also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever made and it downright offends fans of the genre ! The story is dumb , the character drawings are ridiculous , the structure is all murky and ? most of all ? the special and visual effects resemble those of a Tom & Jerry cartoon . The sequences in which Freddy Krueger murders his victims are endless and very uninteresting . Were we supposed to be petrified when a jabbering Freddy turned Breckin Meyer into a video game-character and pogo-sticked him around the walls of a house ? The story takes us back to Springwood and it appears that Freddy all of a sudden has a middle-aged daughter . You'd think he would mention that in one of his previous adventures , but no ? There's only one teenage-survivor in Springwood and Krueger uses him to get into contact with his long lost daughter . Another reason why this final installment is so awful is the completely illogical structure . The John Doe-boy is introduced as the leading character but then all of a sudden he dies and the plot continues to revolve on two adults ! How about that : Freddy Krueger , who spent five entire films killing nothing but teenagers , eventually gets beaten by two adults wearing 3D-glasses ! Sort of like ruins the whole essence , doesn't it ? As far as I'm concerned , " Nightmare on Elm Street " has always been a dreadfully overrated series but , up until now , even the weakest entries had at least some redeeming elements . " Freddy's Dead " , however , is simply unendurable and nobody should waste his / her precious time watching it .
405661	2020269	105643	1.0	: The biggest amount of junk you'll ever see . . . and that's a guarantee ! !	I believe the prestige of Troll 2 has gained much more fame than the movie itself by now . This thing is generally considered as one of the worst movies that ever have been made . For everyone who still thinks that's an exaggerated statement . . . you're wrong ! Troll 2 really IS a disaster every way you look at it and a waste of time , pellicle and effort . Forget everything you knew about the original Troll ( 1986 ) . . . Better yet , forget everything ! ! Forget about the fact you have a bit of intelligence in you and forget about the theory that movies are a form of art and cultural entertainment . . . Those are necessary precautions you have to take in you're planning to sit through this entire movie . By the way . . . if you do make it till the end , you deserve a price . . . chances are that you'll give up a lot sooner . What is it exactly that makes Troll 2 this bad ? ? Well , as a short answer , I'd say everything ! ! The characters make you nauseate and the " actors " who're playing them make you aggressive . The story is pretty pathetic and the setting are completely uninspired . And don't blame the low budget for that ! ! I've seen enough quickies where the level of creativity makes up for the lack of money . The cast and crew here just suffers from a lack of talent ! The special effects and make-up in the original Troll were really dumb and cheesy but they were Oscar-material compared to the stuff used in Troll 2 . There where the original movie did an effort make it look like a hideous creature , Troll 2 just uses childish masks and brown bags . . . really sad . The story ? ? Well , if you insist . . . ( small spoilers . . . who cares ) A family of complete losers decides to spend a couple of months in the countryside . A couple of teenage retards follow them in a caravan . They all arrive in a town where they get turned into vegetables and eaten by " Goblins " . . . Little detail by the way : in the entire movie , the word " Troll " isn't used once ! The constantly ramble about Goblins so the complete background that was given to the Troll in the original movie is wasted in this movie . Either way , the idiotic family receives help from the grandfather who's been dead for a half year and a lot of useless things are being said . That's about it . . . A final word of praise goes out to the very talented cast ! You can be sure about the fact that you'll never see a more unique gathering of wankers ! The mother is extremely irritating , the father is just a big joke , the daughter is pretty good-looking but also pretty stupid . . . and - last but not least - the son Joshua . . . man , I felt the urge to choke that little twat ! Anyway . . . Troll 2 is only recommended to fans of bad ( not to say AWFUL ) cinema . And even then you need to have a strong power of endurance
406440	2020269	235712	1.0	Happy Birthday , Ringu . . . Now beat it !	Even though never a fan of the original to begin with , I once was stupid enough to buy a box set containing all four " Ringu " - films and now I'm stuck with it ! So , like it or not , but here's another negative review on the immensely overrated " Ringu " - series , more particularly about the totally redundant and soporific " Birthday " . Ringu 0 , is it ? Well , that's exactly the rating it can get : . This is a prequel , set approximately 30 years before the murderous videotape events of " Ringu " and revolving entirely on the character of Sadako when she was in her late teens . I have absolutely no idea why , though , because she's an uninteresting and dull person . Several years after her mother's suicide turned Sadako into an emotional wreck , she suddenly decides to join a theater club and become an actress . This all goes well for a while as she seems talented and she even snares herself a boyfriend . It takes approximately ten minutes before boredom similar to the previous two films kicks in and ? even worse ? this installment also suffers from horrible clichés . Sadako turns out the Japanese equivalent of Carrie and her spiritual forces inflict light-bulb implosions and stage machinery falling down by itself . The most embarrassing cliché is kept until the end , when the plot suddenly suggests the existence of an evil-twin sister nobody knows about . Oh please ! Personally , I don't think it's such a great idea to fool your audiences into believing Sadako's spirit represents pure evil during two whole films , only to portray her as a poor and emotionally fragile girl afterwards . Isn't that like ruining the franchise's whole power ? There's no suspense or atmosphere to detect anywhere , acting & directing are mediocre and the few action sequences are way too soft . Forget about " Ringu " and let's watch some REAL horror instead , shall we ?
405681	2020269	295254	2.0	No wonder people claim the horror genre is dead ?	If the survival of horror films depends on titles such as this " FearDotCom " , we are indeed facing the downfall of the genre . This is lame , uninspired and repetitive garbage that irritates you from start to finish . Director William Malone's idea of suspense exists out of underexposed and fuzzy images of murders edited together in boisterous flashes that actually show you NOTHING . Add a poorly written script about a murderous website and completely unconvincing characters to this and you've got yourself one of the biggest cinema-turkeys since the new millennium . If the premise of this film rings a bell , it means that you recognize it from the Japanese cult hit " Ringu " ? . Or the slightly inferior American remake " the Ring " . Only , the videotape has been replaced by an internet website and the poor victims have only 2 days left to live after being exposed instead of 7 . Typical for an unscrupulous rip-off ? Faster , louder and modernized ! The elaboration is a mess : weak dialogue , plot holes all over the place , no style or atmosphere and very bad acting . I can't believe class actors like Udo Kier and Stephen Rea were talked into accepting roles like this ? Surely they can still do better even though they both have seen their best times . Stephen Dorff and the leading lady deliver lousy performances in roles that really don't fit them . Dorff as a tough , experienced copper ? Doubtful ? Perhaps what annoyed me most about the cast ( shallow , I admit ) is seeing how one of my all-time favorite B-actors , Jeffrey Combs , is given such a small and insignificant role ! That's Doctor Herbert West from Re-Animator we're talking about , dammit ! Show a little more respect , Malone ! If you love horror , you should avoid " FearDotCom " at all costs ! It's bad for your nerve system .
405091	2020269	105179	2.0	Beware : Priest at large ! ! !	What's the most frustrating thing that can happen to you in the videostore ? Imagine : you find a box that says ' Prom Night ' with a nice , gruesome cover . You seem to remember that , talking in terms of 80's slashers , this Prom Night is supposed to be a masterpiece . Without hesitating much , you take it and go home . Then you play it and as the credits start to appear on the TV-screen it turns out you've rented something that's actually ' Prom Night 4 : Deliver us from Evil ' . They made a Prom Night 4 now ? ? I've been had ! ! Anyway , since complaining in the videostore is of no use , you just watch this piece of junk . Two young couples , staying in mum and dad's mansion for the weekend , are terrorized by a priest whose thoughts and actions are controlled by the devil . This priest ? father Jones ? killed before , but the Church managed to keep it secret and hidden for 34 years . All this time , Father Jones was locked up in a cellar and tranquillized with drugs . A young , inexperienced priest lets him escape . There's no tension , no background ( how did Father Jones got possessed ? ) and no original deaths . The acting is awful ( or what did you think ? ) and the gore-level is extremely low . Welcome to redundant and stupid sequel n° 5 . 789 ! Oh , one more thing ? it may be a detail but ? where was the Prom ? ?
405693	2020269	100475	2.0	Exorcise All Laughter ?	This is one major disappointing and occasionally even downright insufferable horror-parody . Ironically enough , the funniest aspects about " Repossessed " are the trivia details behind it . Apparently the initial screening tests didn't fail just once , but twice ! At first the script contained almost exclusively jokes and typical situations referring to the 1973 horror landmark " The Exorcist " but , being released no less than 17 years overdue , a large part of the target audience was too young to already have seen that film and hence didn't comprehend the humor . Subsequently , entire parts of the script got replaced with more general and contemporary 80's comedy ( for example : an extended sequence set inside a fitness center with guru Jake Steinfeld ) in order to appeal more to younger viewers , but it still failed because ? well , the movie simply isn't funny ! Writer / director Bob Logan's only remotely praiseworthy accomplishment was that he ( or at least his producers ) managed to trap Linda Blair into playing a mocking version of the one role that made her world famous . But even that you have to put into perspective , as Blair was probably so tired of getting typecast that she considered a comical part her last resort to get rid of her ' that-Exorcist-girl ' reputation . Leslie Nielsen , with his almost naturally comical charisma , narrates the events of " Repossessed " in front of a class of college students . The films opens with a flashback of Nancy's first exorcism in 1973 , but then jumps forward 17 years in time , when she's a married woman with two annoying brat-children . Via the TV-set , the devil takes possession of her body and yet again she spurts gooey green stuff all over her beloved ones . Father Mayii is reluctant to perform another exorcism because of his heart condition , so Nancy relies on the inexperienced young priest Father Brophy and a couple of power-hungry Televangelists that don't even believe in demonic possession . There aren't any truly laugh-out-loud moments in " Repossessed " at all . If you're lucky , you might briefly chuckle once or twice but the majority of jokes are just plain embarrassing . There are numerous lame literal jokes and uninspired puns that'll make you roll your eyes in disbelief . For example , one character says : " The word on the street says that your career is history ? " and at the same moment the camera actually shows a piece of street with the words " your career is history " painted on it . Lame ! The finale is pitiable and seems to go on forever , especially when the entire cast starts imitating the greatest rock stars of the eighties . Remember the intro of " Scary Movie 2 " ( which simultaneously is the only worthwhile sequence in the whole film ) where James Woods does a wacky 10 minutes re-enactment of " The Exorcist " ? Well , it might be crude and vulgar , but that scene is much funnier and more effective as this dud .
405376	2020269	890870	2.0	Play it Again , Saw . . .	These " Saw " sequels reproduce quicker and more merciless than a couple of rats ! With each next visit to your local video store , there's a new " Saw " movie on the shelves and for some reason you feel the need to blindly purchase them although you know it's going to be a bunch of nonsense . This fourth entry in the series should have been titled " The Legacy of Jigsaw " , as John Kramer is undoubtedly dead but his sick and sadistic torture-porn games continue . With each new entry , the character of the Jigsaw Killer also proves to be more intelligent and undefeatable . Here we have a guy with an intellect and general knowledge so immeasurable that he easily could have developed a cure for his own terminal cancer , but instead he wasted his time making the lives of ungrateful people pure hell and subjecting them to complex physical ordeals and puzzles they can't possibly solve . Now he's finally and irreversibly dead ? unless he's strong enough to survive an autopsy ? but the dissection of his corpse results in the discovery of a recorded tape in his intestines . The whole bloody race against time starts over , as the tape reveals that several more people are facing horrible upcoming deaths in Jigsaw's previously prepared traps . SWAT commander Rigg is put to a test challenging his obsession to save people , there appears to be another Jigsaw accomplice at large on the streets ( other than the equally deceased Amanda ) and the script draws a portrait of John Kramer's ex fiancée and the unborn child they lost together . Like all parts in the Saw franchise directed by Darren Lynn Bousman , number four is an incredibly incoherent miscellany of semi-processed ideas and derivative themes . The writers have one major advantage here : the target audiences for this type of film simply crave for loads of blood and sickening set-pieces , so this provides them with extra space to camouflage inexplicable twists and completely screw up logical thinking patterns . The script is full of holes , far-fetched absurdities and plain stupidities . How could Jigsaw punctually predict his new victims ' moves and reactions or even be aware of the sinister facts of police investigators that were charged with the case AFTER his death ? The biggest omission is an acceptable explanation regarding the personality and motivation of Jigsaw's new accomplice , but I suppose this was done to lure the fans to cinemas for Saw 5 , 6 , 7 and God knows how many more sequels . The gore and bloodshed is adequate , I suppose , but it's no longer shocking or involving since none of the characters are likable and / or properly introduced . The nightmarish atmosphere of the original Saw ? written and directed by James Wan ? has entirely vanished and the franchise simply revolves on grotesque yet meaningless human suffering . It's a sad evolution but , admittedly , one that is brought on by the expectancy patterns of nowadays horror fanatics .
405890	2020269	362120	2.0	How do they continue to get worse ?	The concept of the " Scary Movie " - series is beginning to look more like a tragedy instead of a comedy . The first film was a very entertaining hit because it really felt like a silly idea that started as a joke between brothers but unexpectedly turned into a huge success . The second already sucked because it had to be written in a very short time and this showed . Then the third entry in the series promised some improvement , with the change of director to David Zucker , but it was every bit as disappointing . The fourth part simply continues the trend and presents a spitfire of inane gags , dumb characters and completely uninspired satire . The plots of pretty much every successful recent horror and Sci-Fi movie of the past few years are tacky blend together into one giant ridiculous storyline . Cindy Campbell , " heroine " of the previous three films , encounters in one day all the horrors of " Saw " , " The Village " , " War of the Worlds " , " The Grudge " , " Million Dollar Baby " and " The Amityville Horror " . In between , there's even some time left to radically spoof " Brokeback Mountain " and even Tom Cruise's idiotic behavior on the couch at Oprah's show . The humor is crude , vulgar and totally tasteless , yet this doesn't bother me at all . The fact that it's also not at all funny irritates me a lot more . The only couple of modest chuckles are provided by good old regular Leslie Nielsen as the nearly senile President of the United States . It doesn't look like the " Scary Movie " crew plans to stop making sequels any time soon , so we're all doomed to see many more of these inept turds . Now , I know what you're thinking ! " If you're so annoyed by these movies , then simply stop watching them ! " . And you're right , too !
406668	2020269	285531	2.0	Expecting to see a good , solid thriller ? Dream on . . .	You absolutely WON'T hear me say that Stephen King is a bad or untalented author but , come on people , the man is definitely overpraised ! I mean , if he'd write a simple grocery list down on a piece of paper , I bet directors would stand in line begging to make a film out of it . " Dreamcatcher " is a fine example to state this and I sincerely doubt it ever would have reached the theaters if King's name hadn't been attached to it . The story is unoriginal , mediocre , largely incoherent and yet Hollywood immediately had a big budget and eminent names ready to produce a film version . The result is easily one of the worst thriller / horror films of the new Millennium so far . Decades of King experience taught us that his movie-adaptations are the most effective and creepy when they're straightforward and not overly mysterious , like " Carrie " , " Stand By Me " or the downright petrifying " Misery " . " Dreamcatcher " is the exact opposite of this . Scriptwriters William Goldman and Lawrence Kasdan desperately attempt to uphold the mystery elements until the very end and the whole film eventually raises a numerous amount of questions instead of bringing clarity . On top of that , it's ridiculously implausible , badly acted and stuffed with schlocky yet redundant gore scenes . Four thirty-something buddies , " blessed " with bizarre psychic powers since their childhood acquaintance with a peculiar kid called Duddits , come together for a hunting trip in the winter-wonderland of Maine . Their cheerful childhood memories are brutally interrupted when the world is threatened to be destroyed by evil aliens that spawn from people's asses . Yes , you read that right ! It's never really explained what planet they come from ( if any ) or why they opted for this snowy location to invade earth , but they surely seem to hold a grudge against people . The presence of Henry , Jonesy , Beaver and Pete can't be a coincidence and it looks like it's up to their special powers to save humanity , even though the angry army Colonel Curtis ( Morgan Freeman ) circles around the aliens in his helicopter as well . With a runtime of no less than 134 freaking ' minutes , " Dreamcatcher " is at least half an hour too long ! Although the best and most atmospheric parts of the movie , the introduction sequences and flashbacks feature way too many unnecessary details and sentiment . The sudden chance from tacky drama into gruesome Sci-Fi horror is difficult to stomach and the climax ( which is a combination of both ) is rather idiotic . The four main actors ( Thomas Jane , Jason Lee , Timothy Olyphant and Damian Lewis ) try their hardest but fail , whereas the more experienced stars like Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore give away terribly wooden performances , like they're the only ones realizing the whole film entirely sucks . Not the least bit recommended !
406637	2020269	218553	2.0	How do you say " boring " in Japanese ?	Hmmm . . . I really seem to be missing on something here . Practically all my fellow IMDb-users are full of praise for this sequel to Ringu , but I don't second these opinion . It really thought it was a dreadful movie and a very unpleasant cinema experience . How much I'd like to support the Japanese horror-business and encourage people to discover it , I just don't think this is a good representation for it . Personally , I think there's ONE big disease in the film industry : the " easy-money " concept ! Small and simple films become a huge and unexpected success and that encourages the producers to shoot a sequel as soon as possible , in order to make even more money . This disease seems to have contaminated Japan as well now , since I really think Ringu 2 suffers from it . Absolutely NOTHING happens in the first 30 minutes of this film ! ! Than we're served a full quarter of suspense , exciting cinema and good character development . After that , it's downhill again till the end-credits role . A real shame actually , because those short 15 minutes of highlights really proved that there still was a lot of potential to continue the original story of Ringu . The plot involves the mind and will of the little boy from Ringu - Yoichi - taken over by the evil little girl Sadako . To itself , not a bad starting point but poorly executed . You're most likely to read a lot of comments that state Ringu2 is scary and full of suspense . Well , I think some people confuse suspense with complexity . Ringu 2 is nowhere near scary and I think slow and everlasting are more appropriate words . If you're interested in seeing a really scary Japanese movie , I suggest you check out " Audition " by Takashi Miike or even " Dark Water " by the same director who directed this film . Ringu 2 can easily be skipped
404338	2020269	83585	3.0	Let's see how far we can stretch out your neck !	Damn you Sergio Martino and your constant re-using of titles ! Here I was under the impression that I finally tracked down a copy of " Case of the Scorpion's Tail " and then it turns out this is an entirely different movie , actually one that is even more rare but also a whole lot worse . Then I wanted to take comfort in the fact this production stars the almighty B-movie legend John Saxon , but he's only in it during the first EIGHT minutes and then he has his neck wrenched around 180 degrees ! " The Scorpion with two Tails " is undeniably a disappointment , mixing too many story ideas and cult sub genres into one overly confusing film . The plot covers typical giallo-elements as well as supernatural forces of evil and even crime syndicates ! However , none of the story lines are properly elaborated and the whole thing is just intolerably incoherent . Mr . Saxon briefly appears as an American archaeologist who phones his wife to announce he discovered a genuine Etruscan tomb during his research expedition in Italy . He then gets killed and the wife Joan instantly travels to Italy to investigate the circumstances of his death . She learns that her own beloved father runs an international hard drugs network , hallucinates about eerie maggots crawling around everywhere and eventually hooks up with another archaeologist that fancies Etruscan tombs . Every once and a while , a redundant character is killed off by a pair of unidentifiable hands that clearly adore twisting people's necks around ! Sergio Martino is a great director , and Ernesto Gastaldi is an even greater scriptwriter , but " The Scorpion with two Tails " totally lacks all their usual trademarks . It's uninvolving , boring , slow-paced , poorly presented and the murder sequences are tame and entirely gore-free ! The neck-twisting modus operandi is interesting to show once , but not seven times in one film ! The search for the killer's identity ? if he / she is even human ? isn't nearly as compelling as in any of Martino's previous gialli and features no ingenious red herrings . Heck , even the music is lame since it's identical to the score in " Hell of the Living Dead " and that film already stole it from Goblin's soundtrack for " Dawn of the Dead " . Nothing to recommend here , not even to die-hard fans of Italian cinema .
406381	2020269	233142	3.0	In the words of the King : ' Return to Sender ! '	Okay , so the title of my little review might be a bit harsh . 3 . 000 Miles to Graceland isn't that bad and , at times , very imaginative and funny . But , let's face it ? despite of the talented cast and a few original ideas , this productions isn't nearly as decent as it could have been . And it's merely the inexperienced director Demian Lichtenstein who's to blame for this . He's over-enthusiast about his first major film project and inserts way too many experimental , cool-looking camera tricks . Lichtenstein doesn't stick to a certain style and therefore the editing of the finished product looks messy and amateurish . Besides , it's not like his cinematography-playground is very original . Fast moving shots of Las Vegas , using a particular theme during the opening credits , multi angled images of the same casino heist ? All this coolness featured in many flicks before already and often better . It's a real shame Lichtenstein ruined his own movie because the rest of the cast and crew surely proved to be worthy of their money . The script ( even though a bit too long ) contains a pretty solid premise and well-developed characters . Kevin Costner's role is a matter of discussion but personally ; I think he's brilliantly anti-cast . Costner should play psychos more often . And ? never get rid of those sideburns , Kevin !
406471	2020269	83722	3.0	Beauty and the Beast in one ?	I'm writing this review after just having finished watching Cat People and I'm suffering from mixed feelings a bit . . . . I certainly expected it to be better and more valuable than this ? especially because the I heard so much praising on it . Paul Schrader remakes the brilliant 1942 classic with the same title . The original Jacques Tourneur version was terrific because of the simple ? yet very effective ? basic plot story , but Schrader adds so many elements to this that it loses its charm . Also , there were the stress was on the mystery in the original ? Schrader fully goes for the erotic undertones ( like incest , virginity or just plain voyeurism ) . And unfortunately ? the negative elements don't even stop there . As a viewer , you never really have feeling with the main characters in Cat People and the whole film just is too slow ! For a movie that constantly features a black leopard ? it could have used a little more tempo . Still , this film can't be bashed entirely of course , as it still is a stylish and very brutal 80's horror highlight . Nastassja Kinski basically makes every film look good and she's damn sexy here , as the confused beauty torn between incest prepositions ( by Malcolm McDowell ? famous for other cult-hits like Caligula and A Clockwork Orange ) and sincere declarations of love by John Heard ( C . H . U . D ) . Some of the sequences in Cat People are really fascinating and fairly gore ? like for example the thrilling arm-amputation , Kinski's colorful hunting adventure and the descent in Malcolm McDowell's terror dungeon . You can almost smell death in that scene . Unfortunately , the pivot scene are practically copied from the original shot by shot . Like the pool-scene only updated with a little bit of naked Anette O'Toole flesh ? If you're intrigued by the synopsis of Cat People , I strongly recommend to hunt down the original version and most likely the sequel ' Curse of the Cat People ' as well . I haven't seen that one myself , but I can easily imagine it's more than decent . Or , if you want to learn more about Paul Shrader's work in cinema , you'll be better off by renting Mishima , Light Sleeper or even American Gigolo . Cat People doesn't really represent his talent if you ask me .
405696	2020269	159948	3.0	Alice Doesn't Trip Here Anymore	The recent revival of Grindhouse-cinema ( courtesy of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez ) thankfully brought some lost and presumed missing horror and exploitation gems of the late 60's and 70's back in to the spotlights , but inevitably it also helped bringing some awful and righteously forgotten stinkers to the surface . Some brand new DVD-label in my country ? clearly inspired by the success and oddity value of Something Weird Video ? even released this " Alice in Acidland " on disc and promoted it as a true highlight of the rancid exploitation era . Well , it isn't really . This is a terrible film , rapidly shot and edited together to further cash in on the huge success of other ( and better ) contemporary drug-movies like " The Trip " and " Head " and basically the LSD-version of the classic anti-propaganda joke " Reefer Madness " . That particular ' documentary ' ? whether government funded or not ? taught us that Marihuana is responsible for potentially intelligent teenagers to commit adultery , cause hit-and-run accidents , play with guns and even kill themselves . " Alice in Acidland " keeps it all a little sleazier and more easy-going , though . Apparently , all that LSD does is stimulating young and innocent girls to have random sex with strangers ; whether guys that nickname themselves Animal or fellow naughty girls . As you can guess , " Alice in Acidland " is merely just an excuse to show a series of gratuitous soft-porn sequences and delirious color-effects . The set-up is similar to the one of " Reefer Madness " , with a voice-over narration from a psychiatrist and the poor intoxicated Alice herself . That is kind of weird , since the end of the movie clearly states that the LSD messed up poor Alice beyond repair , so how would she be able to narrate her version ? There's absolutely no dialog in the entire film , presumable to save the viewer some really terrible performances , but the ladies are quite luscious and keep the sex footage at least endurable . 55 minutes might seem incredibly short for a long feature film , but believe you me , in the case of " Alice in Acidland " is more than long enough and perhaps even a bit overlong .
405187	2020269	74729	3.0	Mein ( boring ) Kampf	Never thought that I , as a native Dutch speaker , would encounter irremovable Dutch subtitles on a Region 1 movie that came imported from the USA ! This movie is available in the newly released " Grindhouse Experience " box-set , but since it never officially came out on DVD , the version is clearly ripped from an ancient VHS copy . And that copy must have originally come from either The Netherlands or Belgium , which makes sense , as the lowest shelves of video stores around here are literally packed with this sort of rancid exploitation trash ! I've seen loads of " Naziploitation " efforts and they're all pretty terrible , but in the hands of the infamous Bruno Mattei ( appropriately nicknamed the Ed Wood of Italian cinema ) you get something that is even worse than terrible , namely something downright unendurable ! " Naziploitation " was the most pointless trend of 70's smut-cinema and to this day I still fail to comprehend why it was so damn popular in those days . All these movies practically have the same senseless plot , and so does " Women's Camp 119 " . Beautiful and defenseless young girls are shipped off to vile concentration camps where they get abused & humiliated by sleazy wardens and where they serve as reluctant guinea pigs for idiotic scientists of the Third Reich . In this piece of garbage , for example , the girls are forced to thaw frozen Nazi officers using simply their body heat and " cure " men from their wicked disease called homosexuality . One poor woman even has her uterus removed because the Nazi's decided she should share her fertility with other , less fertile women . Of course there's a lot of full-frontal nudity and sex on display , but it's never once arousing or even agreeable to watch . This clearly was an extremely low-budgeted production and I don't even think Bruno Mattei's cinematographers could afford to buy a couple of light bulbs . Too often you find yourself staring at an almost entirely black screen and even the exterior sequences suffer from bad lighting . There are numerous ( and redundant ) scenes in which people glorify the ideals of Hitler and his book " Mein Kampf " , and I suppose this was done simply to increase the shock-value . The acting performances are atrocious , with the exception of Lorraine De Selle who's adequate as the doctor's assistant . In the 1980's , De Selle would also star in Bruno Mattei's absolute best movie called " Woman's Prison Massacre " ; this time as a warden .
405314	2020269	94597	3.0	. . . And Dead FISH Will Rain Down from the Sky !	This odd , incoherent , cheesy and ridicule late-80's horror feature represents the directorial debut of Robert ' Freddy Krueger ' Englund . And let's be honest , if it wouldn't be for his name on the credits , the film would have been righteously forgotten a long time ago already . " 976-Evil " has an absurdly implausible plot and it takes far too long before the ( tepid ) gore & action kicks in . During the first hour of the film only really weird things ? that largely remain unexplained - are going on , like a totally random biblical omen that exists of a shower of fish-rain . Yes , dead fish falling down the sky like normal rain ! I'm not quite sure about the significance , but presumably it's God's sign to warn the lead characters that they will soon face an unholy type of evil . With reason , because rebellious teenager Spike and his nerdy cousin Hoax frequently call the titular phone number to get their daily " horrorscope " . But the toll-free number is possessed with diabolical forces and turns its customers into homicidal monsters . Spike is strong enough to resist , but the miserable Hoax is an easy victim and he soon begins to mutate . He doesn't mind , though , because now he can finally fight back against his domineering mother , the school bullies and all the girls that rejected and laughed at him . You guessed it , " 976-Evil " is just another lowbrow horror version of " Revenge of the Nerds " and the only good thing about it is the choice to cast Stephen Geoffreys . He's ideal to play a character that is simultaneously pathetic and creepy . In the second half of the film , there's a bit of gore and witty one-liners , but it's too late to improve the overall quality . The plot is unimaginably incoherent . Cousin Spike suddenly disappears at one point but randomly appears again for the finale , the amateur-reporter out of the blue hooks up with the school's headmistress and Robert Picardo's potentially terrifying character is never properly introduced . From time to time , you get the impression that Englund is a gifted director but on other occasions you damn him and his film to hell for being just another disappointing and time-wasting 80's turd .
405811	2020269	343449	3.0	Mr . Sandman ? Throw me a BONE !	" The Bone Snatcher " starts out extremely promising , with the introduction of a new and original type of unseen evil as well as with the use of the sublimely isolated filming location of the African desert . Whilst checking pipelines out in the desert , three miners are attacked and killed by a seemingly unworldly creature that devours their flesh and only leaves a pile of half-eaten bones . The expedition crew sent to rescue them discovers that the monster is a superiorly mutated ant-queen , and pretty soon they find themselves trapped in the uncanny desert as well . Director Jason Wulfsohn sustains a respectable level of tension just until the nature of the monster is identified . Immediately after that , the film rapidly turns into an ordinary creature-feature with all the characters dropping out of the survival-race one by one . The second half of " The Bone Snatcher " is unendurably boring ; with the inevitable love-story clichés as well as a complete absence of gory murder set pieces . The characters all are insufferable stereotypes that act and say exactly what you predict several minutes in advance . There's the rookie who has to prove himself , the female with brain-capacity apart from her hot looks , the obnoxious experienced guy who redeems himself at the end through self-sacrifice and ? last but not least ? who could forget the wise black guy who refers to the monster using all kind of voodoo names . Wulfsohn tries too hard to make his monster look like the outer space menaces of " Alien " and " Predator " . The ant-creature has infrared-vision and crumbles when shot at , yawn ! The movie actually just benefits from its unique setting and the handful of nasty images of decomposed bodies . This could have been a modest gem , but instead it's less than mediocre . Avoid .
404454	2020269	109858	3.0	It's embarrassing . . . man	If there's one thing I've learned from reading the other reviews around here , it's definitely that " Funny Man " is the type of film that you either praise into the heavens or hate with a passion ; there doesn't appear to be a middle way . Personally I'm tempted to unite with the hate crew , but that is preeminently because the fan-boys are exaggeratedly enthusiast without using real arguments . They merely just claim that " Funny Man " is awesomely hilarious ; period . I even encountered some reviews where people dreadfully stated that the adversaries of this movie simply " don't get " the type of humor . See , I really hate that ? What exactly is there to " get " ? It's a cheesy and low-budgeted 90's horror movie about an ugly jester killing off uninteresting characters whilst firing off lousy and wannabe clever one-liners , so it's fairly safe to say there's absolutely nothing specific " to get " here . I'll be the first to admit that " Funny Man " also contains a handful of ingenious elements and mildly amusing gags . The main problem , however , are the bad ratios . For every brief flash of inventiveness , there's an intolerably large amount of tedious sequences . For every effective joke , there's literally a truckload of embarrassingly lame and painfully misplaced farces . After approximately 50 minutes of running time , you've pretty much seen and heard about as much as any normal person can take and the last half hour is practically unendurable to sit through . " Funny Man " is probably the most atypical British horror movie I've seen . Traditionally speaking , British genre movies implement a distinct and easy recognizable sense of humor , but this one is as vulgar and insipid as any random amateur US trash production . Most likely more than half of the entire budget was spent on convincing the almighty Christopher Lee to make a cameo appearance among an extended cast of untalented nobodies . Lee briefly pops up at the beginning of the film and portrays a sinister guy in a white suit who gambles his ancestral house in a game of poker and loses it to a sleazy drug-addicted record producer . The joke's on him ? literally ? because Christopher forgot to mention anything about the psychopathic buffoon living there . The Funny Man quickly disposes of the producer's family and eagerly awaits the next shipment of brainless victims to waste . They arrive in the form of a van filled with dimwits looking like runaways from a canceled Scooby-Doo episode . Some of the killing scenes are amusing and imaginatively repellent ( like the duck hunting and puppet theater ) , but the majority of them are plain dull and overlong . The Jester may sound like a potentially cool new horror icon , but he's actually rather uninspired and boring . His appearance seems to be based on Jack Nicholson in " Batman " mixed with a " Killer Klown from Outer Space " , with the stand-up comedian talents of Chucky the Good Guy Doll or maybe even Freddy Kruger in the later installments of " Nightmare on Elm Street " . He has no bizarre background or occult myth attached to him and even the house he operates in doesn't have a morbid history . Well , there we have the problem ? " Funny Man " is a movie without depth . Get that ?
405277	2020269	67382	3.0	Je Ne Comprends Pas . . .	The one-line summary of this review is French , translates itself as " I don't understand " and actually refers to several aspects of this film ? I read several articles where acclaimed critics and fellow directors reward Réné Clément with the title of " the French Hitchcock " . I sincerely hope they didn't base this recognition on seeing " The Deadly Trap " and , if so , I don't understand . I also don't understand half of what's going on this movie and I most certainly don't understand ( or better yet : refuse to accept ) how anyone dares to deliver such a completely incoherent and deceptively pretentious mess of a film ! " The Deadly Trap " revolves on ? believe it or not ? absolutely NOTHING ! At least until very late into the second half of the film , it doesn't . Faye Dunaway and Frank Langella star as a married couple living in Paris with their two children . He behaves increasingly suspicious and secretive regarding his employment ( and I do mean secretive , as we never get told what exactly he does for a living ) and she portrays the good housewife slowly but surely descending in a downwards spiral of paranoia and insanity . Jill continuously fears that the children will become the target of malignant individuals , but Philippe hardly ever listens to a word she's saying . Then , of course , the children do get kidnapped by an organization that wants ' something ' from Philippe in exchange for the children's lives . Even during this crucial point in the movie , we still haven't got a clue what it is they want ( except for ' information ' ) and the supposedly worldwide and dangerous organization imprisons the children in a nearby house with only one female babysitter to guard them . That's just totally retarded . Réné Clément's direction is flat and uninspired and he doesn't even make full use of the wondrously picturesque Parisian filming locations . The original French title means " The House under the Trees " and refers to the organization's hideout , but the beautiful house only features in the film for approximately 2 , 5 minutes . Faye Dunaway , at the top of her ravishing beauty around that time , is the only positive note I can bring myself to write about this unimaginably disappointing movie . She's quite convincing in her role , even though she probably didn't know what it was about , neither .
405951	2020269	82083	3.0	John Saxon makes this a worthy horror viewing	Blood Beach certainly isn't a good film , but it stands for nicely cheap and cheesy horror fun . It's an early 80's horror flick , so you pretty much know what to expect . A plot line that somewhat rips off an earlier made classic horror movie ( in this case : Jaws ) , lots of screaming girls , tension few to none and bad-taste jokes . Blood Beach is about a little seaside town that lives of its tourism . All of a sudden , something evil seems to lurk in the sand ? attacking people and sucking them into the sand , not to be found back . So , like it was the case in ' Jaws ' , the tourists stay away and the local police department is under a lot of pressure to catch whatever horror lives underneath the sand . Blood Beach isn't that gory , actually . Since most victims are just sucked into the sand , no bloody messes overwhelm this film . The good old clichés are present as well , like for example the bizarre and lonely ladyfreak of the town ? Or the return of a long-lost lover ! The music is okay , but a bit too obviously influenced by Jaws and the film has got a very atmospheric open ending . I've got to admit that ! The acting goes from bad to atrocious , but there's one exception ! John Saxon ? this amazingly cool dude stars as the stressed police captain who motivates his men with a great dose of sarcasm and charisma . John Saxon is a great actor and it's always nice to see him show up in little horror fun stuff , like this Blood Beach ! Check it out when you have the chance ! There are worse things to waste your life on , for sure
405266	2020269	90788	3.0	Stick with the Cannibals , Ruggero . . .	Rugero Deodato , not particularly known for his subtle art of film-making ( Cannibal Holocaust , anyone ? ? ) , picks in on the popular 80's trend of slashers ? Quickly produced horror films , preferably without a plot , in which horny and stupid looking teens are slaughtered by the dozen . For the vicious cult-director Deodato this is an excellent opportunity to brings as much repulsiveness to the screen as possible , so he introduces us to over 10 little lambs ready for the slaughter . The ' story ' takes place in the Colorado woods where a group of friends ( well , they're supposed to be friends but all they do is fight and cheat on each other ) go camping and get butchered by a lame killer dressed up like an Indian Shaman . That concludes the highly intelligent plot ? . This film is incredibly ugly to look at . There no tempo , the structure is one major mess and the characters say and do the stupidest things . For example : there's a scene where a girl discovers the mutilated corpse of her boyfriend inside a barn and , instead of running away , she lays herself down on a bed to cry what makes her a very easy new target . Haha ! Like I said , this is an awful film ? and yet it has some cult-value since it was made by Ruggero Deodato and it stars David Hess ( the creep from ' Last House on the Left ' and ' House on the Edge of the Park ' ) , Mimsy Farmer ( ' Four flies on Grey Velvet ' , ' Autopsy ' ? ) and Charles Napier ( ' Supervixens ' ) The cast as well as the multiple violent images make this film worth at least one look . Be advised though ? it's amazingly bad and almost unbearable to sit through .
404906	2020269	95063	3.0	High on ambition . . . low on results	The last thing you expect from a low-budget 80's horror film with the word ' demon ' in its title is complexity and confusion , and yet all you get from " Dream Demon " is complexity and confusion . This British production tries to be more intelligent than the classic it obviously imitates ( Nightmare on Elm Street ) with a very intricate " what's - a - dream - and - what's - reality " - structure . The highly ambitious script ( co-written by director Cokeliss ) intertwines the premarital nightmares of young virgin Diana with the blurry childhood traumas of punk-girl Jenny and , most of the time , you haven't got a clue what's really going on . Diana's dreams , revolving on dark secrets inside the mirrors of her house , connect her to Jenny , who lived there as a kid and returned to Britain to find out who her real parents were . In the meantime , Diana's dreams cause the violent deaths of some persistent journalists that are interested in her upcoming marriage with a local army-hero . Maybe if he had a little more budget ( or talent . . . ) , director Cokeliss might had worked out the interesting ideas more carefully . The story really does have potential and there are obvious moments of ingeniousness , but the wholesome is shaky and unappealing . Too bad , because " Dream Demon " definitely has style ! The atmosphere is often uncanny and the camera-work is very inventive . The acting performances are far above average and the gruesome make-up effects ( although nearly not enough in my opinion ) look very convincing . All in one . . . not recommended .
406663	2020269	70655	4.0	Hey , where has the house gone ? ?	Ah , the house that vanished ? This oddball ( alternate ) title alone was more than enough reason for me to purchase a copy of this obscure and relatively unknown horror flick . But unfortunately , and as the case with too many 70's horror efforts , the title is by far the most exciting aspect about the entire production . This is an unbelievably dull film , stuffed with all the annoying genre-clichés and predictable plot-twist you can possibly think of . During the opening sequences , we follow a young couple ? a photo model and her petty thief lover ? as they break into an isolated house during a foggy night . There they witness a murder and only the girl manages to escape into the woods surrounding the house . And , in case you wonder , the title is really accurate ! When the girl ? Valerie ? wants to show some of her friends where the murder took place , she can't locate the house anymore ! ? Like it vanished into thin air ! Anyway , life goes on and Valerie falls in love with a strangely introvert boy who has a peculiar affair with his aunt and classical music plays whenever he's on screen . The murderer hasn't forgotten about Valerie yet and all kind of sinister happenings lead her back to the murder-house . The plot sounds sensational on paper , and I'm convinced it could have been really great , but the elaboration is very poor and way too slow . The only things to admire during the tedious middle section of the film are main actress Andrea Allan's good looks and her smoking HOT body . Yes , I am aware this is a shallow remark to make , but her spontaneous stripteases truly are the only moments that hold your attention . Director José Ramón Larrez seems to realize this too , since the amount of sleaze and nudity gradually increases as the film reaches towards its climax . There's very little suspense and the few murder scenes are tame and as good as bloodless . The more than obvious denouement is almost like an insult to trained horror fans .
405867	2020269	330691	4.0	New-age giallo without surprises . Where's the blood and gore , Dario ? ? ?	I think even the most fanatic Argento fans will agree that the 90's was a rather disappointing decade for the Italian horror maestro . Both ' Trauma ' and ' The Stendal Syndrome ' were below his normal standards and ' Phantom of the Opera ' was simply bad . But the new millennium seemed to bring back Dario's inspiration and he gave us ' Sleepless ' . I love that film ? the violence is outrageous and the plot is deliciously absurd . ' Sleepless ' was an authentic giallo and it made me anticipate the release of ' The Card Player ' with great expectations ? Well , I regret saying Argento's latest film is yet another minor disappointment . It feels like watching a routine , made-for-TV thriller and the typical Argento touches are nowhere to detect . And worst of all ? it's as good as bloodless ! I couldn't believe my eyes when I noticed when some of the murders were shown in swift , unclear flashes ! Some of them even happened off-screen and that's the last thing I expect in an Italian horror shocker . Dario Argento does move with the times , though ! The screenplay of his latest giallo involves online gaming , web cams , forensic examinations and sell phone text messages . There's a killer on the loose in Rome . He kidnaps girls and offers policewoman Anna Mari the opportunity to save their lives by playing online poker games with him . Since the first victim was a British tourist , Anna teams up with the tough John Brennan who works as a police officer for the British embassy . Granted , during several sequences , Argento manages to create suspense and he still knows how to uphold an unsettling tone . But the plot is far too thin and the twists are predictable . It doesn't require a degree in rocket science to figure out what's going on and even the killer's identity isn't a real mystery . Dario Argento is mostly known as a giallo-director . Gialli form a unique sub-genre because of their complex structure and far-fetched plot-twists . And , not to forget , because of the mad-raving gore sequences and perverted sexual undertones . The Card Player totally lacks all these elements .
405647	2020269	256009	4.0	Very stylish film , but it could have used a little more panache . . .	As much as I'd like to agree with the rest of you cinema-experts around here , I really can't bring myself to call this film a masterpiece and even the genius-reputation of director Guillermo Del Toro is a bit undeserved , if you ask me . His horror movies for large audiences ( " Mimic " , " Hellboy " ) are truly mediocre and even his so-called hidden & personal horror gems ( " Cronos " and this " The Devil's Backbone " ) aren't that impressive , neither . They're both atmospheric and macabre tales with subtlety and charm , but the wholesome eventually turns out empty and rather dull . " The Devil's Backbone " is a beautiful film to look at , but that's pretty much it . The story opens moving and truly emotional ( that's quite logical with a premise set in a orphanage during a devastating war ! ) with identifiable characters and authentic human misery . The Spanish Civil War is largely illustrated through the only partially comprehending eyes of a 10-year-old boy who's dropped in a desert orphanage after the dead of his battling Republican father . Carmen and professor Caseras , the amiable owners of the orphanage , try to take pity on the young Carlos but he continues to face danger even inside the institute . Carlos has to stand up against the obligatory bully-kid , there's the ominous caretaker Jacinto and ? worst of all ? the ongoing rumors about a missing child that still dwells around the orphanage as a restless ghost . The premise is intriguing , almost poetic , and has lots of possibilities . The technical aspects are sublime , with polished special effects instead of gross-out gore , the camera-work is mesmerizing and the acting performances are terrific . And yet , there's something missing which doesn't make this film memorable enough and that's the overly noticeable lack of action . I'm all for atmosphere-driven horror with almost no bloodshed but at least they have to feature a couple of mind-blowing shock sequences . Films like " A Tale of Two Sisters " or " The Others " follow this rule perfectly , but I only counted one pertinent scene in " The Devil's Backbone " ( Carlos ' nightly encounter with Santi ) and the timing ? halfway in the film ? definitely wasn't ideal . The last half hour is unimaginably tedious and totally ruined the promising story idea for me . Films like this only become masterpieces when the story contains several surprising twists or at least ONE perplexing denouement . " The Devil's Backbone " kindly stays within the boundaries of the expected at all times .
405384	2020269	221905	4.0	Did a cruise ship ever dance with a giant octopus by the pale moonlight ?	A really BIG fishy creature , born from spilled toxic nuclear waste during the Cuba-crisis , is consecutively devouring the crew of an American submarine and the passengers of a fancy cruise ship . Well actually , that's just a sub plot as the main storyline involves a super-nervous rookie CIA-agent trying to escort a feared terrorist to the States ALIVE , despite having blown up the American Embassy in Bulgaria and having killed his best friend . There are about seventeen more redundant plots to find in this movie ( the dubious military past of submarine captain Shaw , the " Devil's Eye " research of sexy female oceanologist of Dr . Lisa , the biggest terrorist rescue-mission in the history of mankind , etc etc . . . ) but they're all very irrelevant since all of us just wanted to see a cheesy monster-flick , right ? The good news is that " Octopus " really isn't as awful as everyone else around here claims . The plot is stupid , the lead character is insufferable and the script contains some of the most atrocious dialogues ever written , still there are also campy fun moments to enjoy and the computer-engineered effects are overall tolerable . This mutated squid sure is big , about the same size as the cruise ship and his tentacles are long enough to reach for the sky and pull down helicopters ! It doesn't look the least bit scary or menacing , but personally I expected to see far lousier effects and more pitiful octopus-attacks . The whole thing doesn't make the slightest bit of sense but if you switch off all brain activities , you might still enjoy it .
406392	2020269	67134	4.0	A weaker link in the giallo-team	The brief synopsis of this film promised quite a lot of sadistic murders and and intelligent , convoluted plot twists , but it's actually one of the most boring giallo-efforts I've encountered so far . The plot is uninvolving and introduces too many superfluous characters that like to behave suspiciously even when they have absolutely no reason to ! Take the hero's girlfriend , for example ! She's a blond girl , but occasionally wears a black wig without saying why . Anyways , we're looking for a killer in a world of wild sex parties , blackmailing , astrology and really confused journalists . It all starts with the assault at an Australian doctor on new year's day and many victims follow , although not right away . The killer isn't exactly in a hurry ( he only commits like one murder per month ) and why should he / she be ? There hardly seem to be any police officers investigating the case and the biggest danger comes from an alcoholic journalist with quite a few personal issues . The murders aren't particularly spectacular or imaginative and some of the players couldn't possibly give more careless performances . Like always when his name appears in the credits , Ennio Morricone delivers the best work , with his staggering musical score that provides even the most daft sequences with an undeserved portion of suspense . Franco Nero is truly cool dude , but he obviously feels much more at home wearing his cowboy hat ? preferably that of Django ? an makes a very unconvincing lead star . None of the supportive cast members are really worth mentioning . Trust the general opinion on this one , there are about 50 to 60 Italian gialli that you should give priority over " The Fifth Cord "
405139	2020269	74845	4.0	The . . . Shark Whisperer ? ?	This film proudly opens with the following announcement : " The producers wish to express their sincerest gratitude to the members of the underwater crew who risked their lives to film the shark sequences without the benefit of cages or other protective devices " . Hell yeah they should be grateful ! Especially because , at that point , the cameramen probably didn't yet know anything about how tepid the story lines and how ridiculous the plot of " Mako : The Jaws of Death " actually were ! I'm secretly convinced that these people severely regretted the life-endangering efforts they made once they got to see the finished product . " We risked our lives for this piece of crap ? ! ? " And they would be right , too . Anyways , let's start with a bit of good news first ! Despite the title and the big virulent white teeth parading the VHS-cover , this is NOT a rip-off of Jaws at all . Writer / director William Grefé only eagerly cashed in on the popularity of sharks in horror movies , but he was ambitious enough to come up with an entirely original and personal story-idea , albeit an incredibly silly one . Sonny Stein has a great understanding with sharks and refers to them as his friends . That is to say , he feeds the sharks and protects them against greedy fishermen , and in exchange they don't eat him when he goes for a swim . The kind of relationship Willard had with rats . Through a flashback , Stein explains to a random striptease dancer how an old & anonymous shaman handed him a peculiar amulet , and since then the sharks obey him . Stein is also extremely naive and dumb , as he ' donates ' sharks , supposedly for good causes , to a science lab and to a sleazy ( and mega-fat ) bar-owner for an original entertainment act . When both place abuse the animals , Stein immediately avenges his friends . The script is too implausible & idiotic for words , but everyone involved takes it very serious , like it's the most essentially moralistic nature-versus-humans movie ever made . However , there are one or two good sequences to enjoy , notably the one where the shark-whispering hero kills a poacher and drags him behind his own boat ; his mouth attached to a hook . The budget was generally very low , so don't expect too many special effects . Heck , whenever there's supposed to a shark attack going on , you just see a couple of fuzzy images and water mixed with red paint to raise the impression the sea turned red with blood . The acting performances are downright atrocious to observe . Especially Richard Jaeckel ( " The Amazing Mr . No Legs " , " Grizzly " ) really sucks in the lead . Maybe he subconsciously realized that the screenplay was a bunch of nonsense and his acting talent therefore went on a strike . His character also hasn't got a sense of humor , which is a huge mistake according to me . He doesn't use his shark-friends to score with the ladies , doesn't say anything witty when he hunts down shark killers and he doesn't even make a joke about how astonishingly fat and tasteless the owner of the striptease bar is ! He's just a silent , arrogant and asocial loner who cares too much about sharks . How sad . I'm generously rewarding this film with a rating because I appreciate the effort and because I like sharks but , in all honesty , " Mako : The Jaws of Death " isn't worth any rating higher than two .
405423	2020269	369918	4.0	Hey kid , you got some red on you ?	This movie badly suffers from the M . Night Shyamalan syndrome , meaning that writer Sheldon Wilson desperately tries to be SO mysterious , SO ambitious and SO convoluted that , when the climax eventually approaches and the time has arrived to finally come up with some adequate explanations , the script can't possibly provide any more surprise twists or revelations that are strong enough to live up to the expectations that got built up . " Shallow Ground " isn't too bad , but it tries to be too much . The construction of a nearby dam has finished since a few weeks now , and almost the entire town of Shallow something is preparing to move out and start a new life elsewhere . The local police force as well nearly finished packing up everything in boxes when suddenly a young box walks into the station , entirely covered in blood . The kid won't stop bleeding the blood of at least three different dead persons ; his fingerprints match those of multiple missing persons and he inconspicuously covers the walls with macabre messages like " No One Leaves " . He appears to be a supernatural entity , the hybrid of several restless souls and unsolved murder cases that combined their strength to return from the dead and help the local authorities solving the mystery . Okay , so we've got a fairly original premise , a thoroughly moody atmosphere and literally gallons worth of blood ( though very little on screen massacres ) . Then what went wrong and why isn't " Shallow Ground " ranked among the finest hidden horror gems of recent years ? Well , partly because it was poorly promoted upon its release , but mostly because the film is incoherent as hell and ultimately fails to deliver . Besides , the basic plot outline may sound potentially fascinating but the story loses at lot of its impact very fast . " Shallow Ground " halfway suddenly swifts from being a supernatural mystery to an ordinary serial killer movie , and not exactly a very plausible or original one , I may add . Also , it's never good for a horror film to raise more questions than it can answer . But there are several positive remarks to make as well . " Shallow Ground " is a low-budget film , but it's nicely photographed and benefits from great make-up effects as well as competent acting performances .
405231	2020269	71416	4.0	The Devilish Narrator	Back in college I studied marketing and , even though I missed a whole lot of classes and never really paid any attention , I will always remember the main and most essential principle of marketing , namely : it's not what you sell ; it's HOW you sell it ! This principle fully applies to " The Devil's Triangle " , as it's basically a beautifully wrapped and enticing yet empty package . Writer / director Richard Winer knew exactly that he had to divert the viewer's attention away from the major inaccuracies , so he threw in some elements that never fail when it comes to providing a creepy atmosphere , like the sinister voice of narrator Vincent Price and the oddball music of King Crimson . And I'm guessing Richard Winer's dirty little tricks worked very efficiently , as there was a huge Bermuda Triangle hype going on during the mid-70's and literally every movie production ? whether it was an inaccurate documentary or a sleazy exploitation flick ? covering the topic earned big money at the box office . " The Devil's Triangle " overwhelms you with data that is unstructured and often irrelevant , but the severe dramatization of the facts and of course the intimidating stark voice of the almighty Vincent Price generates an ambiance of fright and creepiness . The narration constantly jumps back and forward in time and covers a massive amount of " strange occurrences " and " mysterious vanishings " of ships and airplanes in the Bermuda Triangle throughout a period of nearly one whole century , but the reports remain extremely vague at all times and the eloquent Mr . Price invariably ends every chapter with the sinister words " ? just another unsolved mystery of the Devil's Triangle ? " . After a couple of cases the whole formula simply becomes laughable and almost pathetic , but I guess it caused genuine mass hysteria back in 1974 . The documentary expands a little more on the most notorious Bermuda Triangle mysteries , like the five planes of military Flight 19 that inexplicably disappeared all at once and the peculiar case of the vessel USS Cyclops , but still even in these chapters only a minimum of serviceable information is given . The cameras never at one point go underwater to explore the depths of the Bermuda area , for example , and the testimonies of the supposedly real-life witnesses of the dramas suspiciously look like staged acting scenes . If you're looking for an informative and objective documentary on the Bermuda Triangle , I certainly wouldn't recommend this movie , but in case you want to sit back and listen to Vincent Price's hypnotizing voice for nearly a full hour , this is your chance !
406270	2020269	125806	4.0	" The Indecent Girls That We Are "	Okay , first and foremost , there's something very wrong with the US-title of this thing . High School ? ? Hitch-Hikers ? ? ? The two leading ladies are way too old to still be in high school and ? even more importantly ? they never at one point during the movie stick up their thumbs to fetch a ride with someone ! The original French title literally translates ( as you could probably guess ) as " Impudent Young Girls " but I presume even that wasn't sleazy enough for the American Grindhouse circuit . That being said , onwards with the actual movie review even though there isn't that much to write . This really feels like an adult movie with the adult bits cut out . Only a porn flick is allowed to have such a flimsy plot because there's the hardcore footage to compensate for it . But , of course , if you leave out the sex you're stuck with a nonsensical wraparound story . And that's exactly what " High School Hitch-Hikers " is : a silly wraparound story with sleaze and a lot of nudity , but no actual fornication . Two traveling and gorgeous young girls , one blond and one brunette , break into a seemingly abandoned mansion to spend the night , unaware it's the hideout place of a jewelery thief and his loot . They meet , have sex and when the girls leave again the next morning the thief notices his stolen jewels are missing . He and his dim-witted accomplices abduct the girls and submit them to " torture " . However , the brunette escapes and turns to a private detective for help . Admittedly the basic plot description doesn't even sound so bad , but the elaboration is truly too inept and hilariously moronic to put into words . Here's a brief listing of my personal favorite aspect that don't make the slightest bit of sense : the kidnappers ' idea of torturing the girls exists of cutting off their hair and ? if that doesn't work ? kidnapper number one ( who looks a lot like Tom Savini ) caresses their bodies and tenderly makes love to them ! Oh , the cruelty ! The mansion supposedly lies in a remote area , yet when the brunette escapes she reaches civilization and even a private detective before the others even notice she's gone . The private detective talks like Inspector Clouseau ( or at least in the dubbed version he does ) and does literally nothing useful . His idea of solving the mystery is to wait in the mansion and have breakfast . During the shootout outside the mansion , none of the four participants get hurt even though they don't bother looking for cover . At one point , one of the accomplices just runs away and doesn't return . Yup , " High School Hitch-Hikers " is an astonishingly bad movie but at the same time quite entertaining from a Grindhouse-experience point of view . The gals are incredibly hot and have exquisite bodies , the typical porn-flick soundtrack is catchy and all the stupidity is oddly relaxing to watch . Personally , I've never been a fan of Jean Rollin's acclaimed and supposedly cult-tastic lesbian vampire flicks , like " Lips of Blood " , " The Living Dead Girl " or " Shiver of the Vampire " . I prefer this movie because it's playful and unpretentious , whereas his usual movies are melancholic and wannabe artistic . At least films like " High School Hitch-Hikers " and the infamous " Zombie Lake " establish what Jean Rollin really is : a smutty Euro-trash director and NOT a visionary and gifted filmmaker .
405788	2020269	82116	4.0	The Notorious B . I . G . strikes again !	I honestly had no idea that the Notorious B . I . G . ( Bert I . Gordon the director ; not the murdered rapper ) was still active in the 80's ! I always presumed the deliciously inept " Empire of the Ants " stood as his last masterful accomplishment in the horror genre , but that was before my dirty little hands stumbled upon an ancient and dusty VHS copy of " The Coming " , a totally obscure and unheard of witchery-movie that actually turned out a more or less pleasant surprise ! What starts out as a seemingly atmospheric tale of late Dark Ages soon takes a silly turn when a villager of year 1692 inexplicably becomes transferred to present day Salum , Massachusetts and promptly attacks a girl in the history museum . For you see , this particular girl is the reincarnation of Ann Putman who was a bona fide evil girl in 1692 and falsely accused over twenty people of practicing witchcraft which led to their executions at the state . The man who attacked Loreen lost his wife and daughter this and wants his overdue revenge . But poor and three centuries older Loreen is just an innocent schoolgirl , ? or is she ? " Burned at the Stake " unfolds like a mixture between " The Exorcist " and " Witchfinder General " with a tad bit of " The Time Machine " thrown in for good measure . Way to go , Bert ! The plot becomes sillier and more senseless with every new twist but at least it never transcends into complete boredom , like too often the case in other contemporary witchcraft movies like " The Dunwich Horror " and " The Devonsville Terror " . The film jumps back and forth between the events in present day and flashbacks of 1692 ; which keeps it rather amusing and fast-paced . The Ann Putman girl is quite a fascinating character , reminiscent of the Abigail Williams character in the more commonly known stage play " The Crucible " ( also depicted by Winona Ryder in the 1996 motion picture ) . There are a couple of cool death sequences , like the teacher in the graveyard or the journalist in the library , that are committed by the ghost of malignant reverend who made a pact with Ann Putman and perhaps even the Devil himself . The film gets pretty spastic and completely absurd near the end , but overall there's some good cheesy fun to be had . Plus , the least you can say about Bert I . Gordon is that he definitely build up some directorial competences over the years .
406285	2020269	83660	5.0	Beware of Murderous has-been 50's Crooner !	Yay ! Another totally obscure early 80's slasher no one has ever heard of ! I often wonder where they keep coming from . Are the 80's still going on in some kind of alternate dimension or something ? How else would you explain the never-ending upstream of long lost slashers ? Anyway , this one isn't very good , but I can honestly state that I've struggled myself through 80's slashers that are much worse and yet somehow enjoy a mild cult reputation . " Blood Song " only enjoys the status of obscurity , but at least it offers a couple of ingenious gimmicks , an occasionally unsettling atmosphere , some nasty killings , a handful of likable characters and ? not to forget ? a unique member in the cast of nobodies ! Ladies and gentlemen : washed up 50's and early 60's crooner Frankie Avalon ! And in all fairness , I also have to admit that the script of " Blood Song " attempts to be slightly more than just a random slasher . The plot tries to spiritually link the female protagonist Marion to a fugitive killer through a blood transfusion , nightmarish POV visions and ? flute music ! " Blood Song " opens with a typically clichéd horror scene , yet with an unexpected twist at the end of it . A young boy witnesses his father killing the unfaithful wife , her lover and himself . What's a poor kid to do at such a traumatizing and future-determining point in life ? Well , play the wooden flute his daddy hand-made for him of course ! More than 20 years later he escapes from a mental asylum , still holding on to his wooden flute , and goes on a rampage where he kills everyone who negatively criticizes the music he produces . Meanwhile , Marion witnesses all of his vile acts in visions because the killer once anonymously donated blood to her when she was involved in a car accident . A confrontation between the two is inevitable , but not before the musical killer eliminates some more random victims first ! Like often the case in this genre , " Blood Song " is a lot more enjoyable if you don't ask too many questions regarding the plot's plausibility and don't bother about the multiple giant holes . All the ingenious aspects of the plot sadly vanish when the girl and the killer first stand face to face and " Blood Song " then reverts to an ordinary stalk-n-slash flick , albeit with an odd father-daughter relationship sub plot . Frankie Avalon isn't too bad , but he hasn't got many lines and what he says doesn't always make much sense . Funny detail is how the script never explains why they sent little Pauly to a mental institution in the first place . Okay , he witnessed a triple murder and suicide but he didn't commit any acts of insanity at young age himself , at least nothing hints in that direction . Since when is it customary to send traumatized kids to an asylum instead of to foster parents or orphanages ? Because now it seems that he only really lost his sanity whilst being committed . A-ah , ( unintentional ? ) food for thought in a mediocre & insignificant 80's horror movie !
404293	2020269	47976	5.0	Remarkable little mind-explosion !	Where to begin with this occult little gem ? To be very honest , I haven't quite figured out what it is yet . Dementia stands as a strange experiment and worth analyzing , that's for sure . I'm probably giving it too much honor now , but I risk to say it's a dared and surrealist highlight of expressionism and no-budget cinema-making ? . BUT , in constant combination with amateurism and wannabe-psychology . You might even say it looks like and Ed Wood film while he had a moment of clarity and ingenious brilliancy . For not more than an hour , we follow around a lonely and seemly anti-social woman in a cruel neighborhood of prostitution , orgies and murder . She suffers from visions of childhood trauma's while she's filling up with fury and hatred towards a rich , ignorant man . She kills him and flees ? chased by the police and haunted by her own morbid imagination . Keeping in mind this film was made in 1953 , it becomes even more interesting ! The US censorship didn't like it at all and the film barely received showings ? No surprises there because , even though the film doesn't contain explicit violence , it's very unpleasant and disturbing to look at . Every character that walks through the screen is unsympathetic and someone you don't want to run into in a dark alley . The atmosphere this film breathes feels like David Lynch's Eraserhead avant-la-lettre , and I wouldn't be surprised if he found some of his inspiration and enthusiasm in Dementia . This film is perhaps a little too weak and messy to refer to as avant-garde , but it does float somewhere between that and cheap B-cinema . Up to you to decide where it's categorized best ! One thing is sure , though ? Dementia is food for thought at film-Academies . I saw the original version of this lost film at a festival , on the big screen and guided by a life-orchestra of cello's and a piano . The film itself doesn't contain any dialogues and therefore this chilling music brought it up to an almost unbearable cult-experience .
406723	2020269	757186	5.0	Stay focused , Dex !	Only the second entry in the " Dexter " TV-show and the concept already slightly begins to weaken . There's less blood & excitement in episode two then there was in the pilot , but also the story lines start to revert to clichéd situations and the characters already start to develop towards typical cop stereotypes . The entire Miami police department is still after the Ice Truck serial killer , but he hasn't made any new moves apart from secretly contacting Dexter and challenging him to a showdown . There are two supplementary ( and seemingly forced ) sub plots in the second episode , namely the murder investigation of an undercover police officer and Dexter himself digging deeper into the trial of a recidivist hit-and-run felon . Completely opposite to the events in the pilot , where the camera deliberately zoomed in on the gory set pieces , the blood & splatter sequences now seem rushed and limited . The dialogs and interactions between the characters become funnier ( " glad to see that sexual harassment seminar paid off " ) but Dexter's narrative thoughts & impressions are still whiny and a little dull to endure . If you speak Spanish , you can probably also predict the future character developments ( like that of Officer Angel Batista ) but I had no idea what he and the lieutenant were saying . James Remar is more clearly visible in this second episode , as Dexter also continues to have extended flashbacks about his adolescence . I hope the next installments will get much better , or at least equal the quality level of the pilot again .
405830	2020269	187738	5.0	Don't Fear The Reaper ( s )	Part two unquestionably is the best entry in the rather dreadful " Blade " series , simply because the director's chair was occupied by a gifted filmmaker for a change . Guillermo Del Toro might be a little overrated ( " Cronos " and " The Devil's Backbone " really aren't that good . . . ) , from a routine and dull vampire movie script , he can make a remotely entertaining and visually impressive time-waster . With Del Toro in charge , it quickly becomes obvious how badly the first " Blade " and " Blade 3 : Trinity " lacked a decent director . The story is also slightly better than in the original Blade , with our half man ? half vampire hero teaming up with his enemies to battle an entirely new breed of bloodsucking species ; the Reapers . These pale and caped monsters are seemly immune to garlic and other old anti-vampire tricks and ? very interesting ? they drink the blood of vampire victims as well as humans . There's still way too much hi-tech nonsense going on in this film and the fights between Blade and his vampire opponents now look like lame imitations of " The Matrix " , but at least there's some relatively good humor in the script and Wesley Snipes is kept on a short leash by Del Toro . Kris Kristofferson reprises his role of cool old mentor but the best part is reserved for Guillermo Del Toro's buddy Ron Perlman . He's the leader of " The Blood Pact " ; a squadron of eccentric vampires that are trained to kill Blade . Perlman is the real star of this movie with his impressive charisma and barbaric looks .
404307	2020269	71200	5.0	Nice formula ? but it ignores the ? horror ' a bit	Amicus was a neat little production company that specialized itself in creating extremely enjoyable omnibus horror films . Especially in the early seventies , they satisfied a large thrill-seeking audience with terror-anthologies like ' Asylum ' , ' The Vault of Horror ' , From Beyond the Grave ' and even the original ' Tales from the Crypt ' Also , you have to admit that they constantly tried to be imaginative and innovating ? and The Beast Must Die is the perfect example to state this . It presents a rather original and new format that involves the viewer . At the beginning and near the end , this film specifically requests the public to join a search . Pretty clever , since this is only a simple method but it does demand the viewer's immediate attention ! The particular search is a werewolf-hunt ! Six persons ? four males and two females ? spend the weekend at a huge ranch . The moon is full , all the necessary scenery is present and at the end of the weekend , the werewolf has to be exposed ! Personally , I rather enjoyed this formula ? it's a nice change and very entertaining nonetheless . Unfortunately , The Beast Must Die lacks a bit of professionalism to be listed among the better horror titles . It's all pretty cheap and especially the make-up and creature effects disappoint . The werewolf isn't the least bit impressive and there are too few shock-sequences to make the film memorable . Actually , aside from the werewolf theme and the presence of horror-regular Cushing , The Beast Must Die has very little to do with horror ! It merely is action / adventure with just a tint of mystery and horror . Regarding the cast , it is veteran Peter Cushing who impresses the most as the specialist-professor in the field of ? Lycanthropes ' . The rest of the cast is rather unknown with the exception of Anton Diffring , here in a delightful little role . If you like classic horror and you're not familiar with Anton Diffring , I advise you to run out to the nearest videostore and rent ' Circus of Horrors ' .
406088	2020269	51381	5.0	Welcome to Mr . BIG's Dollhouse !	Yes , welcome to another cheerfully inept Bert I . Gordon ( B . I . G ) Sci-Fi / horror romp , in which the silliness usually triumphs over adequate scripting and where the special effects look cheaper than half a handful of pennies . " Attack of the Puppet People " is a thoroughly shameless cash-in on the success of " The Incredible Shrinking Man " , but in this light-headed story there's no room for building up claustrophobic atmosphere , let alone the preaching of philosophical messages . It's a fun and charming little movie , but totally lacking depth , credibility and a proper elaboration of the basic premise . John Hoyt stars as a brilliant doll maker slash inventor of shrinking equipment ( rather unusual combination , but okay ) , but he's very lonely and emotionally frustrated since his beloved wife walked out on him once , several years ago . So now , he uses his magic , invisible ray projecting devise to miniaturize the people he risks losing , like his cute secretary Sally and her fiancé Bob . Mr . Franz keeps his little friends asleep in tubes , but also does his best to entertain them with tiny dance parties , the newest Barbie & Ken outfits and even trips to the ' Jekyl & Hyde ' marionette-theater . The ' attack ' referred to in the title is quite inaccurate , as the little folks don't attack anyone ( with the exception of a lifeless Dr . Jekyll marionette ) but they do want to escape and regain their normal previous measurements . " Attack of the Puppet People " is a fairly forgettable and poor film , but it's slightly better and more stylish than most of the things B . I . G accomplished and at least it's never boring . Hoyt is fine as the pitiable & awkward old toymaker , but the supportive cast is too underdeveloped and bleak . If anything , this is an insignificant but pleasant 50's gem with some funny highlights , like the marionette-fight and one of the shrunken gals quacking the cheesy theme song " I'm your living Doll " .
406523	2020269	105569	5.0	Tetsuo is back ! ! . . . . And I'm still not impressed !	Don't really know why everybody hates this movie and calls it so poor compared to the almighty 1988 original . Is it because this sequel is more coherent and easier to understand , maybe ? People tend to refer to a movie as a ' masterpiece ' much quicker when they don't understand one iota of it , of course . As far as I'm concerned , " Tetsuo II " is more or less as powerful ( or as weak , if you wish ) as the original , naturally with some aspects that are worse but also some aspects that are better ! The story is pretty much a reworking of the first , only it's more accessible and ? on a personal matter ? it gave me a lot less headaches ( which I liked ! ) . Once again , the story handles about a man who strangely and disturbingly fuses into a piece of metal equipment , yet now you know more about his background so you can sympathize with him at least a little . His painful transformation is mainly caused by rage ( his son was kidnapped ) and ' medical ' experiments performed by a group of skinheads . " Tetsuo II " contains just as much weirdness and psychedelic imagery as the original , but I admit it all doesn't look so nightmarish here . Partly because it's in color and partly because the characters are given depth , this sequel feels less like a genuine cult gem .
406645	2020269	90655	5.0	Junk . . . but very amusing junk : )	A group of adolescents goes to spend the weekend on a remote island . One by one , they're getting slashed by an unknown killer ? . Yes , everybody is pretty familiar with this plot-synopsis but don't categorize ' April Fool's Day ' in the dull , pointless 80's horror section just yet ! For some unexplainable reason this film is 10 times more bearable than the majority of other Friday the 13th imitations . The atmosphere of this film is very light-headed , it features several ingenious findings and minor plot-twists and there even is a bit of tension to detect in some sequences . Biggest pleasant surprise , however , are the characters in April fool's Day . The routine slasher-picture introduces a bunch of semi-retarded and colorless teenagers and you can't wait for them to die quick and painful ! The protagonists in this film are likable young persons with attitude and character . It's like a small victory to witness this in a horror film . The abrupt climax-twist was okay to me , but it might disappoint hard-boiled horror fans . The film overall isn't that bloody or violent and the focus is merely on the atmosphere and sadist humor . In some ways , it reminded me of Mario Bava's ' Bay of Blood ' and there are worse films to be compared with .
405283	2020269	95742	6.0	Freddy " Big Business " Krueger . . .	Only a small year after " Dream Warriors " got released episode 4 pops up . A small difference in time but a major difference to the image of the series . Freddy is at the top of his popularity in this movie and that's well stressed . The audience wanted to see much more of Freddy and that's what they've got . Freddy looks more like a stand-up comedian than as a horrible killer . He still does the killings of course ( otherwise you don't have a movie , right ) but he can't do it anymore without shooting funny one-liners towards the audience . " How's this for a wet dream , Joey ? " This way , his loses much of his scary image but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie , of course . In fact , it's still my third favorite episode in the series . The original and Dream Warriors are n°1 and 2 and I didn't like New Nightmare at all ( shoot me if you want ) The old formula is respected and a few very original twists are added . Joey , Kincaid and Kirsten ( a transformation from Patricia Arquette into Tuesday Weld ) are the only survivors from the original Elm Street parents who burnt Freddy . Freddy finishes them but of course his urge to kill isn't stopped by that . . . what do you expect , he's a maniac isn't he ? So he needs new victims . Alice is the perfect person to provide this for him . She has the strange gift to bring other people into her dream and that's where they are accessible to Freddy . Lucky for him , Alice entered the dream which killed Kirsten so through Alice he can still his never-ending hunger to kill . . . Patricia Arquette ain't a member of the cast anymore but as the leading actress she gets well replaced by Lisa Wilcox . All the other characters aren't very much worth to be mentioned and they all die , so . . . After Craven himself , Jack Sholder and Chuck Russel , Renny Harlin took a seat in the directors ' chair . Harlin is a rather good director who also made " Prison " . A very scary horror film which I recommend as well . After NOES 4 , he made much bigger budget films like Die Hard 2 , Cliffhangerand Deep Blue Sea . The Dream Master ( the title refers to Alice herself ) is the last " good " nightmare on Elm Street . Episode 5 was just plain stupid and looked more like a bad comic book . Freddy's Dead - The final Nightmare has his moments but overall it sucks and don't get me started about New Nightmare . Killings are original with some great make-up effects , the soundtrack is great , the acting and directing are decent , the script is funny and keeps you focused ( the déjà-vu scene is a great example of this ) and Freddy is uglier than ever . Now , let's all start singing : one-two Freddy is coming for you . . . .
405368	2020269	83959	6.0	Hey there sexy humanoid ? Wanna co-exist ?	Yet another cheap ' n cheesy early 80's " Alien " rip-off produced by Roger " King of the B's " Corman ! This given alone is more than enough reason to proceed with caution and keep your expectations to a minimum . Then , during the opening credits sequence , your first impressions are most likely to seep to an even deeper level , as the first five minutes are a headache-inducing and utterly pointless compilation of confusing and hectic images that make no sense at all . But please do your best to struggle yourself through this crappy opening , because " Forbidden World " does eventually get interesting and worthwhile . Well , in all honesty ? it's crap from start to finish ! But hey , at least it's tremendously entertaining crap ! We're in the darkest regions of outer space , somewhere in a distant future , but there's no menace of aliens this time . The cool-looking monster on the VHS cover is mankind's own little mistake-creation , spawned on a spaceship where the crew was actually trying to discover new types of food sources . Now they're up against a continuously growing monster that somehow understands English , yet dramatically misinterprets the meaning of the verb " co-exist " . Lone space ranger Mike Colby ( Jesse Vint ) is called to the rescue , but he doesn't really contribute anything , except having sex with the female crew members on board . What a guy ! Another scientist member of the expedition eventually comes up with an admittedly creative ( but totally ludicrous ) plan to destroy the monster . Naturally , I can't reveal anything about the denouement , but rest assured it's 100 % original and hilarious . The cinematography is dreadfully dark and unclear , presumably to camouflage the ultra-cheap and tacky set pieces and make-up effects . The monster is very cool , though , and the killings are amusingly gross and bloody . The aforementioned " co-exist " scene truly priceless and any horror fan with a slight sense of humor will LOVE that moment . Alan Holzman didn't have any experience directing movies back in 1982 , but he does a fairly adequate job and admirably prevents his cast from going over the top . Following good old Roger Corman traditions , there's some great sleaze and nudity to enjoy and also the dialogs are imbecilic but fun . Highly recommended in case you can tolerate B-movie cheapness .
404711	2020269	95319	6.0	Delightful Dutch junk	Honneponnetje is a completely meaningless , but very entertaining 80's comedy from the Netherlands . It's a light-hearted waste of time , made with a lot of enthusiasm and goodwill from both cast and crew . The unusual title refers to the star girl's name in the film . She's a sixteen-year-old cutie , stuck behind the walls of a very strict and prudish Catholic boarding school . She manages to get her hands on some erotic literature and she quickly becomes curious and intrigued by the act of lovemaking . So , our little sweetheart independently decides to escape the boarding school and hikes to a nearby city to find out the meaning of ' love ' . The entire comical premise of the film handles about the girl's innocence and naïveté . She doesn't understand the sexist and anti-feminist remarks men make about her looks and she willingly follows anyone who tries to abuse her youthful beauty . She even ends up on the set of a pornographic movie without knowing what's going on ! Meanwhile , mother Superior worries about her institute's good reputation and spreads the word that Honneponnetje has been kidnapped . Like usual in this type of films , there's a forced happy ending and a happy happy joy joy moral attached to it . But , dropping all skepticism , Honneponnetje is good fun and sexy entertainment . Nada Van Nie , whose tender appearance really helps this film's credibility , plays the girl . Other than this film , she only starred ( by my knowledge ) in ' Intensive Care ' . A film that might as well can be referred to as the worst Dutch film ever . The Belgian class actor Herbert Flack has a delightful role as the adult film producer called ' Apollo ' . Funniest scene : The young beauty sees her own breasts for the first time and looks amazed . In the boarding school , she was only allowed to wash herself while wearing a long , white virgin robe .
405573	2020269	83156	6.0	Killing beauty queens . . . Jess Franco Style ! !	Die Säge des Todes - probably best known under the title BLOODY MOON - is Jess Franco's response and share to the popular trend of teen slasher films . This subgenre was merely founded by John Carpenter when he released Halloween and it reached his top in 1980 , when Friday the 13th came out . Jess Franco is , apart from being a very creativy filmmaker , also a pretty good marketeer because he immediately joined this trend and presented us : Die Säge des Todes . True , this movie is far from being the master of exploitation's finest achievement . . . but his fans certainly won't be disappointed and even horror fans and gorehounds in general won't mind watching this film . Franco's style is clearly present in several aspects of the movie . The violence and nudity is shown very explicit and the murder scenes don't leave very much to the imagination . You need to have a pretty strong stomach and nerve-system to keep watching some of these massacres ! ! ( if you're interested in the most brutal decapitation ever shown in films . . . this is your movie ! ! ) . The acting performances are overall better than I feared and you forgive these actresses for their lack of experience . All of them are just so pretty and the scream in such realistic ways . . . I hope the leading actress was payed for each yell she gave , she must be a millionaire then . My highest praise concerning this movie goes out to the great use of atmospheric and creepy music . The theme and the sound effects provide the film with a bit of tension at least . . . The plot is not highly memorable . SMALL SPOILERS It takes place in a Spanish language school which is being led by a middle-aged , fancy looking lady . Well , she leads it but all the money and decisions being made belong to the old aunt of her . Her brother , the horribly mutilated Miguél , just got released from a mental institution and since then . . . terrifying murders are being commited . It's seems fairly obvious that Miguél isn't quite cured yet but is he really the murderer ? ? END SPOILERS Recommended to all kind of horror fans : Those who like exploitation stuff ( especially FRANCO exploitation-stuff ) , fans of violent and bloody slasherfilms and even to the extreme gorehounds . . . Enjoy !
404804	2020269	74342	6.0	A Violent Day at the Races	Just in case you didn't know it yet , Yul Brynner isn't the type of guy you want to mess with ! This charismatic tough bastard starred in a whole lot of western & war movie classics and wasted the lives of approximately a thousand bad guys on screen . Being a big fan of his macho style , I loved to see him star in a typically violent crime-thriller , particularly because this an Italian crime-thriller and those guys always add more of the red stuff and sleaze ! The plot of " Death Rage " is unimportant and routing Mafia & Revenge guff , but the car chase sequences are exhilarating and the wild shootouts are truly blood-soaked ( at least in the uncut version . . . ) . The events are set in Italy ? mainly on the horse racecourse ? where the American hit-man Peter Marciana has come out of retirement especially to kill the gangster boss who was responsible for the death of his beloved brother . Peter gets entangled in the local mafia network , falls in love with a ravishing strip bar dancer ( Barbara Bouchet ! ) and makes a young and spirited thug his hit-man-acolyte . This last sub plot is stolen directly from the Charles Bronson flick " The Mechanic " , but who cares , as every fan knows that Italian cinema loves to borrow ideas from popular American blockbusters . Yul Brynner is still the total definition of coolness , even though he clearly didn't put too much passion into his performance of the ageing assassin . His bald head , his eyes ( that appear to malfunction ) and his sneaky smile are enough to make his character convincing ! Martin Balsam is another veteran actor whose character isn't really important , but it's still very nice to have him around . Antonio Margheriti is ? in my humble opinion ? Italy's most underrated cult director and " Death Rage " is another amiable effort in his repertoire .
406080	2020269	60865	6.0	Flawed but interesting horror / detective thriller .	" Circus of Fear " is a a rare and hard to come across 60's shocker , directed by the same man who made the terrific goth-horror classic " The City of the Dead " . This latter happens to be one of my all time favorite suspense films and even though " Circus of Horror " isn't as unsettling or astonishing , it still definitely is a very good movie with an interesting plot and an original setting . To my regret , however , I also must admit that it's a severely flawed movie , and that's largely because the makers didn't seem to know for sure whether they were shooting a detective-thriller . . . or a horror film . The opening sequences show a group of men robbing a truck transporting bank money and the loot then mysteriously disappears within the scenery of a traveling circus . Scotland Yard inspector Elliot investigates the case and encounters many potential culprits , such as a masked lion tamer ( horror veteran Christopher Lee ) , a blackmailing dwarf and an emotionally frustrated knife-thrower ( quite a danger in his profession ) . Many older Brit-thrillers had extended , well-mounted heist sequences , so the one featuring here isn't very spectacular . The sequences inside the circus are very atmospheric , though , and nearly every character looks threatening and as if they're hiding something . The plot takes quite a few twists near the end and the outcome eventually is unsatisfying . . . or at least it was to me . The cast is excellent with yet another strong performance of Christopher Lee and a curious role for Klaus Kinski as Manfred . If you're familiar with classic horror , you'll recognize the dwarf from other genuine gems like " Vampire Circus " ( Hammer ) , " The Masque of the Red Death " ( Roger Corman ) and " Horror Hospital " . This could have been a much better movie but ? hey - who's complaining ? Definitely worth a watch if you can find it .
404365	2020269	397065	6.0	House of Wackos !	Not nearly as astonishing as André de Toth's original starring the almighty Vincent Price , of course , but this loud and well-made remake of " House of Wax " does qualify as good and ? at times ? chilling entertainment . Note that I'm exclusively talking about the second half of the film , as the first half is a little too obviously stuffed with lousy characterizations ( the rebel-kid , the bimbo who's probably pregnant . . . . ) , terrible clichés ( detours , rednecks in rusty old pick-up trucks , car trouble in a remote town . . . ) and dead-end scares . Six teenagers plan an extended road trip throughout rural America so usually this means that , one by one , they'll be brutally slaughtered by something or someone ! In this case the deranged curators of a seemly abandoned wax museum in the little town of Ambrose . From that point on , " House of Wax " turns into an exciting and tense horror flick with great gimmicks and a couple of authentic shock-moments that will unquestionably make you jump in your seat ! The plot is incredibly silly and grotesque but that's okay since you can't wait to find out in what repulsive ways the lives of these teenagers will abruptly come to an end . And that's where the makers of this film really put their creativity into ! The waxing-process is extremely creepy and the background-story of the museum is cheerfully disturbed ! The town's ' secret ' is a little exaggerated , but still one of the most ingenious twists in post-millennium horror , for sure . The intense finale ? involving ferocious fires and melting statues ? excellently makes the connection with the 1953 original and so even my fear of disrespect towards the classics is uncalled for . I can be brief about the acting , though . . . Elisha Cuthbert is very cute and a popular new icon but I can't really refer to her as a great actress judging by this hysterical role , though . Paris Hilton , however , is outstanding in playing . . . Paris Hilton ! She's just playing a cinema version of herself here : she gives head , has herself videotaped whilst making out and stumbles around for no other reason than to be part of the group . Luckily for us , her character hasn't got too many lines . Jaume Collet-Serra is one of them boisterous music video directors who promoted himself to horror-director , but I have to admit that he does have some eye for atmospheric camera-work and morbid details ! The melting wax statues during the climax are the proof of this . . . Truly uncanny how the smiles remain on their faces ! Recommend in case you're up for some brainless entertainment .
406566	2020269	424136	6.0	Candy , Candy , Candy I can't let you go !	Okay , pedophilia isn't a very pleasant topic but we sadly can't ignore it any longer in these sick times we live in , and personally I think it still took quite a long time before some ambitious nowadays author had the nerves to revolve a whole script on this sensitive and controversial subject . Particularly the first half of " Hard Candy " is deeply impressive , since the characters ? especially Jeff , the pedophile ? are so randomly normal looking , which makes the secret lives they're living all the more disturbing . The opening sequence , displaying an online conversation resulting in a meeting appointment of the two chatters , initially seems so recognizable and harmless until we get to see their faces at the meeting point , and then it's just so . . . wrong ! Hayley is an intellectually precocious 14-year-old girl , apparently lured to the secluded house of a kind and understanding 32-year-old photographer . His intentions are sick and perverted , naturally , and Jeff quickly tries to get Hayley drunk and out of her tiny outfit . Yet , this isn't the start of another tragic story about a physically abused teenager , as suddenly HE gets drugged and tied up in a chair . Hayley selected Jeff off the internet to ruin his entire existence and not vice versa . In her very own private trial against pedophilia , she herself will be the judge , the jury and the executioner and she'll stand up for all the young & innocent victims Jeff ever laid eyes on . As said , the first half of " Hard Candy " is magnificently intense shock-cinema . Hayley's plan is extremely dangerous and against all laws , but her actions are heroic and her speeches are indelible : people like Jeff are sick criminals ! Their actions aren't justifiable and they must all be castrated ! It's highly praiseworthy how director David Slade and writer Brian Nelson don't use this socially fragile topic to raise moral debates or fake sentiment . The opinion towards child molesters are unanimous . They must be punished and referring to their sexual cravings as a disease simply isn't an option ! Unfortunately enough , the script loses quite a lot of its impact after a while . Partly because the cast of two characters is just a little too limited and 45 talkative minutes just passed by without a single moment of action , but mainly because the implausibility takes the upper hand . Exactly how intelligent can a teenage girl be ? How is it possible that she planned every little detail step by step ? How improbable is it that she wins every psychological cat & mouse game ? And ? most of all ? how does a skinny little thing like herself manages to lift a unconscious adult up on a kitchen table ? For thrillers and controversial dramas , it's ultimately the last couple of plot-twists and denouements that are essential . " Hard Candy " sadly does not have the power to haunt your thoughts long after the movie finished . The concept is dared and moving , the photography is often stunning and the acting performances of both Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson are downright staggering , but still I can't label it as a masterpiece .
405771	2020269	420294	6.0	Vietnam is for pussies . . . Visit Texas !	Not being much of a fan of the 2003 remake , I wasn't exactly standing in line to see this prequel to " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " , but what's a horror fan to do when he's wandering around in a videostore and there's nothing else to rent ? But actually I can't complain too much , as this new flick easily surpasses the quality level of the 2003 remake and it honestly is the second best effort in the entire TCM saga , obviously miles behind the one and only original but better than Tobe Hooper's own cheesy 80's sequel and the bizarre spin-off " Leatherface " . I'm not even mentioning the ludicrous " Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre " . For the very first time , a director actually comes close to capturing the gritty and nihilistic atmosphere of the 70's original ! Jonathan Liebesman aims for a relentless low budget ambiance and literally sends the teenage protagonists to hell and back in their encounters with the deranged Texas Hewitt family . Usually in these nowadays popular horror flicks , you can easily point out which teens will die first and which ones will make it out alive , but the lead players in this film are all equally disposable and you really can't tell who , if anyone , will survive ( and what will be left of them ) . If anyone had asked real horror fans ? and particularly the die-hard admirers of Hooper's original landmark ? in advance whether or not it would be a good idea to revolve a prequel on the background of the monstrous family , they surely all would have replied : " No Way ! " . The mystery and void surrounding Leatherface & C° is perhaps the most menacing aspect about this whole franchise . We just know they're a family of butchers and that we certainly don't want to make their acquaintance , out there on the isolated rural roads of Texas . Yet , this whole film and particularly the opening sequences extendedly illustrate Leatherface's early years as well as his " foster " parents ' descent into madness . It's all a bit redundant and overly grotesque , but I feel they could have done much worse . Only after this odd prologue , the actual plot starts with two young couples leaving on their last road trip together , before the boys are reluctantly ( at least , one of them ) sent to Vietnam to fulfill their tour of duty . Following a banal cow-crash , crazed and self-acclaimed Sheriff Hoyt picks them up for a long afternoon of torture games , mental & physical exhaustion and being practice material for deformed Tommy's chainsawing skills . Not much happens during the film's first half , apart from some really dark and eerie images of the Hewitt family estate , but the second half is extremely brutal and full of nasty graphic gore . The chainsaw works overtime and there's plenty of other perverted violence to enjoy , like bondage and sadistic whippings . Really not a film for people with a weak stomach or faint heart , this grisly horror movie is about on par with " Hostel " , " Saw III " and " House of 1000 Corpses " . Another very pleasant surprise for avid fans of grind house 70's horror is that the script features some unexplained but genuinely macabre sub plots ! For example , there's the obese tea lady ( really creepy ! ) and the mutilation of grampa Monty by his own people . Some overlong parts are a bit tedious , however , and there's far too much conversation and monologue in this film . Especially Sheriff Hoyt loses quite a lot of his frightening charisma because he never shuts up . Luckily enough young Leatherface doesn't speak at all . The acting performances are surprisingly decent , with all four the teenage leads being convincing madman bait . And what about poor R . Lee Ermey ? Twenty years after his legendary role in " Full Metal Jacket " , he in a way STILL has to play the mad-shouting army drill instructor . During an interesting sequence in the middle of the film , evil Ermey forces one of his victims to prove himself as a worthy soldier and do 20 push-ups . Talk about typecasting . " TCM : The Beginning " is a competently made and reasonable impressive new horror film with good settings and atmospheric music . It will probably never become a classic like its 70's inspiration , but it makes fun viewing for horror freaks .
406626	2020269	274175	6.0	Evil has two faces ? and one filthy long fingernail !	The last-but-one installment in Hammer's House of Horror saga is a very atmospheric and tense tale , but sadly lacking excitement and memorable horrific moments . It's perhaps the most mysterious episode of them all , since the plot effectively keeps you guessing about what's going on , but the climax is unsatisfying and not answering all the questions that were raised during the build-up . " The Two Faces of Evil " opens with a model family on the road for a well-deserved vacation when the wife suddenly spots a mysteriously uncanny figure dressed in a long yellow raincoat . This same figure is standing at the side of the road in the pouring rain later and they offer him a ride . He promptly attacks the father and the car crashes . The wife and young son wake up unharmed in the hospital , but the father is heavily injured with pieces of glass stuck in his throat . The woman is asked to identify the body of the hitcher ? who supposedly died in the accident ? but he looks identical like her husband , only missing a hand . When they continue their vacation in spite of everything , Janet notices that her husband behaves very strangely and she even starts to wonder if isn't someone else ? The storyline is rather ambitious and atypical for a Hammer production , with subtle creepiness instead of wild shocks and almost no bloodshed at all . In some aspects , the story reminded me of the Sci-Fi classic " Invasion of the Body Snatchers " and there definitely are worse things to get compared with ! Alan Gibson's ( " The Satanic Rites of Dracula " ) direction is masterful and very surefooted , with a detailed eye for the macabre set pieces . Especially the scenes in the hospital's eerie mortuary are gripping . Gibson was also responsible for the absolute greatest episode in the H . H . H series , namely " The Silent Scream " starring Peter Cushing and Brian Cox . This episode's cast doesn't star familiar names , but the performances are really good and convincing .
404610	2020269	106452	6.0	Aliens take control of everything . . . even your body and soul !	Normally , I try never to watch any remakes before I had the chance to see the originals . . . So , watching this movie really was an exception for me since I never saw Don Siegel's version from 1956 and neither did I had the chance so far to catch the Philip Kaufman remake from 1978 starring Donald Sutherland . But this movie came on TV the other night and I watched it anyway . Besides , there were a few very interesting and respected people involved in this production . First of all , there's director Abel Ferrara of course . He already delivered a few true masterpieces before and some of them are personal favorites of mine ( like Driller Killer , Bad Lieutenant and The Addiction ) . But I wasn't completely convinced about watching this movie before I noticed that both Larry Cohen and Stuart Gordon took part in writing the screenplay . All three are very talented and influential men in the field of horror and I figured a collaboration between the three of them could only lead to something good . Well , it certainly is a decent movie and it provides the viewers with several scares . But - in general - I have to admit that I expected a bit more of it . The whole movie looks " unfinished " from time to time and the basic plot-idea isn't explained well enough , I think . I also had the feeling that everything moved too quick . . . Body Snatchers only lasts 87 minutes and that's a bit short for a rather complicated story like this . I would have preferred it to be a little longer and more detailed . Because of the fast storytelling , the ending also looks really fake and too abrupt . That was my biggest disappointment about it , I guess . Nevertheless , Body Snatchers contains multiple memorable scenes and it actually has the ability to raise the hair on your arms . . . That's quite an achievement too , I may say . Especially the sequence where both the daughter ( an adorable Gabrielle Anwar ) and the father ( a terribly boring Terry Kinney ) are being " body-snatched " is really frightening and a beautiful example of suspense-cinema and building up a tight atmosphere . This terrific scene ends with a powerful monologue by Meg Tilly's character . The entire movie is in fact recommended if it were only for this scene ! ! The further cast of Body Snatchers also contains a washed up Beverly Hills star ( whose name I don't remember ) and very enjoyable little roles by first class actors like Forest Whitaker and R . Lee Ermey . I guess this last one is doomed to play the authority figure ever since his outstanding performance in Full Metal Jacket but what the heck . He's brilliant every single time . In conclusion , Body Snatchers contains a few very bloody and explicit sequences so horror fans won't be disappointed completely . It could have been a lot better , that's a fact . But on the other hand . . it could have been a lot worse as well .
404691	2020269	67367	6.0	Horny for Hammer !	With just a few minor changes here and there , " Lust for a Vampire " easily could have been a progressive and even groundbreaking porno-movie ! The title is already a-okay , don't you agree ? Well so are the settings , locations and female casting choices ! The film is largely set in a private school for girls in their late teenage years , and the only conditions of entrance here seem to be luscious behavior and having at least a D-cup . All the male characters are typically weak-minded losers whose actions are exclusively instructed by hormones and even the sensual music emphases the erotic atmosphere . The only thing missing is hardcore sex , in fact . But it's also still somewhat a Gothic Hammer horror movie , loosely based on the works of Sheridan Le Fanu and revolving on the notorious Camilla Karnstein myths . It's the second entry in Hammer's trilogy on the subject matter and unquestionably worse than both " The Vampire Lovers " and " Twins of Evil " . This is possibly due to the cast & crew that worked on the film , though . Every avid horror fan ( or , at least , avid HAMMER fan ) knows that director Jimmy Sangster is not on the same quality level as Terence Fisher , Ralph Bates is no Peter Cushing and Mike Raven is just a pathetic imitator of the almighty Christopher Lee . But still , " Lust of a Vampire " lacks something else . Like a coherent script for example , or Gothic sequences that completely lack suspense . The downright stunningly beautiful Danish actress Yutte Stensgaard stars as Mircalla Herritzen , the indescribably sexy reincarnation of malicious vampire queen Carmilla Karnstein . Simultaneously with her arrival in a little town that lies near a spooky castle , other town girls turn up murdered with suspicious teeth marks in their necks . Tourist and writer Richard LeStrange decides to investigate the events , but he can't resist the gorgeousness of Mircalla's flesh . There are quite a lot of gory moments and ( for their time ) nasty make-up effects , but if you're hoping for genuine frights you better look elsewhere . In case you're already satisfied with some neatly morbid set pieces and a truckload of authentic sleaze , " Lust for a Vampire " is warmly recommended .
406559	2020269	400274	6.0	Grace Anatomy	Released and promoted in some countries as " Cannibal Holocaust 2 : The Beginning " , this really isn't a sequel ( or prequel ) to Ruggero Deodato's legendary exploitation-classic , but more like a shameless and unscrupulous imitation with absolutely no new ideas or innovating concepts to add to the original . The screenplay is almost an exact copy of CH , with a group of power-horny TV people supposedly descending into the Amazon jungle to shoot a documentary about the lives of the last remaining genuine cannibal tribes . The crew , led by the reputedly unrelenting anchorwoman Grace Forsythe , very well knows they'll only get high viewer ratings when they serve their audiences copious amounts of action , bloodshed and repulsive images , and realize their show will be canceled and their careers will be finished if the jungle adventure doesn't turn out to be a success . So when the natives behave a little too tame and peaceful , Grace & C° see it as their own normal duty to burn down villages , kill defenseless villagers , poach innocent animals and rape the local virgins themselves , all for for the sake of sensational TV-making . Also , in good old-fashioned Cannibal Holocaust style , there's one remotely human TV-executive among the bunch who condemns the sick footage and even turns straight to the camera to raise the classic debate " I wonder who the real cannibals are ? " . Needless to say the beastly film crew eventually gets what they deserve , when they encounter the feared community of the Invisibles ; a very primitive and downright savage tribe of which the members clearly aren't interested in a TV-career . It's rather difficult to judge Bruno Mattei's " Cannibal World " . It's a thoroughly unoriginal , repetitive film and it nearly doesn't feature the same raw & shocking atmosphere of its Italian ancestors of the early 80's . Being entirely shot with modern video techniques , " Cannibal World " looks too clean and obviously fake whereas the old cannibal films literally dropped you in the middle of the jungle along with the characters . On the other hand , I can't help feeling more or less obliged to appreciate this film , just because it attempts to bring back the relentless heyday of Italian exploitation cinema ! After all , you got to have some respect for writer / director Bruno Mattei ! The man has passed the age of 70 and yet he's the last of the old guard of Italian horror directors who still has the courage to travel towards the Philipinian jungles and shoot a film with inexperienced actors and limited financial means . That alone deserves the respect of every person who ever showed interest in Italian horror cinema . Moreover , " Cannibal World " is literally stuffed with nasty gimmicks , gory massacres and super-sleazy footage . Fans of explicit disembowelment certainly won't be disappointed , as we extendedly get to see the intestines of nearly every character who walks through the screen . The unknown Helena Wagner is rather terrific as the grade-A bitch Grace and the unearthly beautiful Cindy Jelic Matic provides the slower parts of the film with essential nudity . All together , I personally think us vintage exploitation-fans owe Bruno Mattei a big and sincere " Thank You " .
406330	2020269	56675	7.0	Behind Enemy Lines ? And loving it !	This ultra low-budgeted and virtually unknown war / drama movie is probably the most interesting from an " acting " point-of-view . " War Hunt " remarkably ? but I suppose coincidentally as well ? features the big screen debuts of no less than three names that are nowadays considered hugely famous and acclaimed . Director Sydney Pollack ( who sadly passed away earlier this year ) and charismatic star Tom Skerritt both appear in small yet memorable roles , while Robert Redford ( later star of classics such as " The Sting " and " All The President's Men " ) debuts in the fairly complex leading role of idealistic soldier in the center of a senseless Korean war zone . And yet , in spite of the more appealing great names , it's unquestionably the still underrated veteran actor John Saxon who steals the show . Even more so , Saxon owns the film and he's genuinely petrifying as the introvert soldier who appears to use the Korean War to give rein to his murderous and psychotic tendencies . When the young and inexperienced private Loomis arrives at the front during the last stage of the Korean War , his fellow soldiers immediately warn him to stay out of the way of Private Endore and his protégé Charlie ; a local orphan kid . Endore is a brilliant soldier and of immeasurably value to the American army , but that is mainly because he single-handedly decreases the number of Korean soldiers by deliberately sneaking behind enemy lines at night . Private Loomis protests against this , especially because he wants to protect the young Charlie from his dangerous colleague . The rudimentary plot of " War Hunt " is actually pretty genius , since it's the first and only film ? at least , as far as I know ? that openly suggests signing up for the army is the ideal method for psychopathic killers to get away with their incontrollable urges and even get honored for them ! Private Endore is anti-social , impolite and without manners but his superiors never cease to cover from him because he's such a powerful weapon against the enemy . The atmosphere of " War Hunt " is aptly depressing and dark , with some really brilliant musical choices and bleak photography . Presumably due to the absence of financial means , there's a severe shortage of action scenes and hence you'll have to struggle yourself through a handful of seemingly dull and redundant moments . Still , if it's not necessarily boisterous gunfire and violent battles in the trenches you're searching for , I would definitely recommend " War Hunt " , if it were only for John Saxon's stupendous performance . His menacingly painted faced , the desolate star in his eyes and his completely unpredictable and impulsive personality make this one of the greatest performances I've ever seen in a low-keyed war epic .
404330	2020269	83791	7.0	Who says you're too old to watch fairy-tales ? ?	( SPOILERS coming up ) Like most fans , I fell in love with the Dark Crystal at very young age . I think I was a 6 or 7 years old brat when I saw it for the first time and I was completely astonished . I just stared at it with my eyes and mouth wide open and it was the coolest , most terrific thing I ever saw . I haven't seen it in over 10 long years now and I finally had the opportunity to buy a copy . Yet , I was a bit worried because I feared that the original impact it had on me as a kid would be lost now and the magic it once had would look silly and childish in these modern age of cinema technology . Well , I'm pleased to say that it still was an entertaining and fresh looking fable to me . This kind of tales are not bound to a certain age ? whether you're 9 or 99 years old , you'll always find yourself to be a little enchanted by the Dark Crystal . The sinister fairy-tale world of Dark Crystal exists out of two life forms . Thousands of years ago , the Crystal broke in half ; with one small piece missing and two kinds of creatures ( good and evil ) were created . ? Naturally , the evil breed is the coolest species . They look like a mixture between vultures and wild boars and their days are filled with sucking the juices out of harmless little gnomes and that sort of things . The good breed are a bunch of lame and uninteresting tortoises that only open their mouth and say ' AAAAAAAAAA ' ? A small ? Galfling ' is send out on a quest to find the missing piece of the Crystal and this has to be done before the three suns are lined next to each other . If not , the Evil boys will live and terrorize for all eternity . I think this little summary clearly proves that the Dark Crystal is a highly imaginative film , obviously made with a giant dose of creativity and goodwill . You can enjoy it no matter what age you have . If you watch this together with your little critter , he or she will be intrigued by the wonderful characters that keep on getting introduced . Also , the terrific visuals and unique settings will be loved . If you've reached a more respectable age , Dark Crystal will still be appreciated because of the subtle morbid humor and macabre atmosphere . Yet , I have to be fair and admit that the movie has aged a lot over the years . The film uses quite many conversions between hand-made decors and real environmental footage and that often looks very fake and amateurish . And perhaps , the entire era of CGI has killed the myth of Jim Henson movies ? because of the gigantic technical development in animated movies lately , some children won't be impressed at all and they might laugh it away ? Real shame !
406727	2020269	64727	7.0	Bloodthirstier than Dracula !	" The Bloody Judge " is unquestionably one of Jess Franco's finest accomplishments , and there are several elements that contributed to this . First of all , Christopher Lee depicts another unforgettably mean-spirited and frightening horror protagonist . This doesn't always guarantee a great movie , mind you , as Franco and Lee previously collaborated to make a couple of sequels in the Fu Manchu series , and they were dreadfully boring films . The character of medieval witch hunter Judge Jeffries clearly suits Lee a whole lot better than the oddly mustached oriental master-criminal and his performance confirms this . Secondly , for one of the few times during his entire career , Jess Franco could actually rely on a decent budget ! There was enough money for fancy costumes and atmospheric scenery , and even the editing and cinematography were clearly handled professionally . Finally , you can hardly go wrong with the subject matter of medieval witch-hunting , political corruptness , vile torture footage and robust executions . Although clearly inspired by the popularity of " Witchfinder General " ( starring Vincent Price ) , " The Bloody Judge " contains more than enough own ideas and ingenuity to be considered as a success in its own right . The film opens with the extended and compelling trial of a young girl accused of witchcraft , leading to her relentless execution burning at the stake . The long opening adequately introduces the character of Judge Jeffries , but the actual plot only unfolds after this . The executed girl's sister flees up the country and falls in love with the son of an eminent politician , who also happens to rebel against the corrupt English crown . The obsessive Judge Jeffries orders his followers to capture all the rebels and submit them to torture , but the army of William of Orange is slowly approaching England to conquer the crown . The amounts of graphic violence and ? especially ? gratuitous sleaze are admirably kept rather low , and this in favor of character development and tension building . Naturally , there are a handful of brutal sequences on display ( notably the " interrogation " of poor Alicia ) but " The Bloody Judge " is mainly story & atmosphere-driven . Franco regular Howard Vernon ( Dr . Orloff ! ) has a small but terrific role as the sneering executioner Ketch . Like another reviewer already stated , Vernon here strangely resembles Marty Feldman when he played Igor in " Young Frankenstein " . Maria Rohm is enticing and beautiful as ever playing Mary or " that wench " as people insist on referring to her . " The Bloody Judge " is a good film that easily deserves a spot in my Jess Franco top five , alongside " The Diabolical Dr . Z " , " The Awful Dr . Orloff " , " Faceless " and " Love Letters of a Portuguese Nun " .
406512	2020269	78343	7.0	Go twisted sister , GO !	Why on earth are most comments on this " Killer Nun " so exaggeratedly harsh ? It's certainly true that this film differs immensely from all the other Nunsploitation-movies made previously , with a story that doesn't involve Satan-worshiping nuns for once and a remarkably lesser amount of graphic sex , but that doesn't mean it's inferior exploitation ! On the contrary , I strongly believe the story of " Killer Nun " actually works for a change , since it's loosely based on a factual Belgian serial-killer case about a mentally unstable hospital-convent nurse who turns to murder after imagining an incurable disease . Actress Anita Ekberg , who I think she resembles Kathleen Turner , plays the respected sister Gertrude but she's no longer the devoted nurse / nun she used to be . She's convinced she has cancer , gets addicted to morphine and starts to do ungodly things , like mistreating her patients and even sexually provoking men as well as her young roommate . When some patients are found dead , even Mother Superior begins to doubt sister Gertrude . " Killer Nun " is atmospheric , but often very slow and admittedly the substance might be too scant to fill a whole horror movie with . Peculiar as well is that director Giulio Berruti hints at several controversial topics ( lesbianism , masochism . . . ) but eventually evades to show anything , and this is probably the reason why so many horror fans claim " Killer Nun " is a boring and eventless film . Nevertheless , this rare Italian exploitation gem features a terrific musical score as well as a handful of gory sequences ( that were largely cut in post " video-nasties " versions ) . The acting is far above normal 70's euro-horror standards , with Ekberg , Joe Dallesandro and beauty Paola Morra all in great roles . As far as I'm concerned , this is a good and underrated film !
405264	2020269	100581	7.0	Michele Soavi : Italian horror prodigy !	Soavi's third film credited as a director simply is a unique experience . It's a complex and demanding horror adventure , handling about a young German schoolteacher ( Kelly Curtis ) who becomes dangerously involved with a satanic sect led by veteran-actor Herbert Lom . The screenplay ( co-written by Dario Argento ) often is confusing , but the energy and enthusiasm Soavi puts into the direction simply make this one of the greatest Italian genre efforts ever . The Sect has a terrifically sinister premise and it's brilliantly cinematographed . Soavi clearly has eye for camera-movements and original angles . Even though this film features a rarely seen level of morbidity , you can't just categorize it as horror alone ! In a way , The Sect also is a twisted fairy-tale ( try and detect all the similarities between Miriam's adventure and ' Alice in Wonderland ' ) and a ultra-black comedy ( the sect's most devoted killer looks exactly like Charles Manson ! ) . I'd love to write more about this intriguing film but I'm reluctant to reveal too many spoilers . At any moment in this film , you have no idea what'll happen next . Anything is possible in Michele Soavi land and I'd love for you to check it out yourself ! There are a few deliciously grim sequences and great make-up effects . Highlight of the macabre unquestionably is the face-ripping scene ! And there's another great trivia detail for Italian horror buffs : Giovanni Lombardo Radice has a small role early in the film . The man is clearly aging but he still knows how to gruesomely die in films . Let's talk about Michele Soavi ! ! Unquestionably Dario Argento's most gifted acolyte , but he never really got out of Argento's or Lamberto Bava's shadow . Dario Argento ( Tenebrae , Inferno , Suspiria ? ) took Soavi under his wings because they have the same tastes in film-making and they both share a passion for horror . Very true , but I think you can't deny Soavi is a lot more subtle than his mentor and merely chooses for suspense and atmosphere rather than to rely on graphic gore . The film I saw of him ( The Sect , Dellamorte Dellamore and The Church ) all had a fair share of blood but they're not exactly the gorehound festivals Argento often delivers . I also think Soavi puts more dept and intelligence in his films . Everything he ever was involved in comes with my highest possible recommendation ?
404599	2020269	71439	7.0	Dr . Franco strikes again !	You can say a lot of things about director Jess Franco ( including negative things , mind you ) but most of all , I'd like to think of him as a very clever filmmaker who always damn well knew where there was some easy money to earn ! If there ever was a popular trend or franchise in horror cinema , you can bet your bottom dollar that Jess Franco was part of it or at least attempted to rapidly shoot a film that profited by this particular trend . In the early 80's , when the teen-slasher was immensely popular , Franco brutally hacked up young beauty queens in " Bloody Moon " and in the late 60's already , he also took over the " Fu Manchu " series . Here in this film , our beloved pal Jess further exploits the successful horror character of the evil " Dr . Mabuse " , which was originally created by no less than the German top-director Fritz Lang . " La Venganza del Doctor Mabuse " actually is one of Franco's better films of that period with delightfully twisted characters , stunning locations , truly beautiful camera-work and a terrific musical score . The story is of minor importance but it handles about the mean Dr . Mabuse and his accomplices stealing all kind of attributes from a National Research Institute ( including female staff members ) in order to complete his own , evil mind-control ray . Dr . Mabuse has this impressive and horribly scarred man-monster that kills for him while the entire police force desperately tries to catch him . This film is great and trashy entertainment , starring some incredibly beautiful cult-sirens like Ava Garden , Ewa Strömberg and Beni Cardoso . . . all wearing mini-skirts ! The action sequences are a little grotesque , but Franco's directing is very stylish and surefooted . Many of Franco's later films suffer from overlong and tedious scenes but this effort is pure excitement from start to finish . Typical Franco trademarks also include that he makes references towards his earlier films ( more particularly , " the Awful Dr . Orloff " ) and that he rewards himself with a small supportive role . Definitely one of the director's best films and simultaneously a great title to illustrate the class of early 70's euro-exploitation !
406372	2020269	106449	7.0	Horror Anthology for Insiders	Movie-buffs ( and perhaps horror fanatics in particular ) are strange and unpredictable beings , aren't they ? Most of the time we're extremely skeptical and criticize ambitious new projects , yet sometimes we're easily pleased and highly enthusiast about something that is completely derivative , mundane and unoriginal . " Body Bags " is the perfect example to illustrate that : it's a horror omnibus existing of three incredibly prototypic segments and a repetitive type of wraparound story , yet I personally enjoyed it immensely . This is a good old-fashioned " sit back , relax and switch off all brain functions " type of anthology with a nice diversity in suspense , comedy , splatter and absurdity . Yet , the undeniable strongpoint of " Body Bags " is the all-star horror cast and crew , with legendary actors and even directors of the genre appearing in fun supportive roles and insignificant cameos . No less than John Carpenter directs two out of three stories and even stars as the host in the wraparound story . Clearly inspired by " Tales from the Crypt " , Carpenter plays the witty and morbid morgue employee exactly like the infamous Crypt Keeper ; though with still a little more flesh around the bones ( though not too much ) . The first story was the most effective one ! Regardless of how clichéd , repetitive and predictable " The Gas Station " is , it's a genuine horror entertainment . With the landmark " Halloween " , Carpenter obviously proved he's the undeniable master of stalk-and-slash movies , and " The Gas Station " ideally fits the pattern . During her first night working in a remote gas station , Anne receives a visit from the maniacal killer who's been terrorizing the area since weeks . It's a highly segment with cool red herrings , dumb decisions , some good gore and a neatly uncanny atmosphere . The remaining two stories are slightly less overpowering , mainly because they revolve on sillier topics . " Hair " introduces an aging playboy who cannot accept his hairline becoming thinner . He desperately starts seeking for a hair-growing method that works and finds the incredibly treatment of the slightly odd Dr . Lock . Needless to say Richard's new hairdo begins to lead its own life with terrible consequences . " Hair " is obviously the most blackly comical chapter of the three . This story isn't gory or tense , but it's a very likable satire about vanity . Finally , " Eye " centers on a successful and happily married athlete who loses his eye in a tragic car accident . He spontaneously volunteers for a brand new and risky eye-transplant procedure and slowly begins to carry on with his life . Shortly after , he begins to suffer from horrific visions and learns the eye's previous owner was a sadistic serial killer . " Eye " starts off a little slow and dull , but gradually turns into an exciting and gruesome little shock-story . With a bit of imagination , you could even interpret this segment as some sort of predecessor for the more famous Asian ghost story " The Eye " . Admittedly none of the stories are extraordinary brilliant or innovating , but they're definitely traditional and enthusiastically made . And , as said already , if you don't care about the actual stories , you can always yourself entertain by playing " spot-the-horror-star " . " Body Bags " boosts an amazing cast including John Carpenter ( " Halloween " ) , Tobe Hooper ( " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " ) , Sam Raimi ( " The Evil Dead " ) , Roger Corman ( " Pit and the Pendulum " ) , Wes Craven ( " Nightmare on Elm Street " ) , Robert Carradine ( " Orca " ) , David Naughton ( " American Werewolf in London " ) , George Buck Flower ( " The Fog " ) , Stacy Keach ( " Mountain of the Cannibal God " ) , David Warner ( " The Omen " ) , Mark Hamill ( " Star Wars " ) , Twiggy ( " The Doctor and the Devils " ) , Deborah Harry ( " Videodrome " ) and Charles Napier ( " Supervixens " ) .
406636	2020269	71276	7.0	Captain Cool ! ! !	CAPTAIN KRONOS : VAMPIRE HUNTER ? . Be honest , isn't this one of the most powerful and macho sounding film titles you've ever heard ? Well , I think it is and it gives an extra status to this great film . Kronos certainly is one of the best Hammer productions and they accomplished this even without casting Peter Cushing or Christopher Lee . It's a very intriguing story that can rely on great settings , lovely costumes and a light-headed atmosphere . And above all , it's very original . Captain Kronos fools around a bit with the traditional vampire-characteristics and by doing so ; it adds a lot of values to these mythical creatures . Kronos states , for example , that vampires aren't exclusively after the blood of people , they might as well just suck the youth and beauty out of their victims . This little difference in plot is enough to create a complete and fascinating movie . Add a few very original and surprisingly good little elements to this ( like the frog-theory ) and you've got yourself 90 minutes of pure fun . Horst Janson portrays the captain . He's a strong and rather goofy looking German but the role fits him real well . He rides with Prof . Hieronymos Grost ( some sort of variant to Doctor Van Helsing with a hump ) and on their way , they free the extremely good looking Caroline Munro ( her character was sentenced for dancing on a Sunday ? which gives you and idea of the religious theme in this film ) . The image of Miss Munro might ring several bells in the heads of horror and cult freaks . She has done quite a lot horror films ( Maniac , Slaughter High , Dracula A . D ) and worked together with great , legendary directors such as Jess Franco ( Faceless ) . Captain Kronos has everything in the right proportions : some nice and gruesome make-up effects , lovely action sequences , a tad bit of humor and very good screenplay . And I do believe it was a rather influential film . The recent box-office hit Blade certainly found some of its inspiration here . Recommended !
406082	2020269	106308	7.0	Bruce Campbell kicks medieval butt in the last part of this GREAT franchise .	Well , one thing you can't possibly say about Sam Raimi's " Evil Dead " trilogy would be that it's dull or repetitive ! The series went from hardcore horror ( " The Evil Dead " ) to splatter comedy ( " Evil Dead 2 " ) and this final entry is almost pure slapstick with only an occasional flash of gore . Bruce Campbell , who evolved incredibly as an actor , reprises his role of chainsaw-swinging hero Ash who's now catapulted back in time to somewhere early in the medieval era . In order to get back to his supermarket job in the 20th century , he has to join and train a castle community in their battle against evil . Ash's very own clone leads the evil troops and they largely exist out of walking ' n talking skeletons . " Army of Darkness " is a very funny and light-headed film that ignores the horror in favor of funny gimmicks and cheerful swashbuckling . That's not necessarily a bad thing but it's understandable that most people rate it as the least good part of the series . Bruce Campbell , however , is terrific and this definitely is the role that defined him as the ultimate horror icon of the last two decades . Some of his quotes are already considered classic by now ( " Hail to the King , Baby " , " Shop smart . Shop S-Mart " ) and most fans are still secretly hoping for a third sequel . The " March of the Dead " - theme by Danny Elfman is splendid and Sam Raimi's direction is as professional as ever . Unlike the previous Evil Dead installments , " Army of Darkness " may not be a genre milestone but it sure remains great fun to watch it over and over again .
406560	2020269	82744	7.0	Look Ma , I caught us some jailbait !	Thoroughly unoriginal , primitive and nasty , yet compelling and strangely unsettling , " Midnight " truly is the masterwork of novelist John A . Russo . The co-writer of the legendary horror classic " Night of the Living Dead " always somewhat stood in the shadow of George A . Romero , but " Midnight " is his very own and personalized venture into the depths of grisly backwoods-horror and uncanny rednecks . Russo clearly didn't have much of a budget to work with , yet he manages to create a gripping atmosphere through eerily isolated locations , appalling characters and moody music . And even though you've endured the routine story - centering on a family of demented social outcasts terrorizing travelers - at least a dozen times before , Russo's screenplay still manages to deliver a handful of efficient frights and shocking moments . The great ( late ) Lawrence Tierney stars as an aggressive drunken pervert , and yet his character is one of the good guys , since the others are inbred Satanists , hoodlum teenagers and unfriendly hillbillies . When Bert Johnson once again attempts to rape his under-aged stepdaughter , the girl flees and hitchhikes her way down South . She fetches a ride in the van of two young boys , who rob grocery stores for fun , and together they end up in a little town where none of the inhabitants have any of their original teeth left . Deeply hidden in the woods surrounding this town , there lives a crazed family of devil-worshipers who're collecting female virgins to sacrifice to our Lord Satan on Easter Sunday . Why ? Because their late mother taught them to do this , of course ! " Midnight " is derivative of " Psycho " , " Texas Chainsaw Massacre " , " Deliverance " and a truckload of other grindhouse 70's flicks . So much even that it feels like you're watching a genuine 70's drive-in feature ! Despite released during the early 80's , " Midnight " features the soundtrack , photography and narrative style of a typically trashy 70's horror cinema . John Russo implements a raw and brutal filming style , with disturbing images of country folks and graphic violence . Tom Savini ( old friends with Russo and Romero ) was in charge of the make-up effects , so you just know there will be some deliciously succulent massacres on display . In one particularly nasty scene , the camera zooms in on one of the depraved hicks slicing a young girl's throat with a rusty saw . How can any fan of horror cinema resist that ? By no means " Midnight " will ever be considered a classic , but it's tremendous fun none the less .
405818	2020269	75290	7.0	Real human misery meets Mexican exploitation	Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic " Alive " , there already was the legendary Mexican exploitation director René Cardona who used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film " Supervivientes de los Andes " . The unforgettable fatal flight of Fairchild 571 that crashed in the Argentinian Andes on October 13 , 1972 . This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers , most of them members of a professional rugby team . But 16 people of them were eventually rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate fellow-passengers . Of course you can't claim that this cheaply made and roughly edited film is better than the famous 90's version but I definitely appreciate and respect this film more . After all , an exploitation film demands a lot more input from both cast and crew while the big-budgeted Marshall film , although intense , feels more like routine money-making . The sets and special effects naturally can't compete with " Alive " , but " Supervivientes . . . " delivers an equally impressive sentiment of hopelessness and creates an even more nightmarish hell of snow . Cardona's film is ambitious , surprisingly compelling and easily one of the most remarkable Mexican productions ever . I am really astonished that Cardona's take on this story isn't more exploitative and explicit . The scenes where the deceased passengers are cut open and consumed are nevertheless hard to digest , but they only serve to increase the credibility of the catastrophe and to stress the inhuman conditions of the survivors . Rather praiseworthy for a vicious director who gained fame with his notoriously bad films like " Night of the Bloody Apes " and the Santo-series . The unknown young Mexican actors do a great job and the musical score is endearing . The story is well-known , of course , so the screenplay doesn't offer any unexpected shocks . Either by history or previously having seen " Alive " , you know which kind of dramas these people still have to endure before being rescued and you can only await them . Still , this is a good film that shouldn't be bashed like too often is the case .
405627	2020269	105690	7.0	Bad Guys Galore !	I remember , mostly back when it got released but even still now , dull critics and sour people in general simply categorized " Under Siege " as a lousy and uninspired version of " Die Hard " on a battleship instead of atop a skyscraper . Okay , this may very well be the most apt description imaginable , but that doesn't mean this movie can't awesome popcorn entertainment ! I usually restrain from writing about anything that isn't horror or cult cinema , but I gladly make exceptions for action flicks if they A ) are extremely violent and / or B ) feature highly memorable villainous characters . These two factors happen to be very well-presented in " Under Siege " . There's an enormous body count throughout the entire movie and the bad guys ? well ? they are simply what makes this film so darn enjoyable . I've never really been a fan of Steven Seagal and agree that if his role were to be played by Bruce Willis or perhaps even Sylvester Stallone the film could even be better , but it doesn't really matter all that much thanks to Colm Meaney , Gary Busey and Tommy Lee Jones . Particularly Busey as the treacherous and psychopathic commander and Jones as dangerously demented former special agent are so terrific that you'll often even forget Seagal wanders around the ship somewhere as well . A lot of mariners are gathered on the USS Missouri to attend a Pearl Harbour memorial but mostly to participate in the captain's birthday party afterwards . The ideal opportunity for greedy Cmdr . Krill ( Busey ) and a troop of mercenaries led by William Stranix to hijack the battleship and toy around with its huge arsenal of nuclear weaponry . One thing they didn't take into account , however , is the presence of the Captain's personal friend and acclaimed chef Casey Ryback . Ryback never really liked Krill ? maybe because the latter spat in his bouillabaisse ? ? and with his secret Navy SEAL past , the terrorists are up against an opponent much tougher than they bargained for . Exactly like it was the case in the aforementioned " Die Hard " , " Under Siege " benefits mostly from its claustrophobic and nearly inescapable setting . Director Andrew Davis admirably makes great use of the ship's dark interiors and ominous mechanical chambers by having his characters stroll around endlessly with their guns ready to fire away . This is definitely Steven Seagal's best film and it would have even been better if his character was a deaf-mute , or something ! His corny one-liners are terrible , but luckily he's often accompanied by the ravishing Baywatch babe Erika Eleniak ( who also treats us to a totally gratuitous but oh-so-welcome boobs shot ) or one of the baddies . Actually , I can't even be sure if this is Seagal's best film as I still haven't seen the majority of his not-so-impressive repertoire . I sincerely doubt , however , that straight-to-video productions like " Belly of the Beast " and " Urban Justice " can be any better than this modest action hit of the glorious early 90's .
404959	2020269	75375	7.0	Unorthodox-Copper Holocaust !	You just know you're in for one hell of a thrill-ride when the movie you're watching opens with a 10-minutes-long chase sequence on motorcycles ; through the crowd-infested streets of Rome and ending with a shocking execution that truly goes against all the rules of ethically correct police work . " Live like a Cop , Die Like a Man " is a work of genuine 70's exploitation , scripted by the multi-talented Fernando Di Leo and directed by the almighty Ruggero Deodato . Deodato is , without a doubt and hands down , the KING of exploitation cinema ! A couple of years before he dedicated himself to the notorious jungle adventures ( " Jungle Holocaust " , " Cut and Run " and , of course , his ultimate masterpiece " Cannibal Holocaust " ) and brutal revenge-horror ( " House on the Edge of the Park " ) , Deodato made his one and only " Polizieschi " movie , but it's definitely memorable & unique enough to rank among the best in the sub genre . " Live Like a Cop , Die Like a Man " is an indescribably sadistic and cynical film and it's very different from the usual efforts in the " Polizieschi " genre . These raw and explicit Italian crime-thrillers always introduce macho cop characters that shoot first and ask questions later , but at least they usually have good reasons for their very unorthodox investigation techniques . They either want to avenge a murdered friend or colleague , or they're on a tight time-schedule to rescue kidnapped children or recover a stolen treasure . ( Al ) Fred ( o ) and ( An ) Tony ( o ) , the two protagonists in Deodato's film , are different . They simply cross the thin line between justice and delinquency because they enjoy it ! Much more than any other entry in the Polizieschi sub genre , " Live Like a Cop , Die like a Man " glorifies extreme violence and nearly encourages people to take justice into their own hands . Fred and Tony terminate unarmed & defenseless gangsters , force female suspects into having sex with them , burn down fancy cars and invade private clubs for no real reason and they carelessly endanger the lives of civilians . And whilst they're performing their " jobs " , they never for one second stop to pay attention to their good playboy-looks and macho charisma . This film is fast-paced and multiple isolated sequences are terrific ( the hostage-situation ! The bank robbery ! ) , but the script as a whole sadly lacks continuity and depth . There's no actual plot , as Fred & Tony are simply hunting down Rome's biggest crime boss , Roberto Pasquini , and they eliminate a lot of his accomplices and random street scum during their ' assignment ' . Most other Polizieschi flicks have a slightly more intelligent script , but " Live Like a Cop , Die Like a Man " primarily benefices from sickening violence , gratuitous sleaze and unscrupulous controversy . The editing is sharp , the lurid 70's music is fabulous and Deodato's profound direction is brilliant and ultimately praiseworthy . I read somewhere that the motorcycle chases amidst crowded shopping streets and during broad daylight were filmed without official permission . Your name simply has to be Ruggero Deodato if you risk endangering the lives of unsuspecting civilians only to shoot credible and realistic footage of Rome !
406325	2020269	83557	8.0	A Paranoid Android's Gotta Do What a Paranoid Android's Gotta do !	The least you can say about Aaron Lipstadt's " Android " is that it is a bit of a maverick and rarity in the universe of early 80's cinema . In an era when people automatically associated the Science-Fiction genre with either hideous invincible creatures ( " Alien " ) or adventurous fantasy ( the " Star Wars " - trilogy ) , this movie actually attempts to make a character-study / drama using exclusively Sci-Fi characters . " Android " feels like a successful mixture between the themes of " Saturn 3 " and even the embittered atmosphere the almighty classic " Blade Runner " . That is highly ambitious and praiseworthy , especially since the credits list Roger Corman's name as an executive producer and during that time he was mostly infamous for his excessively violent and exploitative rip-offs . The always amazing Klaus Kinski gives a perplexing performance as a mysterious scientist , illegally constructing androids in a space-station far far away . Dr . Daniel is continuously preoccupied with his work whilst his android assistant Max 404 plays videogames and secretly craves to learn more about being a human . The arrival of three fugitive criminals drastically alters their existence . One of them is namely a woman , and both Dr . Daniel and Max are enchanted by her appearance albeit for totally different reasons . The good doctor finally sees an opportunity to research the possibility of a female android and Max discovers emotions he didn't even know existed . It gets worse when Max learns he's disposable and rebels against superior . " Android " benefits most from its witty and inventively written script . The film is most impressive when relying on substance and acting performances , as the special effects and decors appear miserably cheap and tacky . The " surprise " ending is efficient and unpredictably without being overly far-fetched . Kinski is , as said , genius is his familiar role of eccentric and slightly offbeat scientist , but Don Opper ( who also co-wrote the film ) is at least equally astounding as Max 404 . Not only does he look uncanny and artificial , but his grimaces and movements are truly spot-on ! Extra admirable is that neither Don Opper nor director Aaron Lipstadt had any cinematic experience before they worked on " Android " together . This may be an anonymous and underrated movie , but to me it's one of the most remarkable films of the 80's . Highly recommended .
406732	2020269	166924	8.0	Incomprehensible elegance	Mulholland Dr . must be located somewhere on the ' lost highway ' in the wide area of ' Twin Peaks ' ? in other words ; it's a pure David Lynch product and a film that will unquestionably divide audiences . Every time this genius ( to some , at least ) delivers a film , it immediately grows out the biggest cinematic event of the year and a topic of endless discussions . Seeing the rating on this site , it looks like many people consider this Lynch's best achievement in the weirdness field ( The Elephant Man and The Straight Story not included ) , yet I don't agree with that . No doubt it's a mesmerizing film that haunts and moves you long after you finished watching it , though . On the surface , this is a tale handling about the stereotypical life in Hollywood . You've got the young and easily impressed actress who's hoping to build up a career ( Noami Watts ) and there also is a second storyline handling about a director ( Justin Theroux ) influenced and threatened by the mob in his casting choices . So basically , this is film-noir type of story but it's crystal clear that Lynch doesn't care much for the typical genre intrigues and focuses more on what's lying underneath ? like the whole spectrum of human emotions . Oh heck , I can't explain it and neither can anyone else . But it works ! Throughout the whole film , you're hypnotized by the elegance and mystery Mulholland Dr . radiates . The bizarre and eccentric characters fascinate you and the slow-paced camera-work creates an unmatched tension that'll make you jump more than once . And yet , something is lacking here . Although Lynch can't be blamed for it , as he intended this a pilot film for a new TV-series in Twin Peaks style . HUGE SPOILER after an hour and a half of careful observing and hunting for clues , the story falls into identities switching . This sort of leaves you behind with the unsatisfied feeling of déjà-vu as you recognize it from Lynch previous classic ' Lost Highway ' . END SPOILER . After ABC declined turning this into a TV-series it feels like Lynch rushed with adding twists and turns with a disappointing climax as a result . Despite these flaws , Mulholland Dr . still ranks as one of the greatest films since the new millennium with its unique eeriness and excellent cast . Naomi Watts is terrific as the tender and fragile young actress and Laura Harring is downright breathtaking . There's a near-perfect chemistry between the two leading ladies resulting in the most sensual erotic sequences of the last few decades . There also are minuscule supportive roles for class actors like Dan Hedaya and Robert Forster .
404257	2020269	65555	8.0	Charlie & Telly in a gritty ' n great urban western !	There's absolutely no way that any movie can start off better than " Violent City " . Charlie Bronson on a yacht with a ravishing blond chick , then moving onto land where the couple immediately gets subjected to a wild car chase through extremely narrow streets ( and over stairs ! ) and ending with a violent shootout ! And all this time not a single word is being spoken by anyone and all we here are the sounds of squeaking tires , snorting car engines and Ennio Moricone's umpteenth fabulous soundtrack . The first ten minutes of " Violent City " are so damn brilliant I was even tempted to stop watching the film because I honestly feared things could only go downwards from that point , ha ! Luckily it didn't . Sure the pacing slowed down a bit ( only a little bit , mind you ) but a great film unfolds itself , with a simplistic but nevertheless compelling plot , gritty atmosphere and terrific acting performances by Charles Bronson ( as the silent as always but deadly killer ) , Telly Savalas ( as the sneering , sleazy and eccentric super-villain ) and Jill Ireland ( as the bimbo who appears to screw around with half of the city ) . Jeff is a retiring hit man who completes one more personal killing job when a former friend double-crosses him , leaves him for dead and runs off with his lady friend . Jeff's spectacular payback , executed at a race car circuit ) gets him noticed by the big boss of the city's organized crime network . He wants Jeff to be a part of his successful crime-family , and when he refuses an exhilarating and testosterone-packed cat and mouse game ensues . The plot isn't highly original , but several independent sequences are magnificent , like the aforementioned opening , the intense finale or ? most of all ? the scene where Vanessa gets introduced to Weber ( Savalas ) in a restaurant . Sergio Sollima is a gifted director , who primarily earned his fame in the spaghetti western genre ( " The Big Gundown " and " Run Man Run " ) . That's also exactly what " Violent City " often resembles ; a gritty urban western with Bronson in his familiar role of lone outlaw passing through a town where no one can be trusted . If I understood correctly , the titular violent city is supposed to be Michigan , where strangely everyone speaks a combination of English and Italian . Funny detail on the Dutch DVD-release is that the dubbing is incomplete . Some of the dialogs start in English but halfway the conversation swifts to Italian and back to English again . Not at all bothering , especially not in case you looked forward to this movie as much as I did .
404773	2020269	69895	8.0	Mass hysteria at its most intense	Just in case some stubborn people are still questioning George A . Romero's talent after his 1968 milestone " Night of the Living Dead " , we hereby present " The Crazies " ! Once again a film stuffed with subtle criticism on society and pitch black humor . " The Crazies " immediately demands your full attention with a powerful pre-credits opening sequence and the high-excitement level is upheld throughout the entire movie . The little Pennsylvanian town of Evans City is overcome with a secret , but very lethal , government virus leaving the infected either dead or incurably insane . " Trixie " initially was developed as a chemical weapon , so not one of the scientists or army officers know how to put a stop to it when innocent people are exposed to it . The simple plot and cheap elaboration are excellently camouflaged by Romero's sharp eye for detail . Right from the start , he builds up a tense atmosphere of truly realistic mass hysteria that confuses even you ? the viewer ? in not knowing which characters are infected and which aren't . They could all simply be trigger-happy Pennsylvanian hillbillies for all we know ! Although this film never really becomes " disturbing " , there are quite a few scenes that shock and that feel strangely real . You could also state " The Crazies " was quite ahead of its time because chemical warfare is much more in the picture now than it was 30 years ago , when this film got shot . Romero's premise is simple but efficient : the malfunctioning and greed of the human race is much scarier than any fictional horror monster could ever be . Best example is the military men who become eerie and threatening in their icky white suits .
405579	2020269	74285	8.0	Our little girl is becoming a woman . . . and ONE of a kind !	Spoilers AHOY ! ! ! Carrie - the movie - belongs to the finest adaptations of a Stephen King novel . I never read the book ( I don't read at all , actually ) but I can't imagine King would have wanted his story to be shown otherwise . Brian DePalma creates a terrific atmosphere here and the tension is always present . This movie is unique in many points of view . It's a perfect combination of horror and drama elements and that's not an easy thing to do . If you add a very frightening musical score to that and acting performances that are pretty close to perfection , you get the kind of film that we like to call MASTERPIECES ! ! ! The plot is pretty much the most original thing that ever came out of the pen of Stephen King . The life of a girl in her late teens , Carrie . She doesn't have any friends , she kept very close by her religious mother and most of all , she doesn't know anything about nature and growing up . When she gets her period for the first time , she's being laughed at in a very traumatic way . With the help of an understanding teacher and a few students with a good heart , Carrie is accepted at last and even invited for the senior prom . . . But , just when she thinks her luck is turning , she faces the ultimate nighmare . . . Carrie is a whole of fascinating , memorable and even touching scenes . The whole opening scene takes your breath away and then I don't even mention the entire prom scene . Horror and suspense cinema as pure as it gets . The movie is totally carried - sorry for the inappropriate use of words - by the acting performances of Sissy Spacek ( Carrie ) and Piper Laurie ( Mrs . White - Carrie's mother ) . They both were nominated for an Oscar . I don't know who won that year ( probably someone from the cast of Network ) but they didn't deserve it ! ! The Academy Award belonged to these ladies here , no doubt about that . Smaller roles by John Travolta and Nance Allen are great as well . Even William Katt did a great job here but his character looks too much like a sheep . Nice haircut dude , keep up the 70's spirit . Brian DePalma did some of his best work in the 70's and Carrie belongs to his highlights . He often gets accused of being a Hitchock imitator , but in this film he certainly proves that he can create a unique atmosphere all by himself . It has to be said . . . Carrie has one negative aspect in my opinion . Although this is nobody's fault , I would have wished the movie to be a bit longer ( that's a comment I don't give very often ) . Personally I would have loved to see a bit more background on Carrie's family situation and a better explanation of the telekinetic forces she has . Her whole mysterious powers come all of a sudden and maybe that is a bit of a shame . The supernatural elements in Carrie aren't stressed enough but that's just my opinion , of course .
405808	2020269	237045	8.0	Love is . . . Stabbing other women in the crotch for sexual kicks !	It certainly isn't love at first sight when two restaurant employees meet each other on a rainy night . She's an arrogant waitress who yells at customers and he's a shy and introvert cook who's reluctant to drive her home after work . But when they accidentally kill a crazed hitch hiker and hide her corpse , they discover murder is a mutual aphrodisiac and fall head-over-heels in love . However , their sex-life only properly functions when the blood of innocent women is shed and thus they start a vagina-stabbing killing spree across the city . Things get even more out of control when the shy cook turns into a unstoppable psychopath who goes out vag-stabbing all by himself . " Assault ! Jack The Ripper " definitely is a mean-spirited and tremendously sleazy pinku classic , but in all honestly , I expected a little more spectacle considering its rough reputation . Due to budgetary restrictions , we sadly don't see how the women get stabbed in the crotch with the razor-sharp buttering knife , but the uncanny thrusting noises as well as the women's agonizing facial expressions leave very few to the imagination . The multiple sequences in which defenseless ladies are pursued , beaten , raped and eventually stabbed quite rank among the most misogynistic and relentless images ever shown on motion picture . I can't wait to see more movies from director Yasuharu Hasebe , as he seemed to specialize in ultra-violent pinku film , such as " Rape ! The 13th Hour " and " Black Tight Killers " . The two leads give away splendid performances and provide the film with steaming hot sex sequences , demented dialogs and blackly comical undertones . The odd and rather inappropriate disco-soundtrack is awesome and the cinematography is steady . The outrageous finale , in which the guy completely goes berserk and literally butchers a room full of young nurses , will be loved by all us depraved fans of extreme cinema .
404982	2020269	47573	8.0	They don't make B-films like this anymore .	Them ! is a true classic in the genre of monster films . It actually fulfills the definition of monster films . Straight to the point ! Detecting the creatures , hunting ' em down and destroying ' em . No pointless side-stories , no melodramatic stuff . . . clean and pure entertainment . In a wide desert area , a young girl is found . Walking around in shock . She's too shocked to tell what happened to her , but the police finds the trailer she stayed in with her parents . It's completely destroyed and her parents are dead . A few other people die in a mysterious way and local police and the FBI ask for help to a famous professor and his attractive daughter . They find out what is going on and it's a complete nightmare . Due to radiation from the atomic bomb 9 years ago , ants grew in to gigantic creatures and they are out to protect their queen . In order to do that , they'll kill every person who comes to close . This was a very important film in so many ways . One of the first " gigantic mutated animals " - films who were an inspiration for many many movies . . . and still are by the way . Everything a good movie needs is present : a good script , good acting , very good creatures effects for 1954 ! ! and some appropriate humor . Also one of the greatest quotes in the history of scary films : ( after killing just one nest of ants ) " I thought we had seen the end of them by doing this " " No , what we saw was just the beginning of what will be the end of us ! " Isn't that great ?
406054	2020269	245545	8.0	Neighbors ? Everybody needs good neighbors ! !	I have very high expectations for all four episodes in Dario Argento's TV-suspense series called " Door into Darkness " , and the first installment certainly delivered already ! " The Neighbor " , directed by Argento's good friend Luigi Cozzi ( " Contamination " ) , is a good old-fashioned and suspenseful chiller that'll keep any fan of story-driven horror on the edge of his / her seats for a full hour . Clearly inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's " Rear Window " ? as Cozzi also confirms during a brief prologue ? " The Neighbor " has a rudimentary script and introduces very few characters . A young couple and their newborn son move into a seaside apartment and spend their first night in a dark living room since without electricity . They notice a rapidly growing water stain on the ceiling and as they try to confront the upper neighbor with this , they eerily discover a dead woman's body in the bathtub . Completely isolated and petrified , Luca and Stefania entrench themselves in their dark apartment , but naturally the murderous neighbor wants to dispose himself of the two unwelcome witnesses . Dario Argento is world-famous and generally worshiped for his excessive use of gory make-up effects and explicit shocks , but the thrills in " The Neighbor " are merely suggestive and bloodless . Partly , of course , because this series was made for television distribution , but the tone of this short film also doesn't fit gross situations . Cozzi successfully puts the emphasis on slow-brooding tension and identifiable characters . Even the villain isn't the typical kind of mad-raving , axe-wielding maniac , but clearly an emotionally tormented and desperate man who got pushed over a certain mental edge . The atmosphere hence becomes much more intense and plausible , and you honestly hope for the innocent young couple and their baby to make it out of there alive . The screenplay isn't entirely without flaw , however , and contains several improbabilities . For example , why would anyone move into a new apartment in the middle of the night and it certainly isn't likely to watch movies on a small and portable TV ( working on batteries ! ) during your first evening in a totally new living environment . Still , if you simply ignore these minor flaws , you'll experience an effectively unsettling and compelling thriller . The acting performances are top-notch as well . Especially Laura Belli ( " Almost Human " , " The Nun of Monza " ) leaves a great impression as the lovely young wife . " The Neighbor " is highly recommended to avid Italian cult collectors and even to less fanatic admirers of good suspense-cinema . Personally I can't wait to watch the second episode in this series , which is called " The Tram " and was director by master Argento himself .
404808	2020269	166331	8.0	A Nightmarish Trip !	I really like where the Hammer House of Horror series is going , as the quality level increases with every episode I watch ! The first one ? " Witching Time " was nothing spectacular but still fun to watch , number two ? " The Thirteenth Reunion " ? already featured the more typically Hammer trademarks and suspense and this third installment " Rude Awakening " is actually very good ! The plot may not be entirely original and plausible , but it's incredibly fast-paced and rich on atmosphere as well as tension . Denholm Elliot , the cool bloke from " Raiders of the Lost Ark " , stars as a middle-aged estate agent haunted by a series of hallucinating nightmares ? Or perhaps it's just one giant nightmare ? Or maybe he's not even asleep to begin with ! On Friday the 13th , Norman Shenley is lured to a remote and supposedly abandoned mansion where an uncanny voice tells him that he shouldn't have killed his wife . Suddenly the idea of murdering his wife and run off with his attractive secretary Lolly becomes very tempting , but Norman can't tell anymore whether his thoughts are real or all just dreamed . Peter Sasdy's directing is as surefooted as ever , as he creates confusion even among the viewers by implementing a bizarre dream / reality structure . The secretary's looks and attitude , for example , change in every dream and you never get to know the real her until the short movie's climax . " Rude Awakening " is low on explicit violence and bloodshed , but it oozes a dark atmosphere and most of the characters ? especially the supportive ones ? are pretty disturbing . It's a fantastic little film that'll keep you glued to the TV-screen for a good fifty minutes .
406607	2020269	79156	8.0	River of the Alligator God	Much more than the obvious Italian Jaws rip-off this appears to be , " Big Alligator River " is like a well-scripted and ambitious jungle-exploitation classic . The film was directed by Sergio Martino ? an eminent filmmaker in the Italian horror field ? and on many different levels it's almost like a sequel to his earlier triumph " Mountain of the Cannibal God " . That particular movie mainly draws your attention by mentioning a gruesome cannibal-tribe , but the essence of the story handled about anthropology and learning to understand the curious religions a certain primitive tribes . " Big Alligator River " is exactly like that ! There naturally is a giant alligator swimming around , devouring people , but I really defend that the actual emphasis of Martino's film lies on the African tribe members who believe that this animal represents the wrath of a native God . According the beliefs of this tribe , the Alligator-God is furious because a Western businessman built a tourist complex , neglecting the environment and recruiting the natives as slaves . Almost immediately after the arrival of a first group of wealthy tourists , both the alligator and the war-hungry tribe start a bloody killing spree . Surely , I can't deny that " Big Alligator River " cashes in on the huge success of Steven Spielberg's creature-feature milestone " Jaws " a great deal . Particularly the character of Joshua , who owns the resort and ignores all the warnings about the dangerous presence of the alligator in order not to disturb his clients , is an exact copy of the hypocrite mayor in Spielberg's movie . There are some more obvious influences of other horror movies in the script but , overall , " Big Alligator River " is a solid independent film with a fair amount of suspense , gore and admirable camera-work . Despite the fact that the DVD-cover shows a totally naked woman being eaten by the croc , the film contains few sleaze or gratuitous sex . The filming style is elegant and Martino's camera has more eye for the African wildlife than for the ravishing bodies of the female stars . Judging by the other user-comments around here , I seem to be the only one who thinks that the giant alligator looks rather convincing ( especially considering the budget of this type of movies ) and especially the many close-ups of his pupils come across as quite frightening . The acting is very satisfying and , naturally , Barbara Bach's good looks are a treat for the eyes . " Big Alligator River " is warmly recommended to fans of Italian horror .
404296	2020269	14142	8.0	Beautiful ? but I hope you have a wide attention span !	This early version of the legendary story is ( so far ) the oldest film I've ever seen . Personally , I find it fascinating to purchase movies made before my grandparents were even born . The entire concept of cinema as a form of art is scarcely out of the egg it all still looks so grotesque . I did learn something from this film ? these ancient milestones aren't necessarily brilliant but impressive beyond belief . The Hunchback of the Notre Dame often gets referred to as one of the first ? horror ' classics but much more than that , it's a historical spectacle with massive sets and groundbreaking elements . The actual plot is so easy to summarize but you get so much more than that ! Like a very detailed and imaginative portrait of Paris in the 15th century , the variety of social classes and an idea of medieval interpretation of the law . At some times in this film , you almost get the idea Quasimodo and Esmeralda are just second-class puppets in what is primarily a historical and educating documentary . Magnificent without a single doubt ? but time-consuming and ponderous to sit through ? Although , I have to say I hunt down the extended version , furnished with a stained musical track and lasting 140 minutes . The actual plot and the presentation of Quasimodo's personality is still unparalleled and touching beyond comparison . Lon Chaney is simply outstanding as the unworldly and deformed ? freak ' who's willing to sacrifice his life unconditionally to rescue the girl who once treated him in a human way . He might be hideous , but he's the only who's pure , honest and free of prejudices . Lon Chaney's facial make-up and hunch are early horror triumphs . Along with his natural charismatic appearance , the Quasimodo portrayal provided Chaney with the immortal status of horror-cinema icon . Even though he already starred in over a hundred films before The Hunchback , he'll always be remembered starting from this point of his career . Like none other actor , Chaney gave a face to Quasimodo and that is not exaggerated ! Multiple other well-respected actors gave image to Quasimodo after Chaney ( like Charles Laughton , Anthony Quinn and Anthony Hopkins ) but only he will truly be remembered for it . Same goes for Lon's personification of Erik in ' Phantom of the Opera ' which is his greatest achievement in cinema along with Hunchback . The Hunchback of the Notre Dame is over eighty ( 80 ! ) years old now and it still stands as one of the most overwhelming heavyweights in cinema ever . Some of the sequences shown here are pure mythical inheritance . Like Chaney acrobatic movements while tolling the massive bells ? or his descent off the Notre Dame's walls ! Still , this film might not be for all tastes as it's too bombastic all together and Woresly's direction is kind of rough and ponderous . He surely put too much energy in it , as it was the most ambitious project of his career . Therefore , it's hard to stay focused continuously as the shots of Medieval Parisian streets seem to be endless
404837	2020269	67321	8.0	Morbid Science Requires a Woman's Touch ?	Much rather than the trashy and exploitative cash-in it's reputed to be , " Lady Frankenstein " is , in fact , a remarkably impressive and very ingenious variation on the legendary Mary Shelley story ! It all may look silly , and of course it is sometimes , but Mel Welles ' film contains a lot more style and dazzling Gothic atmosphere than the majority of contemporary Italian exploitation flicks . There's not one boring moment in the entire film and the plot actually brings forward some bright story lines that widely surpasses the imagination of scriptwriters over at big studios like Hammer and Universal . Horror veteran and personal favorite Joseph Cotton ( " The Abominable Dr . Phibes " , " Baron Blood " ) portrays the over-ambitious and slightly obnoxious Baron slash scientist Frankenstein who gets killed by his own creation after not carefully considering the dangers of his experiments . The horribly deformed monster he resurrected escapes and starts a killing spree in the area , causing mayhem and fear among the villagers . Meanwhile , Frankenstein's intelligent but equally stubborn daughter Tania continues her father's work , using the weak-minded men at the castle as reluctant research objects . The given that the " mad scientist " is a woman in this case , is already terrific in my humble opinion , and yet " Lady Frankenstein " features two supplementary sub plots that are definitely worth mentioning . The Frankensteins , both daddy and his girl , do business with a duo of filthy-looking corpse snatchers whose characters are obviously inspired by the real-life killers Burke & Hare and , unlike in most previous Frankenstein adaptations , there's even room for sexual intrigues and romance . With her sensual charisma , it's a lot easier for Tania to convince her patients to sacrifice themselves in the name of science . . . The make-up effects are rather poor , but the set pieces are effectively uncanny and director Welles often succeeds in creating a tense atmosphere with the use of eerie sounds and a wide range of unnatural colors . Some of the mumbling supportive characters are difficult to understand , but Rosalba Neri and Joseph Cotton are a pleasure to behold and they're clearly having fun in their roles . There's quite a bit of typical euro-sleaze in this film , but it never gets too graphic or overly vulgar . The ending is just marvelous and the whole concept of a relentless feminist Doctor is strangely fascinating ! Highly recommended .
405155	2020269	55456	8.0	Hey there , sssssssssssssssssssexy !	Fans of atmospheric and story-driven 60's horror all over the world should urgently combine forces and catapult " The Snake Woman " out of oblivion and into the list of favorites ! Despite the compelling storyline and an acclaimed director in the credits ( Sidney J . Furie ) , this early 60's chiller incomprehensibly got neglected over the years , whereas other ? much worse ? horror films from that period received unnecessary fancy DVD-releases . This is a solid thriller , filmed in stylish black & white and filled with fluently written dialogues . The events take place during the late 19th century in a little Northern English town inhabited by superstitious and easily petrified people . Since many years , a brilliant scientist successfully keeps his wife's mental illness under control by injecting her with snake venom . When the wife dies whilst giving birth to a daughter , a local witch claims that the newborn child is pure evil and must be destroyed . The scientist is killed by an angry mob but the baby girl is miraculously saved with the help of an understanding doctor . 19 years later several corpses are found in the Moors , containing a lethal amount of snake poison . The frightened villagers believe that the curse of the snake woman has struck them , but the young Scotland Yard inspector doesn't believe in old-fashioned witchery and investigates the case . Sidney J . Furie impressively manages to maintain the mysterious atmosphere throughout the entire film and makes great use of the rural locations and spirit of the era . You can truly sense the fear of the villagers when they're confronted with yet another new murder and their belief in the supernatural , voodoo and evil curses is impeccably portrayed . The subject matter of venom and reptiles in general apparently got researched in detail . For example , the snake girl has no eyelids , she's highly sensitive to certain sounds and she regularly sheds her skin . It's little details like this that make mythological horror so great ! My only complaints are that the movie is too short ( runtime 68 minutes ) and that there isn't enough background to Atheris ' ( the snake woman ) character . What happened to her in those 19 years ? Does she hold a grudge against the town or does she just kill by instinct ? The acting performances are very adequate and the paranoia end sequences are typically 60's . This baby just screams for a proper DVD-release !
405908	2020269	426459	8.0	Let the Feastivities begin !	After nearly having abandoned all hope to ever state it , the time is now finally here ! Ladies and gentlemen , please welcome something entirely new and original : FEAST . This really great and immeasurably entertaining film directed by John Gulager exclusively thrives on one brilliant idea , namely it's the first and , so far , only anti-clichéd horror film of the post-2000 era . Simply put , this means " Feast " will feature guaranteed shock surprises and unexpected plot-twists . For once , you won't be able to guess which characters will get killed and in what order . Quite the contrary , I daresay that some of the characters of which you automatically expect them to survive will die and even a lot faster than you can imagine ! The element of surprise in " Feast " is totally refreshing and the characters behave so damn realistic . They're cowardly , egocentric , traitorous , whiny , despicable and extremely obnoxious , but ? face it ? this is exactly how real people would react and behave in situations where their own precious lives are in danger . As fun as it usually is to witness the good guys surviving and the bad guys getting what they deserve , in reality all you need to survive a certain ordeal is a large dose of luck . Not only does director John Gulager dispose of the right attitude and approach to make a horror film , the basic concept of " Feast " , as well as the elaboration of the script , is also quite creative and very comical . The film smoothly opens with the inventive introduction of the characters who're are all either regular guests or staff of a redneck tavern in the rural outback somewhere . The camera freeze-frames everyone to provide us with the characters ' names as well as some fun trivia , like the life-expectancy for every single character . Literally immediately after the introductions ? still during , actually ? the dark tavern is viciously attacked by a ' family ' of carnivorous creatures that vaguely look like hybrids between Razorbacks and Tremors . The awkward posse is trapped inside the tavern overnight , and they're forced to work together if at least some of them want to make it out alive . Granted , the plot is a little too skimpy for " Feast " to ever be referred to as a masterpiece in the genre , but it's full of action , incredibly fast-paced and bloody as hell ! Several people loose either their heads or limbs , get eaten or blown to pieces following a counterattack plan gone wrong . The make-up effects are very professional , gross and thankfully achieved the old-fashioned non-CGI way . The dialogs are fluently written and often really funny and the entire cast delivers spirited acting performances . Quite a few familiar faces in the cast as well , like former soft-core queen Krista Allen , Duane Whitaker , Balthazar Getty , Jason " Jay " Mewes and TV-screen legend Clu Gulager , who's the director's father . Terrific B-movie splatter fun for over-enthusiast new horror fanatics as well as elderly & more experienced admirers of the genre .
405014	2020269	74971	8.0	Murder and Mayhem in the family !	Roger Corman apparently isn't the only director who can do Edgar Allen Poe adaptations , even though he undoubtedly remains the reigning king thanks to his SEVEN masterful films during the early 60's starring Vincent Price . The least you can say about this movie is that it's a likable effort . If you compare the oeuvres of exploitation master Jess Franco and early 19th century author Edgar Allen Poe , an amalgamation of their works seems nearly impossible and ridiculous . And yet , " Night of the Skull " is a very compelling and atmospheric Gothic horror film , worthy of Poe's good reputation and a class above the majority of Franco's other movies . The screenplay is based on Poe's " The Cat and the Canary " and revolves on the despicable Marion family as they gather around to hear the will of the murdered patriarch Archibald Percival . Since his death was unnatural , the inheritors all of a sudden get to hear a completely unexpected testament that divides the family fortune differently . Then at night comes a skull-masked killer to eliminate all the family members in gruesome ways , referring to the four basic elements water , wind , earth and fire . Our good old pal Jess manages to create a wondrously sinister Goth atmosphere , complete with dark mansions near the seaside and loud thunderstorms . There's always a certain level of suspense to enjoy and the murders are impressively barbaric . Especially the first murder , that of the family patriarch , is quite creepy . This movie probably contains the smallest amount of sleaze in a Jess Franco movie ever ( even Lina Romay keeps her clothes on at all times , which is truly odd ) , but there's constant hinting at perverted themes , such as incest , voyeurism and adultery . The decors are great , the acting is more than adequate for once and the recent DVD release looks very nice . This film isn't dubbed , which is a real pleasure . Definitely top 3 Franco material , alongside " Faceless " and " The Awful Dr . Orloff " .
405527	2020269	90145	8.0	A tenement , a dirty street . . . now look your head's bowed in defeat	review title lyrics : Marc Almond ? The Days of Pearly Spencer " Tenement " is hostile , mean-spirited exploitation in which the cheapness of production is only surpassed by the brutality in tone . Also known as " Slaughter in the South Bronx " , this nasty movie perfectly lives up to his reputation of shocking urban horror class-sick ! The story opens with a gang of thugs being arrested for drug-abuses and other insane felonies committed in the basement of an apartment complex . The other tenants hope that this will finally mean the end of all crime in their neighborhood , but the gang returns the exact same night already and plots annihilate everyone in the building . The first half hour seems slow and not at all eventful but , in reality , you feel that the tension is being build up towards a claustrophobic highpoint that'll stand for pure mayhem . " Tenement " is very extreme with some of the most disturbing death-scenes ever shot on film . Luckily the special effects are so weak , because the violence is already shocking enough in concept . There's a woman raped and barbarically beaten to death , other tenants are stabbed with rusty pokers and one guy dies after a seriously sick heroine-shot . Furthermore , we have slit throats , electrocution and a truly repulsive castration . Yikes ! ! There are no real heroes among the tenants and you feel like every character has an equal chance to die ( and they most likely WILL before the movie is over ) . " Tenement ? Game of Survival " is hugely controversial cinema and easily one of the most jaw-dropping movies I ever beheld . Enter at your own risk ! !
405334	2020269	82700	8.0	Cruelty is on the menu ! !	There aren't that many horror movies about cannibalism ( at least not compared to other sub-genres like murdering maniacs or vampires or zombies ) but the ones out there enjoy a world wide status of being very controversial . Especially this movie is , along with Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust , the perfect representation of this macabre topic . In a very explicit way , both these movies show the darkest side of ( in ) humanity and there will always be at least a few sequences that shock you . . . no matter you're the most hardened horror fan or not . In my personal opinion , Cannibal Ferox is a bit better than Holocaust because of the deeper thoughts and emotions behind it . I also enjoy the style of director Umberto Lenzi over Deodato's . Cannibal Ferox starts with both a written and spoken warning that this motion picture contains at least two dozen scenes that may be seen as shocking and disturbing , and that you shouldn't watch this movie if you're quickly offended in any possible way . Usually , these warnings are very exaggerated and just an instrument of marketing but in this case , it really has a point . The gore and violence shown in this film gets under your skin a lot more as when you're watching other horror films . Just because one simple reason . . . the existence of Cannibalistic tribes is unlikely , but not completely impossible . As I said before , Cannibal Ferox is made by Umberto Lenzi . This man is obviously obsessed by horror and just like his famous - fellow Italian - colleagues Lucio Fulci and Lamberto Bava , he likes to portray it ways that don't leave much to the imagination . We're talking about eyeballs getting stabbed out , braincracking , tearing apart a complete human body and that sort of things . Unnecessary to say that people with a weak stomach better avoid it . Perhaps the most interesting aspect about Cannibal Ferox is the moral Lenzi tries to tell . Are it in fact the cannibals who're inhuman ? ? Or goes the greed , madness and curiosity of the civilized world even beyond their cruelty ? ? . . . Who ever said Italian horror is only meant to shock and offend people ? Pure talking cinema , Cannibal Ferox is far from being perfect ( or even good at times ) The acting is below average , especially in English dubbed version and there are a few obvious continuity goofs . Some sequences seem like they are " unfinished " and that makes you think Lenzi wanted to do more with it but just couldn't . All these negative elements are made up by some great nature and ' wild-life ' footage , including a few fascinating animal rituals . This means : If you're hurt more by seeing an animal suffer then when you see a human get slashed , Cannibal Ferox isn't recommended neither . If you're looking for a challenge to watch . . . Cannibal Ferox is what you need .
405116	2020269	67500	8.0	A true Spanish exploitation highlight !	I absolutely love ? love ? LOVE these seventies eurohorror-flicks ! And Amando De Ossorio's Tomb of the Blind Dead is one of the purest efforts this sub-genre brought forward ? You may expect foxy ladies , raw cinematography , creepy musical guidance and some slightly perverted undertones . The basic plot involves a creepy Spanish myth of devil-worshiping Templars who leave their tombs at night and dwell around the ruins of a deserted ghost town . The zombies look very filthy and they move in terrifying slow motion ! The few sequences in which the blind dead ( blind because their eyes were pecked out by crows ) chase their victims on their doomed horses are brilliant and some of the most effective horror ever shown . Prepare yourself for a genuinely apocalyptic ending as well , one that'll leave you speechless ! Of course , the film is filled with improbabilities and some immense structure holes , but De Ossorio's ingenious visions are so surprising that you easily forgive him for this . Highly recommended ! ! Tombs of the Blind Dead may very well the best exploitation film I've seen so far , along with ' Mark of the Devil ' ( German ) and ' Cannibal Man ' ( Spanish as well ) . Three sequels followed , but so far I haven't had the luck of tracking them down ?
406369	2020269	112887	9.0	Welcome on the road to Hell ! ! This is Araki's world	The opening credits claim this is a ' heterosexual ' movie by Gregg Araki ? Now that statement is still open for discussion . Something that isn't open of discussion is the fact Araki created one of the meanest , most good-looking pieces of trash of the 90's ! Imagine yourself a lesser-hyped version of ' Natural Born Killers ' and exclude that last bit of political correctness . It seems like Araki was testing how far he could go ? and then cheerfully exaggerated some more . The Doom Generation is a speed-driven and absurd road movie against all forms of good taste . A young couple , accompanied by a trigger-happy madman , faces the most eccentric situations and deal with the most extravagant characters . The film contains a lot of violence but even more absurd and demoralizing humor , so the whole thing never really becomes disturbing or provocative . Lots of naughty language and nudity , though ! Rose McGowan's character Amy is the closest thing to a cult / trash queen we saw in the 90's and her naked body is always a joy to behold . James Duvall ( sort of like Araki's lead in his entire teenage-alienation trilogy ) is terrific as the confused teenager with the ' whatever ' attitude ! Gregg Araki's visions are downright brilliant from time to time . Many people don't seem to think so ( just check the other comments around here ) but his film is extremely stylish and a perfect portrayal of a pop culture generation . Heck , even his colorful slang ? which includes a whole dictionary of genitalia synonyms ? alone is worth the effort . The Doom Generation is one the most special films of the past decade and it really deserves the cult-followings it developed over the years . Check it out if you're open-minded , not quickly offended and not faint of heart !
405754	2020269	101272	9.0	Black > blackest > THE ADDAMS FAMILY !	Sadly , I never actively witnessed the legendary TV-series starring John Astin as the original Gomez Addams . I'm from a younger generation so I only heard about its brilliancy by the massive cult-followings . I am a big fan of the concept of sarcastic black comedy , however , and therefore I was very much looking forward to Sonnenfeld's film . The daily rituals of this family are just great ! Mom and dad and their macabre passion for each other , siblings constantly thinking up deadly games and a bodiless hand racing around the massive castle ! It's all very black and depressingly portrayed , but the humor is hilarious and ultra-effective . The characters remain serious no matter what madness they proclaim and even the driest forms of vulgarity are considered to be the most normal things in the world ? The scenery and locations are simply brilliant and all the side-characters that pass by ? way too many to list ? carry a special place in my heart . The main storyline in ' The Addams Family ' actually is of minor importance ? A long lost uncle returns to the family , but he's brainwashed by greedy lawyers in order to steal the Addams ? fortune . Look closely to this film ? the amount of jokes and funny , little details there to discover is endless and terrifically worked out . This may very well be one of the funniest comedies I ever saw , but I can imagine it's not for everyone's tastes . Sensitive topics such as death , masochism and torture are constantly being mocked ! I just have to mention the cast ! I hope they paid good money to whoever was in charge of the casting ? Every character in the family is just delightfully chosen and ? as a viewer ? you'll always associate them with the roles they played here . Anjelica Huston as the gorgeous witch , Raul Julia ( R . I . P ) as the poetic madman , Carl Struyken as Lurch ! ! Not to mention Christina Ricci , who truly bewitched me in all possible ways . She's the same age as I am and when I first saw this film at the theater ( aged 10 ) ? I head over heels fell in love with her ! It's amazing how she gives image to Wednesday Addams ! She doesn't move a muscle when she speaks and her appearance is sexy and spooky at the same time ! ' The Addams Family ' is highly recommended entertainment and easily one of those few comedies you'll never grow tired off . The entire cast and crew returned for a sequel in 1993 ? One that is marvelous as well , by the way !
404672	2020269	880243	9.0	Requiem for an organized crime network ?	Following the huge success of the first series , mostly in its native country Belgium but on the international export market as well , a second series of " Matroesjkas " was inevitable . Most of the story lines were even readily written when the first series still aired on TV , for that matter . But still , the last thing anyone can claim is that this second series is simply a continuation and cash-in on the popularity of the original . The second ? and undoubtedly final ? series has a much more internationally orientated character , more convoluted plot outlines , the atmosphere is even more disturbing and there's a lot more violence ( especially when approaching the finale ) . Several characters of the first series return , but there are also numerous new ones that get introduced ; often even viler and more malignant than the original crime syndicate members . If you haven't seen the first series , it isn't of much use to watch part two . Even if you don't necessarily require the main characters ' backgrounds and previous crimes , there still are loads of references towards stuff that happened in the first season . The story picks up again three years later , with the earlier than expected release from prison of Ray Van Mechelen and Eddy Stoefs , two of the gang's most prominent members . They meet up to search for their former pal Jan Verplancke , who stole all their money and disappeared towards Thailand to open a sex club . They also intend to boost new life and energy into their former activities , but the Belgian sex industry has changed severely during their three years of absence . There are new and relentless players on the market ( Belgian as well as Russian mob organizations ) , docile and " cheap " girls can only still be found in poor Eastern European countries and the relationships between the former partners have watered down into sheer hostility and complete distrust . The Antwerp police continuously try to disable the organization but perhaps they don't even have to , as they are likely to kill off each other first . The carefully researched and elaborated scenarios , courtesy of Guy Goossens and Mark Punt , still pay and extended deal of attention to character development and human emotions . It's a remarkable and highly praiseworthy accomplishment ? especially for a Belgian production ? how the numerous and often extremely versatile story lines and sub plots merge together throughout all ten episodes . Whether it concerns the hopeless situation of the girls or the downwards spiral into utter madness of the villains , everything is near perfect to the greatest detail . Even more the case than in series one , part two of " Matroesjkas " isn't always suitable for viewers with a sensitive nerve system or easily upset stomachs . There's a lot of misogynic violence , brutal executions , rape , extortion , excessively foul language , mental agony and revenge . But , as I stated in my review of the first series already , what else do you expect from an allegory focusing on the sex industry ! If you want it to come across as realistic and plausible , extreme violence and exploitative sleaze are fundamental .
404992	2020269	64747	9.0	A very versatile tale of terror	We have all kind of barbarities featuring in this dark and moody tale . Only the wicked pen of Edgar Allen Poe could have come up with a tale that blends voodoo , body snatching , medical experiments , brotherly betrayal and a taste of what most likely is the worst imaginable nightmare : being buried alive ! Set in the second half of the 19th century , Vincent Price ( oh , how I love this man ) stars as a wealthy landlord who returned from Africa severely traumatized . His brother got cursed by the aboriginals there and now lives locked up in his room , heavily deformed . But he's still clever enough to plan an escape and pays some small crooks to have him appear dead . Due to several unfortunate events , the plan goes wrong and Sir Edward's supposedly dead body ends up in the laboratory of morbid scientist Christopher Lee ( another man I love ! ) The entire film carries some sort of unnameable eeriness . The depressing set pieces and colorless locations add a great deal to the sublime horrific atmosphere . All this , together with an intriguing and complex screenplay makes this movie yet another highlight in the careers of Vincent Price and Christopher Lee . Both icons of horror give away amazing performances and it's actually a damn shame they don't share many sequences together . This is a marvelous film from the time that horror still was the greatest genre in cinema . They simply can't deliver movies as good as this anymore . Maybe I'm giving it a little too much praise but you can't but agree with me that at least this kind of horror oldies demand a much wider attention span than the nowadays gore-junk . For that aspect alone , I feel obliged to give it a high rating .
405691	2020269	51994	9.0	Our Hearts Will Go On For This Version As Well ?	Roy Ward Baker's ( what a truly great but sadly underrated director this was ? ) version of the Titanic catastrophe is unquestionably one of the most astounding and technically superior adventure movies of the cinematic black and white era , but I reckon it will become very difficult to recommend it to nowadays audiences . Let's face it , why would anyone opt to see this " old " and " dated " version when the most expensive movie ever made revolves on exactly the same facts and ? moreover ? features an extra love story and stars a cast full of extremely popular faces ? Quite a lot of reviews I encountered for " A Night To Remember " state that this is the one and only version for " mature " and " demanding " audiences to see . Well , that's quite an exaggeration . I am aware that it's a popular nowadays sport to hate James Cameron's " Titanic " and , in all honesty I'm not the biggest fan of the dire fictional love-triangle plot myself , but the second half of the film ? the actual sinking ? is undeniably brilliant , staggering and unforgettable cinema . This movie , albeit half a century old by now , is staggering and unforgettable as well and admittedly it accomplishes these effects merely through factual narrative and the pure professionalism of everyone involved in the production . I presume it's rather useless to give a brief description of the plot . Everybody knows what overcame the supposedly unsinkable ship the Titanic during its maiden voyage across the Atlantic Ocean ? unless of course you just flew in from another planet ? and the screenplay of this wondrous movie ( based on a documentary book ) collected the memories and declarations of numerous survivors . Most aspects of the tragedy , like the disregarding of the weather reports , the actual collision with the iceberg and the painfully slow and clumsy evacuation of the passengers , are commonly known and also feature in pretty much every other film version , but " A Night to Remember " also fascinatingly elaborates further on the two ships that were nearest to the Titanic , namely the Carpathia and the Californian . Particularly the latter provides a jaw-dropping sub plot , as the crew never realized what dramas occurred at barely 10 miles away from them . Other small and already details about this historical event are illustrated just as saddening and emotionally moving here as they are in James Cameron's multi-budgeted blockbuster , like the faithful orchestra and the several brave and honorable crew members that sacrificed their lives for the safety of the passengers . Director Roy Ward Baker could rely on an extended but extremely dedicated cast ( including some prominent names like Honor Blackman and Michael Goodliffe ) and everything else ? like music , photography , choreography and costume designs ? are literally astonishing as well .
406112	2020269	75342	9.0	Terrific film shamefully ignored over the years !	" The town ? " is an early triumph in the serial-killer section of the horror genre , handling about a small American town terrorized by a masked murderer shortly after the end of World War II . Actually based on true events , the maniac picks out his victims on Lovers Lanes and shoots them without mercy . This important low-budget production , from the hands of the legendary producer Samuel Z . Arkoff , completely depends on unsettling atmosphere and the icky sound editing . The isolated location of a town of the edge of Texas and Arkansas has something raw , primitive and terrifying . This aspect is stressed extra by the grim voice-over that repeatedly informs us about the facts . Although you never get to know much about the killer's identity or personality , it's one of the most fascinating madmen in film history . His heavy breathing and primitive mask ( similar to the one Jason Vorhees wore in F13 part 2 ) make him look truly chilling and mysterious . What's also great about this movie is that it features so many tricks and familiar sub-plots , only they were used here of the first time ! Profiling of the killer , copycat behavior etc ? All this makes " The Town that Dreaded Sundown " a vastly underrated and film and more horror fans should reckon its brilliance . Too bad it's so hard to obtain a decent copy of it . I spent years looking for this film before finally seeing it in poor picture quality . The only few flaws to detect is the lousy and typical redneck humor that director Charles B . Pierce inserts in order to lighten the demanding tone of the film . The same mistake also almost ruined Wes Craven's " Last House on the Left " .
405217	2020269	36733	9.0	ALMOST as brilliant as its predecessor	Lewton's sequel to the almighty " Cat People " is a mesmerizing and elegant fantasy , but it is by no means a horror film . It's a touching drama and a perceptive social portrait that makes a great study on loneliness and creating an alternate dreamworld . In this case : a young girl that hasn't got much contact with her classmates because of her constant daydreaming and often alarms her parents due to her isolated position . Amy eventually finds true friendship in the supernatural form of Irena , the deceased first wife of her father . Although entirely different in purpose and message , " Curse of the Cat People " actually has a lot more in common with its predecessor than it looks . Three essential characters return and their personalities haven't changed . Irena ( played by the goddess Simone Simon ) is still a warm-hearted but frigid woman and Ollie is still a loving man incapable of handling the supernatural events around him . Basically , this sequel is quite a unique achievement in cinema as it forms a solid wholesome with the first , despite implementing an entirely different tone . There are some genuine moments of fear , but these are the result of a terrific sub-plot in which an elderly Mrs . Farren ( Amy's neighbor ) accuses her daughter Barbara of being an impostor and a replacement for her real daughter who died in an accident . The film is beautiful to look at , with a stunning photography and excellent sets . The end-sequence ( involving an imaginary metamorphosis ) is breath-taking and one of the most enchanting moments in cinema history . The acting performances are flawless and the crush I had on Simone Simon only got intenser ! Robert Wise does a terrific directing job ( his debut ) along with the unknown Gunther Von Fritsch . Wise continued working for Val Lewton one year later with the effectively creepy " The Body Snatcher " . I will probably always prefer the original " Cat People " ? simply because that is one of the most impressive and intelligent stories ever ? but this imaginative sequel is almost as brilliant . Highly recommended .
406197	2020269	462485	10.0	Troma is Back ! Gorier , trashier and more demented than ever !	The last genuine Troma class-sick got released almost a decade ago already ( " Terror Firmer " ) , but " Poultrygeist " was definitely worth waiting for all these years ! Lloyd Kaufman and C° truly surpassed themselves with this over-the-top gooey , absurd , chaotic and unbelievably entertaining splatter-flick that easily ranks amongst the eccentric production company's best efforts , next to " The Toxic Avenger " , " Mother's Day " and " The Incredible Torture Show " . This movie doesn't feature a single serious moment and the script is just a non-stop spitfire of immature toilet-humor , unsubtle political satire , goofy sleaze , retarded dialogs & song-lyrics and repulsively gross make-up effects . The crazy title doesn't only sound cool , there actually is a connection with Spielberg's ghost story " Poltergeist " , as the basic premise also revolves on the desecration of an ancient Indian burial ground , only the elaboration of the idea is slighty more grotesque . The fast-food chain American Chicken Bunker built a new restaurant in Tromaville where the cursed burial ground used to be and the furious spirits of the Native Americans invade the carcasses of the frozen chickens to attack the obese & disrespectful guests . Local dork Arbie applies for a job at ACB , only to annoy his ex-girlfriend Wendy who turned into a college-lesbian and protests against the exploitation of poor defenseless chickens . Eventually Arbie , Wendy and a handful of other survivors will have to save the world from a constantly increasing army of zombie-chickens . What a totally demented movie ! You can't really blame Lloyd Kaufman of discriminating certain races or social classes , because he offensively assaults everyone ! The satire is mainly aimed at the American fast-food industry and military propaganda , but Kaufman simultaneously makes fun of Hollywood , the battle of the sexes and every type of religious belief . The gore & splatter is nauseating and outrageous , but ? as usual with Troma ? the effect is more hilarious than shocking . You'll see people transform into humongous chickens , exaggeratedly wild fountains of spurting blood , decapitations & crushed heads , nasty green vomit and ? especially ? a whole lot of unconventional stuff either going in or coming out of people's rear end . Usually I don't even like musicals , but the song lyrics in " Poultrygeist " are equally deranged and scandalous as the rest of the screenplay . Maintaining good old Troma-traditions , this new effort also contains a lot of rancid nudity ( male & female ) , tasteless camera-work and a whole lot of delightful cameos of Kaufman's old friends , like Ron Jeremy and Trey Parker . I'm rating this for pure entertainment value and nostalgia . I really don't care if it's basically just utter crap and provocative nonsense , it's 100 % guaranteed fun
404695	2020269	60794	10.0	Brilliant and mesmerizing Gothic horror	I consider it my own personal mission to make the world aware that Mario Bava was the greatest horror director of all times and . . . with brilliant movies like this " Operazione Paura " . . . it can't be too difficult to fulfill that mission . This Gothic masterpiece easily ranks high among the most beautiful horror movies ever made , with an atmosphere that constantly causes you to gasp and a striking photography that influenced even the most successful directors in the post-Bava era . This haunting gem takes place in an early 20th century ghost town , complete with superstitious inhabitants , fog-enshrouded cemeteries and supernatural curses ! Paul Eswai is an young and ambitious coroner / doctor who's called to the town to perform an autopsy on the unfortunate Irena Hollander who died under mysterious circumstances . It doesn't take Paul long to find out that there are many more mysteries that need to be cleared out in this town . . . All the strange deaths in this town are related to the tragic accident that killed the young Melissa 20 years earlier . Has the restless soul of this girl returned to avenge her own death . . . or is it her witchy mother Baroness Graps who entrenches herself in her lonely old mansion ? The script contains a few holes ( rather big ones . . . ) but Bava cleverly camouflages them by a stunning use of color or by introducing creepy gimmicks . " Kill Baby . . . Kill " contains some truly horrific , yet masterful oddities that have been copied numerous times since , like the constant eerie use of mirrors , a ball bouncing through corridors in slow-motion or the mesmerizing spiral-staircase sequence . The absolute best sequence can't even be put into words , so great it is ! I won't spoil it , though . . . it involves a bizarre pursuit by the hero himself but you have to watch the film in order to believe what happens . The camera-work is outstanding , the color pattern is powerful and the filming location is really breathtaking ! The town is a nightmare place . . . and this is wonderfully illustrated with dying trees . . . ramshackle building and the very unappealing inn . This is subtle and atmospheric Gothic terror , so you shouldn't expect large amounts of bloodshed or sleaze . Don't be alarmed , though , because this film evokes shocks and nightmares without a single gruesome image . " Kill Baby . . . Kill " is at least ten times scarier than , for example , " the Shining " and yet no one ever mentions it . It's about time Mario Bava receives credit for his achievements .
406236	2020269	36261	10.0	Beautiful . . . One of the greatest stories ever told .	It doesn't happen very often , but I was touched by this film . It's not the first adaptation of the story that I've seen , but it sure is one of the best . In fact , only the silent version starring Lon Chaney beat this version . That version is of course an absolute masterpiece , but I easily dare to say this is one too . It doesn't strictly follow the original storyline as you know it but that alright . You're just staring at it with your mouth wide open ( at least , I was . . . ) Claude Rains is just perfect in his role as the phantom . Because of his flawless performance , you feel what he feels and you have get the idea you would take the same actions as he does in this movie . Rains plays Eric Claudin . A rather anonymous violin player in the famous opera of Paris . In all the years he worked there , he grew a strong passion and love for the young and talented singer Christine Dubois . He even wrote a concert for her . But , he's getting older and he gets fired . His only hope now to keep seeing Christine , is to sell his concert and let her sing the main voice . When he gets the idea a production company stole his music , he snaps and attacks a man . During the struggle , Claude gets mutilated horrible by burning acid . From then on he lives in the opera building does everything to make Christine a star . . . even if that means other people have to die in a brutal way . I can't praise this film enough . It's just perfect in my opinion . The acting , the story , the shock-effects and above all . . . the wonderful music . I must admit , if you're not a big fan of opera music , this film will certainly be annoying to you . But hey , you can expect classical music in a version of Phantom of the Opera right ? If you can appreciate a bit of opera singing , this film will have another great extra value to you . I say SEE IT . My humble opinion on Phantom of the opera = . A must see ! ! !
405008	2020269	90197	10.0	Deeply disturbing Spanish masterpiece	The only word that spontaneously comes to mind when briefly describing Agustí Villaronga's " In a Glass Cage " is ? WOW ! This is definitely one of the most intense and harrowing European films ever made . You're most likely to find it in the horror-sections of specialized cult stores / catalogs , but it's SO much more than just horror ! It's a traumatizing post-WWII portrait , a deep psychological drama and a devastating tale about pedophilia & child murder . " In a Glass Cage " is the disturbingly cold and emotionless depiction of a former Nazi figure that escaped to Spain in time , but continues his sick rituals of kidnapping and murdering young boys there . Until one day , feelings of shame and remorse take over and Klaus ( Günter Meisner ) attempts to commit suicide by jumping of a high building . He survives but becomes bound to an iron lung machine and a huge burden to his unknowing wife and daughter . Then , a handsome but strange adolescent man volunteers to be Klaus ' nurse . Angelo seems to know a lot about Klaus ' past and unorthodox desires , yet he doesn't betray him and even offers him the chance to pick up where he left off . An odd escalation of happenings causes Angelo to turn into the most powerful person in the house AND an even bigger monster than Klaus ever was . This often shocking and uncompromising film shows , in a truly alarming style , what possibly could happen to the young and vulnerable minds of pedophilia victims . It might not sound very realistic at first , but when you think it over more carefully , it becomes frighteningly real . Angelo's heartless attitude and charisma come across exactly like those of someone whose childhood innocence was taken from him . Apart from being a truly thought-provoking piece of cinema , " In a Glass Cage " is also an impeccably made and mesmerizing stylish film . The atmosphere is creepy and sinister throughout , with depressing set pieces , sober music and monotonous camera-work . Unquestionably the most staggering piece of scenery is the large iron lung ( the titular glass cage , also ) that breathes for Klaus . This impressive and advanced medical device constantly produces uncanny noises and it looks like the absolute last type of machinery you want your life to depend on . It's a very original and genuinely horrifying object to feature in a tense film like this . Furthermore , there are a couple of shocking scenes that you aren't likely to see in many other films . It already requires a lot of courage to tell a story about pedophilia and child murder , so you can imagine the brutal impact of actually showing these topics graphically ! Villaronga's directing is straightforward and acting performances of the entire cast are flawless and deeply moving . " In a Glass Cage " is a brilliant film , perhaps not accessible for everyone , but enormously recommended to hardcore cult fans .
