432929	2171244	924498	1.0	Worst writing I have ever seen	This is probably the only review of this film that will ever be written . I struggled mightily to get through it and I seriously doubt that anyone else would have such stamina . An obscure yet tame women-in-prison / revenge flick from Asso Asia films starring Susan Lee , Stella Jone and Laura Sode-Matteson . One " Black " woman is actually an Asian actress in black makeup with an afro wig ! The technical quality of this film is really remarkable . The lighting and camera work were impressive . However , the writing was absolutely atrocious . I can only be thankful that the writer and director and main stars , except for Laura Sode-Matteson never got another film to ruin . This is a perfect drive-in flick as there would be nothing on the screen to distract you from what you are doing in your car . Laura Sode-Matteson actually played Jack Lord's secretary on Hawaii 5-0 for seven episodes and then went on to a long career as a location manager , most recently for Pirates of the Caribbean : At World's End .
432376	2171244	372859	2.0	Out of the Fog comes zombie clowns	I've seen this before at least twice . Many have seen the Fog and the premise is basically the same , but the Fog was much better . Zombie fans may have also seen Zombie Lake . A Jesus Franco production that was not much better , but it had features this film could only dream of . I only watched this to see Debbie Rochon . It was also nice to see Brinke Stevens , as I will delve more into her later . Fans of either Scream Queen will be disappointed , but if you are not a fan of either , you will be disgusted at the low quality of this film . Zombie clowns eating body parts , but that's it .
433448	2171244	462359	2.0	I like the name Anya .	I need to say something positive about this movie . Anya is a good name . I like the name Anya , and I hope she gets some better directing assignments in the future . That is just about it . I can't say anything about the writer . I mean , look at these memorable lines : Jay : Look , If We Stay Out Here We're Gonna Freeze or Josh : What Is It ? Jay : I Don't Know or Karen : What Was That ? or Jay : Where Are We ? or Karen : What Are You Doing ? Jay : Opening The Door . . . They don't get any better . I don't recall seeing Tara Reid in another movie . She might have been in something I've seen , but I don't recall her . Some say this movie is a step up from Alone in the Dark . Thanks for the warning . I will definitely stay away from that one . Please , find something else to do . Clean your closets , wash the dog or car , just don't waste your time here .
432930	2171244	74729	2.0	Grindhouse Experience	Bruno Mattei , often called the Ed Wood of Italian cinema , started his directorial career with Nazi exploitation films , then moved to women in prison movies , and now directs zombie movies . he actually acted in Lucio Fulci's Zombie 3 ; I guess to learn the genre . This is his second attempt at Nazi camp films , and it is poorly made . The lighting is absolutely atrocious and that is better than the acting . The effects are non-existent , so the experimentation they were doing has no effect . It is just an interesting look at the sickness the Nazi's were working on , like transplanting a uterus , or reviving frozen pilots with women's bodies , or poison bullets to make people suffer more . Naturally , since this is an exploitation film , you see a whole lot of full frontal nudity , degenerate monsters who rape , and some really creepy Nazi commandants and wardens . It is funny in that I have seen a lot of girl fights in movies , but in this film , they always manage to get totally naked when they fight .
432371	2171244	339091	2.0	Hot babes and hot lead .	Sistas in da hood . Looking for revenge and bling bling . Except da hood is a wild west town in the late 1800s . I do not remember any westerns like this when I was growing up . What would Randolph Scott say ? If he saw Lil ' Kim , he might say , " Alright ! I have to admit that I tuned into this just to see her . Bare midriffs and low cut blouses are not the staple of the usual cowboy flick , but these are the cowgirls , and they are fine . Now , don't go looking for any major story here , and the usual stuff of ghetto crime drama are here in a different setting . And , when's the last time you heard John Wayne call someone , " Dawg " ? And , I don't remember the Earp brothers hugging and kissing before they marched to the OK Corral . I watch this on BET , so I missed the action that got it an R rating , but I doubt if I will buy the DVD to see it unless I can be assured it was Lil ' Kim in that action .
433540	2171244	147507	3.0	Wake me when it's over .	When is a Limited Collector's Edition 2-Disc Set not a bargain ? When one of the movies is this one . Ronnie Sortor wrote , directed , edited and acted in this low budget indie flick . He also uses the same cast in all his movies , so if you like them in this film , they will likely be in another . Unfortunately , I couldn't find anything to like about any of them . Action got hot an heavy for a couple of minutes during the robbery , but then it died . Too many shots of actors just standing there supposedly thinking . The worst part of it all was the dude with a gut shot . Now , I have never had a gut shot , but i would imagine it to be very difficult to be running through the woods , and up and down stairs in a house with a bullet in my gut . Just seems stretching things for me , and it really bugged me throughout the film to see the guy doing it .
434166	2171244	382625	4.0	Did that old cannabis charge finally catch up with me ?	Do you love a good mystery / thriller ? How about one that is supposedly based on fact ? How about one that takes place in Paris and the UK ? If you do , then this film has every thing you could be looking for in a movie . Ron Howard and Tom Hanks had an impossible job . Making a credible film on the tail of a hugely successful book . They managed to make a film that was interesting and exciting , and it had a great score , and superb sound and visual effects . Yes , I read the book , and I even knew about the Templars and Opus Dei before I read the book . I also read the book that The DaVinci Code was based upon . I knew the premises and that did not spoil the book for me , just as reading the book did not spoil the movie . Tom Hanks did a great job , Ron Howard did a great job , Audrey Tautou was delicious , and , of course , Sir Ian was fantastic .
433126	2171244	370032	4.0	I've never failed to complete	I loved Kurt Wimmer's Equilibrium , and I hear that the DVD of this movie will have 30 more minutes that were cut from the theater version , but I am not sure that is enough . The movie is just too cartoonish for me . I know it comes from a comic book , but I really felt like I was playing a video game rather than watching a film . There has to be a limit to capability . Even Superman is felled by kryptonite . Ultraviolet seems to always come out on top without getting a scratch . A back story would have greatly improved the film , and maybe that is what is in the 30 minutes the studio cut . I enjoyed seeing Milla Jovovich , but 88 minutes of her in the same outfit is a bit much .
432129	2171244	430239	4.0	Lots of waiting	Poor Danielle ( Cerina Vincent ) . While she waits to return to the house on Haunted Hill , she is stuck in a ranger tower in the woods of British Columbia . Maybe she can pass the time with that weed they are famous for up there . But no , she takes solace in a bottle of vodka and agonizes about driving drunk and killing her friend . In the meantime , there is an alien-like creature stalking the wood killing people . We get lots of screaming and heavy breathing from Danielle while the creature attacks her . But It never kills her as it does every other person . Why ? Who knows ? The best aspect of this film is the scenery . I have to admit that it was absolutely beautiful . But , I wanted a horror movie , not a nature film .
433991	2171244	64369	4.0	Ghastly , just Ghastly	This film was released in the UK under the name Blood Rites . It was banned outright and never submitted again for release . As The Ghastly Ones , it was supposedly a hit with the horror hungry denizens of New York City's famed 42nd Street Grindhouse circuit . If you are looking for some bloody horror , then you will find it in this film . Unfortunately to see the developmentally disabled Colin ( Hal Borske ) chomp down on a live rabbit , you have to put up with shaky 16mm camera work that makes Ed Wood look positively marvelous . Three sisters are to spend three days in the family homestead with their husbands before the old man's money is disbursed . Naturally , in such a situation , people start dropping dead . Family secrets are exposed and lots of blood is spilled , especially during a gruesome dismemberment . Maybe it was the bunny bit that the Brits objected to , I know I did .
434367	2171244	221263	5.0	Perfect for the raincoat crowd	I think this will be it for the exploration to see what played in Times Square grindhouse in the sixties . This is perfect grindhouse fare . The drug-induced orgies that are part and parcel of the photographers and models who seek pleasure in whatever form . It's all her for those who enjoy boobies and asses and fruit fetishism ( Oh ! what that girl did with a banana ! ) and a little S & M thrown in for the folks that get off on that . All comes to a crashing end as one model turns on two others with a meat cleaver . Did she pick that up at the store on the way or does she carry it around in her purse ? No dialog , except for the narrator ; this was just pure bodies in motion for your enjoyment .
432617	2171244	858479	5.0	People like you and me don't need to compensate .	My first impression of this movie was that the casting was brilliant . I must have been right as I see they were nominated for a casting award . Dennis Quaid was a perfect pick for a burnt out , pompous professor , who was self-absorbed to the point of nausea . What Sarah Jessica Parker saw in him was completely beyond me . The fact that she would even speak to him after their " date " was incredible . Thomas Haden Church was brilliant as a loser brother reminiscent of The Dude - get him a bathrobe . Now , Miss Page , while channeling Michael J . Fox in a Growing Pains performance , was a disappointment . No , not her performance , but having Juno with a picture of Ronald Reagan on her wall was just too much to stomach . Ultimately , the great casting couldn't make up for an over-worn story that left me as cold as a Bush farewell address .
433070	2171244	117826	5.0	Oh my God , it's a necrophiliac's wet dream !	With Dennis Miller , you can expect that this will not be the usual Vampire movie . He makes constant references to movies , TV stars , and other personalities throughout . It is hard to believe that he didn't get writing credit as i imagine many of the lines were his . That's just a guess . Dennis certainly has his eyes on Erika Eleniak ( Under Siege ) throughout , as do we . She can't hide behind that uptight Christian persona , and she gets to come out of her shell and deliver what all of us that despise Deniss Miller wanted to see . It also features Angie Everhart ( First to Die ) as the head vampire . The first fire-top on Glamour magazine , Angie didn't give us the display she had in Jade , but she was hot hot hot throughout . Unfortunately , she was really hot towards the end . Lots of gore and sexual innuendo . Despite his best efforts , Miller did not completely ruin the film .
432390	2171244	100514	5.0	If you want a guarantee , buy a toaster .	You've seen it all before . There just aren't any new ways to tell the story of the veteran cop and the rookie . Even Clint Eastwood has done it before as Harry Callahan . So , if you like Clint Eastwood ( starred and directed ) and Charlie Shhen , then maybe this is worth your time . I tuned in for a chance to see Raul Julia and Sonia Braga . This is at least the fourth film they have done together , and they are all worth watching . It isn't Moon Over Parador or Kiss of the Spider Woman or The Burning Season , all of which got Braga and Julia Golden Globe nominations , and one actual win for Julia , but they are so good together , I just can't miss the chance to see them . So , I'll watch another veteran-rookie film where I know the ending before it even gets started . I'm just a sucker that way .
433157	2171244	397105	5.0	Why did they make this movie ?	There was nothing special about this movie . Dirty cops and mobsters and murdered prostitutes and crooked politicians have all be in many movies and at the same time . There just wasn't any reason for this movie to be made , especially considering that it was made so badly . Austin Pendleton ( A Beautiful Mind , The Notorious Bettie Page ) was just about the most evil mobster I have ever seen . There just wasn't a good bone in his body . He seriously seemed to enjoy being evil . I have to admit he was fun to watch , but it still didn't make the movie worthwhile . Georgian actress Nutsa Kukhianidze was also good and I fully intend to look for more of her films ( The Good Thief , A Trip to Karabakh ) . Tip for filmmakers : If your film is going to be crap and you are going to get an R rating , make it truly worth an R .
433152	2171244	109099	5.0	I must have missed something	I was anxiously awaiting the chance to see this movie . I had only seen Viggo Mortensen in Hildago and A Hostory of Violence . I can't wait for Alatriste to come out on DVD as it will probably never play in my theater as I am a huge Perez-Reverte fan . I was really disappointed . I know this is early stuff , but it just did't seem to have much point . Infiltrating the mob to catch them is old , and the Japanese-Italian angle is interesting , but this just had a few interesting moments in between a lot of shooting . Mortensen did not get much good dialog . The only really good part of the movie was the culture clash . Maybe a second viewing will make a difference , but I doubt it .
434132	2171244	377744	5.0	Be careful what you wish for . . .	OK , so it wasn't some blockbuster that had a chance at an Oscar , but it did win a couple of awards at film festivals . You won't see brilliant acting or compelling dialog , but it was worth watching just to bring into focus the contributions of Latinos to our daily lives and our economy . You may be feeding on a steady diet of Lou Dobbs ' anti-immigration screed and not realize just how important Latinos are to the United States . Their contribution to out food supply and their presence in every aspect of our lives , not to mention the great Latino actors that we would miss . It was the documentary part of this mocumentary that was satisfying and worthwhile . Check it out on the tube - you won't be disappointed ; and you'll get a few laughs with your information .
433659	2171244	71675	5.0	Hunting and killing babies doesn't seem to be my specialty .	The first of a trilogy by Larry Cohen , and apparently he wants a do-over as this film is currently in post-production , having been remade with a new cast , and probably scarier effects . It's scary enough as Frank and Lenore ( John P . Ryan and Sharon Farrell have a baby that is a little bit abnormal . Frank tries to kill his baby , but has a change of heart at the last minute . This is truly a baby only a parent could love , and they do . I remember Ryan back from Death Wish 4 : The Crackdown , as some wacky drug dealer . he is a little more controlled in this film , and it is a fair watch .
433263	2171244	331334	5.0	That Felissa Rose can sure scream	It seemed like a stereotypical dysfunctional family , presumably Italian-American , on a trip through the woods in New Jersey . They break down and , like the back roads of Texas , they come upon things they should have left alone . Felissa Rose seemed more like the daughter than the wife , but I'll play along . If Frank ( Salvatore Paul Piro ) can get a wife like that , there is hope for me . Major screams from Felissa Rose , putting her at the head of the class as a Scream Queen . Creepy , bloody , suspenseful fun makes for a good scary pic with some very weird characters .
432241	2171244	82696	5.0	Madman Marz . He's real .	Reportedly a slasher classic , I am appreciative of Fearnet . com for providing this for free . Check it out . The Friday the 13th campfire tale comes to life . Everyone was warned not to go into the woods alone , but one by one they succumb by not heeding the advice . Really , they were looking for Richie ( Jimmy Steele ) , so he is responsible for all their deaths . I can't figure why the Madman only went after the camp counselors , and not the kids . Gaylen Ross , from Dawn of the Dead , is Betsy , who gives us an oh so brief skintastic moment getting into the hot tub with TP ( Tony Fish ) . Stacy ( Harriet Bass ) always seemed to be lucky , just missing Madman . But even her luck runs out . Like Dave ( Seth Jones ) , she ends up losing her head . Ellie ( Jan Claire ) provided more screams than one could stand . And , that darn Richie survives it all .
432690	2171244	112857	6.0	Washington is just so cool in this film	A good film noir by Carl Franklin ( One False Move ) , with great cinematography by Tak Fujimoto ( " John Adams " , The Sixth Sense ) . Denzel Washington is fantastic as ' Easy ' Rawlins , with Don Cheadle as his buddy , Mouse . They battle Tom Sizemore in their quest to find Daphne Monet ( Jennifer Beals ) . You have the look and feel of the 30s throughout with the costuming , the cars , the talk , the cops , and the feel of the movie . It was a great nostalgia trip . Lisa Nicole Carson ( " Ally McBeal " ) also added some excitement before her premature death . This was based on the first of Walter Mosely's Easy Rawlins books , and it is a good one .
433114	2171244	493404	6.0	I gotta get that bastard !	I tend to be attracted to any movie featuring Sid Haig ( The Devil's Rejects , House of 1000 Corpses ) . Add vampire to the theme and you have me hooked . This isn't a traditional vampire tale , but more a film noir thriller where a group of vampire hunters is seeking the brother of a rich CEO ( William Snow ) . The brother was bitten in Romania . Meanwhile , the vampires themselves are hunting the same brother to prevent the resurrection of " Vlad Bossei " a super-vampire who lived in the 12th century . There film is definitely nonlinear as we jump from today , where Carrie ( Pratt ) is a captive of Pashek ( Haig ) and Fork ( Wes Ramsey ) ; to yesterday , where they are trying to get information out of Stanis ( Ken Foree - Rob Zombie's Halloween , The Devil's Rejects ) ; to last week to get the full story . Victoria Pratt ( " Mutant X " , Kraken : Tentacles of the Deep ) is the leader of the vampire hunters , and does a very good job in this film . I also enjoyed Wes Ramsey's performance . The twist at the end screams sequel .
434441	2171244	365265	6.0	The day of reckoning - the day the curse grew stronger in the Red and the Black . Sisters united in blood , together forever .	I haven't seen the first two films in this series , but that is unimportant as this third film takes place 200 years before the first one . I am always drawn to films about werewolves and vampires . The shapeshifters have always intrigued me and the overt sensuality of the films is a plus . I say sensuality , as there is not sexuality in the roles of the two sisters , Ginger ( Katharine Isabelle ) and Brigette ( Emily Perkins ) . They just exude sensuality in their every move and manner of dress . Other than the two stars , and some Native American legend , this is pretty much just the same werewolf film you have ever seen in a different package . I am now ready to watch the first two .
433778	2171244	462338	6.0	It is your moment to be clean .	There is a great story in there somewhere , I just had difficulty finding it . Lasse Hallström's direction was lacking , in my humble opinion , and the story of the greatest hoax in publishing appeared disjointed . I was drawn to the film for one simple reason , much as I imagine many were drawn to see Richard Gere , to see Julie Delpy . She had an extremely small role as Nina Van Pallandt , but that was still the juiciest part of the film . Richard Gere and Alfred Molina were spectacular in their performances , and that is what makes the film worth watching . Gere as Clifford Irving was extremely fascinating and a perfect choice to play a smooth con man . Molina , as his friend and co-conspirator , was equally fascinating as he look as if he would have a heart attack at any moment . To think that this could have went as far as it did is incredible , and anyone wanting to see a piece of 70s history done by fine actors should give it a go .
432345	2171244	87799	6.0	You were born with an asshole , Doris , you don't need Chuck .	The disadvantage of having a long movie queue is that you forget why you put a movie on there in the first place . this is one of those that I just can't remember . Maybe it was on a list of zombie movies someone recommended . This must be Houston with all the big hair . Oh , it's the eighties . Well , the comet has come and everyone outside seems to have disappeared , except for some who were only partially exposed . they are the zombies ( or " infecteds " to purists ) . Regina ( Catherine Mary Stewart ) , her sister Sam ( Kelli Maroney ) , and a trucker , Hector ( Robert Beltran ) , are apparently alone except for some scientists in the desert they reached by phone . They decide to do what all teen girls do - the go to the mall . They find four others there , but they have evil on their mind . Things get interesting when the scientists show , including B-Queen Mary Woronov and Geoffrey Lewis . OK , just a couple of zombies , no tatas , and no gore . Cute look at an eighties horror spoof .
433859	2171244	299422	6.0	What happens in Vegas . . . . .	OK , so it isn't a great movie . Who cares ? It has Maria Bello and that's enough for a peek if you have nothing else to do . She plays a con artist who takes advantage of the saying , " What happens in Vegas , stays in Vegas . " In this case , it's what happens 100 miles from home doesn't matter . Businessmen at a corporate training trip taking advantage and getting caught . The movie spends a lot of time filming the trainer . Time wasted that would have been better spent film Miss Bello . Our loss . Also stars Dawn of the Dead's Jake Weber , and The Ring's David Dorfman as father and son . There are a bunch of others in the movie , but hey , I'm watching because of Maria Bello so i really don't care about them .
432252	2171244	69979	6.0	Good Italian spaghetti crime flick	Everyone is familiar with Lee Van Cleef from the spaghetti westerns - Return of Sabata , For a Few Dollars More , The Good , the Bad and the Ugly - but , he also made spaghetti crime flicks , too . This one , produced by Dino de Laurentiis and directed by Michele Lupo , also stars Tony Lo Bianco , who is a familiar movie name on both sides of the law . This was in his younger , thinner years , and he plays a small-time hood that is infatuated with big boss Frankie Diomede ( Van Cleef ) , who pays him no attention until he saves his life . Neat car chase down the mountains and lots of killer by gun , drill and freezer . And skintastic display by Edwige Fenech ( Hostel II ) , who has many many skintastic moments to her credit .
434480	2171244	83064	6.0	Ah , you'll die all right !	I like Burt Reynolds ( Boogie Nights ) playing a cop , and he didn't do too bad as a director here either . He had a great supporting cast of cops and criminals : Vittorio Gassman makes a great crime boss ; Henry Silva ( Ghost Dog : The Way of the Samurai ) makes a great psychopath ; Brian Keith ( " Family Affair " ) , Charles Durning ( The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas ) , Bernie Casey , and Richard Libertini ( A Grandpa for Christmas ) all make great partners ; and , there is , of course , Rachel Ward ( " The Thorn Birds " ) , who got a Golden Globe nomination out of her performance . Lots of action , superb performances , and a great story .
434399	2171244	140588	6.0	Anti-war nazisploitation	While this isn't one of the infamous nazisploitation video nasties like Gestapo's Last Orgy or Love Camp 7 , it would have probably made the list if they tried to release it in Britain . It is nazisploitation , make no mistake , even though it has more of a story than the similar Salon Kitty . A Jewish couple are separated by war and she ( Sirpa Lane ) is sent to a love camp to service German soldiers . It includes an average of about eight breasts a minute , rape , actual penetration , lesbianism , bloody caning , eugenics , girl-on-girl , : all the features of a typical nazisploitation . Soon Hannah ( Lane ) attracts the attention of a Nazi officer ( Giancarlo Sisti ) , who takes her home . She fits right in , which is not surprising for someone who let her mother ( Margherita Horowitz ) die for her before she was captured . Her reunion with her beloved Klaus ( Roberto Posse ) , who was now a German officer , was not pleasant . She ends up running a high-class brothel like Salon Kitty , without the Caberet singing . She re-finds her identity before she dies . WWII aficionados will appreciate the extensive use of actual war footage in the film to stretch it out with little cost .
432508	2171244	490084	6.0	Mom's ass is so tight , it's vacuum sealed .	I have no idea why this movie is so hated by critics , including some of my flick friends . I felt that Diane Keaton ( Annie Hall , Reds ) was absolutely the perfect helicopter mom . Raised in a generation when you were kicked out of the house at 18 and sent to make it on your own , I find the phenomenon of helicopter parents to be amusing . Mistakes are made by all of us . That is how we learn . It's OK to pick us up when we fall , but it is not OK to run around and try to prevent falls . Keaton as Mandy Moore's mom was the perfect example of the bad parent . I wanted to strangle her ! Moore was really good as someone trying to find love and not doing so well . She managed to make the right decisions at the right time , but for the wrong reasons . No matter . She lands on her feet and mom learns her lesson . Sure , this is a film that will probably land on Lifetime real soon , but it was deliciously funny and people should look at it with different eyes . They may just like it .
434425	2171244	71517	6.0	That's my sister , baby , and she's a whole lotta woman .	One of the better blaxploitation films with Pam Grier kicking butt and looking o so fine as she does it . The yellow dress that she wore as a hooker was mouth watering to say the least . Rape and revenge are the main threads running through the film , as she is on the warpath to avenge her lover , who was killed by the scumbags she is now working for . Lots of people die . Also features Sid Haig , who is familiar not only in director Jack Hill's other films like Coffy and Spider Baby , again , with Grier in Tarantino's Jackie Brown , and also in Rob Zombie's films House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects .
432467	2171244	102370	6.0	" Neat " ? Anyone who says my show is neat has to go .	I have always been fascinated with Madonna . I feel that she has been unfairly maligned over the years , as are many who stretch the envelope with new ideas and thinking . I have to admit I tuned into this documentary just to see Pedro Almodovar . I hadn't realized that Madonna had a thing for Antonio Bandaras and she got to meet him at a party thrown in her honor by Almodovar . Unbelievable , that she lost out to Melanie Griffith . Seeing Madonna backstage shines a whole new light on her and makes her out to be someone who really cares about putting on a good show and , more importantly , shows her as someone who loves every - black , white , gay , straight - it doesn't matter . Everyone except Kevin Costner , who had the audacity to call her show " neat . "
433524	2171244	443706	6.0	Oh God , save us all .	I am not sold on this film . At over two and a half hours , it seemed as long as the investigation itself . Why didn't David Fincher give us a tight and exciting film like Se7en ? Yes , the investigation had an impact on many people other than those who were killed , and Jake Gyllenhaal , Mark Ruffalo , Robert Downey Jr . did a credible job of showing that , but there just wasn't the emotion that we saw with Brad Pitt . It just seemed like a long , boring investigation of little things that suggested who the killer might be . The bottom line is despite a few award nominations , the film won none , and that is because there are many better films out there . I expected a lot and was sorely disappointed .
433565	2171244	373889	6.0	Harry Potter . . . You will lose . . . everything .	I actually got the opportunity to see this today and was mesmerized by the increasing maturity of the movies in the series . It actually was more of an adult film that the previous ones and makes me think that we are in for a treat with the next two . The usual gang is back , and there are some great performances . I particularly liked Richard Griffiths ( Vernon Dursley ) in his brief appearance ; Natalia Tena ( Mrs . Henderson Present , About a Boy ) was the first really attractive adult in the films ; Gary Oldman ( Sirius Black ) was also excellent ; Alan Rickman ( Snape ) is a favorite ; and , of course , Ralph Fiennes as Lord Valdamort . I really liked the performance of Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange . I am looking forward to seeing her again . And the addition of unknown Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood was brilliant casting . The ending fights were spectacular and worth the price of admission . This was definitely the best yet and makes me anxious for number six .
433279	2171244	71240	6.0	I felt like I was watching a documentary	This was New Mexico , but I have seen many such facilities during my time as a foster caseworker over nine years in Texas . The only thing that was outside my knowledge was the isolation . I cannot imagine that any facility has a solitary confinement room . The terrible tragedy of young women depicted in this film was real . Abuse and neglect by parents who cannot and will not take the time to raise their children properly and are surprised when they rebel . Christine never had a chance . She was kicked out by an abusive father and a mother who could not defend her . She was probably getting beaten herself . She was thrown in with too many others who had problems of their own that were not being addressed . After abuse at home and in the system , she hardened just like prisoners do and was forever lost . 15-year-old Oscar nominee and Golden Globe winner Linda Blair was magnificent in this realistic film .
432944	2171244	350774	6.0	Kinda goofy and very gory	This isn't the American version of Shaun of the Dead . It really started out slow and wasn't going anywhere until one of the group started dancing around in a pool of blood on the floor . Every once in a while the action is interrupted by some twanger who is trying to reveal what is happening through song . Once the box is opened , the zombies are unleashed and then things do get interesting with a slew of killings that involve blood , cymbals , blood , garden clippers , blood , claw hammers , blood , decapitations , etc . Lots of spewing and dying . Director Matthew Leutwyler must be doing something right as he is supposedly directing a remake of Creepshow .
432215	2171244	117427	6.0	Another chance to see Halle Berry	OK , not the greatest movie in the world , and the outcome is fairly predictable , but it was another opportunity to see Halle Berry , and I cannot pass that up . Besides that , I am trying to get my teaching certificate , so I watch teacher movies , no matter how silly . I understand that it is also based upon a true story . In addition , it also featured Eliza Dushku ( Buffy , Tru Calling ) , Casey Affleck ( brother of Ben ) , and James Belushi . It wasn't memorable , but it was cute and not a total waste of time . Also , it was written by Barry Morrow , a member of the Association of Retarded Citizens , the National Association of Social Workers , and the Austism Society of America - a lifelong advocate for the rights of persons with disabilities . That puts him solidly in my camp as I am also a member of NASW and work with the developmentally disabled . Morrow won an Oscar for writing Rain Man .
432261	2171244	395585	6.0	I wouldn't be praying .	Former cameraman Steven R . Monroe directed this little psychological movie that at times was slow as molasses , but , nevertheless , an interesting glimpse of the beast within all of us . Now , I cannot compare it to Cube , Saw , or My Little Eye , as others have done as i have not seen those films . I only mention them to give you an indication of what is in store for those that have . What I can say , is that I find the premise totally believable . When the pressure is on , our hatreds and prejudices , and inner demons come out rather quickly , especially when fueled with alcohol and hunger . Only Father Duffy ( Dennis Hopper ) and Lea ( Kelly Brook ) seemed to keep their cool , but they broke down eventually , albeit for different reasons than the others . This is not a bloody film , although there is a little , but a psychological one . I was bothered by one killing that occurred off-camera , as i kept thinking the rest of the film that it was fake . The ending was weird , foreshadowing a possible sequel , but , if they do , please get another writer . Philippe Vidal's screenplay just didn't cut it for the most part . I enjoyed the film , but it could have been way better . What a waste of a Maxim magazine " Hot 100 of 2005 " list member . Another cast member was a FHM's 100 Sexiest Girls member , and another gave an outstanding display in Eyes Wide Shut . All were wasted here .
432187	2171244	114367	6.0	Wasp Woman meets Robo Cop	It is amazing what you'll find at 4am . This was certainly one that I should have skipped and tried to get back to sleep . It's far into the future and on a mining camp the robots are loose . They are cute little things that look like doggie-sized metal T-Rexs . Got the picture . But they also can assume human shape . So watch out . Your best friend may not be real . Better see if he bleeds . Peter Weller ( RoboCop ) didn't have Nacy Allen around to help him , so he relied on Jennifer Rubin ( Roger Corman's Wasp Woman ) . They made a nice pair , but he still cut her hand to check if she bled . She kissed him after that . What a woman will do when there are no other men around ! Lots of shooting at these screaming robots , but not much else .
433999	2171244	73756	7.0	If you've got to fight . . . fight dirty !	Sonny Chiba shows up early giving the last rights to a guy on death row ? the ' last Okinawa karate master ' actually . He gives him the means to escape . Maybe he's a good guy . but I doubt it . Chiba just looks mean and ugly . He certainly isn't the Jet Li type . But , we soon find he is a thug-for-hire as the brother and sister show up and they are light in the cash they owe him . brother goes out the window and sister gets sold as a sex slave . This guy is so bad that he can walk out on the Yakusa . He will join any side that pays him more . What a sweetheart ! The film gets gorier and gorier from here . This is the first film in the US to get a X or violence , so expect to seem lots of blood . There are a lot of interesting characters , and lots of fighting , and lots of . . . well , I guess you can expect that from a street fighter .
432519	2171244	130121	7.0	Here , try this , " Hey , fuggeddabout it ! "	Hugh Grant is funny . He uses his British accent and his naughty schoolboy manner to bring a laugh to any film . This one is no exception . He falls in love with Gina ( Jeanne Tripplehorn ) , who's father ( James Caan ) is a mobster . So we have some of our favorite mobster characters : Burt Young ( " The Last Don " ) , Joe Viterelli ( Analyze This ) , Tony Darrow ( Small Time Crooks ) , Paul Lazar ( 29th Street ) , and . even " Big Pussy " from " The Sopranos " ( Vincent Pastore ) . Hugh Grant playing a mobster is a laugh a minute , and I just was captivated by Jeanne Tripplehorn ( Basic Instinct , The Firm ) . One of his best .
433288	2171244	493464	7.0	Wanted's Best Body Parts	Don't kid yourself . Nobody went to this film to see any of the actors listed before Angelina , and the studios knew it . Are there posters of trailers that feature James McAvoy ? Who is he anyway ? I saw one site that said they are thinking trilogy ; that he is the next Bourne . Give me a break ! McAvoy compared to Matt Damon . Unbelievable . What was the best feature of this movie ? Hands down , it is Angelina Jolie's lips . Director Timur Bekmambetov made sure that there were plenty of closeups of these luscious parts . Men melted in the aisles as they came to the screen Next , it was her warm green eyes . They just grab you and won't let go . Unfortunately for McAvoy , they can also trap you into doing things that are wrong . Angelina's trigger finger is not to be overlooked . She proves that she is a capable match for any bad guy and Willis or Thurman have nothing on her . McAvoy got a real closeup of Jolie's uterus when she was splayed on the hood . But only Shiloh Jolie-Pitt ? and whoever else is in there ? knows what it's really like . Lookie James , but no touchee . Everyone is focuses on Jolie's breast when their eyes stray from the lips . Not on full display in this film , but check out Taking Lives , Original Sin , and , of course , Gia for more information . It is Jolie's heart that captivates many , and she showed a little when she came to McAvoy's aid in shutting up his girlfriend . The World knows that heart well . Despite the 20 minute set up in this movie , we really can't focus on McAvoy . There is likely to be a sequel ( please , no trilogy ) and it will likely feature Jolie again . We can only hope .
433957	2171244	69897	7.0	She's a wild animal ! I've got to have that girl , George ! Tonight	This is real blaxploitation with breasts flying out of dresses everywhere . The biggest ones , of course , belong to Pam Grier , the Best of the Breast . Of course , there is also Lisa Farringer in her only nude scene that I am aware of in her too short 10 year career . There is a story here , too , as Coffy seeks to take revenge on all the dope-pushing scumbags that were responsible for her little sister getting hooked . A sawed-off shotgun to the face adds some action when breasts aren't flying . And , the wild costumes the pusher / pimps wore were are real hoot !
434290	2171244	35460	7.0	Hot for Hedy as a Potuguese beauty	It could only happen in Hollywood . They buy the rights to a Steinbeck novel about Mexicans and Portuguese in California and put all white actors in the cast . Now , maybe I can buy Hedy Lamarr as a Portuguese beauty , but Spenser Tracy and John Garfield as Mexicans ? Ludicrous casting , especially when the story is so ethnic . But , maybe it was genius as common stereotypes about Afro - and Mexican-Americans are played out in the form of Tracy , as a shiftless bum who mooches off his friends and manipulates them into providing him with wine and a roof over his head . Pilon ( Tracy ) is not interested in satisfying anything but his own belly and even goes after a poor wood-seller called The Pirate , in the form of Frank Morgan , who , in a Scorcese moment , got the Oscar nomination he should have gotten three years earlier for The Wizard of Oz . Lamarr was as beautiful as ever , and John Garfield did a great job as her pursuer , even as he had to avoid complete ruin from the machinations of Pilon .
434277	2171244	78437	7.0	I'm going to get you home .	Unlike Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust this film was not one of the infamous video nasties banned in Britain . It was like a test run for his famous film . It goes by the name Cannibal in the UK , and by the name The Last Survivor in the censored US version . This is the full film with all the gore and nudity . It is a beautifully shot film that will appeal to nature lovers . Birds , monkeys , snakes , crocodiles - they are all here . Of course , most of these animals end up as food after not-so-humane butchering . After watching some natives munching on their comrades , two of the survivors , Rolf ( Ivan Rassimov ) and Robert ( Massimo Foschi ) manage to build a raft and they get a nice ride down the rapids . But , they are soon back in the jungle , and this time the cannibals get Robert . They rip off his clothes and spend some time playing with his wienie . Here , we get to finally see Me Me Lai ( Eaten Alive , The Au Pair Girls , The Element Of Crime ) . She puts the other cannibals to shame with her beauty . After Robert manages to escape with Pulan ( Me Me Lai ) in tow , there is one scene too horrible to describe . Pulan escapes , and Robert catches her , rapes her , and she then starts bringing him food . Law of the jungle ? Poor Pulan was not to escape the jungle .
434009	2171244	424129	7.0	Only people who remember this is us	The one thing that strikes you more than anything else about the war documentary is how quiet it is . You would expect bombs exploding and bullets whizzing and shouts and screams , but they are all missing from this work by Petra Epperlein and Michael Tucker . What remains is a constant recognition of the tension under which these soldiers are operating . Every moment , 24 hours a day , they are under threat . Everey step they take , every road they travel is fraught with danger from IEDs or motors or rifle fire . They are America's young ; people who , for the most part , had no other options back home , and are now joined in a brotherhood that plays together , prays together , and dies together . It is a beautiful story of what our soldiers are going through .
434198	2171244	86984	7.0	I'd buy THAT for a dollar !	I am really not sure what to make of this film . Director Brian De Palma seemed to put together a mash-up that really goes all over the place and doesn't make too much sense , but I was stuck watching like a deer in the headlights . First off , Jake ( Craig Wasson ) is just plain stupid . I guess that is why his wife was cheating on him . Who meets someone for the first time and then takes a free apartment without wondering what the catch is ? And , can you really trust someone that looks like Sam ( Gregg Henry ) ? This Hitchcokian film noir has voyeurism , pornography , murder with a big drill , and a great performance by Melanie Griffith , who has more bad performances than Paris Hilton could ever dream of ( The Bonfire of the Vanities , Shining Through , Born Yesterday , Too Much , Mulholland Falls , Crazy in Alabama , and Cecil B . DeMented ) . De Palma's movies may not always be great art , but they sure are interesting .
432399	2171244	60214	7.0	Zombies that make you laugh	If you are looking for a zombie film , this will not satisfy you . Sure , it has zombies , but they are too busy devising double entendres and references to Abbott and Costello bits or other films to be gnawing on flesh . Speaking of flesh , Fenella Fielding was just about the hottest vampire I could imagine for the day . Her brother , played by Kenneth Williams , was a hoot . He played the gayest Dr Frankenstein character I ever saw . I had never seen Jim Dale before , and he was excellent . I only knew Dale as the reader of the Harry Potter books . I spent many hours with him as i listened to all of them many times over . Now , I find that he is an excellent actor to boot . If you like British comedy , and I certainly do , then this is one film you should see . I can't wait to see more of them .
433451	2171244	473308	7.0	As sweet as strawberry pie . Yum !	I couldn't get the song " Ya Never Know Just ' Oo You're Gonna Meet " out of my mind . You can hear it in Sherlock Holmes " Dressed to Kill , " but it basically says to always look your best because you never know . That is the thing that is so recurring throughout this film . You just never know who someone will find attractive , even if everyone else thinks they are mean , or a grouch , or whatever . That is , except for Jenna's husband , Earl ( Jeremy Sisto ) . The only song that fits him is Goodbye Earl by the Dixie Chicks . You can't really call this movie a comedy , but there were a few moments of mirth . It almost defies the description romantic , as the romance appeared tragic . I just call it a fun movie that makes you appreciate good acting and writing and directing . Keri Russell was fantastic . Andy Griffith was perfect . Adrienne Shelly , writer and director , is a tragic loss to movie making . It is probably not a movie that a guy should like , but I did , if nothing else to see all the wonderful pies . Yum !
434531	2171244	157503	7.0	Kirsten Dunst is a princess	Kirsten Dunst was the cutest thing in the black comedy about the pursuit of the American dream . Showing that fantasy and reality often mirror each other , one is reminded in this film of the Texas mother who hired a hit-man to go after the mom and her cheerleader daughter . Here , it is mom ( Kirstie Alley ) herself that uses murder to fix a beauty pageant for her daughter ( Denise Richards ) . The biggest laughs in this satire comes from Ellen Barkin , who played Durst's trailer-trash mom and mom's friend Loretta ( Allison Janney ) . They both had incredibly fake Minnesota accents . Adding to the laughs was the fact that just about everyone in this film smoke and drank constantly - not what you would expect at a teen pageant . Supporting was Sin City's Brittany Murphy and Matt Malloy as a sleazy judge . I know I will leave out some other fine performers as there were too many to mention . It was just a hoot and a thoroughly enjoyable movie about the business of pageants . Worth a look for Dunst and Richards alone .
434104	2171244	79073	7.0	I am the king of my kind .	John Badham directed Roy Schneider in the great Blue Thunder , and here he directs stage actor Frank Langella in a Gothic tale of horror . With Oscar-winner ( Hamlet ) and nine-time Oscar-nominee Laurence Olivier as Professor Van Helsing , this is a classic telling of Bram Stoker's tale that amuses and thrills . Oscar-nominated Kate Nelligan is the object of Count Dracula's desire . Langella is the master of the Dracula character , oozing sexual overtones throughout . With the color drained from the film , it has a creepiness that enhances the story . Of course , Dracula is too powerful here with garlic and crosses and silver bullets having no effect . It was , however , the first time I have seen communion wafer used . He lives !
433820	2171244	120841	7.0	Welcome to the Maternity Ward . . . from HELL .	OK , so it is not great art , but it sure was an interesting movie . I am not burdened with the fact of seeing this as a sequel , as I have not seen the original , so I can rate it on its own . There is little story line here . Aliens invade US through astronaut . Austronat breeds profusely to spead the species . Anti-hero hunts the astronaut with the aid of immune fellow astronaut . I like Michael Madsen and I thought he did a fair job . He was assisted by Mykelti Williamson , who has the sickle-cell trait , which is key to the movie . CSI's Marg Helgenberger does a James Woods ( John Carpenter's Vampires ) that could lead to a sequel . Natasha Henstridge , what can I say , just incredible . No Oscars for this movie , but definitely some golden globes : Nancy La Scala , Raquel Gardner , and Felicia Deel .
433918	2171244	75406	7.0	Shame on US	Despite the fact that this film had three Oscar nominations , and several Golden Globe nominations with one win ( Katharine Ross ) , and a boatload of stars , it is not worth watching so much for it's quality ( marginal ) but for the story of how we knew what was happening to the Jews before World War II and did little to stop it . This is the story of 937 Jews that were put on a boat to Havana with useless documents , as the German government had no intention of letting them off the ship . They were denied entry into Cuba , and the US also denied them entry before they finally were saved by a social service agency and allowed to land in Belgium . Of course , that would prove ultimately fatal for two-thirds of them as the war started just two months later . Why would Germany do this ? Simple . By sending a ship of Jews to the America's and having them turned away , they negated any right the US would have to complain when they started exterminating Jews . Clever of them , and our government fell right into their trap . Our support for Israel is not so much that we love the Jews , but a massive guilt for our participation in their extermination . There were some great performances in this otherwise mediocre film : Lee Grant and Katherine Ross ; some good performances : Ben Gazzara , Faye Dunaway ; and the film debut of Jonathan Pryce ( POTC 1 . 2 . & 3 , Tomorrow Never Dies ) . Check it out .
432229	2171244	389722	7.0	I'm done playing with this one . You want to play with me now ?	I expected some really dark film , but was surprised that the lighting throughout was perfect . The cinematography was also superb , with magnificent shots of the frozen landscape and the sun rising and setting . The story was fantastic with Stuart Beattie ( Shutter , P . O . T . C ) and Brian Nelson ( Hard candy ) joining Steve Niles in adapting his comic for the screen . Josh Hartnett ( Lucky Number Slevin ) and Melissa George ( " Alias " ) were very good in the leads and made this movie a joy to watch . They had some great support from an interesting cast that included Ben Foster ( 3 : 10 to Yuma ) and some really horrible-looking vampires . The makeup was really beautiful and the teeth were terrifying . A really great vampire movie .
434459	2171244	73802	8.0	I don't remember yesterday . Today it rained .	This is one of Robert Redford's best films . It is the one I remember most when thinking of Redford . All of the glory went to Faye Dunaway and Max von Sydow however . That is not to say that they didn't put in fine performances , but Redford's was superior and I cannot understand how he was ignored . Remembering Sydney Pollack , who died last month , this is also one of his best films , and one of several he did with Redford . Cliff Robertson was also good , and I always like to see the late John Houseman . who I will always remember as Professor Charles W . Kingsfield Jr . If you like tight suspense thriller , then this is a great one , and the message in 1975 is ever so poignant today .
434626	2171244	629301	8.0	I'd skip the procedure if he orders the chili .	A classic with Lennie Briscoe ( Jerry Orbach ) and Ed Green ( Jesse L . Martin ) , and the best A . D . A . they ever had on the show , Serena Southerlyn ( Elisabeth Röhm ) . Alexis Dziena ( Broken Flowers , Stone Cold ) was magnificent as the sister to a dead model . Jonathan Hogan , who has been on " Law & Order " four times , and is probably the only guest to be on all four of the " Law & Order " series ( Trial by Jury , Criminal Intent , Special Victims Unit ) was the doctor they pursued for the models killing . he was represented by another favorite , Michael Boatman ( " Spin City " , " Arli$$ " ) . Jack loses this one due to an unforeseen twist at the end .
434282	2171244	39152	8.0	I thought you weren't allowed to work on Sunday .	The John Wayne Marathon has reached the halfway point - 17 hours of The Dukes action . This is a real departure as Wayne is being ensnared by a Quaker girl ( Gail Russell ) . he struggles to give up his past and there are many pitfalls along the way to a dramatic conclusion when he makes a choice . Harry Carey joins the Duke again ; this time as a territorial Marshall who seems to keep turning up hoping to catch him in a bad deed so he can hang him . He plays a significant role in the choice Wayne makes when the girls is apparently on her deathbed . Excellent movie about the good / bad dilemma .
433593	2171244	221344	8.0	Either you fck them or you get fcked .	An excellent hidden gem from writer / director Luis Estrada that won over 20 awards . The Mayor of San Pedro loses his head while trying to abscond with the town's money , so the party puts in a figurehead ( Damián , - Crónicas , The Crime of Father Amaro ) until the elections . Soon , he figures out the way of politics and is enjoying the benefits - and they are hot benefits ! Soon , he is killing his enemies and extorting money like the rest of them . Of course , he manages to rise through his evil as all politicians do . Alcázar was outstanding in this political satire , as was Salvador Sánchez , Guillermo Gil , and Isela Vega .
434622	2171244	629386	8.0	Don't you care about the people you killed ?	I always like the shows with Lenny Briscoe ( Jerry Orbach ) . He manages to come up with the most sarcastic quips in his investigations . There are two themes running through this episode . First the diagnosis of schizophrenia and the fact that many with that disease do not take their medication regularly . Secondly , the overwhelming amount of cases handles by a District Attorney's office and the necessity to plead out to keep the courts from being clogged . That is what led the defendant , James Smith , played admirably by Denis O'Hare ( Michael Clayton , A Mighty Heart ) to be on the streets . Jack ( Sam Waterston ) and Claire ( Jill Hennessy ) manage to get justice done despite the efforts of the D . A . Adam Schiff ( Steven Hill ) to just make it all go away .
433156	2171244	369060	8.0	Evil prevails . Only the good die young .	Naturally , sequels are not usually as good as the original . The technically isn't a sequel , but a prequel , giving us a taste of what came before . It is mainly concerned with SP Wong ( Anthony Wong ) and Sam ( Eric Tsang ) . They are much more friendly in this film - before they both get killed in Infernal Affairs . The original actors are replaced . Yan is Shawn Yue instead of Tony Leung , and Lau is Edison Chen instead of Andy Lau . It doesn't matter as they are minor characters in this movie . Francis Ng does a great job of the bosses son , and Carina Lau as Mary , who is in all three movies is superb as well . Kai Chi Liu as Uncle John and Chapman To also turn in good performances . Of course the music was just incredible !
434287	2171244	66301	8.0	Don't you worry Ketcham : You're gonna be the first to die !	Still hanging in there as we go into the second day of the John Wayne Marathon . This is not one of the best , but it was pretty good . The dialog left a lot to be desired , but it had some interesting characters . Besides Wayne , who was a Yankee Colonel who was looking for two traitors ( Victor French & Robert Donner ) after the war , there was Jorge Rivero and Robert Mitchum's son Christopher , who both fought on the Confederate side and who helped Wayne find the traitors after the war . Jack Elam was there and also George Plimpton , who played in many movies like Good Will Hunting and Reds , and who wrote " Infamous . " Jennifer O'Neill , Susana Dosamantes , and Sherry Lansing all added beauty to the film .
434429	2171244	386342	8.0	War is hell !	I've been there . I've had the training . I know what you are supposed to do . But sometimes life happens when you are looking the other way . Two brothers - one a criminal and the other a soldier ; one a respected member of society , and the other the shame of his family ; one just out of prison , and the other off to Afghanistan . Writer / director Susanne Bier presents a compelling drama that examines how people react to stress , and how people can suddenly change when circumstances call for it . It was beautifully shot , it has a compelling score , and it had one of the most beautiful actresses of our time in Connie Nielsen . Nielsen was incredible as the wife of the soldier ( Ulrich Thomsen ) , trying to keep things together when he was reported dead . She had to show even greater strength when he returned damaged by the war . In the middle was the younger brother ( Nikolaj Lie Kaas ) who stepped in to help with Michael's two daughters . The story of this family and how they dealt with tragedy was compelling . Anyone who has a family member come back from war can relate . It is not to be missed .
432233	2171244	776794	8.0	Maybe we should study the Amish	This is the hard truth . Not some political statement , but real scientists and oil historians explaining the history of oil and where we are heading . It does not go down easy . If you think it will last forever , then you would be in the company of Texans , Russians and Venezuelans that thought their fields would last forever and now sit on barren land . There is only so much underground and we know where all of it is . If you think " Blood for Oil " is just an anti-war slogan , you will be surprised that the major conflicts going on right now - Darfur and Iraq - are about oil , not religion or ethnic issues . You must also be prepared for the fact that we will have continuous war in the future to keep SUVs on the road . If you think that all the alternatives to oil that have been proposed will solve the problem , then you really need to find out just what we can expect . It will surprise you , I'm sure . Look at the Amish and how they live . That is our future . If you think otherwise , you really need to put this film in your queue .
434633	2171244	52311	8.0	Your future is all used up .	I had no intention of watching this movie . I actually tuned into a Chinese movie of the same name , but the station screwed up and put this one on instead . I am actually glad they did as it is an outstanding example of a B movie . It had everything you would look for in a B classic : Charleton Heston playing the part of a Mexican cop . How truly unbelievable ! He did it the year before Ben Hur . He was actually in five films that year . He really cranked them out . The film was written and directed by the great Orsen Welles , who also played the bad police captain . He did it all : framing suspects , slandering with talk of drug use to get Heston off his back , setting up Heston't wife ( Janet Leigh ) for murder , and even killing his best friend ( Joseph Calleia ) , who loved him as Marlene Dietrich told us . A superb classic that really had it all , even Zsa Zsa Gabor and Ray Collins , who I remember from Perry Mason as Lt . Trask , and , a special bonus , my cousin , Dennis Weaver in a really odd role as the hotel night clerk . This was a classic in every sense of the word .
432321	2171244	1157620	8.0	43 + years ago - different war , different president ; different times - same problems , nothing changes .	Can aging rockers renew their spirit and use their music to ignite America in a different war . From the song " Ohio " after Kent State , they travel across America with new music and a new war . Mike Cerre , who chronicled Vietnam and was embedded in Iraq travels with the band to report what happens . The title of this documentary is perfect as we have been here before and here we are again in the same mess as another president tries to show his manhood . But , can change occur if enough people rally in support of bringing our boys home ? It is doubtful , and you risk pissing a lot of people off . Good documentary showing the feeling of people over this war and the music of CSNY .
432852	2171244	629641	8.0	We al have our devils to fight .	All the usual cast of Law & Order Special Victims Unit with the addition of Robert Patrick . Patrick is someone who can play a sleaze-bag to perfection . He was spectacular as the robot in Terminator 2 : Judgement Day , magnificent in The Marine , and perfect in First To Die . He has been in many films and always comes through . He was fantastic in this role as a rapist , not for his crimes , but how he played against Christopher Meloni . Using his compulsion as a rapist he could easily get inside Meloni's head because he also has a compulsion . He is a character that explodes easily , and Patrick's character knew it . This is one of my favorite episodes of the show because of these two characters and the two actors who made them so believable .
432906	2171244	43456	8.0	Klaatu barada nikto !	The most amazing thing about this film was not Klaatu's ( Michael Rennie ) ability to completely stop all action on Earth for 30 minutes , but the fact that Bobby ( Billy Gray ) wore a tie . Can you imagine some kid doing that today ! Seriously , this was an excellent film that promoted peace and understanding among all nations by attempting to demonstrate the common good and the need for international cooperation . Unfortunately , we have still failed to heed the warning over 50 years later and still act like Tom Stevens ( Hugh Marlowe ) , concerned for our own self-interest . Oscar winner Patricia Neal ( Hud , The Subject Was Roses ) gave a powerful performance as Bobby's mother and a " real " secretary . If you haven't seen it , you should just to hear the final message .
433686	2171244	364656	8.0	Noir is dead ; long live neo-noir	Film Noir has not existed since the sixties , but filmmakers are incorporating the aspects of the genre into new films . Examples include Fargo , Se7en , L . A . Confidential , Pulp Fiction , The Usual Suspects , Memento , Reservoir Dogs , and Sin City . Canadian Gary Yates has written and directed a film that reminds us of the old days with the low lights and hard criminals , but in a comedy of cons conning cons . It may take a scorecard to figure out who is conning who , but viewers will be thrilled with the ending . Kevin Pollack ( The Usual Suspects ) and Liane Balaban lead this quirky and enjoyable film with a great supporting cast that will keep you guessing .
432434	2171244	862812	8.0	A slice of life in New York	Being a fan of Julia Stiles ( The Bourne trilogy , The Omen , The Business of Strangers ) , I was curious to see her first effort at writing and directing . I was not disappointed . Bill Irwin ( Across the Universe ) and Zooey Deschanel ( Bridge to Terabithia , The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford ) were both fascinating as flawed individuals whose past is a shadow to us , and who chance encounter brings about profound changes .

432352	2171244	4972	8.0	Dare we dream of a golden day when the bestial War shall rule no more .	It was an epic when it was made , and still a work of art in cinema history . The first part show the " gentile " South and the war . It was romanticized to the extent that brother was fighting brother , friend was fighting friend , and in meeting during the war , they remained friends . Nice , but probably not accurate . Still , it made for a good story . The second half is filled with controversy as the Carpetbaggers invade the South and establish Black rule that is designed to crush the Whites until the Golden Knights of the Ku Klux Klan save society to live in peace . This is the story as presented , not an interpretation . Despite the historical inaccuracy , it it still a magnificent work with amazing performances by Lillian Gish , Mae Marsh , Henry B . Walthall , George Siegmann , and others . It is hard to believe that words are not needed to display feelings .
433937	2171244	236640	8.0	Great performance by Ricci	I really really really want to see Christina Ricci in Black Snake Moan , but I was embarrassed to go buy a ticket for that movie , so I watched this instead . I probably saw more of Christina that I would have seen in the other movie anyway . I have to say that she was really incredible and entirely believable as someone who is going through depression , and trying to get off the pills , but finally coming to the realization that you will probably never get rid of them totally . Anyone who sees this movie should have some idea of what depressed people go through . The self-doubts and the irrational reactions to simple things and the suicidal ideation are just three items they have to deal with . I also liked Jessica Lange as her mom . A totally great followup to her performance in Blue Sky . And , hey , I haven't seen Michelle Williams since Brokeback Mountain . Great job as the roommate . Didn't care at all for the rest of the cast . Watching pie-boy doesn't interest me . I would totally be back in therapy for the long haul if Anne Heche was my therapist . I can see some major transference issues here .
432437	2171244	435625	8.0	Hey , there's something down here . . .	If there was ever the remotest chance that I would ever go into a cave , that chance just became non existent after seeing this film . Girls may want to have fun , but these girls - Shauna Macdonald , Natalie Jackson Mendoza , Alex Reid , Saskia Mulder , MyAnna Buring ( Grindhouse ) , and Nora-Jane No one - are starkers ! I'm all for a little adventure , but this was more than my heart can take . Hell , it was almost too much just watching it . If you want to get scared shitless , then you have to see this film . Makeup was incredible and there were some great performance in an adrenaline-pumping exercise in terror .
434075	2171244	26029	8.0	I know what it is to feel lonely and helpless and to have the whole world against me ,	I decided to visits a couple of classics last night and I started with the British Hitchcock movie . It was a few years after this film that he came to the United States , A career that spanned 50 years and some very fine films . This film reminded me of The Fugative . The basic premises are similar . A man is on the run after being accused of a murder he did not commit . He wasn't looking for a one-armed man , but for a spy . Of course , no one believed him and he stayed just a half-step ahead of the law . The climax is a little contrived , but Robert Donat ( Goodbye , Mr . Chips ) made a dashing fugitive , and Madeleine Carroll as the typical Hitchcock blond added humor to the film . A good introduction to the master of suspense .
433236	2171244	60277	8.0	The sword is the soul . Study the soul to know the sword . Evil mind , evil sword .	This was Tatsuya Nakadai's film . He was an evil samurai ( Ryunosuke Tsukue ) that would kill at the drop of a hat . Toshirô Mifune as Toranosuke Shimada had only a small role in the film , but Ryunosuke managed to see him in action and knew not to mess with him . Ryunosuke killed Hyoma's ( Yuzo Kayama ) brother after sleeping with his wife . Hyoma was away at school at the time . He went after Ryunosuke , but the movie ended before he had a chance . It had the kind of ending that was used in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid . After killing a couple of dozen samurai , Ryunosuke was still fighting , although badly wounded , at the end . Did he make it ? I guess director Kihachi Okamoto wants us to guess if there will be a sequel . The film was typically a very beautifully filmed Japanese artwork , and it seemed to have a lot more blood that I would expect for a film in 1966 .
434503	2171244	377800	8.0	Where is Howard ? Who is Howard ?	On thing you can be certain of when you watch a Wim Wenders ( Buena Vista Social Club , Paris , Texas , The End of Violence ) is stunning cinematography , a great soundtrack , and an emotional story . Franz Lustig's cinematography in Montana , Utah and Nevada was breathtaking . The shot inside the casino was surreal . I could watch the film with the sound off just to see the pictures . The soundtrack by Bono and T-Bone Burnett was thrilling . Wenders always has great music in his films . Then there is the story . I know exactly what Sam Shepard was feeling . Jessica Lange was super , as she always is . Sarah Polley was a thrill and really made the story . Fairuza Balk was an interesting character that I want to see again . I just like Wim Wenders and he did a great job with this Sam Shepard story .
434317	2171244	144201	8.0	What is love ?	Daniel Auteuil ( Caché ) and Vanessa Paradis certainly give us a good answer to that question . She is ready to jump off a bridge when he comes to save her and convince her that , if she is going to kill herself anyway , she might as well be his target in a knife-throwing act . But , her luck changes when she learns to trust him and give herself to him . She has a need to sleep with anyone she fancies , but not with him . Their intercourse is in the act , and you can can see the passion on her face as he uses his knives as a means of penetration . Well , not penetration of her , as that would be messy . Auteuil was extremely funny with a script by Serge Frydman . The direction of Patrice Leconte ensured that the film's 90 minutes packed the wallop of a 3 hr film , and cinematography by Jean-Marie Dreujou gave this black and white film a magic that was captivating . Love ? It's trust and concern and belief in your partner .
432423	2171244	71275	8.0	There are two versions of this film	This film sat in a can for 23 years due to the death of the financier and it being tied up in his estate . There are two versions . Bava's original , " Rabid Dogs , " is grittier and more unpolished . His son redid it as " Kidnapped , " adding scenes and Americanizing the dialog a bit . One goof was the thief's comment about getting " the chair . " You can't get the chair in Italy , only in more uncivilized countries . Like " Reservoir Dogs , " this film is all about what happens after the robbery ; and , like " The Sugarland Express , " almost all of the action takes place inside of a car - well , three actually . There is really a lot going on with two really crazy thieves , and the leader trying to keep things together until they escape . And , the ending will blow your mind !
432172	2171244	165929	8.0	In memory of Aaliyah	It was four years ago on August 25 that Aaliyah was tragically taken from us and the life of another great musical talent cut short . I decided to watch Romeo Must Die with Jet Li in her memory as it has a lot of her music ( Come Back in One Piece " , " I Don't Wanna " , " Try Again " and " Are You Feelin ' Me ? " ) , and it is one great movie that I watch over and over again . DMX was also in the movie and he joined Jet Li again in Cradle 2the Grave , another movie with great action and great music . Thanks , Aaliyah , for the music you gave us . I never get tired of watching Jet Li in action and look forward to many more movies with him .
432786	2171244	82776	8.0	Rape and revenge	Looking like a schoolgirl ( probably intentional ) as she was reportedly only 17 when they made this film , and mute , Thana ( Zoë Lund ) is the perfect victim . After two rapes , she manages to find the strength to kill her second rapist and proceeds to dispose of him . She disposes of the body parts from her rapist in some very innovative ways . It gets funny . There is not the rage of Death Wish , but terrifying flashbacks and slow transformation into a killing machine . She starts to really get into her role . We get a bit of nunsploitation when she goes to a party as Sister Thana . I never had any nuns in school that dressed like her ! Things really got fired up at the party . One can argue that a man got her in the end . Look for the symbolism . A great revenge movie .
434527	2171244	438327	8.0	An accident , speculation , and looming disaster	It seems appropriate as houses are falling in value all over due to sub-prime loans and speculation to look at another area that fell victim . The Salton Sea was formed by the Colorado River to create Imperial Valley . In the Fifties , it was a resort area with great Tilapia fishing , boating , swimming , skiing , etc . But two big storms in the Seventies flooded the are , and they have been plagued with other problems , and all the speculation is gone . Now , there is a community of very interesting individuals : a seventy-year-old man who stands completely naked by the highway , an artist who is creating some kind of holy mountain , lots of minorities that have escaped the dangers of LA , and older whites who have been there from the beginning . If you can stand a die off of 7 million fish or bird botulism , it really looks like a place to escape to . In any case , it is another unique part of American that most people have never heard of .
434613	2171244	497465	9.0	The trick is to enjoy life , accepting it has no meaning whatsoever .	I recall seeing a Woody Allen film before . I believe it was Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask . I don't really recall it , and it was so long ago . If this film is a typical Woody Allen film , then I have been cheating myself out of great pleasure for a long time . Rebecca Hall , Scarlett Johansson , Javier Bardem , Patricia Clarkson , and Penélope Cruz were all fascinating , especially Cruz , not to diminish the fine performances from all of them . The story was amazing . I was mesmerized for the entire 96 minutes . I could not miss one word of the dialog . The direction was perfect and it was definitely one of the best films of 2008 . And , did I mention that Penélope Cruz deserved her Oscar and every other award she got for this role ?
433407	2171244	48021	9.0	You're not the only one that had an unhappy childhood , there are millions like you , and , in my eyes , they are the tough ones , not you !	I heard they were going to remake this French classic in 2007 , and I see it is in development for 2011 . This will be a shame , as Hollywood kicked writer / director Jules Dassin out because of the infamous blacklist . They should not have the right to remake any of his films . I love " caper " films and " film noir , " and this combines the best of both . Tony ( Jean Servais ) gets out after doing a nickle , and after he beats up his old girlfriend ( Marie Sabouret ) , he plans a big score with his friends Mario ( Robert Manuel ) and Jo ( Carl Möhner ) , What makes this a great caper flick is the attention to detail in planning the robbery . You see that reflected in the George Clooney Vegas capers . Nothing is left to chance . The caper goes off great but Grutter ( Marcel Lupovici ) sends his sons , Robert Hossein and Pierre Grasset after Tony and the gang . After blowing it with Mario , they kidnap Jo's son . Lots of bullets fly before it is over . A great film by a great director . The standard by which other caper films are measured .
434160	2171244	451094	9.0	Be White . Live White . Like this .	Why ? Why in the world would Danny Boyle think for one second about remaking this film . It is a classic with Yeong-ae Lee as the star , and Chan-wook Park as the director . I am so tired of Hollywood stealing great Asian movies to remake them with so-called stars that can't come close to the originals - Infernal Affairs and Il Mare , to name two . Yeong-ae Lee was brilliant as she plotted her vengeance and I have to say that I was blown away . The prison scenes were funny and so perfect . Well , maybe their could have been a shower scene . I was so expecting her revenge to be so predictable . The last half hour of this film is just simply brilliant . Park and Seo-Gyeong Jeong wrote a masterpiece . No , it would not be better with a Hostel finish . It was perfect as it was . It was art instead of torture-porn . How could you possibly improve on this ? Stay away from this , Hollywood . It doesn't need you .
432729	2171244	52357	9.0	One final thing I have to do . . . and then I'll be free of the past .	Oscar ignored this fantastic film by Hitchcock starring James Stewart . It gave nomination for Art and Set decoration and Sound . Small acknowledgment of an outstanding film . James Stewart was outstanding as a detective that was duped by his " friend ( Tom Helmore ) . " We were all led on an adventure that made absolutely no sense until we were shown the result . This film really had me going ! Kim Novak was also excellent in her role as the wife . She was so good that I had no idea that she was anything more than object of Stewart's obsession . Hitchcock had me going her also . This was an excellent movie and should have had more recognition .
434026	2171244	443274	9.0	What is truth ?	Whew ! This has to be the most exciting film I have seen this year . The heart-stopping action doesn't stop and you are sitting on the edge of you seat wondering what is happening . This is actually the same story - the same 15 minutes - told from the perspective of different people . Just when you think you may know what is happening , you go to a different perspective and you have to change your thinking . You may think that you are watching the same thing over and over , but there are subtle differences in each viewing depending on who the focus is on . The direction by Pete Travis in Barry Levy's script was flawless . The casting was stupendous . Dennis Quaid as a secret service agent back on the job after a tragedy , a la Clint Eastwood in In The Line of Fire was brilliant . Quaid gave a first rate performance as a focused agent with deep emotional problems . He was a joy to watch . But , he wasn't the only joy . Forest Whitaker was stupendous as an American tourist who gets in the middle of things . He was not the hero type , but he came through in a magnificent performance . Ayelet Zurer ( Munich ) was a fascination to watch ; Sigourney Weaver was amazing as a hardened news-person who showed her humanity at just the right time ; William Hurt as the President had gravitas to be sure , and his role has to be viewed to be appreciated ; and Eduardo Noriega will go to the top of my list of actors to look for in the future . He was perfect for his part . Those who think that truth is an absolute need to see this film . It should be required for the first day of every history class to let students know that there are always different perspectives on history . Prosecuting attorneys may want to add this to voir doir , because if you have seen it , you will not be likely to take just one opinion for anything . Finally , the car chase through Mexico City has to be the greatest of all time . Bullitt can't touch it !
434130	2171244	140352	9.0	The Big Lie	Jeffrey Wigand ( Russel Crowe ) put it all on the line : his family , he reputation , his career , and his life . He had a story to tell about the addictive properties of tobacco and it was eating at him until he got it out . Lowell Bergman ( Al Pacino ) of CBS News went to bat and did everything in his power to get his story out . He ended up walking away from his job also in the effort . The story made it out and Big Tobacco paid billions in the familiar tobacco settlements . This is the story of the man who brought them down . The acting was brilliant and the directing was masterful . Crowe , director Michael Mann and The Insider were all beat out in the 2000 Academy Awards by American Beauty . What a shame as this was clearly the superior film .
433635	2171244	470705	9.0	I am the super mother bug !	This film fits right in with Polanski's Repulsion . Those looking for typical horror will be disappointed with both films . This is the slow psychological horror that takes some effort to appreciate . Ashley Judd ( De-Lovely , Norma Jean & Marilyn ) plays a trailer-trash bi-sexual ; hooked on meth and at the mercy of an abusive ex ( Harry Connick Jr . ) . Looking for love , she lets Peter ( Michael Shannon - Revolutionary Road ) , a paranoid schizophrenic into her life . Director William Friedkin ( The Exorcist , The French Connection ) doesn't hit you over the head with the facts . He leaves clues to pick up on and lets you put together what is happening . As Judd gets further into Shannon's delusion , it becomes real to her and she even turns on her friends . It isn't long before the tinfoil comes out . Then comes Dr . Sweet ( Brian F . O'Byrne ) , and things really get exciting . He uses her delusion to gain her trust , but he didn't count on Peter totally flipping out . What an ending ! What a magnificent performance by Judd .
433896	2171244	53221	9.0	You want that gun , pick it up . I wish you would .	If you are looking for top action , you can't go wrong here . Howard Hawks directs John Wayne and Dean Martin in one of the most enjoyably westerns ever made . Quenton Tarantino reported has said , " When I am getting serious about a girls , I show her Rio Bravo . And she better fcking like it . " Wayne projected a balance of swagger and shrewdness , compassion and professionalism as he portrayed a " Real American , " some say as a sop to Congress and The House Un-American Activities Committee . As support for the he-man Wayne , Hawks used Dean Martin , Walter Brennan , and Angie Dickinson . He also cast pre-Roscoe P . Coltane Claude Akins as the villain . He also threw Ozzie and Harriett's son Ricky , into the mix presumably to generate teen interest . Looking for real manly-man cowboys , you'll find it here .
432522	2171244	86979	9.0	That's the test , ain't it ? Test of true love .	I love Frances McDormand . Every movie she is in is great . This was her first and it is great also . Simple enough ? Well , I can't make it any simpler . This is a Coen brother noir , and it is their first film also . Joel and Ethan have done some marvelous work ( Fargo , O Brother , Where Art Thou ? , Intolerable Cruelty ) and I am looking forward to their next ( No Country for Old Men ) . You know what has happened , but the characters are all in the dark . It is interesting to see what they do when they haven't a clue . It is a mix of merciless violence and black comedy . No one could have seen this film when it came out and not know that we would have many more great ones from the Coen Brothers .
433388	2171244	90605	9.0	They're coming outta the walls . They're coming outta the goddamn walls , we're fcked !	Again , it would take me all night to talk about the awards this film won and was nominated for . Suffice it to say that James Cameron directed a masterpiece of sci-fi horror . Although she didn't wear those skimpy panties that showed some ass cleavage in Alien , Sigourney Weaver was just as hot in her grey underwear and she kicked some major butt in this film . I was initially turned off with all the military hoorah that was going on in the beginning , but the film turned out to be even better than the first . There was some real horror to go along with major suspense and , even though I had to go so bad I almost wet myself , I could not tear myself away for the last 20 minutes . It was fucking awesome ! Lance Henriksen was also great , and i look forward to seeing more of him . You know I will be looking for Alien 3 and 4 !
434539	2171244	51378	9.0	Outstanding Film Noir	I tried to watch Jeanne Moreau in François Truffaut's Jules and Jim the same day I saw this . I really tried and , despite the fact that it was the best Europen film of 1963 and Truffaut won a couple of awards for directing it , I couldn't make it more that a half hour . It was just plain boring . Not so with this film noir classic . Jeanne Moreau was simply captivating as a woman who was having an affair and could not figure out what went wrong with the murder of her husband and why her lover played by Maurice Ronet ( The Scandal ) was driving away with another woman . What she didn't know was that he was actually trapped in an elevator and his car was stolen by some young kids . What happens to the kids and the effect on the adulterous couple was totally captivating . This was film noir at its best and director Louis Malle gave us a classic worth watching again and again .
434097	2171244	75314	9.0	De Niro was outstanding !	I actually saw this for the first time this morning . I couldn't sleep and it was on at 4am . It was every bit as good as I was led to believe . Comparing the two , I cannot see how this lost to Rocky at the Academy Awards . Scorsese fans will also agree that he deserved a directing award for this film . While De Niro and Foster were fantastic , I feel that Cybill Shepherd was equally good , and should have been recognized for her performance . This film won 18 awards out of 27 nominations . Basically only the Academy didn't get on the bandwagon . But , in all those nominations , none for Sheperd . I really think that was wrong . Great film , and I will watch it again and again .
433102	2171244	110413	9.0	Cleaners need love , too	It is easy to praise the father-daughter relationship that Leon ( Jean Reno ) and Mathilda ( Natalie Portman ) display in this dark and compelling film , but I feel that would be superficial . The relationship appeared to be much deeper - almost sexual - as the two tried to find some meaning in their lives . Leon was just slouching through life doing his job and not caring about much else . A wired cop ( Gary Oldman ) thrust Mathilda into his arms , and he became her protector and trainer . This relationship unfolded slowly and beautifully and was truly a joy to watch . Sure , there was action , but it framed the story , which was really about Leon and Mathilda . Reno and Portman were brilliant and aptly supported by Oldman and Danny Aiello .
434235	2171244	385726	9.0	It's a long and winding road to Glory	I was discussing affirmative action the other day and encountered the usual argument about those things that happened in our great grandfather's day . Having grown up in the South , I am well aware that many of the things that happened in " my " day are still going on to some extent . I was high enough up the food chain in the military to hear conversations behind closed doors . In the small Arkansas town I grew up in , blacks lived across the tracks and up the hill - they probably still do . A . O . Scott comments in the New York Times about Glory Road : " Glory Road finds its true story at a point where sports history intersects with the struggle for racial equality . The annals of postwar America are full of such moments , but few of them are as astonishing and consequential as the 1966 N . C . A . A . championship game , in which Don Haskins , coach of the Miners of Texas Western ( now known as the University of Texas at El Paso ) , sent five black players onto the floor against Adolph Rupp's all-white University of Kentucky team . " Forget about Josh Lucas , Tatyana Ali , Emily Deschanel , or Jon Voight . They were incidental to the film and could have easily been replaced with others . The story of the Texas Western basketball players in 1966 is what Glory Road is all about . It happened in 1966 . I was a sophomore in High School . I knew no more about Civil Rights or black oppression that the next guy . The only thing I knew for sure was that we used a two-handed set shot , not jumpers or Michael Jordan moves . It's the same criticism that I have of Hoosiers , another great basketball film . It wasn't my great grandfather's day ; it was mine . It still is . If you are not moved by this film , then you are part of what was wrong then and what is not corrected to this day . It was about respect and the need for humans to give each other their due and not dwell on stupidity . We were all cut from the same cloth many many generations ago in Africa . I came to Florida from West Texas and know the area well . Color is not important there when it comes to sports . We've gotten past that . It is time to get past it in other areas of our lives . If Glory Road can help a little bit in that , then it is well worth your time . Well , it's well worth your time anyway as it is a great movie . As Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post said : It's one helluva story , and if this moving , and even thrilling little movie finally brings Haskins and a truly great American sports story to light , then three cheers and hooray .
433161	2171244	338564	10.0	I'll dream of you , Officer Yan .	One cannot relate all the superlatives of this film without the risk of missing something . This is the film " The Departed " wanted to be when they tried to duplicate it - - they didn't come close . Felix Chong and Siu Fai Mak wrote this incredible story of and undercover cop in the mob , and an undercover mobster on the police force ( Andy Lau ) . Directors Wai Keung Lau and Siu Fai Mak ( again ) did not waste one second of the hour and a half that this story runs . The sound was superlative . The art direction , cinematography , music , visual effects and editing were top notch , and the action choreography was the equal of any Chinese action film - just breathtaking ! And then there is Tony Leung ( Jet Li's Hero , Hard Boiled ) as Yan and Anthony Wong as SP Wong . What could you possibly say that hasn't been said in the over 100 reviews of their performances ? If you liked The Departed , then check out the original . You will not be disappointed .
432789	2171244	78788	10.0	Oh man , the sht piled up so fast in Vietnam you needed wings to stay above it .	This film deserved every single award it got , and deserved some that it didn't get . The winners for Best Picture and Best Director and best supporting Actor paled in comparison to this film and Driector Francis Ford Coppola , and Robert Duvall's portrayal as Lt Col Kilgore . Duvall's performance was just one of some really great performances in this film . Martin Sheen held it all together ; a young Laurence Fishburne , Albert Hall , Aurore Clément in her prime , Dennis Hopper , so many more that it is hard to mention them . Naturally , we have to mention the absolutely brilliant performance of Marlon Brando . The music and cinematography were first rate , worthy of the many accolades they received . " The Ride of the Valkyries " will forever be associated with this film . The stunt work was also superb . Every aspect of this film stands out as a classic right up there with Gone With the Wind .
432153	2171244	43014	10.0	I am big . It's the pictures that got small .	Released the same year that I was , this magnificent film ( # 16 on AFI's 2007 Top-100 Movies ) was the greatest of Billy Wilder's many achievements . Wilder enraged the big-wigs in Hollywood with his film . It would probably won many more Oscars had the voters been honest and not let their hurt feelings get in the way . Gloria Swanson was magnificent as a silent film star wanting to return to movies . The fact that she was a real silent film star made it all the more incredible . She dominated the screen every time she appeared . Her co-star , William Holden ( Stalag 17 , Network ) , was equally brilliant as a hack screenwriter who allowed himself to be kept by Swanson . The sets and music were beyond compare . The cinematography was brilliant . Actor / Director Erich von Stroheim played the butler flawlessly . This was only Nancy Olsen's third film , and she played Betty like a veteran . There have been so many great things written about this film , that I can only sound like a parrot , but to see Wilder at his best and some of Hollywood's greats from the silent and contract period , this film is a must .
432154	2171244	109831	10.0	My all-time favorite	There is no movie that I enjoy watching over and over . This is absolutely the best film of Hugh Grant's career . Andie MacDowell is stupendous as his American Love interest . These two belong together like butter and jam on toast . There were so many great performances in this film that it is hard to point out anyone without offending another or going on all day . Rowan Atkinson was simply marvelous as a priest . Auden's poem . read at the funeral , had me in tears . This film was such a celebration of life that even death was remembered fondly . I just cannot imagine that anyone would not find this film as funny as I did .
432694	2171244	389557	10.0	An exciting tale of espionage	When I think of a Paul Verhoeven film , I think of excitement - Total Recall , Flesh+Blood , Robocop , etc . He hits another home run with this tale of the Dutch resistance against the Nazis and the sacrifice made by one woman ( Carice van Houten ) to avenge the death of her family . Van Houten , who we will see again as Tom Cruise's wife in Valkyrie ( although we will certainly not see her to the extent that we saw here here ) , was magnificent and really made this picture . There was a superb cast of supporting characters that made Gerard Soeteman's and Verhoeven's story come alive on the screen . Nobody stand out like Van Houten , and she made this one of the best film experiences of the year .
432164	2171244	293508	10.0	A visual and auditory feast !	I hadn't watched The Phantom of the Opera even though it had been on my shelf since the day it was released on DVD . I bought it for my wife because she was in love with Andrew Lloyd Webber's music . I think she was more in love with the Michael Crawford CD . She can dream of Michael Crawford as long as she doesn't mind me dreaming of Halle Berry . I like Webber's music also , especially Evita and the end title song from Notting Hill , but I was not prepared for the visual and auditory feast that was The Phantom of the Opera . The sets were magnificent , especially the graveyard and the catacombs , which seemed to go on forever . The singing by Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum was incredible ! And Rossum's beauty was a real feast for the eyes , as was Jennifer Ellison . This is a love story for the ages and I anticipate watching and listening to it many times . In fact , there is a 2-disc DVD available with an extra scene , and I want it all !
