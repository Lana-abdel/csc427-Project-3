434374	2171244	87617	1.0	What a stinking ripoff !	I bought this movie with Denzel Washington on the cover and a title of License to Kill . It even says " full screen " and the back said " unrated . " Well , it was unrated all right , because it was a TV movie and Denzel Washington had a minor part in it . All I can say that Denzel must have had some time to kill before he started A Soldier's Story and made this in a day . It was certainly a complete ripoff by Echo bridge Home Entertainment to package the trash as it did and take my money . It should be sold at the dollar store for a buck . It was a Lifetime movie , pure and simple , and there is nothing I can say that is worse that that . These people ripped me off .
432376	2171244	372859	2.0	Out of the Fog comes zombie clowns	I've seen this before at least twice . Many have seen the Fog and the premise is basically the same , but the Fog was much better . Zombie fans may have also seen Zombie Lake . A Jesus Franco production that was not much better , but it had features this film could only dream of . I only watched this to see Debbie Rochon . It was also nice to see Brinke Stevens , as I will delve more into her later . Fans of either Scream Queen will be disappointed , but if you are not a fan of either , you will be disgusted at the low quality of this film . Zombie clowns eating body parts , but that's it .
434090	2171244	462538	2.0	Run ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Run !	I am probably the only person in the world that has never watched The Simpsons . I thought that I might get a glimpse of what everyone was excited about by watching this movie . If this is what it's all about , then I haven't missed a thing . Some say that the earlier years were great satire . Well , maybe that is true , and there were a few satiric anti-corporate and anti-government bits in this film , but way too few to sit through the really stupid bits that are only funny to a Middle Schooler . My only exposure to the Simpsons before this bore , was looking at the x-rated cartoons on the Internet . I'll take them anytime .
434208	2171244	83185	2.0	I watched it so you don't have to .	Out on video at last ! One of the original video nasties that were banned by Britain . It was finally released uncut in 2003 . Obviously , the Brits don't like cannibal movies as they banned five of them . This film was really bad on so many levels . It seemed as if time and distance were totally disregarded . For example , Monsieur Danville ( Olivier Mathot ) left for three days and seemed to come back in 30 minutes . The jungle must have been in Southern Spain , as it took everyone so little time to get there . If you are looking for titillating scenes , there is only one : Pamela Stanford taking a bath . Other than that the rest focused mainly on the eating of people's guts . Yech ! They really didn't need to ban this as it is too awful to watch .
433540	2171244	147507	3.0	Wake me when it's over .	When is a Limited Collector's Edition 2-Disc Set not a bargain ? When one of the movies is this one . Ronnie Sortor wrote , directed , edited and acted in this low budget indie flick . He also uses the same cast in all his movies , so if you like them in this film , they will likely be in another . Unfortunately , I couldn't find anything to like about any of them . Action got hot an heavy for a couple of minutes during the robbery , but then it died . Too many shots of actors just standing there supposedly thinking . The worst part of it all was the dude with a gut shot . Now , I have never had a gut shot , but i would imagine it to be very difficult to be running through the woods , and up and down stairs in a house with a bullet in my gut . Just seems stretching things for me , and it really bugged me throughout the film to see the guy doing it .
433986	2171244	290657	3.0	Get your spirits in a bottle .	The worst terror I can imagine is having Playboy model Beverly Lynne on top of me and then have her turn into some crone dressed as a nun . That would scare the hell out of me ! But , that is what happened in David's ( Charlie David ) dream . It seems that he and Julie ( Lynne ) moved into a haunted house - haunted by a nun ! Why ? We never find out in this film that really turns into a bore . Their friends come over that night and basically just get drunk and make fools of themselves . The killer nun is getting rid of them one by one in what can only be described as very amateur gore . There is hardly a quart of blood used in the whole film , and that includes a shower scene with Lynne where she imagines blood flowing all over her . We have Jennifer Amanda Morgan , a very hot Yvette Lopez , and Lindsey Labrum all at the party and we have zero action . What a bummer ! If you want to see has over 60 appearances that seem to over good possibilities . Films like Kinky Sex Club , Bikini Chain Gang , and Emmanuelle Tango . Check those out and leave this one alone .
432255	2171244	342835	3.0	But I'm not gonna be gone , EVER	This is not going down as one of the all-time greats . Hey , I was just looking for a Danny Trejo fix until Machete comes out . He played a don't-give-a-damn cop here that was not as raw as I usually see him . His partner , before she transferred to Homicide , was the ever luscious Roselyn Sanchez , who plays Elena on " Without a Trace . " She is the feature of this movie , except for , of course Nightstalker and his ever-present buddy , Demon . I only mention them in passing as they are the main characters . They really don't do much . Everything is pretty much off-camera here and the movie deserved no more that a PG-13 rating for the violence . There was no sexuality , despite the MPAA claim . I doubt they even watched it as they would be immediately put off by the Death Metal music and the absolutely irritating camera work that was supposed to show what the Nightstalker was seeing and feeling as he operated high on crack . I suppose that was the intention ; it was just plain irritating . Maybe they though the Satanic symbols were too much for the little ones , and they didn't want to be accused of offending someone's religion . Who knows ? I got my Trejo fix , and got to see Sanchez ( always fully clothed ) , so who cares . Danny Trejo was a co-producer of this film . Tood bad he didn't remember his other 138 films and give us more reason to watch .
434024	2171244	431114	4.0	Same shite , different toilet	Ho Hum . Just another flick with Steven Seagal pretending to be some spiritual being , but bashing heads and killing like it was nothing . He , of course , justifies it in the end by donating the money to an orphanage . , How sweet . Lay the world to waste and we'll ignore it if you take care of a little girl . Jeesh ! This time , he is partnered with Ice Cool ( Anthony ' Treach ' Criss ) . Gotta have someone to lay all those cringe-inducing lines on , man , and there are plenty . The dialog is pure crap . They go after bad guys Nick Mancuso and Kevin Tighe , two people that were born to play the scumbags . He's squeezing Mari Morrow and impressing soap star Sarah Buxton . How cute . I guess if you gotta have some July Force excitement , this may suffice . If nothing else it will help you get your degree in Seagalology .
434404	2171244	77912	4.0	Would you like some wine with this cheese ?	Remember the video nasty called Blood Feast . it was banned in Britain , and finally let in in 2005 . This film is a cheesy remake of the Herschell Gordon Lewis classic . It was banned and never let in . Instead of an Egyptian goddess , this guy here ( William Metzo ) is making sacrifices to some Aztec goddess . He takes a prostitute ( Laura Misch Owens ) home , oils her up , and performs his ritual , which includes removing her heart . The cop ( Curt Dawson ) is too busy getting prostitutes ( Gwen Arment ) in bed himself to solve the crime . I really don't get this police sergeant strolling though the city with his arm around the prostitute . While he is in bed , another girl gives her heart to the slasher . This doesn't make the police chief too happy as Mardi Gras is about to start and they need to get Jaws out of the water . Sorry , wrong film . Cheesy dialog , hairy men in wife-beaters , incompetent cops , and a score that belongs in a porno film : all the elements of a good grade Z grindhouse film .
433094	2171244	412260	4.0	45 Days in Jail	It should be no surprise that this was the best selling and best renting video of 2005 . 62 minutes of Paris Hilton gets up the curiosity of many . Who else gets 45 days in jail for a parole violation and it makes national news ? The best part of this film is seeing the " deer caught in the headlights " look of Paris . Other than that it is just a typical porn tape . Don't waste your money as the whole thing is available on the internet for free .
433745	2171244	461826	4.0	I was talking to the vampire .	Estrella ( Nerea Inchausti ) is a good student , but she is a loner . She reads horror novels , and watches horror movies , like the Spanish version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre , and keeps a statue of Nosferatu in her room . The chainsaw killer is a friend that only she can see , unlike her " vampire " friend that can walk around in the daylight . Her mother , Angela ( Goya Toledo ) , is a nurse , which leaves the child alone much of the time while she works on rotating shifts . She also engages in kinky sex at the hospital and in the apartment garage . Her daughter catches her and is very upset . She brings the " vampire " home and mom has to face some hard realities . There is no real horror in the film . What we see is surreal - a figment of the girl's imagination . This is made clear in the final scene , and I am not sure what the whole point of the movie was . Unsupervised children may be reading and watching inappropriate material , but a parent has to work , so what are you to do ? If that was the point , then it was lost on me . I certainly won't be staying awake because of this film . It was hard enough to stay awake through it .
433621	2171244	51381	4.0	A clever way to keep your friends close .	Now , this is a strange little man . Mr Franz ( John Hoyt ) makes dolls . But , in addition to his regular dolls , he has some very special ones that look oh so realistic . Left by his wife for an acrobat , Franz has found a way that one one he loves will ever leave again . Sally Reynolds ( June Kenney ) , his new secretary found out the hard way that Franz can't bear to part with those he loves . But , the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray , and so do the plans of Mr Franz as Bob ( John Agar ) save the day and his love . A strange film .
434367	2171244	221263	5.0	Perfect for the raincoat crowd	I think this will be it for the exploration to see what played in Times Square grindhouse in the sixties . This is perfect grindhouse fare . The drug-induced orgies that are part and parcel of the photographers and models who seek pleasure in whatever form . It's all her for those who enjoy boobies and asses and fruit fetishism ( Oh ! what that girl did with a banana ! ) and a little S & M thrown in for the folks that get off on that . All comes to a crashing end as one model turns on two others with a meat cleaver . Did she pick that up at the store on the way or does she carry it around in her purse ? No dialog , except for the narrator ; this was just pure bodies in motion for your enjoyment .
433831	2171244	160338	5.0	You're obviously mistaking me for someone with potential .	Is this what a college education in America has become ? 20 years old and college educated and heading to Harvard law , and no one shows her any respect ? No one values her or her opinions ? She is left to the lecherous machinations of someone old enough to be her father ? Sarah Polley ( Dawn of the Dead ) is cute . of course some older man is going to hit on her and maybe fulfill his life's dream . heck , I was leaching after her the entire movie . Stephen Rea swings , hits and scores ! He shows her respect for her opinion . Pulease ! She is a college graduate . How did she get through ? I was really disappointed in this film . I thought it had potential and evidently someone else thought it did too , or they wouldn't have given it all those awards .
432820	2171244	108565	5.0	All muddled up	I couldn't quite bring myself to give this film a " watch " recommendation . It fell just short , in my opinion , of a good film . Oh , it had promise . There could have been a lot more done to make this film interesting . As it was , it seemed to always be missing something . Now , I understand Jane Eyre fans know all about Edward Rochester ( Nathaniel Parker ) and the " mad women who lives in the attic " ( Karina Lombard as Antoinette Cosway ) . But , not having read the books , I have to rely on the movie to tell the story . In that it fails . There are just too many unanswered questions and the ending was most unsatisfying . Maybe I could go read Jane Eye and come back , but I doubt I will .
434432	2171244	769539	5.0	Deal with the Devil	This was a very interesting film about a man , Darren ( Brian Prost - All Wrapped Up ) who has three minutes to decide to make a deal with what was obviously the devil . He sustained injuries that would put him in a vegetative coma . We assume he signed the contract , as he lives and we see him a month later . But Darren does not seem to be happy . Does he regret the deal ? It does not appear that he has been asked to do anything , but a waitress ( Nicole 11 : 11 ) that served him and his wife ( Debbie Rochon ) turns up dead . What rotten timing ! She dies just as she was about to remove her bra . I have to call that lousing directing on the part of writer / director Neil McCurry , and the reason it was not rated higher . But , things are not what they seem and soon ( as this is a short ) we know the real truth about the deal with the devil .
432782	2171244	52969	5.0	Their available food on ze island is nearing depletion !	Killer shrews ! mad Scientists ! Lover's quarrels ! All this and more ! I just knew that I have seen James Best somewhere before . He has been in 177 films and TV shows , but Istill didn't remember because I have only watched " The Dukes of Hazzard " once or twice . he's Sheriff Rosco P . Coltrane ! You just can't hide that face . Here he is a simple boat Captain delivering supplies to an island with crazy scientists doing genetic experiments . They created some killer shrews that looked just ghastly . The teeth were four or five inches long ! Worse than that , they used some poison that didn't kill them , but will certainly kill you with just a scratch . A horrid night with the shrews attacking and the Captain trying to save sultry blonde Ingrid Goude , not only from the shrews , but from Ken Curtis ( Festus Haggen from " Gunsmoke " ) who wanted her for his own . Innovative escape and lots of rabid shrew action .
433237	2171244	64972	5.0	It is a bus that has come from hell .	The Golden Age of sexploitation in the late sixties gives us another feature from Something Weird . This one is towards the end of the era and it shows . There is actually a story here and much more action that would satisfy viewers . The production values are still really poor , but there is enough to keep your interest . It concerns a group of hooligans - four males and a female - that break into a house and rape a housewife after giving her heroin . A saleslady comes to the door and they giver her a sugar cube , presumably with acid , and rape her too . They then steal a bus , kill the driver , and pick up two more women . Lots of action ensues , including rape and a really hot lesbian scene at the end . This is definitely a film that earns the genre of sexploitation .
434418	2171244	71508	5.0	To know death Otto , you have to fck life . . . in the gall bladder !	It's very hard to recommend this film , but it is also hard to dismiss it as Criterion saw fit to issue it in their collection . Udo Kier ( Halloween 2007 , Grindhouse , All the Queen's Men , and all of Lars von Trier's movies ) is the strangest Baron Frankenstin I have ever seen . He gets a certain glee out of playing with internal organs . He is into incest and necrophilia , and has plans to create a Master race obedient to him - sound familiar . Of course , his plans go awry when he selects the wrong head for his Frankenstein . His sister / wife ( Monique Van Vooren ) is more concerned with the stable-boy ( Joe Dallesandro ) . Funny and strange , Paul Morrissey has written and directed a decidedly different version of Mary Shell's story .
434025	2171244	49084	5.0	No longer children , but not yet women .	This is a curiosity in that it is Catherine Deneuve's film debut . She is the little one that sneaks into the pantry at night pretending to be sleepwalking . I understand that most of her shots were removed from the film when it was sent to America , but this copy has all of them restored . O course , the interest is in the moody and mysterious Catherine ( Marie-Hélène Arnaud ) , who joins the school late in the year . She looks more adult than school child . Sylvie Dorléac plays the part of Adelaide , Sylvie is actually Catherine Deneuve's sister , as La Deneuve was Catherine Dorléac when she appeared in this film . This film has been altered in another way . Georgina Spelvin ( The Devil in Miss Jones ) and , I'm guessing Yvonne Monlaur were added for American audiences . The luscious breasts and bodacious bootys were spliced in and the actresses appear no where else in the film . Their scenes are well lit also . You would think it daylight instead of night .
432381	2171244	331720	5.0	No real action here	This episode starts of a la James Bond , as Zero Woman ( Mikiyo Ono ) is swimming , apparently alone , then all hell breaks loose . The diminutive beauty appears to meet her match with a character taken right from the WWE . But , she manages to prevail . As she does with a really dumb hit-man who lets her get all the way across the room to get to her gun . Dude , you really should find another line of work . The big drawback to the film is that the action comes rarely and the time is filled with dreams and flashbacks to others . Do we really need to spend valuable film stock watching someone eat noodles and look out the window ? We get the impression that Zero Woman is a really unhappy agent . But , that is not surprising when a guy she is having sex with gets blown away before he can finish the job , leaving her high and dry . You really felt for the waiter that tried to cheer this babe up . Even he couldn't get a smile out of her ; and he couldn't bring home the bacon , either . I do have to say that I really enjoyed the photography of Hiroshi Takase . The picture was incredibly beautiful .
432525	2171244	71413	5.0	My face ! Look what you did to my beautiful face !	AKA The Horrible House on the Hill , a five children survive a rollover in the snow-capped mountains of San Bernardino . They were on the way to a mental hospital , so you can imagine what comes next . One of the children thinks she is a nun , complete with habit . One of the children is teen pop idol Leif Garrett , whose mommy , Carolyn Stellar , shows off her lovelies very early in the movie . We'll see those lovelies again later when Sister Hannah tries to baptize her . Getting rid of the man who was taking them to the asylum in a long attack in the basement , they proceed to terrorize the rest of the house . Not very bloody , but good use of piranhas , and watching Sister Hannah give the last rites was a religious experience .
434571	2171244	101301	6.0	This is Santa Claus , not Dear Abby .	How can you watch a movie with Thora Birch and not just want to eat her up for being so cute . I am not referring to the lovely Thora in American Beauty , but the really cute one in this film . She just wants Santa to get her parents back together . Her brother Ethan ( Ethan Embry ) doesn't believe in Santa , so he tries to help make his sister's wish come true with the help of the lovely Amy Oberer . Now , I don't know what mom ( Harley Jane Kozak ) sees in Kevin Nealon , when her ex is Jamey Sheridan ( Syriana , " Law & Order : Criminal Intent " ) , so he must have screwed up big time . Anyway , Ethan comes through and all is well . Or , was it Santa ( Leslie Nielsen ) ?
433048	2171244	462482	6.0	Interesting little flick	It's not going to win any awards , and the acting is not the greatest , but the story is interesting in a Stepford Wives / Wicker man sort of way . TV director / producer Michelle Maxwell MacLaren did a good job of presenting a story by new writer Michael Kingston in his sophomore effort . The actors are not the thing here , but the story , and it has probably been done before , but I found it captivating . If this town voted in this year's primaries , it would be a 100 % vote for Huckabee . It's that kind of town , and you better conform or they have ways of making you do so . The " doctor " has no medical training and doesn't need any as he has perfected the necessary procedure for dissidents . They don't need jails , because they will have your complete cooperation once they are done . Besides voicing concern , wanting to leave is considered a sign of sickness , and will be dealt with . The town's population has remained at 436 for over 100 years . They have elaborate rituals to make sure it stays that way . Like the Roach Motel , once you check in , you can't check out . It is the thinking behind this number that was the really interesting part of the film . I know people like this , and you do too . The existence of Rockwell Falls in America is very believable .
433759	2171244	112887	6.0	You're like a life support system for a cock !	This is definitely one for the Rose McGowan ( Grindhouse , The Black Dahlia ) fans . She is in various stages of undress throughout the entire movie . She and her boyfriend James Duval ( Donnie Darko ) take a trip and pick up a passenger Johnathon Schaech ( 8MM 2 ) that definitely has a dark side . McGowan alternates between the two of them when Schaech is not blowing someone's head off . The talking head in the platter of chili cheese dogs is a must-see . The film is definitely different . I detected a strong undercurrent of bisexuality throughout , and the ending may be hard for some to take , but this is definitely the most you will ever see of McGowan .
432974	2171244	105104	6.0	Oh no , Marti . I'm going to kill you during .	OK , I do not recommend this movie unless you have 90 minutes to waste and just want some mindless action in the background while you are doing something else . I like Jean Claude Van Damme , Sylvester Stalone , Steven Seagal , and Wesley Snipes when I want vicarious thrills , loud noise , and furious action . No plots , little dialog to ponder , just action . They all do a good job . Snipes was his usual self , Bruce Payne made a good terrorist , and Elizabeth Hurley was easy on the eyes . ' Nuff said .
433114	2171244	493404	6.0	I gotta get that bastard !	I tend to be attracted to any movie featuring Sid Haig ( The Devil's Rejects , House of 1000 Corpses ) . Add vampire to the theme and you have me hooked . This isn't a traditional vampire tale , but more a film noir thriller where a group of vampire hunters is seeking the brother of a rich CEO ( William Snow ) . The brother was bitten in Romania . Meanwhile , the vampires themselves are hunting the same brother to prevent the resurrection of " Vlad Bossei " a super-vampire who lived in the 12th century . There film is definitely nonlinear as we jump from today , where Carrie ( Pratt ) is a captive of Pashek ( Haig ) and Fork ( Wes Ramsey ) ; to yesterday , where they are trying to get information out of Stanis ( Ken Foree - Rob Zombie's Halloween , The Devil's Rejects ) ; to last week to get the full story . Victoria Pratt ( " Mutant X " , Kraken : Tentacles of the Deep ) is the leader of the vampire hunters , and does a very good job in this film . I also enjoyed Wes Ramsey's performance . The twist at the end screams sequel .
433946	2171244	70547	6.0	I am , in my own fashion , also a lady of the night .	This movie has as much life as the Countess's zombie housekeeper . Even Rosalba Neri's hot body couldn't get things exciting . But . then the housekeeper ( Rosalba Neri ) bathes the Countess in hot blood , and it gets a little steamier . But , the real deal in this Italian classic is Dracula's ring . With it , the Countess summons young maidens from the village to fulfill her needs . She is a real hero to me in that she doesn't seek power or glory or riches , just young maidens to frolic with before she drinks and bathes in their blood . Bwa ha ha ha . And it's not just a single serving for the Countess , she orders in a five-pack , then does the funky chicken , and , voilà , 10 perfect breasts , extra spicy Italian-style . Yum . Now , she must just avoid the evil Herr Schiller ( Mark Damon ) , who wants to take her hand for his own purposes . They don't make them like this anymore .
432794	2171244	74085	6.0	The Holocaust continues	I have no particular affinity for the Isralies . I just happen to believe that genocide is evil , no matter who the victims are . Wheteher is be Israeli , Darfur , or Sunni Muslims in Iraq , it is evil . This film did a credible job of showing this evil by giving us another picture of what happened in Munich in 1972 . It should be seen by all to know how morally bankrupt those people are that practice genocide . William Holden gave a great performance in one of his last films as the police chief . Franco Nero ( Camelot , The Virgin and the Gypsy ) was equally good as the terrorist leader . Check this out when is shows on cable .
434487	2171244	338410	6.0	A Slacker Christmasd	I could just sit and stare at Lauren Holley for 100 minutes and never complain . She is just so cute ! She was cute as a button in the charming tale of Santa , Jr . ( Nick Stabile ) , a slacker that couldn't understand the meaning of Christmas . She almost ended up spending Christams stuck in the house with him after he was placed on house arrest , but Judd Nelson comes to the rescue , and he and his partner ( George Wallace ) manage to keep her occupied . Santa Jr , and his elf ( Ed Gale - O Brother , Where Art Thou ? and Chucky's stunt double ) get it together in time to save Christmas , and the slacker learns that the Christmas spirit is not about Christmas , but exists any time you do something for someone else with no expectation of reward .
434071	2171244	74226	6.0	There's a bald maniac in there , and he's going bat sht !	This movie would be primarily of interest to those who grew up in the late sixties and early seventies and knew what LSD was . I remember a friend who was using the stuff and he warned us that it had different effects on different people . I stayed away from it . Well , maybe it wasn't the people that were the factor , but it was bad LSD like the batch in the movie . I watched it primarily because I remembered Zalmon King from the Red Shoe Diaries and Delta of Venus . Other than that , I can't imagine why I watched this DVD . He did a good job in a mediocre movie . Deborah Winters , who played his girlfriend was also good . No gore ; it was people going crazy 10 years later . I guess you better be careful or your past will come back to haunt you .
432716	2171244	330501	6.0	Really creepy horror film	I have not seen the original film , so I can't make any comparison . Supposedly this " sequel " contains 40 minutes of the original and just 36 minutes of new material . No matter to me , as this is one of the creepiest films I have seen . I was literally jumping out of my seat at times . The mother and child really creeped me out . People dying all over the place due to some curse that resulted from a murder by a father . Creepy music , and some bizarre deaths make this an interesting movie . The non-linear style may put some off , but I really enjoyed it . There are apparently four of these films , so I will be looking for them all . Of course , I can also check out the American remakes which feature the mother ( Takako Fuji ) and the father ( Takashi Matsuyama ) .
433430	2171244	113360	6.0	How much blood do I have to bath in , to get clean ?	Samurai flicks may be considered a guilty pleasure , but this one is well worth watching . It is not a Toshiro Mifune classic , but it features plenty of Samurai action and lots of blood is spilled . Christopher Lambert ( Highlander I , II , and III ; Mortal Kombat ) plays an American businessman who picks up an extremely lovely Joan Chen ( Lust , Caution ; Xiu Xiu : The Sent-Down Girl ) in a bar and they have a pleasurable time before ninjas arrive to kill her for a transgression . The leader , John Lone ( The Last Emperor , Year of the Dragon ) is identified and the hunt begins . The businessman enlists the help of super Japanese actor Yoshio Harada and Yôko Shimada ( Shogun and " Shogun " ) . What he doesn't realize ifs the Samurai isn't really interested in helping , he just wants to do battle with the Ninja . It's fast paced and exciting with enough exploitation to make it special .
433777	2171244	96211	6.0	An Irish Seagal / Stallone	You have seen it before in The Specialist or in films like On Deadly Ground or The Fire Below . Tough guy goes against the evil corporate empire that is out for profit and the people be damned . Of course , Steven Seagal or Sly Stallone may be quicker to jump into it that was Pierce Brosnan . He was battling his own personal demons , and just wanted to live a quiet life in the village of his birth ; well , as quiet a life that can be lived by a bill collector . You know , make a little money , drink a little whiskey , and once in a while a pretty girl comes along like Alison Doody ( Dr . Elsa Schneider in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade ) . But , this is Pierce Brosnan and he is infinitely more watchable that the others .
433056	2171244	286594	6.0	Well-paced thriller	Writer / director Nick Willing did a very good job of keeping the action moving in this thriller ( also known as Close Your Eyes , and Hypnotic ) that kept you enchanted throughout . Of course , the premise of the story is a bit far fetched , that doesn't detract from a good mystery involving a Doctor ( played perfectly by Goran Visnjic - " ER " ) , and a cop ( Shirley Henderson - Moaning Myrtle in two Harry Potter films , and Jude in the two Bridget Jones films ) . I really liked the way Henderson played the cop . She was believable in a story that didn't make a lot of sense outside the chase for the murderer . Sophie Stuckey in her first film did a really good job as the object of the search .
433555	2171244	427954	6.0	Where the hell is my elephant ?	One would not think that an elephant would be so important that someone would travel from Thailand to Austrailia to find one - or two - but , apparently they are something special to Khan ( Thai Warrior's Tony Jaa ) . Unlike the PC martial arts in Super Hawk , the action here gets downright bone cracking . Reminisent of Jet Li , Khan can take on a couple of dozen without breaking a sweat , but breaking bones along the way . But , it is those big suckers that he has to fight that really make things interesting . I didn't know that they made them that big ! There isn't much story except for the quest for his elephants , so everything is put into the martial arts . BMX and roller blade fans can appreciate the warehouse fight , while the water fight in the temple gives a view of different martial arts styles . If you like your action almost continuous and highly stylized , then this is for you . Expect much much more from Jaa .
434399	2171244	140588	6.0	Anti-war nazisploitation	While this isn't one of the infamous nazisploitation video nasties like Gestapo's Last Orgy or Love Camp 7 , it would have probably made the list if they tried to release it in Britain . It is nazisploitation , make no mistake , even though it has more of a story than the similar Salon Kitty . A Jewish couple are separated by war and she ( Sirpa Lane ) is sent to a love camp to service German soldiers . It includes an average of about eight breasts a minute , rape , actual penetration , lesbianism , bloody caning , eugenics , girl-on-girl , : all the features of a typical nazisploitation . Soon Hannah ( Lane ) attracts the attention of a Nazi officer ( Giancarlo Sisti ) , who takes her home . She fits right in , which is not surprising for someone who let her mother ( Margherita Horowitz ) die for her before she was captured . Her reunion with her beloved Klaus ( Roberto Posse ) , who was now a German officer , was not pleasant . She ends up running a high-class brothel like Salon Kitty , without the Caberet singing . She re-finds her identity before she dies . WWII aficionados will appreciate the extensive use of actual war footage in the film to stretch it out with little cost .
434289	2171244	35553	6.0	I am Tondelayo .	One can only wonder how many posters of Hedy Lamarr as Tondelayo were pinned up by soldiers in WWII . She is seductive and appealing and downright hot as a half African who spends the entire film in bra and sarong . Most of the time she is striking seductive poses and lounging on a couch showing off her magnificent body that matches her unequaled facial features . This is a comedy for the most part , and it is really funny . Frank Morgan is back , not a The Pirate , but as a drunken doctor that has probably been drummed out of the medical establishment and can only get work on this African plantation . Walter Pidgeon , who would go one to capture two Oscar nominations in the next two years ( Mrs . Miniver , Madame Curie ) , was the leader of the plantation and the colonial law . He was hilarious as a succession of new assistants arrived in white , freshly starched clothing from the Mother Country , and all said the exact same words that drove him nuts . Of course , he warned all of them about Tondelayo , even banning her from the camp , but it was useless as they all succumbed to her charms . A must-see for those who appreciate what made our fathers happy in the Big One .
433258	2171244	167498	6.0	Ex-Yakuza chooses : buddies or babe	The formula is simple : take a long-legged Japanese beauty like Kaori Shimamura , who looks really good with a gun in her hand , and can also display a magnificent body during the sex scenes , and put a shell of a story around it . In this case , we have our girl trying to hit the head of the Yakuza for killing her sister . There is lots of shooting ( both bullets and sperm ) and blood enough to appease the vampires in the audience . There is also some really strange action that will best be left for the viewer to discover . One of the best I've seen .
432421	2171244	772193	6.0	The story behind the story	There is certainly no shortage of films about man-eating animals . To have one with a 30-foot croc that is just terrifying is probably not original either . Basically , it is just Jaws with bad skin . And , yes they did put together a cast that is a cliché . The dude with an attitude , Dominic Purcell , who probably got his gig on " Prison Break " from this , the large-chested babe , Brooke Langton , from " Melrose Place , " who can barely keep her shirt on , and , of course , the comic relief in the form of Orlando Jones ( From Dusk Till Dawn 3 : The Hangman's Daughter ) . Add the grizzled guide , Jürgen Prochnow ( Beerfest , The DaVinci Code ) and the cute kid that wants to come to America , Gabriel Malema , and you have a formula for getting butts in the seats . But , there was another story going on that was worth watching . In this beautiful South African locale , we are told the story of the civil war in Burundi that lasted for 12 years and consumed many more people than the croc could . But , no one is going to Tivo a story about deaths in Africa when they don't even care about blacks that are getting killed right around the block . That doesn't mean the story is not important enough to keep telling . Maybe someday we will care about Burundi , Rwanda and Darfur .
433660	2171244	74776	6.0	You don't die for women . You kill for them .	It is not often that you see an " R " rated western . It was even initially banned in Sweden , if you can believe that . But , that was for what was considered excessive violence , including a rape . But , there was not much violence when you consider the torture porn of today , and there was no nudity , despite Oscar-nominee Barbara Hershey's long history of flashing her breasts in several movies , notably Boxcar Bertha just four years before . James Coburn plays the role of a tough half-breed that wants to torture Charlton Heston for killing his wife eleven years previous when he was a sheriff . He almost gets his wish , but , hey , this is a western , and you can't ever let the bad guys win . This is the way they should have all been made .
433279	2171244	71240	6.0	I felt like I was watching a documentary	This was New Mexico , but I have seen many such facilities during my time as a foster caseworker over nine years in Texas . The only thing that was outside my knowledge was the isolation . I cannot imagine that any facility has a solitary confinement room . The terrible tragedy of young women depicted in this film was real . Abuse and neglect by parents who cannot and will not take the time to raise their children properly and are surprised when they rebel . Christine never had a chance . She was kicked out by an abusive father and a mother who could not defend her . She was probably getting beaten herself . She was thrown in with too many others who had problems of their own that were not being addressed . After abuse at home and in the system , she hardened just like prisoners do and was forever lost . 15-year-old Oscar nominee and Golden Globe winner Linda Blair was magnificent in this realistic film .
432261	2171244	395585	6.0	I wouldn't be praying .	Former cameraman Steven R . Monroe directed this little psychological movie that at times was slow as molasses , but , nevertheless , an interesting glimpse of the beast within all of us . Now , I cannot compare it to Cube , Saw , or My Little Eye , as others have done as i have not seen those films . I only mention them to give you an indication of what is in store for those that have . What I can say , is that I find the premise totally believable . When the pressure is on , our hatreds and prejudices , and inner demons come out rather quickly , especially when fueled with alcohol and hunger . Only Father Duffy ( Dennis Hopper ) and Lea ( Kelly Brook ) seemed to keep their cool , but they broke down eventually , albeit for different reasons than the others . This is not a bloody film , although there is a little , but a psychological one . I was bothered by one killing that occurred off-camera , as i kept thinking the rest of the film that it was fake . The ending was weird , foreshadowing a possible sequel , but , if they do , please get another writer . Philippe Vidal's screenplay just didn't cut it for the most part . I enjoyed the film , but it could have been way better . What a waste of a Maxim magazine " Hot 100 of 2005 " list member . Another cast member was a FHM's 100 Sexiest Girls member , and another gave an outstanding display in Eyes Wide Shut . All were wasted here .
434184	2171244	465494	6.0	Yell all you like - the Lord himself won't hear you .	So , this is an adaptation from a video game . Maybe that is part of the problem . It just didn't have any soul . It was cold and mindless and exciting , but the sets looked as if they came from a video game , and there was more shooting than performing . Compare that to Jason Statham in Crank or Clive Owen in Shoot ' Em Up ; both had lots of action , but they also had characters we cared about and something of a story to follow . They had a soul . Timothy Olyphant was pleasurable , but didn't have much to work with . Ukrainian Olga Kurylenko ( Paris , je t'aime ) was an interesting character , not just for her casual dress , but she was someone you cared about . There should have been more like her . We'll get to see more of her in Quantum of Solace , and I look forward to that . The formula for the movie is entertaining , but more needed to be done .
433013	2171244	381061	6.0	Trying to sell margarine as butter	Daniel Craig is not James Bond despite the fact that we have been subjected to a 2 and one half hour sales presentation . No , this was not a Bond movie but an attempt to convince us that we needed Craig . They failed miserably . Yes , I am upset that Pierce Brosnan was replaced , but I really tried to forget that while I watched this movie . I wanted to give it a fair chance . Some may criticize the title sequence for lack of the traditional Bond women , but I thought it was absolutely brilliant . It was one of the best titles I have seen . The chase in the beginning was also a masterpiece . I kept think that this would make for a real Olympic Decathalon competition . I know it is all movie magic , but I forgot that while I was watching - it was that good . After that , the movie over over . Craig is not Bond . He looks too old and has no sophistication . Bond is not a cold killing machine . He performs his job with flair and style . Craig has none of that . And , what's with this torture ? That belongs in 24 , not a Bond movie . Eva Green is extremely lovely , but was totally wasted in this film . There were no Bond women in this film . That would have distracted us from the sales job on Craig . I'm not buying .
433754	2171244	233469	7.0	I'll show you collateral damage !	OK , here is the premise . A fireman's ( Arnold Schwarzenegger ) wife and son get blown up when a terrorist ( Cliff Curtis ) is trying to destroy some target . He googles " terrorist " on his home computer , finds out who is responsible , and goes off into the jungle to capture him . He escapes . In the meantime , he hooks up with the terrorist's wife ( Francesca Neri ) , wins her to his side , and they go off back to the States to catch him . If that is not the most unbelievable plot you can imagine , then there are some twists and turns that are even more incredible . But , who cares ? This is the Governator kicking some major butt like he did in True Lies , Commando , and many other movies that you and I watch over and over . Italian actress Neri ( Live Flesh ) is hot , Curtis ( Whale Rider ) makes a perfect terrorist , and one of my favorites , John Leguizamo ( Land of the Dead ) , plays a great part . Even Monk's agoraphobic brother , John Turturro , is here . Wow ! But , it's all about the damage , collateral and otherwise , that draws you to the movie . The fireman turned terminator turns up the heat ( red , of course ) and proceeds to erase the terrorist .
433319	2171244	629345	7.0	Justice takes a back seat	The man From U . N . C . L . E . , Oscar-nominated Robert Vaughn ( The Young Philadelphians ) appears in this episode as a man with a big grudge against Adam Schiff ( Steven Hill ) , who is fighting for his political life . His Executive A . D . A ( Sam Waterston ) is facing ethics charges , and Jaime Ross ( Carey Lowell ) is testifying as she leaves the department . What will she say ? Lt . Van Buren ( S . Epatha Merkerson ) gets the news in no uncertain terms that the brass wants her resignation for filing a lawsuit , and Lenny ( Jerry Orbach ) is debating on whether or not to make a deal with a con to kill the man who killed his daughter . Among all this , there is a 10-year-old girl that is barely alive after being raped and everyone wants this case closed pronto .
433484	2171244	52676	7.0	Are you satisfied with your equipment , Miss Allcock ?	Can you imagine students that love their headmaster ( principal ) so much that they try to sabotage his leaving by playing practical jokes when a district ( ? ) team is visiting the school ? That's the premise of this , one of the early Carry On films . I can certainly imagine the reaction of the visiting psychiatrist played by Leslie Phillips ( Venus ) when he saw Miss Allcock played by Joan Sims ( The Last of the Blonde Bombshells ) . I had the same reaction in Walmart yesterday when some young miss in short shorts and a tight Tee walked by a couple of times . Full of the usual Carry On stars and some guests , it is typical British humor at it's finest .
432105	2171244	87763	7.0	Life is all about choices	Milestone released two films by Charles Burnett last fall . His acclaimed Killer of Sheep , and this lesser known film . This film was originally released in 1983 , but has been re-cut and re-released . This is the 2007 version that I am reviewing . The slice of life that we see in this film is interesting , but confined mostly to dialog , with little action . Everett Silas stars as Pierce , an individual who is torn by his loyalty to his no-good friend , and his family . This is put to the test on Saturday as his friend dies on his brother's wedding day . It is the little things that I found fascinating in this film - the fact that a 16-year-old is constantly flirting with Pierce , who is 30 ; the stark contrast with Pierce , a working man , and his brother the professional , and the siding of Pierce's mother with wealth ; the two people he cares for who can't bathe themselves or take their medicine , and their preoccupation with religion , which also is huge with Pierce's mother . There is a wealth of material to draw upon for reflection , and Burnett has given us a good film . I can't wait to see the original .
433919	2171244	338357	7.0	The man is the message .	This particular documentary is not the greatest one to recommend for pleasurable viewing . It is basically 74 minutes of Chomsky speaking . He is a quiet man and not a great speaker , but what he has to say is very important . Lately , his position is to questioning how the U . S . can be engaged in a " war on terrorism " when the mountains of civilian corpses we've left in Southeast Asia , Central America , the Mideast , and western Africa qualify our most sanctimonious of nations as Champion Terror-Monger . His grasp of the facts and ability to recall information and present it in a fashion that all can understand serves to recommend this as a valuable 74 minutes to listen , learn , and ponder .
433496	2171244	308055	7.0	Remembering Bobby 40 years later	It is the 40th anniversary of his death and I watched this hoping for something more in line with a commemoration . Bobby Kennedy was only a small part of the film , but an extremely important part . At least I heard Ted Kennedy deliver the immortal lines that defined him : " Some men see things as they are and say why . I dream things that never were and say why not . " And , of course , the speech at the end of the film with Aretha Franklin's song was memorable . That was pretty much it as a commemoration , as it was mainly a story of the events surrounding Bobby's death . Life goes on , and the subjects of election interference , immigration , prejudice , violence , and infidelity are pretty much the same today as they were 40 years ago . Standout performances were Laurence Fishburne , Martin Sheen , Anthony Hopkins , Helen Hunt , William H . Macy , and Freddy Rodríguez . That is not to diminish the rest of the fine cast , but I remember these actors especially . It was a good film , but I wanted more .
432324	2171244	245238	7.0	It Takes Courage	It takes courage to grow up and be who you really are . I would not even pretend to know what teenage girls go through as they mature . Despite the fact that I have experience with many of them , I would not be privy to their innermost thoughts . This film can only give us a vicarious glimpse into their minds and emotions . But , that is enough for now . Piper Perabo has come a long way from Coyote Ugly and has matured into a good actress . She is Paulie , a girl abandoned twice by her mother and who is in a torrid affair with Tori ( Jessica Paré ) until they get caught by Tori's sister Allison ( Emily VanCamp ) . Tori realizes that she must deny her love and end the affair to maintain connections to her family . Another loss is more that Paulie can deal with and , despite her best efforts to get Tori to admit her love publicly , she takes the only step she knows will end her pain . A beautiful story that gives a glimpse so that we can empathize a little and grow a little and maybe find that courage .
434256	2171244	112929	7.0	What you sow you reap !	Before Ms . Scrooge , there was this film , one of only two that I am aware of with a female Scrooge . Susan Lucci was just perfect in the role of Elizabeth ( Ebbie ) Scrooge , but it was the Christmas Ghosts that really stole the show . George Kaczender ( Christmas on Division Street ) has another hit with this film that is based on Dickens ' novel . Wendy Crewson ( Santa Clause , Santa Clause 2 , The Santa Clause 3 : The Escape Clause ) plays Roberta ' Robbie ' Cratchet , a single mom with two children , including Tiny Tim . Jennifer Clement and Nicole Parker were fantastically cute as the Ghosts of Christmas Past . They had a " Dreamgirls " look at first , then switched to an " I Dream of Genie " look . It was certainly a different twist . Lorena Gale ( Premonition , Slither ) was the Ghost of Christmas present and was so funny in that role . Molly Parker from " Deadwood " was the sister / niece . This was an interesting and light version that was really enjoyable .
433957	2171244	69897	7.0	She's a wild animal ! I've got to have that girl , George ! Tonight	This is real blaxploitation with breasts flying out of dresses everywhere . The biggest ones , of course , belong to Pam Grier , the Best of the Breast . Of course , there is also Lisa Farringer in her only nude scene that I am aware of in her too short 10 year career . There is a story here , too , as Coffy seeks to take revenge on all the dope-pushing scumbags that were responsible for her little sister getting hooked . A sawed-off shotgun to the face adds some action when breasts aren't flying . And , the wild costumes the pusher / pimps wore were are real hoot !
432401	2171244	454841	7.0	Now , this was interesting	The title sequence to this movie was one of the best that I have seen in years . It was fascinating and creative and it alone makes the entire movie worthwhile . The concept is also believable . I don't recall seeing something in a horror movie that I could truly believe happened . Knowing what we know now about the testing that was done with participants knowledge , we could see something like this for real . We may not , but at least it is possible and that makes the film interesting , too . Aaron Stanford took over this movie and really made it his own . He gave an outstanding performance , and I want to see more of him . Vinessa Shaw , Dan Byrd , and Emilie de Ravin also gave performances that were imminently watchable . hey , they even had Captain Leland Stottlemeyer ( Ted Levine ) .
432283	2171244	155776	7.0	She's so evil . . . and she's only in high school !	I only watched this because of Rose McGowan ( Grindhouse ) . I guess if i watched Charmed , I would know her , but Death Proof was my introduction . I thought she was so cool , and she was in this film also . It may have been a campy film about high school , but she was just so interesting . I remember Carole Kane from " Taxi " - boy , does that date me ! I always like to see her pop up and she did a great job in this film also . Pam Grier played a police detective and I always like seeing her . I'll be checking her out next in Bones . It's a forgettable film , but it was funny and worth watching just to see some of the cast .
433952	2171244	74483	7.0	You really are a dirty bastard , ain't you , Harry ?	I really felt Dirty last night , so I revisited this film along with The Gauntlet and Magnum Force . Sometimes , you just need to immerse yourself into the world of " Dirty " Harry to remember what life is all about . There are sheep and there are goats . Most of us are sheep , but we need goats like Harry Callahan ( Clint Eastwood ) to remind us that " . . . if you want to jerk all these people off , you can , but don't do it with me . " Too often , we go along like sheep while the bureaucrats do their song and dance . Nothing gets accomplished , and people get hurt . I am not a big Tyne Daly fan , but she really did a good job as Harry's partner . Bradford Dillman , who will be back with a different name in Sudden Impact , was perfect as the toady who would kiss any butt to get promoted . Lots of action , and the heart of " Dirty " Harry shines through the rough exterior again .
432793	2171244	435670	7.0	I'm sick of you and your perfect world , because it is not perfect !	I watched this movie just to see Margarita Levieva ( Noise ) . I don't usually like Hollywood remakes , but since I have not seen the original ( Den Onsynlige ) , I had nothing to compare it to . It really captivated me : the story of betrayal and death and return as a ghost . If I had a mom ( Marcia Gay Harden ) like Nick's ( Justin Chatwin ) , I'd probably want to die also . Chatwin and Levieva were really good , as was Callum Keith Rennie ( Butterfly on a Wheel ) as Detective Larson . I was on the edge of my seat hoping for a miracle , and that is what I got .
432912	2171244	313196	7.0	I made you the priest's whore .	Only the third feature film by Mexican director Carlos Carrera , it was a Golden Globe and Oscar nominee . I am sure that the Catholic Church was not happy with that ! I can see Bill Donahue of the Catholic League fuming and frothing over a film that features a pastor laundering drug money and sleeping with his housekeeper ; another priest openly defying his Bishop to minister to the guerrillas in the mountains ; a wacky woman who fakes taking communion only to hide it and carry it home to give to her cat ; and , the greatest crime of all , Father Amaro deflowering a young girl , getting her pregnant , and praying for a miracle , which came , but not as the church would approve . There are the book purists who feel that Eça de Queirós ' novel is not given proper respect , but a movie is not a book . Gael García Bernal ( Babel , Bad Education , The Motorcycle Diaries ) is very good as the immoral new priest who impregnates the pious Amelia ( Ana Claudia Talancón - Fast Food Nation ) while spouting Bible verses to her . Of course , he uses the Song of Solomon to talk about her hair and her breasts , which were ample , indeed . Sancho Gracia was very good as Padre Benito , the only authentic priest in the movie - the one the Bishop wanted to excommunicate ! A least they didn't diddle any young boys .
432108	2171244	430105	7.0	They set Mom up . They set her up .	There isn't a lot of story here . Four brothers come home for mom's funeral and find some suspicious facts that cause them to kick ass and take names . Or , did they take the names before they kicked ass ? It doesn't matter . The movie starred some great names and had plenty of action for those who love action movies . Check it out : Mark Wahlberg ( The Departed , The Perfect Storm ) , André Benjamin ( Idlewild ) , Tyrese Gibson ( Baby Boy , Flight of the Phoenix ) , Sofía Vergara ( one of Maxim's " 100 Sexiest Women " ) , Garrett Hedlund ( Eragon , Troy ) , Terrence Howard ( Hustle & Flow , Crash ) , Chiwetel Ejiofor ( American Gangster , Children of Men ) , and Taraji P . Henson ( Hustle & Flow , Baby Boy ) . What a cast for an action movie ! Only criticism : When a film advertises nudity , I do NOT want to see some guys butt as the only nudity in the film . Cheesh !
433628	2171244	844708	7.0	The Last House Redux	The no-remake purists will be screaming , but the fact is that the 1972 Wes Craven film was just a remake of a film that 99 % of the purists have probably never seen . This film beats the 1972 film by a mile . First , there is the rape scene that one newspaper reviewer called " . . . one of the most graphically brutal and terrifying rapes ever put on screen . " Obviously , he never saw I Spit on Your Grave . That was brutal ! What I am most reminded of in watching this film is Wes Craven's Red Eye . The tension and surprises were continual once that family ( Tony Goldwyn & Monica Potter ) realizes who is responsible for what happened to their daughter ( Sara Paxton ) . You will also note the torture porn elements as the father selects from a shelf full of implements to use in seeking revenge . The use of household appliances was a unique element not seen before , and really gave a graphic and satisfying ending to the film . I was gratified that the final fight sequence was realistic in the sense that , despite the adrenaline rushing through the father , he was still getting his ass whipped until the son appeared . It took a tag team approach to bring that sucker down and prepare him for his just rewards . Fans of the genre have to be a little disappointed that the only titillating scenes came from the killers girlfriend ( Riki Lindhome ) , and only towards the end of the film . All-in-all , it was superior to the 1972 film and a worth successor to the Bergman original .
432442	2171244	1002695	7.0	A Cirque du Soleil of the mind	If I was able to get an invitation to be one of the 1000 to attend this conference , I would not be able to come up with the $6000 needed to register . Now , I no longer have to . Even if i cannot mix with the superstars in the world of innovative design , and science , and arts , I can still enjoy their presentations . This film gives you just a taste of what the movers and shakers experiences . People from Google , Microsoft , people with ideas meeting people with money and entrepreneurial skills . People from arts and people who are making a difference in the world . Innovators in theoretical physics share the stage with the creator of the $100 laptop . Ideas in how we will interact with computers are viewed along with new ways of viewing and sharing data . People like Majora Carter talk about wanting to make sustainability sexy while schmoozing with Al Gore , who exhorts us to get our act together . Award winners are encourages to rub the magic lamp and present a bold idea that could change the world . Bono did it in the past and One . org was created . Out of this year's conference comes Pangea Day . Now , everyone can share the experience and ideas on Ted . com . It may be post-conference , but the inspiring and innovative speeches are there to watch over and over . Check it out .
434507	2171244	976143	7.0	You choose your quality of life ; why not your quality of death ?	So , you are healthy ( for the most part ) and not a burden to anyone , why should you not choose when you can depart this world . Who better that you to say when enough is enough . That's the tough question to answer , but it is put forth in this film as it focuses on Mademoiselle Lisette Nigot . Of course , the easier question is why can't those with a terminal disease and in constant pain be allowed to go ? That example is also given and it is harder for a rational human being to deny this individual relief from pain . The right to die is surely as important as the right to live , or maybe it isn't . You owe it to yourself and society to be informed on the question , and this film does an excellent job of doing just that .
433976	2171244	426883	7.0	Have you ever been laid , Stolen Boy ?	The most telling moment of the film is when they were all together and making fun of the rappers with guns . You had no indication that guns were a big part of their lives , but they were there , just below the surface , and used when necessary . The movie moves on to a life of partying with the drug dealing below the surface until someone stepped over the line . Then things took a real twist when a crime of opportunity presented itself . You always hoped that things would turn out for the best . You were never really prepared for a dark conclusion . It just hit and hit hard . Justin Timberlake was outstanding and the person who really carried this movie . Anton Yelchin did a really great job as Zack . I certainly enjoyed Sharon Stone and was impressed with her part . Dominique Swain was great as Susan . My biggest complaint was the unrealistic lack of skin in situations that really called for it . It was obvious enough to be a distraction .
433584	2171244	87980	8.0	It's easy to be a holy man on top of a mountain .	War can change you . Travel to other lands can change you also . Seeing how many people in the world live and enjoy themselves without a big house and a new car every year makes you a different person . Different enough that the superficiality that once was your life seems meaningless , and you start looking for something more . Larry ( Bill Murray ) found that his old life just wasn't fulfilling , and he tossed it aside to find something else . It is easy to say that he suffered from PTSD , but that is just something to sooth the minds of those that don't get it . It was fascinating to see the similarities between Larry's time - 1929 - and today . People are still committing suicide when they lose their fortunes . They cannot imagine life without fame and fortune . They fall apart in the face of tragedy . Larry was looking for more and that took him to the mountains of India . The cinematography was breathtaking in India . It is not hard to see one's insignificance amidst the majesty of the mountains . Even in a serious role , Murray had his comic genius ; it was just subtle . He was assisted very ably with Denholm Elliott , Catherine Hicks , and Theresa Russell .
434632	2171244	95497	8.0	It is accomplished !	How could I not like this movie based on the superlative novel by Nikos Kazantzakis ? Besides being a great film , it has so many of my favorites . Staring with the director , Martin Scorsese , who did this just before Goodfellas . I can imagine that he took a lot of heat for this film , which depicts Jesus ( Willem Dafoe ) doing things that we all do , like getting married , and making explicit and sensual , but not pornographic love with the luscious Barbara Hershey ( with tattoos and lots of mascara ) as Mary Magdalene . Do you think The Davinci Code was right ? here is the evidence . Harvey Keitel , another favorite , was especially great as Judas ; I just like seeing him act . And , David Bowie as Pontius Pilate . Who thought up that one ? He was magnificent ! This is no sappy Christ picture . It is harsh and real and angry . Christ is depicted with a rabble-rousing fervor . He has doubts and doesn't feel that he is worthy . He even steps down from his mission to raise a family . You have to look at this with an open mind and still it may be hard to take . In this film , Christ not above us , and above our weaknesses , but on a level with us , and prone to the same doubts and temptations . With lots of blood and Peter Gabriel's music , the film is a feast for the senses .
434111	2171244	113083	8.0	Melodrama Almodovar-style	Only Pedro Almodovar can do a melodrama that crosses genres like this film . In one sense , this is a film that you would expect to see on Lifetime . Marisa Paredes ( All About My Mother , Life is Beautiful ) is nothing less than outstanding a a writer that is going through a crisis with a husband ( Imanol Arias ) that does not love her anymore . There is , of course , a crisis with her mother ( Chus Lampreave - Volver ) at the same time . Then , she finds out that it is her best friend that is having an affair with her husband , and there are profession problems at the same time . Sounds just like a Lifetime movie , doesn't it ? But , Almodovar manages to give us a great story with his twists . Laughs are generous as comedic situations occur throughout . It's like wanting to laugh at something at a funeral . It happens , and we just have to deal with it . Juan Echanove ( who supposedly gave a great performance in Alatriste , the film that I have been waiting for release theatrically , or on DVD ) is superb as Ángel , the newspaper editor who fulfills a dream to write romance novels . and who is in love with Leo ( Parades ) . It is just another great film from Almodovar that defies a description that would ever do it justice . Only experiencing his films can ever be pleasure .
433187	2171244	186730	8.0	So we throw half in the trash , and see what we can do with the others ?	It always happens . When things get tough , local , State , and the federal government save money on the backs of the poor first . Who , besides the poor suffer , the teachers , of course ? This is a magnificent story of pre-school teachers coping with abuse , neglect , incest , and all forms of child abuse while the government agencies that are supposed to help just make excuses . The school is falling apart and being broken into for food , and the school board , and the police do little or nothing to help . Families are coping with 34 % unemployment and the resulting depression . Sound familiar ? It is also happening all over America , not just in France . The teacher training even tells new teachers that they will be social workers more than teachers . It is difficult to understand how learning can take place with children who are hungry , cold , and abused . Philippe Torreton does an excellent job as Daniel Lefebvre in writer / director Bertrand Tavernier's film . His frustration and anger shows whether he is throwing out a child welfare worker or yelling at the Mayor for cutting lunches . All the while he has to deal with problems at home and his ailing father .
433801	2171244	256009	8.0	What is a ghost ? A tragedy condemned to repeat itself time and again ? An instant of pain , perhaps . Something dead which still seems to be alive .	A steady diet of the usual horror flicks might lead one to think that all horror must have copious amounts of blood and bared breasts . To see a master craftsman at work like Guillermo del Toro ( Pan's Labyrinth , Cronos ) is a real treat . Like Pan's Labyrinth , this film is set during the Spanish Civil War , during the last days when Franco's invading army was about to defeat the defenders of democracy and freedom . In a small orphanage run by Marisa Paredes ( The Flower of My Secret ) and Federico Luppi ( Pan's Labyrinth , Cronos ) , the children of the left are cared for . Left there after the death of his father is Carlos ( Fernando Tielve ) , who sees the ghost of a dead boy in the cellar . Eduardo Noriega plays the gardener , who thinks there is gold hidden in the orphanage and is screwing the headmistress to find the key . Carlos is slowing learning to trust / accept the ghost and eventually learns the truth of it's death , and it's need for revenge to rest . The film is beautifully shot , and a slowly developing tale of pain . Not only the pain of the ghost , but the pain of Spain as it is dying .
432682	2171244	378407	8.0	I just got a date with Drew Barrymore .	This was really a funny film and a salute to those who persist in their dreams . They can come true if you just keep at it . Brian Herzlinger , an aspiring filmmaker , and his pals Jon Gunn and Brett Winn put together this documentary using $1100 bucks he won on a game show . Its a good first effort , and was an enjoyable film , especially the actual date . We got to see a side of Drew Barrymore that we would not normally see , and it was worth the effort . Remember that great line from Notting Hill : " After all . . . I'm just a girl , standing in front of a boy , asking him to love her . " I am so reminded of that when I see Drew Barrymore in her natural state in this film . What a girl !
434318	2171244	65528	8.0	Get back in the car , you smirking slut !	Dr . ' Doc ' Daneeka : Sure . Catch-22 . Anyone who wants to get out of combat isn't really crazy , so I can't ground him . Yossarian : OK , let me see if I've got this straight . In order to be grounded , I've got to be crazy . And I must be crazy to keep flying . But if I ask to be grounded , that means I'm not crazy anymore , and I have to keep flying . Dr . ' Doc ' Daneeka : You got it , that's Catch-22 . Yossarian : Whoo . . . That's some catch , that Catch-22 . Dr . ' Doc ' Daneeka : It's the best there is . People don't want to watch movie showing the stupidity of war . They want heroes so they can go to sleep at night thinking all those dead soldiers meant something . Unfortunately , war is just failed diplomacy , or someone showing how big his cajones are . What's the purpose of an Army if we can't use it ? Why are the Japanese now dropping bombs . Because a defensive Army is useless in showing cajones . Alan Arkin is magnificent as Capt . John Yossarian , who just wants to go home . He knows he's crazy to keep flying , but knowing that means he's not crazy , so he has to keep flying , which is crazy . The cast of this movie is one of the best I have seen : Martin Balsam , Richard Benjamin , Art Garfunkel , Bob Newhart , Paula Prentiss , Norman Fell , Charles Grodin and more giving us laughs aplenty from Buck Henry's superb screenplay based on Joseph Heller's novel under the direction of Mike Nichols . And , of course , there is Olimpia Carlisi , reason alone to watch .
433686	2171244	364656	8.0	Noir is dead ; long live neo-noir	Film Noir has not existed since the sixties , but filmmakers are incorporating the aspects of the genre into new films . Examples include Fargo , Se7en , L . A . Confidential , Pulp Fiction , The Usual Suspects , Memento , Reservoir Dogs , and Sin City . Canadian Gary Yates has written and directed a film that reminds us of the old days with the low lights and hard criminals , but in a comedy of cons conning cons . It may take a scorecard to figure out who is conning who , but viewers will be thrilled with the ending . Kevin Pollack ( The Usual Suspects ) and Liane Balaban lead this quirky and enjoyable film with a great supporting cast that will keep you guessing .
432352	2171244	4972	8.0	Dare we dream of a golden day when the bestial War shall rule no more .	It was an epic when it was made , and still a work of art in cinema history . The first part show the " gentile " South and the war . It was romanticized to the extent that brother was fighting brother , friend was fighting friend , and in meeting during the war , they remained friends . Nice , but probably not accurate . Still , it made for a good story . The second half is filled with controversy as the Carpetbaggers invade the South and establish Black rule that is designed to crush the Whites until the Golden Knights of the Ku Klux Klan save society to live in peace . This is the story as presented , not an interpretation . Despite the historical inaccuracy , it it still a magnificent work with amazing performances by Lillian Gish , Mae Marsh , Henry B . Walthall , George Siegmann , and others . It is hard to believe that words are not needed to display feelings .
433809	2171244	43278	8.0	You only find the right woman once .	Before they struck gold with Gigi , Vincente Minelli and Alan Jay Lerner teamed up to write and direct this other story of Paris and love . It didn't win nine Oscars , but it did win six out of eight nominations including Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , Color ; Best Cinematography ; Best Costume Design , Color ; Best Music , Scoring of a Musical Picture ; another Best Picture for Arthur Freed ; another screenplay award for Alan Jay Lerner ; a Best Director nomination for Vincente Minnelli ; and a Best Film Editing nomination . Leslie Caron was once again in the forefront of this film displaying her considerable dancing talents along with Gene Kelley who mesmerized us with his fancy footwork , and his singing alone and with Georges Guétary . Oscar-nominated Nina Foch ( Executive Suite ) thrilled us as the woman who kept artists . Great sets and a brilliant production number at the end , along with memorable tunes such as " Our Love Is Here To Stay " , " I Got Rhythm " , and " ' S Wonderful " .
433875	2171244	109348	8.0	She'll get some lines , or I'll nail your knee caps to the floor .	Let's face it . I am not a Woody Allen fan . So , I had to pick a movie that was written and directed by him , but I would not have to see or hear him . It was brilliant ! John Cusack was the right shade of neurotic as a director who had to get into bed with the mob to get his play on Broadway . And , who better to represent the mob than Joe Viterelli and Chazz Palminteri . Excellent choices . Jennifer Tilly was a real treat as the mob boss ' girlfriend who couldn't act . And , her relationship with Jim Broadbent was a gem . The movie was as funny as I expected a Woody Allen film to be and the shades of Sunset Boulevard with Dianne Wiest was captivating . There are so many little gems in this show that it would not be possible to repeat them here . You have to see them in context to enjoy them , and you should take the time to do just that .
433455	2171244	765443	8.0	He is no driver , he is the undertaker .	As Viggo Mortensen takes his character from A History of Violence to the next step , you can see the effort he put into the role by doing research before the film . Going to a remote village in Russia to learn the mannerisms and studying books to learn the meaning behind the tats really paid off as his character is so believable . His quiet persona constantly belies the machine that lies beneath . He is real and this performance is the apex of his career . That is not to take anything away from David Cronenberg , who had the good sense in using European actors who spoke both Russian and English to make the characters real . A stroke of genius . Vincent Cassel ( Crimson Rivers , Hate ) certainly is always enjoyable , and played the drunken son perfectly . Naomi Watts ( King Kong ) was better than I have ever seen her . Armin Mueller-Stahl made a great Godfather , right up there with Brando and Pacino . A thoroughly enjoyable film that will stand up to repeated viewings .
434075	2171244	26029	8.0	I know what it is to feel lonely and helpless and to have the whole world against me ,	I decided to visits a couple of classics last night and I started with the British Hitchcock movie . It was a few years after this film that he came to the United States , A career that spanned 50 years and some very fine films . This film reminded me of The Fugative . The basic premises are similar . A man is on the run after being accused of a murder he did not commit . He wasn't looking for a one-armed man , but for a spy . Of course , no one believed him and he stayed just a half-step ahead of the law . The climax is a little contrived , but Robert Donat ( Goodbye , Mr . Chips ) made a dashing fugitive , and Madeleine Carroll as the typical Hitchcock blond added humor to the film . A good introduction to the master of suspense .
433116	2171244	880502	8.0	Everything will become alright because you are joining the EU .	Considered one of the best films of last year , it won 19 awards , primarily for writer / direct Faith Akin's screenplay . It had some standout performances , especially from Tuncel Kurtiz as the drunken father Ali who manages to kill his live-in lover , Nursel Köse , in a drunken rage . She won a Turkish Golden Orange for her performance . Hanna Schygulla , who has won many awards , also got one from the National Film Critics for this one . After her death , with his father in prison , the son Nejat ( Baki Davrak ) goes to Turkey to find the daughter Ayten ( Nurgül Yesilçay ) . He runs smack dab into the Kurdish problem . As he is looking for her , she heads to Germany to find her mother . She meets Charlotte ( Patrycia Ziolkowska ) , who brings her home , much to Mommy's ( Schygulla ) dismay . After Ayten is arrested and deported back to Turkey , Charlotte follows . That loving between them must have been really special . Now two people are in Turkey looking to see her . I am curious how they will hook up , as I am sure they will . A casket left Germany for Turkey , now a casket leaves Turkey for Germany . Fathers and sons , mothers and daughters , Germans and Turks , they all find that maybe they are not so different and there is room for them to come together . They share sorrows and find similarities . It is a beautiful story told in a way that captivates you .
432764	2171244	416449	8.0	Made for the Big Screen	I kick myself frequently for missing Frank Miller's Sin City on the big screen . I wish they would bring films like that back occasionally . Well , I wasn't going to miss this one and I am glad I didn't . It was a beautiful and impressive film . It was no Sin City , but it was an enjoyable way to spend two hours on a Saturday morning . One is tempted to start reading something into the film . Maybe an allegory about freedom fighters sacrificing their lives against an imperialist machine with their coalition of the bought and paid for and impressive and fearsome weapons , but I will not get drawn into that . I will say that the story of the Spartans at Thermopylae was as exciting as the story of William Wallace in Braveheart . The scenes with the Oracle were stunning and sensuous and one wants to see more of Kelly Craig . The dialog was typical Hoo Rah and seriously detracted from my enjoyment . I really didn't think the blood and gore was anything you wouldn't find in a video game rated M . It was certainly a lot less than Saving Private Ryan . All-in-all a good film and nothing that teens couldn't see . It was really a PG13 .
432599	2171244	69834	8.0	There ain't nothing too late . . . if you love it .	There may be a lot of people that will dismiss this movie as just another example of John Wayne's typical western persona . If they do , they really didn't pay attention to what was being said throughout the film . In the 150 + hours of John Wayne movies on TV this week in honor of what would be his 100th birthday , this one is an excellent example , not only of his range as an actor , but also of his personal philosophy . You can dismiss John Wayne as just a cowboy actor , but you really don't know him if you do . He played a lot of different characters and showed variation in each one , even if it was just another western . In Cahill , he shows the struggle many fathers have gone through to raise their children and fulfill their responsibilities at the same time . Sometimes , it is difficult to appreciate how much of a struggle that is . Those of us who grew up with Depression-era fathers know that they just wanted to make sure that their children did not suffer as they did . Sometimes , that meant we felt fatherless as they were working all the time . This is very evident in this film . But one thing our fathers did manage to impart was duty and responsibility . You see that evident in every thing that Cahill does . He showed respect for women , regardless of race , he treated everyone the same . He emphasized the need to finish the job you agreed to do even if it caused you pain or hardship . There are many lessons in the film that would speak to all of us today . It is not done in a preachy way - it is just a natural part of the story . Sure , it's just another John Wayne western , but it is so much more if you take the time to really watch it . AMC and Encore Westerns , and TCM would all be doing us a favor to show this film every Father's Day .
433198	2171244	51554	8.0	Sleep well , Mr . Harker .	It just would not be Halloween with seen one of the Hammer Horror Films starring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing . And , what better one to watch than Dracula . Lee's Dracula is smooth and sophisticated and perfect for the role of a Count . When he bends over the beautiful but helpless woman , she doesn't need to be naked , as you see her breasts heave and the short bursts of breath right before his penetration . Makes me want to roll over and have a cigarette afterwards . Cushing is a magnificent Van Helsing , and he has a professional air about him that is quite endearing . He suffers fools as a gentleman . There may be argument over the nest Dracula , but this is certainly in the running .
434231	2171244	447544	8.0	Wetbacks - the other side of the coin	Wetback : The Undocumented Documentary is an excellent film by Arturo Pereze Torres and Heather Haynes . It shows the issue of immigration into the US from the side of the undocumented worker . We all know the side of the vigilantes . All we have to do is watch anyone on Fox to get that side . But , what do we really know about the other side . The Smoking Gun's expose of A Million Little Pieces showed us that what we think is true often isn't . Wetback shows us the poverty that drives workers across our borders . Poverty that causes them to literally risk life and limb to get something for their family . It also shows the gains to the US and other American countries from the undocumented workers in this country . But , it is really all about survival . Survival is what drives them to travel thousands of miles , facing Mexican police and gangs that rob and rape them , and the Border Patrol and the vigilantes in the US . Survival - something many of us have never faced and , hopefully , will not face . It is helpful to know the other side of the coin . I think it makes us a better person .
434382	2171244	102138	8.0	The military-industrial complex	Eisenhower warned us about the military-industrial complex . It was not well know at the time of Kennedy's presidency . Oliver Stone presents a long and confusing argument that it was behind Kennedy's assassination . The film show Keven Costner as Jim Garrson battling the US Government and it's cronies : the ultra-right-wing fanatics represented in the movie by Clay Shaw ( Tommy Lee Jones ) , some unidentified Cuban exiles and a former F . B . I . man named Guy Bannister ( Ed Asner ) . Also involved are various fringe types like David Ferrie ( Joe Pesci ) , a pilot for hire ; the small-time mobster Jack Ruby ( Brian Doyle Murray ) , and Oswald ( Gary Oldman ) , whose place in the conspiracy has become utterly mysterious by the time the movie ends . Garrison would have had an easier time convincing a jury today as the Iraq war is the very embodiment of the military-industrial complex . WhatStone suggests was behind Kennedy's death is business-as-usual in Washington . We start wars to sell bombs . It was unfortunate that Stone's film came up against The Silence of the Lambs , which cleared the table at the Academy Awards . He took home two , but lost four times that many . It was a great film to go back and see . It was a reminder of a different age . An age when the Judge , the lawyers , and the defendants sat there cooling smoking as the trial went on . Bizarre .
434011	2171244	465551	8.0	She's the one I have waited for .	This is one part horror film and partly a commentary of sociological events that are all to common in this country right now . After an almost exclusively male role as sexual predators , we hear more and more stories of female teachers who have prey upon children . Debra Lefebvre is in trouble again and Mary Kay Letourneau , Catherine Paul , and here in Florida , Jennifer Tarkenton was just arrested for having sex with a 14-year-old boy . She could have waited another couple of years as 16 is the age of consent in most states ( Males should teach in Iowa or South Carolina as 14 is legal - and we give these people preference in selecting our President ? ) See Cate Blanchett trapped in that scenario , we cannot feel sorry for her , but I can celebrate a dramatically outstanding performance . I can also experience some schadenfruede as she gets to be the prey in the horror portion of the film . Judi Dench was also magnificent as the predator who sought out young women to satisfy her lusts . No laws broken , but she was scary as hell in a Dracula role . Kudos also to Bill Nighy as the suffering husband . Super performance .
433269	2171244	249380	8.0	Thelma & Louise for grownups	This was not one of the infamous video nasties , but it is nonetheless a nasty video . The sex is raw and the violence is in-your-face , just like the title , which was translated into " Rape Me " in the US , but is more appropriately " Fck Me . " I noted that it was supposedly banned in it's home country , France , and it was certainly banned in other countries like Australia or heavily cut . Do not think for one moment that it was banned for sex or violence . It was banned because of the depiction of men in the film , not a single one with any redeeming social values . It is a hard film to take because all the men in it are pigs . It is based upon a novel by Virginie Despentes who , with Coralie wrote and directed this film . This is a women's film about women's rage . If this is the way women really feel when they are pssed , then you better be warned . It open with a rape that leaves nothing to the imagination . There is no doubt about the pain being felt . One of the victims , and another woman who just saw her friend killed , join together in an adventure across France . It becomes more and more violent as they go on . Not cartoonish , like Natural Born Killers , but raw violence ; uncaring , unmerciful , and brutal . The sex is real , but it is like nothing you see in porn films . The sex is driven by the women's needs , it shows the vulnerability of men during orgasm , and the men are discarded like used tissues , if they are not killed , when the women have been satisfied . They even have a Thelma and Louise plan to die together by jumping off a cliff . Circumstances do not allow that to happen , and the ending is rather abrupt and somewhat lacking . Men joke about PMS , but if it is anything like the rage depicted by the women who made this film , you better watch out . This rage is nothing to joke about .
434446	2171244	174707	8.0	Poor people can't survive , so they have to kill their babies .	It is hard to believe that this film was made in 1974 as it mirrors the circumstances of the US in the last 16 years . The abortion rate under Clinton's Presidency was lower than under the Bush administration . Why the difference ? Read the quote above . If the poor can't buy rice , they don't have more children . This all comes out as Hanzo ( Shintarô Katsu ) is investigating the death of a woman after an abortion . This investigation leads him Monk-style to a Temple where young girls are sold to wealthy businessmen for torture and rape , with an abortion business on the side . He captures the Priestess and tortures her before using the Hanzo technique to get her to talk . His investigation is delayed while he is assigned to find Japan's greatest thief , who rapes and murders his victims . The thief is heading toward Hanzo's village . he hides in the mint to snare him . While there he manages to gather further evidence against the person benefiting from the Temple . A big showdown with many dead at the hands of his sword , and both thieves are captured in fine Hanzo fashion . Can't wait for the next adventure .
432461	2171244	75214	8.0	A rollicking great action yarn ( that was true ! )	The first thing you notice about this film is the racist MPAA . Despite it being rated PG for war violence , there was nudity . Breasts were exposed , but they weren't those of Barbara Parkins ( " Peyton Place " , Valley of the Dolls , and her skintastic moment in Breakfast in Paris ) , but of African natives . Seems that black breasts are not taboo for children to see . But , to the film itself . It is actually two films . The first half in 1912 , has Lee Marvin ( Cat Ballou , Paint Your Wagon ) as a drunken ivory poacher who manages to get Roger Moore ( The Spy Who Loved Me , " The Saint " ) to partner up with him . After Moore and Parkins ( Marvin's daughter ) plan to marry , there is a great fight scene reminiscent of many John Wayne pictures . Then the film changes . World War I is declared and the Germans are on the march led by Reinhard Kolldehoff ( Moon Over Parador , " The Winds of War " ) , a big fat German pig whose men slaughter Moore and Parkins baby , and set them on a search for revenge . The film has plenty of action , including what I would call a paper mache bi-plane which almost takes Moore's life , and culminates in the blowing up of a German battleship that had run over Moore and Marvin earlier . Marvin was extremely funny and Moore looked just great painted black to get on the ship . Parkins was radiant throughout , even when consumed with revenge for the murder of her baby . Sir Ian Holm ( Chariots of Fire ) was also fantastic as Marvin's mute servant .
434328	2171244	109688	8.0	The root of man's problems is memory .	Most viewers of this film will know the back story . Kar Wai Wong ( 2046 ) collected pieces of his 1994 film Ashes of Time and remastered them to make this film . The first thing you notice is the magnificent cast : Maggie Cheung ( 2046 , Hero ) , Tony Leung Chiu Wai ( Lust , Caution , Hero , Infernal Affairs III ) , and Tony Leung Ka Fai ( Zhou Yu's Train ) . A hint of excellence to come . Christopher Doyle's cinematography is the next thing to capture your attention . While the area is in the midst of a drought and it is desert , it is painted in a way that draws you into the scene . It is simply a visually stunning film from the opening to the end . The swordplay was a dance of magic and added to the film , but was not the central focus . It was love , lust , betrayal , vengeance , pain and yearning that was displayed beautifully by the magnificent actors to a soft and stirring soundtrack . We want to remember ; we want to forget . The seasons come and go as does our lives .
434206	2171244	70917	8.0	You'll simply never understand the true nature of sacrifice .	An absolutely outstanding film and way superior to the remake , Edward Woodward , who went on to do " The Equalizer " ten years after this , was brilliant as Sergeant Howie , a devout Christian who was absolutely shocked at the goings on on the island . The best part was when he was mesmerized by Willow's ( Britt Ekland ) sensuous dance in the adjoining room . He couldn't deal with the copious nudity and symbols of sex all around him . Christopher Lee was also extremely good as Lord Summerisle and lay a brilliant trap that we are all familiar with . Ingrid Pitt also gave great delight when Sergeant Howie was searching the village . The music was captivating and the whole scene was perfect for the story .
432225	2171244	893356	9.0	The inhumanity of war	I watch movies for two reasons : to be entertained , and to be informed . This is one of the most informative movies that I have ever seen . The actions of the Japanese soldiers in 1937 as they invaded China was on a par with many of the atrocities that we have seen in our lifetime in Bosnia , Darfur , etc . It is a story that will stick with you for a long time . This is the story of a handful of foreigners who stayed behind as others fled and tried to save as many Chinese as they could . They saved over 250 , 000 by setting up a safe zone . Another 200 , 000 were killed and 20 , 000 women , between 12 and 60 , were raped by the Japanese soldiers . The Japanese killed all young men just because they may be soldiers . They gang raped every night as many women as they could . It was an atrocity that clearly shows the level to which soldiers go in time of war . It is easy to commit these heinous crimes when you look upon the enemy as gooks , or nips , or chinks . A powerful film that should be seen by everyone .
432344	2171244	65234	9.0	Make war on corruption and liberalism and on indiscriminate liberty .	For all those who do not realize that the US government loves dictators as long as they are anti-communist ( leaves Fidel out ) , and as long as they do what they are told ( sorry Saddam ) , this true life depiction is a must-see . It doesn't say Greece , but it is , under the rule of The Colonels . The Government tried to keep the film out of the US , but it was nominated for several Oscars and , while Midnight Cowboy took away the Best Picture and Best Director honors , it won the Oscar , the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film , and the critics picked it as Best Film and named Costa-Gavras Best Director . Scenes in the streets were like the fascists that invaded the vote counting in South Florida in 2000 . Student protesters were beaten by angry mobs supporting the military junta . On 22 May 1963 , after delivering the keynote speech at an anti-war meeting in Thessaloniki , two far-right extremists ( Yago & Vago in the film ) driving a kamikazi , struck Grigoris Lambrakis with a club over the head in plain view of the police and a large number of people . He suffered brain injuries and died in the hospital five days later , on 27 May . This was depicted in the film and Grigoris Lambrakis , simply called The Deputy in the film , was played by Yves Montand . The result was the eventual downfall of the junta . It was the Magistrate played brilliantly by Jean-Louis Trintignant ( Best Actor at Cannes ) that uncovered the plot to kill Lambrakis . They say it can't happen here , and maybe no one was murdered , but people were imprisoned without access to lawyers and courts during the eight year rule of Bush . We need to be aware of what happens when the power is in the hands of the Government , and not the people . The film featured the fantastic music of Mikis Theodorakis ( Zorba the Greek , Serpico ) .
432628	2171244	382932	9.0	Ah , but that is no match for wishful thinking . If you focus on what you left behind . You will never be able to see what lies ahead . Now go up and look around .	I , of course , will be biased in my review of this film . As a food lover , I can relate well to Remy and his search for food that explodes in your mouth with taste . Brad Bird and Jan Pinkava have created one of the funniest movies I have seen - and it stars a rat ! How anyone can make a rat appealing is beyond me , but they have done it . The story flows as if it starred real humans , but the fact that it is animated makes it even more appealing . It has constant humor amidst the deviousness of the chef . Along with that , we get a very positive message about challenging ourselves to keep pushing the envelope . It is not just a cartoon for kiddies , but an enjoyable film for all ages . It should definitely have a sequel .
433726	2171244	39628	9.0	It wouldn't be Christmas without this movie	It just wouldn't be Christmas if I didn't see this film . I never get tired of watching it . Edmund Gwenn was fantastic as Santa and got a well-deserved Academy Award for his performance . This would have been the Best Picture of 1947 , had it not come up against Gentleman's Agreement . The supporting cast was also excellent . Maureen O'Hara , John Payne , young Natalie Wood , and William Frawley all gave performances that make this picture one that cannot be duplicated . Don't buy into those remakes . The original black and white with a cast that can't be topped is the one to watch . This is a movie for the kid in all of us and we better not forget that magic . Besides , it divulged " The Secret " long before the current bunch . " I believe . I believe "
432422	2171244	113247	9.0	Hate breeds hate !	Hubert ( Hubert Koundé ) : Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper ? On his way down past each floor , he kept saying to reassure himself : So far so good . . . so far so good . . . so far so good . How you fall doesn't matter . It's how you land ! Society is in free fall . There have been at least 300 " accodental " deaths at the hands of the French police . The current President of France considers the minorities in France to be " scum . " This is the story of three of these minority youth and 24 hours in their life after another was murdered by a French policeman . Mathieu Kassovitz ( Crimson Rivers , Gothika ) has directed a masterpiece showing the youth that are alienated from their parents with their love of rap music and American films , and a culture that is alienated from those in society that are consumed with their incomes , and cars , and fancy houses . The film stars three fantastic actors : Vincent Cassel ( Ocean's Twelve & Thirteen , Crimson Rivers , Brotherhood of the Wolf ) , Hubert Koundé ( The Constant Gardener ) , and Saïd Taghmaoui ( The Kite Runner , Hildago ) . Watching 24 hours in their search for meaning was both funny and sad . Considering that they represent thousands all over the world makes you cry . The photography by Pierre Aïm was magnificent . " The peacemakers , those who are supposed to spread democracy and justice on behalf of our sate and self-satisfied societies , are spreading death , contempt , racism , and humiliation . They are creating a world of hate . " - - Costa Gravas This is an important film that will stand the test of time ; a classic that will remind us of what we are doing ; and a warning to change direction .
432567	2171244	381681	9.0	Life is what happens when you are making other plans	I am so in love with Celine . She is the perfect woman - caring concerned , intelligent - I could listen to her forever . And , take her and put Juile Delpy's voice into her and i am in heaven . Delpy ( Hoax , Broken Flowers ) turns in an enchanting performance with Ethan Hawke ( Training Day ) , as two lovers who lost each other nine years ago and meet again in Paris . It is obvious from the start that Jesse ( Hawke ) has never went a day without regretting what happened . Celine appears to shrug it off but , no matter how hard she tries , it comes out that her life has also been affected . The entire film is a conversation between the two that says so much . I know the century is young , but this is definitely one of the best films so far . Director Richard Linklater ( screenplay / story ) , Julie Delpy ( screenplay ) , Ethan Hawke ( screenplay ) , and Kim Krizan ( story ) have written a wonderful film that will stand the test of time .
432549	2171244	486655	9.0	An enchanting experience	I really had no idea what to expect out of this movie . It was billed to me as a " chick flick , " but with enough eye-candy to keep the guys interested . Boy , were they wrong . The movie is simply enchanting and a deep story about love and all it should mean . Claire Danes has somehow escaped my notice until now , but after her fantastic performance in this film , I am going to be looking for more of her . Michelle Pfeiffer was simply wonderful as the witch and really gave a great performance in every scene . And , Robert De Niro . Just what can I say about his gender-bending performance ? He was a real pleasure to watch . The whole movie was hilarious , with jokes just spread throughout . It was just what you want from a fantasy film . You can have your hobbits , I'll take Danes , Pfeiffer , Kate Magowan , and Sienna Miller anytime .
432622	2171244	1078188	9.0	I ain't that boy ! I ain't that boy !	Andrew Garfield was magnificent as Jack , who was trying to live a normal life after serving 14 years for a murder committed as a boy . Everything seems to be going great . He has a job and a girlfriend ( Katie Lyons ) , and he even performed a heroic act saving a little girl . But , all good things must come to an end . His secret is discovered , as one would expect . But , how it came out was a huge surprise . Peter Mullan ( Session 9 , Trainspotting ) was also excellent as the mentor who tried to help Jack . John Crowley has established himself as a great director with this film . It was really a thoughtful and beautiful story .
434597	2171244	427312	10.0	Why would you want to do this ?	Now , why would anyone want to live with grizzlies ? I keep driving down the roads near where I live and hope one day to spot a Florida black bear , but I have no intention of moving to the Ocala Forest and have them looking in my window . I leave that to the Rainbow people and those who are avoiding society for some reason - maybe because they have meth labs in their kitchen . But , for 13 years , Treadwell spent his summers with the grizzlies . This was his mission in life - a life that was scarred by alcohol and drug abuse . He found some peace in the wilderness and overcame his addictions . That's great , but you are still living with grizzlies ! The footage he left us was tremendous , and it certainly added to the film and made it a pleasurable experience , but , make no mistake , this film is not about grizzlies , but about Treadwell . He was an interesting character , and I do mean he was a character in every sense of the word . I would not doubt that he was probably bi-polar and , had he been on meds , would not have done this . But , like many of us , the level feeling produced by meds is not the personality we wish to exhibit and so we quit them . I was fascinated by his paranoia at the end . At one point he used the F-word so many times ( hence , the " R " rating ) that I thought I was watching Tony Montana in Scarface . It was a great film and certainly deserving of the numerous awards given to it and to the director , Werner Herzog . If I was not already rooting for March of the Penguins , I would hope it won an Oscar . Maybe it will at least get a nomination .
434209	2171244	1280627	10.0	Exceeded all expectations	I know back in the day when I listened to Air America that Rachel Maddow was something special . She impressed me then as someone who had a keen grasp of what was happening and could translate it into terms that anyone could understand . I believe that it is not only her impressive academic credentials that contribute to this , but a serious work ethic that causes her to do copious research on a subject . This was evident as I watched her tonight . She knew her stuff ! She is a charming personality that makes the news worth watching . The mainstream media on every evening during dinner can learn a lot from her . So , skip Charlie and Brian and Katie , and get you news from Rachel . You will be a better informed American .
433725	2171244	315733	10.0	Film Magic	2004 was a great year for films . This was one of the very best . Don't just take my word for it ; look at the 27 nominations and 20 wins it took . Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu must have been practicing for Babel . They have a similar style of telling three interlocking stories , but Babel flowed a little more smoothly that 21 Grams . That is not a criticism of this film . You need to invest your time to follow along . It takes a little more work than most movie goers are used to , but it is worth it . I got distracted the first time I tried and had to stop and start all over . I'm glad I did . The acting by Sean Penn , Benicio Del Toro , and Naomi Watts was over the top . All three put in first-class performances to tell a story that was intense from start to finish . What can I say that all the film critics have not said ? Invest your time in this film to see great actors and a great director work magic .
