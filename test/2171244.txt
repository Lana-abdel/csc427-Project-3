434374	2171244	87617	1.0	What a stinking ripoff !	I bought this movie with Denzel Washington on the cover and a title of License to Kill . It even says " full screen " and the back said " unrated . " Well , it was unrated all right , because it was a TV movie and Denzel Washington had a minor part in it . All I can say that Denzel must have had some time to kill before he started A Soldier's Story and made this in a day . It was certainly a complete ripoff by Echo bridge Home Entertainment to package the trash as it did and take my money . It should be sold at the dollar store for a buck . It was a Lifetime movie , pure and simple , and there is nothing I can say that is worse that that . These people ripped me off .
434208	2171244	83185	2.0	I watched it so you don't have to .	Out on video at last ! One of the original video nasties that were banned by Britain . It was finally released uncut in 2003 . Obviously , the Brits don't like cannibal movies as they banned five of them . This film was really bad on so many levels . It seemed as if time and distance were totally disregarded . For example , Monsieur Danville ( Olivier Mathot ) left for three days and seemed to come back in 30 minutes . The jungle must have been in Southern Spain , as it took everyone so little time to get there . If you are looking for titillating scenes , there is only one : Pamela Stanford taking a bath . Other than that the rest focused mainly on the eating of people's guts . Yech ! They really didn't need to ban this as it is too awful to watch .
433540	2171244	147507	3.0	Wake me when it's over .	When is a Limited Collector's Edition 2-Disc Set not a bargain ? When one of the movies is this one . Ronnie Sortor wrote , directed , edited and acted in this low budget indie flick . He also uses the same cast in all his movies , so if you like them in this film , they will likely be in another . Unfortunately , I couldn't find anything to like about any of them . Action got hot an heavy for a couple of minutes during the robbery , but then it died . Too many shots of actors just standing there supposedly thinking . The worst part of it all was the dude with a gut shot . Now , I have never had a gut shot , but i would imagine it to be very difficult to be running through the woods , and up and down stairs in a house with a bullet in my gut . Just seems stretching things for me , and it really bugged me throughout the film to see the guy doing it .
433986	2171244	290657	3.0	Get your spirits in a bottle .	The worst terror I can imagine is having Playboy model Beverly Lynne on top of me and then have her turn into some crone dressed as a nun . That would scare the hell out of me ! But , that is what happened in David's ( Charlie David ) dream . It seems that he and Julie ( Lynne ) moved into a haunted house - haunted by a nun ! Why ? We never find out in this film that really turns into a bore . Their friends come over that night and basically just get drunk and make fools of themselves . The killer nun is getting rid of them one by one in what can only be described as very amateur gore . There is hardly a quart of blood used in the whole film , and that includes a shower scene with Lynne where she imagines blood flowing all over her . We have Jennifer Amanda Morgan , a very hot Yvette Lopez , and Lindsey Labrum all at the party and we have zero action . What a bummer ! If you want to see has over 60 appearances that seem to over good possibilities . Films like Kinky Sex Club , Bikini Chain Gang , and Emmanuelle Tango . Check those out and leave this one alone .
432253	2171244	70393	3.0	Italian cops and robbers	I sure that fans of Hostel Part II this year paid no attention to the Italian detective ( Luc Merenda ) in the film . He was part of the Italian trend in the 70s to make movies that followed the trend of Dirty Harry and The French Connection . In this film , a man's movie to say the least , he was a cop that had no hesitation in killing criminals even when they had their hands up . He went undercover and participated in a robbery where an innocent got killed . Not a problem as his goal was to get Mr . Big . Of course , like Dirty harry , that meant anyway he could regardless of procedure . The DVD was of particular poor quality - the interior lighting was terrible . Except for two really good car chases , there isn't much to recommend this film .
434098	2171244	95882	3.0	Oh Thrill !	The only thing that saved this from a total waste was the presence of Leslie Easterbrook , who made two very interesting points throughout the entire film . I especially liked her " Ride of the Valkyries " yell as she sped up in the swamp boat . Of course , parts of her arrived long before the boat . I was glad to see her return as well as G . W . Bailey along with the regulars : Bubba Smith , David Graf , Michael Winslow Leslie Easterbrook , and George Gaynes . Most of the movie was unfortunately focused on Easterbrook's breasts and Bailey's bumbling attempts at gaining attention . Tackleberry was funny as usual with his over-the-top gung-ho attitude . But really not worth the time .
433988	2171244	182996	3.0	Now I've got you , bitch !	One of the 74 video nasties banned in Britain , this film was released in 2007 uncut . One would have to question why it was banned in the first place , unless the film board just wanted to save viewers from a bad film . I really felt I should get a Merit Badge after having to listen to the lectures of surviving in the woods while waiting for something exciting to happen . The electronic music was irritating at times , but the scenery was sure beautiful . I bet that artist didn't plan to have so much red in her painting . Lots of bodies pile up as the psycho killer in the woods tromps on . Not much gore , just blood .
433238	2171244	148719	3.0	A real load of crap	Another entry from the golden age of sexploitation ( 1965-1968 ) . A real load of crap . I can't believe people actually paid money to watch this . Three brothers start a skin mag and one of them slowly goes crazy with guilt . Something like Reefer Madness . There was so little sexploitation in this it was unbelievable . After one brother tries to have sex with his wife , the crazy one kills him . He ends up killing his other brother , too . If this is what passed for entertainment in the sixties , they were really hard up . They would have been better off watching an Ed Wood production .
434182	2171244	461788	3.0	Don't waste your time	This was so bad that If it hadn't included a hot tub scene with Jennifer Hill , it would have been one of the worst movies of all time . It has a good monster in The Ice Queen , but she was wasted with her incessant screaming , and the set just didn't allow her to really develop . The battle with Audrey ( Tara Walden ) was set up for a promising scene , but it just didn't develop . There was really no one you could care about in this film . It really didn't matter who came out . The pair that did were probably the least likable . Despite giving us her all in that hot tub , Elaine ( Hill ) didn't fare too well .
434166	2171244	382625	4.0	Did that old cannabis charge finally catch up with me ?	Do you love a good mystery / thriller ? How about one that is supposedly based on fact ? How about one that takes place in Paris and the UK ? If you do , then this film has every thing you could be looking for in a movie . Ron Howard and Tom Hanks had an impossible job . Making a credible film on the tail of a hugely successful book . They managed to make a film that was interesting and exciting , and it had a great score , and superb sound and visual effects . Yes , I read the book , and I even knew about the Templars and Opus Dei before I read the book . I also read the book that The DaVinci Code was based upon . I knew the premises and that did not spoil the book for me , just as reading the book did not spoil the movie . Tom Hanks did a great job , Ron Howard did a great job , Audrey Tautou was delicious , and , of course , Sir Ian was fantastic .
432989	2171244	329774	4.0	Wars come and go , but my soldier stay eternal .	He's no Vin Diesel , but Ice Cube gives a credible performance in a predictable action flick . Samuel L . Jackson is back as the boss , and Willem Dafoe is the bad guy , a part he plays well . She is no Asia Argento , but Nona Gaye provided the eye candy for the movie . I imagine that Gaye got the part in The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions that was to go to Aaliyah before her untimely death . This is a perfect movie for those who like to hear a lot of rappers . Unfortunately , the action sequences just keep getting more and more unbelievable until they come to a crescendo with a out of this world train sequence . Come back , Vin !
433962	2171244	94620	4.0	Zombi 4 : Watching it is like death	This one is really a snooze-fest after the great ones I saw this weekend . It starts with a High priest who calls on the zombies to come from hell and exact revenge for the death of his daughter . The last thing we see is a little girl running away as her parents are killed . In the very next scene the little girl ( Candice Daly ) is back with some mercenaries and some dumb woman that is cruising through the jungle in a skirt and heels . What's up with that ? And how about the hero trying to light twenty candles with a bic . Have you ever lit a candle with a bic ? Good luck lighting one without burning your fingers ! Meanwhile , some expedition is trying to find out what happened years ago . They also have a dumb woman that whines constantly . Why did you come along ? I do have to say that the makeup was very good . This had one of the most butt-ugly zombies I have ever saw . Kudos to Franco Di Girolamo . This is only recommended for hard-core zombie fans .
433973	2171244	430334	4.0	Another chance to see Christa .	OK , I am consumed with Christa Campbell . I have read and reread this month's Playboy feature on her . OK , I mainly looked at the pictures . I even ran down to get Scars when it came out to see her one picture in it . She is a MySpace friend and I cannot wait until her new film is out on DVD next month and the 2001 Maniacs sequel comes out next year . I am so obsessed that i would watch this movie just to catch a glimpse at her . But , I stuck with it until the end because it was interesting . I do live in Florida , so I thought I might get a tip on how to kill mosquitoes . No , the bug zapper doesn't work in real life . I did get to see three things : One of the most ugly creatures I have ever seen in a horror movie - I mean I hate those things at actual size , why would anyone want to see one seven foot tall . Ugh ! Two , they used buckets of blood in this film . There was some real carnage in the hospital scenes . You were totally unprepared as the prior scenes were relatively mild . And , three , Musetta Vander is hot . She was a siren in O Brother , Where Art Thou ? , but I didn't know here name . She has only been in two other pieces of crap that I have seen , so I didn't really notice her as I was retching . Not a great movie , but not a total waste either .
434201	2171244	257516	4.0	There's no such thing as safe sex with a werewolf .	Big whoop ! This was a real disappointment for a werewolf film . Safe sex ? There was NO sex . I mean the beast can tear a woman in half , but she still keeps her top . The lovely Mya ( Chicago ) was attacked , wasn't she ? We wouldn't know because we didn't see . And , this was the " Unrated " version . Christina Ricci is always a joy , but she spent most of the movie running around with her brother in denial . And , this whole " gay " thing ; what a joke . This movie was a ripoff from start to finish and it is a shame that Wes Craven put his name on it . A kid could watch it without being scared . very little blood and only one quick gross out . Portia de Rossi , who gets top billing was in it for , what ? , two minutes . Lame .
432965	2171244	49092	4.0	While I live , while my blood burns hot , your daughter is not safe in her tent .	The John Wayne marathon . Now , this is real Grindhouse fare . the lines in this film are comparable to such classics as Satan's black Wedding or Diary of a Nymph . John Wayne as Ghengis Khan ! I would not waste time talking about this film as i don't recommend anyone seeing it , but there is an interesting story behind it . It was filmed in Utah . The military had been doing atomic bomb testing near the location before the film , and the area was still hot . Several of the people involved with the film - over 100 - died of cancer . I kid you not : John Wayne : lung & stomach cancer , Susan Hayward : brain cancer , Pedro Armendáriz : suicide , after learning he had cancer , Agnes Moorehead : uterine cancer , and John Hoyt : lung cancerTose were main characters . The rest of the deaths were crew .
433930	2171244	439238	4.0	Bound to cause boredom	There are two classes of people who will love this film - Stephen Baldwin fans and Gladys Jimenez fans . All others are bound to be bored . Baldwin plays a cop ( Max Garrett ) who is dangerously close to being kicked out . He is assigned to watch Laura ( Kristy Swanson ) and protect her from a crazed killer . You'll know who the killer is in the first five minutes , so there are only two questions to be answered : will the killer get Laura , and will Baldwin get Swanson , who continues to remain nudity-free after 55 films . Well , there is a third question that begs to be answered : why the heck would Garrett want Swanson when he has Gladys Jimenez at home ? She has no problems showing us what made her famous in films like Blowback and Secrets of a Chambermaid . She gave that up to become a soap star , but we get another view in this film . We know that Garrett is not gay like we suspect Dr . Doolittle is , but he certainly has his priorities crossed . Get home , jerk , Jimenez is waiting !
434448	2171244	56528	5.0	Drive that stake between those heaving bosoms !	One would imagine that this film came out of those pocket books so popular with the ladies . It is a Gothic romance from start to finish with sumptuous sets , heaving bosoms and formal attire . Graziella Granata is absolutely gorgeous even in black and white , and she falls into the vampire's ( Dieter Eppler ) trap immediately . Here husband ( Walter Brandi ) is absolutely clueless at what is happening right under his nose . Don't worry , the fearless doctor knows what he is dealing with and chases the vampire and his minions to extinction - or , based on current HBO programming - to Louisiana .
433480	2171244	87797	5.0	You're going to ruin Christmas forever .	Once upon a time there were three little girls who went to the police academy - two in Los Angeles , the other in San Francisco - and they were each assigned very hazardous duties . But one married a geologist and his company was dynamiting near North Pole City . Now she works for me . My name is Santa . A new assignment for the former member of " Charlies Angels . " Jaclyn Smith has to save Christmas from the greedy oilman , Mason Adams , from " Lou Grant . " Her husband played by Paul Le Mat ( American graffiti , Melvin and Howard ) doesn't believe she met Santa . He doesn't really care about anything but bringing in that oil for his boss . Art Carney ( Harry and Tonto , " The Honeymooners " ) is Santa , who really doesn't do much other than moan about the dynamiting that will destroy North Pole City . In fact , no one does much in this film , and no one really save Christmas . It just so happens that they discovered oil seconds before they were going to destroy Santa's home . But , what the heck , we don't watch these films for great acting . They are just for fun and to get into the spirit .
434036	2171244	397044	5.0	Unless , of course , you'd rather be buried here , as a ceiling fan or something .	Although I was disappointed in this film for the most part , it had some parts that were really good . I can't give it a recommendation as a horror film . I would have never watched it had I know it was another Twilight . I am not interested in horror stories for tweens . Whether vampires or werewolves , these stories demand an R rating to be credible . I am not interested in Romeo and Juliet for the wolf set . The transformation into wolves in the forest was incredible , and the best part of the movie . The second best part was when Rafe died . Agnes Bruckner ( The Peaceful Warrior , The Woods ) was worth seeing again .
432390	2171244	100514	5.0	If you want a guarantee , buy a toaster .	You've seen it all before . There just aren't any new ways to tell the story of the veteran cop and the rookie . Even Clint Eastwood has done it before as Harry Callahan . So , if you like Clint Eastwood ( starred and directed ) and Charlie Shhen , then maybe this is worth your time . I tuned in for a chance to see Raul Julia and Sonia Braga . This is at least the fourth film they have done together , and they are all worth watching . It isn't Moon Over Parador or Kiss of the Spider Woman or The Burning Season , all of which got Braga and Julia Golden Globe nominations , and one actual win for Julia , but they are so good together , I just can't miss the chance to see them . So , I'll watch another veteran-rookie film where I know the ending before it even gets started . I'm just a sucker that way .
432460	2171244	60588	5.0	A tribute to a popinjay !	If this was supposed to be an epic war movie , it failed miserably . I was really hoping to see the defeat of the rebels in Sudan , much as one would hope for the defeat of the Janjaweed and the rescue of Darfur . I was sorely disappointed . The photography was magnificent , the music excellent , and the battles that were fought were impressive , but you are talking about 10 % of the time spent on this film . The rest of the time was Charleton Heston just talking . he had nothing to back up his talk and was relying on rescue from the British Army . What a few hundred soldiers were going to defeat a rebel army of 20 , 000 ? Laurence Oliver was unrecognizable in makeup and a beard , but you could see the power of his acting in every word and gesture . he was magnificent . Not worth the time invested .
433157	2171244	397105	5.0	Why did they make this movie ?	There was nothing special about this movie . Dirty cops and mobsters and murdered prostitutes and crooked politicians have all be in many movies and at the same time . There just wasn't any reason for this movie to be made , especially considering that it was made so badly . Austin Pendleton ( A Beautiful Mind , The Notorious Bettie Page ) was just about the most evil mobster I have ever seen . There just wasn't a good bone in his body . He seriously seemed to enjoy being evil . I have to admit he was fun to watch , but it still didn't make the movie worthwhile . Georgian actress Nutsa Kukhianidze was also good and I fully intend to look for more of her films ( The Good Thief , A Trip to Karabakh ) . Tip for filmmakers : If your film is going to be crap and you are going to get an R rating , make it truly worth an R .
433669	2171244	36307	5.0	Feets don't fail me now	Poor John Carradine . He made a fatal mistake in thinking that he could turn his wife into a zombie and that she would obey his every command . Even dead , the wife is always right . Carradine starred as Dr . Max Heinrich von Altermann , a NAZI scientist that was trying to develop an army that would not have to eat and would be impervious to bullets for Hitler's army . He should have stuck to men and not tried to use his wife to prove his success . It proved his undoing . The film also featured the famous Mantan Moreland who , when he wasn't sniffing after the lovely Sybil Lewis , was engaging in the oft criticized stereotypical behavior that he was famous for , including the famous line " feet don't fail me now . "
433659	2171244	71675	5.0	Hunting and killing babies doesn't seem to be my specialty .	The first of a trilogy by Larry Cohen , and apparently he wants a do-over as this film is currently in post-production , having been remade with a new cast , and probably scarier effects . It's scary enough as Frank and Lenore ( John P . Ryan and Sharon Farrell have a baby that is a little bit abnormal . Frank tries to kill his baby , but has a change of heart at the last minute . This is truly a baby only a parent could love , and they do . I remember Ryan back from Death Wish 4 : The Crackdown , as some wacky drug dealer . he is a little more controlled in this film , and it is a fair watch .
433542	2171244	143874	5.0	For those who like Hitchcock	One of the the things you can do as a new director is to get a great Director of Photography . He can help you avoid mistakes and save your butt . Raoul Ruiz is not a new director , he has over 90 films to his credit , but he is fairly new to the United States . This is supposed to be his " official " debut film . So , he gets Robby Müller to do the cinematography . Great choice , as directors like Wim Wenders ( 13 times , including Paris Texas ) and Jim Jarmunch ( Ghost Dog , Way of the Samauri ) like to use him on their pictures . Unfortunately , the great cinematography and a sexy star , Anne Parillaud ( La Femme Nikita , Innocent Blood ) , can't make up for lousy music and bad " B " movie dialog , even if the story is somewhat interesting . Yes , I hung in there to see what happens , and , no , I am still not sure . It did have Graham Greene ( Die Hard with a Vengeance , The Green Mile ) and that made it more palatable through the bad parts . Don't rent , but you may want to catch it on cable .
432705	2171244	479125	5.0	Village of the 30 Days of Night	You have all probably seen this before . No , you have seen this before . If you have seen Village / Children of the Damned , there is no difference . A few hours vs . 10 years . Same thing . Once the children come out of their coma , then it is more 30 days of Night as they are zombified ( not zombies as they never really died ) and they start killing off everyone . The violence escalates as they learn to anticipate and use weapons . I thought James Van Der Beek did a fairly good job , and I also liked Ivana Milicevic . Tom definitely redeemed himself as everyone could certainly empathize with his actions that sent him to prison .
432503	2171244	117420	5.0	Waste of time	I don't know why I gave up the only show I enjoy on TV to watch this . It was Van Damme , and it was his directoral debut . I was just curious . Well , you know what they say about curiosity . They seemed to spend an interminable amount of time getting to the action in this remake of Bloodsport . When they got there , it did not seem as if Van Damme thought we were there to see some fighting . The matches were almost an afterthought . Was this in deference to Roger Moore ? Were they trying to make his role seem more important than it was ? James Remar and Janet Gunn - boring ! Everything about this movie just said payday .
433778	2171244	462338	6.0	It is your moment to be clean .	There is a great story in there somewhere , I just had difficulty finding it . Lasse Hallström's direction was lacking , in my humble opinion , and the story of the greatest hoax in publishing appeared disjointed . I was drawn to the film for one simple reason , much as I imagine many were drawn to see Richard Gere , to see Julie Delpy . She had an extremely small role as Nina Van Pallandt , but that was still the juiciest part of the film . Richard Gere and Alfred Molina were spectacular in their performances , and that is what makes the film worth watching . Gere as Clifford Irving was extremely fascinating and a perfect choice to play a smooth con man . Molina , as his friend and co-conspirator , was equally fascinating as he look as if he would have a heart attack at any moment . To think that this could have went as far as it did is incredible , and anyone wanting to see a piece of 70s history done by fine actors should give it a go .
433946	2171244	70547	6.0	I am , in my own fashion , also a lady of the night .	This movie has as much life as the Countess's zombie housekeeper . Even Rosalba Neri's hot body couldn't get things exciting . But . then the housekeeper ( Rosalba Neri ) bathes the Countess in hot blood , and it gets a little steamier . But , the real deal in this Italian classic is Dracula's ring . With it , the Countess summons young maidens from the village to fulfill her needs . She is a real hero to me in that she doesn't seek power or glory or riches , just young maidens to frolic with before she drinks and bathes in their blood . Bwa ha ha ha . And it's not just a single serving for the Countess , she orders in a five-pack , then does the funky chicken , and , voilà , 10 perfect breasts , extra spicy Italian-style . Yum . Now , she must just avoid the evil Herr Schiller ( Mark Damon ) , who wants to take her hand for his own purposes . They don't make them like this anymore .
432533	2171244	342295	6.0	Here's a treat for you .	One cannot imagine Troma making a family film , but here it is . Don't pay attention to the image of Toxie in the logo , this is a kid-friendly pic . The main doggie , Lucky , looks just like my Muffins . Of course , we are here to see Roxy , voiced by Debbie Rochon . Lucky took to Roxy right away . It seemed like he was trying to get underneath to see her boobs . Lots of sing alongs for the kiddies . This was a fun pic and you will not get tired of watching - I mean your kids will not get tired of watching . Hey ! It's educational , too .
434522	2171244	780622	6.0	Well , don't worry . I'm not going to bite ya !	For men , this is the horror movie of horror movies . This is one mythological story that I would probably been better off not knowing . The story line and acting were nothing to write home about . It started off slow , and didn't pick up until it was almost over . Jess Weixler did a credible job in the lead as someone who was cursed , but confused . It definitely caused some Freudian anxiety as the castration occurred and the penises lay on the ground . The incident with the dog was particularly funny . You better watch out because now we have someone out there that can turn in on at will and if you pss her off . . .
433530	2171244	109446	6.0	Thanks Rev . Roy , you've been a real pain in the ass .	This is the one that started it all for young Brad Renfro ( Apt Pupil ) . he was 12 at the time . I remember this as a great movie by Sarandon ( Dead Man Walking ) , who got an Oscar nomination out of her performance in a year of great movies , the best being , of course , Four Weddings and a Funeral . Tommy Lee Jones ( The Fugitive , JFK ) was super as the Rev . Roy , and the lovely and talented Mary-Louise Parker ( " Weeds " , " Angels in America " ) was great as Mark's mom . There were many other great supporting performance - too many to mention . It was a great movie and a great start to a too-short career .
433989	2171244	56875	6.0	Call the Fremonts , fast ! And for Pete's sake , don't let them eat anything !	This was one of the 74 video nasties that were banned in Britain . Considered the first " splatter " film , it was re-released uncut in 2005 . One does not look at the acting ability or plot , but at the level of gore and blood in this film . From ripped out tongues , to brains splattered all over , it was a pioneer . Despite the fact that the lead , Connie Mason , was Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month for June 1963 , there is no titillation in the film . It is pure blood and gore . Mason will return for the second of director Herschell Gordon Lewis ' Blood Trilogy , Two Thousand Maniacs ! , the following year . Mason completed the trilogy with Color Me Blood Red , the following year . For cinematic history , you have to see this film .
432181	2171244	810823	6.0	You know how it is , a day where everything's going wrong ?	This was an interesting film that reminded me a little of Groundhog Day , The Matrix , and Harry Potter . Doesn't sound like a horror film , does it ? Mike Vogel ( The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ) is Ian , a man who wakes every day in a different occupation . He will continue to do so until he gets it right . Get what right ? Easy , he just has to forget his past and he will be OK . Every time he wakes in that new job , he is with Jenny , played by Christina Cole ( Casino Royale ) . Jenny is the key , he just doesn't know it yet . The first half of the movie contains little horror except for the fact that he dies every day . It picks up in the second half with graphic deaths at the hand of those dementor-looking creatures . A very hot Jaime Murray ( " Dexter " ) first appears to be his girlfriend , but her real role is soon known . Who Ian is and what they want is the crux of the film and it has a Matrix-type answer . Fascinating to the end .
434489	2171244	289944	6.0	Strong Turturro performance	John Turturro ( Barton Fink , Quiz Show , and , of course , Monk ) can be depended upon to give memorable performances , but this one stands out as one of his best . I am not familiar with the work of Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn ( Bleeder , Pusher II ) , but if this is an indication of his work , he should be examined further . This was a noir mystery that appears to bring out love or hate from those who view it . It is confusing and mysterious and leaves some questions unanswered , but Turturro's quest keeps us interested . Also features Deborah Kara Unger ( Emile , Payback ) .
432905	2171244	338526	6.0	Rings of garlic . . . holy water . . . silver stake . . . crucifix . . .	The opening to this movie was classic . I really liked seeing the villagers storming the castle to kill Dr . Frankenstein and his creation . But , what was Dracula doing there ? We quickly switch to a really strange Jekyll / Hyde that looks something out of Jack and the Beanstalk , and a secret order of the Catholic Church that employs Van Helsing ( Hugh Jackman ) to fulfill their mission of stamping out evil in the world ( minus the priests that prey on boys , of course ) . There is even a James Bond type Q Branch with new weapons . It is obvious that this is not going to be your father's Dracula / Van Helsing movie . The action is fast , the costuming , sound , CGI , and makeup are first rate . Dracula is brought into the 21st Century with a bang . But , is that bang worth the time ? Well , the fire works were amazing and the flying creatures were stunningly beautiful . There was even a " Birds " segment with bats instead really cool . Shuler Hensley made a great Frankenstein's Monster , and , of course , there is always Kate Beckinsale , a welcome sight in any movie . Mummy master Stephen Sommers wrote and directed an exciting film .
433292	2171244	910934	6.0	July Force with Steven Segal	This is more like the Steven Seagal that I used to enjoy in the early 90s in films like Hard to Kill , Out for Justice and Marked for Death . He actually is this movie and appears in almost every scene . Apparently he has run through enough dead wives that no one would marry him , so he is after the person who killed his son . He is a determined killing machine . As expected from a film that features urban gangs , every other word is fcker or motherfcker . I actually think they have beaten Scarface with this film . The only real criticism I had was the lighting . Almost the entire film took place at night and it was hard to watch . I guess that is to be expected in an urban environment . My man , Danny Trejo , gets his 15 seconds of fame in the movie .
432508	2171244	490084	6.0	Mom's ass is so tight , it's vacuum sealed .	I have no idea why this movie is so hated by critics , including some of my flick friends . I felt that Diane Keaton ( Annie Hall , Reds ) was absolutely the perfect helicopter mom . Raised in a generation when you were kicked out of the house at 18 and sent to make it on your own , I find the phenomenon of helicopter parents to be amusing . Mistakes are made by all of us . That is how we learn . It's OK to pick us up when we fall , but it is not OK to run around and try to prevent falls . Keaton as Mandy Moore's mom was the perfect example of the bad parent . I wanted to strangle her ! Moore was really good as someone trying to find love and not doing so well . She managed to make the right decisions at the right time , but for the wrong reasons . No matter . She lands on her feet and mom learns her lesson . Sure , this is a film that will probably land on Lifetime real soon , but it was deliciously funny and people should look at it with different eyes . They may just like it .
434425	2171244	71517	6.0	That's my sister , baby , and she's a whole lotta woman .	One of the better blaxploitation films with Pam Grier kicking butt and looking o so fine as she does it . The yellow dress that she wore as a hooker was mouth watering to say the least . Rape and revenge are the main threads running through the film , as she is on the warpath to avenge her lover , who was killed by the scumbags she is now working for . Lots of people die . Also features Sid Haig , who is familiar not only in director Jack Hill's other films like Coffy and Spider Baby , again , with Grier in Tarantino's Jackie Brown , and also in Rob Zombie's films House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects .
433534	2171244	117658	6.0	Troma release of Argento film	Troma remastered this director's cut of the dark Dario Argento film that features not only cutting edge CGI and special effects that had not been used in Italian horror previously , but also his own daughter in the lead . It had to be somewhat difficult directing a rape scene that includes your daughter . The haunting music throughout is done by none other than the five-time Oscar nominated Ennio Morricone . Seeing the beauty of Florence and Rome in a horror film is certainly a plus . This psychological thriller may not be for everyone , but it is certainly worth watching for Argento's direction , Morricone's music , and the beautiful Asia Argento .
434062	2171244	343996	6.0	Misses the real story of Cuba	Watching this film , I am so reminded of Casablanca . Like Rick , Fico Fellove ( Andy Garcia ) is seemingly oblivious to the oppression and evil that surrounds him , only concerned with running his nightclub . Unlike Rick , Fico never changes and only connects with the enemy to save his brother or his friend . The movie is just too darn pretty . It presents a Cuba that may be familiar to the upper class and the rich American tourists , and neglects to mention the Cuba that demanded a revolution . This Cuba , one of poor , uneducated peasants that were in virtual slavery on sugar and tobacco plantations and women who sold themselves to tourists , is seen only in Mikhail Kalatozov's Soy Cuba , which will be released in a deluxe edition this month . The movie worth watching for Garcia's performance and the performances of Dustin Hoffman , Bill Murray , and Elizabeth Peña , as well as some great Afro-Cuban music . It probably did great box office in Miami .
433693	2171244	112864	7.0	Willis and Jackson shine !	There are great buddy flicks out there - Mel Gibson and Danny Glover probably define the genre ; and , there is plenty of action in all the Die Hard flicks , but this film combines both in a package that is a pure joy to watch . Bruce Willis ( John McClane ) and Samuel L . Jackson ( Zeus ) make an outstanding combination in a film that has non stop action as they try to catch the brother of Han Gruber ( Die Hard ) , Simon ( Jeremy Irons ( Elizabeth I , Kingdom of Heaven ) . McClane and Zeus stretch the limits of believability in taking a beating in this film . You just can't believe that McClane can even get up after his last beating , much less run and jump . So , if you want to see two stars shine in an action vehicle with great dialog , this is your pick .
434625	2171244	629303	7.0	It's my baby !	This is the part of the series with the people I liked least - Detective Joe Fontana ( Dennis Farina ) and A . D . A . Alexandra Borgia ( Annie Parisse ) . I just didn't like the attitude of his character . He would do things like pull out a wad of cash like a pimp . She just didn't have any character at all - just limp . The story is good , with a wacko mom who stole a baby . But , like all " Law & Order " episodes there are the usual twists and turns that make thing interesting . Jack ( Sam Waterston ) falls short in this one , but Arthur ( Fred Dalton Thompson ) tried to make things right in the end .
432537	2171244	65145	7.0	Come on it's 1969 . 69 Let's go .	Now , this is the first sexploitation / grindhouse film that I thought worth paying money to see . I can imagine a whole theater full of men in white overcoats getting a thrill from this feature which had full frontal throughout the entire 70 minutes . Nude dancing and lesbian activity would have thrilled them for the first 60 minutes , then the film , which had a noir overtone , turned darker with sadistic encounters and even death . This is the best Michael Findlay sexploitation film I have seen , and it certainly beats his video nasty Snuff .
433159	2171244	405061	7.0	Reincarnation in creepy flick	I couldn't resist watching a movie with Qi Shu after seeing her in The Transporter . Unfortunately , while she did a great job of acting , the movie itself left a lot to be desired . It was really nothing more than an episode of Ghost Whisperer . She doesn't have " the gift " of seeing spirits until she attempts suicide subsequent to another failed relationship - - like anyone would believe that someone wouldn't want her ! It is more than seeing spirits , it relates to Buddhist beliefs and reincarnation . The key is that the spirits want to be reborn and forget their past lives . They do this by possessing babies as they are born . Of course , she is pregnant , too . She keeps seeing the same spirit and wants to find out why it is haunting her . That is an interesting part of the story and I won't spoil it for you . The only real horror is the fact that she attempts suicide three more times and fails each time . You won't believe the last two attempts . So , I got to see Qi Shu again , but I was hoping for better horror .
433862	2171244	338001	7.0	Finding Family	In the second part of a twin bill for Ian McKellen , he stars with Deborah Kara Unger in a compelling drama about a man who goes back home after 40 years and has to deal with the past he left behind . In contrast to Cold Comfort Farm , in which McKellan played a small role , this movie is all about him . He goes back and forth from the present to his life in Canada 40 years before . He even engages in conversations with his brothers , who appear in the present . he works to resolve his crisis and , with the help of 10-year-old Theo Crane , is able to come to a comfortable conclusion . For those of us who leave home and return , there is a lot of things familiar in this very good movie .
432996	2171244	455596	7.0	Hippos like chocolate . . .	One year later we find out intrepid hero ( Noah Wylie ) , an experienced Librarian and his bodyguard is no longer needed . In a nod to Indiana Jones , he brings back the Crystal Skull in the opening sequence before he sets out on his real adventure that brings him into contact with Gabrielle Anwar ( " Burn Notice " , who did manage to turn in such an impressive performance that the Academy of Science Fiction , Fantasy & Horror Films gave her a best supporting actress nomination . What is it with these English heroines ? We have a new director and a new writer , but we still go back to England for the love interest . Well , this isn't Body Snatchers , so we won't be seeing her ta tas . I won't reveal the bad guy here because it would spoil it . Besides Indiana Jones , you see bits of The Mummy , and even Casablanca in the movie . It is popcorn fun for fans of those movies and Wylie does a great job .
434256	2171244	112929	7.0	What you sow you reap !	Before Ms . Scrooge , there was this film , one of only two that I am aware of with a female Scrooge . Susan Lucci was just perfect in the role of Elizabeth ( Ebbie ) Scrooge , but it was the Christmas Ghosts that really stole the show . George Kaczender ( Christmas on Division Street ) has another hit with this film that is based on Dickens ' novel . Wendy Crewson ( Santa Clause , Santa Clause 2 , The Santa Clause 3 : The Escape Clause ) plays Roberta ' Robbie ' Cratchet , a single mom with two children , including Tiny Tim . Jennifer Clement and Nicole Parker were fantastically cute as the Ghosts of Christmas Past . They had a " Dreamgirls " look at first , then switched to an " I Dream of Genie " look . It was certainly a different twist . Lorena Gale ( Premonition , Slither ) was the Ghost of Christmas present and was so funny in that role . Molly Parker from " Deadwood " was the sister / niece . This was an interesting and light version that was really enjoyable .
432994	2171244	485851	7.0	Sometimes risking everything is the only choice you have .	An incredible little film that shows just how we are all interconnected and part of the universe . When one's wings flutter , it affects all around us , and in ways that can sometimes be very surprising . The emotions expressed in the film are all emotions that help us understand how we are interconnected . With the exception of Brandon Fraser and Andy Garcia , all the roles in the film were confined to a particular segment . There were some very good actors in small parts in the film . Fraser was fantastic in a very unemotional role . His first attempts at showing any emotion cost him his life , just as Forest Whitaker's attempt at happiness cost him his . I really like Whitaker's musing that happiness comes from playing by the rules and doing well in school . The reward for doing well in school is more school and more school , and then you can get a job and start wanting things . Do any of us every attain happiness ? Or , as Whitaker , are we stuck in some dead-end job wanting ? Kevin Bacon showed how one risks it all for love and gave a superb performance . I just kept wishing that Sorrow ( Sarah Michelle Gellar ) was that little girl from his past . I bet she was and they just didn't tell us . A very pleasurable hour and a half .
433281	2171244	365485	7.0	I'm as serious as an erection problem .	Pierce Brosnan was the best Bond in my opinion . I hated to see him finish that . He was also great in Butterfly on a Wheel and The Thomas Crown Affair . But , it was this dark comedy that got him a Golden Globe nomination . It is one of those men's films that you probably skipped , but should check out . Even international hit men have serious problems , and Julian ( Brosnan ) is starting to cone apart . He meets Danny ( Greg Kinnear ) in Mexico and hopes that he can put him straight again . If you like your comedy Pulp-Fiction style , then this is the film for you .
433952	2171244	74483	7.0	You really are a dirty bastard , ain't you , Harry ?	I really felt Dirty last night , so I revisited this film along with The Gauntlet and Magnum Force . Sometimes , you just need to immerse yourself into the world of " Dirty " Harry to remember what life is all about . There are sheep and there are goats . Most of us are sheep , but we need goats like Harry Callahan ( Clint Eastwood ) to remind us that " . . . if you want to jerk all these people off , you can , but don't do it with me . " Too often , we go along like sheep while the bureaucrats do their song and dance . Nothing gets accomplished , and people get hurt . I am not a big Tyne Daly fan , but she really did a good job as Harry's partner . Bradford Dillman , who will be back with a different name in Sudden Impact , was perfect as the toady who would kiss any butt to get promoted . Lots of action , and the heart of " Dirty " Harry shines through the rough exterior again .
432202	2171244	160009	7.0	Good thriller - lots of action	First off the technical aspects of this movie were superior in every sense . The sound , the editing , the camera work , all of it was fantastic and made this an enjoyable treat . You have to enjoy all that because , with the exception of Donald Sutherland who is always on , the acting isn't there . Wesley Snipes is one of my favorite actions heroes , but we all know that action heroes can't act . Well , maybe Bruce Willis is the exception . But for an action hero , Wesley is great and does a great job here - for an action hero . And , hey , Marie Matiko was easy on the eyes . If you liked Enemy of the State , you will like this movie .
433422	2171244	35664	7.0	A good one for Veteran's Day	There is no big action in this film . It could easily be a play . It is , however , a great story of 13 heroic men who stood against impossible odds to do their duty . In that sense , it is a good film for Veteran's day . Most of the soldiers in WWII did not do Audie Murphy style heroics , but did their duty and hung in there to aid in the war effort . The efforts here were of extreme importance and the men died with honor . Tough guy Robert Taylor stars , and there is a great performance by Desi Arnaz . The crazy / heroic ending may be trite , but it was good .
432857	2171244	87280	7.0	I'm gonna f8ck you back to the stone age .	How to describe a film so avant-garde that Dirk Bogarde threatened to quit the Cannes jury if it got an award ? A film that references Blade runner , with a burned-out cop ( Michael Elphick ) brought back into a futuristic Europe to find a serial killer . A film that has been described by some as " The Silence of the Lambs " meets " Delicatessen " . Fans of David Lynch may thrill at this futuristic film noir . Many will run for the exits , as it takes quite a bit of time to develop . It is Lars von Trier's first English-language film , and it is in a sepia-tone that adds to the feeling that Europe is crumbling . Water is an element that flows throughout , again adding to the feeling that something is rotten . Elphick hooks up with Me Me Lai in her last film . She had done a lot of cannibal work before this - an interesting combination of actors . Elphick goes into a experimental drug-induced hypnotic state to try and recreate the crimes and catch the killer . Things get really surreal from here . Cinematography , sound , and special effects were all superb in this very strange film .
434290	2171244	35460	7.0	Hot for Hedy as a Potuguese beauty	It could only happen in Hollywood . They buy the rights to a Steinbeck novel about Mexicans and Portuguese in California and put all white actors in the cast . Now , maybe I can buy Hedy Lamarr as a Portuguese beauty , but Spenser Tracy and John Garfield as Mexicans ? Ludicrous casting , especially when the story is so ethnic . But , maybe it was genius as common stereotypes about Afro - and Mexican-Americans are played out in the form of Tracy , as a shiftless bum who mooches off his friends and manipulates them into providing him with wine and a roof over his head . Pilon ( Tracy ) is not interested in satisfying anything but his own belly and even goes after a poor wood-seller called The Pirate , in the form of Frank Morgan , who , in a Scorcese moment , got the Oscar nomination he should have gotten three years earlier for The Wizard of Oz . Lamarr was as beautiful as ever , and John Garfield did a great job as her pursuer , even as he had to avoid complete ruin from the machinations of Pilon .
433276	2171244	100405	7.0	We both screw people for money .	Julia Roberts got a Golden Globe along with an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of a prostitute in an updated version of My Fair Lady . As ridiculous as the story is , one has to admit that it was just plain funny . No prostitutes I have ever seen on the news that actually work the streets look like Julia Roberts ; not even like her pal Laura San Giacomo - most are just ugly . It is not a pretty business and I think it a flaw of the film to glamorize it . But , it was so funny ! Yes , seeing Julia in a position that was uncomfortable was funny , but why couldn't she have just been a flower seller ? Maybe the speech-writer for a current presidential candidate wrote this script . I can see Vivian and Kit yelling , " Yes , We Can ! " Come on , it was funny ! OK , Julia's slapstick was a little over the top , but Hector Elizondo was amazing funny as the Manager and doesn't get enough credit for his understated performance . It was funny and that makes it worth revisiting .
434120	2171244	52905	7.0	This is , I think , a two-pipe problem .	Peter Cushing makes a great Holmes , and the Hammer film was much more enjoyable than the other Holmes film . André Morell makes a better Dr . Watson , and is not so much a bumbling fool as Nigel Bruce . But , I will have to get the 1939 version of this adventure to compare apples with apples . I really liked having Christopher Lee in the film . I always enjoy his performances and he does well with Cushing . The story was very interesting and as old as time itself . Even so , It was well into the film before I guessed it . I guess I won't be quitting my day job to become a detective .
433346	2171244	79240	7.0	I wanted the money .	Another great Donald Sutherland film and a great caper film to boot . Sutherland stars with Sean Connery and Leslie-Anne Down in a bawdy and fun caper to rob a train while moving of a gold shipment of £25 , 000 heading to pay British soldiers in the Crimean War . A seemingly impossible task that is complicated at the last minute and has some funny twists and turns is a joy to watch . Of course , the real joy is watching Connery and Sutherland as the plan and execute this caper . Great cinematography and Michael Crichton does not disappoint as director of a film based on his own novel .
433061	2171244	120894	7.0	The line that separates good and evil cuts through every human heart .	This wasn't you usual vampire story with lots of blood and scary scenes . It was more primeval . It was simply about survival and the search for love , which would ensure immortality . It was about someone who was just tired of the whole effort at living . It was about that line between good and evil . Jude Law was fantastic as the primitive being just trying to find the right mate . Elina Löwensohn was captivating and you never knew if she would fall into the spell of Law . Timothy Spall was fantastic as the cop . The film was a good mix of comedy and drama and mystery . It was highly entertaining .
433366	2171244	374330	7.0	Effects were spectacular !	A Japanese soldier travels across the Gobi to chase a deserter , but they have to join forces against a common enemy to reach their destination . Japanese actor Kiichi Nakai and Chinese actor Wen Jiang lead a brilliant cast that includes Xueqi Wang as leader of the desert bandits and the incredibly beautiful Chinese actress Zhao Wei , who will be appearing with Infernal Affairs actor Tony Leung next year in John Woo's The Battle of Red Cliff . She starred with Leung in Chinese Odyssey 2002 . The battles were fierce , but the incredible scenery and special effects are what grabs you as the duel between Kiichi Nakai and Wen Jiang were delayed not only to fight the bandits and the Turks who wanted to control Western China , but to deliver a sacred relic to the Buddists . This relic had special powers that made this film beautiful .
432849	2171244	431197	8.0	Don't fear them , my child . We are going to kill them all .	An excellent look at the differences between the Islamic terrorists and Americans , and how we are also so much the same . The movie really started slowly , but that is what happens in all relationships . It took time for Agent Fleury ( Jaime Foxx ) to get close to Colonel Farris ( Ashraf Barhom ) and get the things they wanted . They had to establish that they were professionals looking to end this madness . The rest of the team was also great . I love anything Chris Cooper does , Jennifer Garner was super , and Jason Bateman was great as the reluctant member of the team . Damon Schmidt ( Jeremy Piven ) was a typical asshole bureaucrat , and I loved it when he almost lost it . Then the action really started with some magnificent stunt work . When the convoy moves down the freeway , and an SUV rear ends a Mercedes that explodes , setting off a multi car crash including cannon rolls , T-bones and pyrotechnics , you were just glued to your seat . Even Zoe Bell ( Grindhouse ) was in on the action . A great chase , and real action at the end . But , let us not forget that it will really never end .
432732	2171244	21873	8.0	Why did you kill my mother ?	This Oscar-nominated film ( Best Picture ) shows the dark side of journalism as a paper delves into the past of a woman ( Frances Starr ) who was impregnated by her boss and acquitted of his murder . Edward G . Robinson ( Little Caesar ) is a newspaper editor that is interested in boosting circulation and is not concerned with the lives he destroys in the process . He goes after Nancy Voorhees ( Starr ) , who is now Nancy ( Voorhees ) Townsend and is not concerned that she has not told her daughter ( the doll-faced Marian Marsh ) , who is now about to me married , about her past . Robinson was absolutely brilliant in the role and ably assisted by Boris Karloff and Oscar-nominated actress ( Dragon Seed ) Aline MacMahon in her first film . A classic showing the seedy side of journalism .
432143	2171244	13257	8.0	Who knew that people in the Middle Ages all slept naked .	I leave it to others to heap praise upon the writer / director of this film and to discuss his importance in film history . I initially sought it out as it was mentioned as a precursor to the nunsploitation genre , and I wanted to see the first of that , even if it was a silent . It is only vaguely in the genre , as it displays nuns going through what we would now call somnambulism , kleptomania , and hysteria , but in the day were considered signs of witchcraft . I don't know if there is a better film on the subject of witchcraft , but I certainly had a much greater understanding of the subject after watching Christensen's documentary . One can easily see the deviousness and deception used by the pious members of the church as they murdered over 8 million men , women , and children . I imagine that on Stalin killed more - maybe Pol Pot , too , I am not sure . It was highly instructive that most of the so-called witches that were burned in the Middle Ages were old and poor . Sounds like a plan the conservatives would heartily embrace . It was interesting to see what is also most likely the first filmed instance of good cop - bad cop . I found the film to be what I would consider to be very spicy for 1922 , the special effects were amazing considering what was available at the time , and the story certainly kept my interest throughout . I also watched the 1967 remake with William Burroughs narrating and found it to be easier to watch and the jazz score was certainly better than the typical music used in silent films .
432923	2171244	122690	8.0	Happy Birthday Sean	Great sound , great " buy the CD " soundtrack , a car chase that sets the standard , and great acting . This intellectual thriller may be slow at times to some as the characters seem to chat a lot , but look who's chatting . Robert De Niro , Jean Reno ( great in Godzilla ) , Sean Bean ( our birthday boy ) , Natascha McElhone ( Laurel Canyon ) , Stellan Skarsgård ( Bootstrap Bill Turner ) , and Jonathan Pryce ( Governor Weatherby Swann ) . And , if that is not enough to get you interested , there's Katarina Witt . You have the IRA , the Russian Mafia and a superb intellectual thriller . This is what action movies should be .
432824	2171244	841149	8.0	Sorry . That's all - sorry .	This film uses chapter breaks and comic book-style illustrations to highlight the amusing , astonishing , and horrifying absurdity of its central tale : that of an Iraqi that was taken prisoner based upon false information . The same duo that borough us Gunner Palace , a look at the Iraq invasion from the eyes of an American soldier , now presents a view from the Iraqi side in this indie film nominated for an American Spirit Award . Now , one may tend to discount the testimony of an Iraqi about innocence or the conditions at the prisons , or the treatment by interrogators , but the fact is that there is overwhelming documentation written by U . S . military in high positions attesting to the fact that up to 90 % of the prisoners had no intelligence values and were " simply in the wrong place at the wrong time . " These same military officers also knew of the inhumane conditions in the prisons and the fact that basic sanitation was lacking , and that the contractor-supplied food was rancid and infested and caused the prisoners to vomit and experience diarrhea after they ate . This would be obvious to anyone who saw the prisoners as they had all lost weight . The treatment of the Iraqis as documented in this film brings shame upon all Americans as we are the ones who allow those responsible to remain in office .
432397	2171244	70290	8.0	Who's your daddy ?	I just cannot imagine a Jack Nicholson film that is not worth two hours of my life . This was an excellent example of his acting ability . It's not just me that thinks so , as he was nominated for an Academy Award . Randy Quaid and Otis Young were also superb . It even featured a cute Carol Kane as a prostitute . This was a quiet dramedy about Nicholson being a father figure for Quaid and teaching him about beer drinking , cussing , fighting , and getting laid - all those things he never learned . It was a beautiful character study done by a master actor . They do not make them like this anymore .
432555	2171244	439	8.0	1001 Films to see before you die .	It is reported to be the first use of narrative in a film in this country , and it is certainly the first " western " film . All other cops and robbers films sprang from this one . It is short . Depending upon where you see it ( YouTube , Google , etc ) , it can run from nine to 11 minutes , and some have color painted in . It was not about " stars " as no one is credited in the film , not even the director . It is about an infant industry showing what they can do and what we can maybe expect in the next 100 years . Hard to believe how far we have come from this start . It will keep your interest from start to finish , which is more than can be said about many films today . Any serious film lover has to add this to their list .
433523	2171244	417	8.0	1001 Films to see before you die .	It was amazing that , in 1902 , the filmmaker Georges Méliès had the foresight to add showgirls to his little film . Whether from the Folies Bergères or Vegas , the showgirl will always be a part of cinema . This is presumable the first SciFi flick , and the animation was a real joy to watch , as was the lack of scientific knowledge . Imagine going to the moon shot out of a cannon ; imagine astronauts in tops hats and tails ; imagine that to return all you need is to drop the capsule off the moon and it will return to Earth . These are not errors , but part of what makes this film so enjoyable , like the fact that the capsule hits the moon right in the eye like a big pizza pie . That's Amore .
434318	2171244	65528	8.0	Get back in the car , you smirking slut !	Dr . ' Doc ' Daneeka : Sure . Catch-22 . Anyone who wants to get out of combat isn't really crazy , so I can't ground him . Yossarian : OK , let me see if I've got this straight . In order to be grounded , I've got to be crazy . And I must be crazy to keep flying . But if I ask to be grounded , that means I'm not crazy anymore , and I have to keep flying . Dr . ' Doc ' Daneeka : You got it , that's Catch-22 . Yossarian : Whoo . . . That's some catch , that Catch-22 . Dr . ' Doc ' Daneeka : It's the best there is . People don't want to watch movie showing the stupidity of war . They want heroes so they can go to sleep at night thinking all those dead soldiers meant something . Unfortunately , war is just failed diplomacy , or someone showing how big his cajones are . What's the purpose of an Army if we can't use it ? Why are the Japanese now dropping bombs . Because a defensive Army is useless in showing cajones . Alan Arkin is magnificent as Capt . John Yossarian , who just wants to go home . He knows he's crazy to keep flying , but knowing that means he's not crazy , so he has to keep flying , which is crazy . The cast of this movie is one of the best I have seen : Martin Balsam , Richard Benjamin , Art Garfunkel , Bob Newhart , Paula Prentiss , Norman Fell , Charles Grodin and more giving us laughs aplenty from Buck Henry's superb screenplay based on Joseph Heller's novel under the direction of Mike Nichols . And , of course , there is Olimpia Carlisi , reason alone to watch .
433686	2171244	364656	8.0	Noir is dead ; long live neo-noir	Film Noir has not existed since the sixties , but filmmakers are incorporating the aspects of the genre into new films . Examples include Fargo , Se7en , L . A . Confidential , Pulp Fiction , The Usual Suspects , Memento , Reservoir Dogs , and Sin City . Canadian Gary Yates has written and directed a film that reminds us of the old days with the low lights and hard criminals , but in a comedy of cons conning cons . It may take a scorecard to figure out who is conning who , but viewers will be thrilled with the ending . Kevin Pollack ( The Usual Suspects ) and Liane Balaban lead this quirky and enjoyable film with a great supporting cast that will keep you guessing .
434170	2171244	217505	8.0	The appearance of law must be upheld , especially when it's being broken .	It was nominated for practically everything in 2003 : Best Picture ; Best Actor in a Leading Role for Daniel Day-Lewis ; Best Art Direction-Set Decoration ; Best Cinematography ; Best Costume Design ; Best Director for Martin Scorsese ; Best Editing ; Best Music , Original Song for the song " The Hands That Built America " ; Best Sound ; and Best Writing , Original Screenplay . It won nothing . Sure , it won a Golden Globe for Scorcese and U2 , and 31 other awards at other ceremonies , but it had the unfortunate luck to come out in a year of great films : The Pianist , Almodóvar ' s Hable con ella , Road to Perdition , of course , Chicago , and even Eminem beat out U2 . That doesn't diminish a great story , it just makes it hard to see amongst all the other stars out there in the sky . Besides Daniel Day-Lewis , I enjoyed Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz in their roles , and I always enjoy Liam Neeson . Kudos also to Jim Broadbent and John C . Reilly .
432437	2171244	435625	8.0	Hey , there's something down here . . .	If there was ever the remotest chance that I would ever go into a cave , that chance just became non existent after seeing this film . Girls may want to have fun , but these girls - Shauna Macdonald , Natalie Jackson Mendoza , Alex Reid , Saskia Mulder , MyAnna Buring ( Grindhouse ) , and Nora-Jane No one - are starkers ! I'm all for a little adventure , but this was more than my heart can take . Hell , it was almost too much just watching it . If you want to get scared shitless , then you have to see this film . Makeup was incredible and there were some great performance in an adrenaline-pumping exercise in terror .
434010	2171244	420260	8.0	Loneliness & compulsion are part of our being .	All of us have felt loneliness at one time or another . Probably not to the extent that Tony ( Issei Ogata ) felt . His father made sure he would be lonely by giving him an unusual name which prevented acceptance from the beginning . After years of loneliness , he takes a beautiful wife ( Rie Miyazawa ) . He is no longer lonely , but becomes fearful that he will experience loneliness again . The beautiful piano music that plays throughout and the minimal sets remind us that loneliness is ever present . The film moves slowly , just as loneliness might move . Tony is fairly happy after marriage , but another problem crops up . His wife is obsessed with clothes . We are talking Imelda Marcos obsessed . She is addicted to buying and it consumes her to the point that she cannot stop without withdrawal . Her obsession causes her death and Tony is alone again . He struggles through the loneliness in strange fashion . We have moved from the action of his married life , back to the minimalism . Jun Ichikawa did a magnificent job of using voice-over and music and set to create the perfect mood and a perfect retelling of Haruki Murakami's novel .
433064	2171244	454921	8.0	Where are we going ?	Will Smith gave an Oscar-nominated performance in this excellent film about a father's love and going after your dream . I doubt if anyone could possibly imagine the heartbreak and struggle the Chris Gardner went though unless you have been there yourself . The fact that is was based on the story of a real person made it all the more powerful . I cannot imaging anyone watching this and not feeling tears welling up as they saw the impossible odds that faced Chris and his raw determination to just keep going . he knew that there was happiness waiting for him as long as he continued the pursuit . Isn't that all we are promised - the pursuit of happiness ? It is up to us to keep going and try to reach the goal . Thandie Newton also gave a great performance as his wife in a small and unheralded role .
434284	2171244	35369	8.0	I is getting ' mighty tired pretending Eskimos are from Virginia .	The John Wayne Marathon continues into the 14th hour with a whole boatload of interesting characters in a story about the gold rush in Alaska . Wayne gets third billing in this movie to Marlene Dietrich and Randolph Scott . Dietrich plays a jealous girlfriend and Scott is the new dude in town that is muscling in . Margaret Lindsay plays the new girl in town after Wayne's heart . Harry Carey is Wayne's partner . This is at least the 4th version of this story and it won't be the last . A tale of gold mining , claim jumping , saloon , muddy streets , brawls and fancy women will always be in style . Hang on to your hat and enjoy another Wayne classic .
432310	2171244	420251	8.0	Three from the masters of horror	The first segment from Chinese director Fruit Chan , written by Lilian Lee features the incredibly beautiful and talented Bai Ling . She makes the best dumplings ; in addition , we get to see two incredible dumplings while she is chopping . Her dumplings constitute a fountain of youth . Her ingredients are the secret and they are something that would be unimaginable to those who haven't seen this film . When Mrs Lee ( Miriam Yeung Chin Wah ) finds out what she is being fed ; oh , my ! But , she returns for more treatments . The result is amazing and her husband , the multi-talented Tony Leung Ka Fai is all over her . She even gets pregnant , although told she never could . But there is always a price to pay for what we want . The art direction and cinematography for this film is brilliant . Oldboy director Chan-wook Park from Korea gives us the next segment " Cut . " This is really a strange movie about an " extra " that is upset that the director is such a " good " man along with being rich , and wants to change him . He starts by cutting of his wife's fingers . She is a concert pianist , and then asks him to kill someone to let his wife go . It was really fascinating and sometimes funny while being gory . Won-hie Lim was dynamite ! And then , Takashi Miike's " Box " to finish the selections . It was just strange .
432761	2171244	117951	8.0	With God's help I'll conquer this terrible affliction .	The last time I remember seeing someone going through withdrawal was Frank Sinatra in The Man With the Golden Arm : " You mean just stop ? Cold turkey ? You don't understand ! The pain . . . " Renton ( Ewan McGregor ) was a little more expressive : " I don't feel the sickness yet , but it's in the post . That's for sure . I'm in the junkie limbo at the moment . Too ill to sleep . Too tired to stay awake , but the sickness is on its way . Sweat , chills , nausea . Pain and craving . A need like nothing else I've ever known will soon take hold of me . It's on its way . " The truth about drugs and the awful toll it take is clearly shown here . The most awful moment come after the baby dies and the mother is quick to " relieve her pain . " The most disgusting moment was the toilet : an apt illustration of just what you will do for drugs . The amorality of sex with a schoolgirl is also apropos . This film is funny at times , but certainly there was no glamor . It was just some sick people with their lives going in circles . John Hodge's screenplay was magnificent . Danny Boyle's ( Shallow Grave , 28 Days Later . . . ) direction was super . Along with McGregor , the performances of Robert Carlyle ( The Full Monty , Human Trafficking ) and Kelly Macdonald ( What's her connection to Sinatra ? ) were impressive .
433925	2171244	245574	8.0	Truth is cool but unattainable . . . the truth is totally amazing , but you can't ever reach it .	Road movie ? Teen sex movie ? Political movie ? Coming of age movie ? You can find a little of everything in this frank and open movie by Alfonso and Carlos Cuarón . Coming from different strata in Mexican society , I was amazed at hoe the two boys , Diego Luna and Gael García Bernal were just like brothers . They were inseparable until they both violated each other by sleeping with their girlfriends , but that was quickly forgotten until society again separated them for good . Forget the girlfriends , Maribel Verdú was spectacular and her efforts to bond the boys together worked for a while . She was just what I would hope to be in her situation . She faced it with courage . Great music , great sex scenes , and a great story about life .
432604	2171244	71507	8.0	Not your daddy's nunsploitation	There is so much that can be said about this film . It is not your typical nunsploitation . Of course , there is nudity and sex with nuns , but that is almost incidental to the story . It is set in 15th Century Italy , at the time of the martyrdom of 800 Christians at Otranto . The battle between the Muslims and the Christians takes up a good part of the film . It was interesting when everyone was running from the Muslim hoards , that the mother superior would ask , " Why do you fear the Muslims , ; they will not do anything that the Christians have done to you ? " Certainly , there was enough torture on both sides . Sister Flavia ( Florinda Bolkan ) is sent to a convent for defying her father . In the process , she witnesses and endures many things : the gelding of a stallion , the rape of a local woman by a new Duke , the torture of a nun who was overcome during a visit by the Tarantula Sect , and a whipping herself when she ran off with a Jew . The torture was particularly gruesome with hot wax being poured on the nun , and her nipples cut off . Sister Flavia is bound to continue to get into trouble as she questions the male-dominated society in which she lives . She even asks Jesus , why the father , son and holy ghost are all men . Eventually , she joins the leader of the Muslims as his lover and they sack the convent . Here is where you see more flesh than you can possible enjoy at one time . But , tragedy is to come . She manages to exact sweet revenge on all , including the Duke and her father , but finds that the Muslim lover treats her exactly the same . She is a woman and that is all there is to it . I won't describe what the holy men of the church did to this heretic at the end , but it predates the torture of Saw or Hostel by decades . Nunsploitation fans will be satisfied with the treats , but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to digest .
432171	2171244	117603	8.0	When you've lost everything , you have nothing left to lose	Set it Off , with Jada Pinkett Smith , Queen Latifah , Vivica A . Fox , and Kimberly Elise . The story of four Black women , all of whom needed money , but , more importantly , all of whom suffered at the hands of the majority causing a change in the direction of their lives . Whether it was being fired so a bank manager can save face , or having your brother shot due to trigger-happy cops , or having you child removed by an unfeeling and uncaring child welfare worker , prejudice worked to change the lives of the women involved and , ultimately , lead to their deaths . A powerful film with a powerful message . This was one of the most enjoyable films I have seen lately .
432312	2171244	404163	8.0	What are you willing to lay on the line ?	You can sit in a University and listen to dry lectures from Psychology profs , or you can watch a great movie like this and understand human nature and desire more than you ever imagined . Yes , we all want more , but most are not willing to make the commitment necessary to get it , and some cannot live with the consequences of failure . Who was it that said , " If you put all you own on one roll of the dice , and lose , and start over , you will be a man . " That's why so many people stay married when they shouldn't - they can't face starting over . This film had more life lessons that you can imagine and some damn fine actors to teach and entertain us . Kim Basinger was magnificent as a struggling writer who falls into a gambling addiction . She really gets pathetic as she falls deeper in debt . Danny DeVito was also great as someone who life passed by and was now picking up crumbs . When faced with total loss , he took the coward's way out . Forest Whitaker gave an excellent performance as someone living on his brother's ( Nick Cannon ) ability . Tim Roth as Victor , the criminal , was dead on . I also enjoyed Ray Liotta and Carla Gugino , and thought Carson Brown was amazing . Funniest Line : " Teenagers . . . they are God's way of punishing us for having sex . "
433198	2171244	51554	8.0	Sleep well , Mr . Harker .	It just would not be Halloween with seen one of the Hammer Horror Films starring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing . And , what better one to watch than Dracula . Lee's Dracula is smooth and sophisticated and perfect for the role of a Count . When he bends over the beautiful but helpless woman , she doesn't need to be naked , as you see her breasts heave and the short bursts of breath right before his penetration . Makes me want to roll over and have a cigarette afterwards . Cushing is a magnificent Van Helsing , and he has a professional air about him that is quite endearing . He suffers fools as a gentleman . There may be argument over the nest Dracula , but this is certainly in the running .
434383	2171244	125439	8.0	Hugh Grant & Julia Roberts sparkle	Can a common man ever expect to be in the company of a beautiful star ? Maybe not in real life , but for the many that hope to ever do so this movie is a ray of hope . Hugh Grant was absolutely marvelous as a bookseller who bumps into Julia Roberts . She was equally fantastic in what I perceive to be her best performance since Pretty Woman . Rhys Ifans was absolutely over-the-top as his flatmate . As Lloyd Dobler said in " Say Anything . . . " My goal in life is just to be with her . What a goal . Lloyd achieved it and so did William Thacker . There is hope ! I would be remiss if I did not mention the fantastic music in this movie . It was just incredible . Shania Twain , Al Green , Bob Marley , and on and on . It was a perfect soundtrack . That seems to characterize all of the romantic comedies that Grant is in . Damn , this was one great movie !
434231	2171244	447544	8.0	Wetbacks - the other side of the coin	Wetback : The Undocumented Documentary is an excellent film by Arturo Pereze Torres and Heather Haynes . It shows the issue of immigration into the US from the side of the undocumented worker . We all know the side of the vigilantes . All we have to do is watch anyone on Fox to get that side . But , what do we really know about the other side . The Smoking Gun's expose of A Million Little Pieces showed us that what we think is true often isn't . Wetback shows us the poverty that drives workers across our borders . Poverty that causes them to literally risk life and limb to get something for their family . It also shows the gains to the US and other American countries from the undocumented workers in this country . But , it is really all about survival . Survival is what drives them to travel thousands of miles , facing Mexican police and gangs that rob and rape them , and the Border Patrol and the vigilantes in the US . Survival - something many of us have never faced and , hopefully , will not face . It is helpful to know the other side of the coin . I think it makes us a better person .
434548	2171244	412919	8.0	These women were great !	I have never seen a wrestling match with women . I don't know how common it was in the early seventies when I used to see some wrestling on TV when sitting at the bar on Sunday morning , but there was never any on . I have never seen the cuties that wrestle for the WWE now . So , I have nothing to compare , but I was just simply fascinated listening to these women and seeing clips from their matches in the 40s and 50s . These women were the real thing . They were out there putting their bodies on the line and giving it all they had . Some complained that they were financially abused , but then I see them talk about all the things they could now buy that they couldn't before , so I don't know . These were athletes in every sense of the word ; not bimbo's that are doing it just to titillate .
434125	2171244	492447	8.0	Fair Trade for Coffee growers	I have to admit that I have been drinking coffee for forty years and I will be drinking coffee when I finally give up the ghost . I found this story to be so exciting , but also sad . I really enjoyed seeing the process of coffee growing , roasting and sale , but I was totally distressed at the fact that a cup of coffee sells for 25 times what the farmers in Ethopia get for growing it . It is further distressing that a small increase in the amount paid would make tremendous effect on their lives . They just want to educate their children and buy them a pair of shoes . Paying them a fair price would probably not increase what we pay for a pound of coffee in a measurable way , but it would make all the difference in the world to them . What is the alternative ? They are now growing plants used as a narcotic in East Africa because they cannot get a fair price for coffee . The shame is not on them , but on us . This was a great film and the only criticism I could ever make about it was that it was not in Indonesia , where they make my favorite Sulawese coffee .
433286	2171244	51201	8.0	Superb courtroom drama	I just finished watching Live Free and Die Harder for the second time . I was blown away by the special effects , and Bruce Willis ' capability to take more punishment than a human could be expected to and live . After that I wanted something that had the same fireworks but done with acting and not special effects . This film fit the bill nicely . The acting in this film was so spectacular that calls for every superlative in the book . While I have watched Billy Wilder direct comedy , I never expected to see him do something that rivals Hitchcock . In fact , if you didn't know it was Wilder beforehand , you would easily call this a Hitchcock film . Tyrone Power as the defendant was so smooth that you knew he was a guilty man . You just knew it , even though he kept denying it . He was perfect as the cad that preys on elderly women . Marlene Dietrich gave what I thought was the performance of a lifetime as his wife . She definitely provided the fireworks and the surprises to this film . Charles Laughton as the barrister that tried the case was magnificent . There are not enough words to describe the performance he provided . Supreme enjoyment every time he opened his mouth . Of course , you cannot ignore Elsa Lanchester as the nurse that failed miserably at trying to control Laughton after a heart attack . The two of them provided so much humor to this film that one would want to see it again and again just for that . Nothing can be said about the film without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it . It is well worth the time in finding it on cable or adding it to your queue .
434311	2171244	296042	8.0	There's no love in your violence .	Kano : Older Brother Kakihara , you were in love with Boss Anjo , weren't you ? But it wasn't because you were queer or admired him or something . It was because you loved the pain you felt when he beat you up . That's why you're looking for him so hard , isn't it ? Director Takashi Miike has given us a film that is like nothing I have ever seen . I thought I had seen some horror , but this is the ultimate that I have experienced . Kakihara ( Tadanobu Asano ) is a sado-masochist of the highest form . He has brought torture to an art . He works for an equally sadistic boss who loves to beat up women . As to the title character Ichi ( Nao Omori ) , I am still trying to figure him out . I know he is a tool of a hypnotist , used to fight the Yakuza in horrible fashion . Do not watch after eating if you have a weak stomach . The funniest comment I have heard is comparing him to Adam Sandler in The Waterboy . I haven't seen that film , but I don't think Sandler has made any movies like this . I would call this torture-porn and only for those who have seen Saw and Hostel . O , yes , I have seen Takashi Miike's Audition , and there is no comparison .
433516	2171244	20530	8.0	1001 Movies to see before you die	Oscar-nominee Luis Buñuel ( That Obscure Object of Desire , The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie ) , the father of film surrealism , joins with another surrealist , Salvador Dalí , in his first film as a director . The film opens with a man cutting a woman's eyeball , but it get stranger as we see ants come out of a man's hand , and , well , it just keeps getting more bizarre . Don't look for a plot as it is more like free association , where psychoanalytic patients are invited to relate whatever comes into their minds during the analytic session , and not to censor their thoughts . Programmed for a short run , this film lasted eight months in the theater .
433335	2171244	330904	8.0	The Japanese David Lynch	The fact that your film is a winner at Venice is evidence enough of your artistry . Shinya Tsukamoto ( Ichi the Killer ) wrote , directed and starred in this weird film that certainly establishes him as and eccentric and extreme cinema pioneer . Saved by Rinko ( Asuka Kurosawa ) , Iguchi ( Tsukamoto ) seeks to return the favor and help her escape her boring , sexless life as a wife of a successful Japanese businessman ( Yuji Kohtari ) , who is all work and no play . He blackmails her into walking around the streets in a very short mini with no underwear , ala Britney Spears and Paris Hilton . He also has her buy a vibrator and some long veggies to use in masturbatory experiences . But it is not all kinky sex , as there is some torture that would make the movie inappropriate for CIA personnel . They don't need any new ideas to replace water-boarding . All of this is done in a sometimes surreal manner with a blue and white color scheme and constant rainfall that makes for an interesting mood . Tsukamoto has never disappointed me , but you certainly have to look at his films with a different eye .
433825	2171244	51994	8.0	Women and children first .	I could not help but think of my Grandfather , who came over to this country in steerage fro0m Sicily . Fortunately , his ship did not sink or he would have been treated as the passengers were on this ship . They really had not choice as there were 1000 more passengers than there were lifeboat spaces . This was an excellent film about the sinking of the Titanic without all the silliness that accompanies more modern films . You can see clearly that , besides not having enough boats , the actions of the first class passengers leading up to the crash with the iceberg was largely responsible for the death toll . There were some outstanding actors in this film like Kenneth More , Honor Blackman , David McCallum , Sean Connery , and more . Blood good film , I say !
434295	2171244	841119	9.0	Everybody is right when it comes to the issue of abortion .	It seems fitting that I watched this on the very day that I read about the atrocious state of child protection in Oklahoma . It is a reminder of the definition of " Pro-Life " that I believe so strongly : they only care about life before it is born , and are not concerned with life after birth . It was an outstanding documentary that gave both sides of the issue , even to the point of showing an actual abortion being performed . I could have done without that . This is however , the definitive film on the issue . Some may consider it slanted as it showed the pro-life advocates as crazy loons , but when they are self-confessed bigots like leader Randall Terry , and Klan members / ministers like John Burk that consider murderers " patriots , " what else can you call them . This film will give you a good picture of where this issue started , and why it continues to this day . You will learn just who is keeping this alive and their reasons for doing so . You will also be well informed on the types of people who are using this issue for their personal causes . Great film to educate you on this sensitive issue .
434467	2171244	478134	9.0	Why do we send our boys to battle monsters ?	It has been said many times that war movies are not doing well because America is not ready . They are not ready to face the truth that we are creating young men who must battle demons that they are unprepared to cope with . The fact that we have a record number of suicides by soldiers this year , and will easily break that next year , is proof that we are stretching these young men and women to the breaking point . All this underlies Hank's ( Tommy Lee Jones ) desire to find his son , and then find out why he was killed . Just the presence of Jones gives a movie three stars , and this Oscar-nominated performance is no exception . His face may be craggy , but he still has the same steely determination of Marshal Samuel Gerard in The Fugitive and U . S . Marshals . His performance of writer / director Paul Haggis ' script was utterly amazing . He was almost overshadowed by the outstanding performance of Charlize Theron ( Monster , North Country ) . As a victim of a sexist police force , she has to work doubly hard to prove her worth , and prove it she does in this film . It is getting to the point that her name also guarantees a film to be worth watching just for her presence alone . America may not be ready for war films about Iraq , but anyone who still thinks we should be there needs to see this film .
434163	2171244	44741	9.0	How tragic that man can never realize how beautiful life is until he is face to face with death .	The opening of this film was just what everyone would think of bureaucracies that we deal with every day . The people wanted a park and they just got shuffled from one office to another . No one wanted to do anything that they could later be criticized for . Wantanabe ( Takashi Shimura ) was no different . He spent 30 years in government and rose to section chief without doing a thing . He just came to work every day and avoided " rocking the boat . " His life was so boring that others called him " The Mummy . " When he found out that he had stomach cancer and less than a year to live , he searched for something to give his life meaning . He went out with a writer ( Yûnosuke Itô ) to bars and strip clubs to find something , but it wasn't enough . He started hanging around with a young office worker ( Miki Odagiri ) who gave him pleasure ( non sexual , you pervert ) until she was tired of being with him . But , before she left him , she gave him an idea , and he started his life anew trying to build that park . Even as a Section Chief , taking on the bureaucracy was an uphill battle . We do not see the struggle until after he dies and all the other functionaries at his wake start telling his story as they try to figure out why he did what he did . Kurosawa and Shimura gave us a treasure about life and one that would do us well to watch over and over . Sacrificing yourself to serve the many . What a message !
434539	2171244	51378	9.0	Outstanding Film Noir	I tried to watch Jeanne Moreau in François Truffaut's Jules and Jim the same day I saw this . I really tried and , despite the fact that it was the best Europen film of 1963 and Truffaut won a couple of awards for directing it , I couldn't make it more that a half hour . It was just plain boring . Not so with this film noir classic . Jeanne Moreau was simply captivating as a woman who was having an affair and could not figure out what went wrong with the murder of her husband and why her lover played by Maurice Ronet ( The Scandal ) was driving away with another woman . What she didn't know was that he was actually trapped in an elevator and his car was stolen by some young kids . What happens to the kids and the effect on the adulterous couple was totally captivating . This was film noir at its best and director Louis Malle gave us a classic worth watching again and again .
434097	2171244	75314	9.0	De Niro was outstanding !	I actually saw this for the first time this morning . I couldn't sleep and it was on at 4am . It was every bit as good as I was led to believe . Comparing the two , I cannot see how this lost to Rocky at the Academy Awards . Scorsese fans will also agree that he deserved a directing award for this film . While De Niro and Foster were fantastic , I feel that Cybill Shepherd was equally good , and should have been recognized for her performance . This film won 18 awards out of 27 nominations . Basically only the Academy didn't get on the bandwagon . But , in all those nominations , none for Sheperd . I really think that was wrong . Great film , and I will watch it again and again .
432161	2171244	335266	9.0	It's better the second time around	Sometimes I watch a movie and I just don't get it . The accolades flowed for this one and I really couldn't see what all the fuss was about . Maybe it is the deadpan way that Bill Murray plays his characters . He just seems so emotionless to me . I watched it again this morning and it made perfect sense to me . It was an extremely funny movie that showed how things do get Lost in Translation . Not only the obvious cultural differences from the land of my birth and the land of my heritage , but the differences between men and women . Not only was it a funny film , but it was sweet and tender at the same time and the obstacles were overcome in the end to where both understood each other perfectly .
433853	2171244	118607	10.0	An amazing story of history and freedom	While theatergoers in 1997 were being amazed by special effects on another ship , this magnificent story given to us by the master director Steven Spielberg gives us the true story of our country and what it means to be American . We are not free as long as one of us is in chains . As John Quincy Adams ( Anthony Hopkins ) so eloquently put it , " . . . what are we to do with that embarrassing , annoying document , The Declaration of Independence ? What of its conceits ? " All men created equal , " " inalienable rights , " " life , liberty , " and so on and so forth ? " The Civil War was , indeed , the last battle of The American Revolution . What a cast ! You can search for Fool's Gold or you can watch Matthew McConaughey in her greatest performance as the lawyer who risked it all . Djimon Hounsou may Never Back Down this year , as he certainly didn't in this film . Morgan Freeman certainly knows about " Freedom : A History of Us " and he helped the Africans find theirs . One of the very best films I have ever seen .
433092	2171244	401383	10.0	Cinema at it's finest .	Seldom do we get to see such a beautiful and moving picture . Director Julian Schnabel ( Before Night Falls ) and writer Ronald Harwood ( The Pianist ) gave us a story that warms the heart and makes us appreciate just what we have in life . " . . . two things aren't paralyzed , my imagination and my memory . " We get to share both in a fashion that was dazzling , largely due to the outstanding camera work of Janusz Kaminski ( Saving Private Ryan , Schilndler's list ) . Kaminski's work makes me more excited to see Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull , on which he also did the cinematography . Mathieu Amalric was magnificent as Jean-Dominique ' Jean-Do ' Bauby . Even when he was imagining , we saw almost everything through his eyes . Schnabel gave us a perspective that made the acting of Amalric seem so real . Emmanuelle Seigner ( La Vie en rose , The Ninth Gate ) was also magnificent as the mother of Jean-Do's children . There was always a sensuality present in her appearances , and the scene where she had to translate a cal from his latest mistress was excruciating to watch . Anne Consigny was also amazing to watch as Claude , who translated the book for Jean-Do . This is one of the best films I have seen this years - no , it is the BEST film I have seen this year .
432789	2171244	78788	10.0	Oh man , the sht piled up so fast in Vietnam you needed wings to stay above it .	This film deserved every single award it got , and deserved some that it didn't get . The winners for Best Picture and Best Director and best supporting Actor paled in comparison to this film and Driector Francis Ford Coppola , and Robert Duvall's portrayal as Lt Col Kilgore . Duvall's performance was just one of some really great performances in this film . Martin Sheen held it all together ; a young Laurence Fishburne , Albert Hall , Aurore Clément in her prime , Dennis Hopper , so many more that it is hard to mention them . Naturally , we have to mention the absolutely brilliant performance of Marlon Brando . The music and cinematography were first rate , worthy of the many accolades they received . " The Ride of the Valkyries " will forever be associated with this film . The stunt work was also superb . Every aspect of this film stands out as a classic right up there with Gone With the Wind .
