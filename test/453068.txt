508591	453068	420128	1.0	a total contrived aberration of a TV movie , not because of its sincerity , but . . . well , maybe that is a big part of it	Riding the Bus with My Sister is a shameless attempt to put up such an insane sequence of events into a two-hour-plus-commercials time slot to total up to this : Beth ( Rosie O'Donnell ) is inspiring and courageous and livens up those lives of people around her , and anyone who doesn't see otherwise can shove it . But the opposite is true , particularly due to the performance , though the writing doesn't help . It's not within the power of a filmmaker to make something that doesn't draws the viewer compassionately in , as LONG AS it doesn't try and think the viewers themselves are , to use the word bluntly , retarded . But Angelica Huston , who doesn't seem to do her late-father proud when it comes to taking the director's chair , plops on the sentiment when really what is being revealed is the wildly contrived story of a control freak who's mean and annoying and , at the end of it all , unsympathetic . This might be passing a lot of judgment on O'Donnell's character , who was based on a real person , but it's not without some notice . Beth might be one of the most irritating characters in recent memory , in TV or elsewhere . This doesn't mean some ( totally unintentional ) laughs aren't to be had at the expense of the totally dingbat turn from O'Donnell . Maybe it's method , maybe it's just playing it in a very horrific one-note way , but she doesn't do anything to help make this big goose who doesn't seem to notice that the ones who point out that she's loud and obnoxious might be the correct ones . No , the point of view of the filmmakers control that more than anything , wherein it's all either black or white : either people really respect and care for her ( the black tae-kwan-do student who has the Isaac Hayes look is never explained really as to why he's with her aside from ' she makes me laugh , I love her , blah blah ' ) , or they're dismayed by her rude quality , like when she's at the cafeteria the bus drivers are at and , after the umpteenth time she's been there , is yelled at by one of the other drivers to get out as it's the BUS DRIVERS section . It would be one thing if the writer tried to make this as some legitimate dramatic scene , but it's all played up like " people just don't understand , " which is accentuated by the whole relationship between the two sisters . Now , it's not that McDowell doesn't try a little with the part , but what is there to be given to her anyway ? Her part is meant as a lazy counterpoint to Beth's half-crazy half-stupid mindset . She's a career woman who is a photographer ( not very well apparently , even when she makes " arty " photos in black and white ) , who puts aside her career , and her boyfriend , to stay with Beth after the death of their father . Rainman , however , this surely is not ; the story has very little in the way of actual development , except for the most base and totally , despicably predictable points , with O'Donnell grinding on through in a performance that gives cringe-worthy a bad name ( or a good name , I guess ) . Even the flashbacks are ridiculously inept at showing anything aside from ' I didn't really care for my sister then , and I should've , as it took my father about my entire adolescence to move out of the house ' , in a gray Flags of Our Fathers tint of course . This is all capped off with a final section where Beth tries to contemplate having children . At this point , against my better judgment , I soldiered on to the end , with rests on a shot of Beth , her sister , and the " hot " bus driver all in a goofy pose . If you have the guts to go through it , just make sure to know there's many " laughs , tears , hugs , etc " , complete with the sappiest guitar pluckings this side of Eric Clapton after watching a puppy die , and an atmosphere of total dread where there should be some rays of happiness for these people for the audience . No such luck ; it's a Hallmark movie at its most exploitative .
510079	453068	59464	1.0	barely watchable on it's own ; one of the MST3K's best commentaries though	Monster a Go-Go is one of those dreaded would-be drive-in cash-in movies that trying to watch it on its own is an act in futility . Trying to watch the moments of bad actors reciting bad dialog on sets loaned out by the director's mother and featuring the one hook as a 7 foot 6 inch man who's made to look TALLER in the ridiculous high-angle shots is excruciating enough . But then there's also the narrator sounding like he should be reading copy off of an industrial short on the history of buttons , the nearly inaudible dialog read in outdoor scenes , the random scene with the kids dancing at the hall to rock AND roll music , the atrocious ( let me repeat that , atrocious ) lighting where , as the Mystery Science Theater guys observe , their faces have been burned off , and an ending that wraps things up like a tarp scotch taped around a 400 pound dead guy who left this Earth by leprosy . It's a wretched work of science fiction that talks too much , doesn't walk the walk , and tries to compensate with lots of shots of tanks and army men and stuff cause , you know , that's impressive to the kiddies in these flicks . Luckily , Joel , Crow and Tom Servo are to the rescue with their commentary , and it is definitely one of the best that they recorded in the Joel era . Most comments are just plain silly ( their number with John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt , or just the echoing of the goofy sounds of the soundtrack are classic ) , but there are many a harsh , cutting word against the flick too . I loved just seeing how at the opening credits they acknowledged it would suck - " Hey , heh , hey guys , see Bill Rebane , two of them , shows up once , then again , and . . . oh this is going to suck " . It might seem a little biased that at the end , something unusual , they actually boo the movie ( not undeserved , but still ) , and up until before it ends keep asking when the hell it will end . But throughout I kept on either chuckling out just rolling-on-the-floor laughing at not just the specific little throwaway gags or lines that are too obscure for some , but just how it would match up to certain parts ( i . e . starts to fall asleep , Narrator chimes in , they all startle to wake up ) .
509927	453068	116756	1.0	Shaq's egomania OOZES off of this movie ; a notorious bad kids movie , and not as campy as one would wish	Yes , Kazaam is one of those horribly bad movies that almost reminds one of everything that is wrong with not just kids movies , but with humanity . Here we have Shaq as a rapping genie - yes , a RAPPING genie - where he does everything from making bad puns to dressing in ridiculous outfits , all ending in him in a Christ-like pose with lots of light surrounding him . So , yeah , expect really cheesy bits , including the first wish being a lot of junk food falling down from the sky ( and , regrettably , not knocking out the two main characters , particularly the kid ) . What might not be expected is that a film with a kid and Shaquille O'Neill would be so incredibly schmaltzy ! The main plot of the film involves this kid , played in that all-too-typical and annoying-kid fashion by the great-grandson of Frank Capra ( where in which the kid is yelling out his dialog angrily ) , who comes upon a genie who's been trapped in a boom-box . Then " hiarity ensues " as the kid makes the Shaq-genie his quasi-slave as he waits on his last two wishes as he tries to make amends with his shady-gang-type absentee father . This really sappy , contrived son and father story would be bad enough , as there are certain lines that have been uttered in a million other movies ( i . e . the " two chances in life " speech from father to son ) . But it's Shaquille O'Neill who is both the reason to watch the film ( ironically ) , and the obvious sinking crux of it all . His plot line involves him , when not getting the over-talky treatment from Capra , to rap within the dialog and also start off his blossoming recording career . On top of this , he also kicks ass and takes names with the main bad guys who want him back in the boom-box . So is there a camp factor to the movie ? Up to a point , but this is even squashed by all of the mushy scenes and ' heart-felt ' moments that have really no business with the rest of the material . One might ask if the people making the movie , who were obviously doing it at the behest of the popularity of a BASKETBALL player who wanted to go on the Michael Jordan acting bandwagon , if it would be anywhere near decently entertaining or convincing . I'd hope that they too knew they were just getting paid . But I'd hope even more that they felt at least a little guilty afterwords for feeding the Shaq-machine . So , if you want to have a fun night of Shaq as genie - turned - rapper - turned - wisecracker , all the more fun to you . Hell , it might even be interesting to have a Shaq movie night with this and his other critically acclaimed effort Steel . But if you're hoping to keep a few brain cells , stay away from what is very likely the worst flick of 1996 , and a candidate among many others for worst of the 90's .
509698	453068	299981	2.0	not at all undeserving of its straight-to-Sci-fi-channel-status	I just looked back at my notes on Highland : Endgame , still the only other Highlander movie I've yet to see ( also never seen an episode of the show ) , and an a little surprised at how high it was rated then even at a grade . I must have reacted to the final battle scene between Adrian Paul and Christopher Lambert , which is the only thing I can even recall from the one time seeing the film , and finding it kind of cool in a cheesy , disposable science-fiction flick manner . But the fact that it is so forgettable shouldn't be taken for granted , at the very least in what has come AFTER THE ENDGAME ! According to a friend each Highlander film gets even more disconnected and continuity confused than the last , and The Source is probably one of those textbook examples of a story being simply way too confusing for one who isn't at least a little familiar with the franchise . And at the same time , seeing it tonight on the Sci-fi cable channel , it's not totally out of place , and maybe not quite as offensive as some of the product made right in their home premises . But it's still a waste of any viewer's time , even for die-hard fans . The only real value at all to be taken from the movie , and there is maybe a little bit , may be in aspects , in parts , of craftsmanship , like the make-up on Pyramidhead and the cinematography , the latter calling into mind ( oddly enough as I'm not kidding ) Pan's Labyrinth , of course without much at all of the power of the context that film had in style and substance . But once that is past , then one is left with direction that seems to come out of a school that is based entirely on a time when MTV still made music videos , with touches of would-be 300 knock-off thrown in either as unintentional or as sucker-punching for genre fans . And acting that is just fair at best and atrocious at worst ( Adrian Paul can act , says who ? And the guy that plans the Pyramidhead , what gives ? ) But what made it most incredulous was the editing ; since the story is filled with many a cliché ( dying man gives his long monologue to teary-eyed hero , longer monologue from a disgusting creature about what is to come in the rest of the story , sex scene between hero and girl after a heart-to-heart , final duel , et all ) , the editing should at least try for professionalism of some sort . Not so . This director / editor team is about as toxic as Steven Tyler and Joe Perry in a 1978 hotel room loaded with five 8-balls a piece and a one hooker between the two of them . Often during a fight the characters will be shot as if in slow motion and SPED up , and then back and forth as if there isn't any conviction in just seeing simple fight choreography . But worse are the montages - aside from Bratz , which is in a league of its own , this is some of the just , well , inept editing I've seen in many a moon , particularly at the beginning and end where it seems as though nobody even watched the fing last ths of the movie that came before or after it ! The music is also another kicker to go with the director's scheme of assault on cinematic style . By the time it ends - which seems to be longer than it really is despite the long commercial breaks . The only good news that can come is that The Source has now been reached , and the series can now end , like another beheaded immortal or whatever the hell .
510516	453068	490204	3.0	Reinging and ringing over my head	It's basically impossible not to consider the tragedy of as the most significant event of a nightmare day on American soil . At the least it tore up New York city , and left many lives devastated . The writer / director of Reign Over Me , Mike Binder , tries to set up a form of critic-proof shield around his film by making the central tragedy for his protagonist that his family - wife , daughters - were killed on one of the planes in and for years has slipped into a horrible funk that has made him delusional and pretty close to schizophrenic . It's not using for a movie that is troubling ; films like United 93 and to a lesser extent World Trade Center benefited from facing the horror of the day head on . It's using it for this particular tragedy for this man's life . At first it's almost more of a plot device : since it was victims , the government paid out a huge amount to Charlie Fineman ( Sandler ) , so that he can still live in his apartment , refurnish the kitchen as he argued with his wife over on their last phone call , and play video games and jam out on classic rock without the worry of not having a job . Unlike , for example , the Fisher King , where the psychotic widower was also homeless , this solves the problem of dealing with monetary status . But then , as the character develops , it becomes more of a nuisance than anything . There's no depth developed within this situation aside from Charlie not dealing with the loss of his family , and what's explored in the friendship that's reconnected with Dr . Johnson ( Cheadle ) , his ex college roommate , is really bizarre and unamusing at the least and just plain stupid at worst . The way that the two connect rings false on counts of writing and directing , if not all the way on performance . Which leads to the two biggest flaws in this colossal waste , as the two feed into one another : Mike Binder's writing and Sandler's performance . I'm not one to say that Sandler can't act , on the contrary his turn in Punch-Drunk Love is revelatory , and I've even enjoyed him replaying practically the same persona in his string of comic star vehicles ( with a few obvious exceptions i . e . Click , Eight Crazy Nights ) . Here , however , he plays it all as incredulously one-note . You truly want to feel sympathy for the character - some will , to be sure - but Sandler blights this by not giving us anything to see that he wasn't always this cantankerous and crazy and demented . As clichéd as it might've been , albeit on top of the others included in the piece , a flashback wouldn't of hurt aside from the brief blips of his former life . It's such a misstep in perceiving tones of scenes , playing things for goofy laughs and drama sometimes in the same beat . Only a highly charged scene involving a gun carries any leverage in the acting department . But then the other problem , the writing , drives down most of the potential in the piece . I would be interested in seeing a film that explores some of the dimensions of a character coping with deep-rotted grief , yet not in this ham-fisted manner . On top of how Binder deals with Charlie's trauma , there's the friendship aspect , which attempts to pull some dimension for Cheadle's character . To his credit , Cheadle does give it his best , but much of the script asks him to go from being rational ( i . e . dealing with that on / off sexual harassment charge ) to being freewheeling and taking Charlie as a kind of guide to living how one wants to ( i . e . going against family ) . It becomes so frustrating that by the time some of the logical steps come closer - the psychiatric treatment Charlie does need , and is entitled to get - it's almost so out of reach for one to care from the blocks in the material . It's contrivance of plot details , it's contrivance of character , and it's a total sham and manipulation by the time of an unbelievable catharsis . It's simply not a good movie , or at the very least overrated .
508682	453068	377471	3.0	probably one of my least favorite films from 2005 ; not memorable at all	You might think with a cast as large as this , with a mix of big-name actors ( Travolta , Thurman , Keitel , Vaughn ) , music people and other pop culture people ( Andre Benjamin , The Rock , Cedric the Entertainer ) , that it might just be worth watching for them if not funny from the material . But it's not either much funny or really memorable for its cast . When presented with such a group of talent such as this , you know you'll either get something special or something of a downer , and its unfortunate that the latter applies . This is based on an Elmore Leonard book , but it didn't seem as if F . Gary Gray payed attention to getting the right rhythm in the comedy , or just getting the right people for the characters , as Barry Sonnenfeld did with his 1995 film Get Shorty . This time , basically , Chili Palmer ( Travolta ) is in the music industry instead of movies , and he gets involved with a woman ( Thurman sexy in her first scene , though not bringing much else throughout the film ) , and also through wanting to get an R & B singer ( Christina Milan ) to the attentions of producers . But , of course , there are problems on the crime end of the spectrum , involving Keitel and Vaughn , and the Rock . Unfortunately , I can't really tell you much else I can recall from Be Cool , as the story itself isn't much of interest . A couple of individual jokes and lines here and there might muster up a laugh or a grin , but nothing amounts to much , and the filmmaker doesn't seem capable of balancing the varying styles that the actors might be able to bring along with the cooky , deterring story . It's a movie also more concerned with its supporting characters than its lead ( s ) . And one might start to feel a little bit of grimace as Travolta and Thurman once again shake it up on the dance floor , but with something missing from their first outing over a decade ago . Be Cool isn't an unpleasant experience , but it borders on it , as the comedy often hits flatter than expected , and even an actor like Keitel , who I would see in just about anything , can't bring anything to his part . You know there's something a little off when the Rock provides more laughs than anyone else in the picture .
509928	453068	70948	3.0	so , Sean Connery didn't understand the Matrix , but this movie . . .	Zardoz is , quite frankly , one of the all-time champion ' train-wreck ' type films I've seen from the 70's , or for that matter any decade . Which means , in short , it's the kind of unbridled cinematic mess that only someone coming right off of the success of Deliverance would even dare of doing . Part of me was thinking while watching this film " what is this director thinking , or trying to even pass off as connecting with the themes ? NONE of this makes sense ! " Then even when I grasped the basic gist of the plot ( if there even is one ) of Connery playing some rogue killer who gets trapped into a ' vortex ' where everyone lives and doesn't die but can get old and can't have sex and blah blah , I and the friends watching this with me kept muttering " oh my God " . In a way it is actually watchable in that very campy , bad-movie sense . There are few bad movies , with the exceptions of Plan 9 and Manos , that contain so many laughs in just the first twenty minutes or so ( unintentionally of course , as it's all played very seriously and self-importantly ) . I mean , even before the opening credits roll we get a ) a giant floating mask-head , b ) random lines referring to the powers of guns and dangers of male genitals , and c ) Connery just shooting at the screen . It only gets better ( or worse depending on your point of view ) from there . Also co-starring is Charlotte Rampling ( and boy has she had better days ) as one of the members of the ' vortex ' who ends up becoming rather close with the main beast-of-burden , so to speak ( and yes , it's rather stupefyingly amazing that his name is ' Zed ' ) . Zardoz is one of those very pure , and of course then intrinsically doomed , cult-of-the-moment pictures , where a filmmaker given carte Blanche by a studio pours out something that is so personal , so strange , and so corrupted by self-indulgence , it's either big hit or dangerous miss . While I would consider this film to be apart of the latter , I didn't necessarily have a bad time watching the film . I knew what I was getting into , for example , just by the theatrical trailer . It's got some of that of-the-times psychedelia working in there , and sequences that utilize slow-motion , instant replay , Zed inside a big , uh , crystal thing , and other outrageous feats of sci-fi cinema . Those who might rate it rather high are likely bigger buffs than I , or maybe can take not only the story seriously but take the style with a grain of salt . But in looking at this today , and especially at a leading man who is looking way too much like Burt Reynolds for comfort , this is one of the more frustrating , deranged , and ironically hilarious films of its time , a kind of ambitious peak into ' what-the-f " film-making that you rarely get anymore .
508590	453068	780571	4.0	is too mediocre to be a camp classic , but you might have some laughs at the filmmaker / actors ' expense	Mr . Brooks brings out its bag of tricks early on , but its a bag that's sort of moldy and with the scent of contentment with the average as opposed to more outrageous tendencies . It was a good time for the wrong reasons during the film , a vehicle for Kevin Costner to try to make a grasp at star-defiance of type ( instead of a hero he's a killer , woo , big leap ) , but I wondered if maybe the writers would've fared better if they hadn't gone on to make it a " legitimate " thriller . The aspect to the Costner / William Hurt dynamic , where it's a blatantly obvious contrivance of the script where almost every scene without Brooks with a different person in the room or other to talk to is with Hurt's character of Brooks's ego , or Id , or whatever Freudian tick-tack may apply . Some of there scenes , however stupid they might be ( including one where Costner cries , have mercy ) , show some interesting bits and pieces of psychological unease between the two , as if it's been too long that Brooks has listened to his egger-on and doubting Thomas , but still does as the two have wicked laughs at the possibilities of murder and deceit . However , it's director / co-writer Bruce Evans's idea to make Mr . Brooks crammed with the typical elements of a mystery-thriller involving a serial killer , and in some equally expected and inane ways . Demi Moore's character is the given , the tough pro who is saddled with her other motivation that she has to crack the case or else be fired due to a divorce case happening the same time ( this is a totally inexplicable plot line made so that Moore can act even more ' tough ' , and to eventually tie it into the Brooks killing line ) . Then there's Dane Cook , who doesn't act so much as just use his sort of twitchy ' skills ' at acting like he can act to play the almost blackmailing photographer who catches Brooks in the act of killing two of his latest , and then is brought along by Brooks to see someone else get killed . On top of this , we get the ' other wise ' to Brooks's life , which is that he's a legitimate businessman and a loving husband and father , the latter of which to a girl who may turn out to be as dysfunctional as him , in the worst ways possible . Instead of possibly giving the characters and developing situations much serious thought , Evans and his co-writer make it all too ridiculous to take as something more interesting , and at the same time tries to make it a conventional thriller to make it experimental . Although Evans isn't necessarily incompetent as a craftsman with the camera - there are , in fact , many well done shots in darkness and silhouettes and other moody scenes of Brooks in his dark home or in thought or Moore swimming in the pool - the story is just too stupid to really make it on either side , with some minor exceptions ( the moment when Cook's " Mr . Smith " finds the newspaper in the car with the words circled to spell out instructions , to his total anger , is hilarious ) , and the actors are left with material to flounder in . Cosnter can show his talents from time to time , but again he's saddled himself to a work that might have at some point allowed him for extra room to challenge himself , but in the end he almost challenges his audience to actually see if he has anything , at all , going on emotion-wise , which is next to none . William Hurt takes a nose-dive following his smashing Oscar nomination a couple years ago . Moore is , well , the usual , not bad but nothing more worthy of potential . And Cook is close to being a non-entity in a role that should require more chutzpah . In short , wait for TV , real late night I'm - drunk - and - there's - nothing - else - on TV , for this mainstream clap-trap .
510507	453068	71396	4.0	definitely not a good movie , but could it have been better ? maybe	Willard Huyuck , and collaborator / wife Gloria Katz , never got a career going like buddy George Lucas . As a writer they got to pen some of his works ( American Graffiti and Temple of Doom , even allegedly some uncredited work on the first Star Wars ) , but on their own turned out mostly either bad work , like here , or fun bad work like Howard the Duck . Messiah of Evil , as was titled when I watched it , is a muddled picture about a woman who comes to her artist father's seaside home , only to find he's not around but has left a lot of notes about the horrors that have come unto the area , and soon enough there's dead people coming out at night to claim those around the area . It's muddled , for one thing , because the way the dialog is presented , sometimes in narration and sometimes just badly recorded , comes off like its meant to be amateurish ( or , at best , right out of a MST3K movie ) , not to mention in the bulk of the performances ( albeit character actor Elisha Cooke Jr pops up for a couple of scenes as a town nut ) . And yet , even with the overall flaws of the film , plus the silly concept of a blood-red moon and all that nonsense with the design of the house , there are some notes that hint at a better movie . Shots like the one looking down that white corridor with the figure at the end , or the one girl wandering through the empty streets with a red tint , or the big horror scenes at the supermarket or an even creepier scene at the movie theater . These are interesting bits that show some artistic promise on the part of Huyuck and Katz . Unfortunately , as it would seem , these bits don't add up to anything substantial for either a guilty pleasure or as something so trashy that it would work as some bizarre cult film . It's probably forgettable by most film-goers for a reason ( or , for that matter , why it was found by me on a double-feature Alpha video DVD with Sisters of Death ) . Not the worst , but not good , it's 70's knock-off drek .
510762	453068	448011	4.0	one word can describe this movie for non Bible-thumpers : cracked	Attending a Saturday night screening for Knowing in its second weekend of release I noticed that the theater was fully packed . My first thought was that since it is a Nicolas Cage movie and from the commercials and previews looks to be pretty blockbuster-action style stuff happening that it might make for a good weekend night viewing . But as the movie went into its last couple of reels I had to wonder : did these folks really know what they were getting into here ? Did they realize beforehand , and approve , of how much Knowing takes its BIG plot points and some of its themes from Revelations and Genesis ? Or that for most of the running time what's going on takes such a giant leap from science-fiction into conspiracy-nut territory ? It's hard not to talk about what happens in the ending , but I may have to by the end of this review . First a summary : a widowed MIT professor ( Nicolas Cage , a usually good actor looking faker every movie with his cropped plant hair and plastic surgery ) looks at a page that his son got from an " unearthing " of a Time Capsule that an elementary school left underground for 50 years to be discovered in present day . The page is just numbers , but there's a pattern . It's freaky : the numbers signal catastrophes ( i . e . with 2996 people dead ) , and it leads to other possibilities , such as what the other numbers that seem to not pose any kind of meaning at all mean - and it leads , eventually , to Cage discovering what it all leads to . . . Yup , you guessed it , end of the world . Not just Earth but all planets in the our solar system . The frustrating thing though in Knowing is that for at least a short while there is some promise in the material . Sure , it's kooky to see Cage going through all those numbers like a nut - it makes the Number 23 look almost reasonable in comparison - but Alex Proyas , the director , makes things tense and strange and possibly leading to something complex . In fact the first half contains a relatively awesome sequence : Cage is stuck in traffic and an airplane crashes right across the highway , and he runs through the wreckage with people burning and flailing about and it's all in one shot . Some may not notice that it is all in one shot , which makes it all the more remarkable a feat of direction ( the visual FX are compelling too ) ; it's practically Children of Men amazement in terms of a single visual demonstration of a nightmare on film . But then as more of the plot unfolds - it would appear as if the grown-up kids from Twilight are after Cage's son , not a good actor at all I should add , for some reason and even give him a vision of hell that is half nifty and half bat-s crazy , and it also involves a small black stone - it becomes silly in some part ( it doesn't help that Cage has moments of total calamity as an actor like when he's swinging the bat wildly or is totally bland in quieter scenes ) , and in large part just . . . I don't know what . It's leading to something that should be either a wild revelation or so preposterous that it makes the last four or five of Cage's movies ( i . e . Wicker Man , Ghost Rider , Bangkok Dangerous ) look sane and easy in comparison . Turns out , you'll either be in awe - and you know who you are ( i . e . Christian wackos , Rogert Ebert ) - or scratching your head . I was in the latter , but there's some sliver of me that wishes I wasn't just nearly losing it , laughing in my seat while everyone else was calm and accepting what was going on in front of them . There is some potential here to become a camp hit , something that would give the Mystery Science Theater guys a run for their money with the commentary . But it takes itself so seriously , and also has some scenes and sequences of actual good , intelligent direction from Proyas and his FX crew , that it turns into what it is : another Nic Cage movie mess that ends on such a note to make both Danny Boyle and Darren Aronofsky raise up their pitchforks and scream ENOUGH ! LEAVE THE SUN AND THE TREE OF LIFE ALONE ! If you're looking for it to be something totally wild and unhinged at least for the last quarter you'll get your money's worth . If you're looking for another masterpiece from the director of the Crow and Dark City ( or for that matter Cage's big-budget comeback ) , look elsewhere .
510387	453068	295206	5.0	to say it's corny , is . . . . nevermind	Cornman ! A superhero that we can all get around ! That is , if one actually watches the movie , which might be very , very , very few , as the movie wasn't even made by Troma ( although Lloyd does introduce the movie on the DVD , with full corn up the you-know-what gag thrown in ) . It was the first movie by Barak Epstein , and you can tell it was made on the fly , without much actual things like money , good props , make-up , actors , sets , etc . But somehow they made this very bad movie into something that is unusually fun and stupid and self-conscious . One scene that works very well on a level reminiscent ( if not anywhere as good ) of Return of the Killer Tomatoes is when the ' fourth wall ' is broken and the film crew is seen . The director goes up to the actor playing Cornman - horrible actor , of course - and tells him this won't work , and puts in another more muscle-bound actor in his place , and suddenly the fights get better , the guy is not a half-bad Cornman ( if there could be a half-good Cornman ) , and it's a good little rib-jab to the audience that it's knowing it sucks , and it rolls along with the crap-shoot . At the least , Cornman is worth watching , aside from the general badness of it , for the little things , like the villain with his blade covered in cellophane , or for the sidekick who's only function is to smell with his Pinocchio nose , or for the um , yeah , lesbian shower scene that turns pretty violent ( and hilarious ) involving a hose . It threatens at times to become too boring , but for those who want to stick with it the pleasures are all Mystery Science Theater bound . It's so bad it flips to good , then back-flips back to bad again , and then ends somewhat in the middle . Not worth a dollar , more like . . . 5 cents ?
510766	453068	118636	6.0	not bad , but might have had more potential , somehow	Apt Pupil is a film I might possibly consider watching again , if I didn't have much to do during the day and had absolutely nothing else to watch ( including TV ) . It's one of those transitional films for a director - in this case Bryan Singer - where from one film that's a success to another there's a bridge in the middle that kind of floats and fizzles before getting a closer look . But it's possible too , as I remember it , that part of my problem initially with the film wasn't as much with Singer's work as a director as it was with ( some of ) the writing . Stephen King's story has a lot of potential , and its idea could have different directions in the scope of the tragedy and aftermath-style horror that comes with a Nazi survivor in everyday America . There could even be a Hitchcok element to it as well , with a man who has evil stored somewhere inside and now in a very average , American town ( and , indeed , what evil thoughts might lie in such average-town inhabitants ) And some of that potential is tapped , primarily in the very tense , underplayed exchanges between Brad Renfro and ( of course ) Ian McKellan . In fact , I would most likely watch the film again more than any other reason for McKellan , who is good as usual ( if not great ) , and tries his best to elevate the complexities of such a character like Kurt Dussander for the audience . But , again , the problem goes back to the writing , as in the third act the film goes completely off into more of a horror movie mode leaving some of the more serious and interesting questions left to muck around in the scenes where Dussander goes off the deep end . And , some of the horror brought to the film ( and I would guesstimate most of it is from King's original story ) is sub-par itself . King has written some great stories dealing with the horrors of humanity in the ' real ' world , but Apt Pupil isn't one of them . With all of the effort put in by Renfro as the wayward , typically curious ( and in this case un-hinged ) teen , McKellan as the understanding and interesting but later truly monstrous figure , and Singer's competent direction , it's a shame then that the material itself wasn't totally taken into account . Worth a viewing once , at least for King die-hards who may find some extra enjoyment from seeing at least one unforgettable scene ( where McKellan puts back on the uniform and gets into the ' mood ' of the old-times ) , but it's far from being one of the better Nazi war criminal movies .
509639	453068	78056	6.0	it has its moments . . . and then it also doesn't	Paradise Alley is set in 1946 in the dingy and dirty streets of Hell's Kitchen - or the Bowery , take your pick , maybe more like the Bowery - and is centered on a group of characters , specifically three brothers , and how they try to maintain in their squalor or , as it turns out , try and make a way for themselves to get out . It's a sentimental picture as it tries to act super tough and muscular , and it's kind of like a Saturday afternoon movie for the guys who have already seen Rocky and Rambo flicks too many times and want to see something sort of " different " . It certainly is . And not always in a good way . What I liked was seeing how the actors playing the brothers interacted . Cosmo , Victor and Lenny are impressionable and work very well as this trio dynamic . One had high aspirations and has a big mouth but a fairly good heart , another is a crippled war hero who's life has not worked out at all like he might have wanted for himself or his girl , and the other is a fairly content and BIG-sized ice delivery man who finds himself needing money to want that boat house . I liked also how Stallone put these characters against the lumbering idiot gangsters who were too bumbling to really make it as big-shots but could be threatening enough to other bums and the like in the neighborhood . Not to mention the character and performance of Frank McRae as the 40-something wrestler who lives in total degradation even as he's very good at what he does . Oh , and Tom Waits of course , for a role that is merely a blip but one that brings a smile all the same . The problems seem to come for Stallone that he isn't confident enough to take the material where it needs to go as a down-and-dirty grungy street flick . He gussies it up with over-blown camera moves and editing tricks ( I hated the freeze-screen effects used ) , and seem to not always be as strong with dealing with melodrama and the natural way people talk as he did in the first Rocky . If there was a time to make this story maybe it was right after he has his first big success , and then move on to more conventional stuff . But it is at times fairly schmaltzy , and not all of the acting is very good ( the female actresses are all pretty weak , and for a couple of good scenes Lee Canalito feel really flat as the " happy " wreslter brother dubbed " The Salami " ) . Stallone and Asante fare better with the material , and even Stallone himself goes hammy with his own words in some scenes ; Stallone is Stallone , not a Pacino or De Niro , so heavy-duty dramatic scenes don't seem to cut it out as well . And yet , the film does have its moments . I especially dug that final wrestling match , the two contenders ( the other being , I think , Terry Funk ) duking it out as a rain storm is coming down in the arena and the power keeps cutting in and out with lightning effects thrown in . Stallone does make this an epic and nasty and brutal final bout , and it does bring a pretty satisfying completion to a film that is enjoyable but too clichéd by half .
508178	453068	65760	6.0	" Arrow-feather ! "	Roger Corman's Gas-s-s-s , his final film as director for AIP , is dated ( and probably even was for the period it got released ) , but somehow it's almost part of its charm . It's an irreverent comedy about a noxious gas that wipes out everybody - at least in the US much as we can figure - who's over the age of 25 . Party-time ! In what appears to be , in the premise , as a slight twist on Corman's own Last Woman on Earth , it's an epic of low-budget proportions , a rampant fiasco of kids in hippie-wear ( or not as case turns out ) and the Darwinian struggles that take place as the roughnecks , jocks and bikers-on-country-clubs face off against those darn ' commie-anarchists ' . Certainly a good premise indeed , at least for those who love the exploitation fare of the period ( myself counted , even as I'm from after that era ) . While it might be one of Corman's ( intentionally ) funnier pictures , there's a nagging feeling that something's not totally there . It is cheap , it is slapdash , it's episodic . The problem , as with some of Corman's other movies , is that a little more effort would make something even more interesting . If there was , for example , another snappy and sharp writer alongside George Armitage , who could whip the script into a tight and awesome shape , it could even be one of the great exploitation films . As it stands , it's merely OK overall . Luckily the good tries to outweigh the bad , which is that there are some really , actually clever one-liners ( " Hey , we all have our own inconsistencies , that doesn't stop the revolution , " to " Drop that chloride , you commie anarchist ! " ) and seeing the biker country-clubbers and the God lightning bolt climax . Best of all is to see a running-gag in-joke for Corman - probably more than one , actually . The first is more obvious , and laugh-out-loud , which is a biker Edgar Allen Poe , who just shows up here and there like some sage wise-man ( who is , of course , not over 25 ) with his wife and occasional raven on his shoulder spouting garbled quotes . The second is a little more subtle , which seems to be a play on his film the Trip , as in the psychedelic-type scenes ( i . e . dancing to Country Joe and the Fish ) with the camera zooming in and out fast , lots of hand-held , etc ) . Corman's gone through this all before , so it has to be questioned : how much of this is tongue in cheek , and how much is just almost shoddy film-making ? Can't be sure . At least there was consistent chuckling to be had , especially at seeing a young Bud Cort in a cowboy hat , and , of all people , Talia Shire !
508487	453068	64782	6.0	actually . . . a lot more fun and watchable than I would've thought , maybe for some wrong reasons	How could one not at least try and watch a big , bulky western yarn where Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood play prospectors who are not only married to the same woman but , yes , sing . Lots of singing . And surrounded by enough extras to give someone a hemorrhage . I did try and watch it , and got through it pretty much unscathed . It's not a movie that one would ever want to put in someone's hands that one trusts and say " yes , this is Clint Eastwood's finest couple of hours " or " Lee Marvin , such a bad-ass " ( albeit for the latter it might be so if talking about his facial hair ) . But digging deeper into the careers of either actor , there are slip-ups that looking at them now actually have a good deal of entertainment value to them . It's just that it's executed - if one were to take this seriously - with such a portend of EPIC ( in caps ) quality , of the production values at a level that would be comparable to the 1995 Waterworld at the time that it becomes too much to comprehend on a human level . Yet there's also the sense of buoyancy to it that makes it kind of admirable as it chugs along . Even in the climax , when the entire town is dragged down thanks to the bull that runs through the tunnel , is cheerful up to a point or at least lighthearted . In fact , there's something kind of charming to a movie that takes its subject matter so not seriously . Like , for example , how hundreds of men all drool at the mouths at the sight of Jean Seberg when she arrives into town , and yet the men decide to hold a sort of auction in order to bid her out ( why not gang up on her ? guess the M rating at the time still carried some provisions as part of the puritanical beats of the ol ' West ) . Or how Marvin and Eastwood both become husbands to Seberg when she just can't decide who she loves more ( and , thanks to the most faithful of all , whiskey , the men reach an agreement on the prospect ) . It's all very ridiculous , from the many , many BIG BIG musical numbers - and I say BIG BIG as they are all loudly produced and with a typical movie studio harmony , only without much choreography organized - down to that hat that Marvin wears as he goes about gathering up more prostitutes for the miners . And what about the songs ? Equally insipid , and if taken as real ' quality ' music is to have to smell your socks for an equal effect . But it's also like a good quality brand of cheese : you take a bite and want a little bit more , and the block is still there for the taking . Songs like " I talk to the trees " and " They call the wind Mariah " , plus anytime Marvin has to sing , is classic stuff on the corniest levels . Oddly enough , Eastwood isn't half-bad as a singer , even with some lift and grace to his voice . Marvin , however , can't sing a note for his life , and the song that apparently won a golden globe or Grammy or whatever has him singing like he's Eeyore the donkey from Winnie the Pooh . When Marvin has to act like a drunken wheez of a prospector who's jealous , greedy , driven by humble melancholy and ego in equal measure , he does alright , and Eastwood , who says more dialog here than in all three of the ' Dollars ' films combined , does what he can . Seberg is also a honey of a starlet , who didn't seem to do much aside from this and Breathless . But as I said , you should go into this knowing what to expect . There was an episode of the Simpsons years ago where Homer looks forward to watching a movie on TV that has Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood , and suddenly he finds that they're singing , a lot . It should be a joke , and it's a hilarious bit of irony really , because it's true . ' What the hell ' will be the first thing to come out of some viewers mouths on finishing the movie , if they get that far . As for me , I just have to smile , crack up laughing a few times , and realize that this is one of the reasons the 70s had to happen .
509011	453068	412637	6.0	a light touch helps from time to time , but it mostly works just enough thanks to the actors	Tom DiCillo is a cool New York-based independent filmmaker , and he's made some good stuff in the past ( most notably as DP for Jim Jarmusch , and as the director of sleepers like the great Living in Oblivion ) , and I wish him the best of luck on anything he does . But on Delirious , he only gets it right some of the time . He's out to , at first it seems , make a satire on media hype and celebrity and the inanities of shallow attention given to people who don't do much to deserve it ( if you need proof of that , watch the Soup on E ! ) . But then it goes a little in a different direction , which I respected and wanted to go along with , as a fable / fairy-tale where Toby ( Michael Pitt ) is just about the nicest , most generous and fish-out-of-dumpster homeless kid who somehow becomes an ' assistant ' to fledgling photographer Les ( Steve Buscemi ) , who shows him the ropes and introduces him to a casting director ( Gina Gershon ) , and eventually - accidentally of course - falls into the company of a pop star ( Alison Lohman ) as the two all but fall in love on first sight . Good premise , and scenes between Buscemi and Pitt most often work the best , and funniest , as one sees subtle layers peeled by Les's pathetic paparazzi who just doesn't admit he's not ambitious enough to not be marginalized as a photographer . There's even some good comedy thrown around , the kind that is that strange , absurdity that we also saw in ' Oblivion ' . But , somehow , it just didn't all click for me after a while . There's a very bitter pill being sent out in , often , very corny and ill-shot scenes ( the latter of which I could accept , but for one brief instant , as Toby walks back to Les's place the morning after he's had that whirlwind night with Lohman , I was shocked at how cheesy a scene it turned into ) . The problem , also , is that it's difficult to mix such a delicate romantic / fable angle while also working in some mockery at the entertainment business . It's all in good amusement to see the " reality serial-killer " show being directed for " realism " , but it all doesn't lead up to anything significant to say past some shallow messages . Maybe I didn't see what others have been ; it's become a minor little hit with most , and I'm sure if you have any desire to see actors like Buscemi and Pitt and Lohman ( who is also very good ) and Gershon ( and hey , there's even a really hip and hilarious cameo from Elvis Costello ) you'll seek it out anyway . However , it's not the best , or least obvious , game in town despite its solid indie cred .
508039	453068	105665	6.0	a fever dream that fans may or may not respond to ; a flawed trip into the world of nightmares	Twin Peaks : Fire Walk With Me is quite the perplexing film as both a David Lynch and Twin Peaks fan , because it's got qualities that should make for one of the best works of the director and doesn't really hit the mark . The problem , in a way , is somewhat comparable to the problem of Dune . There , Lynch's lack of control was something that made it a tough journey to go through , even as there was much to see as pure Lynchian cinema . Yet here with Fire Walk With Me it's almost an overwhelming notion of control that has him going way into a column of intriguing danger where pretension becomes a recognizable factor . It also doesn't help that the end result would benefit from being instead one crammed-in crammed as two . The story of Chester Diamond ( Chris Isaak ) and his disappearance while working on a Twin Peaks-related case has the makings for a much more interesting spin-off , where the universe is still intact that Lynch and company have created but has a whole different trajectory with the characters . Meanwhile , there's the detailed back-story of Laura Palmer's final days , and it's here that Lynch starts to lose his balance . Because Lynch and company made Laura Palmer a much more captivating and deliriously melodramatic force with pure , surrealistic overtones in the past tense on the show , seeing it unfold in present-tense time , with the singularly warped Palmer / Bob / father-daughter dynamic going loses its power . It might not for some ; the bits where one can see why Lynch and Engels went into this excursion in the tale of Palmer are reminiscent of the best that Twin Peaks on TV had to offer ; some of these are the dreams , like the re-appearance of the dwarf with " I am the arm " as a crucial , hilarious scene . But at the same time it almost feels exploitive , as a fan , and for newcomers to TP ( which would be better if you're not in seeing this , unless you're up for a lot of upfront scenes of weird and wild characterization and style ) the revelations feel a little more shallow and sensationalized for content purposes . All your favorite cast members are back , and in Phantom Menance style not really always with as much attention or depth as one could want or feel necessary . But then , was a Twin Peaks prequel necessary to begin with ? This question , which can be a nagging one watching the film at times , has to be put aside for the fact that a prequel now exists and it is what it is . The perception of Fire Walk With Me is tricky because Lynch , Engels and company are not really about getting to deeper truths about the nature of mystery , evil's ongoing pervasive quality , and the subconscious , but in flaunting style ( i . e . the nightclub scene , a likely inspiration for the one in Babel ) as a means of going further and further with the ever-lurid , more HBO-than-Primetime story of Laura's downward spiral . It goes without saying that the line between psychological upheaval and mythology is tested to a degree of fascination as part of the whole creation of the ' Bob ' myth and the Black Lodge themselves . This being said , it's sort of odd and all the same seeing Lynch try to get through a work that is almost too big , too personal , too abstracted , and nearly too easy as too much in a scheme of excess , as he's one of the few American filmmakers today who can create some watchable cinema - occasionally powerful and frightening - as it ironically doesn't work . I'd rather watch Lynch mess something up than a far more deliberate attempt from a Hollywood director . Perhaps a late night viewing sometime may change my mind at some point in the future , as will more contemplation in general about what the darks side of Twin Peaks has to offer as opposed to the more light ( if ' light ' is the word to use ) scenes and well-rounded cast of eccentrics . There's even a noteworthy turn by the film's leading lady , Sheryl Lee , and a wonderfully outrageous dream sequence involving Cooper and some random southern guy played by David Bowie . Nevertheless , FWWM is a slight , disappointing trip , and not up to par with the standard , however high , set by the show as a whole .
510884	453068	161216	6.0	Greenwald is better at documentaries than fiction , but its fairly watchable	Unlike some others who have commented on Steal This Movie on IMDb , I don't know that much about Abbie Hoffman , aside from the obvious that he was a fervent protester in the late 60's , and enough of a symbol of the anti-war and anti-Government movement to get a bit part in Forrest Gump ( he's the " war in Viet-ing-Nam " guy ) . So as part entertainment and part information this film does its job adequately , even as I recognized the film's flaws . It's not without its plus side - if you're a fan of Vincent D'Onofrio ( and to me he has an impressive career as a character actor from Full Metal Jacket to The Cell ) , this is one of the better treats of his career as he lets his hair down ( literally ) and portrays a man on a downward spiral . What's interesting about the story of Hoffman is how he keeps on with the same spirit even as he's forced into hiding in the 70's . D'Onofrio plays the chaotic , but focused , counterculture icon with enough energy and conviction to make up for the fact that it IS a movie-version of the character . As well as this , actors like Janeane Garofalo and Donal Logue are really playing versions of these people that are convincing up to a point . But the problems in the film are more to do with the direction by Robert Greenwald ; he's not as imaginative in treating the material as he thinks he MIGHT be , even as he uses numerous visuals and cutaways in some montage scenes , and adds a typical soundtrack to the proceedings . The script doesn't feel too false in later scenes showing Hoffman's mental breakdown , but it isn't as convincing as I imagine the book ( s ) on and by Hoffman must be . It's a very intriguing subject ( and I'm already a fan of the period ) that's given an adequate cinematic treatment . What's disappointing though for those who come across it will not be what's there but what isn't ; this is the kind of story and character that needs an Oliver Stone kind of treatment ( this is close to it , more like a knock-off ) .
510790	453068	71120	6.0	has the makings of a good remake , though on its own it has its share of flaws	All the Kind Strangers was one of the fifty films that came packaged in a box-set titled " Nightmare Worlds " , and it was one of the rare films that wasn't science-fiction . Yet it probably has just as reason for being in the box-set as sci-fi flicks ; it's got the premise , at the least , and from the description ( wedged in with another movie on the one side of a two-sided disc ) sounds like a cross between the Little Rascals and Deliverance . At least , that would be the first impression had it reached its potential . As it stands , All the Kind Strangers does keep a hold of its creepiness for a while , as Stacy Keach ( playing well as a leading role , which he usually doesn't do ) is a photo-journalist who picks up a little kid carrying a big bag of flour back to his home . Just a normal thing , it seems , to help the little critter out . But then it's a long trek through the backwoods , specifically through a creek , and then to a house where there are seven kids and one " mom " , who really has been sort of kidnapped by the kids . He's kidnapped too , and made to be their dad as their parents are five-years gone . Dogs line the premises , and the pain kid Peter ( John Savage ) carries a shotgun . What to do ? There is actually probably a very good movie , even an extremely controversial one ( maybe on par with Deliverance if not more-so ) with the ingredients here . There's a whole power-structure element in place , the psychological unrest as Peter really is the head of the household - the kids don't know any better , least of all for wacky John ( Robby Benson , maybe the most tongue-in-cheek kid actor of the 70s ) - and how the kids , including Peter , do listen to Keach's ' dad ' if he's forceful enough . And there's even subtext thrown in that is never quite cleared up with a mute girl in the bunch ( obviously , as Frank Miller once wrote , grew up and filled out ) who keeps on eying and making subtle advances towards her new father . This would actually be challenging in better hands , but unfortunately it's A ) a TV movie , and B ) in an odd way meant as a dark twist for the Little Rascals kid's club . So it ends up playing it safe with material that , in the end , becomes preachy and tacky as the kids all decide that it's better to give in instead of having a ready-made mom and dad at the helm . Other things like the cars all drowned in the lake ( and the fact that who-knows how many people have died is left up in the air ) , and little technical things with the production ( i . e . do the kids really pay for the gas , and if not how come there are lights on in the house ? do kids take care of candles that well ? ) Not to mention the length issue ; at 74 minutes the holes are fairly abundant in the plot . But there are strengths here that do come out , even if seeing John Savage might inspire a " I believe in God " bit from Hair , as the acting is more than competent , and given how low the production values are the director gets a good amount of chills from the kids ( awkward might be the way to say it ) and chase scenes . It could make for a remake in good hands , exploring and altering some of the details . As it stands , it's an OK effort with an undercurrent that's sort of unique .
508731	453068	91369	7.0	not as successfully fantastical as the other Henson films , but it is an entertaining KID's flick	Watching Labyrinth on TV the other day , after years of having not seen it , I'm reminded in general how I see Jim Henson's work , via the usual Muppets ( in the ' Muppet ' movies ) or in the non-traditional ones ( the spectacular film ' the Dark Crystal ' ) , just a smidgen different than as a kid . For one thing , there's the nostalgia factor , of having loved the muppets as a kid and seeing how the entertainment value is still there , if on a slightly different wavelength then as a kid - some jokes more received and understood and some moments not as freakish as when back in the day . But with Labyrinth I just thought , despite all of the talent and marvelous special effects , " this hasn't really changed much for me since I was a kid , it's still just , well , good . " The story itself - of young Jennifer Connelly going after her baby brother kidnapped by the Goblin King ( David Bowie , in full-on regalia ) while navigating through the tangential directions of the Labyrinth with help ( or not ) from creatures - is just a fairy tale for kids . That it's got some clever direction from Henson is not without its merits and some scenes get the fantasy feeling right , even for its time and visual FX limitations . But if there are limitations anywhere noticeable it's in the script by Terry Jones , from the story by Henson and Dennis Lin , where chances to reach to a larger audience ( like with the Dark Crystal , which works for adults just as well as for kids ) are missed . The humor in the film does work here and there , but there are also the Bowie songs to contend with which are , more or less , rather disappointing and , well , 80's in retrospect . I still liked the inventive uses with the supporting Muppet-type characters , the little troupe of sorts that follows Connelly's character till the end ( almost ) . However , having seen it again , I'm not sure when I would want to watch it again , unless I had some kids around . In short , one of the lesser Henson films ( ironically the only one produced by George Lucas ) which means that it still has enough visual prowess and imagination to top the current films reaching for its target audience .
509491	453068	462338	7.0	a film about trickery , done in a tricky style that works , with crackling performances	Lasse Halstrom isn't out , as a film-making , to make really extreme and probing insights into what goes into a prankster / forger like Clifford Irving . Maybe it's because he , like I , saw Orson Welles's film F For Fake , which covered similar ground and has the only substantial footage of Clifford Irving on record and in full bloom with his BS meter going sky-high . That film , overall , dug very deep into what is to have forgery , a hoax , as part of personality . Halstrom doesn't quite get that , but nevertheless he's made an entertaining mini-saga of a man - or rather men in this case - who went to the edge of credibility and almost got away with the whole shebang . His story , as covered as well in part in F for Fake , is about Irving's incredibly smart and incredibly stupid attempt at passing off as his own the autobiography of Howard Hughes , then the notoriously reclusive and nutty billionaire with his fingers in enterprises all over the world . He passes off Hughes's handwriting to the publishers and lawyers as his , even as it's really Irving who wrote it all , and even went so far as to have mock audio recordings of Irving AS Hughes to get down in the book via assistant Dick Suskind . As the walls seem to be closing in on their scam , as well as Irving's marriage , it goes as far as mass printings of the book Irving presents - until the ' real ' Hughes makes a press conference call ( call , of course ) , to disprove the book altogether as a hoax . Halstrom surprisingly makes his film light and dark in tone , depending on what stage the story is in , and it's even fun at times to see Irving and Suskind go about their risk-taking maneuvers to get all documents and information they can on Hughes , as if it's guerrilla research . Then as the despair of constant lying increases , and the threat of capture and revelation is nearer , Halstrom makes it more like a paranoid thriller . This latter part may actually be not quite as convincing - so to speak of course , as one can't be sure entirely what's true or not in The Hoax - because , simply , one might not see Irving so much as a crazy person ala Hughes so much as a kind of strange artist-cum-professional at what he does : to make himself believe the BS before he even feeds it to others . Scenes like Irving getting caught by Hughes's " secret agents " in the middle of the night are not as striking as Halstrom might have intended , even as all the while the performances are still good . And the realm of placing the story in context of the times is hit or miss ; it works , to be sure , when going into the Nixon administration sections because it's crucial to the story ( and , according to some articles on the film , is possibly really accurate ) , though putting in the footage of Vietnam and protesters and so forth are sort of padding to environment and period . The music , costumes , locations ( i . e . Las Vegas ) and simple political ramifications make it enough . This being said , The Hoax provides the audience with some very effective performances . Gere , under the right director , can be terrific , and this is one of his best performances in years , as he balances out Irving's higher aspirations of wealth and notoriety with his latter plunge into confusing his own personality with that of Hughes , with suspicions of everything or anyone around him . The filmmakers wisely don't make Irving very sympathetic , and Gere plays this for all it's worth with moments of charm , tension , and delusions of grandeur played out wonderfully . However , if Gere is good , Alfred Molina is better as Suskind , Irving's collaborator and the real behind-the-scenes guy who helps make Irving's fabrications all the more palatable , like hiding documents out of the Pentagon or flying to another country to mail an envelope . Suskind , unlike Irving , ends up dealing with the hoax with more of a psychological / moral burden , and it ends up weighing on his conscience like a brick . It might make Suskind the more conventional character in the movie , but Molina makes him very real and more of the tragic case than Gere's Irving . Molina's track record , at the least , remains untarnished . Other supporting players like Marcia Hay Harden , Julie Delpy , Eli Wallach , and Stanley Tucci are better than average here . The Hoax is a good treat in this month's lot of schlock and big-budget trash by sticking close to making it an actor's movie , and sort of a bittersweet take on what a hoax does in such a grand scale as that of Howard Hughes , and what it does to a person the longer and more intense it goes on for .
510695	453068	101026	7.0	two-thirds of a fantastic dark comedy on the nature of sexual insanity , though not as successful as later Almodovar	It's safe to say that even in a film by Pedro Almodovar that is only marginally successful within the margins there are some good , steamy , questionable times to be had . I can just imagine Pedro sitting in front of his notebook just figuring out ways to mix sex , film-making , kidnapping , and other lewd exercises into some kind of cohesive single film . What makes a very good chunk of Tie Me Up , Tie Me Down exciting satirically is that Almodovar never gives in to making anything TOO serious . Which is perhaps what ends up transitioning the situation Ricky ( Antonio Banderas ) and Marina ( Victoria Abril ) are in from the absurd and flirtingly masochistic to the ( ironically ) conventional and quasi-sweetness that is obviously deep in Almodovar . Perhaps the tying up and re-tying becomes part of a metaphor on the filmmaker's part , that despite it being something very dangerous and totally provocative it's also inviting in ways that would be elusive otherwise . Then again , that the material does ( mostly ) work , by being so disturbing in the bluntness and perpetually deranged mind-set of Ricky , but then in the human connections that are enhanced all the more . If only the motivations - even in such loose and wacky-Almodovar circumstances - were a little more convincing . Nevertheless , I liked a lot about Tie Me Up , Tie Me Down up until it goes off the rails with its logic turning into knots ( simply , I just don't buy that Marina falls for Ricky just like that , even if she was an ex-junkie porn star , and Ricky's advances are like that of a uppity , headstrong but shy 13 year old , a slight reminder of A Life Less Ordinary's bizarrely innocuous kidnapping turned romance ) . Chiefly , the performances and the usually arty-yet-trashy style from Almodovar and his crew . Banderas is , by the way , in one of his best and funniest performances here , a near emblem of the male ideal for a life with a woman , and a with an innocent yet fervent attraction to bondage , with that perfect look in his eyes detailing all even in brief moments . Yet there was something about his stay in the mental home all those years that did something to his ideas towards sex and what it is to live , and Banderas captures this mix of intense sadism crossed with the heart of an old Hollywood-studio leading man who will do anything to brush the leading lady off of her feet . Abril is always believable too , even when Almodovar gives her character a turn around into something more akin to an exploitation film , however sweet it tries to be . While she decides to underplay her immediate fear of her kidnapper , it works to add a level of comic timing to Ricky's own odd-ball ways . They make a great pair , really , especially when it comes to that ' turning point ' , where Almodovar uses his unique style to get five ceiling-mirrored shot of a pivotal scene . There's also a fantastic role of the director of the film Marina is starring in at the start of the film , the aged Maximo Espejo ( Francisco Rabal , who's been in countless films including the Eclipse and Belle de Jour ) , who has the ideas burning and changing around at a beat as to what his ending will be for his actress - death , being saved , something else ? His moments on screen display a richness that lies often in Almodovar's script , where the surreal pressures of shooting the movie for Maximo somewhat carry over - and sort of dissipate as the characters become vulnerable - into that realm where reality and un-reality cross paths . This is heightened , and made a little additionally conventional , by the musical score , which like many of Almodovar's work is a tip of the hat to Herrmann compositions and old Hollywood romantic classics . There's even an emotional upheaval when Ricky and Marina meet again on that balcony overlooking the vista . The wildest thing about the picture is that one does become absorbed in the push and pull relationship between ' kidnapper ' and ' kidnapee ' ( I quote that for its a little redundant to use those terms as the film goes on ) , and that these fed up people are practically the most average couple you'd ever meet . There's sensational comedy stacked in there too , in Ricky's behavior ( moustache ) , the film within the film being shot ( that strongman character is amazing ) , the random TV commercial about Spanish retirees , and just the consistent absurdity in the repetitive , ritual-side of the tying up and down . But there's something missing in Almodovar's third act to live up to the better parts early on , and he chickens out on really making this a much better , more challenging effort . I'll probably watch it someday again though , if only for Banderas and Rabals ' performances .
510221	453068	95385	7.0	a Linklater travelogue where it's about alienation and meandering around ; better on a second viewing	There were moments watching this narrative experiment - the first of many for Richard Linklater - where it comes about as close to being totally mundane as can be possible with the camera . It probably wasn't a problem for him to get his shots , as it looked as if he was making his own personal ' home movie ' with him either on the train or in stations or just bumming around Austin , Texas . In that sense it's almost close to being a documentary even though , according to Linklater , it's not really quite himself on screen even as it is himself . In real life he isn't this mundane and sort of drift-less , however does admit that the feelings are in him , and were in him then , and it's on a second viewing that a sort of pattern emerges from what looks like bare-bones storytelling . Unlike Jarmusch's Permanent Vacation , it doesn't necessarily try to relate some sort of ' character ' in the sense that it's something created by the actor , and then surrounded in the typical indie-movie easy-going scenes . Here , Linklater is showing how such everyday things like traveling on a train , walking through a town , getting stopped by someone to see your t-shirt , watching TV , watching movies , reading , doing laundry , doing dishes , reading a Kafka quote , driving , listening to music , so on and so forth , can have some kind of interest in the initial disinterest in seeing this . On the one hand the narrative is lax , and unlike Slacker there isn't even the framework of a bunch of characters in a small town . But on the other hand out of all of these seemingly random shots of a guy going through the motions in life , dealing without a job , the ' whatever ' attitude of hanging out with friends or a girl , taking care of a car , becomes a narrative itself . It's experimental and as Linklater also has said certainly not for a large audience to see ( and many haven't until the DVD of Slacker was released with this film included ) , but the visual language is rich in its detachment , and at the least is a curious effort that doesn't just keep the audience on a sort of line away from typical emotional involvement but is about the same thing . Far from being any great success , but for a real " student " effort ( self-taught student ) you could get much worse . Watch for a Sterling Hayden tribute in one scene and a sense of dissatisfaction with 80s TV .
508209	453068	478049	7.0	Lennon the peacenik vs Nixon the warmonger paranoid ; a bout that's given good , not great , treatment here	The central premise of The US vs John Lennon ( the latter as described in the Departed , of all movies , semi-sarcastically as " the president before Lincoln " ) is that public figures are always up for grabs if they come out on either side of the fence . Lennon was fervently anti-war - if very unsure about going all the way into the dangerous political zone ( hence not going , wisely enough , to the violent demonstration that happened at the 1972 Republican convention ) - and because of his connection with various people like Jerry Rubin and Abby Hoffmann , as well as questionable ties with the Black Panthers , he was monitored openly , and threatened with deportation for a bogus pot arrest in 1968 . Nixon , meanwhile , was one of the all-time nut-job presidents when it came to the military , who ran in 68 on an " I'll-end-the-war-honorably " ticket and instead kept the war going for years , including invading Cambodia . Many of the facts brought up in this documentary aren't new , especially to those who were alive during the time it happened and the media went all over Lennon ( so it goes in today's tabloids as well , only here it was some kind of real news ) . But they are presented compelling enough so that they can offer up some bits of insights for newer audiences to Lennon's music and politics . To be sure , it is a slanted argument , but slanted for the right reasons ( you're bound to not find anyone in a doc like this saying " oh , Vietnam , not so bad " , unless maybe Liddy ) . Yet the argument holds strong throughout , about the nature of political practice and the ideals of changing things not going well with the establishment . And there are questions raised for the audience , if not directly : should Lennon , who technically wasn't American , be apart of a movement that was going on , or just stuck to doing his songs and music ? ( The filmmakers , by the way , wisely cut out much at all to do with the Beatles , albeit they kind of skirmish past the whole issue of " Beatles bigger than Jesus " when it's presented more as a footnote of the outspoken side of Lennon than connecting to the main focus ) . It's interesting though to see the footage of the " bed-in " , when Lennon and Ono did almost a kind of tour of protest-by-lethargy , and had the press in there as part of the ironic-not-quite-joke of the matter . And there's also fascination in seeing Lennon describe , candidly in archival interviews , the toll the media blitz and upheaval from the government had on him . Only towards the end do the directors start to waver the attention a little bit , even as it is , to be sure , part of the story of Lennon and his eventual tragic death in 1980 . But the core idea behind the documentary is one that will always pose something that the viewer should look for : what is it about two unlikely connected figures - popular celebrity musician-cum-activist and one of the craziest presidents this country ever had - that still seems relevant today ? Can people take away anything from Lennon's struggle with the powers-that-be ? It might be a little obvious ( i . e . getting past apathetic stances and doing nothing to just trying to do ' something ' ) , but the point is made nonetheless in the film , and not in a manner that is too schmaltzy or heavy-handed . Just make sure you don't have a BS drug bust to worry about .
509407	453068	105378	7.0	fun to watch for some of the actors and the ' character ' of the fog , but lesser Woody in my book	I could enjoy Woody Allen's Shadows and Fog without really taking it in as being as superior a work as his other 1992 film , Husbands and Wives . Both are a bit like cinematic experiments , H & W being a very loose and improvisational-feeling take on couples in the style of something like Cassavetes or Bergman , and S & F being an all-out homage to expressionism in Germany , with touches of Kafka , horror and film-noir ( hell , that's all the film is , the latter I mean ) thrown in for good measure . But watching Shadows and Fog becomes a little more tedious as it goes , and a laugh or two and the usual heaping pile of Woody wit doesn't compensate for there being only the ingredients for a story , not a connection of one . We get Woody Allen as Kleinman ( or is it Klienman ) , who gets woken up in the middle of an ultra-foggy night to find a killer , but then finds himself on the other side of the investigation after the murder of a doctor ( Donald Pleasance ) . Meanwhile sexual liaisons go on with John Malkovich and Mia Farrow's characters , just not with one another ( one with Madonna and one with John Cusack ) . All the while scenes go in and out , and Allen is without a doubt very much in love with the period , actually the period put to film , and uses style to its excesses . One example of this is Farrow's visit to a whorehouse , where Allen's camera repeatedly goes around and around in a circular move around the women in profile . There's no real reason to do it just for the sake of having a 360 shot , and this is part of what's good but unfulfilling about the picture . The style is laid as thick as the fog , where motivation is totally lost for the sake of a more ' moving ' change for the characters , like Malkovich and Farrow finding the baby . There's a nice lot of whimsy with magic towards the end too . But seeing Allen in his usual nervous talky mode doesn't match up as well as he thinks it might , or that his intention might have been . It's not spoofing , because there aren't good enough jokes out of the atmosphere . I liked the Kafka side to it , and its all-star cast gets some points for sticking to the material , but it doesn't stir up much thought , or act that memorable in the way that other comedies by the filmmaker work . It's neither boring or dour , yet a trifle compared to Allen's other ' experiment ' that year , which aims for much more within its limits .
507898	453068	113101	7.0	a cool batch of 90's indie pathos	Four Rooms was concocted like one of those many , many collaborative efforts from directors in the 60's and 70's ( i . e . The Witches , Ro . Go . PaG , Boccaccio ' 70 , etc ) , except this would revolve around a bell-hop on New Years Eve . It disqualifies itself as being any kind of masterpiece or classic in independent film-making , and sometimes the filmmakers ( Alison Anders , Robert Rodriguez , and Alexandre Rockwell , and Quentin Tarantino , the last two also serving as executive producer ) look like they're relishing too much in their ( limited ) clout and exuberance to concentrate . As was with many others who viewed the film , I found that the first two segments were the lesser ones , and the last two were the best ones . It all comes down , in this case , to which two were funnier . So , let's break each one down : Allison Anders ' film is a quirky , quasi-lesbian take on a coven of witches , featuring the likes of Madonna and Lily Taylor , are the first to shake up ( perhaps for the better in this one ) Ted the bell-hop . Ted , by the way , is played with a continuous , nervous-type of fervor that goes from being innocuous , to annoying , and then acceptable again . It's also interesting to see how his character goes through different motions when under each director ( for example , in Rodriguez's film he's more of a cartoon-type of character , and in Tarantino's film he hearkens slightly to his previous collaborations with the director , quieter , on edge in a particular way ) . Some of the laughs are surrounded by a kind of attitude put forth by the director that seems a little off . Maybe I'm the wrong audience for it , though - the women in the audience may appreciate it , or rather amused by it , more than I . I give it a B-Alexandre Rockwell's The Wrong Man is my least favorite of the bunch , as Ted gets stuck with a couple of crazed fetishists ( David Proval and Jennifer Beals ) . The problem here lies with two things - the fact that the comedic timing / chemistry is a little iffy / off with the three actors , and that the writing doesn't come off like it's naturally funny . When Beals ' character Angela runs off about Ted's private parts , this could be funny , but it's more ' ho-ho ' than ' ha-ha ' to me . Some of the tension from Roth brings some laughs , but not enough to compensate the uncomfortable atmosphere around the whole segment . I give it a C-The third segment , The Misbehaviors , displays how clever and quick Rodriguez can be with physical comedy ( slapstick ) as well as in getting laughs from kids ( as he did here and there in his Spy Kids movies ) . It is also a boost that the whole segment comes off as though it's like a live-action Looney Tunes short - it's so ridiculous that in some scenes I burst out laughing ( i . e . Ted's reaction to the corpse ) . The set-up with the parents was also amusing in how Banderas and Tamlyn Tomita act towards the kids . Then the pay-off knocks it out of the park . Then we come to the closure , featuring the indie wunderkind at the time , Tarantino , as he takes on two sources of inspiration - Rohald Dahl's " Man from the South " short story , later translated through Alfred Hitchcock's television show . It's a smart , hip little piece of Hollywood satire from Tarantino , as he himself plays an overly obnoxious Hollywood filmmaker , with two guys by his side ( Paul Calderon and Bruce Willis ) , as they take a gamble right after the stroke of midnight . It took me a couple of time to watch this to really get into it , but when I did it was even more promising . The camera-work in the scene ( via ' Dogs ' and ' Pulp ' cinematographer Andrzej Sekula ) is deliberately paced , and it's perfectly leisurely for the pace of the last segment . That much , if not all , of the dialog is funny it's because of the skill and chemistry between the four of them . Plus , a little prologue with Marisa Tomei and Kathy Griffin gives the indication of what insanity is in store . Grade - A . So , is this film a success ? For it's time , I'm not sure . With the power of four million off the success of each director's previous efforts ( Tarantino with ' Dogs ' , Rodriguez with El Mariachi , Anders with Gas , Food , and Lodging , and Rockwell with In the Soup , all from the 92 Sundance place ) , they did whatever they wanted , and it's not the success it could've been . On the other hand , when one looks at the films in perspective , it could've been a lot worse , and it wasn't . At the least , it works as one of the quintessential party movies for fans of the 90's " new-wave " crop .
509933	453068	409182	7.0	it's action and ' what's coming round the bend ' entertainment , nothing more or less	Poseidon is based on a novel , technically , although most will associate it with the original film The Poseidon Adventure from 1972 , unseen by me . What I do know whenever someone mentions it is that Shelley Winters is very memorable in it ( and actually when they refer to her career they bring up that film or Lolita ) . But I knew basically that this was your standard Hollywood-sized blockbuster with a man who could either hit just well enough or miss ( Wolfgang Peterson ) . What he provides by way of being director serves this material more than the lackluster Troy from two years ago . Here he's in his element doing something very elemental , however a lot of the time abandoning logic like the several passengers from the ship . It's popcorn entertainment on a scale that I enjoyed for what it was , while noticing that the investment in the characters was only up to a very small point . Then again , I'm not seeing this film for character development , and the screenwriter Mark Protosevich knows this so he just gives unpretentiously what's needed - the main cast who are all just ' types ' ( i . e . Russell is ex fireman turned mayor , Dreyfuss an architect , Josh Lucas a natural leader , and various female roles of equal strength and shame ) . While I can't completely recommend the film like I would other more successful big-budget ' disaster ' films , I can recommend it perhaps more than others , and unlike the other three big films from this month it doesn't necessarily kid itself too much or go for a way too muddled storyline . And it is actually best to see the film on an IMAX screen ( its effectiveness may actually be lost somewhat once its on TV ) , where the actual first turning point of the ship getting tossed over by the ' rare ' wave is almost worth the price of admission alone for its visual prowess and , indeed , excitement . The rest of the picture is just a series of cliffhangers ( some more literally than others ) , and a lot of running , swimming , ( some ) drowning , and heavy-handed dialog when need be . Peterson is also smart enough here , unlike with Troy , not to overstay the welcome with the material . It's compact enough to be enough of a vehicle of danger and with the technical side all intact , while the characters only get testy up to a point . Some of the early scenes are , of course , too predictable ( even if Dreyfuss's romantic side seems a little displaced and unnecessary ) , as one just wants things go forward with the action . Luckily , on that end , in the tradition of bubble-headed ( pun intended ) thrillers with all the elements of a matinée serial , it's not bad .
510434	453068	118111	7.0	my least favorite of the recent Guest / Levy collaborations , which means it's still funny , sometimes ingenious	Waiting for Guffman wasn't the first Christopher Guest / Eugene Levy collaboration ( as writers I mean , it's a Guest movie all the way ) I had seen , but I think I probably would've reacted to it as I did after having seen it after Best in Show and A Mighty Wind . It's like Guest and his always inspired troupe were with a full burst of energy with their characters , even if they're all in a movie that's a little too short ( it says 84 minutes but it feels even brisker if that's possible ) and provides some characters who are funny all the time ( like Guest's flamboyantly flamboyant Corky or Levy's nerdy and ostensibly Jewish Allan Pearl or Fred Willard as Rob Albertson ) , and some who are funny only in spurts like Catherine O'Hara or Bob Balaban . It's got quirky written all over the place , but it's always endearing in it's very strange way to show these people as they are , and the characters are likable even at their most deranged and just , well , ' small-town ' . Guest plays the director of a small-town's 150th anniversary memorial play , about how a town in Missouri came to be . It's a chance really to get glimpses into the people who get the chance of a lifetime ( err , for seemingly their mundane lifetimes ) , and especially for Corky who gives prima-donna an odd name ; he almost storms off when he doesn't get the money he asks the committee for ( calling them ' bastards ' in an angry burst that's one of the funniest things I've ever seen from Guest in anything he's done ) . Then comes crunch-time for the show , as Corky has to take a part himself and Alan Pearl has to convincingly play a part he has absolutely no confidence at ( those glasses ! ) . And all the while , the ' Guffman ' of the title - ala Godot - is a near God-like figure who could make or break the perception of the production for Corky and his cast . The final revelation from this is a comic classic touch . This all being said , I didn't really get the great big belly laughs and get as sucked into the world of these oddballs ( and all done in improvisational form no less ) as I did with the other films that have the mark of Guest and / or Levy . There are some parts where I'll smile at the near whimsy of what's going on , but a line might go flat or a bit a little weak . But if it's ever on TV , I'm sure I would tune in again just for a little while , if only to see a few of the songs from the 150th anniversary show ( the ' Mars ' song a favorite ) , and for that great epilogue .
510749	453068	87291	7.0	pretty goofy and transparent homage , but it's very good for kids	Frankenweenie is Tim Burton's first live-action short film , shot for Disney in the mid-80s , and has enough imaginations to overpass some overbearing cheesiness at times . It's a sign of things to come for Burton , and the story and some of the side characters remind one of Edward Scissorhands ( no one understands this ' creation ' , and becomes an outcast despite good intentions ) . As a fable it ends on a pretty silly note , almost too much so to take . But it's got a genuine heart to it though , and it's probably a very personal work for Burton aside from being a clever homage . The beginning of the film , for example , showing a movie made by the son with the dog Sparky , seems like it's taken autobiographically from Burton's life as a kid . The story , just in the cover art on the VHS tape ( the original one , albeit a cut version ) , tells all about what needs to be known . What is then remarkable , and what makes it a lively and funny trip of a quickie for kids , is how visually creative it is . The shots taken from Frankenweenie's POV are downright charming , and the physical reactions from the neighbors to the new and improved dog almost makes the film worth seeing just for those parts . The lead boy , played by Barret Oliver , is actually quite bland for the lead and doesn't do much except sulk , or act quasi-happy , and not very well either . But his work doesn't matter in the end as much as the side characters , or the parents ( Duvall and Stern ) who are good enough for what it's worth . In the end , Frankenweenie is kind of like an expensive student short film , where a style is emerging but not fully formed , and at the same time there's real entertainment to be had . As a kid , more so than now , I watched it with more enthusiasm , but years later it's still a fun ride .
510650	453068	95989	7.0	" Cut it ! Cut it ! Cut it ! Save the film , strike the broad and kill the babies . "	It's funny , sort of , that Return of the Killer Tomatoes actually lives up to ( err , goes to the depths of ) the original parody of schlock horror Z-grade movies it's coming from . It knows what it is in its bones , and still has a hell of a lot of fun getting to where it's going - which is almost nothing . I couldn't help but laugh through much of the flick though , especially after having seen the first one . After starting off the picture ( and reminding me for a moment of Python's Holy Grail ) with a whole other picture ( unintentionally ? ) with girls taking off their tops on a beach , we get right into it full-throttle . John Astin , usually a very professional theater actor , plays Professor Gangreen in the other wild over-the-top horror comedy of 1988 ( the other is Don Calfa in Chopper Chicks in Zombietown ) , and he's got a plan - create killer tomatoes again , but this time not REALLY tomatoes , but just regular tomatoes that can turn into killing machines Rambo style ! But the professor also makes a woman ( sexy Kara Mistal ) for himself , and she strays away with her little fuzzy tomato , or FT , and meets Anthony Stark's Chad , a worker in a tomato-sauce-less pizza parlor with his friend Matt ( George Clooney , yes , half a decade before ER if you can think back to them ) . Things then start to get a little wacky . . . Well , actually , wacky is such a little word to use . Return of the Killer Tomatoes , a movie that does not feature one real killing tomato ( though potential quasi-killers they may be , and once in a while suicidal ) , is by and large one of the funniest horror-movie parody type sequels of the 80s . It takes itself about as seriously as you might expect , which is not at all . In fact the tongue is so placed firmly in cheek , it comes out the other end during scenes when writer / director John DiBello breaks the ' fourth wall ' as the shooting of the movie ( and massive , continuous , " elaborate " product placements are put in at every turn after a while , years before the gag was used in Wayne's World ) . I probably had bigger laughs during moments like these - with some random outbursts of ninjas fighting cowboys in a diner - than I did during the first Killer Tomatoes flick . While the original still does garner points for being as audacious with its stupidity and with a smaller budget ( not that the sequel doesn't make fun of the budget at every other turn ) , the zany spirit of the first film remains strong here , and deliriously so at times . When you got the doctor's assistant of Igor looking like a wrestler , you get the idea . It's a wild and crazy ride , with a 20-something Clooney with a full head of dark hair and basically in a role that requires him just to act as himself to a much more condensed range ( i . e . ladies man , which includes a great gag involving him getting girls to go on a date with him , though saying as if he's Rob Lowe ) . Its got plenty of stuff for fans of the first flick , including the Ewok of the series with FT , who has his own sort of merchandising going towards the end too . By the way , stay through till the end of the credits - it's not just because the director's mother said so !
510062	453068	416449	7.0	one of the most elaborate , yet shallow exercises in 21st century epic style you'll see this year	300 comes way of Frank Miller , the ultra-famed comic book artist and author ( behind the neo-noir Sin City ) , and Zack Snyder , who brought us the remake of Dawn of the Dead ( not a shame nor not a necessity from the original ) , and it's what movie audiences probably salivate for when it comes to action epics from a time period dozens of centuries ago . But because it's Frank Miller , and he's never one to skimp on being garish , gory and a tad shallow with his take on certain topics , be they 40s pulp-fiction clichés or Batman or a Spartan battle like here , it's the farthest thing from naturalism . Snyder knows this , and decides to go for broke , albeit extremely faithful to the source material ( and I say this having not read this graphic novel but having read other Miller works ) , and it becomes another case of a comic-book getting pumped up like some kind of wild cinematic toy , in this case probably with steroids . But to say that it pretty much becomes style over substance would be too easy , because the problems that come up in the film are not just in the substance , but also in what starts to hit the viewer over the head . Not that there aren't a good many memorable , bloody and exciting images that could only come from the fed up mind of Miller , but there is still the all-too basic qualities to the substance too . I know I shouldn't make too much of an issue with something like substance in a film that supposes right away what its audience is : men , more than women ( although I wouldn't count them out as fans entirely ) into seeing men be MEN , warriors out for the kind of glory that comes with legends . The basic legend for the battle of 300 is that there were about 300 Spartans , led by Leonidas ( Gerald Butler ) , who was the ambitious king who decided to take on the king of Persia , who claimed to be a God , instead of submitting Sparta to the rule of the Persian empire , and with it going through extremely brawny moves to not stop till the last Spartan laid to rest . More or less that , anyway , as Miller throws in certain , or make that extreme , ' peculiarities ' with both sides . The Spartans , for example , consult an oracle , who is some girl that contorts around like she's in an emo music video , and there's a deformed hunchback-outcast , who turns on the Spartans and tries to bandwagon with the mega-pierced , sexual-maniacal ' heathens ' that are seen as the Persians . The Persians , by the way , may not have the greatest / most blood-thirsty of warriors , but they do have ninjas with masks , and a rhino , a deformed-barbaric homunculus , and a few " clumsy " elephants . Plus , that king / God , who's ultimate shame is that he's proved by his own people to not be a God , I guess , by Leonidas's last throw of a spear . So , as one might gather , there is a lot of ' things ' going on in 300 , though as far as stuff with historical pertinence , not so much . There's a fairly predictable and straightforward sub-plot with Leonidas's wife ( Lena Heady ) back in Sparta having to put up with a traitor in her midsts , though one she succumbs to partially . But for the most part , we're submerged into characters who redefine what it means to be ' one-dimensional ' , and while the acting is never actually all that bad , even from the usually barking Butler , the words Miller gives them don't do much to make it sound anything more than , well , a comic-book . Which is OK in bits and pieces , until the feeling of being practically detached from reality wears thin , including getting inundated with narration , lifted by Snyder likely from all those narration boxes one sees all the time ( and somehow seemed to work better in Sin City ) and during some of the BIGGEST dramatic action sequences . It may sound like the substance is a bit too much to bear and that I , as part of the audience , took it all too seriously . This is not exactly the case , really , as the storytelling in and of itself is fairly strong and worthwhile to tell - it's just that not taking it seriously makes it enjoyable in the shallowest ways possible . This is sort of amped up to 11 by how Snyder puts all of this together technically . It's another stepping stone for the world of combining CGI and live-action , where blood and body parts and heads roll off in a disgustingly enthralling way , and where environments are almost TOO dark & / or lush . There are actually very great images as well , unexpected ones , like when we see some of these walking abstractions of violence and mayhem from the Persians , or some kind of goat-man during the Persian's strange orgy scene . Even the battle scenes , sometimes , are worthy of the best parts of Braveheart and Gladiator . Yet sometimes there is too much , as with the narration , of pushing the boundaries with the style - slow-motion , for example , gets about of the attention for all of the battle & / or anything remotely action related in the film , and Snyder's tactic with his DP and editor is to speed up for a moment , then slow down , speed up , slow down , over and over during a battle scene . It comes very close to completely abusing the usage of 32fps in action , for no good reason no less . All this aside , I'm still glad I saw 300 , at least the one time on a gigantic IMAX screen where the contorted camera angles , machismo-rousing moments , and the epic sweep of a production done in such a weird way made it a fun , gory trip . And yet , it doesn't inspire to go back to it more than once , and its pleasures , however in a guilty way ( I couldn't help but getting a kick out of the dead-pan manner of some shots and exchanges between the characters ) , are brief and not very lasting .
509708	453068	74650	7.0	obviously repetitive , but it has its moments , primarily as an act of rhythmic poetry	They talk so fast that you need ears like a super-hawk to really decipher what they're getting at , but it's this speed at going about selling goods that interest Werner Herzog so much . He's said in interviews that it's almost like " the poetry of capitalism " , as these high-stakes auctioneers , selling off cattle within a matter of seconds , are in a unique little world unto themselves and their small audience , mostly full of small town yokels and Amish . This doesn't make his documentary on them particularly exceptional , however , as it's a little too long and a little much without a lot of human interest ; we don't know who most of these ultra-fast talkers are . It is , however , quite funny at times to see them go this fast , perhaps in a sort of detached way ( then again , how can one who's never been to a cattle auction know anything about what it's like to see mouths go at a mile a minute ) . It's great to see when he's interviewing one guy and he starts explaining how he auctions , and at first in regular speed soon as a sort of reflex goes off into his ultra-fast speaking voice . I also liked getting into the groove of the competition , as it were , seeing how despite it being still at lighting speed with numbers and calls it can be understood which ones are the slower ones . Although Herzog fares a lot better using the auctioneer in his fiction film Stroszek - Scott McKain is the one featured in the scene where Stroszek's items are sold off in an immediacy that is purely staggering and , as it's so unexpected following the pace of that film , is one of the most hilarious scenes of the 70s in cinema - it's a fine little portrait of a group that is somewhat representative of the fun that's missing in more run of the mill acts of commerce . You're not going to see this kind of auction at an art gallery in midtown New York , only in a Herzog film .
508776	453068	82601	7.0	a more than decent soap-opera with bits of uproarious ' making-movie ' comedy	Fall Guy is advertised on the front of the recently released DVD as " a comedy from the director of Battle Royale " . That last part is true , but it's not entirely a comedy . I was expecting that , and in the first fifteen minutes it is that , incredibly and with total personality-laden hilarity as a Japanese movie star , Ginshiro ( Morio Kazama ) is a prototypical ego-maniac who is furious that there's stalling on building a gigantic staircase for an action sequence and then proceeds to get drunk and complain about not having enough screaming fans . Up to this point it is a comedy . . . and then it suddenly starts to unfold deeper , and we meet the characters Konatsu ( Keiko Matsuzaka ) , Ginshiro's presumed love interest and father of her unborn child , and Yasu ( Mitsuru Kirata ) , a close friend and would-be low-level stuntman who may be the father of Konatsu's baby by " default " , and it becomes a soap opera . To say soap opera isn't really to decry it , as one might imagine ' soap opera ' to be something already to be wary of . It isn't quite melodrama , though it edges it in some fiery scenes ( my favorite was an explosive bit where Yasu rebels from this existential conundrum of doing a non-death-proof stunt down the stairs ) , and a lot of it surrounds taking care of an unborn baby , marrying someone who might not be the right one and a shady ex-lover who is obsessed with his scenes being cut from the current martial arts movie . So it's all stuff you could possibly catch on daytime TV . The difference is , thankfully , director Fukasaku casts his actors based on impressive personality , on lots of intense emotional power , and he interweaves the personal love story with an absorbing look at the making of Japanese martial arts movies ; just watching Yasu in the montage of doing various stunts for 5 to 10 thousand Yen is funny but also a small love letter for the movies . It's also topped off , I should add , with a climax that has been building for about half of the movie and pays off , incredibly , and is in a way a better climax than some of the rest of the movie deserves . In a way a director like Fukasaku , a seasoned veteran probably not too unlike the director character in the film directing the film within Fall Guy , is needed to imbue the screenplay with real dramatic force and a sense of how to slip in those wonderful bits of comedy . At the least , if you love Japanese cinema , it's worth watching once . At best , it's fun romantic pulp .
508495	453068	74829	7.0	somehow straddles the line between being legitimately good and just bad-good Italian sex-horror flick	I don't know how I could explain that I like Werewolf Woman . It doesn't work logically as a movie , but does one go into a movie that's about a schizo who craves the company of men and then kills them at the instant they try and have their way with her expecting great art ? It's a little like a rougher , more sexed-up cut of Cronenberg's Rabies , only here the dead or injured don't come back to life . This time it's Annik Borel , instead of Marilyn Chambers , as the perplexed anti-heroine of the story . The catch with her is that she has werewolf ancestry in her blood , and after a cruel rape ( which we may or may not see on screen , I can't remember ) she goes on a killing spree . The dubbing is bad , but maybe deliberately so ; Leone didn't have dialog so bad that it made the voice-over actors cringe as they said some of their lines . And sometimes the director and crew get creative with blood and various colors : there's a shot when Daniella , after attacking a nurse whom she's snuck into the car with , gets out of the now crashed vehicle , and the first shot seen looks as though there's blood everywhere , though it's mostly just the seats and a jacket . For a moment or two , Werewolf Woman carries artistry ( not to mention during a particularly steamy sex scene as Daniella watches with hungry , jealous eyes of a friend getting it on with a friend ) . When all is said and done , Werewolf Woman does teeter between a hot and exciting half-farce half-serious / pretentious drama on a woman's descent into madness and murder , and it doesn't amount to any kind of ' statement ' except that , um , crazy women with a disease passed down through the generations can't be stomped out so all men with penises have to pay . Yeah , that's it . But even with the laughs that are had - including a bit when Daniella is in the hospital bed and an over-affectionate nymph comes in trying to have her way with the taut were-woman that probably inspired the P Wagon scene in Kill Bill 1 - it's not a badly made film at all , which adds to the appeal . It's not some stupid movie put together in very cheap soft-core ways . If there is any strength to the best sex scenes it's that they seem actually erotic and not as some tedious pornographic exercise ala Porno Holocaust . And , relative to other cheesy horror flicks of the 70s ( the Italian horror 70s ) , Annik Borel isn't too shabby an actress , with a quality reminiscent of Sondra Locke from Clint Eastwood's films ( only , perhaps , a better actress ! ) She adds just that little bit of fun and danger to a part that needs it to sustain its tone wavering between exploitation and sincere horror . So watch it under a full-moon , make sure you're tied to the bed ( without any crazies around to untie the knots ) , and keep all sexual organs on stand-by - Werewolf Woman is a bite !
508705	453068	486585	7.0	not quite long enough to really dig into it all , but as a term-paper-type look , it's not bad , and even funny	How do I talk about a film where I can't even mention its title in this review ( in the IMDb comments the word of the title of this film cannot be put in , unless in the form of fck or sht ) ? I can talk mostly then about how the filmmakers go around the use of the word fck . Fck is the word that gets everyone's ear up , and depending on the context or meaning behind it can get some people riled up enough to do something about it - like reporting to the FCC on violations if done on TV or radio . The hypocrisies and oddities are of course on display , like with the now legendary George Carlin ' Dirty Words ' case where the one and only person to report that the segment played on the radio was wrong was on the Decency board in the 70s . Or , of course , Lenny Bruce , who also had a fight that he ended up losing miserably , however much he paved the way for everyone else in his field . There's also a good segment done on the f word in politics and religion , even in poetry ( I'll have to look through Ulysses now to see where it's at ) . But even with the laughs that are obvious to come with such a given for scandalous material , including various movie clips featuring said word ( Pulp Fiction , Punch-Drunk Love , South Park , Scarface ) , and even with the Presidential utterances and sound-bytes of the word ( Nixon's the most obvious yet still unnerving ) , and even with some of the interviewees really giving some food for fing thought on the subject ( Billy Connolly is arguably the funniest , with HST being low-key and observant , and Allen Keyes and Pat Boone delivering very straight-laced answers ) with the two-side arguments , there doesn't seem quite enough here to be totally satisfying . In fact , the structure , however hokey and joyful in its wicked little ways , has to start delivering on more interesting grounds . Maybe it's just me , but by around the 100th time one's heard the word in such a span of several minutes , the word has already lost all of its power ( albeit given context by a scene of coitus on a music stage , a very controversial story at the time , among others ) , and there should be even more dirt available , aside from the usual historical asides . For example , I would've liked to have seen more on the F-word in music ( where's the MC5 when you need em ? ) , or the section of children , which should be a topic that could at least cover a lot more of the film , especially since the filmmakers obviously want to leave it as something of a climax . . . so to speak . Yet , if you want a successfully shallow , goofy take on the subject that might raise some eyebrows and just be another night watching a DVD for others ( who knows if the record setting 800 times is just another night at the bar for some guys ) , it's worth the rental . I'm glad the filmmakers took the equal-time interviews for those who are in it all-not that it occasionally preaches to the choir - and that the bases covered are given enough coverage to get a full understanding of how such an infamous word can become even more so in the 21st century , under a government that has raised the ante on the conservative agenda within the free speech guidelines , and that the censorship ends up spreading to other areas as well . Bleep , I say .
509341	453068	60304	7.0	If you can't afford LSD , try colour TV .	It's strange to see a work by a filmmaker that is a lesser one , but made during his prime . It's like watching a Godard that speaks to his future films - the much lesser ones - while still holding onto the quality of his work at the time . It came after Masculin / Feminine , a very good work , made during Made in USA ( unseen by me ) and before Week End , possibly Godard's quintessential attack / satire on culture and film-making . With 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her , we get a character who you might think at first is like the Anna Karina character in My Life to Live . She seems to sell herself for sex , but also just lives her life the way she wants it to . But it's really sort of three different strands going on concurrently - there's a pretty coherent look at a mother and wife , Juliette ( Marina Vlady , often as dead-pan as Godard can get her to be ) , who sometimes takes cares of her kids , sometimes just goes out to shop and socialize , and sometimes has absolutely passionless sex for money . The second strand almost comes as being like a pseudo-documentary - or a satire on one perhaps - where Godard has his ladies , Juliette and several others throughout , who break the ' 4th wall ' and talk right to the camera about their own state of mind and being and such . The third strand has Godard himself , in a perpetual whispering tone ( to get our attention , of course ) about the usual socio - political - philosophical - moral - cinematic - why - is - the - sky - blue narration that accompanies many a Godard film . And all of this , of course , with some of the most breathtaking cinematography I've seen in any of his work - there are close-ups that , as repetitious as they might've been , really did work . Like with the coffee - we see the coffee and the bubbles , and the colors swirling , while the narration keeps on going . There's even a very self-conscious moment where the camera blurs , the narration mentions blurred perspective , then when things come into ' focus ' on both ends . In fact , this is not only one of the most self-conscious of all of Godard's work , but one of the most self-conscious films I might have ever seen . Not that this is an immediate negative , and in this framework Godard's intentions , aside from giving a good kick in the nuts to conventions and what the usual even means in typical words and descriptions of ' things ' much less with cinema . There's almost a sense of consciousness expansion he's after in this self-consciousness too , which is par for the course for a Godard film . And it's also loaded to the gills with bright primary colors ( this was continued into Week End , though with that in much greater , striking effect ) , and product placements galore ; it always gives one a grin to see his great love / hate relationship with items from mass marketing and produce . And , of course , those title cards . But what ends up lacking from the film for me , and why I would only consider it a good Godard film as opposed to a masterpiece , is that I get a lot more fulfillment watching Godard's work when he just loses all abandon of common plot-sense , and just makes almost an video essay with plenty of semantics , a loose story , and an eye for locations and people and scenery and products and all sorts of things that show him being instinctively good with the camera . . . BUT , that it's also entertaining . It's not that 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her isn't never quite interesting , but the fulfillment I got out of it was more of being so familiar with his work that I could get a kick out of things I could already expect in the changes of form and moments of contemplative narration , not really out of any emotional connection though to anything with anyone in the film . Juliette , unlike Karina's Nana ( who , by the way , as a tongue-in-cheek in-joke appears in a pop-art style photo on a wall in one scene right from that movie ) , is at least 70 % of the time not really a character in the usual sense : if anything she's more of a mouthpiece , a kind of figure for Godard to put forward his ideas of feminist / radical thinking , done in a manner of voice and inflection that is always the same , rarely shifting . Maybe that's part of the point , and by the end we may know more than two or three things - especially about what she's thinking and attitudes on gender and the whys and why nots of just living and existence - but emotions are almost null & void in this world . In the meantime , as Godard maybe knows he doesn't have enough of a story with her ' real ' character , when not talking to the camera , as a wife and mother , he shifts attention at times to random moments with other women , like one who talks to the camera about her banal existence ( " I walk , climb , see a movie twice a month , etc " ) , or with a sort of touchy sexual discussion in a bar . The focus actually is never too grounded for Godard , which is partly what I mean about this film hinting at the descent his films would go to in the 80s and 90s ( at least from my point of view ) . It's not JUST about women , it's almost about everything - drugs , culture , TV , politics , war ( Vietnam especially , quite the topical philanthropic satirist he was ) , automobiles ( a funny bit happens with a red car too ) , literature , morality , and all that and a bag of 60's-era Godard chips . It's worth checking out , I suppose , especially in widescreen , but not as something to see right away if getting into the director's work - I think if I had seen this as my third or fourth Godard film I might've disliked it even more . As apart of a stretch of films , I respect it and am involved , but compared to the others it's not as successful in terms of it really connecting more than it does .
509536	453068	362227	7.0	a good piece of humanist comedy , nothing more , nothing less	The Terminal is sort of like a a Frank Capra tale spun into 21st century America , with it a sort of divide between the naive innocence of ordinary men , and the cynicism of the outside world . It also is akin to E . T . as being about an outsider who comes into a strange situation , gets befriended , but in reality is really all on his own on his quest . There is a sweetness to the film that works well , even when all plausibility at times goes right out the window in return to try and make shamelessly entertaining product . Steven Spielberg here has a film that is meant , in a way , as THE film for airline movies , as it can be geared for kids and adults , though like airplanes its not always the best experience . Tom Hanks is genuine for a lot of the performance , and at least a little fascinating , as Viktor Navorski , a refugee from a country made up for the sake of the film ( though , apparently , his accent is for real ) . He's stuck in the airport , not able to leave into New York City or back to war-torn home . So , he sticks around , he meets the janitor , he runs into a emotionally weary flight attendant ( Catherine Zeta-Jones , not the best she's done but cute enough ) , and gets to become familiar company around the huge terminal . It's a huge place , with adversiting that almost makes it like a insular Times Square . During this Viktor goes from befriending the workers , to befriending the attendant , which leads to some romantic interest - or maybe not . Who knows with Viktor's true intentions to stick around for his chance to get into New York City . The reason he ends up telling is , actually , one of the most touching moments in the film , maybe even in the better of Spielberg films . This isn't , however , overall anything great in the filmmaker's cannon . Maybe not a ' minor ' work , but it's often with too much whimsey . Or maybe not ; it is a film that is meant as a crowd-pleaser , or a heartwarmer , but at times isn't too sure how to balance between some of the believability the script needs at times ( i . e . why is the focus sometimes squarely on Navorski , when its a security station meant to focus on everyone at the airport ) . The visual styling is impressive , with some cool camera sweeps and tracks in the immense set . But it doesn't add up to anything that marks it as a great film . It also doesn't hold up as well as Spielberg's other films on repeat viewings ; on a first go-around it is sheerly entertainment , but once seen again certain scenes bring out some groans . It might be even more enlightening or fun for kids , as it is on that sort of E . T . level . And Hanks ' performance , which only shows some dimension towards the last twenty minutes , is good enough , though could've been more . I guess in short I'm saying that the Terminal is reccomendable , especially as a ' date ' movie of sorts , though I wouldn't say to start off with it as the first Spielberg ever . That being said , Kumar Palau ( the janitor character , also a Wes Anderson regular ) , is the best thing about the movie .
510050	453068	296774	7.0	good look at some semi-obscure and well-known Hardcore-punk acts , but not the definitive one	Frank Pavich has directed a fairly absorbing document on what is , in small part , the New York Hardcore scene . It was around and in NYC , as well as parts of New Jersey , that Hardcore ( as we learn here a mix of Metal and Hip-Hop ) is a " way of life " that also by nature includes punk to a certain extended extent . While I would probably recommend pictures that include more ' true ' music and wider perspective like American Hardcore , or just plain better craftsmanship like Decline of Western Civilization , it's certainly not a waste for the people looking for something new ( or rather semi-new , it just got released on 10th anniversary DVD ) and a couple of acts that might seem either obscure or just strange . Bands like Madball are not unknown to me , and I might have even watched or listened to them in the past ( I'm not a huge hardcore fan so most bands in this film are new to me - sometimes , frankly , perhaps for the better ) . It's a fascinating mix of ridiculously tattooed lead singers , black guitarists who have real ' street cred ' that has probably left them scarred , and even a Hare Krishna who thinks Hardcore will soon open up more doors for Christian ideology ( ! ) The actual musical performances range depending on your taste in hardcore : we got one vocal out of a bear cave , another that is quick and energetic , another remorse and more in line with a Staind group , or with just plain attitude to burn . More often than not the interviews give more to offer than the actual bits of music on stage , which is probably a disappointment , but for all its minor faults its still a small time-capsule type of window into what was remaining of that dedicated Hardcore scene in NYC following its big explosion in the early 80s ( we mostly hear from Roger Merit's little brother as opposed to actual Agnostic Front themselves ) .
510448	453068	478338	7.0	captivating as a subject , so-so as documentary	I got introduced to Slavoj Zizek through his under-seen Lacan-style analysis of cinema called the Pervert's Guide to Cinema , and was immediately taken in by his very sharp mind , oddball sense of humor , and dead-on analysis of the nature of cinema and the Freudian psychology . This little documentary by first-time director Astra Taylor basically follows Zizek around , usually without much control visually ( her main tactic is to get her in close-up , which isn't smart since he's always animated , if still controlled ) , but always obtaining what Zizek is all about . He gets a person's mind moving about so many subjects : the super-ego and it's ties to capitalism , the need to associate oneself with ideology and the dangers with that , how to use philosophical ideas meaningfully , and what belief plays a role in politics and psychological interpretations . Not limited to these topics are all on Zizek's mind , and all of his points reveal him as a man with unlimited intelligence , even as his mind goes so fast it becomes something of a task to keep up with him . Little moments Taylor captures add idiosyncrasies one might not expect from someone as such a Marxist and Lacan-follower ( however NOT a Dogmatic Lacan-follower as he says ) , including showing off his son's toys , and shopping for movies at Kim's Video in New York City , or how he tries to look for a restaurant . But for the most part , Zizek ! at it's best - and it's best to look at for its substance , not its style - brings to mind the nature of philosophy for the individual , how politics ends up feeding into the public's consciousness by way of wanting more " enjoyment " , or what enjoyment really means . It's almost TOO short , and one who becomes fascinated by Zizek's theories and very straightforward interpretations of subjects that should be more complicated by how he describes them sees that sometimes he gets cut off from what is such a long and amazing description or drawn-out thought . But if one is interested already in the man , it should provide some fun and food-for-thought seeing the man in down-to-earth form for the cameras , and newcomers may or may not take to the man's theories . Like Pervert's Guide , some things will fly over your head , but what sticks makes for some of the most insightful commentary in recent years .
508641	453068	48545	7.0	not my favorite Nick Ray film by far , but it's worth viewing as a " essential " from the 50s	I put quotations around the words " essential " in that one line because , really , I'm not totally sure what essential means really when it comes to seeing films from that decade . The general consensus - on which one might dub a film like Rebel Without a Cause overrated - is that this film is THE film on teenage angst and dislocation from the adults of the period , and that it's essential because of James Dean , or that it might be considered director Nicholas Ray's best film . For me though , " essential " is a very subjective term , and one person's essential being this film is another one's essential being Bigger Than Life or In a Lonely Place , films that get some notice in the film circles but not enough when placed against a film like the one here . It's the kind of picture I end up recommending , but not exactly under the terminology of how I would find it to be essential or not , because I don't really . It's not a sort of seminal , staggeringly entertaining and artistically satisfying work about being an outsider in the 50s like On the Waterfront or even one most people wouldn't think of like Ikiru . From a historical perspective , however , and for the significance of James Dean , it is worth a viewing , at least once , if you want to know at least what the industry leaned towards in the 50s . Now , on to the actual film - it's the story of Jim Stark , who is disaffected and with a sort of glow about him ( if glow is the word , maybe just , um , malaise ) , and its more of a reflection on his parents ( Jim Backus , who is actually quite good here , and Ann Doran as his mother ) than on society as a whole . Not that society doesn't have a part in Jim's emotional downward spiral . He's a kid who ends up getting connected to violence ( ' Don't call me chicken ' is coined famously , and maybe unintentionally amusingly , by Dean in this film ) , and all the while Dean plays him very calmly and coolly , with his big emotional bursts strong and piercing . But as I've yet to see his other two big cinematic roles in East of Eden or Giant , I can't compare one to the other or not . On its own , his turn today almost borders on being too melodramatic , even too stuck in the period ( Brando , as mentioned before , had the ' normalcy of detachment and cool ' down to a T unlike Dean here who is good if not great ) . He's followed along by compelling supporting work by Sal Mineo and Natalie Wood , as equally disaffected youth , but in different ways that end up clinging the three of them together . The story , as much as it tries to , isn't really as convincing as it tries to be , and unfortunately to me doesn't hold up like it should . The convincing bits are still there , and some scenes are revelatory into the little things about teenagers , like the trip inside the planetarium - no matter how tough they think they are or act or anything , they can still be amazed by some things , the unknown that is . And the fight that happens after-wards - along with the ' chickie ' drag race at night that leads to a tragic turn of events - are classic Ray-directed moments . But the classically trained style of film-making by Ray , with the level of subversion still there under the surface of the immediate context , isn't as fulfilling when given to the story and characters and acting . Some characters are just outright silly or so one-dimensional that you can't believe someone like Dean's character would have to deal with them at all . Even an emotionally complex scene like the " it's tearing me apart " speech doesn't hit quite as hard as it might have in 1955 . By the end of it all , I knew Rebel Without a Cause was worth viewing , but as an immediate masterwork of the Hollywood system ? I'm not really sure on that , and certainly not if one's talking about essentials from the director .
508724	453068	430922	7.0	a bleepin ' funny movie . . . the kind that might make you say bleep a lot , or join LAIR	There's a joy to watching smart writing with totally tasteless dialog , and Role Models fulfills that joy even while staying fairly predictable with most recent comedies . Anybody familiar with the " Apatow formula " ( in quotes since there isn't really one unless you've not watched many comedies ever ) knows the shlubs or outsider characters put into an extraordinary ( or untenable or just strange ) set of circumstances , there's some bonding or growing closer romantically or just emotionally , the third-act kicks off with a conflict that is understandable but all connected with the plot mechanics , and everything ends pretty close to a purity of ' tidy ' . Luckily , the director , David Wain , has his own way of doing things , not too dissimilar to Apatow's bunch , which is to fill in these plot points with fantastic comic actors and enough improvisation to impress the Upright Citizens convention . So , in short , the movie is very funny , sometimes so much so that you'll laugh for several seconds just about what you just laughed at ( the Marvin Hamlisch line in this instance was one of those , plus anything having to do with KISS ) , and features Paul Rudd in another good disaffected-character turn and Seann William Scott's funniest in so long as I can remember . The premise , which is slightly thin but fine nevertheless , is that Rudd and Scott play kind-of friends working for an energy drink company ( the truck itself is a larf aimed at the Minotaur ) and after a particularly bad day Rudd drives the truck through a horse statue and the two of them get sent to community service looking after awkward / deviant children . Then , as want to happen , they bond with the kids ( one a curse-a-second black kid and a young teen dork with his obsession being LAIRE role-playing ala D & D ) and one or two lessons are learned on love and friendship and so on . This premise could work with just Rudd and Scott , who are capable actors , but the minor genius here is to surround themselves with funnier or just go-for-broke people . Jane Lynch , for example , not only steals every scene she's in but threatens to steal the entire movie as the ex-coke head manager of the ' Wings ' center for the kids , as she has replaced all of her drugs and " BS " for , well , the children . On top of this is also Superbad's McLovin ( Mintz-Plasse ) as Auggie , the role-playing nerd who brings out the best ( or just the un-tapped de-cynical ) in Rudd , and the newcomer ( Thompson ) who plays the young kid with the libido of a 20 year old ( or would-be libido ) and the mouth of a two-ton sailor . For the latter , he almost becomes a little wearisome with a kind of " shtick " of the kid saying ( insert f bomb or crazy insult ) every few seconds - and yet , this , as with the LAIRE fighting and the gratuitous sex stuff ( there's an Ambien joke that kind of rocks , plus a quick one-liner about a child sex-trade that's a bleeping winner , scuse the language ) , doesn't get too irksome of corny or whatever . If you need to watch a dirty comedy with kids and crazy nerd stuff and fake medieval fighting and another good Paul Rudd performance - ye turn here .
509044	453068	66214	8.0	rock stars , gangsters , sex , drugs , suits , blood , psychedelia - all in a day's work	To say Performance is " dated " is about on the mark , if not understating it . It's a psychedelic trip into the two bellies of the underworld : organized crime ( not the Italian kind , more-so the rough Anglo-Saxon father of the likes in Guy Ritchie's movies ) and the swinging , rock ' n ' roll drug-addled bunch that first saw proper cinematic light in Blowup . But somehow Douglas Cammell and Nicholas Roeg pull off what should be just weird poppycock as only derelicts from Andy Warhol and Tim Leary's bunch could concoct into a piece of half pop art and half just , I don't know what . Roeg , I think , hovers more over the production than Cammell , which is just an assumption based solely on Roeg's other films , which , in fact , bear a great deal of resemblance to Performance's impressionistic take on time and setting and mood and a rhythm that seems to be all inside of his head . Whatever happened in the two years this was shelved by Warners in the editing room was probably all for the better ( or for the worse depending on your perspective ) . It's certainly a helluva lot more substantial than your common hippie-exploitation flick . The story runs not very deep , which is fine . Chas ( James Fox , perfect for this slightly cool , slightly psycho part ) is a full-time gangster running for an a-hole of a boss who thinks Chas goes too far with the execution of his duties ( i . e . shaving a guy to make a point while burning his car ) . When Chas gets paid a visit by some dudes looking to rough him up , the bloke has got to split fast so as to not get the in the wrath . He hears about a pad that could be a good bet to hold up in , not a hotel but just a room in the basement level of a ' flat ' . In it are Turner ( Mick Jagger ) , and a couple of ladies who live with this retired pop-star who's surrounded himself with a host of psychedelic paraphernalia and regalia : Eastern design , incense and candles , and of course the drugs . Soon Chas gets into this scene , albeit it's not in a form of exploiting the subject matter like " hey , you're square , join us , drop some acid , get high , expand your mind , etc " . On the contrary , there's almost a tone to the proceedings that is somewhat critical of this place and time , where there's total abandon of the rest of civilization and a total adherence to a controlled chaos and escapism ( or enlightenment , take your pick ) with drugs . This almost in spite of the style of the picture , Roeg's superlative camera-work as he makes his compositions into forms that look like they're not of this common movie world : close-ups merge into wide-shots , the folds of menace coming around like the cutaways to the trial early in the picture where shots seem subliminal , deranged , even satirical . But nothing beats how the editing works , which aside from Woodstock was the best editing in a movie in 1970 . Even for Roeg , who's reputation is built by his stand as an iconoclast in this arena , he makes this structure like one sees memory , association with images , thoughts , moods , colors , beauty and horrors and other madness , all through cuts and such ( just watch how he splices in the gangsters splashing the room with blood , or the mushroom shots , which seem like they influenced some shots in Magnolia ) . And let's not forget Jagger , shall we ? He goes between actually delivering a performance , so to speak , and being what one imagines Jagger , from his outlandish and sensationalized persona in the Rolling Stones , to be just regularly . He's not worried about looking glammed , or even like he's a girly with his long hair and makeup and sensual attitude , but any moment he's on screen , alongside an already good Fox and fellow cut and luscious ladies , it's hard to take his eyes off him . This goes without saying his character is sort of meant to create a lot of strange mischief , and sometimes he trails the film off further from any coherency than it already has as some experimental piece of would-be agitprop . But damned it all to bloody hell if it isn't a showstopper when as if in the midst of some Big Lebowski hallucination he becomes clean-cut ( or as clean-cut as Jagger can get ) , and ' performs ' " Turner's Song " , with an incredible beat like a lost Stones track , put to a scene filmed still in step with the rest of the movie , but great as a stand-alone effort . As mentioned , it IS dated , even with its stylistic influence on future film and filmmakers . This is its only main drawback from what is otherwise a daring act of avant-garde treatment of would-be genre material ( gangster holding up after a botched job , other gangsters on his trail , et all ) . It is , at least , a happening , and it freaks me out !
510126	453068	21576	8.0	the sights ( no sounds ) of Nice ; a little aimless , but captivating	If you're not awake for it A Propos de Nice could be a little boring , or just a little tiresome . There's no real specific ' point ' to the visual , silent documentary that is Jean Vigo's first film , though what is and what isn't shown does strike some interest , along with some other miscellaneous images . It starts off with a spellbinding ( and for the time revolutionary ) image though , of the city of Nice seen from an angle high above in a plane . From there Vigo shows the upper class life , the vicariousness , the fun ( driving cars , swimming in the ocean , going to nice restaurants , dancing ) , and then the film ends with a strange mix of images of smoke and fire and smokestacks and people laughing in close-up . The best thing about this film , which doesn't run too long , is that there's a free-form approach to getting the city . It's part of what were called the ' city symphony ' documentaries , where filmmakers just took there cameras around the city , getting images that delighted , or shocked , them . The film goes by with some strange camera moves , some low-angle perspectives of women doing the ' can-can ' , and more smiling . But probably the most provocative ( and my favorite ) image of the film is when there is a woman's body on a chair , we see her in different pieces of clothing , until she's nude . Is this surrealist , or just experimenting in form ? It's not like a Bunuel film because it's more about getting the scenery and shapes of the buildings in Nice than fing with the audience . But on the other hand , there is a mix of Freudian qualities to the film , as were in a few independent filmmakers at the time . It's both exhilarating and a little dull - with the wrong soundtrack ( I saw it with a common baroque score ) its interest swings depending on the moment . If I can find it , I'd watch it again , especially after seeing more of Vigo's works .
509302	453068	299458	8.0	slice of love story Sundance fest style : strong pros , some cons , all David Gordon Green	All the Real Girls is a love story , but according to director David Gordon Green on the DVD he would almost not want to explain what it's about . The reason for this turns out to sound , perhaps , a little too high-minded or poetic , maybe just pretentious , as he expounds upon the way the sun hits the two and a half legged dog and that that's what the movie is ' about ' . In short , he explains , the movie is just about how we are . That's possibly a good way of explaining it , or reasoning it or whatever , since the film is not entirely classifiable almost in spite of its more typical and tender elements . But as a work of a director like Green it is something that is all his own , for better or worse ( mostly for better ) , which is something that has been seen in the work he's put out so far with the possible exception or amendment of Pineapple Express . It's by no means a really great love story nor a really great film . Yet as someone who has tried to crack writing his own relationship dramas , this struck a chord . There are real scenes of truth , of revelation and insight , and tenderness and the resolve to try and accept the way things are which can never be done . Paul Schneider plays a character named Paul ( how close to real life I leave to you to figure on ) , who is something of a town Lothario , albeit not really proud of it as we later learn . He and Noel ( Zooey Deschanel ) fall for each other despite the angry protest of her hick brother Tip . We then see the relationship unfold as something of a first-young love scenario , both for Paul and for virgin Noel , and how it plays out against some more specific drama and character interplay with Paul's frustrated hospital-clown mother ( Clarkson ) and friend Bust-Ass ( Danny McBride ) . As tends to happens in certain young-love movies , there's something that happens that occurs that mucks the whole thing up - more-so for Paul than Noel in one of those ' funny ' kind of hard to take ways - and yet Green even treats this as well as other tougher moments with care and attention to how real and awkward and truthful the actors should play it . This doesn't necessarily mean all the scenes work completely or feel a little jagged with the patient ( not really slow ) pacing . But when they do work they work very well , like a confession Noel makes to Paul in the hotel room , or a silly scene at a bowling alley . And while Green paints his ' canvas ' of sorts with this sleepy blue-collar North Carolina town with some arty montages ( the SKY , the high-speed factory , hills and landscapes , pretty pictures ) , the actors are surprisingly good with seeming to do so little . Part of that is the subtle strengths in the writing , and some of it is just how Scheider and Deschanel keep things simple and sensitive . Even Whigham has a good scene expanding his character . Clarkson is also a given for doing small wonders on screen . If it's not quite one of the most mind-blowing romance films I've seen this decade , it might be that I wasn't entirely in the right frame of mind , or didn't find all of the little scenes with the supporting characters worked as well as the central " plot " ( in quotes for redundancy ) , or that the music is sometimes placed in ill-fitting scenes or is too sappy for my taste . These criticisms aren't to say it's a very well accomplished effort , a small and intelligent picture that doesn't cheat on its characters . It is familiar , and it feels very much a true Sundance fest effort , but it's better than others I've come across for its originality and tact .
509841	453068	65622	8.0	the sly and slightly crazy satire of church and sex	Pier Paolo Pasolini has with the Decameron what is supposedly one of his " happiest " movies . This is not to say the film is always cheery - matter of fact a couple of the stories deep down are pretty dark and sad and cursed thanks to the repression of religion and mortal sins - but Pasolini's comedy here is sharp and his wit comes out in the obscene or in the random . It's a little like Bunuel only with a more earthy sensibility with the locations and slightly less surreal situations ; it doesn't mean that Pasolini is any less ambitious with treating the foibles and stringent ways of the Catholic Church . The Decameron's only big liability , in my estimation , is that it could be easy to get lost in the structure Pasolini sets up ; it's nine stories , ranging from a Sicillian being swindled after finding out he's a brother to a sister of royalty until he's covered in feces , to a supposedly deaf-mute boy who becomes the sex toy for a bunch of sex-starved nuns , to a supposed ' Saint ' who fools a priest into thinking he's such with his lackluster confessional , to a girl being met by her boyfriend on the roof and then being ( joyfully ) caught by her parents since his family is wealthy . They're all interesting stories , more often than not , with even a really short piece like the priest attempting to seduce his friend's wife providing something amusing or eye-catching visually . But , again , all of these stories go from one into the next without much warning , and one may wonder when the next story really begins or if it's a continuation of the last . As it turns out , like the Phantom of Liberty , it's very stream-of-consciousness and one skewering of morality and sex can bleed easily into the other . And yet some may find this to be a more daring strength than others ; certainly it's a very funny movie ( if not quite as funny as Pasolini's masterpiece The Hawks and the Sparrows ) , like with the bit of the guy caught in the tomb , to the frankness of the parents asking the boy to marry their daughter on the rooftop - even just the strange feeling one gets watching the painter ( played by , I think , Pasolini himself ) in the act of creating an unusual but unique work on a church wall . The greatest thing of all , for fans of the subversive , is that nothing is out of bounds for Pasolini , via his source material of the Boccaccio book , and he never is one to ever shy away from sex . That's also another asset this time around - unlike Arabian Nights we get some actually erotic bits thrown in the midst , if unintentionally , and on occasion ( i . e . the shot following Lorenzo as he runs by the fence ) the director conjures something powerful amidst the medieval / surreal / neo-realist pastiche .
510185	453068	69995	8.0	leaves you with an uneasy feeling watching it , and I mean that , strangely , as a compliment	Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Back takes the premise of parents coming to grips with the tragic and untimely death of their daughter like a paranoid thriller , but not in the sense that it always will keep you on the edge of your seat . On the contrary , there are stretches in the film where you wonder where it will be going ( early in the film more-so than other parts , though this is part of Roeg's design as it unfolds ) . As their other child , a son away at boarding school , gets sick and Julee Christie's character - who has been given a chilling premonition by a blind Italian lady while the two of them , the other played by Donald Sutherland , are in Venice - goes to see to him , the results start to affect Sutherland's character . He sees someone in a red coat , in quick glimpses , and even thinks he sees Christie again . But is there a plot growing in the works ? Is he seeing what he thinks he is , or does he lose his rationality ? Like Roeg's previous film , Walkabout , there are times when the story is taking such a leisurely pace that it has to be on part of the audience to stay with it . But Roeg twists the screws just slightly , making little things and the attention to details via quick edits , super-impositions , that darn abstraction of the red-mark ( which , by the way , shows up later in a church Sutherland is remodeling ) , that one doesn't want to look away . It is , on the one hand , sort of cheating for what its core audience might want - it doesn't get very much suspenseful until the last ten minutes or so , when finally the stakes are raised just enough through circumstance , and Sutherland succumbing to what he early on had warned Christie off of ( believing the blind lady out of some idea that the daughter was still alive ) . On the other hand , it's not exactly about the suspense anyway : it's taken from a short story by the same author who provided stories for some of Hitchcock's films ( Rebecca and The Birds ) , and while it could be said that the filmmaker doesn't shy away from a twist at the end or with some direct musical choices throughout ( albeit Roeg doesn't quite get a Herrmann here ) , it's less about that than about the mind losing a stake in what may or may not really be happening . Is it paranoid if it's really happening to you ? Roeg seems to suggest paranoia following the character ( is there a plot surrounding Sutherland and Christie , the blind lady , the detective , the strange murders occurring ) , but his style isn't that of a Hitchcock . He'll linger on some scenes , make some flashes to others , and it sort of put me in a strange mood watching it , almost like watching Antonioni ( and even then a comparison is hard to do as the style of both with the camera is separate ) . What Don't Look Back does is surprise the viewer , if not completely successfully in terms of genre than as something reaching outside the bounds of it , and that's what makes it work as well as it does ( if at all ) so many years later . The editing is especially good , as was with Walkabout ( watch the cross-cutting between the steamy , " real " husband-wife kind of sex scene and the two of them getting dressed the next day ) , the mood has a eerie effect without over-stepping itself , and there's also one of the most disturbing killers from a 1970s film . And it goes without saying that Sutherland and Christie both turn in fantastic work here ( the former probably more than the latter , if only because of his amount of screen time outranking the other ) .
510655	453068	64689	8.0	more impressive as a time capsule / social document than as a rock concert film	At the height of the hippie culture and music scene , filmmaker DA Pennebaker went to the first ' event ' concert . It lasted three days in Monterey California , and hosted almost all of the pivotal , immortal acts in the rock n roll scene of the say - Simon and Garfunkel , the Mamas & the Papas , Canned Heat , the remnants of The Byrds and Buffalo Springfield ( later CSNY ) , Big Brother & the Holding Company ( with Janis Joplin ) , the Who , Jimi Hendrix , and even a special appearance from Ravi Shankar . It's a shame that it's sort of a let-down for a rock fan such as myself . It's not that the performers aren't in their peak form , or that it is filmed poorly ( most of the time Pennebaker and his photographers - one of them the incomparable Al Maysles - work in the roots of cinema verite in their documentary approach ) . The songs themselves aren't really the choice peaks . Some of them are , but some of them aren't , and the overall ( and kinda over-bearing ) air of the hippie world is a little much . The difference between Monterey Pop and Woodstock is that the later combined a focused , absorbing look at the audience while giving room for the prime cuts of the best sets from the acts . At the length of Monterey Pop , which is a third of the length of Woodstock , it's too short . And yet there is much to admire and watch for , aside from the appeal of it being a period piece . Jimi Hendrix , in his first American show after forming the Experience , gives a drug-loaded showstopper ( and one of his most revered and almost over-rated trademarks ) of lighting his guitar on fire after going through a blistering , raw rendition of ' Wild Thing ' . The look on the audience during this scene is priceless . The Who are very good , if a little under-used ( I've seen their performance from the show of ' A Quick One While He's Away ' that is ten times better than their ' My Generation ' encore in the film ) . Big Brother / Joplin and Simon & Garfunkel give soulful , peaceful numbers . And the final act - Shankar - is absolutely mesmerizing , showing how much he was ahead of his time with music ( his speed and inventiveness with the sitar rivals most of the great hard rock guitarists ) . It's not the best of the ' peace & love ' rock docs , but if you're into it anyway you should see it at least once .
510395	453068	53146	8.0	if you watch it for the spectacle , music , and often terrific direction , you'll get your money's worth	I don't know why though I didn't find Black Orpheus to be a flat-out , blow-me-away masterpiece . Maybe my expectations were a little high ; hearing for years about it from my mother ( into Brazilian music ) , and that it won a simultaneous golden palm and Oscar in 1959 . And for quite a while , despite being directed by Marcus Camus ( French ) , and meant for a worldwide audience , was THE film to see from Brazil and Rio . What is interesting , and occasionally a little frustrating , is how the film is shot actually not too complicated , the camera never does any moves that boggle the mind too much , or go into jump-cuts in editing . It's actually in a kind of documentary / realism ( which was Camus's style anyway ) capturing the lives of the poorer people of Rio and also the living-for-dancing kind of life they lead , keeping some hope . This , however , is mixed with the mythical story of Orpheus , who deals with death in order to save his love . But in a way , not all the time but some of the time , for me , the Orpheus story , despite being integral to the film , got in the way of some of the more exciting parts of the film . Obviously , the chief reason to see the film is for the entertainment value , which is pumped up by delivering dancing , a pulsating musical beat , and what ends up getting filled into the not-too-static framing ; a lot of dancing , and a lot of people , practically all non-actors I'd imagine , delivering the goods . And then the storyline comes in . Orpheus is a bus worker who also has a great gift for romancing through the guitar and his looks . It doesn't help his new engagement that a cousin of a friend , Eurydice , comes into the picture and changes everything - they fall in love , the kind of melodramatic , powerful kind of love that is affecting in its classic-film kind of style . . . and then there's Death , who's following along her trail . It's done as a kind of literal interpretation , and one wonders how things may lead up to a tragic climax . It's woven together fine , but I wasn't as moved by the romantic scenes so much as the others involving the real people . In fact , one wonders what this film could've been , either better or maybe not as good , if it was a straight documentary ala Orson Welles's It's All True about the lives of the poor in Rio who get together to Samba the night away . It's really exhilarating to see the sequences of the carnival , and even the ' rehersal ' that takes place in the smaller part of town . There is also one other scene that had me sit up and take notice - when Orpheus , on the search for Eurydice , is with his ' guide ' being a janitor , he's taken to a kind of voodoo room where spirits take control over people in the midst of a weird dance . I didn't understand this scene , like it was something alien to a far extreme . But it was one of my favorite parts of the film as well , for the power in seeing these real people act in this - for them - ' normal ' kind of act . Maybe I'll like it more on another viewing , for now though I did like it , and would recommend it , and to whom I'm not totally sure . Yet it is one of the seminal films from their country .
508389	453068	74695	8.0	a little spotty , some acting flaws , but it's still got the verve and punch of a harrowing anti-war classic	There are reasons I could not recommend Cross of Iron , but they're mostly surrounding little things that strike as being a little more ' ordinary ' or just conventional . There's some moralizing from the perspective of the German side , there's a little acting that doesn't quite click ( mostly due to accents that are a little forced ) , and there's only so much character development to keep the story moving . But those facets are tolerable , even sometimes compelling . What does make the movie highly recommendable , however , is that as with every film he made , to one degree or another , it's a Sam Peckinpah movie . What you see from Peckinpah is what you get , and this time it's in the form of a war movie . It fits that he would make a war movie ; the iconic scenes of the Wild Bunch where Peckinpah lets loose in his style of slow-mo violence on its western heroes , it's like it's ripped out of an operatic battle scene . So is the case with Cross of Iron that Peckinpah is phenomenally successful in portraying war as chaos , as battles rage and it becomes part of the narrative that we don't know who's fighting who . It's in the editing , and in the ( occassionally overwrought ) slow-motion speed , not to mention the various squibs , that make Cross of Iron hit so harshly . On a low-budget , Peckinpah makes the most of his resources , and relies on montage and the inherent idea that war , especially when on he point of view of the side that will lose , is the most horrible concept realized by men in power . And sometimes Peckinpah , also in tune with his usual idiosyncratic method of editing in other scenes as cut-aways , drives the point home on a psychological level . Steiner ( James Coburn ) is a good soldier , a very professional one , who will lead his platoon despite the fact , as he tells James Mason's Captain , that he hates the uniform , hates officers , hates himself in his own skin . And sometimes he'll flash to a moment , a visual , that makes his journey all the more personal . Coburn brings it out in his personality , a kind of look that's intense , thoughtful , and always on edge . He plays this dangerous but ethical man to his logical conclusion , leading up to the ending where he finally breaks out in a desperate , maniacal laughter at the absurdity he's in . As said , it's not a great film . It shows that Peckinpah was working with independent financiers that gave him only so much to work with . But it's hard to look away at times from what Peckinpah gives with what he's got . There's one of the most interesting scenes of any war movie here , not in a battle , but in a sort of " filler " scene - Steiner's platoon comes upon a Russian house full of women , some soldiers , after crossing over a protected bridge . There's a sense of peril in this scene , of multiple rapes about to occur . But then there's a morality here that's expressed too , with an unexpected moment with a sex act , and a naked woman bathing in a barrel . The acting here is some of the best in the movie , where all of the looks from the actors , many of them likely non-professionals , tell all there needs to be said about the smaller tragedies , the ones that get overlooked when looking at the big battles and strategies ala Stalingrad . Peckinpah gets so much right with scenes like these , with taut editing and a graphic vibe , as he does in other portions of the picture , that it's forgivable for what he gets wrong . It's a balancing act he , thanks to Coburn , pulls off excitingly .
510607	453068	57261	8.0	some of the most memorable child acting outside of a musical or comedy	I was one of a handful of kids who didn't get to read Lord of the Flies at the time when it would've been most appropriate - back in grade school where I could relate to what is the quintessential story of boyhood Id gone amuck ( that is Id without any girls or parental guidance ) . So I had to be content with , years later , watching the film . It turns out to be something very fascinating ; very naturalistic ( the film was mostly improvised by its young cast ) and with breathtaking black and white cinematography . It's the classic story of a bunch of kids marooned on a deserted island with nothing but their wits and most barbaric instincts as young men ( emphasis on men , British no less ) , and what it is to be apart , or decidedly not part , of a herd . And while I wasn't completely blown away by the production , I could see the definite admiration for the source . As for the film , Peter Brook crafted something unique in that he got a bunch of kid actors , pretty much all of them first timers and non-professionals , and made them about as believable as can be possible in a drama . Aside from some other examples like Shoeshine or Stand by Me ( though the latter is more comedy / drama ) , Lord of the Flies showcases these young talents so much in a raw style , and often to heartbreaking and almost anthropological effect , that you can't take your eyes away from it . It's by now means flawless and occasionally suffers from its improvised expression of narrative , but the positive results are so strong it's kind of a sleeper must-see of the 1960s , at least in British cinema .
509759	453068	74811	8.0	ingenious in its own Twilight Zone approach , but doesn't quite feel like a major Polanski work	I can understand how fans of filmmaker Roman Polanski could love this movie - and I could understand how some could totally hate it ( Ebert was one of the few who couldn't understand why people weren't running out of the theater ) . After a first viewing , I'm not sure I could fall into either category , however as someone who can't get enough of Kafka and bizarre dark comedies of paranoia The Tenant is effective enough for its running time . Or maybe not - this is one of those cases where it might have been more of a masterwork if it were a half-hour Twilight Zone episode , with Serling delivering the coda as Terkovsky ( or whomever it might be ( ? ) ) writhes in his bed in bandages . It's very similar in the treatment of the doomed protagonist as Repulsion was , however it could be argued that there was more ambiguity , more of a sense of the surreal coming out through a sustained disintegration of character and location ( and , quite frankly , a better lead performance ) than the Tenant . As it stands , The Tenant does have an intriguing premise , the kind that one doesn't tire telling about to other people : Polanski is a Polish émigré to Paris who takes an apartment that was most recently acquired by Simone Choule , who jumped to her near death out of the window and died soon after . But the other tenants are conservative to the max in terms of noise ; after a Saturday night at Terkovsky's with a few friends , there are complaints of too much noise . It won't happen again , Polanski's good-natured but slightly nervous tenant says , but there is no peace even in moving a cabinet or a chair . Soon complaints get registered against another tenant , but from him ? Can he register complaints ? This is a case of not so much mistaken identity but of there being a lack of peace of mind with oneself and the surrounding people . As the downward spiral goes on , Polanski ratchets up tension ( and , dare I say , black-comedic laughs ) by showing Terkovsky in the midst of a horrible dream - one of Polanski's strongest scenes from the period - and in finding teeth in the wall , not to mention the bathroom across the way ( which , I might add , is always a cinematic lynch-pin of horror and surreal madness ) . But somehow , the film never really feels all that significant aside from its excessive design as a would-be mind-f machine , with Terkovsky's tenants only seeming to not be what they seem for a little while : there's not as much suspense when finding out that they really aren't out to get him , which makes the paranoia more self-fulfilling . At least once or twice I thought to myself as well ' why did Polanski take the title role for himself ? ' It's not that he's at all a bad actor , and he has appeared in several films and plays that aren't of his own direction . But aside from being great at looking awkward and tense , like in the church , or in his moments of sort of flipping out when thinking that they really are out to get him to kill himself , his transformation is less creepy than tongue-in-cheek , a test of himself to see if he can pull it off , which he doesn't entirely do . Despite Polanski working at it well to look like the meek and frazzled Terkovsky , I could see at least a few other actors who could pull it off with more subtlety and affecting personality . By the time one sees him in drag , it goes between cringe-worthy and true camp , particularly when he goes for the double-climax at the end ( which , of course , is of little surprise ) . And yet there is pleasure for the film-buff and Polanski fan to see the supporting cast try and dig into the much more ambiguous characters ( Winters and Douglas do this the best , even as they have to strain through limited characters ) , and the unexpected moments like Polanski and Adjani getting hot and heavy during a Bruce Lee movie , or when he gets really drunk , or in one almost random scene where he slaps a kid near a fountain , are rather brilliant in and of themselves . It's a very good film , and one that could maybe stick my attention up when on too many coffees after midnight . But an essential film ? Not exactly .
509548	453068	285005	8.0	a crime film that focuses more on the personal side of the hit-man , of innocence shattered , and the possibility for redemption	Takashi Miike's Dead or Alive 2 : Birds is loaded with allegory and symbolism , some that works ( like having feathers continually popping up from time to time in the midst of murders , or the sometimes mentioned comet representing wonder in the unknown ) and some that doesn't ( the re-appearances of the wings on the backs of Mizuki and Shu , and the over-usage of archive clips of impoverished people in Africa to emphasize the two hit men's end goal to donate all their money to that ) . But at the core Miike has a very thematically rich film , where the insanity , shame and / or brutality of bloodshed and violence and death are contrasted with what comes before people go down the path of crime - childhood . It's maybe that one is given sight to bloody scenes in person as a child , as Mizuki does when he sees his step-father dying on the bathroom floor dialing on the phone ( one of the great images in the film ) . Or it's just that there doesn't seem to be much of a choice , or out of convenience , it's hard to say . Miike isn't out for easy answers anyway , but after a sort of bizarre meditation on the loss of the innocence we all have in youth , and how it can become uglier and without meaning . It's also , on to of this , a very good story of friendship and ties that bind that friendship going beyond professional duty or consequence . Mizuki and Shu , played by Riki Takeuchi and Sho Aikawa , also from the first DOA ( however not connected by character or plot , only in part by mood ) , are hit men for a hire , and Mizuki , who hasn't seen Shu in many years , witnesses him kill a bunch of gangsters that he was supposed to fire on with a sniper . He follows him , and it leads the both of them , as they're in hiding for suspected / actual murders and money stolen , to the island of their youth . We see flashbacks of said childhood , of fun playing on the beach ( a sweet gag , uncommon for Miike , is when one of the kids is buried in the sand and the other kids run away ) , but also the pain of separating and finding violence among them , like with Mizuki . Nostalgia comes back tenfold , as they reunite with another old friend , and Miike actually crafts sentimental scenes in this middle chunk that work , somehow , because they don't feel very cheap . Then , as if trying to cleanse themselves of their old crime-syndicate ways , they work at a playground helping out kids , and they even put on a demented play involving goofy innuendo with Cinderella and various animals . This play scene is juxtaposed with the sprawling yakuza / triad warfare that breaks out back at home , and it's here that Miike has not only , for my money , the best sequence of the film , but one of his best sequences to date . The play Mizuzki , Shu and the others put on is immature and a little crude , but shown to be all the more innocent and playful when compared to the manic , multiple murders that occur between the two gangs , as bullets fly , blood flows , and bodies contort all over the place as neither side really comes out victorious , or with many members left . It's Miike leashing out his wicked , no-holds-barred style , but also the goodness on the other side of the coin , and it doesn't get much better for a fan like myself . On the other hand , Dead or Alive 2 , following this sequence , gets weirder by the minute , and sometimes not always for the best . With the focused narrative flow given for the Mizuki / Shu story , where they decide to come back to the mainland and keep going with their killings for money in un-selfish reasons , there's another subplot involving , I'd guess , the other killers out to kill them . But it comes off muddled , and even with Miike going for enjoyably crazy images like a midget walking on stilts , or the fate of a character named Jiro , it suddenly felt as if Miike was getting off track of what was working best . But if anything , DOA 2 tops the first one by delivering the goods on substance just as well as the style . Miike is always out for experimentation , with his editing and transitions and usage of a symbolic inter-title " Where are you Going " . And isn't above getting some touching last scenes with Mizuki and Shu on the boat ( Takeuchi , by the way , is one of Miike's best actors ) , even if it feels very sudden , that could be forced by another director but through him feel compassionate to their doom . While Miike and his screenwriter don't quite get deep enough to make this a great film about lifelong criminal friends , and he's still into getting laughs out of depraved acts of violence and bizarre sex ( i . e . that giant penis in a couple of scenes ) , it's surely one of the better yakuza movies I've yet to see to go past its limitations and make it a movie where the main characters aren't just cardboard cut-outs meant for shouting dialog and dying at a clip .
510613	453068	60305	8.0	not bad at all , actually very good and meticulously structured heist movie , but not great	I had seen nearly everything that is readily available from Jean-Pierre Melville in the United States by the time I got to Le Deuxieme soufflé , which may be part of why I didn't respond overwhelmingly to it . After such challenging , methodical and precisely existential crime masterpieces as Le Samourai , Le Cercle Rouge , Bob le flambeur and the underrated Le Doulos , this one just seemed to not pack the same kind of punch that the others did . Again , this may be the fault on the viewer for seeing this last among his mostly thriller-oriented oeuvre , but perhaps it's also some of Melville's fault too ; again and again , as the dedicated and ruthless auteur that he was ( one of the great French directors I would argue ) , he kept coming back to men in trench-coats with grim expressions figuring out on both sides - criminal and detective - of how to plot the next move or , for the former , how to keep from the fatalism of the plot . Which , for Melville , is something that comes second nature . The difference , perhaps , in this case is that the length ( a whopping two and a half hours , longer than both The Red Circle and Army of Shadows ) and the amount of details in the structure of the story ( i . e . what happened on such and such a day made this happened could've been snipped , albeit I can't pinpoint to which ) bog down some of the more successful aspects to the picture . Which is also to say that for all of its minor misgivings , Le Deuxieme soufflé ( or , simply , The Second Breath ) is near-classic Melville , with nail-bitingly tense suspense scenes like the opening escape from the prison and the latter heist sequence - somewhat more obvious and less coolly ambitious as Red Circle . There's the amazing cinematography as well , a trademark of Melville and his crew to make things gritty but smooth in precision and style , and the performances from Paul Meurisse as the Detective ( maybe my favorite performance of the picture just for the intelligence he imbues in the character ) , and Lino Ventura as one of the quintessential Melville anti-heroes , Gu , the convict who wants in on the big 200 million heist . And even as it could be Melville's most " talky " picture after Bob le flambeur ( which is relative to how pleasantly light , or how seemingly sparse , his films are with dialog ) , when the characters speak it's to the point of with some quotable spunk to them . There's an icy , unspoken angst in Melville's world of criminals , almost questioning but still true to the notion of the ' policier ' , where you'd want the criminals to get away with it if the detective wasn't so doggone determined all the time . It's another fine piece of film-making from the director , just not an all-time-top flick - more along the lines of Un flic .
510302	453068	179074	8.0	pimpin ' ain't easy , but it sure is fun , as the song goes	American Pimp , a film by the Hughes brothers , is probably more entertaining , almost in a manner that crosses between a typical documentary and as one of the film clips shown from the Mack as an exploitation film , than it deserves to be . But then the Hughes brothers have made a film about exploitation , the self-glorified glory of it , the stylish inner world that they've created for themselves and their ' ho's ' that is like the mob only , well , more stylish and specific . Unlike the mob , as the film tries to show ( however true to life compared with facts you be the judge ) that they aren't all violent criminals , but see it as a way of life . The Hughes's - maybe wisely and not wisely at the same time - don't try and interfere with these guys and their dialog . There's no preachy message that " pimping and prostituting is wrong . " They know audiences aren't completely numb to what the facts are in a ( for now ) criminal enterprise . But , as I said , it's also entertaining , the kind of entertainment that comes from listening to someone you know is crazy or f up and at the same time has a weird , hypnotic quality . They go through telling what it's all about - the breaking in , so to speak , of new prostitutes for the pimp , when said prostitutes might leave , the ins and outs of being a new pimp or an old pimp or someone who talks a big game and may or may not mean what he says . Actually , for the latter , the Hughes's don't seem to skimp on any of their interviewees : they all appear to be genuine to the business , appear being the big word . But it's the intent that counts , and these guys at least sound the part , as well as look it , and in a dirty way these guys are really , really funny , sometimes without trying to be even due to their own self-aggrandizing . As for the prostitutes themselves , they are shown not quite as much . While it might have been difficult for the Hughes's to get any legitimate documentary footage of them , aside from a couple of moments revealed like when a pimp named RC ( I think that's his name ) berates a girl for getting drunk , with the menace of violence in the subtext , it works fine as it is . It's like a candid string of tall tales from characters painfully believable , as those who think that the media portrays them stereotypically , and why not ? Some of these guys ARE walking stereotypes - doesn't stop them from getting their pimp-hand on . It ain't easy , but it's almost in a guilty way insatiable .
508396	453068	817910	8.0	a dark romp with vampires and ghosts	Hellboy : Blood and Iron is about vampires coming back after many , many years in wait , and also about ghosts and memory and all those things left behind . If it were about these things more-so in-depth ( or rather the kind of attention that Guillermo del-Toro would pay to the subject matter if he directed ) , it would be really great material . Trouble is , the Hellboy animated movies , with this the second installment , are limited by means of budget , time , and even to an extent the scripting . There's a lack of the dry , sly and just outright clever humor from the Hellboy live-action movies , with only one or two quips from ol ' Red ( Ron Perelman , always good even in dull one-liners ) , and some characterizations and dialog that are as routine as whatever one might find in a straight-to-video release . These flaws being noted , Blood and Iron is extremely enjoyable for what it can afford in its 75 minute running time , which is giving some lifeblood to a comic-book that needs it desperately . The plot works mostly upon the strengths of the animators , and luckily they are many . What might seem ordinary and traditional - even a little lacking in fluidity ( again , budget ) - gives way to extraordinary moments going past the expected for " kids " stuff . There's some very dark material particularly in this installment , as we see an iron goddess , a vampire curse , a couple of blasted witches , snakes , and those creepy ghosts ( which , thanks to some del-Toro presence , reminds one of the Gothic folklore of Mexico ) . It's all very impressive when it works best , and there's even some interesting designs for these villains and creatures of the night . There might not be much depth ( the climax is just a bunch of " we are not like them " semantics from the iron woman to Hellboy as they punch each other senseless ) , but for a short while it's some good fun and some brilliant animation , for what it's worth . Less than great , and at the same time far better than it should have any right to be .
508552	453068	86637	8.0	Funny film with exquisite editing	Woody Allen's Zelig is a funny and smart account of a fictional guy ( as in most Allen films ) who is a chameleon celebrity who blends in to whatever surrounds he has . More than humor , it shows how one struggles to be belonged in society and after being deemed a freak is bad . I found it funny as most Allen films ( not the best but up there ) with a nice touch .
509265	453068	222851	8.0	cold and dark and extremely ( but not excessively ) violent tale of Kitano in L	Brother is another of Takeshi Kitano's ' Yakuza ' thrillers , though this time the Yakuza are only a small part of the picture and only sometimes set in Japan . Akani ( Kitano ) is a hit-man who has bitten off more than he can chew - killed some of the wrong people , if at the right place at the right moment - and is advised to leave the country . He joins his brother in LA and soon he and a rag-tag group of hoodlums - mostly by way of the chilling , quiet audacity and cunning shooting skills of Anaki - rise the ranks as big-time crime lords in LA . . . that is , until , they mess with the Italians . This part of the story , admittedly , is rather typical and maybe just something Kitano felt he had to work with as one of those staples of the genre : rise and undoubted fall of a skilled but flawed criminal mastermind / killer . But Brother is most impressive not for its plot , which can occasionally appear ragged and disconnected ( perhaps by design as Kitano is the editor ) , but for presentation . Kitano himself as a presence / star / actor is so cool that had he been around during Melville's time he could wipe the floor with Alan Delon and even Belmondo in the bad-ass department . This is just one component to Brother's success though since Kitano could put himself in just about anything and make that part of it look cool . Coolness isn't enough in Brother , and rightfully so ; this isn't a fun movie entirely to watch , even if one might feel guilty in enjoying some of the more crazy shoot-outs and bouts of violence . The body count here , according to the trivia , is 78 . This is a high number , but despite seeing it in a cut R-rated version it doesn't feel very compromised ( mayhap it is and I'm being naive , but it's a first-time viewing all the same ) . It's a real sight to see to witness how Kitano makes these encounters of violence surprising ; the first big one , with the first time Omar Epps and Kitano run into each other on the street ( glass breaks , scoff and demand , glass cut to the face ) the way its edited is fantastic in timing and perception - not minimalist , but something a few beats different then what one would normally see . We also see Kitano's knack at unusual but inventive framing devices , like a dark , massive shoot-out under a bridge at night with warring gangs , and only the lights from the guns blazing off of the bodies . Other moments like these are a sight of bodies laid out in the Japanese word of " Death " , and when one gangster is already dead when a group in a car pull up to a house : Kitano focuses on that . The final shoot-out , as well , is unexpected . It's not a great movie , and suffers from the flaws mentioned at the top . Yet I'd recommend Brother to any genre fan , to those chest-deep in Yakuza flicks and one who's only aware of Kitano from Zatoichi . This is no Shoot Em Up , but a serious picture about the damning implications of a life devoted to self-destruction and annihilation for stupid , materialist and territorial goals . If it's not anything entirely new its film-making enriches what's conventional , and Kitano is always clever at bending the lines .
509659	453068	117028	8.0	great concert footage , good in-between bits	For fans of the musical acts that performed at this one of a kind concert , Isle of Wight is a must-see look . The interview sections are not of the high quality of those of Woodstock where you might have taken away something from what was being said . Here it's mostly a lot of ultra-hippie types ( one who apparently gave his 3 year old son acid and pot ) , as well as some British fellows who run the concert . These interviews are OK enough on their own , and maybe the biggest liability from Lerner on this end as well as the music is in the editing . It's only a 2 hour film , which regrettably ( like Monterrey Pop ) is way too short in viewing such a monumental moment ( and fleeting one like Altamont ) in such a short running time . Still , almost every musical act is worth checking out in their limited time frame , and a little extra sadness comes along in seeing that a few of these people didn't live long after the concert ended . Some of the memorable acts include the Doors ( all too brief of course ) , Jimi Hendrix ( ditto ) , the Who , Miles Davis ( in different form from his 50's days ) , Ten Years After , the Moody Blues , and Free .
508351	453068	90728	8.0	a little goofy , as off-the-wall as can be , but also - for the right viewer - just the ticket	Big Trouble in Little China is a movie that is perfect for me IF I'm in the right kind of mood . Sometimes I turn the channels and see this on and can't bear to watch it if I'm on one of those overly ' bad ' days . But if things aren't too bad , and nothing else is going on too troubling in the world , this film does the trick entertainment-wise . In some ways it might be director John Carpenter's most shamelessly entertaining genre flick , with it's hero ( Kurt Russell ) a truck driving near sailor-mouthed ( at least has the attitude to a T ) guy getting involved with a strange martial arts fantasy plot . Going into the film you should know a little background , like how the original title was going to be the sequel to the first Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai picture . It's almost too off-the wall at times , with some wild supporting characters thrown into the mix . To talk about the plot of the film might be moot ; it's suffice to say the film works because a ) Russell is at his best in one of his few Carpenter collaborations , with enough male swagger for any beer-drinking guy ; b ) the special effects and fight scenes , even by today's standards , are not that bad and even have an effect where a little-kid voice inside keeps saying " so awesome " ; and c ) as escapist entertainment , you could do a helluva lot worse .
508620	453068	66534	9.0	plenty of scabrous bits of Bunuel's Catholic - and faith-based - criticism and questioning ; the parts are much greater than the whole	I might be tempted to call the Milky Way a masterpiece , but for all of the excellent scenes that dance along on the edge of being silly , strange , dead-serious , and scathing in attack , Luis Bunuel doesn't make it quite an easy first viewing . It is , alongside Phantom of Liberty , though maybe more-so considering its picaresque flow , a difficult film to follow at times , as the folds go in and out of the two pilgrims on their way to Compostela as if in an ocean current . We see Jesus and his disciples . We see some 15th ( or 4th ) century sermons and heretic slayings and practices , sometimes seeming as mystical as something out of the Dark Crystal . And there's even a duel between two sides of the Catholic coin debating between specifics in the nature of god while fencing furiously . It's what could be defined , if one were looking for an easy label , true surrealism , pointed right at the edge of contradictions , of the daring of the random and of chances taken at the expense of all authority be damned , and at the same time it's a drama of fanaticism and faith in general . What is it to believe and actually buy into these guys , who at their most genial are storytellers and at their worst will burn you at the stake for not going for God in threes versus God as one ? Bunuel , at the least for his admirers , makes an attempt with his collaborator Jean-Claude Carriere , to raise questions in the midst of raucous entertainment . Although Bunuel can be even greater when being devilish and playful ( eg Discreet Charm ) , the Milky Way displays the filmmaker reveling in the history and nature of heresy in a construct that's maybe more daring . One truly can't expect what will come next , as one may see a scene with a priest flip-flopping about whether or not the Holy Ghost is in the communion wafer or not ( and soon thereafter taken back to the asylum ) , and then a scene with a rag-tag group of evangelicals in the woods who may or may not be paying heed to God , or to the Devil , or both , or a chef being questioned about how Jesus walked and then a cut-away to how Jesus really walked . As the two pilgrims go along their way , having their own delirious encounters - missing by a bit being struck by lightning , debating Christian free will , one hoping for a car to crash , which does , and then seeing some angel of death or other in the back-seat , and in their continuous streak of being turned away / kicked out by those who would take them in if not for essential hypocrisies - a pattern does start to form ( if one could call it that ) , or at least the essential pieces to Bunuel's puzzle . A lot of times one laughs at the subtlety and the outrageousness : should Jesus shave , do nuns crucify one another , how much can a priest pontificate about not having sex under any circumstances . But it's actually after the film ends that even more ideas start to come around . And yet Bunuel is so cunning , so deadpan with how he directs the actors - some part of his repertory , some not - that it skims into becoming straight drama , which in that case would make it almost dull ; the film actually faced some ( un-fair ) criticism when first released that Bunuel had suddenly made a film cherishing the things he used to damn . How curious , deranged , and honest even in this part of the appeal , the playing of both sides . While it is fairly well known that Bunuel became an atheist following a strict Catholic upbringing ( one quote of his , also the name of a documentary on the Criterion DVD , is " I'm an atheist , thank God " ) , it's never clear whether Bunuel will take one side or the other . There's things that are fed up about those who go without any question at all , like the little girls reciting verbatim on the stage , but also of what the man envisions of revolutionaries shooting the Pope in a firing line . Even for those who may consider themselves atheists , as Bunuel might have up to a point ( like Scorsese , no matter how much can be sort of dropped , there still remains chunks that stay as part of the auteur ) , and for those who are rigid believers , The Milky Way attempts to open up a discussion of dogma , heresies - many long forgotten before the writers dug them up in research - and why one should even believe if there is no definitive proof . For all of Bunuel's skewering of schizophrenic or quietly sex obsessed priests and moments of pure mystery like the man who first comes to the pilgrims , there is bits of reverence too , like for the Virgin Mary - who at times becomes part of the debate - and it's challenging and refreshing to see nothing left solidly as ' this is this for sure ' . If it may feel a little loose an imperfect on a first viewing it shouldn't detract from everything that can be taken away as pure food for Bunuelian thought .
510415	453068	245429	9.0	An anime treat	Spirited Away , the latest film from writer / director Hayao Miyazaki ( a genius to Disney animators , such as to Toy Story director Lasseter who executive produced the film for the US ) , is a wonderful family film , that works on numerous levels for kids , not the least being the creative storyline , and for older kids and adults there are lavish backdrops and characters right out of , well , an anime movie . The storyline , by the way , follows a girl and how she finds herself in a fantasy world where her parents have been transformed into pigs and spirits and other strange creatures prowl the landscape , and she has to everything she can to stay human and get a way back home , thought she'll need help along the way . A bit at times reminiscent of a Wizard of Oz or Alice In Wonderland in Japanese anime fashion ( perhaps building just on the fantasy elements as Miyazaki usually does ) doesn't disappoint for a moment as a marvel of imagination . Even those strident fans of maturer ( err extra violent ) anime pictures will want to look , maybe more than once . Works on many levels and I recommend it of course , if maybe a mild mark under Miyazaki's best work Princess Mononoke . ( or )
510216	453068	117561	9.0	an extremely personal , maddeningly absurd excursion into the loony side of Soderbergh ; one of the definitions of ' acquired taste '	From the prologue I instantly thought I understood the tone that Steven Soderbergh - writer , director , cinematographer , possible pornographer , and double-actor on Schizopolis - was going for : pure absurdism , not just with how the prologue is worded ( as the most important film experience of all time , the " full completed version " ) , but how he goes between all the different lenses like a young film student checking out the gears on a Bolex . But it's always a tricky thing going into a Soderbergh " experiment " , and that it could be a mish-mash like Full Frontal ( I've yet to see Bubble ) . And , in all truth , it is a mish-mash . It tells a coherent story only in that there's maybe two ( or three ) stories that seem to make any sense , but is scattered around scenes and freewheeling camera moves and editing tricks and music that come closest to that oft-mentioned critic term " off-beat " . And a lot of the time it seems to be so personal to Soderbergh ( real life ex-wife playing ex-wife , plus what may be his real kid playing Brantley's daughter ) , and so unconscionably irreverent , that it dares to run off the tracks any minute . But it's this fully realized move to just be silly and strange , to make just random moments of wild satire ( Rhode Island sold as a shopping mall , " Well , at least we didn't sell it to the fing Japanese " , and a man randomly getting caught up in a straight jacket by fellows from a mental hospital ) , more well-rounded jabs at the drudgery and pointless meandering of everyday white-collar work life ( is there a spy , or a mole , who cares if there's masturbation ? ) , and statements just abstracted as if done sort of by a spontaneous idea in the editing room ( title cards quoting a page in the script ? ) , that makes it such a daring work of ludicrous intentions . This isn't a filmmaker trying to make an innovative and possibly important film like Traffic , or even a fun mainstream romp like Ocean's Eleven . In fact , it's seeing the opening prologue , and seeing how the style takes off right away ( the title for the film on the shirt of a naked guy running away ! ) it sets off wonderful irony at every turn . Not that Soderbergh isn't being self-indulgent . In fact , I'm sure that's why there's something of an honesty to his going head-long into his own personal crises of dealing with a relationship or marriage , and throwing caution to the wind by making the emotional problems actually quite real while obfuscating them with some truly goofy vignettes . It's almost like directorial therapy : let the actors improvise , let it all be loose , and even have a truly warped storyline involving an exterminator , really an actor looking for motivation and a written scene ( ha ) , yet having in many instances moments of confession . Even if one might not know some of the circumstances surrounding Soderbergh's first marriage ( it's detailed in the book Rebels on the Backlot ) , it feels like it's coming from the heart a good lot of the time , which uplifts the comedy . A running gag late in the film , as certain scenes from earlier with the perfectly dead-pan Soderbergh and Brantley are repeated , has Soderbergh being dubbed over in Japanese , French , and Italian , though in scenes that involve break-ups , awkward sexual tension , and a reconciliation . This is not to say that Soderbergh isn't also more devilish than he's ever since been with his innuendo - make that outright hilariously immature sexual comedy - and it's amazing to see Soderbergh read a ' love letter ' he's written to his " Attractive Woman # 2 " , describing his profession of emotions in very graphic ways . And if Soderbergh does some strange things to surprise as the only time he's starred , let alone acted , in one of his films ( the scene where he's in the bathroom making faces at the mirror is one of those pure moments in absurd cinema that speaks to the success of paying homage to Richard Lester movies ) , his going for broke stylistically pays off too . Or doesn't , depending on how one can take the mix and match of film stocks used from grainy 16mm to the usual 35mm , jagged hand-held racing after the exterminator man beating up on a man and woman , extreme fast-motion film-speed , perfectly composed images like a boy in right field missing a baseball , and even documentary style in the scenes with T . Azimuth Schwitters . On top of the dialog being continuously crazy and self-conscious ( what's that film crew following along ? ) , it's possibly the best , or at least most fun , that Soderbergh has to offer as an independent filmmaker . So see it at your own risk , definitely check out the trailer beforehand to get an idea of what's at hand ( if the poster wasn't sign enough what a tailspin one can expect to get into ) , and if one is already a fan , if only in the guilty pleasure sort of way as I know I am , do check out the Criteron DVD for Soderbergh " interviewing " Soderbergh commentary , including the story how the deal for David Lean to direct two years after his death fell through ( damn Showtime channel ) !
508953	453068	51472	9.0	delightful in its frank and playful attitude to " Him " vs / with " Her "	Jean-Luc Godard must have known he would come back to Charlotte and Her Jules very soon after making it , since he recreated in Breathless , made at or around the same time as this last short he made before going head-on into features , a nearly 20 minute version of this scene only with a little more of an equal playing field . Meaning in this case it's all about the man , or rather " her " man , and in a small-term experimental sense it's quite successful . It's basically just a monologue Jean Paul Belmondo delivers to his girl following her return from being with " another " man , who apparently is waiting in his car on the street below . The monologue is so ranty Charlotte ( who as a clever and sneaky and telling trick by Godard gets top billing ) only gets in two lines , one of them her exit , " I just came for my toothbrush " , with all smiles going on , trying on a hat , occasionally whistling , while her man goes on and on . It was one of Godard's so often quoted idioms that it became cliché and then went back around to original and then in a circle forever and ever that " the history of cinema is men photographing women . " It is in this case that Godard practices this full-tilt ; while Belmondo ( with Godard dubbing ) gets all of the audio time , pontificating , complaining , praising , sarcastically reminiscing about the good times and bad times and harping both poetic and the self-conscious about himself and her , the camera is almost always on the pretty Anne Collette . Godard would return to usually keeping his camera on his " lady " be she Anna Karina , Bridgit Bardot or Anne Wiezemsky , but for right now it's perhaps best to consider this a practice run . Thankfully it's an extremely entertaining and curiously rigorous practice run , showcasing the attention to the opposite sexes plus flexing such muscles as breezy and quick cuts and the freedom and rough edges of a hand-held black and white camera . Ah , those were the days , before say the 1980s and 1990s came around .
510541	453068	79271	9.0	The Searchers redux - now with more Calvinism and porn !	Paul Schrader has admitted on more than one occasion that John Ford's the Searchers had a profound impact on him as a filmmaker and screenwriter ( inklings of it can be seen in Taxi Driver ) , and his second feature , Hardcore , has the theme of obsessive search for someone who may not even want to be found in full late 70s style and substance . Schrader has also made a very personal film , if one knows of his history : he grew up a strict Calvinist ( no movies until he was 17 , trembling just going into a movie theater ) , and then went out to Hollywood and went into the excesses ( drugs , women , movie-making ) . Hardcore is something of his own therapy , in a sense , as he comes to grips with growing up in a confining , ultra-religious Grand Rapids small town , and taking a character - George C . Scott's father figure - into a Dante-esquire journey into L . A . hell , as his daughter goes missing after leaving for a Calvinist retreat out west . On top of the homage for Ford's film , and with Scott in Wayne's role as a would-be hero that's far more complex , Hardcore is also like a mystery ' noir ' , where Jake VanDorn is in the seediest sections of L . A . trying to find any sign of recognition from people for his daughter . It would be one thing if Schrader made just a straight drama , with the opening scenes as the comfortable side that soon leads into the terrifying core of a whole industry based around sex and exploitation ( or just plain fun depending on the person ) . But there's also a heap of cynical humor , an edge that one saw spring up here and there in Taxi Driver . We see a porno producer shooting his first movie , which is amusing . We see Jake VanDorn go in disguise ( bad disguise , wig and moustache ) as a director auditioning for male actors , and at one point meets Big Dick Black , who is every 70s porno actor cliché in the book . And when Season Hubley's Niki comes to the scene , there are some moments that become more down-to-earth than one might expect from the conventional trajectory of the plot . Personally , I think the ending needed a little more clarity , or if it was the " happy ending " ( in quotes since it wouldn't really be one ) ala the Searchers , or maybe even a whole other route . What if VanDorn found her and didn't go home with her ? And what if there wasn't a huge climax of violence and bloodshed and breaking through walls in S & M apartments ? There's so much that feels really honest in the material , however strange or dark the material goes into , that one wonders if the ending makes total sense from what has followed leading up to it , which includes a daughter character we only know about as a " pure soul " . It goes without saying that Scott is terrific in the part , and he does a lot with the character even as we have to take him as he is with only bits of back-story ( i . e . divorced wife ) dripping in as the film goes along . He makes him believable even when he's a total , unwavering man-on-a-mission , and adds just that edge of complexity that's required with Schrader's text . Other players like Peter Boyle , Hubley , and Dick Sargent also provide some good supporting work . Bottom line , it's Searchers redux - not a masterpiece like the former , sure , but it's worth your while , and has an energy to it past its dated line of good old 70s porno backdrop .
510604	453068	94332	9.0	The songs Witchy Woman ( women ) meets Sympathy for the Devil , combined for a comic fantasy	George Miller ( Mad Max ) creatively sets the stage for a story of three witches and one Lucifer , who are in regular human form , in a small , uptight New England town . Of course , for a tale like this one can try to suspend disbelief , and it has to be when dealing with the supernatural . Thankfully , Miller has great casting tastes - Cher , Sarandon , and Pfieffer are wonderful in their roles , each with an acute , potent sexuality that was at their peaks in the late 80's . And then there's Mr shark grin himself , Jack Nicholson , who gives another superb layer to the performance of the dark prince . There are other actors who have portrayed the man downstairs - Al Pacino in Devil's Advocate was the devil as lawyer , Billy Crystal was himself in the Woody / Dante sequence in Deconstructing Harry , even Elizabeth Hurley in Bedazzled . But rarely have they had this much outright fun and charm with the role , enough to almost make me , a man in his 20s , charmed too . Maybe it's the eyebrows . Nicholson gives one of his best over-the-top performances as the " horny-little devil " Darryl , who comes into town during a storm and cooks up more than that for his avid female guests . Of course , he doesn't have control for long , when the girls find they have powers of their own . When the movie gets overly fantastic ( which is a number of times ) it gets a little hard to take , yet the acting is above par , and the special effects are a delight .
508592	453068	478311	9.0	a guide to having a baby , with stoners , and E ! news	My first reaction at the end of the film was probably too simplistic a comparison : Harold and Kumar meets Nine Months ( yes , the Hugh Grant / Julianne Moore pregnancy comedy from 95 ) . But the film actually carries off how so few romantic comedies know how - to actually give us a man and a woman to actually give a damn about . More than that , Apatow has matched extraordinarily well the shlubby but funny and down-to-earth skills of Seth Rogan with the vibrant , uncertain but ultimately believably conflicted personality in Katherine Heigl . It's a tough sell with it's premise , to be sure , that a very attractive E ! news reporter like Allison ( Heigl ) and a total stoner almost-bum like Ben ( Rogan ) could hook up over less than 12 hours and suddenly procreate , but there you have it . It's a premise that actually had me avoiding the film , even with the immense hype from critics as well as friends and family , because the footage shown in the trailer didn't seem to be that much to write home about . The actual finished product , however , is certainly the funniest American movie out so far in 2007 , pointed at the age variant of around 18 to , um , 37 maybe , with all of the supporting characters , as well as Rogan and co-star Paul Rudd as Heigel's brother-in-law via sister played by Leslie Mann , very sharp with levels of sarcastic wit and pop-culture references . At the same time Apatow gets some really amazing one-liners regarding Ben's friends joking on each other ( the bearded guy provides the most fodder , but the general attitude is ' hey , f it , lets get stoned " ) , but doesn't lose track of what he's trying to do , successfully . He's out to criticize as well as embrace a culture where responsibility for one's self has to do with how the other in the relationship is comfortable or dissatisfied with the other . And Apatow makes the Rudd / Mann relationship a kind of bittersweet ( much more bitter really ) counterpoint to the rocky start to Ben and Allison's ' shot-gun ' romance . There's silly one liners ( " I live in your phone ! " ) , goofy caricatures ( the gynecologists ) , smart aleck kids who know a lot of " bad " words that provides for some wicked laughs , and the usual mayhem in the delivery room an actual winner in terms of making it partly true and partly farce ( albeit Judd doesn't seem to understand , despite having three kids , what a woman is like throughout the labor process , as reconciliations don't usually happen aside from script contrivances ) . Yet all the while , it's a sincere film , with the relationships shown not as cardboard cut-outs but where the people actually have to deal , if eventually , with the lots in life they've got themselves into . What is it to balance love and commitment , Apatow is asking . There's even one shot that provides a note of discomfort with the characters of Ben and Allison as they have a bad argument in the car , the view being outside of the car in traffic , a distance kept because , and it's a credit to Apatow as a storyteller , we do care about what will happen in this situation . In fact , that's probably one of the best things to say about Knocked Up . Too often in movies , especially of the cineplex fare , the situation is more-so told than an actual story . This is one of those rare cases where the situation , a tricky one to surpass as it's been done ( the ' situation ' of pregnancy , not so much the one-nite-stand part ) , unfolds more as a story , and by the time the ' happy ' ending comes , it's not a cop-out or cheat . And this goes without saying that the actors , as well as the filmmaker , are totally assured with their comic skills , be they subtle ( the dazed look of the bearded " Martin Scorsese on cocaine " friend , even Rudd to a degree can be staggeringly subtle ) , or big ( the " second " sex scene between the main couple ) . Quite simply , it's THE rom-com sleeper of the past few years .
508355	453068	105151	10.0	the reality of the making of the un-reality of Hollywood	Once The Player's end credits rolled , I was shaken , but in the kind of way that you are when you hear a really sly , long joke by someone who knows what they're telling is not hysterical but still has a wicked knack that will stay with you or gnaw at your side . Robert Altman's the Player , one of his very best films ( maybe his best ) made since the 1970's , is as much about the detached , perfunctory nature of these characters as it is a story of a murdering writing executive . It's not a satire in the sense of Dr . Strangelove ; there's nothing that's over the top for the audience . But it does get in some notes , practically without any pretense of going about it otherwise , about the sterility of modern Hollywood . As a film buff , while watching this movie I'm not even bowled over by the numerous cameo appearances by Hollywood's main stars and wonderful character actors . That's because Altman , while being un-obtrusive of what the actors are doing on screen , has his focus set very carefully , and it's in this precise kind of mode that it works best . It's not to say Altman's style doesn't have its own voice , and some of the shots in the film - self conscious no doubt - bring out the anti-Hollywood while Hollywood ideas . And working in the framework , not the dependence , of the story lets some interesting things of reality go on . When you see this 8-minute long take at the start of the film , it's getting the music of the film going right away , of the ' money-talks , BS-continues ' attitude of a Hollywood studio , not just of the main character Griffin Mill ( Tim Robbins ) . It may be ' just a movie ' , but it's also one with this constant feel of life going on , as Altman , through Tokin's screenplay , is a fly on the wall as it were . We see Mill , a writing executive , go through a rough patch with a certain writer ( Vincent D'Onofrio ) who hasn't heard back from him in a while . When a harsh accident occurs , Mill has to keep moving , not just with his job or his details of the night the two had , but with the writer's girlfriend ( Greta Scacchi ) who start an affair . Altman once said , quite famously , once casting is complete 80 % of his work is done . The Player is one of those major examples in Altman's career , and despite the fact that most , if not all , of the supporting actors ( who may or may not also be in their cameo roles ) are sublime in their roles ( Goldberg , Scacchi , Lyle Lovett , and especially Cynthia Stevnenson ) , it's a key Robbins turn . His career has often had roles where he can lay in a naturalness that other actors might not have gone for . He also fits the role of Griffin Mill much as he did for Andy Dufresne and Dave in Mystic River . Here he has a perfect quality in this character to , as Ebert pointed out , not be un-likable even as he is not a good person . I loved the little facial gestures , the seemingly controlled stares , and the small moments where his upper class facade starts to wear down beneath the bloodless business of making movie deals . His could be for some the only reason to see the film , and rightfully so , as I really don't think Altman would've been able to pull it off with another . It does almost add to what could be frustration for some by the end of the film to see what happens to him , but it actually is after thinking about it more even more satisfying an ending . A question the film ponders for this character is - if he can survive the reality when all he wants is a happy ending in the stories he hears ? And through this simplicity some compositions and scenes are quite remarkable ; that one single shot of a certain close-up of a sex scene not only plays brilliantly off of a script description earlier , but is one of the best scene-shots I've seen in recent movies . Very well done , if not for everyone .
508177	453068	893382	10.0	aka : ' Some Country for Old Men '	Shine a Light displays , thrillingly and with the bombastic POP of a revisited ' happy place ' , why many love the Rolling Stones and many love the style of Martin Scorsese . It's mostly a concert movie shot over a period of two mights at the Beacon theater ( as if doing a workhorse revival of thirty years ago , while Scorsese was busy shooting New York , New York in 76 and doing the Last Waltz concurrently , this time he shot the concert while finishing up the Departed ) , with some choice documentary footage interspersed in between some songs . On both fronts , however minor the ( all archival ) interview footage is , it's a big success , visually and musically , as good old rock and roll performance art ( well , almost art , but I like it ) , and as visual virtuosity made incarnate . It might be easy to adulate the Stones , as well as Scorsese . They've been around for so long , doing what they do , with each side rumored here and there to quit doing what they do ( for the Stones it's every tour , much to their grinning bemusement , and for Scorsese it was a point in the 80s when he thought he'd have to leave Hollywood and make documentaries on saints ) . They're always acclaimed , usually big money-makers , and they've acquired a kind of nether-region between ' cult ' audience and full-blown mainstream mayhem . It's this that is , in a way , the subtext for Shine a Light . While Scorsese stays mostly behind the scenes , the Stones are up and front and in center of a marvelous performance , and showcasing the energy and level of pizazz that quiets the naysayers . They sold out , and it doesn't get to them a single bit . After some funny early footage of Scorsese ( shot usually in black and white DV by Albert Maysles , who also appears here and there ) getting into a minor tizzy about what the set-list is going to be , and getting some downtime with Bill Clinton , the show starts up like any good Stones show should - Jumpin ' Jack Flash . Then onward come some given numbers ( Shattered , Brown Sugar , Tumbling Dice ) , the masterpieces ( Sympathy for the Devil , Loving Cup , featuring an awesome Jack White , and Champagne and Reefer with an equally awesome Buddy Guy ) , and a lot of unexpected tracks too ( Live with Me with showy Aguilera , As Tears go By , some country song , and a kick-ass She Was Hot ) . For fans it's an amazing mix , and it allows for those who are just casual admirers to get their money's worth , primarily in IMAX . This is not just because of the quality of the music and the performances - which is , at its best , revelatory of what this band can do , at any age - but because of Scorsese's cameras , moving around in epic and roving fashion , edited with efficiency to not go all over the place or too slow , and , chiefly , to make it intimate like how many remember the Last Waltz to be ( lots of neatly defined close-ups , lingering on to capture these hardened rockers ) . And at the end , what is the point ? Is it just another blah-blah Stones concert movie ? Not necessarily . It doesn't have the heavy sociological context of Gimme Shelter , however it's not a little sloppy like Let's Spend the Night Together . Shine a Light celebrates its heroes , but it doesn't go completely overboard . Scorsese knows , as he did with Bob Dylan , not to get too cocky with these fogies . It's important to throw in those bits with the Stones getting interviewed , candid and without much overbearing ego present , and by the end you know there's still a place for them , firmly , in the public consciousness . They sold out in the most ironically good way in rock music history , with Scorsese now wonderfully in tow .
508139	453068	43953	10.0	even more classic than the Abbot & Costello " Who's on First " bit , works for all ages	One of the creme de la creme of the Looney Tunes cartoons ( almost overplayed when I was a kid , though never under-valued by me ) , Rabbit Fire is the cartoon that puts a different kind of edge on the cartoon form - it's funny , but almost in a satirical way . This is the kind of stuff that almost shouldn't be funny for kids , but more for adults ; if not for the randomness of it all , the banter might go over their heads completely . Although I always thought of this episode as one unto itself and not part of a " trilogy " as I have read , this is definitely the most popular of the three , as I remember practically every line by memory . Elmer is having his Jonesin ' for ' Hunting Wabbits ' , and gets perpetually mixed up as Bugs and Daffy have a back and forth over ' Duck season . . . rabbit season ' . There's one scene involving cross-character dressing that is the key gag in the short , and it always keeps me cracking up . The last moment , in a way , is kind of deep . Who knows what season it is for hunting anyone , anyway ? It's a little classic in the world of hand-drawn insanity , and one of only several times Daffy Duck has worked perfectly in a three-piece grouping .
510439	453068	118749	10.0	Odd , Funny and Touching	Boogie Night's has to be one of the funniest and oddest films I have seen in a long time . It is a homage to the pornography culture and to adults who will never grow up in California . The film also has brilliant acting , writing and camera work and is P . T . Anderson's best work yet . Some of the great stuff in this film is the acting which is some of the best of the decade . Including Burt Reynolds as the director Jack Horner ( this is his best piece of acting since the 70's ) , Julianne Moore as the struggling mother Amber Waves to the young actors and in a very good performance , and Mark Wahlberg in his best performance yet as the kid Dirk Diggler with something extra ( 13 inches to be exact ) that will make him a star . Also , the supporting cast is top notch and provides a lot of unintentional and sick comedy . But the real good stuff comes from the director Anderson . He gives us a look into a subject no one else has seen before ( or has wanted to see ) . The writing is funny and touching and the length gives the film time to sprawl into the masterpiece that it is . One of the best of 1997 .
510843	453068	1017495	10.0	one of the funniest new shows on prime-time ; it's charming and witty , and with enough ' quirk ' in dialog and style	Barry Sonnenfeld was the right director to helm the opening of Pushing Daisies , an original mystery / comedy yarn about a pie-maker named Ned ( Lee Pace ) who can bring a person back to life with a touch , but there's a catch , more than one , in scheme of things . It's also about a childhood friendship that went awry , and the mending of it years later as he redeems himself ( albeit , sadly , without the " emotional Heimlich maneuvers " let alone a kiss between the two , the girl ' Chuck ' played by Anna Friel ) . It's just the perfect kind of light and frothy texture , with visually vibrant exteriors and sets and production design ( the opening field reminds one of the field that Van Gogh painted once , to get all artsy ) . But at the same time it has a kind of stinging wit to it at times , where the actors know how silly this all is , but play it straight . It's not laugh-a-minute ala the Office or cynical like House , but it's got a ring to it that's just there . The " Umph " people talk about with certain projects is here right off the bat . Aside from the chemistry the stars have ( i . e . in the scene talking about the euphemism for hugs ) , as well as funny supporting work ( Chi McBride , who's always good for a ' what the hell ' look without straining himself , and Kristin Chenowith who's adorably odd ) , it's strangely fable-like even as it has its feet set firmly in the ground of the 21st century . And at the same time there's a structure set up to it : there will be crimes solved each week , as the dead ( hopefully in one minute's time ) will give their input on a certain huge decision in their lives , the end of such . It plays freely with the unexpected while set in a near storybook narrative ( Jim Dale's narrator veers into this being like some bedtime story spiked with existential mania ) . Now , it won't be for everyone ; it almost veers into being showy with its dialog , with the wit put on and on and the incidents so bizarre in their comedy ( i . e . ' there's a truck on fire , run gravediggers , come on out of that coffin honey ' ) . It's concept , to be sure , needs a big suspension of disbelief . Yet Pushing Daisies is one thing most network TV shows aren't : fresh in irony , strong in character , and extremely , unexpectedly funny . It also helps that , for a TV show , it's got terrific direction and visual POP to it . Can't wait for more episodes !
509583	453068	30341	10.0	A merry-go-round of a Hitchcock mystery , bordering brilliantly on a yarn	Alfred Hitchcock's 2nd to last British based film in the thirties is this classic little tale of a little old lady ( played in such sweetness by Dame May Whitty ) who disapears on a train . What makes this such an interesting story to unfold in the Hitchcok tradition is that is starts off as almost a comedy of manners . Margaret Lockwood , staying in an inn , is disturbed by an odd music playing and a clumping from her ceiling . Above her the manager finds clarinet player Michael Redgrave playing to a trio dancing around in a circle . Seeing this I laughed out loud , not remembering until the first murder that I was about to see a good old Hitchcokian story unfold . Possibly one of his best mysteries , this is a pleasure for his fans to behold .
510061	453068	52330	10.0	shows Tarkovsky's incredible control of direction for the most part ; surprisingly sharp Hemingway	Although I did like the 1946 adaptation of the Killers , I wasn't sure how a Russian , let alone someone who is usually much more into the visual prowess of things like Andrei Tarkovsky , would tackle Ernest Hemingway's brief , pulpy story of men on a mission and a man in hiding from those men . Turns out it's one of the best short films I've seen from a soon-to-be world renown European auteur , because of it's emphasis on the simplicity of suspense , of human action in desperate circumstances and how it's filmed with a mix of the noir style and with Tarkovsky's dependence on figures in curiously exciting compositions . He isn't alone on the film , however , as the middle scene at the apartment was directed by friend Alexander Gordon , with Tarkovsky directing the bigger chunks at the diner , and another guy Marika Beiku co-directing overall . Since the apartment scene is so short though , and accounts for just three shots , one being most elaborate as it goes in and out , tight and wide , on the morose Swede in hiding and his friend at the diner filling him in on what happened , it's mostly Tarkovsky's game here . Part of the skill , and curiosity , in how tense the long first scene at the diner is that music is completely absent , with the only tone coming from Tarkovsky himself as a whistling customer . Meanwhile , Tarkovsky uses Hemingway's dialog in a very realistic manner , even when he goes deliberate angles , like when George goes into the back with the sandwiches and we see his feet in the same tilted frame as an empty can on the floor , or with the usage of the mirror on the wall . There's also the suddenness of seeing a machine gun that strikes things up in the room , and just the general attitude of Al and Max , the hit men , as they keep calling George " bright boy " in a way that reminds me of the curious double-talk in a self-consciously bad-ass movie like Pulp Fiction ( not to mention the near casual usage of the ' N ' bomb ) . While it ends sort of on a screeching halt , the sense of ambiguity as to the fate of the Swede as well as everyone else in the diner who hid the secret is worthwhile for the material , as it's perfectly anti-climactic . It's not entirely a simple experiment , as it's too polished for that , but I couldn't see how it could be made any longer either . It's perfectly paced and acted nearly as well , and it's a fitting pre-cursor to the un-prolific but remarkable career of one of Russia's most important filmmakers .
510315	453068	83791	10.0	The beginning of the new and improved Muppets ; one of Henson-and-company's best	This sprawling , part-homage-part-totally original fantasy brings us Jen , the last of a group of near extinct creatures who is the only one who can save all existence by bringing a crystal shard back into the balance of the dark crystal , in order to save the world from the evil Skekses . This is quite an enthralling film , and like with the other full-on Muppet films this works on different levels for kids and for adults . Kids may be both scared and enthralled by the scope and details , not to mention the graphic nature of the darker elements portrayed ( as a kid I cringed a bit when the ' vital essence ' scenes came up ) . And for adults there's a lot of great craftsmanship that goes into the story , which is with all of the effects and over-the-top creations very well told by directors Henson and Oz . Without the massive usage of CGI or the more controlled visuals from the past fifteen or so years , the mix of the production design ( maybe some of the best ever in any fantasy film ) and the inventiveness put into the set-pieces and character-creations , is a knockout even by today's standards . It's almost a shame looking back on how a film like this that employs so many people and such time is now spent clicking away on a computer to get it all done . As it is , the Dark Crystal is one of those few examples in post-modern cinema that it does seem something like a sci-fi novel come to life .
510536	453068	841119	10.0	the best documentary you probably didn't see in 2007	In Lake of Fire , a film that Tony Kaye - director behind American History X ( which he wanted to be named under the pseudonym ' Humpty Dumpty ' following a loss of final cut ) - has been shooting footage for over fifteen years , is about all you need to see to know the fundamentalist and existentialist ramifications on the abortion-in-America issue . It covers all of the pro-life advocates , the murders of doctors and bombings of clinics , footage of actual abortions , and even an interview with the real-life ' Roe ' from Roe v . Wade . It covers about as much ground , in interviews and footage of those at rallies and on the street and so on and so forth , that can be covered in two and a half hours . But what builds up Kaye's film to such a potent focus is that Kaye doesn't let out necessarily what his stance is on the issue . I think this was the way to go , and not necessarily because it would be insensitive one way or the other - in order to take as objective a stance as possible ( which , in this case , is so next to impossible because of the subjective point for a woman when it comes time to decide on the pregnancy ) , it works best to let the sides speak for themselves . As it turns out , he doesn't let the pro-choice crowd be the only voices of reason either ; one actually sees , when there isn't total crazy Bible-thumping rhetoric , some sound arguments against abortion . And why not ? It's one of the murkiest of all issues in the annals of history , not just American . And as we learn painfully in Lake of Fire , no matter what the most savage and hypocritical of the maniacs who try and stop abortion practices and doctors ( in the old Malcolm X ' by any means necessary ' mold ) , women will always get abortions if it comes down to it . Kaye's scope is large and all encompassing , with interviews from the likes of pragmatic minded Noam Chomsky and Alan Dershwitz ( the latter's parable about the Rabbi hits it the nail on the head , if there could be a nail in this ) , to intelligent pro-lifer Nat Hentoff , to Roe ( real name Norma McCorvey ) who got converted to being pro-life after setting the stage for all of this in the 70s , to the clean-cut psycho Paul Hill . Then there's everyone in-between , from radio show hosts to priests and pastors ( one of which , an uproarious ' Lamb ' protector ) , and then to doctors and professors . Not one word is wasted , which is staggering unto itself for over two and a half hours . What one sees is the issue of choice in general , but also the nature of zealousness . To be sure , the pro-choice crowd are far less zealous than those who use the bible ( or the Pope or just any thoughts about heaven or hell in general and who they think will go to where or not ) as a blanket of protection . And Kaye's style for this is like that of mourning for lack of disagreeing to agree , and vice-versa and in-between . His cinematography shoots things in a stark , gray tone , while Anne Dudley's music - very akin to American History X - is that of the utmost tragedy . There are many beautifully shot scenes , from close-ups to cut-aways , but one that strikes me the most is during the Q & A at a doctor's office with a woman who is about to get an abortion . As far as the issue itself and how viewers will take to it . . . It's not cut and dry . It won't reveal to you anything that might change your opinion , if it's already steadfast , about the issue . What Kaye does do , and it's a brave feat , is to not candy-coat a thing , to be provocative but not to a point of no return , to make clear what is at stake in what it means for a human being to take a life , any life , and how we approach that . As a man I will never have to make that choice of ' do I or don't I ' in the first trimester . But as Lake of Fire makes perfectly clear , it's a civil rights issue through and through . It also makes for some fantastic cinema through someone as meticulous and exemplary a filmmaker as the ( unprolific ) Kaye .
509672	453068	95327	10.0	a combination of Rome Open City and Wiesel's Night ( and like both , an extreme , personally felt story )	In 1988 Grave of the Fireflies was placed on a double-bill alongside My Neighbor Totoro . Two of the most endearing films ever created - animated of otherwise - were paired alongside one another , more than likely to balance each other out ; after being submersed in a pure tale of innocence and delight like Miyazaki's great film , there could be accepted such a bleak , heartbreaking story of survival . And both films , incidentally , were based on true experiences , and while Miyazaki's story wasn't without some sadness in real life ( his mother was really sick with TB in the hospital ) , Akiyuki Nosaka's story is one drenched in the worst horrors imaginable for a child . It's basically about two siblings , an older brother and younger sister , who are left practically orphans in a Japan completely devastated by the constant barrage of bombs falling all around , and with very little hope in sight . This lays the groundwork for their relationship , a bond very fragile and incredibly endearing . Not since Rossellini and De Sica had a filmmaker , in this case Isao Takahata , touched a nerve so deeply etched out in deconstructing the horrors of wartime . By leaving us with these two characters , who piece by piece are stripped of their innocence in just the simple task of fending for themselves in a shelter ( they at first stay with an aunt who considers them freeloaders ) and scrounging for food any way possible , we're left with nothing else but their struggle , essentially . The backdrop itself almost becomes abstract , something so huge that we don't even know that it's Americans dropping the bombs , as it's already too much to grasp that a child's parent is no longer with them . Like Elie Wiesel's book Night , the backdrop and horror is used to pit these people in an untenable situation , and it can only end , honestly , without compromise . So , indeed , Grave of the Fireflies is bleak as hell , but compelling because it doesn't stray from its path with these characters , and that in many scenes we're connected to them without the overbearing heart-tugs of a common Disney feature ( though , ironically , as Ebert points out on an interview with the DVD , the big eyes in most anime is based upon those in early Disney films ) . The animation is exceptionally refined without being excessive in violence ; images are visceral for just what is briefly revealed , without the extraneous shots that one might see in a work not meant in a G-rated film ( i . e . when Seita sees her mother , dead and wrapped in bandages with the maggots and bugs crawling all over ) , and at the same time there's a sense of wonderment as the two children watch the fireflies in the shelter . The voice-work , too , doesn't strain credulity - these sound like , if it were a regular live-action feature , the kids who would play these parts ( and , speaking of neo-realism , the two credited for Seita and Setsuko never worked before or again ) . Most often , the film is heart-rending because of how things build with the situation . It's tragic enough to see the loss of the mother on the son , but then to hide it from the little girl becomes a greater challenge . Each time a layer of emotional defense is peeled back , it becomes harder not to connect strongly with these characters , such as when Seiko casually says she knows her mother is dead as she buries the fireflies and Seita finally cries out for the first time , or when Seita is left broken and humiliated after being beat up by the farmer for stealing food for sick Setsuko . And , finally , there's the last ten or so minutes , which I won't mention here . Suffice to say it's one of those times in movies where the opening of the film - Seiko dying homeless and famished - is explained to a perfect degree by film's end . It's a harrowing experience , and one of the very best animated films .
509158	453068	56732	10.0	still one of the top comedies about utter frustration	The Exterminating Angel , what a movie - I've seen it twice now and each time it went against ( in the best possible way ) my better logic . It's a work that's the product of a kind of madman place , and it stays impressive forty plus years later due to its humor . Like Dr . Strangelove , or maybe more so akin to a Kafka work submerged in Catholic plague , the film subverts expectations . At the start of the film , Luis Bunuel makes it clear as day that his only explanation is that its nonsense . If one were wanting to dig on a pure comedy level it would work because the dialog is so strange and out of place ( if taken seriously ) but consistently so , and the timing of the sort of downward spiral that plunges into the denouement ( if there is one ) . If one were wanting to look at it for more of the technical reasons , its peerless - Bunuel has a steady , carefully controlled camera , quite tradition at times . But then at others he reveals his revealing , awesome flashes of symbolism , which may or may not fly over some viewers heads . And then , if one were to go so far , on an existential level it goes into the realm of nothingness , a kind of study of how a nonsensical existence , trapped for reasons not made clear to the viewer ( barely to the rich cast of bourgeois , a running gag almost ) , which also calls in the Kafka aspect . By the hand of a surrealist comes a deadpan satire , and it almost becomes a dark fable ( the Catholic aspect to the film ) by the end . It's a rather shocking film on the first try , which is why it probably had some controversy when it first opened . Giving it another chance , the film works better , on a more sensory level almost . This is the kind of film where you're either scratching your head and turning it off midway through , or laughing ( while in the grips of cringing perhaps ) and in a weird awe . One of Bunuel's very best Mexican films .
510219	453068	64612	10.0	an excellent look at morality in relationships , or what is perceived as morality	My Night at Maud's is a " talky " film , though like the main character of Jean-Louis in going after the woman to marry this actually is a perception that is on face-value a little demeaning . This is such a rich screenplay because it takes its characters seriously and honestly , and there's nothing cheating in dealing with characters who have problems in confronting how to approach emotional contact , of using religion as a guise , or trying to follow a ' code of conduct ' ( as one French critic called it on the Criterion DVD of the film ) that leads into a complex and troubling end . Even more-so than Love in the Afternoon , this is a work where the male perspective must have the counterpoint of a woman who is much more vibrant and life-affirming by not being connected to a kind of constricting religious ideology that can't really lead to anywhere aside from compromise . Jean-Louis is such a man who sees blonde Francoise ( Stardust Memories ' Barrault ) riding on a motorcycle and decides right then that she will be the one he will marry . His is an idealized love where despite saying that he's been in love and relationships before he has not had to really make a leap into a consequential decision . The philosophical arguments involved with Jean-Louis , Francoise and even with Maud , of whom Jean-Louis has a pensive and indecisive fling over the course of 24 hours , can last for quite a while after film's end , which is a major credit to Rohmer in making these characters real within the specific contexts . They may be bourgeois , or close to it , but the concerns of the characters are universal : How does one make a leap from emotional experience to belief . Or on the flip-side how does one who probably doesn't have any belief either way ( watch Francoise's eyes when she goes with Jean-Louis to church , it's an exceptionally subtly acted scene ) and has to fall into a kind of false love , where because she already knows of the image that Jean-Louis already has of her before she says a word that she has to continue it , marry him , have a child , and live with his own moral insecurities ? The ending may seem clean-cut , but it's a lot more complex as a sort of continuing cycle . Marriages are formed and bonds made between people all the time when there is no love , but what might be a reason ? This isn't Rohmer's central point perhaps , but it's an intelligent posit that is right there in Rohmer's character study . And all the while , through Rohmer's simple direction - the only big stylistic choice , perhaps important in the Bergman sense , is the use of the landscape of winter and the mainstream conformity of Christmas - he gets great performances from his actors , as if in a play all working towards the cores of the character in order that all of the at-times heavy dialog comes off in a fairly approachable light . Rarely will you get Pascal and romance thrown together into a conversation , but it works in this case , and for someone who's only known Pascal from a triangle it's enlightening to see how moral choice , of probability and chance , come out in ways that leap from one place to another but always coherently in the scenes at Maud's apartment . There's a good deal under the surface that comes out little by little , and if one can give in to the rhythm of Rohmer's characters the rewards are just as satisfying as with other more flamboyant works by Rohmer's contemporaries . It may not be Jules and Jim , but in its own disquieting way it's just as powerful in the implications drawn from the characters , particularly long after the film ends .
508232	453068	53221	10.0	not one of my top five favorite westerns , but it is a damn entertaining classic western	There's almost a kind of bridge between the westerns of old and the sort of last legs of the western in this film - it has the good ol ' sensibilities of the classics ( loyalty , honor , the power of the sheriff , the quirkiness and durability of the ones around him , shoot-outs ) , while also giving some room for some more modern ones ( Dean Martin as ' Dude ' , Angie Dickinson as ' feathers ' , and the overall excitement ) . It has a song at one point ( obviously for one its stars , the late Ricky Nelson , a popular singer at the time ) . It has the crotchety , funny old man ( Walter Brennan as Stumpy , one of his best roles ) . And , of course , the ' Duke ' John Wayne , who has his usual swagger and qualities that make him a prime figure of the ' male ' in films . This time though , he does have some of his tough exterior shed away a little , maybe . Howard Hawks , if nothing else , is most powerful as a storyteller , doing almost nothing with the style of his camera to be creative except to shoot these people , going through the motions . The story , which later was used as a basis for John Carpeneter's Assault on Precinct 13 , has Wayne as the Sheriff and Dean Martin as his on and off again drunken deputy ' Dude ' , who have to look after a criminal in their jail , as he has a brother with a gang who are plotting to break him out . As the Sheriff , or Chance as he's called , has to deal with this , he also has the woman , and the old man , and Dude ( Martin is great in the film , maybe the best male performance of the lot ) , not to mention the hot-to-trot young gunslinger played by Nelson . In all , it's the kind of genre film that should be taken seriously on one hand , but on the other , its meant to be a rollicking good time through the less tense and exciting parts ( and there are quite a few from a director who once said that ' there's no action without danger ) . It lacks a kind of urgency that some of Hawks ' other films have , and occasionally Wayne is a little too much " The Duke " to see if he's really giving a well-rounded performance as the sheriff . But besides that , it makes for some very memorable moments , a slick ending , and some endearing performances . It's also a film that takes its characters to heart as much as its story ; a credit to screenwriters Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett ( the later one of my favorites of the period ) . Not quite a masterpiece , but its definitely worth watching at least once if you're getting into the genre .
510990	453068	60891	10.0	the feminine control factory of 18th century and beyond	The Nun might be just another very good , possibly excellent and heartbreaking piece of " religion is rotten and the people in it control people in terrible and soul-crushing ways " movie-making akin to Carl Dreyer if not for its last third or maybe second half ( it's something of that length ) . For a good while Jacques Rivette's film from the book by Denis Diderot is about Suzanne ( Anna Karina ) , a young woman who is passed along from her parents , one the mother wanting to go to the afterlife " clean " without the burden of her sin which was connected to Suzanne's father not really being her father , to a convent and forced to say she will be celibate and devout and all that jazz . Jazz as in life as a nun , forced to say that she believes wholly in God and will deny herself everything in order to serve him - when he calls or feels like it of course . In this first half or so the film is about as close as one can get outside of Carl Dreyer to it being about the pain inflicted upon an innocent in a world dominated by a ) a natural prejudice towards women , in this case to go completely rigidly by the rules - or , b ) for that matter , a hell placed upon those who dont want to be nuns and just want to experience something else in the world . We see Suzanne subjected to this convent at first run by a helpful and loving Mother Superior Mme de Moni only to die and her replacement be so hard-pressed as to eventually see Suzanne as being possessed by a devil , keeping her away from the other nuns , locked up without food or water , or any legal counsel . This part seems straightforward as does the eventual Priests - find - out - Mme - is - unrelenting - and - transfer - her story progression . . . but something very fascinating happens , something that makes The Nun from what is already a heart-rending and tasteful story of repression and super 18th century Christian fervor into a great film . The second convent , on first appearance , is total bliss compared to the former one . Suzanne is treated to happy nuns , a happy Mother Superior Simonin , and even some lighthearted revelry like playing games outside , something that would have never happened at the previous convent . But there's also an underlying uneasiness that is confirmed by the Mother Superior being , how should I say , " clingy " to at first Suzanne's story and then Suzanne herself . It's not just enough for Rivette , by way of the book , to show religion being domineering and cruel and at best complacent in the expected sense , but for another look at what should be religious organization run by caring and spiritual people to be also total kooks . It's like Rivette puts down this section of some fun like the slightest of reprieves and then to bring it back under the rug , and it's something really special to see . It's a bleak story not simply because a woman who has no rightful place in a convent of nuns is forced into it and made into another cog in the religious machine , but for the lack of hope conveyed in what good there is , the goodness of people devoted to a life of faith , that is revealed . It's an incredibly precise indictment on organized religion and society that allows how it runs as much as captivating morality drama . The Nun can also be read as a searing feminist statement , but going into this part might make this too long a review . Suffice to say The Nun , a controversial film ( at the time ) made from a controversial book of its time , conveys what it wants to say in stark locations and even starker performances from the supporting cast . The two actresses playing the significant Mother Superiors in the story deserve credit , yet the main reason to see the picture is for Anna Karina . She makes a sense of purpose in every scene , a performance that is startling for it being so removed from ex-husband Godard's usual self-conscious comedy / dramas and into something that requires her to plunge the depths of whatever she can handle emotionally for the character . It turns out to be the best serious performance of her's I've seen to date outside of maybe Vivre sa vie . Suzanne , thanks to Karina , is so sad a character , so right in her common sense and driven almost mad by this rigid and monstrous Christian dogma that you cant take your eyes off her for a second . It's rare to see a performance this tender and selfless to the dark and light in human being .
508779	453068	1227926	10.0	possibly the single funniest thing I've seen from Whedon . . .	. . . I say this though as a quasi-Whedon ignorant ; I've only seen about two seasons worth of Buffy , no Angel , and all of Firefly and Serenity . Joss Whedon's sense of humor is playful , crude , warped , and everything one might love from a skewering of superheroes . Hancock , take note , this is how it's done with consistency ! The premise of Dr . Horrible can be summed up in one sentence : Boy ( Dr . Horrible ) with nerdy powers finds and wants girl , boy loses girl to arch nemesis boy Captain Hammer , boy plots revenge , boy finds things end on a pretty bitter and sad note . Or , to put it another way , it's about the nerdy guy wanting the girl and the beefy upstart with an ego the size of a blimp is hogging her for himself . That's the gist of it , anyway , but to say this is all Dr . Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is about is to do a total disservice to Whedon and his large fan-base . This is a musical not quite unlike the Buffy classic " Once More , with Feeling " only without that pesky ' you have to know a and b and c are going on in the series and season ' logic . One is thrust into that sharp , laconic , and joyously obvious sense of humor that reveals Whedon as someone who is a kind of curious master of musical comedy with those appropriate doses of barbed satire . At the same time , as one who may have watched their share of Buffy and even Firefly knows , Whedon is also a hopeless romantic ( hopeless in that he can't seem to put people together without something going wrong , which is the point of all drama one supposes ) , and his tale of Dr . Horrible , done through songs that reveal the characters ' souls , heartfelt and adorable and totally meat-headed ( the Captain's final song at the podium with his award is next to Godliness ) , and at the same time a cheap joke ( random cowboys singing along from the sides of the frame ) or a catchy number ( the " Man's gotta do " song is far more wondrous than about 99 . 9 % of stuff on the radio now ) isn't sacrificed for the sake of what little plot there is . And lest not forget the acting , or at least the awesome musical prowess . Neal Patrick Harris and Nathan Filion are just about perfect in their roles , as is the woman who plays Penny ( the red-headed girl Dr . Horrible meets at the Coin Mart ) , with Filion especially juicy in a somewhat campy turn where he takes all those heroic qualities of his Firefly character and reveals the dark side ( " And yes , we had sex " ) . Dr . Horrible's Sing-along Blog is about as close to romantic - comedy - musical - satire amazement as one could hope for , or maybe not expect , from Whedon , particularly as a free web-series running just about the length of a full short film ( or an extremely short feature ) .
510382	453068	64873	10.0	one of the sleepers of the late sixties , with ( good ) experimental ideals for a drama	In some scenes in the Rain People , Francis Ford Coppola's precursor to his hey-day of the seventies , there is the mark of a similar situation to 1969's Easy Rider , but not exactly in the same reference frame . Here we have a drama about disconnected people from society , in some ways alienated by the choices or by limits imposed by one mean or another . It's one of those rare original dramas where some scenes stand alone as total knockouts . Even with such a low-string budget and a very freewheeling , so to speak , attitude about filming the movie , Coppola is able to capture everything that needs to be said through these clearly defined characters and the curved , unexpected degrees of one character versus the helplessness of another , or vice versa , or both . And , as one might be inclined seeing as how it is very much about the cutaways of suburban life of the 1960s , it has that escapism of the film mentioned before , but of a more concrete , near timeless quality with the drama and the underlying issues . In a way , if Bergman were on route as a quasi-guerrilla 20-something filmmaker out to get the strange truths of everyday outsiders , this might be it . But along with all of the very direct and sometimes self-conscious photography ( though also with a more documentary approach at times , akin with its indeterminable characters ) , the actors all fit into place . Shirley Knight , an actress I'm not too familiar with , has a complex , diverging role as a pregnant wife running off in a sort of existentialist conundrum of what life is there to have . There are moments of some awe-inspiring acting by her , and one of my favorites ( if not my favorite ) is when she is on the telephone calling her husband the first time . Such a tense scene on both ends , and in every small gesture and inflection of a word so much about her is spoken with so little . It's extraordinary in ways that mirror others in Coppola's films . Then comes in the character of ' killer ' played by James Caan . This , too , is a dangerous character to take on , as it is a mix of childish bewilderment and amusement with scarred memories . Think Forrest Gump if he didn't make it past the football and wit . It's one of his best , actually , by being the most minimalist - for a guy who's usually playing tough guys in movies , here's one that also is part of the crux of the story and of Knight's character . Also very good in a supporting role is Robert Duvall as a cop with a rough side and rather checkered past ; kind of an early sample of other defected characters he would play later on in his career . So the characters , and what Coppola risks in having an uneasiness running in them , are really what make up the film , as whatever story there is it is definitely not resolved in the usual way you might think or expect . The last ten or so minutes are like others in Coppola's work , where the specific tragedies on all sides are undercut by the emotional - and psychological - implications this will leave on the principles are amplified to the sublime and sad . This is , for its time , brave on the part of what is trying to be represented ( in both the freedom as well as the flaws and ambiguities ) in the subject matter . And the style of the picture adds a fragmented kind of view onto it all with quick flashbacks that are graphic and self-contained in a contrast with the longer shots in some crucial scenes . It's a road movie of its period , but its also got a lot more working than it would under another filmmaker with less chances to take on the nature of these outcast characters . One of the best films of 1969 .
507872	453068	78480	10.0	just about a masterpiece of animation ; Rosen is a brilliant British filmmaker	Watership Down is that animated film you'll hear about from a friend - not usually when you're a kid unless you're the kind that hangs around those reading dark British animal novels written by Richard Adams - when you're an older teen or an adult , and that it's not you're garden-variety Disney movie with violent rabbit encounters and an animation approach that is not at all " fluffy " in description . When finally seen , it goes past the hype of being one of those sleeper hits of the 1970s . It's mostly a pure masterpiece of animation , British or otherwise , though for Britain it's an even more significant achievement if only because only a handful of movies made there have made it to the States ( not counting Rankin / Bass stuff like the Hobbit , more like the 1950s Animal Farm adaptation ) . The approach from writer / director / producer Martin Rosen recognizes the source material as something very special ; it's very much like one of those memorable books translated to screen without compromise that speaks to either very sophisticated older kids or to open-minded adults . It's not a fun romp , but rather a drama about society broken down to pieces and the contention between those that want to break from the old ways and destruction from human hands and those that still c ling to the ways of the ' General ' character . It's also not for those not ready for a sad story ; while it doesn't quite end on a sad note ( maybe more bittersweet with a touch of the spiritual in a sense ) , there's lots of struggle and adversity to face , and it even faces questions that probably mean more coming out of an English mind-set regarding the breaking out of the old guard in times of survival . Basically , it's about two rabbits , Hazel and Fiver , who lead a group of rabbits from their old homestead to a place that will be safe from destruction . And it's a good idea as all the old burrows and tunnels are plugged up . But there's contention in the ranks from the ' General ' , who demands that everything stay the same . Thanks to rabbits like Bigwig though things move ahead , but there's a lot of obstacles along the way . This is the clothesline of the plot , and there are a lot of details that should feel like they're apart of a more conventional animated movie even out of Disney . And yet , with Rosen's direction and the work of the animators , it's by a different impulse and mood , the film has the look of a real artistic drive - colors are usually ( with a couple of exceptions like with that odd sun ) very naturalistic , as most of the rabbits are , and because of this there's something going on one doesn't usually see in animated talking animal movies : a sense of the world presented as realistically ( or at least honestly ) as possible , and then pulsating with humanistic qualities through the characters and their journey . As I mentioned , it's not really for little kids . If only because some of them will just be confused at times or not understand why the rabbits aren't like the really cute ones of other storybooks and fantasies ( or , actually , just parts of the storyline and really well written dialog ) , but also because of the violence - the kind of which that could've inspired the PG-13 rating system back in the day . This goes without saying occasionally Rosen tries to put in some things that could make it more family friendly , and these end up being the only liabilities of the movie , notably , for me , the Art Garfunkel song put into a scene midway through ( not to say too much but it involves a ghost ) that feels sappy as bad syrup . When Rosen sticks to his guns and makes it a solid , unflinching story of rabbits out for survival in not-so-merry old England , it's exceptional , and surely one of the best films of the late 70s .
508728	453068	106179	10.0	even in its lulls , this was one of the best shows on prime-time TV	The X-Files was , regrettably , not a show I was die-hard about when it was airing week after week in my youth / teen years . I would catch an episode here and there , be entertained , but also think ' this episode isn't TOO much different from the other ones ' . The film that came out as the spin-off of the series did spark my interest more , however , as having a full arc even for someone as just a casual fan . Then as the series went in its latter days , I did tune out ( thinking , ' why's Robert Patrick on the show , all this Scully baby-drama , etc ' ) . However , as the show now goes on in syndication on the various cable channels , and I have refreshed my awareness of the first season as quasi-background , I've become rather addicted ( minus the Patrick episodes , the lulls mentioned earlier ) . Sometimes what draws me in is the occasional , unexpected morbid humor . But mostly its in how the stories on the show , while of course sticking close to being ' TV ' , are the more engrossing the more you know about the characters . And there are some very inventive episodes regarding the unexplained , the bizarre human characters , and of course the UFO's and other assorted visitor folk . While I'm not as immersed in the show yet as with shows I've been watching since a youth ( Seinfeld , Simpsons , South Park , Daily Show ) , part of the fun of getting further and further into the episodes is seeing the comparisons , of what's gotten better or worse , more intriguing or less . Much like the inspiration of the show - All the President's Men - the more you see of what can't be explained , the more you can't stop finding the truth . Hokey at times , sure , but also a cult-delight .
508742	453068	421460	10.0	can't say much about the original talk soup , but this ' new ' version is great brain candy	The Soup has become one of those nifty little pleasures of cable TV for me recently . To say that it's a guilty pleasure might be a little hard to say , as it is basically just a summary of all of the weird , crazy , delirious , whatever-you-call-it , and plain bad and near offensive TV of the past week . So to say it's a guilty pleasure would mean that it's sort of wrong on a level to watch the show , hard to admit . But the whole program is like a full-on pop culture version with a little more goofiness of what the Daily Show does in its first eight or nine minutes of reviewing clips . It's satire , though of a fairly low denomination where very cheap graphics , sometimes lame jokes , and lots of tongue placed in as many firm cheeks as possible end up squeezing out jokes . It's hosted by Joel McHale in a very smarmy , sarcastic manner , but he makes it work for what it's worth , and one becomes sort of adjusted to what his shtick is after a while . Ironically , McHale has his work cut out for him , because the clips are sometimes very funny on their own , without really a word or gesture or gag to add to it . Reality Show clip-time , Chat Stew ( " so meaty " ) , What the Kids Are Watching , and Clip of the Week are among the regulars , and in this dire swamp of pop culture and other TV - sometimes stretching to international lengths with Spanish soap operas and inexplicable Japanese shows - is never-ending . If anything as time goes on , there's almost too much to choose from . There are new categories created each week by McHale and his writers , two of them being funny by themselves in just having no other choice but to make fun of where the Soup itself broadcasts from - the E network ( Lets Take Some E ! is one new segment , as well as a whole list of those un-Godly tabloid TV shows like E . T . and Access Hollywood ) . It's basically a fun way to spend half an hour on a Friday night or Saturday morning , and as someone who doesn't really watch much TV and tries , sometimes without success , to avoid bad TV even when it's ironically good or horrific celebrities and people on reality shows I shouldn't give a damn about , it's a great little treat .
508249	453068	86979	10.0	WOW	I saw this film for the first time tonight and even though it is a re-release from the original 1984 feature and not new , I found it to be one of the best films I've seen his year . It is ingeniously done by It's actors and It's first time film-makers , Joel and Ethan Coen who bring such a disturbing film it makes Fargo look like Carebears . And keep in mind I walked into this film without no knowledge of the story or characters , so that ( and the people working on the film ) made it entertaining . The story is very complicated , but it involves a wife ( Frances McDormand in a comanding first role ) who is cheating on her husband's ( Dan Hedaya is very good ) bar worker ( John Getz ) . So , Hedaya gets a sleazy hitman guy ( M . Emmet Walsh ) to kill her wife and his lover . But then it gets pretty messed up after that , and even though it takes place in Texas , it isn't a Chainsaw Massacre . But , don't also be expecting a film that is cuddly also . The picture is helped along the way not only by It's acting , writing and direction , but also by It's cinematography by now director Barry Sonnenfeld , who brings in a almost personality to the camera ( like in the Coen's Raizing Arizona ) and makes this film that much better . Definately a must see , especially for film-noir fans .
508509	453068	51554	10.0	not sure if it's the most absolute " faithful " Dracula adaptation , but it's my favorite	Has there even been in the history of British horror such a clash of the titans ? Peter Cushing , a man who has super-high cheekbones ( more-so as he grows older , see : Star Wars ) and a face stern enough to scare schoolchildren silly , and Christopher Lee , a man who is somehow able to combine the everlasting creepyness of the Bela Lugosi Dracula with that of the somewhat charming and seductive Dracula of 1979's Frank Langella , only have their big title bout at the end of the picture as the classic villain / hero Dracula / Van Helsing face-off . It's well worth the wait , as the director , Terence Young , aided by a group of skilled and consummate professional craftsmen make what is not just a great Hammer movie but a great movie period . This is what one wants in a Dracula movie all-around . It might have some bright lighting in some scenes ( indeed the British aren't always fans of shadows or anything experimental when it comes to simple talking scenes ) , and as he one very minor liability Lee isn't quite in it as much as one might hope for ( his appearances are limited , but this may also be due to the short running time ) , but this is what essentially is the Bram Stoker myth made into hard-edged and occasionally very funny flesh and cinema . It's one thing that the script has no fat on its bones and makes us care about the characters with limited exposition . If anything it resembles a true-blue B-movie more-so the big-budget studio production . But it's another that the performers , all more or less classic British pros , make it so worthwhile . It's almost inarguable that Peter Cushing and Lee deliver two of their key performances in their careers . For Cushing he gets to deliver line after line with the kind of conviction and earnestness that would make other actors crap themselves , and he even casts a kind of bad-ass mold once or twice . For Lee his dialog is limited , which is just about perfect for him : we might not get a " I don't drink . . . wine " line , but we don't need it for this story . Dracula's presence is enough , and on that count Lee's performance is something of a minor miracle . Every actor ever playing Dracula must look at him in this movie , there's no getting around it . Matter of fact , anyone wanting to get another peek at how Dracula can be done with style and class and real chills and spills ( and , oddly enough , tasteful and fun for the kids ) , must look here . Period .
508593	453068	67085	10.0	still the most experimental film Herzog ever made ; pretentious nonsense or close to slowly riveting poetry , you be the judge	It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about . Or , maybe it isn't : Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to film assorted landscapes and the locals . But this is just the broadest stroke . It's a feat that you either surrender yourself to , or you don't . He gets into the form of the world around him entirely , without a story , bound only to certain aspects of written poetry , as his camera ( shooting on supposedly discarded film stock ) wanders like in a pure travelogue . One might even jump to that easy conclusion , as he puts up these immense landscapes , then moving to more rough civilized culture ( though not the actual ' normal ' culture itself ) , and to a point levels too abstract to be able to convey properly here . Sometimes it takes a while to get along , close to a purity through the " creation " section , but a purity in how parts are manipulated either by nature or by broken-down machines . Soon the narration , readings from the Popol Vuh ( who , by the way , does the music for most of his films ) , with the gradual procession of actually highly stylized shots adds a whole different level to it . It's a hybrid film , and it's not easy , but the rewards are what best comes closest to Herzog's idea of " ecstatic truth " , images he's been out for his whole career . One wonders if the images end up , by the time the second section , Paradise , leading along the words spoken , or if it's the other way around . You're eyes are moving along with the stills and pans , and the wording is close to being religious writing , but there's also the music choices , how the bizarrely spare singing and low-key classical music goes together with Leonard Cohen and Blind Faith . I think each side ends up complimenting the other , and it's something that still seems like it shouldn't work . Perhaps that's the draw to it , the chances taken in going through desolate wastelands and the smallest run sections of any kind of civilized life ( in this case the shacks of the desert ) , that make it so fascinating . If only for the cinematographic sense it's a marvel , too indescribable for the casual photography fan because of molds of technique , and some of the strangest images of any Herzog film . There's pans , there's long-shots , there's hand-held while driving by the towns , there's a bus dozens of miles away that via mirage seems only a couple , there's full-on close-ups of fire and a man holding a reptile and talking about its radar ( truly classic gonzo comedy ) , there's people holding still in fake poses , and a man and woman playing inane music . But , most importantly , it ends up feeling , at least for me , natural for the personal nature of the approach . I'm sure only Herzog would know for certain why he made this film , as opposed to the simple ' how ' ; he was already filming Even Dwarfs Started Small , and he ended up going through many perils to finish it . Yet this is what makes Fata Morgana such an amazing feat - it will appeal to one depending on what someone brings to it in actually watching it . It's definitely unsettling , but there's the temptation to want to see it again very soon after , just to experience all of the ideas and realities turned abstracted strange vibes ( yes , the word ' vibes ' applies here ) . It's one of the truly spectacular " art-films " ever made .
508656	453068	71562	10.0	One of the best sequels ever made	The Godfather part 2 gets very close to the title for best sequel ever made , but not quite . Even so , I would rank this among the superior films to follow up on another and still be as strong and appealing and dramatically satisfying as the former . The structure of the film is also very important as it jumps back and forth between two stories of Corleone's without any disconnected feelings for the audience . Both could work as perfect single films on their own ; together it's like a double album of the dark side of crime and the perilous nature of rising up in America as an immigrant . It's spectacular in many ways , masterpiece in fact , and has become as important as the first one ( it is the only sequel to win an Oscar for best picture in those terms ) and the acting all around is well-knit ( even the pioneer himself Lee Strasberg is on hand as Roth ) , the score is possibly better in some ways to the first film , and most of the scene work is fantastic . One thing that attracted me to this film is also what I believe is one of the all-time great breakthrough performances in any film , as Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone has all of that confidence as an actor without channeling too much Brando . If there would be one reason to see the film and recommend it it would be because of him , as he gives one of his tour de force career turns in that streak of one after another in the 70s . Pacino is practically as good with enough lines that are realistically grounded but also highly quotable at times ( the " in my home " bit is priceless ) . John Cazale , by the way , is also an element to make the film work as one of two performances that he'll be remembered for twenty years down the line ( the other being Dog Day Afternoon ) . In short , it's just a very well done picture .
510876	453068	74958	10.0	Not just the sharp-as-a-tack dialog , but the key performances and the look of the film are enduring	This is one of those works that is emblematic of what can be done with a director who knows his craft and chooses a style that is both controlled and not controlling , a writer who can let out some wild scenes and incredible exposition and make it practically believable ( maybe more so today ) , and a cast that understand their creative forces at work . After seeing the film I was actually struck just as much , for example , by William Holden's performance as I was by Peter Finch , though the latter usually gets most of the credit ( and rightfully so , in an Oscar-winning turn beating out De Niro in Taxi Driver if one can believe that ) . But then one has to take into account their different levels of skill in their performances , and how they both deliver even more than what is required . Holden , for me , is just as good here as he is in his best work ( Sunset Blvd , The Wild Bunch ) , but in the role of the worn-out , dedicated professional who in his own way has had about as enough bs that can be taken as the main character . Yet Holden also knows his performance needs to be more reserved , and as his story gets more complicated he has to make some subtle choices as perhaps the only really sane person in the film . His work here is accomplished in the style of one sense , while Finch , who plays a character going back and forth between being totally nuts and knowing more than anyone else out there in TV land , takes his role with a heedless abandon . In short , this is one of the more fearless looks at the media ever presented on film , and it's even more relevant today perhaps than when it was first released . It's sad that not only did Lumet and Paddy Chayevsky think that what they were doing ( aside from the ending ) was all true , but that as the decades have passed since Regan's to-do with changing the rules of journalism , it's gotten worse . It was actually kind of shocking to see one or two of the revelations from Finch in some scenes , and the connection made in the 3rd act with Saudi Arabia is one of my favorite parts of the film ( particularly the speech by Ned Beatty in one of the all-time great one-scene roles ) . News , basically , now is like everything else on TV , where you get what you pay for via the advertising , but not as it should really be with the news as it is . Howard Beale , basically , is like one of those ultra-symbollic ( but relatable ) characters in movies , in a demented way like Stewart in Mr . Smith Goes to Washington , where the truth has to be spoken by someone , but who in America will listen ( or , ironically , who won't if it's shelled out right in front of the cameras ) . In other words , this is one of those films that does ask a viewer to think about what is being shown - an ' informed ' public ( which is growing less and less as the media becomes smaller and more controlled via government and regulations ) - while still providing acting that sticks and lines of dialog that are among the best in 70's films . Faye Dunaway is the female counterpart to her older male stars and is just as good , being like a very cold , typical businesswoman who only makes things feel like she does , as if something was lost in youth . Duvall is also good here , if maybe not at his very best , in a role as a TV exec . But there are bit parts that are really good too , like the black female militant member who complains at a meeting about the grosses of showing footage on TV . And in a small way , like the films of Brooks and Monty Python , Lumet understands how to film things very realistically ( though the style appropriately changed from start to finish ) so that the satire within can spring out . Even an over-the-top scene like Beale's first Mad-as-Hell speech works on this level . Overall , this is a really amazing film , with enoughs scathing , dark material mixed with the truth that should and isn't presented to those who rely solely on programming . " Because you're on television , dummy " are the last words Beatty says to Beale in their scene after Beale asks " why me ? " By the end , as the film reaches its ultimate climax , one might wonder if his question is relatable to all TV , not just the news . Why is it what you say to people through this abstract medium important , or not ? The answers , looking at how the news is run now , should be obvious . Maybe Lumet's best outside of his more ' urban ' films ( i . e . Serpico , The Pawnbroker , Dog Day Afternoon ) .
508103	453068	60028	10.0	where no TV shows have gone before ! ( always wanted a log-line like that )	Star Trek is one of the true zeitgeists of TV history , a show that is about as unlikely to be popular as imaginable , but it caught on to the audience eventually , and today , half a dozen more series ( not counting the animated Star Trek TOS ) , ten or so movies , and a mind-boggling number of Trekkie conventions , have come out of its wake . To be honest , I'm not a usual " Trekkie " - I'd probably turn down an offer to go check out a convention , or pose questions about episode 2 . 5 and what cre # 5 wore on the planet next to blah-blah . But even when the show gets corny - and it gets corny and cheesy and reveling-low-budget often - it attempts to surpasses things that make it melodrama into the realm of smart science fiction . It's rousing action and daring-dos , and it also probes in questioning form here and there the nature of the universe , of man in conquest , dominance , subversion , submission , mind-melds , monsters , Platonians , ships-that-are-she's , evil goatees , and so on and so forth . I know , I sound like I'm not taking the show seriously . But as a piece of pop entertainment it can be as absorbing as anything that was produced in the period or since . Through the cheap sets and the very " plastic " special effects , and even through William Shatner , who can ham-bone at times like it's some kind of manic art-form ( just watch the last episode of the series - before it was canceled - as Kirk's soul is taken over by a jealous ex-lover in hysterics , or the " ship-called-she " episode ) , it has good storytelling , and strong ideas expressed from time to time . One can't admire the episode when McCoy goes nuts and gets transported back to depression era America , and the hand of fate falls down hard on Kirk and Spock . Or the much heralded classic first featuring Ricardo Montebaum , who has just as much sneaky charisma as in the movie ( minus the fake chest ) . Or when Sulu suddenly went all Errol Flynn in a manic state . Or even . . . well , this could go on a while . Suffice to say Roddenberry had it right : get some good writers , make things always punchy with dialog and situations of peril and the most asinine moments become enthralling TV . And , in a strange way , the original series carries a pathos with it , a charming quality with the stories and the characters , as well as some creative uses of mind control and the misuses of power , by the enemy or those on the Enterprise , that might be a little absent in the other series . While the acting quota might have been higher with Picard and the others , Kirk , Spock , and McCoy and all the others allow their stars to fill their shoes proudly , with many scenes that end up surprising those that expect the same shtick every episode ( Nimoy crying , or singing , is enough to give belly laughs for about a week ) . In retrospect , it might be difficult to differentiate how much of the show works as legitimate science fiction theater and how much of it is fun cause of the ' so-bad-it's-good ' quality that has it just a notch above most MST3K movies . But Roddenberry and the Star Trek crew straddle that line wonderfully , allowing moments of guilty pleasure and real delight in a series that worked , in its - ish episode run , consistently . It's the kind of show that you may start watching on TV a few minutes after it starts , and it sucks you in , as if in some Vulcan mind-meld .
509837	453068	824747	10.0	Clint's best since Mystic River , and a harrowing performance from its star .	I saw Clint Eastwood recently on the Daily Show , and Jon Stewart brought up a point I have not read in the handful of reviews I had read before going into his latest film , Changeling . Often one sees movies about civil rights , racial or ethnic , but rarely in a well-produced Hollywood picture will the topic of the history of " hysterical " women being " dealt with " come up , of the hardships of those who could be pushed around by the ( given ) crooked types at the LAPD . This isn't just what Changeling is all about , either , which makes it all the more impressive how much Eastwood , via a good writer , can accomplish . This is the kind of tremendous drama that could become daunting for any other director - any one little step one way and it could be straight-to-Lifetime glop - but the director at hand here is such a pro that he's able to put in incredible artistry at nearly every step , even when it looks as though it should be cut and dry film-making . And then there's also the cast . But first , the story , which incredibly is just " a true story " at the start , is about Christine Collins ( Jolie ) who is just a regular single working mother raising her boy in LA who one day comes home and finds her son is not around : missing . The cops barely do a thing until a few months later when another child who happens to be lost is picked up , instructed by the police to say that he's the Collins boy , and that this will all make sense as a happy-ending story . This is , except for Miss Collins , who keeps asking repeatedly a very simple but quickly angered question : where is my son ? This leads into two tangents as a film : the roller-coaster tumble and rise and tumble of a mother fearing life and death for her son - sometimes in a mental hospital where she's been committed by police - and of a child killer who may or may not have killed Walter Collins , along with other missing / abducted children . Each of the tangents are interwoven with tense and particularly dark and harrowing detail , and once put together form an inexorable link that becomes all the more fascinating in the kind of way that most horror movies don't reach . Truth can be stranger than fiction , but in this case it's just uglier , and with only the faintest of hope . Which , in a sense , works to Eastwood's advantage . It'd be hard for me to imagine many other directors grappling with the facts in the case . How much Changeling sticks to the details of corruption and murder in the LAPD ranks back then ( not surprising , of course , given the history of the force in reality and in cinema ) or the Collins saga I can't say , but so much of the picture feels vital and without compromise to suggest that it is more than likely close to real , stark tragedy . Eastwood had that perfectly with Mystic River and somewhat in Million Dollar Baby . He gets it this time again , and applies a style that is one of his most ambitious ( just on the technical side the way he and his DP desaturated the color of present-day 1928 era and of the flashbacks , which come out in some realm between color and b & w , not to mention the lighting , is completely extraordinary for a drama of this magnitude ) . And , once again , Eastwood shows his master's chops as an actor's director . Jolie , who is probably more well-renown as a star than as an actress at this point in her career , reminds the audience what she's got going for her , and in fact almost appears to underrated in any estimation ( Oscar win notwithstanding ) . She's devastating at all the right moments , but tender and vulnerable and subtle without overdoing it , and at the same time conveying the star power that the role does need . It's a near triumph , and in a sense she does better on the Oscar-bait chart than her director might this time . Also noteworthy are Malkovich as the pastor ( one of the few good-guys of the tale ) , and especially Jason Butler Harner in the crucial , role of Gordon Northcott who skims that line just slightly of hamming it up and turns in one of the creepiest killers in recent memory . It may be easy to label a Clint Eastwood picture , at least as of late , is a buzz word of masterpiece or great or classic or whatever . But with Changeling , he's made what is at once a crowd-pleasing tear-jerker and one of those stories of mothers and children and women and dirty cops that stick excellently both ways , and possibly earns rightfully a status like masterpiece because he doesn't ever go soft on the subject , never turning an eye to what lies behind certain conventions or pit-falls in a script of this sort , and will only allow the smallest , most ambiguous note of hope at the end . It's intelligent , brave work .
508528	453068	64276	10.0	Best film of 1969 ; one of the best movies depicting the Hippie generation	Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper star as one of best on-screen duos of all time - 2 bikers from L . A . ( Los Angeles ) make a good score and hide the money and pretty much everything they've ever dreamed of inside one of they're gas tanks on their way to Mardi Gras . Along the way they pick up a hippie , 2 girls , a boozed and depressed lawyer ( Jack Nicholson in his real breakthrough role which he really deserved ) who finds things clearer after a little marijuana , 2 more girls ( prostitutes in Mardi Gras ) , etc . Easy Rider is a cool , immensly entertaining and flowing motion picture that often has cruel and unusual power and also often contains very potent scenes of sweeping camera movements and trippy mountain views . Hopper and company have created a real must see picture . Great performances ( Hopper and Nicholson are standouts and Fonda is almost as memorable ) matched with awesome Laszlo Kovacs photography and a ending which will challenge the audience , make this a true American classic ( ironic considering the tagline ) . Note : if it may seem as if the characters are convincing in they're doped up ways in some potent campfire scenes , it was rumored the actors were actually smoking real dope for the scenes . It worked .
507858	453068	20697	10.0	an entertaining , funny / sad classic	It's almost hard for me to picture what I will tell about The Blue Angel to those I recommend it to . It's a very special movie , and not necessarily for the only reason that some remember the film mostly for . Of course , Marlene Dietrich , in her debut , is stunningly sexy , in clothing in some scenes ( and the legs of course ) that must've caused some turned eyebrows on its first release . But despite her great charisma , and a certain feminine attitude that was unique for the time , there is really another big factor that makes the Blue Angel work a lot more for me than I thought . Hearing about the film , I got the impression it might be more of a vehicle for Dietrich , the inspiration for what would come in Madeline Kahn's equally memorable turn in Blazing Saddles . What I didn't expect was such a well-rounded , bittersweet kind of story going along , not to mention a sublime , powerful lead performance . It's really the story of Professor Rath , played without a cue missed ( and with some of his own ingenuity ) by Emil Jannings . Here is a teacher with high morals , and little tolerance for his College student's impudence . He finds out from a classmate interrogation that some of the kids are sneaking off to ' the Blue Angel ' , a club with dancers , music , and singing in half-naked costumes . He meets Lola ( Dietrich ) and against all his better judgment , he falls in head over heels , loses his job , and then . . . well , it might be best to leave it there . What then ensues is a sort of collision of an enriching structure from director Josef von Sternberg ( in that the unexpected occurs at times , if only in the little behaviors and bits of business with the characters ) , and Janning's acting . I loved how it sort of went past the barriers that might have stifled other filmmakers at the turn of the start of silent to sound - the musical numbers makes the Blue Angel club seem hypnotic , sensual , and a little crazy . Then the use of the camera , its stillness most times , focusing on the subtleties of the acting , bring forward the remnants of the finely-tuned theatrical acting from the silent era . What Jannings does here is make a character with a total arc , in this sort of downward spiral that soon occurs once he's made his decision in terms of how he feels vs his career . The last twenty minutes or so , when it finally comes back around for the teacher a 180 - from respected teacher to , well , you'll see - is rather shocking , and not as light and amusing as during the first forty minutes or so . But it also shows that Jannings , more often than not , is fearless in his timing and expressions . It's not a completely realistic performance here and there , but it sometimes doesn't need to be . Sternberg sets up such a mood that persists , with little touches ( i . e . shots of the statues moving as the clock chimes , expressionistic angles ) , that give Janning's enough room to do what he does . He helps make the character , who at first seems very expectable and usual ( a cranky teacher ) into someone we care about . Of course , one doesn't discount Dietrich's presence in the film as enough to seek out the film . She doesn't necessarily give a great acting turn , but in terms of just a great screen presence at times , of providing enough airs to make it clear why Janning's character is falling for her like this . That there are good supporting actors all around them is a plus as well . It's one of those rare films you might smile one minute and then get a little sad at the next . It's quite a lovely little movie .
510478	453068	443455	10.0	as surreal as Eraserhead or personal as Mean Streets or daring as anything out of the 20s , all Guy Maddin	It's easy to make a film that is extremely personal to a filmmaker , or has some real level of autobiography going on . And , as a result , there's a crop of personal films out there that just are not very good , because a filmmaker will confuse their factual lives and interesting cinema as one and the same when he former may not be or is too conventional or improperly melodramatic for its own good . A strong personal story or tale of a troubled or just odd childhood is good but not enough ; there needs to be ideas , some imagination even , to keep things worthwhile as compelling cinema . Brand Upon the Brain , under these conditions , is one of the most compelling things this decade as far as personal film-making goes . And , if for nothing else , it's for the virtuosity of the person ( s ) behind the lens . I'm sure it's mostly Candadian Guy Maddin's doing how the film looks and how it moves in such a splintered way as to come about as close to how memory works ( I'm sure the excruciatingly talented editor and DP helped immensely , as no other film I've ever seen has this particular grainy but subtle and coarse and light look with the subliminal cuts all the way ) , which makes it all the more a directorial 100 meter dash with full-speed . Even if the story or the characters flat out sucked , which thankfully they don't at all , I would still be enthralled by the quality and experimentation in everything technical about the picture : how it's meant to be silent , and probably is in layman's terms , but also features narration ( the track I had was from Isabella Rossellini , who does a fabulous job as part narrator and part character absorber ) , sound effects , the occasional scream or song sung , and how it's meant to be in black and white but every so often one may see color slip in a few frames or few seconds . That it was meant to be screened as a silent film , with full orchestra and actual Foley artists and chorus and possible narrator , makes it all the more wild - it wavers between real primitive film-making and pure fantasy . Which is just as well : all of the emotions here are laid for bare , and so much so for Maddin that the protagonist - a 30-something house painter who returns to his island home - is named Guy Maddin , it includes people like his actual mother and father and sister ( not the actual people , the actors playing them ) , and many anecdotes are taken from his real life or from those closest to him ( I started listening to Maddin talk about how the burial of Father in the movie is based on his actual grandfather's burial , but decided to stop to not let too many spoilers come through : it's actually a lot more fun and fascinating to figure out what's totally real or just slightly twisted ) . This works completely because of two reasons : 1 ) the autobiographical bits are interesting and captivating enough for cinema , this torn and weird relationship between siblings and parents , and 2 ) because it's wrapped up in a made-up plot by co-writer George Toles about an orphanage and crazy experiments done for rewinding aging on top of the already amazing surrealism on display with the film-making . In short , it's not only allowable , it's required for Maddin's passion to spark through . If for nothing else , even if you hate the movie ( which I can understand , it's a like it or not enterprise , like with a piece baroque period music in several consistent parts ) , it's passionate film-making and storytelling , and it brings forth a number of unknown actors into a quantity like this . And Maddin picks well , since the actors save for Rossellini or whomever on narration have to have striking faces and be able to act completely and honestly in physical form . They also submit incredibly to any of Maddin's whims ( even the gaggle of would-be Lords of the Flies orphans ) , which include dazed / feverish sleepwalking , insatiable lusting for the same / opposite sex , brain manipulation for the " nectar " , and other mad things . It's also a great structure Maddin uses ( taken from Godard's Vivre sa vie mayhap ) as we go along like in some book that grows weirder and darker as it goes along . . . but also sadder and more touching and with moments that come as delightful almost in spite of the gloom and eerie sets and lighting and smoke and so on . Brand Upon the Brain won't be for everyone , but then how could it in the 21st century ? Maddin has crafted something out dreams and recollections and visions and nightmare and hallucinations and ruminations and ( of course ) his libido and whatever else he could out of a love for movies and a love of his family ( love enough to imbue them on screen as eccentric figures out of a dark fairy tale or science fiction opera ) , and it's something for the film fans out there who crave something out of the past to be represented with life and urgency and twists on what's expected - and at the same time , for all self-indulgent purposes , keeping true to what is solid about the emotional filmgoing experience .
508889	453068	121765	10.0	The final fight is worth it , but it may be the real underrated Star Wars movie	I say that comment in full understanding that this film isn't perfect ; the love story at times reminded me of something out of a Hallmark love movie , and Hayden Christensen as the padewan Anakin shows how the right looks and attitudes still need some better acting choices to make it work right . Yet , after viewing it in an almost packed theater , and a few times since at home , I am assured it is a return to form after the very good but lacking TPM . Director / Co-writer George Lucas returns to the vivacity and great visual splendor he had in his original trilogy , and thank goodness , Jar Jar Binks was kept very minimal here . This time there's room for some new creations , though more than anything it's more of a mystery movie than anything else - also one of loss . I know I shouldn't give away spoilers , and the one line summary might give away enough , but I will say that it was a better idea than I expected to see Yoda in computer animation . Oz's original puppetry can't be touched , but with all things considered the animation team and designers matched up to the work that was cut out for them . Whether you view this movie in regular projection or digital or in a full-screen TV cut is irrelevant . Lucas just filmed it in digital film to give those in digital theaters a bit more of a kick and if you see it on a regular screen won't matter in difference . Bottom line , if you felt a little cheated from Phantom Menace , this will bring back the believer in you that a story can be told in absorbing and cool fashion while delivering awesome graphics and action , not to mention a fantastic lot of new visuals that help tell a basically good story . That it still has a couple of acting ticks should try to be overlooked
508295	453068	49010	10.0	one of the under-looked classics of the 1950s	I don't know much about cortisone , but from seeing Nicholas Ray's film Bigger Than Life I can have to guess that unless there have been some major medical breakthroughs in the 50 years since this came out , it should have a very huge warning label on the bottle . But it isn't really about cortisone , per-say , even as it does make its case convincingly for the times that such new drugs to possibly help save lives become a double-edged sword . The drug could be anything , it's merely a catalyst for character and story to go into completely un-bound turns . The Avery family could , in fact , be a Beaver-Cleaver household of the fifties , where ' father knows best ' is often a given and the house is as beautiful and elegant - in its suburban middle-class way - as is the outward appearances of the husband , wife and son . But the same catalyst , for the intents and purposes of the changes in all the characters , is utterly fascinating . I couldn't help but actually care about these people , as their sort of sheltered existence became un-covered like some kind of manhole into some metaphoric sewer that many of us sit in . There is something under the surface , and it's one wrong thing that can make it go awry . Ed Avary ( James Mason ) is such a man , who is a school-teacher and cab-driver operator ( on the side , keeping from his wife ) . He starts getting ' episodes ' , and has to go to the hospital . It's discovered that he has to live with a heart condition for the rest of his life , and only a new experimental drug , cortisone , can help with regular doses . It doesn't take too long though for things to start going south with Ed , and at first it just seems like he's a little more ornery , a little more on edge , but seemingly trying to still be the old Ed . But then there's his new school-teaching system , and the inducing and steadily increasing paranoia lifting the fog for him what his marriage really means . " I'm only staying now for the boy ! " he says in a rage at the dinner table . It becomes clear that he's in the psychosis state , in doing too much of the cortisone , and it lifts not only the comfort of this life , but the expectations and ideals of this seemingly calm , perfunctory existence . There were other pictures around this time being made in Hollywood , within but at the same time under the conventional radars ( Sirk comes to mind , though still unseen by me ) . Bigger Than Life is a great example of this , and Ray and Mason get right to the bones of it in the main chunk of the picture . Early on though its interesting to see how the tranquility is set up , and how the first barbs of bad things to come is sort of shielded over , to seem like it's nothing , like it'll be all OK . But the implications that both director and star raise through what they deliver through the material is staggering . On Ray's side , he accentuates things exceptionally by the deception of appearances ; it may be a studio-film , with the usual medium-shots and high-glossy lighting and camera moves , yet there's some room for expression , like the shadow that looms over Avary's son during an ultra-tense study session . His command over the style is shown here as one of his finest and , at times , even understated . Though finally in the climax he goes full-throttle , in a scene of ( possible ) horror that's given the full subjective treatment . Mason , meanwhile , is really at the top of his game , and it's extremely terrifying to see not just how far he can go into losing all touch with his own reality , but the reality of the usual in distortion . Even through the cortisone , Mason has this character come off at first as a braggart , but sort of believable at a PTA meeting ( Matthau's gym teacher friend finds something fishy though ) , and then it doesn't take too long for him to plunge head first into his dementia . A small scene like the one where he gets an extra prescription from his doctor , however , also shows his subtleties . Barbara Rush is also very good as his wife Lou , who as an actress successfully strips away the layers of the very kind , warm , and utmost dutiful wife , and has to actually , finally take charge of things , and do things she wouldn't possibly dream usually , like deception . The son , played by Christopher Olson , might be the weakest link of the three , as he has a character who is , of course , just a boy , and even more put to the extreme test by his father's downward spiral . Even with that it's still a believable turn . It's a piece of subversion that works all the better because of the hidden ambiguities of the ending . The whole facade of things seemingly being this way or another , is like one big joke on the audience . But it's not really a funny one ; Ray is in your face with his audience , and it's not in a retrospect way either . Things are not all honky-dory in the Eisenhower era , is what Ray says at the core , and at the end it can hardly be read that everything will turn out well for the family . The implications made are much more stronger and lasting than the actual perceived outcome . Will things be under control with the Avary's ? Who knows , is what Ray is saying , or that maybe we can learn from mistakes . But the fact that the facade came down like an avalanche is the point . It's even more surprising then to know that this picture is only available on bootlegs , through certain vendors , only occasionally on TV . If you can find it though , it's a real little ruby of a studio picture .
508604	453068	166896	10.0	Walt Disney Pictures presents : a film by David Lynch ; far from it being a crazy concept , it's a sweet little slice of great film-making	What a truly and unabashedly serene road movie this is . Lynch , through his co-writer / wife's script , seems to understand how simple but not so simple life and the people living in rural areas can be . Veering on part Iowa-neorealist fable and in part a truly experimental feat for the filmmaker ( eg how to match together the absurd yet sort of logically illogical comedy of everyday life with true whimsical overtones in visual style and choice in leading role ) , The Straight Story provides some measurable food for thought , however in little doses , and if there was ever a film that I might want to have playing right before I die - or even at my funeral , as some people have songs - it would be this . Rarely do actors get enough leverage out of playing kindly old people , but Farnsworth really digs down deep for something that is , actually , not too far from his real life ( the aches and pains in just getting up from his lawnmower seat and walking around were truer than just in portraying Straight , as Farnsworth had early-stage bone cancer during filming ) . Though aside from physical presence , Farnsworth makes an easy role not so easy . Beneath Straight's stubborn , well-mannered but no BS-in exterior , there's some demons he carries , mostly from WW2 , and a life lived via good times and very bad times in the history of his family shows always on his face and his fragile eyes . It's an extraordinary turn , and it's one of those career-capping performances that many actors only wish they could achieve let alone a veteran stuntman turned character actor like Farnsworth . And as for Lynch , he takes a few playfully wicked stabs at the rural life he's portraying , though playful the key word ; spouts of dramatic conflict and comedy come in the forms of a whole fleet of bicyclists riding on the other side of the road , or a woman who's hit one too many deer , or when he just has to get out of the rain - albeit there's one shot , one of the very best I've seen in a Lynch film , as Straight stars his journey and we see it from a perspective of the road as an uproarious in-joke to Lost Highway . Many crane shots and sweeping views of fields and tracking shots of the man on his mower are splendid , but it's this contrasted with how intimately portrayed the human interactions are , on levels of the goodness and occasional slow-ness of small-town folk , that scores Lynch his richest points . Although the film does end on a note that's satisfactory only in the sense that it leaves it on a " well , we made it , that's what counts " kind of level , and that it's far from being Badalamenti's best musical score overall ( some of it feels like it should accompany a Quaker Oats commercial , which maybe is the point ) , it remains a small but succinct triumph of the aging human spirit , where the light side of Americana still has its quirks via the Lynch universe , and abstraction blends into naturalism with the greatest of ease .
508917	453068	94964	10.0	shocking not just for what is shown but what is implied ; it's an act of perverse psychological trickery on the part of Cronenberg and Irons	Dead Ringers wasn't necessarily a very pleasant film experience , but it's one that did shake me to the core as I watched it , in a way that is slightly comparable to The Fly . As an auteur , which could likely be applied to David Cronenberg , he keeps pressing on with many themes that he's been working through in the bulk of his career - and if not outright themes , general ideas that can draw out the darkest and saddest drama there is in the minds of men . Duality , to be sure , and also the complications that arise through forms of fetishism , or rather a kind of strange obsession with things involving the body , touching , feeling , close to one another in ways that are truly grotesque ( in this case there is the quintessential nightmare scene where Bev sees Claire split apart himself from Eliot , his twin , by taking a bite out of the deformed connection with a vein in her mouth ) , and sometimes having to do with outright criminals ( History of Violence and Spider come to mind as those who are just right on the brink all the time ) . But there's more , probably some things I didn't quite catch on , though I wouldn't put all of it on Cronenberg for making it such a beautiful work where objective perception through the camera - a bit like a documentary in a clinical sense , as many have noted - goes on with the subjectivity that is blurred through the twins . And in typical Cronenberg fashion , there's something of an exploitation catch to start with , that soon dissipates upon a deepening of the characters . In what is one of the very bravest acting challenges , Jeremy Irons plays twin Canadian gynecologists , Bev and Eliot Mantle ( Mantle = Mental ? obvious perhaps but not too much so ) . They have some unorthodox methods , though not necessarily related to how they treat patients in the office . It's almost been a game for years , we find out , how they go between having women without them noticing . But actress Claire ( the very talented , and maybe not quite on screen enough , Geneviève Bujold ) can soon tell the difference after meeting one to see if she can have children , which she can't due to three uterus's , and then getting screwed over ( literally ) by another . But there is love between her and Bev , who is soon revealed as the more vulnerable and dependent of the two while Eliot is more confident , the ladies man , the one winning awards and getting teaching positions . It soon becomes apart of a breakdown process for Bev as she leaves him to go get work elsewhere , and soon its a spiral into drugs and delirium , including some unorthodox procedures with a ' gold ' clamp . The ingredients here could make for some truly wacky cinema , but under the hands of Cronenberg it's done to such a realistic extent that you can't escape the humility of the situations . These brothers , as well as brother-to-lover , are linked in a manner that defies general descriptions . And it's not necessarily in a very fetishistic construct , though it pops up once and again ( my favorite was seeing the first sex scene between Claire and Bev - or is it Eliot , maybe it is - when he has her tied up to the bed with hospital equipment , as it's dangerous as anything Cronenberg has done with sex on film but touching in its long takes ) . But as in Spider , Cronenberg wouldn't have it get done correctly without the proper lead , and in Irons he finds someone who has such a wide range in pure theatricality : formal grace , apprehension , embarrassment , cruelty , reckless behavior whilst on drugs , delirium , moments of quiet tension , pain , fear , anger , it's all there up for grabs . Even when some scenes near becoming a little flat almost by Cronenberg's wavering detachment Irons brings it back to something that is profound . This is something unexpected , given that some scenes have to rely on levels of dark depravity ( the first ' test ' of the new instruments during surgery ) and dark comedy even ( the question inferred about sex with a dog to a woman is priceless ) . It might come close to being , oddly enough , a definitive work from the director , even if it isn't perhaps his absolute best film . Yes , it's tone is cold and without the levels of sentimentality that could come had it been someone who went for a lower common denominator . Yet it has what most of his fans come to expect - twisted psychological drama , intense and quick shocks , and high-caliber performances to match the technical aspects achieved . It's not an easy film to love , but damn if one can't look away and not get it out of their heads once it's over .
508747	453068	70698	10.0	takes cues from Hitchcock and then takes a leap forward ; De Palma's best , most bizarre comedy / thriller	I'd have to say that this film , though sometimes just shamefully manipulative for audience reaction ( and I say that sort of as a compliment ) , is one of De Palma's very best films , both artistically and just in sheer entertainment value . It's got the low-budget quality of an AIP production , but set apart from Roger Corman's films or other films from the company . It's got such a strange , occasionally off-the-hinges , but dedicated wit that it's hard to ignore . In fact , this wit , and a good number of tight , screwed-up close-up angles , special point of view takes , and some of De Palma's trademarks ( split-screen , ambiguous villain , women in trouble , etc ) are what set it apart from being a complete Hitchcock homage . It's no doubt that the director is so in love with the Master's style that , apparently , he even times his edits and shots to go with Bernard Herrmann's music . But what sets Sisters apart from even the more macabre Hitchcock films is that since De Palma is working in a low-budget , under-the-radar , with actors with not much credit to their names , things can be taken further than usual in dealing with the psychological ' whoas ' of what goes on . This is possibly one of the most morbid tales to be told in 70's cinema . Another important aspect to Sisters and its success is the faith that De Palma has in his actors / friend Margot Kidder and Jennifer Salt . They fit their roles so well one can't imagine big-name actors doing them any better ( though Salt , up until the last act , is playing it all appropriately one-note ) . Kidder's Danielle / Dominique is quite a character too , one with so much complexity her story becomes like some wild ball of string that gets unraveled with little blood-laden marks along the road . Danielle brings home a truly nice guy , Phillip ( good character actor , Lisle Wilson ) , sleeps with him , and then goes ape when she doesn't get her medicine . . . or is it her sister , Dominique ? This first half hour is like some kind of satirical , sincere kind of film-making that could make just a great , open-ended short film . But with the addition of De Palma's split screen ( possibly the best he's used it in any of his films ) , the story spins off into Grace , a reporter who gets on the case on her own to find out what happened to the body . This leads her into a very dark place , one that leads her into something so bizarre I dare not mention here . But those last fifteen-twenty minutes or so are where things become a kind of make-or-break test in a sense for the audience ; how far can one push this overtly surreal quagmire of a scene where the ' doctor ' is present in front of our two main actresses ? The ' doctor ' himself is played by William Finley , and it would be arguable that his is such a toweringly creepy , scary performance of a villain that it becomes almost too uncanny . In this climax one has to wonder how far it will go , and then it becomes clear that it's almost the point of the story to go over the edge like this . We're dealt with an already peculiar premise of two Siamese twins , one of whom may or may not be alive , and how they're let loose onto the world . Early on it seems like this might just be an off-beat , funny noir kind of story , but by the end it becomes a bit more . It takes originality to pull off some of the scenes here , or at least faith in what's written will work on screen . In a way this is the best place to see the bridge of De Palma's early black comedies ( Hi Mom , Greetings ; the neat opening TV show scene brings this to mind ) and the hit or miss thrillers that have dominated his long career . Basically , for me , this was a hit , and that it was manipulative , sordid , and left the viewer still wanting some answers , makes it as successful a wink ( if not homage ) to Hitchcok that the filmmaker has done .
