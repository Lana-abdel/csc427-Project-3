508745	453068	421054	1.0	the worst thing that Tony Scott would ultimately want to hear about this film is that it's boring , but in the end it is	Boy , what a wreck to sit through with Domino , and I mean like a ship-sinking sized one . But maybe the only quasi-decent thing I can say about it is that I stuck through it , and didn't stop it or walk away mid-way through it . I knew that it would almost be sort of hypocritical to not finish watching the movie , just to see how far it could go into its own megalomaniac ego-trip of an " acid - punk - fever - dream - whatever - the - f " scape into movie-making this is . And I'm not sure how everything that could go wrong with a production like this does . Maybe there's something about it that has ended up appealing to some people ( Tarantino , who of course has an allegiance with Scott and some of the actors in cast here , listed it in his top films of 05 ) , but it just flew over my head . Or rather , it didn't , it went right into my senses and at first , I tried to find it OK . Then , it went through the Alex-in-the-Clockwork Orange chair phase . And then it became towards the end with the Las Vegas scenes something that ended up pushing it up into the list of the 10 worst films I've ever seen - and one that director Tony Scott wouldn't want to hear more than anything - it's boring . Because after a while such an onslaught of bombarding images , sounds , voices , editing as if - much as Suvari's character refers to Christopher Walken's character's attention span - a ferret was at the buttons , the tint on the camera , and all things considered , were monotonous to the point of inertia . But what's even more disappointing in that , as any filmmaker with talent , which Tony Scott has , can make material into pretentious rubbish ( just see Godard's last twenty years of work more or less to see that ) , is that there is potential here , in the cast and even in the script . Taking aside Kiera Knightley , mentioned below , there's Mickey Rourke , Delroy Lindo , Lucy Liu , and Walken too , who in the latter of the bunch in little spots does try and give some personality and humor - " what's with the font " . And ironically the script , by Donnie Darko's Richard Kelly , isn't the biggest problem here , at least not on the outset . If anything he starts off the film in predictable fashion like any self-respecting post-modern American action film would do in non-linear , start-with-a-bang style writing with a couple of bits of witty dialog . But in the end potential gets squandered , and what I was left with at least was the equivalent of a decent B-movie type of steak grilled into something incomprehensible . I wonder really if Tony Scott thinks he's making art here or a fun B-movie or more or what . Maybe it's the former ; he was a painter before a movie-maker . But the professional focus of previous action-film guilty pleasures like True Romance and Crimson Tide is lost within what he tries to do with the material . Did he think he was over-compensating for something , or that his style , or lack thereof , meant to heighten the experience for the viewer . I know what he was going for , in the style of something like Oliver Stone - or even in pushing the envelope forward in what he ( more successfully ) hinted at in Man on Fire . But style this flamboyant , cut-a-second , and really shallow and basically commercial ( he , too , was a director of commercials before films , see Top Gun for proof ) does not work with material that , as flawed as it is anyway , deserves some credibility . It's almost like Scott doesn't trust the viewer to just take the basics of the movie , so he overloads it , pushes the envelope , and at least by mid-way I knew it was going to backfire . With a cast like this too , you know there could be possibilities . Where else will you get in-jokes , or rather obvious ' ho-ho ' jokes with cast members of Beverly Hills 90210 ? However Scott combines his rambunctious , clickety-clack motions with his crew with symbolism possibly provided by the script ( goldfish as a metaphor for the loss of connected feeling , gimme a break ) , and with characters in all their shallow moves we're supposed to care about with relationships and meaning and such , with a leading lady that doesn't work , at all . Kiera Knightley is attractive , and is OK in some movies ( notably the Pirates of the Caribbean films ) . But here I just didn't see her in any kind of believable way as a bounty hunter . I saw her as Kiera Knightley . Even in a moment of peril where she lap-dances for gangsters just to get her man behind bars , it doesn't work . She collides alongside Scott's direction into the cataclysm that is the movie Domino , where lots of " cool " action and gun-fire and violence mixes with drug trips , underdeveloped characters , lots of " whoa-isn't that cool " style , and other things , until it becomes one of the great messes of the past few years . In short , and I rarely agree with Entertainment Weekly ( if they were the ones who said this quote ) , Domino is indeed trash imitating art imitating trash . And I sometimes really dig trashy films . But not when they're acting like they should be taken seriously .
510079	453068	59464	1.0	barely watchable on it's own ; one of the MST3K's best commentaries though	Monster a Go-Go is one of those dreaded would-be drive-in cash-in movies that trying to watch it on its own is an act in futility . Trying to watch the moments of bad actors reciting bad dialog on sets loaned out by the director's mother and featuring the one hook as a 7 foot 6 inch man who's made to look TALLER in the ridiculous high-angle shots is excruciating enough . But then there's also the narrator sounding like he should be reading copy off of an industrial short on the history of buttons , the nearly inaudible dialog read in outdoor scenes , the random scene with the kids dancing at the hall to rock AND roll music , the atrocious ( let me repeat that , atrocious ) lighting where , as the Mystery Science Theater guys observe , their faces have been burned off , and an ending that wraps things up like a tarp scotch taped around a 400 pound dead guy who left this Earth by leprosy . It's a wretched work of science fiction that talks too much , doesn't walk the walk , and tries to compensate with lots of shots of tanks and army men and stuff cause , you know , that's impressive to the kiddies in these flicks . Luckily , Joel , Crow and Tom Servo are to the rescue with their commentary , and it is definitely one of the best that they recorded in the Joel era . Most comments are just plain silly ( their number with John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt , or just the echoing of the goofy sounds of the soundtrack are classic ) , but there are many a harsh , cutting word against the flick too . I loved just seeing how at the opening credits they acknowledged it would suck - " Hey , heh , hey guys , see Bill Rebane , two of them , shows up once , then again , and . . . oh this is going to suck " . It might seem a little biased that at the end , something unusual , they actually boo the movie ( not undeserved , but still ) , and up until before it ends keep asking when the hell it will end . But throughout I kept on either chuckling out just rolling-on-the-floor laughing at not just the specific little throwaway gags or lines that are too obscure for some , but just how it would match up to certain parts ( i . e . starts to fall asleep , Narrator chimes in , they all startle to wake up ) .
510865	453068	126916	2.0	easily the worst film Sam Raimi has directed yet	I remember seeing For Love of the Game in the theater and thinking ' this isn't the same Sam Raimi that directed the Evil Dead trilogy and A Simple Plan , is just can't be . ' It's one thing that it's a Kevin Costner movie , which in and of itself carries a certain formula that can take down director and ship with him . Maybe there might be some even die-hard baseball movie fans out there ( baseball itself is cool , the movies from that can either hit or really miss ) who might appreciate this film , but as that and as a romantic melodrama it's just , well , a shamble of formula , over-sentimentality , and over-wrought dialog . Some of the supporting acting isn't too terrible , as John C . Reilly and JK Simmons are usually hard to disappoint . But it's practically humorless , and ( this is a bit subjective here ) can be somewhat incredulous against Yankees fans . The premise itself could've worked - aging baseball pitcher does a perfect game while his romantic life has a checkered past . But Raimi isn't able to breathe that much life into the script , and the Hollywood feel of it just adds to its , well , blandness . It's not one of the worst movies of 1999 , but it's a definite yes that I would not only not recommend it , but would steer clear of it if it came on TV again . Maybe as a piece of fluff it might just be a below satisfactory effort , but from Raimi it's emanates from me a big " huh ? "
510472	453068	843873	2.0	it barely qualifies as a guilty pleasure ( mostly for its climax )	I would probably want to give this movie a zero if not for the climax , which involves not really Snakes on a Train , but rather Train IN a Snake . The premise was cooked up far more than likely over the course of a night of beers after hearing about Snakes on a Plane in production ( this , in fact , was released to coincide with that film's release ) . The joke is probably not lost on those who will seek this out ; I don't think there would be a soul out there who would consider this anything as a serious action-thriller effort ( unless on an ironic level beyond the capacity for rational thought ) . It's about a Mayan curse placed on a woman who's damned by her family for leaving with another man , and is soon seen sickened and coughing up green slime laced with , of course , snakes . She and her beau go on a train headed for Los Angeles , and very soon after the more-than-cliché characters are privy to snakes overtaking the train - with the originator woman becoming a snake herself . If it would be worth listing more about the movie I would , but there isn't enough time during the day . All that can be said for the quality factor is that it's almost on-existent ; there are student short films with larger budgets . Maybe that was a wise calculation on the filmmakers ' end , that there would be so many copies sold , just for the joke factor alone , that they would re-coup their budget in the first weekend . Because by looking at the sets ( the trains themselves change randomly in the middle of a scene ! ) , the actors ( if you can call them that , with only one other actor - the one with the very thin hair who hits on the one woman throughout the movie - who benefited from the flick being produced ) , the FX ( also next to non-existent , making the effects in Snakes on a Plane seem like Star Wars ) , and the actual CGI snakes themselves , with the final huge behemoth snake something to behold in sci-fi movie channel terms . This all means , basically , that it is a laugh riot every step of the way ( especially , as cruel as it sounds , when a little girl becomes involved in a snake's " attention " ) , with the very disregard for good taste working well in its favor . This being said , it is also 100 % disposable , like a B-movie sour-flavor lollipop .
509916	453068	763304	2.0	fantastic for laughs - for all the unintentional ( ? ) reasons - though lacks things like texture and quality . . .	. . . which is fine . Doogal probably wouldn't of caught my attention in the slightest - and I barely took a glance to it when it was first released ( or escaped ) into theaters last year . But then when I saw Jon Stewart's credits on this site , his name popped up for this movie . I clicked it and was momentarily horrified : Jimmy Fallon , Ian McKellan , Judi Dench , William H . Macy ? One of these does not belong ! So after some head-scratching I watched it more as a goof than anything with friends . Boy , oh boy , you don't quite know what you got till it's gone , so the song goes . Doogal is an American re-dubbing of a movie that was in English ( and , apparently , featured Bill Nighy in the now Jimmy Fallon role , which is completely inexplicable and even offensive to Nighy fans ) , and not even a GOOD re-dubbing : the dialog most of the time doesn't match up at all , and one character , a moose ( voiced by Kevin Smith - as a favor to the Weinsteins to be sure ) , barely opens his mouth . It's got a good guy and bad guy that are springs ( with Stewart playing one of them , in maybe the most ironically cool part of the miasma ) , tired and old-hat pop-culture references left out from the 90s and elsewhere , which come at every turn possible , and has animation that might look decent if this were a ) on the Nick Jr channel , or b ) a video-game created for kids who are playing their very first video game . As entertainment , however , it is meant to be a goofy journey to get three diamonds to free a bunch of kids frozen in a carousel while Zeebad ( Stewart ) plots to get the diamonds to freeze the sun ( albeit no one seems to notice that Zebadee , McKellan's spring , lacks to know-how to use his mustache - yes , his mustache - to thaw out the youngsters ) . It's such a poorly run ship you wonder if people really lost their jobs over it ( or if the Weinsteins got stoned out of their gourde with the re-writers after green-lighting the re-dubbing ) , and , ugh , I haven't even gotten yet to mention the sexual tension between a caterpillar and a cow ! So , in a way , the movie is actually really funny and spectacularly campy in the way that one might see in an old AIP release from the 60s or 70s . Only difference is , this is supposed to be a legitimate CGI movie for kids ! This being said , actors like Macy and Stewarts ( maybe not Goldberg , who knows ) took on the project knowing what they're getting into . Needless to say , if any good could've come from it , the spring has been mentioned often in splendid self-deprecating ( and self disbelieving ) manner by Stewart on the Daily Show .
510516	453068	490204	3.0	Reinging and ringing over my head	It's basically impossible not to consider the tragedy of as the most significant event of a nightmare day on American soil . At the least it tore up New York city , and left many lives devastated . The writer / director of Reign Over Me , Mike Binder , tries to set up a form of critic-proof shield around his film by making the central tragedy for his protagonist that his family - wife , daughters - were killed on one of the planes in and for years has slipped into a horrible funk that has made him delusional and pretty close to schizophrenic . It's not using for a movie that is troubling ; films like United 93 and to a lesser extent World Trade Center benefited from facing the horror of the day head on . It's using it for this particular tragedy for this man's life . At first it's almost more of a plot device : since it was victims , the government paid out a huge amount to Charlie Fineman ( Sandler ) , so that he can still live in his apartment , refurnish the kitchen as he argued with his wife over on their last phone call , and play video games and jam out on classic rock without the worry of not having a job . Unlike , for example , the Fisher King , where the psychotic widower was also homeless , this solves the problem of dealing with monetary status . But then , as the character develops , it becomes more of a nuisance than anything . There's no depth developed within this situation aside from Charlie not dealing with the loss of his family , and what's explored in the friendship that's reconnected with Dr . Johnson ( Cheadle ) , his ex college roommate , is really bizarre and unamusing at the least and just plain stupid at worst . The way that the two connect rings false on counts of writing and directing , if not all the way on performance . Which leads to the two biggest flaws in this colossal waste , as the two feed into one another : Mike Binder's writing and Sandler's performance . I'm not one to say that Sandler can't act , on the contrary his turn in Punch-Drunk Love is revelatory , and I've even enjoyed him replaying practically the same persona in his string of comic star vehicles ( with a few obvious exceptions i . e . Click , Eight Crazy Nights ) . Here , however , he plays it all as incredulously one-note . You truly want to feel sympathy for the character - some will , to be sure - but Sandler blights this by not giving us anything to see that he wasn't always this cantankerous and crazy and demented . As clichéd as it might've been , albeit on top of the others included in the piece , a flashback wouldn't of hurt aside from the brief blips of his former life . It's such a misstep in perceiving tones of scenes , playing things for goofy laughs and drama sometimes in the same beat . Only a highly charged scene involving a gun carries any leverage in the acting department . But then the other problem , the writing , drives down most of the potential in the piece . I would be interested in seeing a film that explores some of the dimensions of a character coping with deep-rotted grief , yet not in this ham-fisted manner . On top of how Binder deals with Charlie's trauma , there's the friendship aspect , which attempts to pull some dimension for Cheadle's character . To his credit , Cheadle does give it his best , but much of the script asks him to go from being rational ( i . e . dealing with that on / off sexual harassment charge ) to being freewheeling and taking Charlie as a kind of guide to living how one wants to ( i . e . going against family ) . It becomes so frustrating that by the time some of the logical steps come closer - the psychiatric treatment Charlie does need , and is entitled to get - it's almost so out of reach for one to care from the blocks in the material . It's contrivance of plot details , it's contrivance of character , and it's a total sham and manipulation by the time of an unbelievable catharsis . It's simply not a good movie , or at the very least overrated .
508180	453068	478087	4.0	want to take a gamble ? this movie STINKS !	Robert Luketic , director of 21 , doesn't have as his major folly to change the characters from the book ( which I have not read but heard a bit about ) from an all Asian group of card counters in Las Vegas to a more ' mixed ' lot ( i . e . about are Asian now ) . Nor is it even his casting of his lead actor ( Jim Sturgess probably brings more charm to the two-dimensional part than one would've thought was possible ) . His biggest folly was not questioning as he went through the motions of making a silly , contrived , hyper - slick - music - video - shot - in - Jiminy - Jilikers - High - def if there was anything to change up on an audience who knows such motions through and through . The only thing that might differentiate this movie from a whole host of smart-guy-in-a-new-dirty-pond flicks ( and I can't name them all but the likes of Rounders is a masterpiece compared to this ) is that the characters turn into models from GQ and Maxim by the time they hit it big in Vegas . Not expecting much from 21 is just about right , or even worse . And don't get me started on Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Spacey . It's a paycheck day once again for these two very good - sometimes even fabulous - thespians , who slum their roles as a would-be-DeNiro-in-Casino and a shady MIT professor who by the looks of the movie should be characterized as team-leader-Satan respectively . They too understand what is going on in 21 , which is an ol ' fish-out-of-water fable about smart people doing stupid things with lots of money at stake as an MIT kid ( Srugess ) with aspirations for Harvard med joins a group that goes to Vegas and stakes out hundreds of thousands per weekend by counting cards and hustling from table to table . I guess , in a way , I don't blame them for not doing much at all with their roles . But one would hope that there would be something , ANYTHING , that would make this as something for them to distinguish , that the director & / or the script would give them something to do aside from filling in pat performances from at least a good few other parts they've played . As mentioned , Sturgess at least brings a little bit of interest to a character carved out of some sympathy as kid who gets in way over his head . There's not much else with supporting players either . Kate Bosworth is the kind of actress whom you think can sort of act , or at least knows how to pretend to really act . But there's also something just not there clicking , something when she puts on the ' concerned ' face that just screams so bland that you can't even take it . The writers also plug in clichés of yester-year ( and not long enough ) : Jacob Pitts as the snotty side character in the group who is just too jealous and stubborn to stay in the group long once Benn arrives ; the old nerdy friends from before Ben's trip into blackjack land , who are there as a function and not as any real character ' base ' . And then there is the script in and of itself - giving us such forlorn twists and turns in its final reels that I want to choke on my popcorn - and the direction as well , which pumps up the volume for the kids while making sure to completely sanitize a real Vegas experience for college-aged younguns ( and , of course , the shallowest of all , the two hot male and female leads have to hook up , without much connection whatsoever ) . Maybe you could give it a couple of quick peeks , maybe five minutes , when it's on TNT in a couple of years . But as far as giving any substantial money to this enterprise ? The house wins , Johnny , that's the way it is .
510296	453068	69768	5.0	and finally " Ape Killed Ape ! "	Battle for the Planet of the Apes is a disappointment for what the director doesn't accomplish that he already had so well in his previous installment ( the dark veneer is gone , as are any relevant comparisons to the present with any level of satire ) , and it's the kind of cheese that a little kid will wrap in tiny balls and hurl at the screen whenever it comes upon him to do so . This time it's war ! Caesar butts heads with Aldo , a war-monger gorilla with a thick skull and a less than one-sided personality who is reminiscent of the Michael Biehn character in Planet Terror : Give em the guns ! Give em ALL the guns ! And so , war is waged between the straggling humans and the now powerful apes and gorillas . Will there be a voice of reason ? The plot doesn't have much cohesion except to make it clear that this one will tie up whatever loose ends there needs to be with the first part , just in case anyone really wants to take notice ( of course , there are some more than thousands of years in gap space between five and one , but who's counting ) . In the most crucial scenes in the picture , where the battle is waged harshest and Aldo has to answer for a horrible atrocity , Thompson only films it adequately enough so that it doesn't ring badly on TV . There are some ambitions in the script , even to include the original " Lawgiver " , played by none other than the great John Huston . But it's not for much trouble ; there's even a lapse of judgment in seeming to put in lots of footage from the PAST films for some reason , which must be attributed to laziness on the writers and editors . Probably on par , if not maybe a smidgen above , the 2001 remake of POTA , ' Battle ' doesn't end with a bang , but with a bunch of bangs that amount to the emotional wallop of a whimper .
509635	453068	90859	5.0	" No . . . you're history "	Looking at Cobra is like peeking in to a time capsule dug underground and unearthed for all to look at in awe . Not because it's a particular ' good ' movie , but because of its time and place and its level of completely tasteless action and " plot " . Cobra stars Stallone as Cabretti aka " Cobra " , a killer robot masquerading as an Italian-stallion detective who wears his sunglasses like they come as part of the GI Joe action set . He's after a killer , or killers as he has to continually point out to his pathetically clichéd higher-ups , and has to protect a woman , model Ingrid ( Brigitte Nielson as decent eye-candy and less than so-so actress ) from being targeted by the killer squad . The tag-line seems to suggest that Cobra might be wiping out criminal elements as they appear in reality in 1986-era L . A . The crime wave was something fierce at the time , going as far as to influence comic books like Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns . But Cobra functions so much as a comic book it would keep Frank Miller gasping for the oxygen tank : Cobra is after a ridiculously armed and well-stocked group of assassins who we see stand in formation in dungeons or basements or whatever clanging their axes like they're trying to emulate the army art from Pink Floyd's the Wall . You would wonder why something sensible would happen against a band of crazy killers who seem to kill at random until they focus on this ONE WOMAN , like say if the FBI would get involved . . . but no , it's only Cobra , he's the cure , they're disease , yada-yada . So much of this is so implausible it counter-acts what could be some good ol ' mindless dumb action fun . It's TOO mindless , and at times too boring ( those 80s montages are so wretched as to edit on the beats of the forgettable 80s synth-pop ) to even really care . If it isn't dull then it's just so . . . huh ? There is a car chase , for example , where one sees Cobra chasing after ( or being chased by ) the killer squad , and seeing his car once or twice do one of those jumps and crashes that would normally kill any car is one thing - but when it reaches the eighth or ninth time it's just too much . Add to that Stallone's non-acting , his incredulous one-liners , and you got yourself some dated stuff . And yet , it isn't exactly a failure or a totally bad movie . The opening sequence at the supermarket is exciting and violent in that degree that keeps tension building for at least a little while . And the director - hack George P . Cosmatos - does direct some of the absurd violence in the climax at the factory with some panache and thrills . But it's hard to stack up against what doesn't work in the film . Cobra is what other cop movies - not least of which Stallone's own co-vehicle Tango & Cash and Demolition Man - parodided , and it shows .
510577	453068	425430	5.0	leaves me not really offended , though never impresses either , it's just a mediocre horror movie	I don't think that I would completely write off the Pang brothers , Oxide and Danny , as they don't completely go into the self-indulgent post-modernism that has panged , no pun intended , the horror filmmakers of late . Only once or twice did I see that they might jump into ' Saw ' territory . But even having not seen the majority of the Japanese horror movies that have give rise to the over-abundance of ' ghosts-in-my-house ' wave ( and , likewise , to their American counterparts ) , there isn't too much with surprise or shocks in The Messengers . I'm sure they're self-conscious of the films they're paying homage / ripping off ( the one scene involving the crows and their rendezvous with John Corbett's character is like a chummier mash of The Birds and North by Northwest ; Shining and Close Encounters references seem a little more than clear to me too ) , yet they also succumb to having their film be really affect-less . It's never too stupid though ; I didn't have a disliking toward any one character , with the exception being maybe towards the end with Corbett ( I don't think I'm spoiling much there ) , and it's the sort of typical family - moves - into - a - creepy - house story that decides to hit the usual bases without going rapidly wrong on the marks . But there's also the muddle that comes in dealing with the supernatural side of things , amid the average scares of ' what did I hear in the other room , I'll go check ' . For one thing , the variations on who the ghosts and demons in the house are - if they're the family that used to live there , or if they might be the whatevers that killed off the family striking back at the new family in the house . There's fair acting from the family ( Kristen Stewart of Panic Room fills in the teenage-girl niche , and there's competent work from McDermott and Miller ; Colbert is a little creepy , but I guess that's the point ; William B . Davis's bit part is the best real surprise of the movie ) , but it's all at the mercy of a standard script that might've been better , damn if I say it , as a half hour TV episode or something . Only sometimes , too , are there some potential unintentional laughs to be had , mostly towards the climax and with the very randomly placed crows that can only come in a pretty inexplicable flick such as this . In the end , the Messengers is nothing new , and won't contribute much at all to the horror genre at large , but I wouldn't throw it in my ' I hate this movie so much ' bin either , as it only continues to that non-threatening realm of the kinda-creepy PG-13 haunted house picture .
509639	453068	78056	6.0	it has its moments . . . and then it also doesn't	Paradise Alley is set in 1946 in the dingy and dirty streets of Hell's Kitchen - or the Bowery , take your pick , maybe more like the Bowery - and is centered on a group of characters , specifically three brothers , and how they try to maintain in their squalor or , as it turns out , try and make a way for themselves to get out . It's a sentimental picture as it tries to act super tough and muscular , and it's kind of like a Saturday afternoon movie for the guys who have already seen Rocky and Rambo flicks too many times and want to see something sort of " different " . It certainly is . And not always in a good way . What I liked was seeing how the actors playing the brothers interacted . Cosmo , Victor and Lenny are impressionable and work very well as this trio dynamic . One had high aspirations and has a big mouth but a fairly good heart , another is a crippled war hero who's life has not worked out at all like he might have wanted for himself or his girl , and the other is a fairly content and BIG-sized ice delivery man who finds himself needing money to want that boat house . I liked also how Stallone put these characters against the lumbering idiot gangsters who were too bumbling to really make it as big-shots but could be threatening enough to other bums and the like in the neighborhood . Not to mention the character and performance of Frank McRae as the 40-something wrestler who lives in total degradation even as he's very good at what he does . Oh , and Tom Waits of course , for a role that is merely a blip but one that brings a smile all the same . The problems seem to come for Stallone that he isn't confident enough to take the material where it needs to go as a down-and-dirty grungy street flick . He gussies it up with over-blown camera moves and editing tricks ( I hated the freeze-screen effects used ) , and seem to not always be as strong with dealing with melodrama and the natural way people talk as he did in the first Rocky . If there was a time to make this story maybe it was right after he has his first big success , and then move on to more conventional stuff . But it is at times fairly schmaltzy , and not all of the acting is very good ( the female actresses are all pretty weak , and for a couple of good scenes Lee Canalito feel really flat as the " happy " wreslter brother dubbed " The Salami " ) . Stallone and Asante fare better with the material , and even Stallone himself goes hammy with his own words in some scenes ; Stallone is Stallone , not a Pacino or De Niro , so heavy-duty dramatic scenes don't seem to cut it out as well . And yet , the film does have its moments . I especially dug that final wrestling match , the two contenders ( the other being , I think , Terry Funk ) duking it out as a rain storm is coming down in the arena and the power keeps cutting in and out with lightning effects thrown in . Stallone does make this an epic and nasty and brutal final bout , and it does bring a pretty satisfying completion to a film that is enjoyable but too clichéd by half .
509544	453068	64939	6.0	the biker movie pathos , by Al Adamson	In order to get any enjoyment or entertainment , or just dumb-fun in a B-movie ( if that ) kind of way , like Satan's Sadists ( not inappropriately released on DVD in some circles by Troma ) , is to take into context that it was , of course , the late 60's , and it remains in the sub-genre that is the biker-movie . I almost hesitate to slap the label ' exploitation flick ' on it because one would have to take completely into mind what exploitation entails . Maybe there were many ( maybe mostly ) good-hearted bikers like the ones in Easy Rider that wanted nothing more than to get stoned and ride their wheels without too much trouble . But that is in a particular kind of movie that tries ( and succeeds ) to rise above the expectations of the enclave of biker movies . For the most part , as with Satan's Sadists and many others , a biker gang with a cool sounding name goes into a town , bothers the habitants to a point of total suspense and shock , and the filmmaker may or may not try to dig a little under the surface , go beyond the expectations up to a point . One of the things that makes Satan's Sadists work , up to a point , is that producer / director Adamson usually doesn't mistake what it is that he's making . A film like this , when it played ( where and if of course being part in question ) , would just be used as fodder for make-out sections and beer contests for those in the cars at the drive-ins , just good enough to not make anyone start chucking things at the screen . Adamson brings forth all the ideal elements - a gang of six ( including the perennial grungy / sexy female ) with attitude braced in their eyes and sunglasses , the older straight-laced couple , the good-looking younger couple , and plenty of room for tracking , driving shots of bikes . The gang here of the title run into a cop and his wife , a waitress , another young guy and the owner of a small pit stop in the middle of the California desert . Basically , describing the plot would be moot ; say enough that it is as much of a usual biker film as it is a revenge picture ( and usually the two go one in the same with these movies ) . To Adamson's credit , given a group of non-professional actors ( or B / C / D movie actors ) that are hit or miss ( the bikers are all alright , as are the cop and his wife , but some of the other parts of the younger women are pretty bad ) , he tends to push some of the boundaries of what can be done within the framework of the structure . We have an idea of what will go on , of course , after a crucial moment in the film , but there are little things , like when the bikes brake-down in the desert , or when other minor female characters are introduced all of a sudden in the desert , or the impromptu dance scene in the restaurant ( though that is a staple in many of these flicks , a cool one at that ) . It's when Adamson sometimes kids himself with what he's doing that it steers away , like a little mini-speech given by the groups leader about ' the man ' versus the ' love ' generation before a certain murder takes place . And the music , while with a cool opening number , is draining aside from an interesting drum solo here and there . I wouldn't say to start with Satan's Sadists if you're just starting to get into these kinds of films , as it is relatively hard to find and Adamson , while not without his cult fan-base , was unknown to me before seeing the film and really does nothing more than make your standard genre movie . However it's not to say that within the ' standards ' there aren't some creative flourishes . I liked how there was always the one character clinging onto getting stoned and tripped whilst the others went on with their tough business , who even provides a couple of laughs . And where the film heads to is exciting on the most primitive , fast-food sort of level . There are certainly ' better ' movies out there , probably with better acting and better use of music and locations . But at least in Adamson there is a little experimentation and touches of daring in his style ; little insert close-ups and zooms / pans are interesting , and at times a certain zaniness tries to work its way into the steady shots . If a biker picture , in all of its likely exploitive tendencies and cardboard psychology , is more about attitude and using what is there within the limitations , Satan's Sadists is not bad , though not great .
509078	453068	90568	6.0	for any other director it'd be a very good if dated 80s effort . . .	. . . for Hal Ashby , it's something of a tragedy in the course of his career . At this point , to give some background , he wasn't getting the same kind of prime work he did in the 70s ( Harold and Maude , Last Detail , Coming Home , Shampoo , Being There ) , this despite the fact that he won an Oscar as editor and nominated for director . After some low-budget comedies - and a less than great Rolling Stones movie - he took on this neo-noir co-scripted by Oliver Stone , and had a good cast in place with Jeff Bridges playing the on-off lush ex-detective , Rosanna Arquette as the call girl entrapped by cold , grinning / vicious pimp / pusher played by newcomer Andy Garcia . It seemed like a solid genre picture , one that could hopefully make a few bucks among the crowds looking for another fix of action and crime and romance and what-have-you . As far as I know , I'm not sure why Ashby was then fired midway through by the producers . Maybe it was paranoia on the producers part ( Ashby had an addiction to cocaine , ironically considering the subject matter of the film , and perhaps he was still on it during filming ) , or he did genuinely screw up somehow , but seeing that he wasn't part of the production all the way through , it casts the film in something of another light . Taking it as it is , there's some entertainment to be had with the tense dialog from Stone between Bridges and Garcia , and also some good chemistry between Bridges and Arquette . Hell , there's even a compelling undercurrent of redemption that's to be had with Bridges's Matthew coming back from bad alcoholic blackouts to track down the killer of the call girl Sonny . But , and this is the crucial part , the film often has the feel as though it was seriously meddled with by the producers . This isn't to say Ashby's touches with his actors isn't there , as that's compelling enough , but the soundtrack in place makes this so painfully scream out 1980 THRILLER ! that it boggles the mind like a hangover with Miami Vice . And there's even a section of the plot that , as perhaps with Matthew as well , blacks out right after Sonny's death . Certain other scenes don't feel like they had that touch of what came at least mostly naturally to Ashby , which was interesting editing . It would've been one thing if this was just another in a series of damned efforts from the director ( apparently another film he made also had this happen to him ) , but given that it's also his final directed feature , albeit after the fact , adds to the shamefulness . Does 8 Million Ways to Die deserve a director's cut ? Maybe so , maybe not , as it stands it's a competent , mostly satisfying thriller . But we'll never know either way .
509742	453068	465624	6.0	decent enough entertainment for what you might expect	Ivan Reitman unfortunately ( today ) doesn't have the real goods on directing spectacular fantasy comedies that work for all ages and can rake in the huge bucks . It's not that he's become a bad director , but that in an age where the ' Frat pack ' grosses nearly 100 million or more at a clip with each film they put out , his kind of comedy is a near-dying breed . This being said , I was glad - if not enthralled - to see My Super Ex-Girlfriend , a pleasant diversion that gives some good moments on its one-joke premise . It boasts also some very good performances from Uma Thurman as the ultra-neurotic and high-strung Jenny Johnson aka G-Girl , who can be as nuts as she is sweet and dangerous as heroic , and even Luke Wilson playing a typical kind of role with his sort of charm and off-handed way of playing scenes . Anna Faris from Scary Movie is decent enough too , if not much to work with character-wise , as the real flame of the story . Even Eddie Izzard pops in as the ' Arch Nemesis ' of the picture . Even with a premise as catchy as the one for My Super Ex-Girlfriend , only so much is made up from it . And there are , needless to say for an Ivan Reitman comedy , some really funny moments . One of them is when Thurman's G-girl persuades the reluctant Wilson to get it on while in mid-flight up in her super-duper grasp in the sky . Even the shark bit , which can be seen countless times on the TV ads , is amusing . Unfortunately , Reitman's writer doesn't really mine enough chances for bigger laughs aside from mostly sexual gags an innuendo , and the performance by the buddy of Wilson's , played by Rainn Wilson ( no relation ) is an under-cooked character of hormonal ties that keep him tethered as the hapless advice giver that really isn't too smart or of as much enjoyment as other characters . Indeed , that might've been my biggest beef with the film was that parts of the story - which Reitman obviously cares about and does make interesting past the gags - becomes undercooked in the last act , and ultimately very transparent . It becomes somewhat of a struggle to care about these people , even amid absurd situations , which was never really a problem in other more successful Reitman films . My Super Ex-Girlfriend does provide enough good gags and humor , decently professional craftsmanship ( no quick editing , with the special effects kept grounded enough not to get too goofy or off the wall ) , and it's a fair bit of summertime fun for audiences . That it is less than the sum of its parts isn't too surprising though .
510704	453068	166843	6.0	I can't really recommend it , but I was engaged enough in it as a die-hard Romero fan	Oh the days when independent films were made and sometimes barely ever seen . That still happens to this day , but at least now there's DVD ( matter of fact that was the only way I could get to see There's Always Vanilla - it's next to impossible to find on bootleg ) . In , George A . Romero and the Latent Image , his production company that previously established itself big-time with Night of the Living Dead , decided to go a more romantic / dramatic route , as there seemed to be a possible small market for it . Unfortunately , the scriptwriter , Rudy Ricci , was haphazard and scatter-shot with his contributions , and the script was never finished until the end of filming ( it came to the filmmakers scene by scene ) , so even though there are characters to get interested in as a ' character study ' , Chris Bradley and Lynn Harris ( Ray Lane and Judith Streiner respectively ) , sometimes the dialog and situations become contrived . The main thrust of the story comes from Lynn's relationship to Chris , as Chris is a sort of man-child , who comes into her life suddenly one day after abandoning an older women he may or may not have fathered a kid with , and somehow through his constant sarcasm and lackadaisical charm that gets her into bed . But Chris , as we soon finds out , uses the wit and charms and occasional obnoxious means of talk to mask insecurities . He doesn't work , and when the opportunity comes he backs out . It all leads up to his father relaying a ' meaning ' : there's always vanilla . It's not totally incomprehensible to see why Romero , on an interview featured on the DVD , is completely assured with his feelings that it was a low-point in his career where he tried to gain more experience as a filmmaker and fell flat on his face . There is that side to the picture that is unequivocally dated , and the lack of a better budget or a means to a better structure ( particularly an ending that feels complete or make sense ) is frustrating . But a filmmaker sometimes has to feel that way about certain films , as the experience making it becomes a personal struggle whereas other times it could become a personal triumph ( he still considers Day of the Dead a favorite , mostly for the experience making it ) . Ironically though it's his own skills as a director and editor and director of photography that rises the material to a level of watchability . It's no Cassavetes - as another reviewer noted - but he treats the material with a control that wavers between late 60s early 70s exploitation film-making ( of the period , of course , with some scenes with psychedelia bits and music and pot ) , and a more grounded tone for the actors to follow . And sometimes Romero's given by Ricci a compelling scene to shoot , like when Lynn has to deal with a certain ' problem ' she may need to take care of , but decides at the last moment to run away from it . Or , of course , when Romero cuts the scenes together , sometimes around Chris's confessions to the audience about his mistakes and own feelings at certain times , which pop in at a good rhythm . Or the way he doesn't putz around with montage - often a high-quality trademark in Romero films - even when dealing with schmaltzy scenes like the quasi courtship of Chris and Lynn in a park or on a boat ( I also really liked the one liners each character traded off on one another in the park - marking the shallowness of the period ) . And the actors do bring qualities of believability to scenes that somehow work almost in spite of the flaws in the material ; Laine is actually charming and affable , carrying over similar qualities from the next collaboration with Romero in Season of the Witch , and Streiner is even better here than she was in ' Living Dead ' , as a woman who has to contend with being the mature one in a relationship where a falsity to it rings true almost every day . By the time one sees those balloons fly out of the cardboard box to the cheesy singing ( and usually there is cheesy music here ) , it's clear that this isn't Romero's finest dip into a change of pace . But even in a miscalculation there are intriguing , humorous notes touched on , and that no matter what Romero can somehow be pragmatic with his material , and chooses experimental angles in an otherwise typical low-budget effort .
509260	453068	1104733	6.0	only a little more than South Park-lite thanks to Steve Coogan	Hamlet 2 is sophomoric , satirical , stupid , trying to be smart while being stupid , and anchored by another winning go-for-broke comic turn from Steve Coogan . It's hard for me to see him doing much wrong , be it the segment with Alfred Molina in Coffee and Cigarettes , 24 Hour Party People or , most of all , Tristram Shandy . It's the biggest credit of all that he is even able to make this film directed and co-written by Andrew Fleming as watchable and occasionally clever as it is . He tries , Lord , oh how he tries to rise up this character into something really memorable , and it is . Though not too ironically while he gave the more prominent and funnier performances in Hamlet 2 his supporting turn in this month's Tropic Thunder was another reminder how brilliantly stupid that was compared to this . Perhaps it's also a difference in talent - instead of Robert Downey Jr giving the bravura comic performance of his career we get Amy Pohler in a hysterical and unsatisfying bit as an ACLU attorney and Elisabeth Shue as , well , Elisabeth Shue - but there's also a factor in the script that separates one as a modern classic and the other as more of a minor work ( if more raunchy and intentionally un-PC ) . It's about a down on his luck actor played by Coogan who's married to a drunk wife ( Catherine Keener ) who scoffs at him any chance she can and after striking out in commercial gigs now teaches pro-bono as a drama teacher at a high school . He's about to get thrown off that gig too ( unlike Max Fischer in Rushmore he can't seem to get luck putting theatrical adaptations of screen classics like Erin Brockovich ) due to budget cuts , but suddenly gets inspiration : he writes Hamlet 2 , a crude musical about a time machine , a rock ' n ' roll Jesus , and face-rape . It's in part a parody of all those goody-too-shoes feel-good movies of inspiration with the teacher leading the rag-tag group of kids into something worth their while ( Dead Poets Society is mentioned more than once in this regard ) , and as a lighter and more raw satire on celebrity and the craft of acting . Sadly , however , it's a slightly hit or miss affair ; sometimes I'm laughing a whole lot as some of the scenes and set-pieces , other times I'm rolling my eyes or lightly groaning at the obvious moments even as I know they're taken as a goof on other movies . The script was co-written by South Park writer Pam Brady , and it's worth noting that a lot of the humor is akin to that Parker / Stone creation ( there's even a character slightly akin to a Kenny , a mute girl who gets knocked about every other scene till towards the end when she SPEAKS UP in caps ) , only it lacks that really stinging wit and almost arrogance in going to the limits to offend with hilariousness . The closest she and Fleming come to this delirious attention to detail is with the actual musical as the climax , with everything from a Grease send up ( " Rock Me , Sex Me , Jesus " is my favorite ) to Elton John is used , and even then there's an inter-cutting scheme to the big brew-haha outside with protesters and firefighters and Amy Pohler screaming about who knows what . And at the center of it all is Coogan , who delivers on little things like singing poetical on a keyboard to Flashdance songs and is funny just skating on his roller skates everywhere because he doesn't have a car ; and don't get him started if he's got acid or grain alcohol in his system . It's a swell showcase for his talents , and maybe shows some promise with the high school kids , but it's also kind of a slight work . I wouldn't say it's a very good movie , but if you must rock your sexy Jesus on , or find Coogan the funniest thing around , then it's a good pit-stop for the moment .
510304	453068	825232	6.0	probably better than it has any right to be , mostly due to its star power	The Bucket List only mildly calls into the A-list of Hollywood screenwriters Justin Zackham , and it only slightly elevates Rob Reiner as a director . He's had a slump as a director for what seems like the better part of fifteen years ( oddly enough the last time the co-lead of this film , Jack Nicholson , appeared veraciously in A Few Good Men , was then ) when before that he had one of the strongest careers of any Hollywood director . With the Bucket List he's made a film that's respectable , entertaining for its time being , and about as deep as a kiddie pool . It's nowhere near as bad as North or Rumor Has it , to be sure . But there could be some tweaking to the Zackham script , little things that could make it stand out just a bit more in dealing with aspects of the drama - what could be really dark and biting to level off with the cynical , jab-in-the-ribs sense of humor to it . What we're given , basically , is two old guys who are out to ' find themselves ' in their time of dying . Ho-ho ! OK , to be fair , it is a major credit to the stars that this even works as well as it does . One is an auto mechanic ( Morgan Freeman ) and the other a billionaire ( Nicholson ) , and the two meet as sharing the same room , undergoing immense cancer treatments . Instead of undergoing " experimental " treatments after each finding out they'll be dead in at longest a year , Freeman's Carter has a hypothetical list of things he'd like to do before he dies . With Edward ( Nicholson ) , he'll do it because , of course , Edward is wealthy enough to go the limit . It's interesting then to follow along these two figures for the simple fact that they are played by two of the best leading men of their generation . Strangely , however , if anyone could be said to have the edge over the other ( all the more strangely because of how much I love the latter ) , Freeman did more with his part than Nicholson with his . This goes without saying Zackham doesn't reveal too much about Edward until late in the game , and only provides enough in the meantime for Jack to be " Jack " that we all know and love - perhaps , sad to say , too much so - while Freeman plays it touchingly , making the most out of a more well-rounded character with a few very good scenes ( i . e . him at the bar in China ) . It should be way too schmaltzy to recommend , and if you do want the kind of studio movie-making that tries its absolute hardest to tug ever so hard at your heartstrings The Bucket List it certainly is that . But what offsets what could be a totally painful ordeal with such ideal stars . But Zackham , at the end of it all , does give enough fun lines and dialog exchanges and things for Nicholson and Freeman to do that one is distracted by the fact that Reiner as a director provides typical and dull imagery to the proceedings , only wisely enough giving the breathing room for the actors in some scenes . It's cheerful to see the bickering before sky-diving or the machismo flaring up during the car race , and it's insightful to see when the two just have a quieter scene like in front of the pyramids . It's a pithy romp about men being men dying of cancer . It's neither Nicholson or Freeman's best day as real masters of the acting craft . But it wouldn't be too bad to catch again , in bits and pieces , on TV .
509980	453068	396171	6.0	fantastic production design , usually spellbinding editing . . . but the results are frustratingly uneven	I'll say it off the bat - I haven't read the book of Perfume by Patrick Suskind . But I have heard that the film is , ironic considering most directors ' claims that it was unfilmable , quite faithful to the source . I don't doubt it , as it has a literary quality all about it . From the John Hurt narration ( and even when it's not necessary or adding only bits to the psychology of the characters , it's good to have Hurt doing it ) , to the fast-paced storytelling , to the detail likely expressed in the locations and settings , it feels novelistic even when it's at it's worst ( which is , regrettably , the last twenty minutes , as Truffaut said is the most important section of a picture ) . The initial story itself , the first half of it , does spell some entertainment to come . An orphan grows up into a slave , but has somehow had since birth the incredible gift of smell , to smell everything ( yes , even in smelly old France ) , and is tempted more than ever after accidentally killing a woman one night and smelling her from head to toe . The idea of catching smell , scents of people , drives him bonkers as he later learns of perfume from a master ( Dustin Hoffman , one of the bright spots acting-wise ) that there have to be a set number of ingredients - and that special something to put it over the top . And over the top it does become ! But not before Tom ( Run Lola Run ) Twyker , cinematographer Frank Griebe ( also Run Lola Run ) , production designer Uli Hanisch , and ( surprisingly , considering his past work was with Paul W Anderson ) editor Alexander Berner create the look of the film as something worth watching for . In fact , for the latter , it sometimes is really absorbing the way the images move forward , at a clip that is a little reminiscent of Thelma Schoonmaker ( and , perhaps through that , Scorsese to a very small point ) . If looking squarely on the technical grounds , Perfume is one of the best produced out of Europe in 2006 . Yet however much Twyker and his crew - save for the music which is a befuddling mix of Popol Vuh and orchestrations for a Disney channel movie - go to lengths to make this feel real and gritty and dark , it's hard to obscure how there is , in a way , a silliness to the conceit of the character . On the one hand it is compelling to see him in his early stages , his first victim , his ' training ' ( in quotes as he doesn't need it exactly , just a little guidance ) . On the other hand , and a little more ironic considering the draw of the suspense and horror of the murders , when he starts killing it's not quite as compelling . I know there's a level of disbelief to be had , and this goes without saying that every time Jean Grenouille leaves someone ( orphan caretaker , slave owner , Hoffman's character ) that person dies . And even up until the last twenty minutes I could take that level of disbelief , and it's still a good movie . But when it comes to the climax - and Grenouille's " demise " ( from a point of view may depend on how much you take it as Christian allegory , or devil-allegory , who knows ) - it falls apart for me . It may not for some , as it's own pretentiousness might be part of the appeal - frankly there's a touch of the Passion of the Christ in the mix there as far as slow-motion melodrama goes - and some might hate it to no end . It's a flawed conclusion , though mostly cause of what has been set up before , while sometimes in the ridiculous ( so many murdered , none seen in the act , eh why not ) , feels and comes off realistic in that gritty 18th century set-up that can only come out of the poor and rich sections of French life . By the time we get the messianic image towards the end , I felt like turning off the movie - and luckily it ended . So Perfume ends up being neither a debacle nor a full-blown artistic success . I was glad to see it , and it's fairly well acted ( watch Alan Rickman as he speaks in a very low , sinister tone to Grenouille as he is dunked in the barrel of water ) , even to a point by the hollow-eyed Ben Whishaw . But it just , well . . . does not smell quite right at the end .
508266	453068	61189	7.0	a drive-in movie classic that doesn't totally succeed but has nihilistic fun	Roger Corman , though having his rightful clout as one of the pioneers of drive in movies and exploitation pictures , doesn't have a great film with The Wild Angels , but then it's not meant to be . As I watched the film , I thought of an adjective for the film that I hadn't used for one in a while - it's reckless . Like the bikers themselves that Corman and his writers are ' following ' , the film never really comes together and the parts are definitely greater than the whole . Too many scenes end up kind of flailing around with not much to do except act as filler in-between Corman's rule-of-law of their being an action / fight scene & / or scene of sex every 15 minutes . But on the other hand , as a purely drive-in movie , where people watching aren't necessarily meant to keep track of the whole picture ALL the time ( likely ' making out ' Corman must've thought ) , it doesn't break under time that much . And , sometimes , Corman is actually pretty creative and intuitive as a filmmaker . His cast is Peter Fonda ( quite similar to Easy Rider which means maybe too esoteric and contemplative to be the wild leader of the angels ) , Nancy Sinatra ( not that great , though she can fake a crying scene pretty well ) , and Bruce Dern ( in a role that actually does ask for some real ' acting ' as opposed to biker posing ) . There are also other real Angels riding about in the background , and basically the story revolves around the wounding - and later unnecessary death - of Loser ( Dern ) , who is also given a proper Biker funeral . In between there are plenty of fight scenes , some exciting moments of the men on their bikes , a few sexy , bra-clad women , and the ' squares ' being almost everyone else not an Angel . Sometimes the scenes are pretty basic , lots of generic ( even for the period ) rock and roll tunes put to the Angels riding around , and partying , though once in a while Corman actually makes it interesting . A scene that is finally quiet , for example , when Dern is getting operated on , is one of my favorites in the film ( in general his provide much of the interest ) . But for the most part , it's just the simple tale of youth who just " want to be free , to ride without getting hassled by the man . . . and we want to get loaded ! " In short , it's kind of like the fast-food equivalent of a biker-movie . It's got many ingredients , it fills you up , but it definitely isn't really ' good ' for you despite serving up what's promised ( it doesn't have that healthy portion of being cohesive in structure and with at least a little nuance ) . Though for Corman this could possibly be one of his better entries . ( Strong )
510015	453068	455590	7.0	contains both the conventions and convictions of good thrillers , with a ' tour-de-force ' performance	It would be one thing to make the pat statement ' this is worth seeing if only for Forest Whitaker as dictator Idi Amin ' . For some it will be , and in fact some may just go to see it based on the hype he's been building up in the awards season ( not that it's undeserved ) . But the director Kevin MacDonald , along with his DP Anthony Dod Mantle ( behind the modern classic as 28 Days Later ) , gives the film an edge to it that might have been lost on a technical crew less interested in getting part of the psychology into the style . In the core of the Last King of Scotland , which is purportedly based on the true story of Amin and his doctor Nicholas Garrigan ( James McAvoy ) who becomes soon an adviser and soon like a " son " in Amin's bi-polar mind , is a thriller that does thrill , and also pulls into question what it means to practically become a participant in the madness of a brutal dictatorship . Garrigan randomly picks Uganda to go to after he graduates from medical school in Scotland , tries to be a doctor where needed , but somehow becomes enveloped in the world of Amin after a chance encounter on a road-side . He becomes charmed by Amin's upfront likability and candid manner , plus his vulgar humor and promise of both peace for his people and excess in his domain ( he has three wives ) . But soon this turns to become sour when Garrigan sees the darker side to Amin - a paranoid fear-monger who can flip on a dime on his closest advisers . He knows he has to get out , but it wont be easy , at all . It's a shame then that such pungent subjects - of the towering force that is Amin , portrayed by Whitaker with a look in his eyes that always perfectly conveys what the scene should feel like , and towards the end becomes absolutely chilling in both his rage and even his amiability . Even McAvoy is able to rise to the challenge of his counterpart , as the guy who inspires more in Amin to be " Scottish " , but also becomes wayward himself . His plot line though becomes a little mired in bits that don't seem truthful ( who's to say if they are , as it's based on a book likely based on what happened ) , with his romantic asides the most unconvincing portions of the picture . The whole sub-plot with him and one of Amin's wives ( played by Kerry Washington ) becomes a little soapy , and puts such realism into the realm of near contrivance ( I also would've liked to see , aside from the one scene where Garrigan sees the pictures , the furthest extent of his murderous ways on his people ) . But when pit into the reality of Garrigan's situation , and the environment around him , it becomes a richer picture . It does have the goods with being an engrossing entertainment of course , and of the two films out now ( this and Blood Diamond ) set in turbulent Africa I'd recommend this a little more for the style and acting . That it isn't great isn't ever a fault of Whitaker , however .
509473	453068	147746	7.0	good , if not great , follow-up to Batman the animated series	Batman Beyond was described by Paul Dini as meant for " selling toys . " It goes without saying how much merchandise works into Batman - lord knows that the toys and videos and movies make more money than the comics have in general in years - but it slightly underrates the strengths in this show . As a kids program , it's often very exciting , and even as a guy now moving along in age ( i . e . 20s ) , it's recognizably a cool , if updated , Batman reboot . To also say that it's nowhere near as groundbreaking or amazing or sometimes genius as Bruce Timm's original series from the 90s is also a given ; they're out to carve some new ground here , but it's only with new variations on characters and bringing back the ' relics ' ( i . e . old Bruce Wayne , Barbara Gordon , Mr . Freeze and Bane in a couple of episodes ) on top of the new ' versions ' ( i . e . Jokerz gang , which is in no relation to the Return of the Joker movie ) . As it stands , solo episodes not dealing with that opening struggle between CEO-cum-radioactive man Derek Powers and Terry McGinnis are not always that great . Sometimes they are , in spots , and other times they're mired in predictable action , plots , and characters that come out of the stockpile of clichés that kids can gobble up like M & Ms without much afterthought . In a sense it's like Buffy the Vampire Slayer , only not quite as imaginative or funny , yet still filled with big amounts of action and cheesy one-liners and villains that spring out of nightmares of high school and craziness . That's part of it , anyway ; as the series goes along some of the themes start to run deeper - not least of which Bruce Wayne's role as surrogate father / mentor to Terry - and occasionally it's even poignant . Most of the time , it is what it appears to be : Saturday morning fodder that is a step above The Batman series of late and is just a bit more than the ' toys ' angle .
509933	453068	409182	7.0	it's action and ' what's coming round the bend ' entertainment , nothing more or less	Poseidon is based on a novel , technically , although most will associate it with the original film The Poseidon Adventure from 1972 , unseen by me . What I do know whenever someone mentions it is that Shelley Winters is very memorable in it ( and actually when they refer to her career they bring up that film or Lolita ) . But I knew basically that this was your standard Hollywood-sized blockbuster with a man who could either hit just well enough or miss ( Wolfgang Peterson ) . What he provides by way of being director serves this material more than the lackluster Troy from two years ago . Here he's in his element doing something very elemental , however a lot of the time abandoning logic like the several passengers from the ship . It's popcorn entertainment on a scale that I enjoyed for what it was , while noticing that the investment in the characters was only up to a very small point . Then again , I'm not seeing this film for character development , and the screenwriter Mark Protosevich knows this so he just gives unpretentiously what's needed - the main cast who are all just ' types ' ( i . e . Russell is ex fireman turned mayor , Dreyfuss an architect , Josh Lucas a natural leader , and various female roles of equal strength and shame ) . While I can't completely recommend the film like I would other more successful big-budget ' disaster ' films , I can recommend it perhaps more than others , and unlike the other three big films from this month it doesn't necessarily kid itself too much or go for a way too muddled storyline . And it is actually best to see the film on an IMAX screen ( its effectiveness may actually be lost somewhat once its on TV ) , where the actual first turning point of the ship getting tossed over by the ' rare ' wave is almost worth the price of admission alone for its visual prowess and , indeed , excitement . The rest of the picture is just a series of cliffhangers ( some more literally than others ) , and a lot of running , swimming , ( some ) drowning , and heavy-handed dialog when need be . Peterson is also smart enough here , unlike with Troy , not to overstay the welcome with the material . It's compact enough to be enough of a vehicle of danger and with the technical side all intact , while the characters only get testy up to a point . Some of the early scenes are , of course , too predictable ( even if Dreyfuss's romantic side seems a little displaced and unnecessary ) , as one just wants things go forward with the action . Luckily , on that end , in the tradition of bubble-headed ( pun intended ) thrillers with all the elements of a matinée serial , it's not bad .
511002	453068	105323	7.0	Longish , overrated , but watchable	Scent of the Woman has a story , but luckily ( mainly since it's not the greatest ) , it sticks to it's dialog and actors . Brief plot summary goes as this : a prep kid needs money so he takes a job looking after a blind old guy who lives in a cottage with his family . If that was it , this movie wouldn't have even gotten off the ground , but then something interesting happens : the old guy is quite the classic ( bleep ) . And this Lieutenant Colonel is played by Al Pacino in the ' bravado ' style of his abilities , his abilities being of his instincts , even if it is not at all one of his best performances . Too much of it is over-emphasis , close to being not even a complete person , even in the strongest moments . It's almost as if the Oscar to Pacino was more for his career up till then , not even for this film necessarily . Slade leads the young man ( Chris O'Donnel ) on a coming of age odyssey in NYC . If you take this part of the film ( like taking the entire 90 minutes of Tom Hanks on Cast Away island and sea ) , you have something quite intriguing at times , but the film also has some un-needed stuff left over from preppie-school message-movie land , and it doesn't work at all . Still , Pacino does what he can , and some supporting actors are good .
510413	453068	810895	7.0	not quite as sweet as the movie , but pretty darn close - should definitely appease fans of the comic book	Hellboy : Sword of Storms is in the quality of animation no more or less the standard one might see on the average program on Adult Swim ( Cartoon Network , of course ) . Which means it's always eye-catching , if only on a kind of wacky 2-D level that is left in the dust in these days of cinema going the way of CGI . What makes Sword of Storms significant , if only in parts , is that Mignola , Del-Toro and company start to introduce a lot more surreal imagery than was seen in the first theatrical feature . Hellboy gets swept up this time in a pretty convoluted ( or just seems that way , turns out it's actually painfully simplistic in terms of the Japanese folklore played out as drama ) , with monsters and demons all under the control of a sword that if broken spells doom for the Earth . As usual he does his job well at whacking around creatures like a big turtle / lizard creature , and at the start even tackles a big beast that , until Liz - as kind of a running un-funny gag - blazes fire all over the place till the job's done - but that's not all . This time the supernatural is accentuated in the world of what is a cross between Noh theater and , well , the average Hellboy comic-book . It doesn't matter either way how much the writers and producers researched Japanese history and creatures and such ( though I'm sure they did their share ) . What matters is how effective it all is , and in the end Hellboy is also a dark comedy - how is it to see Hellboy , after spending an uncomfortable night with some unpleasant Japanese fellows , to awake to find that they're heads have been disconnected from their bodies , and are attacking him viciously ! It's even better , of course , to see the fate of the heads , pleading Hellboy to tell where their bodies lay . I also liked the little asides with the talking fox , the old lady , and of course the big-ass demons , who allow one or two quips from Hellboy as he has to tackle them any way possible . On top of the fighting heads , there's a crazy possessed researcher , which in and of itself could make an interesting issue in the comics . Only the conventions of the story ( the psychic has been seen in countless permutations of the annoying side character who's only there for moments of sudden exposition for another side character who isn't as annoying ; plus the ending with the Japanese ghosts going through a redemption moment ) drag the film really downward . Aside from that , it's from cartoony viewing , and it should appeal to anyone who's somewhat a fan , and mandatory for fans of the books ; lord knows there's only so many times we can see Hellboy in the whirlwind of samurai dreams .
508674	453068	109322	7.0	moves like a good little bebop number , but only hints at what would come	At this point , I wager , Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson weren't entirely sure how their Bottle Rocket feature would turn out . As a means of getting support for it they made this short film which won over James L . Brooks at Sundance and got them a movie deal at Columbia pictures . Their plan worked . . . except that their short film had only the smallest of substance - heavy on style , of course , even in the grittiest possible for anything by Wes Anderson - and they spent more than a year or so writing and rewriting the feature until they got it to where it worked , brilliantly . So , as someone who loves the 1996 Bottle Rocket , I have to say that this one was just alright . But alright in that sense that does get you excited about a couple of things . For one thing the Wilson brothers , however airy their delivery , already have an interesting rapport going on , and certain scenes are identical to how it came out in the feature such as the robbery of the house , or of the shooting of the cans with the guns ( the Charlie Brown music is an especially funny and awesome touch ) . I also liked how they introduced the book-store into the story , how the bits and pieces of visual information were kind of " stolen " shots probably taken when no one was looking in the aisles and around the corners . It overall is something slight , but it works for a 13 minute short with a sort of abrupt ending .
509843	453068	1175491	7.0	Bush's " Greatest Hits "	Some will say - actually a lot have said - that Oliver Stone's new film on the public history of George W . Bush , the man and the 43rd President , will be slanted or with scenes that show the clear bias of the filmmaker . What happens in W . is that it is and it isn't a sign of bias . Unlike with Nixon , who was a complex man and could be treated in a different way , Bush is actually fairly straightforward as a person , as a leader , as a son , as a ' rehabilitated ' servant of the Lord . The portrayal of Bush is , actually , is not unfair , but in the process it shows the George W . Bush to be exactly what he is to any and all audiences , and this makes it more interesting and ( somewhat more ) challenging . If you feel like Bush should be impeached and / or ' taken out ' for all of the atrocities upon atrocities he with his administration has committed in the past eight years , you'll think it's not enough shown in the film . If you're on the other side of the coin , whoever you might be , it's kind of cruel and lampoon-like . To me , it's a finely stated psychological horror story with gallows-humor . Does this mean that W . is a great film ? No , it's not . Stone indulges from time to time in the kind of stylistic choices that veer close to being a TV movie - nowhere near as much or as sappy as the Hallmark-channel spread World Trade Center , but with a couple of obvious music choices - and the criticism put on the movie that there's nothing really new that those reasonably informed about Bush's past and his first term is not completely unwarranted . But , again , there is the expectation going in that this will be the be-all-end-all of lambasting , or on the flip-side that it's too soon an analysis of a man still ( not too arguably ) crippling the country away in his last months in office . What Stone has done , occasionally brilliantly , is compile a Greatest-Hits of Bush trivia and scenes that are either spot-on to how they likely played out or are based very accurately on what is at the date known about what happened behind closed doors with Bush and Cheney and Rove and company . On top of this is a story of , in a famous-movie comparison , what would happen if Fredo Corleone got the chance to be a mob boss while his disapproving father was still alive and smarter brother got more respect ( it's not beyond comprehension to hear the echo of " I can run things , I'm smart ! " from Godfather 2 in certain scenes with George and his father ) . While this could possibly fall into , as just a movie , into cliché , Stone and his casting director have , not entirely without coincidence , compiled the best casted Stone picture since 1995's Nixon . Josh Brolin is clearly now on the A-list following last year's mix and match of thrillers ( Grindhouse , American Gangster , No Country ) , and his performance solidifies his reputation as an actor so convincing and in touch with the not-quite transformation of George W . Bush that he makes him , if not entirely sympathetic , understandable and human and not some complete villain . There's also a gallery of who's-who in the acting pool : James Cromwell , Richard Dreyfuss ( exceptional ) , Jeffrey Wright , Ellen Burstyn , Thandie Newton , Toby Young , even Rob Corddry from the Daily Show , all of them are spectacular in their parts , adding interest to scenes that require presence , strength , and from time to time nuance and care in finding that line between playing a character and parody ( which , actually , Newton verges into a few times ) . It's also been said that W . is actually a funny movie , maybe one of Stone's few outright comedies . The trailer and the TV commercials have made this to look so , and I laughed a bunch of times at them in that context since they were in skit-format . In the context of the film , where the weight of very current history and wars still being waged and blunder and horror accumulating , a lot of the humor is either by a quick goof or what comes off like , as said , gallows humor . This could in fact be a crazy American Bunuel picture if it weren't true ; it's the kind of dark bourgeois horror-comedy in a sense that you laugh almost out of exasperation , but at the same time stuff one might find funny out of context ( i . e . choking on a pretzel ) is treated with an amount of actual gravitas . It's not that I couldn't see how it's maybe too simple a task to show a lot of what we already know - the power-hungry conflict in the administration , the Bush / Bush Jr conflict , the dangerous change-up from all alcohol to all Jesus - but at the same time it's revealed in the best kind of pop-melodrama , as a serious story of a man who is , in all actually , not at all complicated . It won't be a popular movie by any stretch , but it took some guts to present it as such .
509781	453068	963178	7.0	fairly smart and intriguing , but wouldn't be as powerful without that set piece . . .	Tom Twyker picks his projects with an eye for something that will bring him in on something really significant , even if it's just ( or maybe because of ) one sequence . Previously we saw his adaptation of Perfume which had that incredibly strange and erotica and absurd climax with the orgy in the arena . This time we get a gigantic shoot-out set-piece at the Guggenheim museum in New York . What leads up to this exactly I wont say , not because I would be too spoiling but because it's almost inconsequential . From the lead-up to this , which is just suspenseful enough , all the way through the execution of all of these rounds fired off , hundreds and hundreds of bullets in the walls of one of the most well-renown museums in the world , Twyker makes such a remarkable sequence that it stands up to some of the best I've seen in years . If nothing else , it can be counted as an equal ( only this time with a straight face ) with Clive Owen's previous vehicle Shoot em Up . As for the rest of the movie . . . it's good , but not totally altogether remarkable . It's an unraveling-conspiracy story where a whole network of international bankers are using tons of money in under-the-table arms deals with some " nefarious " elements . This also leads to things like assassinations , and with determined and ragged Interpol agent Louis Salinger ( Owen ) and a Manattan DA ( Watts ) on the trail . Some of it you have to pay attention to closely - it's one of those not-really spy like thrillers - but at least it pays off in some satisfying conventional ways . Twyker can handle suspense pretty well , as well as having a couple of strong leads and a couple of notable supporting players like Armin Mueller-Stahl . We get wrapped up in this story of corruption and worldwide espionage , even up until an ending that is average in its bittersweet tenacity . But at the same time it doesn't really stay with the viewer - that is unless you're affected by the recent disasters going on in Wall Street . But if nothing else , truly , all you movie fans out there , just watch the film for that Guggenheim scene . It is , for lack of a worse or better cliché , a knock-your-socks-off sequence .
507985	453068	106029	7.0	three filmed plays with equal amounts of character insight , good acting , and run-of-the-mill moments	Three half-hour episodes were produced , two from David Lynch as director and Barry Gifford as writer , one from some random guy , James Signorelli , I never heard of ( though , according to IMDb , directed an Elvira movie , and surprisingly helmed Easy Money ) , each set in a hotel room in a particular year in time : The first segment , Tricks , set in 1969 , is a story of a man ( Harry Dean Stanton ) right about to get some from a stoned prostitute , who gets visited at that moment by an old white-bearded friend with some dark past history . The acting is good all around , particularly from Stanton during a monologue about his first sexual encounter . But it also doesn't really lead much anywhere , even through touches of Lynch's usual twists ( the appearance of the ' friend ' , the final twist that does cleverly wrap around old relationship ties ) . It also tries to be funny , and it isn't , which makes it a little awkward when the subtle wit doesn't work . ( ) The second segment , Getting Rid of Robby , set in 1992 , is like some slightly sleazier , less witty episode of Sex and the City ( if you can imagine that ) , with very lame would-be-clever dialog , and the only redeeming aspect being Griffin Dunne playing a man who's breaking up with a woman who usually ' takes care ' of him when he comes by during business trips . Not sure why it was here , even if Badalamenti puts in a groovy jazz song over material that isn't worth it ; it's not necessarily a horrible short , but it has no real entertainment value except for people who can't distinguish fake-feminist-trash from quality product , and it is a significant drop in comparison to the other two shorts . ( ) Blackout , 1937 - Probably the closest that Lynch has come to doing full-on Bergman , via Gifford's script , by ding very simply shot but emotionally complex character studying . Crispin Glover plays a small-town guy who stays in the same hotel room from the other two shorts with his love , played by Alicia Witt , who's sort of slow and affected mind-wise , but has a lot to say about Chinese fish and seeing things like their future children . Witt has a look like the classic Bergman actresses , and the dialog even goes further than Bergman , maybe back to Ibsen , in capturing the tense but always powerfully human tradition of characters who are disconnected from one another , but wanting to be close as possible , through revelations in behavior and stark details . Glover , in a rare instance , plays a guy who is the straight character ( straight as possible anyway ) . In the Barry Lyndon-esquire candle-lit lighting , Lynch makes this all so spare that it seems like the farthest thing removed from an quagmire like Inland Empire . But in its own way , Lynch is experimenting just as much in getting inside the nature of a character's psychology , and it's refreshing to see him let the actors find their own beats in the performances .

509536	453068	362227	7.0	a good piece of humanist comedy , nothing more , nothing less	The Terminal is sort of like a a Frank Capra tale spun into 21st century America , with it a sort of divide between the naive innocence of ordinary men , and the cynicism of the outside world . It also is akin to E . T . as being about an outsider who comes into a strange situation , gets befriended , but in reality is really all on his own on his quest . There is a sweetness to the film that works well , even when all plausibility at times goes right out the window in return to try and make shamelessly entertaining product . Steven Spielberg here has a film that is meant , in a way , as THE film for airline movies , as it can be geared for kids and adults , though like airplanes its not always the best experience . Tom Hanks is genuine for a lot of the performance , and at least a little fascinating , as Viktor Navorski , a refugee from a country made up for the sake of the film ( though , apparently , his accent is for real ) . He's stuck in the airport , not able to leave into New York City or back to war-torn home . So , he sticks around , he meets the janitor , he runs into a emotionally weary flight attendant ( Catherine Zeta-Jones , not the best she's done but cute enough ) , and gets to become familiar company around the huge terminal . It's a huge place , with adversiting that almost makes it like a insular Times Square . During this Viktor goes from befriending the workers , to befriending the attendant , which leads to some romantic interest - or maybe not . Who knows with Viktor's true intentions to stick around for his chance to get into New York City . The reason he ends up telling is , actually , one of the most touching moments in the film , maybe even in the better of Spielberg films . This isn't , however , overall anything great in the filmmaker's cannon . Maybe not a ' minor ' work , but it's often with too much whimsey . Or maybe not ; it is a film that is meant as a crowd-pleaser , or a heartwarmer , but at times isn't too sure how to balance between some of the believability the script needs at times ( i . e . why is the focus sometimes squarely on Navorski , when its a security station meant to focus on everyone at the airport ) . The visual styling is impressive , with some cool camera sweeps and tracks in the immense set . But it doesn't add up to anything that marks it as a great film . It also doesn't hold up as well as Spielberg's other films on repeat viewings ; on a first go-around it is sheerly entertainment , but once seen again certain scenes bring out some groans . It might be even more enlightening or fun for kids , as it is on that sort of E . T . level . And Hanks ' performance , which only shows some dimension towards the last twenty minutes , is good enough , though could've been more . I guess in short I'm saying that the Terminal is reccomendable , especially as a ' date ' movie of sorts , though I wouldn't say to start off with it as the first Spielberg ever . That being said , Kumar Palau ( the janitor character , also a Wes Anderson regular ) , is the best thing about the movie .
509332	453068	913958	7.0	mostly a ' fly-on-the-wall ' approach to the former President . . .	. . . but despite some of Jonathan Demme's techniques to making Man from Plains , which are either interesting ( the skewed camera on the television screens , the title cards listed in big font above the locations in some scenes ) or off-putting ( the usage of music is overbearing ) , his movie should be called the proverbial ' fair and balanced . ' There are few issues in the world that ignites the firestorm of debate like Israel and Palestine land and peace talks ( the abortion issue is right up there ) . Jimmy Carter placed himself into the pit of controversy a year and a half ago with his book " Palestine : Peace , Not Apartheid " , and director Demme does his best to reveal not simply Carter defending his points on various interview shows and programs , but to get the other side's voice as well . Carter isn't let off very easily , and rightfully so . But had Demme gone too far either way in depicting the reaction to the book , then the documentary would get damaged by the effect . This might make Man From Plains seem slightly ' safe ' , but its strongest points are just revealing , without pushing a whole lot of stylistic fervor in the way , this man in his complexity , conflicts , resolve , and in his comfortable position as about as well-respected a ex-President one could ask for . He has a lot to boast about with some of his past accomplishments ( some which we might forget as what he might have not done ) , but a lot of his output and speeches and very concise answers are based on experience . It's easy to pin down Carter as he's labeled - anti-Semitic , plagiarist - without either reading his book ( s ) or seeing what is really going on past the veneer of the media's depiction . Just seeing the interviewees ( with some exceptions ) repeating the named " apartheid " for incisive affect is enough to see what can be taken out of context . Does this mean that Man From Plains reveals everything that could be about Carter on this book tour with the amount of depth one might hope for with an ex-president ? Maybe not . But for what it's worth , Demme delivers two hours of potent coverage , and even creates a narrative around his detractors / protesters ( i . e . rabbis / Dershowitz / Brandeis ) that adds a little weight to what would otherwise be Demme's equivalent to Moore's the Big One . As a portrait and a compact look at a hot-button issue , it's very good if not mind-expanding .
509048	453068	82357	7.0	great on imagery , but some of the actual story is . . . lost on me	For sixteen minutes Czech animator and filmmaker Jan Svankmajer does his job well with getting a real terror and doom and gloom and deconstruction of the house of Usher , one of those quintessential spots of horror of Poe . In just watching the images go by and the stop-motion utilized in creative and unexpected ways involving the house and walls and pools of water and mud , it's amazing work . But the problem for me was in the actual translation of the story itself . Perhaps it's being only most familiar with English , so with the DVD subtitles going by at a quick clip that it's hard to keep up with keeping an eye on all of these dark visions put on the screen . That there's also a complete lack of any actors ( unless one counts a sole raven among the cast ) is also a deterrent since the story features all of these characters decomposing along with the damned house itself . It's an expressionist experiment , somewhat reminiscent of parts of Last Year at Marienbad , but it's only successful in part because of the director's dedication to the imagery . It's great pictures put to a so-so execution of " story " if there is much of one at all ; maybe I'll learn Czech one say and it'll appear better .
509110	453068	491587	7.0	goes from being really stupid to some kind of brilliance . . . and then stupidity again	If you asked me what compelled R Kelly to make Trapped in the Closet , I wouldn't the foggiest clue . Maybe it was a call from Jesus , or some higher power that only comes to people whilst on the heaviest of psychotropics . But whatever it was , this is a work where you can never be completely sure whether or not Kelly was serious or not with what he was going ( in some interviews he takes himself perhaps far too seriously than someone with his reputation ever should ) . He absurdly takes the angle of infidelity to one crazy step after another , until we're met with a very scary notion of a midget in a cop's cabinet . Did I mention the music ? Yes , there is , of course , God awful music that doesn't vary in the slightest for the entire 45 minute running time ( filled with sounds of droplets and , well , you'll have to hear it for yourself in all cringe-worthy glory ) . Everything is sung by Kelly , playing over all the parts , and it becomes clear very quickly this is some kind of vanity project taken to a whole other level . First we have the man himself , played by Kelly , trapped in a closet of his mistresses , then there's the mistress's husband comes home , THEN the husband's man mistress , followed by R's wife , then . . . Should I keep going on , or will it kill the suspense ? How much you enjoy this series , basically , depends on how much you can take R Kelly singing out a wretched soap opera , like some Z-grade director with aspirations to be legit , and at times the circumstances not making any sense whatsoever . In fact , I probably did deep down really dislike this series , but somehow I couldn't stop watching , and laughing my dumbfounded head off . I applaud R Kelly for this achievement , but against all my better reasoning .
509524	453068	126250	8.0	rather sweet ; left me with a smile when I first saw it	One might call Cookie's Fortune a ' minor ' effort from Robert Altman , a filmmaker who once commented that each film " is all part of the same picture " , or rather one long movie with bits and pieces making up a career whole . But it has enough going for it through its very competent cast and interesting script to keep it afloat from being the kind of small film little old ladies might watch on TV during the day . In that sense it isn't as ' heavy ' as some of Altman's other work . It is also cool enough to treat the subject of a mystery around a suicide with enough humanity to make some scenes smile-worthy . Considering some of the darker elements in the script , Altman depicts this to the point where - get this - Cookie's Fortune is sometimes shown on the HBO family channel ! Is it really a kid's film ? I'm not sure , but it isn't work for only one age group - its appeal from its cast of a collective of small towners is appealing to most in the audience . That the cast - Glenn Close , Liv Tyler , ( especially ) Charles S . Dutton , even Chris O'Donnell - gels and plays some of the dialog sincerely even when its meant to not be taken seriously at all , is a credit to the filmmaker . That it also might not be quite as memorable as some of the director's major films is and is not a fault . It is a fault because the subject matter is sort of stuck in a certain genre realm . It is not because the subject mater is also very much more intelligent than would be expected at times . I was also fond of certain scenes and interactions with the actors , the rhythm of it all , like early on with Dutton and the actress Patricia Neal who plays the old lady . I also really like the climax . So it's a good work about the rumblings and eccentricities of a small town , the good in people as well as the lesser parts , and parts of greed and death seen through a light that is not aiming for anything ' cheap ' , so to speak .
510450	453068	118771	8.0	" It could happen to you " , the tag-line reads : not quite , but it is a white-knuckled ride all the way	Jonathan Mostow , before he went on to helm the big-budget U-571 and the even bigger budgeted Terminator 3 , brought out this taut little thriller and cemented a reputation he's yet to really live up to ( though some would disagree about that ) . His film has that tag-line , but it's not entirely accurate , even though it has a very familiar and eerily recognizable threat at the core : the outsiders coming in to a territory that is very close knit and practically inbred , where one wrong step could cost you and / or your loved ones lives . In this case , Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan are the married couple caught in the cross-hairs of kidnapping , blackmail , and ultimately vengeance . They're moving from Massachusets to San Diego , and driving on through the desert they get side-swiped by a car , then later on after a near-altercation at a pit-stop , they move on only for the couple's car to breakdown . Help comes in the form of a trucker , who offers help for to drive the wife to get a tow-truck . No need for the truck , anyway , because the car didn't have much wrong with it . . . but what about the wife , Amy ? From there on in , Mostow takes Breakdown into the realm of paranoid thriller , then into just full-on chase / action / revenge / chase again picture . One might wonder if there could be a more noirish quality to it if the wife actually left for a reason other than abduction , though the path that Mostow takes the story is fine as it is . He keeps things simple in the story sense , with elements of the Western thrown in , but also makes it very much character-based as well . Russell's performance as Jeff Taylor is kind of the opposite of his recent turn as Stuntman Mike in Grindhouse : starting off as the average-Joe who tries to be polite , albeit from a yuppie background , he gets put to the test by the enormity of the situation , and finally becomes a real take-no-prisoners hero . Towards the very end it almost reaches the point of being TOO much of hitting over the head with payback , and there are little things regarding the nature of Red Barr ( JT Walsh , great villainous presence in a real sinister , calm way ) and his ties to the town as to whether or not things are really as controlling as they might be ( i . e . the bank scene , which is perfectly acted , though not entirely feasible in the paranoid sense ) . But all this aside , what Breakdown remains ten years after is a competent , un-pretentious thrill-ride where the dialog is never too heavy , the action is packed with real stunts and few special effects , and some of the brighter moments for Russell in recent years ( or rather , the last ten ) . It knows what it is , and has the professional temerity of a cult effort .
509044	453068	66214	8.0	rock stars , gangsters , sex , drugs , suits , blood , psychedelia - all in a day's work	To say Performance is " dated " is about on the mark , if not understating it . It's a psychedelic trip into the two bellies of the underworld : organized crime ( not the Italian kind , more-so the rough Anglo-Saxon father of the likes in Guy Ritchie's movies ) and the swinging , rock ' n ' roll drug-addled bunch that first saw proper cinematic light in Blowup . But somehow Douglas Cammell and Nicholas Roeg pull off what should be just weird poppycock as only derelicts from Andy Warhol and Tim Leary's bunch could concoct into a piece of half pop art and half just , I don't know what . Roeg , I think , hovers more over the production than Cammell , which is just an assumption based solely on Roeg's other films , which , in fact , bear a great deal of resemblance to Performance's impressionistic take on time and setting and mood and a rhythm that seems to be all inside of his head . Whatever happened in the two years this was shelved by Warners in the editing room was probably all for the better ( or for the worse depending on your perspective ) . It's certainly a helluva lot more substantial than your common hippie-exploitation flick . The story runs not very deep , which is fine . Chas ( James Fox , perfect for this slightly cool , slightly psycho part ) is a full-time gangster running for an a-hole of a boss who thinks Chas goes too far with the execution of his duties ( i . e . shaving a guy to make a point while burning his car ) . When Chas gets paid a visit by some dudes looking to rough him up , the bloke has got to split fast so as to not get the in the wrath . He hears about a pad that could be a good bet to hold up in , not a hotel but just a room in the basement level of a ' flat ' . In it are Turner ( Mick Jagger ) , and a couple of ladies who live with this retired pop-star who's surrounded himself with a host of psychedelic paraphernalia and regalia : Eastern design , incense and candles , and of course the drugs . Soon Chas gets into this scene , albeit it's not in a form of exploiting the subject matter like " hey , you're square , join us , drop some acid , get high , expand your mind , etc " . On the contrary , there's almost a tone to the proceedings that is somewhat critical of this place and time , where there's total abandon of the rest of civilization and a total adherence to a controlled chaos and escapism ( or enlightenment , take your pick ) with drugs . This almost in spite of the style of the picture , Roeg's superlative camera-work as he makes his compositions into forms that look like they're not of this common movie world : close-ups merge into wide-shots , the folds of menace coming around like the cutaways to the trial early in the picture where shots seem subliminal , deranged , even satirical . But nothing beats how the editing works , which aside from Woodstock was the best editing in a movie in 1970 . Even for Roeg , who's reputation is built by his stand as an iconoclast in this arena , he makes this structure like one sees memory , association with images , thoughts , moods , colors , beauty and horrors and other madness , all through cuts and such ( just watch how he splices in the gangsters splashing the room with blood , or the mushroom shots , which seem like they influenced some shots in Magnolia ) . And let's not forget Jagger , shall we ? He goes between actually delivering a performance , so to speak , and being what one imagines Jagger , from his outlandish and sensationalized persona in the Rolling Stones , to be just regularly . He's not worried about looking glammed , or even like he's a girly with his long hair and makeup and sensual attitude , but any moment he's on screen , alongside an already good Fox and fellow cut and luscious ladies , it's hard to take his eyes off him . This goes without saying his character is sort of meant to create a lot of strange mischief , and sometimes he trails the film off further from any coherency than it already has as some experimental piece of would-be agitprop . But damned it all to bloody hell if it isn't a showstopper when as if in the midst of some Big Lebowski hallucination he becomes clean-cut ( or as clean-cut as Jagger can get ) , and ' performs ' " Turner's Song " , with an incredible beat like a lost Stones track , put to a scene filmed still in step with the rest of the movie , but great as a stand-alone effort . As mentioned , it IS dated , even with its stylistic influence on future film and filmmakers . This is its only main drawback from what is otherwise a daring act of avant-garde treatment of would-be genre material ( gangster holding up after a botched job , other gangsters on his trail , et all ) . It is , at least , a happening , and it freaks me out !
509192	453068	400525	8.0	Harlold Ramis proves he can cook up a well-directed neo-noir . .	I didn't walk out of The Ice Harvest feeling like I had been illuminated to something in art that I hadn't seen before , like it was any sort of great film . But I did know that I saw a work by a typically above-the-belt genre director , Harold Ramis , and that it served its purpose well . I didn't quite know what I'd get with the film , walking in thinking it was a dark comedy . It was , however I also realized that if the cursing and nudity / sex and ( some ) stylized violence were cut out ( and filmed in black and white of course ) this could've filled a double bill with This Gun For Hire . As it is the film takes a couple of cool twists and turns , and stays true to its sometimes cynical but not very manipulative ideals . The story takes some of the boiled down notes from those hard-edged , stylistically shot films of the 40's and 50's . John Cusack being the " average Joe " down on his luck , looking for a way out with some stolen money ( albeit with a conflicted past ) . Billy Bob Thornton as his partner in crime . Connie Nielson as the ' femme fatale ' of the story . And with others like Oliver Platt as the brash comic relief , and solid character actors like Mike Starr and Randy Quaid as roughnecks . They're given a good script with some occasionally odd dialog and scenes , but work up well the atmosphere of a cold , wet Christmas Eve , with strip clubs , booze , with a violent undercurrent . I almost wonder if the novel the film is based on has the ' old-school ' illustration on the cover like pulp noir paperbacks . Along with Ramis delivering some unobtrusive direction , and sometimes flourishes of style that marks him better than others in his field , he has a cast playing to their types ( or against ? ) without much in the way . Cusack at times under-plays , or plays without a mis-step , with his paranoia and conflicting personality in tow ; Thornton gives a couple of really big laughs at times ( of course in the darkest ways possible ) with his shady character . And whenever Nielson came on the screen , with the light pointed at the eye level mostly , she filled in her role in fine standing within her traditional kind of archetype . It is a bit of a bleak film at times , with a rather peculiar way to make its catharsis ( and happily unconventionally so , I think ) . But that it remains entertaining up until near the end ( and quite a nifty little ending , albeit knowable ) is a credit to that this kind of movie exists right now in the theaters . It's definitely the antidote to all this already brimming ' holiday cheer ' . In short , as a pre-Christmas Christmas movie , it's best out there now ( at least for a particular moviegoer ) .
510207	453068	373074	8.0	about as fun as it sounds , though know what you're getting if you're a " serious " martial arts movie fan	I was talking with a friend of mine , much more into martial arts movie than me , who didn't like Kung-Fu Hustle because of the way it went about showing the fights , and even for its goofy humor being too broad . While I could understand the latter part - everyone's got their own sense of humor ( unless if someone's got none , which is dangerous ) - the former puzzled me . What does someone expect , for example , after seeing the trailer ? If anything , director Stephen Chow is successful most in making a decidedly non-serious martial arts movie . It almost reminds me of my youth seeing the Ninja Turtles fight - there too was martial arts , sometimes with well choreographed sequences with real martial-arts fighters fighting in the costumes . But , like that , Kung-Fu Hustle gets it right in being completely unpretentious entertainment . It's a comedy in the tradition of vaudeville and Looney Tunes , with specks of Tarantino , the Marx Brothers ( yes , also vaudeville , but on a different plane ) , and with characters that are left to be , of course , cartoonish , but not characters that are too cruel or unlikeable either . Take the landlady of the establishment that the bulk of the picture takes place . She's played by Wah Yuen as the ultimate bad-ass lady you don't want to mess with on the wrong beat . Namely because of her look , which is that of having been going too long at what she does to take any lip or disruption for her customers . But then when trouble comes her way , she then reveals herself as a screaming force to be reckoned with . And all the while it's done with a wink to the audience , but taken seriously in its own comic-book logic . Chow also acts in the film as well as co-writing it , as Sing , someone who wants to join up with the mob ' the Axe gang ' , but doesn't quite cut it - at least at first it seems . In the midst of this is a romantic sub-plot involving a girl he once knew whom he had to leave behind , and when this is rekindled it strikes up some extra ambivalence , and a little strife between him and his best friend ( Bone , played as a deadpan idiot by Chi Chung Lam ) . This all leads up to a show-stopping finale where Sing finally has to step up to a certain gargantuan challenge against his evil opponent . It's not necessarily a great comedy , as sometimes it starts to show how goofiness can backfire in a couple of scenes . Plus the romantic sub-plot , while very knowing of its own satirical place from kung-fu movies past , is still a little unnecessary at times . But overall it's the kind of film that I would recommend to non kung-fu movie fans ; if you're expecting a work that takes its fights and stunts seriously like my friend did , look elsewhere . But if you want something that takes a grab-bag of ideas and tosses them altogether to become something original , this is the comedy to check out . It's visual effects go along with the tone of the comedy at most times , like a super-fast chase down a road by two of the characters . And even more " serious " fights like the one between the landlady and her husband against the Ax-thugs at night , still has that air of a battered , supernatural martial-arts tongue placed firmly in cheek . It is , for lack of a better critical term , a gas practically from start to finish .
510126	453068	21576	8.0	the sights ( no sounds ) of Nice ; a little aimless , but captivating	If you're not awake for it A Propos de Nice could be a little boring , or just a little tiresome . There's no real specific ' point ' to the visual , silent documentary that is Jean Vigo's first film , though what is and what isn't shown does strike some interest , along with some other miscellaneous images . It starts off with a spellbinding ( and for the time revolutionary ) image though , of the city of Nice seen from an angle high above in a plane . From there Vigo shows the upper class life , the vicariousness , the fun ( driving cars , swimming in the ocean , going to nice restaurants , dancing ) , and then the film ends with a strange mix of images of smoke and fire and smokestacks and people laughing in close-up . The best thing about this film , which doesn't run too long , is that there's a free-form approach to getting the city . It's part of what were called the ' city symphony ' documentaries , where filmmakers just took there cameras around the city , getting images that delighted , or shocked , them . The film goes by with some strange camera moves , some low-angle perspectives of women doing the ' can-can ' , and more smiling . But probably the most provocative ( and my favorite ) image of the film is when there is a woman's body on a chair , we see her in different pieces of clothing , until she's nude . Is this surrealist , or just experimenting in form ? It's not like a Bunuel film because it's more about getting the scenery and shapes of the buildings in Nice than fing with the audience . But on the other hand , there is a mix of Freudian qualities to the film , as were in a few independent filmmakers at the time . It's both exhilarating and a little dull - with the wrong soundtrack ( I saw it with a common baroque score ) its interest swings depending on the moment . If I can find it , I'd watch it again , especially after seeing more of Vigo's works .
510291	453068	112913	8.0	a messy movie , but not a mess , this is a film with an attention to its method of its unconventional style	Wong Kar Wai doesn't play by the rules , and those who respond positively to his films wouldn't want it any other way . While he's recently gone a little more measured and controlled with style ( relatively speaking ) with In the Mood for Love and 2046 , it's mostly in that he's now using things like dollies and steadi-cams . Looking at Chungking Express and , particularly , Fallen Angels , he reveals himself as a filmmaker total in trust with a style that in other hands would be simply amateurish . His camera , led on by Christopher Doyle , follows along these characters like in a slightly feverish documentary , with the accompanied narration adding the emphasis on inner thoughts and details . It's a crime drama , but it's also a fresh way to look at material that has a little bit of quirk , a heap-load of attitude , and at least a good lot of romance , or the lack of it or the pining for it with these characters . It's equally sweet and rough-edged , like an adorable motorcycle . For plot , there's not much : two male characters , one is a hit-man who's starting to feel the pressure of his job ( ironically , he describes it as being a good one early on as " I'm a lazy person . I like people to arrange things for me " ) , and breaks off from his partner , a woman who cleans up his ' messes ' of mass destruction , and then falls for a strange blonde girl . The other is a mute ex-con who robs people by being obnoxious at various one-night-stand type of jobs , and in the process meeting a girl whom has a freak-out one night ( there's an amazing scene , I should add , where in one shot we see him fall completely for this girl with a soft blues song playing behind him describe this as his first love ) . At least , that's as much as I gathered from the essentials ; there's also a sub-plot with the mute kid , He Zwhiu , and his father as he starts to videotape him all the time . But Wong isn't interested in plot mechanics as two central facets : mood of a scene on technical fronts , and a sensibility that's close to poetic intent . Wong's camera moves in a way that is a little dizzying , and it feels like it should be a shamble , a fiasco of an art-house item that doesn't transition well to the US . But it becomes apparent that its form is , at least , consistent to the intent at hand . We're so aware of the style that the characters are seemingly organic from this urban , post-modern spread . They're more than a little alienated ( watch that shot where the woman is in the café , and the fight breaks out behind her without flinching an eyelash to the situation ) , and they have the tendencies of youth trapped in a situation they can only break out of ( for one it's a way of life as work that gets mixed up due to emotions with the partner , the other with his father and going past disrobing the homeless and conning a family with ice cream ) . Wong Kar Wai presents this amusingly at times , a brisk sense of humor dropped in to let the audience know ' it's OK to laugh here and there , they ARE human after all with all their idiosyncrasies ' . But at the same time there's a sorrow to the material that is given life by the hand-held , by the shots of characters in mirrors , by mixed media , by black and white shots thrown in , by editing that cuts off the head of the 180 degree rule here and there , by pumping in sad music and it does come close to diluting the emotional impact of the characters's fates . And yet , Wong has the soul of a romantic at heart , so to speak , and despite the fact that there's some pretty violence scenes in the picture ( done in that hyper-speed style that is a little slow , a little fast in a way , as one has seen in many HK crime films ) there's an intelligence that steers it from being TOO sloppy . This may be arguable , to be sure , in either direction ; some may even call it a masterpiece of post-modernism as well as those who can't stand it period . I don't necessarily think it's even Kar-Wai's best film . But it inspires so many fresh images and thoughts I can't discard it as a warped slip-up from an otherwise avant-garde darling . If anything a film like Fallen Angels lifts up his reputation as the Chinese answer to Godard ( minus , of course , the Maoism and the reading excerpts of books on camera ) .
509444	453068	69966	8.0	hip , well-acted and slam-bang action / police flick in the guise of blaxploitation	Arthur Marks somehow knew how to do it : combining the tough and thoughtful police-thriller with a seeming exploitation ( or blaxploitation ) flick into something worthwhile . It may not be for some ; matter of fact , from all I can tell looking at various reviews it's made little of an impression aside from negative . But I was drawn into this seedy , multi-racial tale of dirty criminals and ( some ) dirty cops and a dirty politician because of the simple strengths of the acting and ( most of ) the writing , not to mention an explosive climax and a nifty opening heist scene . It's even more than nifty ; Marks somehow has the cojones to make a poignant moment in this scene , as well as a couple of other times in the film ( i . e . Ruby dying in Jessie's arms ) , where the singer who's doing a number gets cut-off by the tape recording telling everyone to get down and fork over the cash and jewels . . . and she just goes on singing , and a song sung with a mournful voice . The nuts and the bolts of the plot are that in Detroit , where according to officer / athlete Jessie Williams ( Hari Rhodes ) his new partner Danny Bassett ( Alex Rocco ) is in the minority in the black-dominant area , a heist has taken place during a fund-raiser for an up-and-coming politician ( perfectly one-note Rudy Challenger ) , and there's already tension : is it an all-black gang , or all-white ? Can there be a crack when those the cops find immediately shoot back and end up shot dead ? It all leads down to a pimp and his girl , or so it's thought , and not everything is what it seems with tough / smart cop Bassett , yada yada . Describing a lot of the plot isn't necessary , as much of the interest in Detroit 9000 are in scenes of pure attitude , of this time and place in this city a microcosm of racial strife and unrest . If anything it's not even a blaxploitation movie , per say , but something of a black pride movie in a strange way . And there's at the least some equality : the gang is found to be multi-racial , including a dead ) Indian from Canada ! There are ways this movie can get cheesy or stuck in its 1973 time-frame , and of course the clothes , the slang , and the soundtrack all speak to that . But I enjoyed how Hampton's screenplay struck a line between giving many of these characters , including supporting ones like Ruby Harris and Ferby some personality past their stock characters , or how the wit creeps up as really unexpected ( the line Clayton's " assistant " gives to a prostitute is so classic QT lifted it for Jackie Brown ) . And Rhodes and Rocco , otherwise usually relegated to supporting and character-actor parts in other movies , get to show what their made of as cops on a dirty case that just gets dirtier . Lastly , without sacrificing some sophistication in the writing or a refreshingly bittersweet ending , Marks tops it all off with that big chase going six or seven ways across the railroad tracks and fields and cemeteries of really gritty parts of Detroit and put to a raucous , spot-on soundtrack . In a word ( and I can almost hear a James Lipton voice saying this as I type this ) : under-rated .
510542	453068	373469	8.0	a witty , self-conscious send-up of detective noir , a big plus being Downey Jr	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is meant to be Shane Black's comeback following a decade spent in the action-movie desert ( albeit only a creative one , he financially has nothing to cry about ) , and it's not a bad way to resurface on the Hollywood scene . For one thing , his film is clever - maybe too clever by half but clever all the same - as it sends up conventions of movies like these , as sometimes a scene will freeze and the frame will go up and reverberating out back to where it started , as Robert Downey Jr's Harry comments on how stupid this or that is in the movies this or that happens . On top of this , having dipped more than a toe into Raymond Chandler , he divides up the picture into chapters and the plot itself becomes less important as it rolls along than the dialog and the fun in playing with what to expect with the characters . Some of this was previously seen to something of a more annoying degree in Last Action Hero , only this time his wild card , paying off in spades , is the cast , chiefly Downey Jr . Downey Jr appears almost similarly in many of the parts he's played in the past years , only not quite all the time . He's predicably unpredictable , or vice versa , and you want to keep watching him with his sly , cunning , awkward , disturbing characters . As the character who " we " ( the audience ) identifies with here , Harry is quite a character . His pathetic and ignorant qualities add a nice humanism to him as the Shamus-in-training in this story , as a thief who literally stumbles on an audition and gets a screentest out to Hollywood . This is where , for a lack of a better word , contrivance springs out , as Harry meets " Gay Perry " ( also very good Val Kilmer ) , a private dick who advises movie crews , and Haroney ( Michelle Monaghan ) , who Harry knew back when they were kids . Soon a murder mystery unravels involving a woman in a trunk of a car driven out to the bottom of a lake . Was it murder , or suicide ? Who are the culprits behind all the other shady things going on ? A lot of this , as Black unfolds it all , doesn't seem to matter that much , which is just as well . Black's attitude is to keep things moving at such a post-modernist clip it threatens to spill the rest of the movie off course . But the cast , as mentioned , keeps things sort of in check , particularly with Downey and Kilmers ' ability to play off each other and Downey and Monaghan's ridiculous chemistry . What matters here are the little moments , the things that pop out from behavior and chance in the scenes ( one critic commented a kinship to Altman , which I don't totally see but can appreciate via the Long Goodbye ) , like when a character gets one in the head on a Russian Roulette lark . That pesky finger is also quite a silly aside , if only for its lack of significance where there should be plenty . Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a lot of fun for knowing what it is and rolling along like a well-oiled machine , despite the plot being as flimsy as one of the pulp fictions from the books Haromy loves so from her youth .
509867	453068	286716	8.0	One of the few comic book adaptations grounded on the theme of mood over action ; pros to serious movie-goers , cons to others	Ang Lee's filmed version of The Hulk , unfortunately , won't appeal to all those within the mainstream spectrum of movie-goers . I can guess ( hearing from a few of my friends who are true-blue comic book addicts ) fans of the comic will be pleased , however those who may not be fans or admirers and are simply looking for the kind of non-stop action and campy , tongue-in-cheek humor of Spiderman may be disappointed . Ang Lee has taken Stan Lee's vision of the ultimate perturbed anti-hero and created a work that can appeal to viewers with an darker art-house sensibility as well as viewers with a thirst for action-adventure blockbusters . In a sense this is similar to the approach Tim Burton used for Batman fourteen years ago , though his was given a shot of adrenaline and hilarity from Jack Nicholson as The Joker . The Hulk doesn't really have any overtly flamboyant characters like that to chew on the scenes they steal , so rather Lee looks at its core as a story of parents ( notably fathers ) and their children . Children who are tainted from missing and shattered childhoods from their before they can completely remember . Sam Elliot's Solider and Nick Nolte's Cast-out Father , perhaps , are the most important characters of the film after the protagonist Bruce Banner , as that they set the Jekyll and Hyde-esquire story in motion and carry / deliver much of the emotional weight that follows . Eric Bana is scientist Bruce Banner , un-wittingly following in his father's combustible career , who wants to use gamma-radiation to help out frogs in studies , and unfortunately gets caught in an accident of catastrophic proportions . There is , he finds out , something inside of him , ever since he was a child , that gets released into the open by the radiation , and the monster within becomes an unstoppable freak of nature . The gorgeous Jennifer Connelly plays his once love interest and only true friend , Betty Ross , who gets caught in a crossroads after her father , a military man who put away Banner's father away thirty years earlier , gets involved in the pursuit . It isn't just Lee's interest in getting to know who these characters ARE that makes the film fascinating , but in his stylizing of the medium - he has split screens in moments we'd never expect that give the film a comic-book edge , just how when reading one we may look at two or three of the pictures at once for it to sink in . His use of close-ups creates an intensity in seeing and getting to know these people . Rarely in a superhero movie does one look so intently at the eyes . A major drawback , I felt , were the action set pieces . They were certainly above the texture of the Spiderman scenes , yet the Hulk never looks truly real enough to commit total sympathy or other emotional connection to him . The fight scene with three dogs is one of the best fights of the summer , and a climax with Banner and his father is a near powerhouse , but the climax just before it goes on for far longer than it should . But , I suppose that notion could be considered Sour Grapes since I've never read a Hulk comic and only seen snippets of the old TV show . By the end of this character-driven roller coaster , I knew I had seen a well made comic-book adaptation , better than most I've seen in recent memory . But I wanted more , or perhaps less , than what I was given . Notle , by the way , has crazy Oscar-calibert-meets-campy work here , as does the editing by Tim Squyres .
510302	453068	179074	8.0	pimpin ' ain't easy , but it sure is fun , as the song goes	American Pimp , a film by the Hughes brothers , is probably more entertaining , almost in a manner that crosses between a typical documentary and as one of the film clips shown from the Mack as an exploitation film , than it deserves to be . But then the Hughes brothers have made a film about exploitation , the self-glorified glory of it , the stylish inner world that they've created for themselves and their ' ho's ' that is like the mob only , well , more stylish and specific . Unlike the mob , as the film tries to show ( however true to life compared with facts you be the judge ) that they aren't all violent criminals , but see it as a way of life . The Hughes's - maybe wisely and not wisely at the same time - don't try and interfere with these guys and their dialog . There's no preachy message that " pimping and prostituting is wrong . " They know audiences aren't completely numb to what the facts are in a ( for now ) criminal enterprise . But , as I said , it's also entertaining , the kind of entertainment that comes from listening to someone you know is crazy or f up and at the same time has a weird , hypnotic quality . They go through telling what it's all about - the breaking in , so to speak , of new prostitutes for the pimp , when said prostitutes might leave , the ins and outs of being a new pimp or an old pimp or someone who talks a big game and may or may not mean what he says . Actually , for the latter , the Hughes's don't seem to skimp on any of their interviewees : they all appear to be genuine to the business , appear being the big word . But it's the intent that counts , and these guys at least sound the part , as well as look it , and in a dirty way these guys are really , really funny , sometimes without trying to be even due to their own self-aggrandizing . As for the prostitutes themselves , they are shown not quite as much . While it might have been difficult for the Hughes's to get any legitimate documentary footage of them , aside from a couple of moments revealed like when a pimp named RC ( I think that's his name ) berates a girl for getting drunk , with the menace of violence in the subtext , it works fine as it is . It's like a candid string of tall tales from characters painfully believable , as those who think that the media portrays them stereotypically , and why not ? Some of these guys ARE walking stereotypes - doesn't stop them from getting their pimp-hand on . It ain't easy , but it's almost in a guilty way insatiable .
510433	453068	734600	9.0	one of the great modern re-tellings of the boy who cried wolf , Twilight Zone style of course	Amazing to say , I had never seen the original Twilight Zone episode Nightmare at 20 , 000 Feet , even as it's one of the most notorious / popular episodes ( two sides of the same Rod Serling coin ) . Needless to say I already knew what was coming - it's a major credit to the episode that the episode spurred on many imitators and homages ( I saw it first redone on the Simpsons during one of the Treehouse of Terror segments ) . In its original form , with the " gremlin " that appears on the wing about as hokey as a third-rate Halloween costume ( albeit with a decent job with the face makeup ) . But it's sort of crucial for the period for it to be a very simple creature , as it may ( or may not ) all be in Bob Wilson's consciousness ( or subconsciousness ) . Today they would've done the episode in CGI , with an overly terrifying costume and makeup job , or at the least using an animatronic character . As goofy and at first unintentionally funny it is , it works really well as a springboard for Bob's visions . The real focus isn't the gremlin , anyway , but the reactions to the claim being made , and the mounting apprehension to it , and just outright ' what ? ' attitude to him . It's not to say that a lot of this is outright scary ; Shatner isn't the only one who over the passing of time has laughable facial expressions ( the wife , played by Christine Wilson , gives a few glances that inspire laughter more than complete terror ) . But there is always an underlying tension though , and supplied by Richard Matheson the buildup and climax does work to an intense effect . The line does straddle from displaying the paranoia and mind-set of this guy and being silly , and luckily directed by Richard Donner there's always a clear enough story with a few great images ( Shatner almost flung out of the plane , shooting the gun , is an indelible image ) . Sure , it's gone tame , sure it's got Shatner pre-Star Trek going through dialog like it's all his own to chew , and sure the conclusion is a given . But it's got a deft skill all the way .
509780	453068	52556	9.0	a near masterpiece of the sadness and touching escape of love	Louis Malle had quite a running start in his mid-20's . Following the amazing noir feature Elevator at the Gallows - so hip and cool a film that Miles Davis himself did the score - Malle made The Lovers , a drama about a bored and unfulfilled housewife who has a one-night fling with a man she just met by the side of the road and decides to leave her husband and child for him . This is trivializing , of course , what is an incredibly potent and incredibly bittersweet tale that features a filmmaker so confident with his craft already that romance fills any scene that's required like a shotgun aimed directly at its target . When its at its best , The Lovers reminds us why we love watching people falling in love in the movies ( or what the characters think in a moment of passion , as does happen in French films since they are some of the best at it ) , and as a kicker Malle adds a catch , something that elevates it from something more cynical in tone . The main character Jeanne , played by Jeanne Moreau , is married to Henri , who works well enough that she lives pretty much as a bourgeois . She also has a man on the side , a polo sportsman , and sees him from time to time at sort of programmed-to-be-fun locations like an amusement park . She's obviously unhappy , and one might find this looking at it today to look a little dated , like " oh , she's unhappy , she'll go find someone , I've seen this before . " And , in fact , she does find someone else , or rather completely by accident or chance or whichever you'd be willing to pick . Her car breaks down on route to a dinner party with her husband and other friends , and a man , Bernard ( Bory ) , a relative of someone in the bourgeois circle but not one himself , picks her up and drives her there . He is invited to dinner and stay the night , and it's here where we see the two have an incredible and deep connection . I should stop now since I've given away whatever sort of " plot " there is here . The Lovers is foremost a character piece , and Malle knows this so he makes it an incredibly rich film of character . We're not seeing just the basics of people like an unfaithful wife or hard-working and bitter husband or sweet woman best-friend to Jeanne or a stuffy Polo guy or even a dashing man out of the blue . There's a lot more nuance to it than that , more that's tucked under and given clarity by the little moments that threaten to shake everything up , be it just a fly in the room or a bat flying in through the window during dinner , or a mention of a time at an amusement park . One can have an moral problem with what Jeanne does , which is leaving her husband and child for a man she just met . Logically , it's absurd and wrong and all that jazz . . . but when it's filmed and presented like this , it becomes like a hyper-realistic tale , something that should be fantasy but is too real for these characters to pass off . Part of this is how it's filmed and timed . Henri Decae does the cinematography , and with one or two exceptions ( in nit-pick fashion I spotted a boom mic in a couple of scenes that made me feel uneasy for such a highly regarded film , which of course passed ) , it's gorgeously filmed with light streaming in in that last third with Jeanne and Bernard in the garden and in the bedroom at night , given that hyper-realistic sensation that only happens in heightened romance in movies but made earthy and passionate because of the sincerity of the actors . The other part , I must mention , is Jeanne Moreau . She is one of the most captivating and desirable actresses in the past 50 years , but part of that is even as she is fairly young here ( late 20s or just turning 30 ) , something about her face looks older , more experienced in the world , weary . Maybe it's just for the character , but it's something about her that makes this and other parts she played in this star-making period so wonderful . Another actress might have made Jeanne look more unsympathetic . Moreau keeps us thinking about what her character may be thinking , disheartened by life and then rejuvenated by some possibility that terrifies her even more ( watch her in the last couple of scenes , it's staggering work in the subtlest of ways ) , or if something with her character has made her react or feel a way that is only possible because she is playing it a certain way . There's magnetism to her here , which goes a great to making the " hot " scenes with her and her partner so memorable . It's precisely un-pornographic , as if I need to point it out following the Supreme Court's ruling that it was not pornographic precisely because the Judge " saw it as such " , because of the filmmaker's connection and care for his characters even as they're doing possibly foolish and irreversible choices . It's liberating still 51 years later to see characters allowed to be this passionate and erotic on camera - whatever minor flaws , this has more love and lust going on than 2 dozen rom-coms in America as of late with usually not much regard to the way people actually react and think when thrown into romantic peril . At any rate , Happy Valentine's Day !
509738	453068	368653	9.0	about as raw as rock concert / docs get , a magnificent time capsule	Metallica in 1986 got perpetually shattered when bassist Cliff Burton died one of the more tragic and unexpected deaths in rock history . In the interim of finding a new bass player , they compiled together this very rough , raw collection of performances , back stage footage , screwing around footage , drunken bits , and just random shots of them doing stuff . It's amateurishly shot , but in the very 80s metal way that Metallica was then it's a kind of charmingly amateurish way . Sometimes the quality ranges from song to song , with some stretches being a little better than others ( the first two songs are the rougher ones , with someone in the nose bleed section with one zoom in and out camera ) . Best is seeing the group play in Germany - where there are multiple cameras used - and songs like ' Fade to Black ' and ' Seek and Destroy ' get very good treatments to tremendous live performances of each . There are also memorable turns of ' Whiplash ' ( my personal favorite from Kill Em All with a much better than average bass solo by Cliff ) , and ' Creeping Death ' , and one of their very best ' Welcome ( Sanitarium ) ' , even with just one cam and deteriorating sound / picture quality it , for lack of a better term for this review , rules . The behind the scenes footage is also worth it for any collector or just casual fan , as you see more-than-rare TV interviews , and even the group in their pre-Kill ' Em All time with Dave Mustaine ( he also performs on Whiplash in another ultra rare appearance ) . It's sometimes funny , crude , f-off-ish , but they're always realer and far less stuck up and estranged as in the recent Some Kind of Monster . This is a band at the real peak of their powers , and the musicianship is tight as can be even as Hammet or Burton brash through their solos like their on their way to the electric chair . Sometimes the off-kilter quality of the filming does get in the way - especially when someone's head gets in the way of the camera - but it's not as often as might be expected . It's un-polished but very memorable , and should be apart of any serious fan of metal ; as it is there is quite the lot that have a dis-liking to Metallica of the post-Black album ( or even Black album on ) , to which this is like the perfect shot of Kill em All through Master of Puppets live memorabilia . As much a fitting tribute as it is a pretty good video in its own right .
509856	453068	21577	9.0	Like walking into Bunuel and Dalis ' brains and going through the doors they have wide open - plenty of unforgettable moments	Luis Bunuel was a filmmaker of great imagination and scathing wit , and Salvador Dali was a magnificent , albeit demented , artist and painter . Combined they made Un Chien Andalou ( The Andalousian Dog ) , a short-film that somehow made it through the decades to reach another generation after another . This is because surrealism , the field they were working in , was one that could be endlessly creative . Surrealists could and still can captivate , startle , amuse , primarily provoke and / or even delight an audience by the story elements and images that come right out of fantasy , both on the bright and dark / bleak side of things . L'Age D'Or was a chance for Bunuel to go further , and if his goal was to enlighten the audience as well as to stir the sstorm , he succeeded . In the first five to ten minutes of L'Age D'Or , I didn't know whether I knew exactly what was going on , or was totally boggled - the first images Bunuel puts forth are of scorpions ( insects were one of his fascinations ) , and how they're shaped and how ferocious they can be . Then he cuts to some men who have guns by their side , walking through deserted rocks . THEN , after this , he cuts to a ship docking by the coastline where the guys with the guns were walking , and he never goes back to them again . Instead he focuses on one of the bourgeoisie men who is raping a woman , and who is dragged off into the imperial city . If you look at this story structure it doesn't seem to make sense - what is it that Bunuel and Dali are trying to get at here ? It was when the rest of the story unfolded - with a particular bourgeoisie woman at a party who meets the man who was dragged off of the rocks - that I understood the logic I had first discovered in Un Chien Andalou and a later work of his , Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie . Bunuel doesn't just toss a bunch of ideas together and think that it'll all make sense . In the thought process of a dream - one with light-hearted moments with romance and wonderful music , as well as terrifying moments like a cow on a bed or a man shooting his son in broad daylight - L'Age D'Or works like a kind of clockwork . Though the last ten five minutes of the film did throw me off almost completely , by then I didn't care . I knew that , overall , Bunuel accomplished his goals of making a film that hypnotizes , repulses , opens the eyes a little wider , and almost gets one cross-eyed . With his attacks on whatever was considered decent , straightforward art in cinema , both political , sociological , psychological , and personal , there are many messages to be seen in the work . However , when it's looked at as a whole , this is simply a work of art , one that has to be interpreted by the individual . Like one of Dali's paintings , one could view the work as nonsense , the work of an amateur mentally masturbating for the viewer . One could even see it as being rather entertaining when looking at the human elements that come through from the actors and the actions that take place . And one could see it as meaning so much that it will take another couple of viewings to " get " what was being said . I turned off the movie feeling breathless , like being put through a washing machine of astonishing turns and emotions . At one point my jaw dropped , and then at the next point I smiled . To sum it up , I definitely want , and need , to see it again . . . one more note - this is a very , very hard film to find , one that has been kept out of circulation on video ( it was also kept out of circulation in movie theaters for decades due to its controversies at the time of its release ) , but to seek it out is to take a chance that could equally pay off or disturb a particular viewer .
508287	453068	39286	9.0	a very keen mix of message and craftsmanship ; excellent performances	A film like Crossfire puts another film that spreads around its social consciousness - i . e . the recent film Crash - almost to shame . Not necessarily because either one puts forth its message of intolerance-is-rotten more significantly ( although I'd wager Crash throws the hammer down much more thickly in comparison with this ) , but because of how the storytelling and contrivances never get much in the way like with Crash . Maybe it's not really necessary to compare the two , as Crossfire is in its core all deep into the film-noir vein like its going out of style . It was interesting actually to see what the director Edward Dmytryk said on the DVD interview , where he mentioned that the budget for the photography was significantly lower ( on purpose ) so that more could be spent on the actors , and the schedule went through at a very brisk , quick pace . But then what comes off then as being incredible about the picture is that you would think looking at many of the lighting set-ups that it took a lot to do . Just for a small scene , like when Robert Mitchum's Keeely first goes in for questioning under the Captain Robert Young - the contrasts of shadows seamlessly in the room is exquisite . That there are many other lighting set-ups that go even further with so little marks this as something essential in the realm of just the look of the noir period . Just take a look at a shot of characters on a stairwell , the bars silhouetted against them , and see what I mean . But back to the substance part of the film - it's really a story that consists of a murder mystery , but one that we as the audience don't take long to figure on the answer . It's then more about something else then in the mind and soul of a killer that wouldn't be found in a common crime picture then , as there are really no ' criminals ' for the most part in the film . There's a very calculated risk with this then that characters could be too thin just to prop up the ( worthwhile ) message against anti-semitism . But Dmytryk's direction of his top-shelf cast , along with a really terrific script by John Paxton fleshes out the characters , least of which for what they should have to not seem too thin alongside the message . And what would a noir be then without some attitude to go along with it ? Mitchum helps that along , even in scenes like between him and Young where its very much based in the situation of the story's moment ( i . e . a detail in the plot ) , by injecting a little sly wit into some of the dialog . It may already be there in the lines , but he helps make the character with a good edge for his scenes . Then there's also Robert Ryan , who excels at Montgomery as a man who you know you don't like much at first , just through his b . s . demeanor , but you're not totally sure about either . Then once it starts to come clearer - ironically through a subjective view-point of the suspect Mitchell ( George Cooper ) at the apartment of the soon-to-be-deceased Samuels - his performance becomes a great balancing act of being full of crap and also rather frightening in his blind-way . It's a good performance when also countered with Cooper , who has actual personal issues that he faces and comes forward with regret and humility . It's really after the film ends that one thinks about a lot of this , however , and while you're watching the film it's more about getting into the dialog and the flow of the scenes , and in the sometimes stark , overpowering camera moves on the actors , so the message is in a way secondary . Not that it isn't an important one , especially for the time period ( coming right off of WW2 ) , but years later its seeing the actors , even the ones that don't get the big marquee status like Gloria Grahame as Ginny ( the femme fatale of the picture , if it could've had time for one which it doesn't ) and William Phipps as Leroy ( the " hick " ) , working off one another that sticks much strongly in the compacted screenplay . Dmytryk is also very wise in choosing to limit the musical score is powerful too , as for very long stretches we hear nothing , and mostly when it does come up it's incidental to the character's surroundings . He could've just as easily gone with added musical notes on some dramatic scenes for emphasis , most specifically the opening audience-grabber into the film . By sticking clear of that , and getting the right attitudes and nuance in camera and cast , it uplifts standards in genre material to a very fine , memorable level . My favorite scene would probably go to Finley's story about an Irish immigrant he tells to Leroy , where all such elements come into place well . It might not come in very high at the top of my favorite noirs - and I'd still throw-down Murder My Sweet as the director's masterpiece in this kind of picture - but it's assuredly higher in quality than something of the B-level too .
510653	453068	29850	9.0	not perfect , but still a vital and truly virtuoso epic	Watching some of the sequences ( err , the entire of the film devoted to the battle on the ice ) in Alexander Nevsy , a film directed by the Russian legend Sergei M . Eisenstein ( co-directed by Dmitri Vasilyev in his only significant credit ) , made me realize how much must really go into directing , at least on a scale such as this . If I were a member of an awards group at the time of this film's release I probably would award Eisenstein with the director's award of the year , posthumously . It is such a mad stroke of cinematic genius to pull off some of things that are pulled off in the film , though for someone like this director after coming off of his best work - Battleship Potemkin and October - it could have been something he scoffed at at first . But amid a film that is sometimes a little frustrating with how little grays come in to the black and white subject matter , it's still a marvel of celluloid almost 70 years later . Lord of the Rings fans , meet the films ' grandfather , so to speak . To say that something is a propaganda piece already puts a connotation to it , and often a bad one . It is something that has a full-blown message to it , and a point of view . It's still a matter of hot debate ( see the swarms of argument over Moore's films for proof ) , about whether great art can come out of something that is point-blank meant to rouse the audience in a specific manner . In this particular case , the Russians against the Germans . At the time it was nearing WW2 and Russia once again faced the ' German invaders ' , and it's interesting to note that Eisenstein was actually commissioned to make this film , as a rallying call for the Russians to never forget a crucial piece of their history . The end result comes out as being something that is actually slightly common from seeing Battleship and October , however ; if nothing else comes through those films it's that Eisenstein is most concerned about how the image and the content can come together finitely for the viewer , that style can completely envelop the viewer without fail . On those terms Alexander Nevsky is fearless . But even with the whole idea of ' Russia great , Germans bad ' , there are some small moments where things are made a little less stringent , a little less strict to these ideals . For example , when we first see the Germans in Privka , they're not some faceless blob who are totally barbaric and have a blind conquering intent ( not that they aren't out to take whatever they can ) . They have their own national pride going too , that it would be nothing less for them to go forward with whatever their Christian-led masters tell them to . At the least , the evil of the picture has a face , however kept at a low minimum for the more prevalent side to kick in . There's also a brief scene , before the ice-scape battle , where the Russian troupe has a joke that's being told and laughed about , and it adds a little extra depth where else there might be precious little . Because more often than not in Alexander Nevsky , with its battle songs loaded with a pride in warfare , there aren't any complexities to characters , most notably Nevsky himself ( played in ultra-heroic fashion , only questioning near the start , by Nikolai Cherkasov ) who perhaps has to be this way in Eistenstein's intention of having him as the one infallible force to be reckoned with in the tale . After all , to be looking for naturalism in an Eisenstein film is like trying to find non-Kosher pig's feet at a deli . But the real reason to see the picture isn't the acting , anyhow , but for the look of the film , how it moves and takes in such an expansive environment that Eisenstein lays out . On the epic scale it's just as ambitious as his 20's films , with a number of extras not just in the main battle scenes but also in the scenes in the cities , of the hundreds of people rolling on through . In fact , I'd say that any director working in Hollywood or elsewhere thinking of doing some kind of huge epic , particularly war , would do very well to take a look at this film , even with just the sound off . It's even better if thought of as a silent film , with the visual strokes accentuated fantastically at times . One could spend a whole month analyzing the battle on the ice , how it starts with the German soldiers far away and then coming forward like bugs , and then how Eisenstein inter-cuts between close-ups of the actors fighting and then to wide-shots and with sped-up editing . And , of course , one can't discount the power of the music as well , Sergei Prokofiev delivering one of the great rousing scores of any epic work . All the while the director's editing keeps our eyes moving along with this frantic action at breakneck speed . If this was just a short film , it would surely rank with the greats , much like the Odessa Stairs sequence . If I did find it a little less than totally magnificent , it would be because of the faults that do come in from a director who is much more suited to the silent medium than for sound . While I have yet to see Ivan the Terrible , my one negative criticism would be of his direction of actors , which is really as broad as can be , with the melodrama at such a high-pitch its staggering ( the sub-plot of the two soldiers vying for the Olga is the best example I can think of ) . But even this considered , Alexander Nevsky overall is too extraordinary to ignore , and ratchets up an engagement in the action and the film-making to a level that puts a benchmark for films even today to try and live up to .
510389	453068	360130	9.0	a Terence Malick production of a David Gordon Green film . . . so you know the stakes	David Gordon Green explores the story in Undertow with an intention to tell the story , but there's also an intention to explore the spaces his actors inhabit , or run to , or from , and occasionally with the lyricism of a grungy street poet . This isn't to say the film is pretentious ; it can be enjoyed by those who just want a good , harrowing chase movie . Yet it asks a little more for an audience complacent with the norm in Hollywood , used to the conflict being simplistic with respect to the characterizations . Its presentation calls attention to a director attempting to find the thematic beats through what could otherwise be a conventional ride . It's also no mistake to make the connection to films of the 70s , or specifically Terence Malick's austere visual approach ; Malick is credited as producer , so it's bound to have some informal mark of his own somewhere . It's really a tragedy of the rural family , where a single father ( Mulroney ) raising two kids ( Bell and Alan ) , the older one something of a troublemaker , constantly brought in to the cops . When the father's brother ( a perfect antagonist in Lucas ) gets out of prison and comes to visit , it's more than a friendly family call ; greed and vengeance bring him there , and a horrible incident occurs that sends the two children running away , now with their uncle in tow . He's after some valuable old gold coins - family heirlooms or sacred Mexican lot , depending on what story is to be believed - and nothing will stop him . Meanwhile , the two kids ( the younger of the two pretty sick most often ) are left to their own devices , looking for work , hiding in junkyards , or with the help of fellow underworld travelers . Aside from that , which is the basic plot , a lot of Undertow sways between tense and taut drama and action , with a couple of really visceral fights and bits of violence , and an understated character study . There's the performances that feel right in the thick of it , with Bell giving it all in a breakout role . But it's just . . . hard to explain the sensibility that gives this an edge over other dramas out there . The setting is one thing , where for the most part ( with a few exceptions ) Green doesn't succumb to total clichés with these southern hobos and backwoods folk ( or , at the least , there's a humanism caught by having what would appear to be non-actors in roles like convenience store clerks and tow-truck drivers ) . And also it's the cinematography , which is clear and cool and hand-held for some subjective impact , plus the eerie , unusual score by Philip Glass . All of these punctuations on a story that is dark and compelling are abound , but it's also this bond between the two brothers , and the memories that they share and how memories in general work into the narrative , that score Green success . It's about mood as much as plot , about sorrow and anger and fear and all these things , and it's never something to scoff as too artsy-fartsy . It's just about right .
508669	453068	25919	9.0	not the all-time best Screwball-comedy , maybe not the funniest , but it has guts and energy and two giant performances	John Barrymore appears on screen under an ostensibly ego-centric persona . It's Oscar Jaffe's Oscar Jaffe by Oscar Jaffe in the Oscar Jaffe theater , so it's suffice to say he thinks highly of his craft . . . until he meets his match with Lily Garland ( once Mildred Plotka ) , a tender actress who just wants to act and shows passion in one moment of desperation that floors him . But Barrymore takes this character , and the subsequent ups and downs ( mostly eccentric and crazy downs ) he has with Carole Lombard and makes it something special . He claws his fingers and widens his eyes and curves and does maniacal things with his eyebrows , sometimes carrying a cane or a black cloak or at " the end of his rope " with a gun . He's like Count Dracula , Norma Desmond and a villain out of a comic-book all rolled into one devilishly clever and diabolical and wonderfully nutty package . This also means that Howard Hawks's film , a very good if not great comedy on the theater biz and BIG personalities that feed off one another whether they love it or despite it , gets a boost from Barrymore's performance . Make that a BIG boost , so much so that even Carole Lombard , who isn't any kind of slow-poke as far as whipping from one over-the-top emotion or another , can't keep up with how incredible a performance it is . It fills up the screen in every frame and almost threatens to come off the screen and take a few audience members as hostages . Oscar Jaffe is called everything from a phony and fake to a weasel and horror , more or less , and it's all deserved . But one thing he isn't is disingenuous , which makes him always compelling on screen . Some of his actions on the train of the movie's title goes almost TOO far , which is part of the point and some of Hawks's brilliance here . Trying to edge it back and it wouldn't work , and go any further ( which sometimes , like the argument scene with the kicking from Lombard ) and it goes into feverish melodrama . As it stands Hawks controls his stars just enough , and gets some inspired bits from supporting players like the guy compulsively posting stickers everywhere on the train and writing bad checks , and at worst it's maybe a bit stagy . At best it's inspired and genre-defining lunacy where all you can do at the end is roll your eyes at the characters ' shenanigans and know they deserve each other . Which works for us , since we wouldn't want it any other way .
509921	453068	43048	9.0	to the joy of Bergman and combining drama and music	Ingmar Bergman's seventh film , To Joy , is actually a fairly bitter film , more often than not , in looking at the destructiveness of a marriage between two people who somehow got stuck with each other to fall in love . And yet there are some moments that are quite joyful , or at least in the terms that Bergman will allow from time to time , and they help ring this as less a total work of despair than an examination of ' average ' people who can't stand not having more . Stig ( Stig Olin ) and Marta ( Maj-Britt Nilsson ) meet as they're both musicians in an orchestra conducted by Sönderby ( Victor Sjostrom ) . She's the only woman in the orchestra , but it's not exactly that they have love at first sight in the slightest . Their connection grows following a party where Stig gets drunk and makes a depressing grandstanding fool of himself in front of friends , and somehow his downbeat manner is charming to Marta . Soon they grow closer , even fall in love perhaps , though their future marriage is complicated by Marta becoming pregnant . This scene , when she reveals it three months on to Stig , is the first real crack in the relationship . It only cracks more , with the occasional patch-up , and the question stands more or less - as Stig is looking back on the relationship following his wife and one of his child's deaths - is what could have come from all of this ? Bergman deals with his characters , at this stage in his career , in trying to just find the simple and really not very simple truths of what Stig and Marta are together and separate . For the first half it almost looks like Stig is a bit too two-dimensional , particularly for a Bergman film ( and Olin doesn't play him extremely well , even if he does deliver the beats fairly well , perhaps in line with his own character's inadequacies ) . He can't seem to enjoy anything that he does because he always wants more , to be a supreme soloist , than to have what he already has gotten . Marta , on the other hand , after having several potential men before going with Stig , tries her best to cope with having two kids that she probably wasn't totally thrilled to have in the first place . There's a great little scene where Sanderby recounts walking in on Stig and Marta after having some kind of odd tender moment ( as well as later on after having a quarrel ) , without them noticing Sanderby walk in , and the expression still underneath their faces when he formally walks in . In typical Bergman fashion we see the disintegration of a relationship ( quite a brutal argument in bed really , more of emotional violence than physical ) , even if the sort of ' patching-up ' period towards the end is a little weaker than what's come before . So on the one hand there is this aspect , the drama of two people having a constant push-and-pull tie that binds them through Stig's delusions of grandeur and self-pity and fear manifesting in other forms ( notably into the arms of another woman ) and Marta's own semi-helplessness , which is very good , if imperfect , as classic Bergman storytelling . On the other hand it's also one of the best examples of classical music being used as incidental music : there's not exact musical score like if we hear music accompanying the characters giving the emotional cues during an argument scene or when Sanderby offers advice or gets irritated at Stig , but rather the music of Sanderby's orchestra ( and Sjostrom , I might add , is pitch-perfect in the role of the weathered and brilliant second-banana conductor ) fills in the spaces at times of the emotional context . Probably the most successful , and joyful , scene is when Stig finds out Marta has the baby , by running out quick during a rehearsal , the music going along as he's on the phone , then continuing as he sits back down , and as Sanderby asks quietly of one musician who asks another to another to Stig what happened , as the music plays on . This , plus the second greatest cinematic interpretation of Beethoven's 9th symphony 4th movement in a climax ( the first being Clockwork Orange ) , make To Joy worth seeing all by itself , if only for Beethoven fans . As one of the several films included on the recently released Eclipse DVD series , To Joy will appeal to fans of Bergman's knack at telling of characters in shattered , honest romance , and to those looking for some classical music bliss and have seen The Magic Flute or Autumn Sonata too many times .
508797	453068	148668	9.0	maybe the quintessential Hicks special , albeit hard to find complete	Apparently the DVD version of Bill Hicks's comedy special Relentless - filmed from the Montreal comedy special where he finally broke out as a stand-up star - is not quite complete . It runs an hour , and is missing some footage . Luckily , there's enough that remains , and in mostly good enough condition , to suffice calling it an exceptional effort . With maybe one or two little moments where he lags , this is some of Hicks ' most flawless work , as usual ranging from cigarette / non-cigarette fatalities , supporting the war but not the troops , playing music backwards ( " You're Satan ! " ) , BJ's , and of course drugs . Every bit is stinging with some kind of savagery , witty and with the right targets but never too mean ( well , unless you're New Kids on the Block ) , and even giving a jab at Canadians as it is , of course , Montreal . But the delivery , too , comes sometimes out of left field , a little calm and subtle but with a kind of right sucker-punch that manages to really work the crowd well ; just wait till he gets to the stuff about Alabama and you'll start rolling on the floor . It's brilliant stuff .
509402	453068	40068	9.0	a whole lot of classic horror ( and mostly classic comedy ) fun	Abbott and Costello make for one of those quintessential comedy duos , simply put . It's hard to mistake a more definitive ( and probably , for some , the greatest ) example of the two sides - straight guy and full-comic guy - in the skinny realist Abbott and the chubby , warmhearted but easily frightened Costello . It's clear that the latter is always much funnier than the former , but combined they're the kind of duo that will always garner a chuckle , if not outright belly laughs at every other moment ( just the repeated use of " CHICK ! " is a riot ) . This time the two get into a plot involving the Wolfman ( Lon Cheney ) , Dracula ( Bela Lugosi ) and the Frankenstein Monster ( albeit there is no Frankenstein in the flesh so the title is a slight lie ) , and how Dracula wants to get Costello's brain and move it on over to the Monster . There's other things that happen along the way , like Costello suddenly becoming a ladies man ( and why not after all ? ) , and a costume party that brings about a hilarious gag involving a guy in a knight costume not seeing a repeat punch-out . But mostly it's a wonderful showcase for Costello's excellent double ( sometimes triple ) takes , and his spot-on timing between his partner and his horror-movie counterparts ( watch out for Lugosi's eyes , they'll suck you in ! ) It ultimately doesn't lead to much that's deep , which is just the way it should be . If it's not a huge laugh every minute it's no biggie ; the ones that stick make up for really BIG gags , sometimes as simple as a look or glance or as complex as a chase through the jungle or the old " hidden-wall " trick in Dracula's chamber . It's a lot of fun , and should be considered a must-see for old-school comedy fans .
509500	453068	280898	9.0	for the quality of the music , a full for spectacle and PZAZ !	Iron Maiden have a true sense of how to really put on a SHOW ( in caps ) , with their trademark metal brand going out to audience's the world over with the impact of a harrowing horror movie and the gusto of superb theater ( perhaps there's a reason why the lead young girl in Persepolis , in Iran of all places , loved Maiden enough to get it off the black market ) . I was there for their 2003 tour , and comparatively , even at a much smaller venue to see them at , their appearance in Rio in 2000 is no more or less spectacular . They deliver hard-driving heavy metal tunes , some faster than others , with the energetic , awesome Bruce Dickinson belting out the tunes ( pretty much , with some minor exceptions in belting out some complicated lyrics ) with the same power and vocal range that he had on the original recordings . Now , the music here and there , while usually spot on , does depend on its being effective if you really like their 2000 album , Brave New World . In truth , I didn't think it was quite a Number of the Beast or Seventh Son of a Seventh Son ; sometimes even repetitive and loaded with more thought to the words than the music , it's not one of their best , and those songs make up a good bunch that are on this tour . This being said , however ( and what a however ) , when Maiden is dynamite , they are fing dynamite squared . They deliver some of their most acclaimed and loved 80s period Dickonson songs for screaming Brazilians all rocking their heads off in the stadium , and the buzz makes up for any of the faults in the actual performance . And , of course , what would a Maiden show be without Eddie ! It's a damn hell of a good show , in more ways than one , and it should only be a disappointment to the most purist of Maiden fans ( i . e . can only appreciate the 80s stuff ) .
510785	453068	1028528	9.0	extended and uncut : a near perfect B-movie made into just an very good one	Like Apocalypse Now Redux - with the exception being that it's in this case the Weinsteins and not the director himself , despite Tarantino saying that he prefers this new cut - the re-cut of Death Proof has been puffed up with extra scenes meant to fill up gaps and give fans some scenes that have been talked about but never seen . But also like Apocalypse Now ( and this goes without saying that AP is the greater movie ) , they're ultimately unnecessary , and despite the scintillating bits and the odd moments of humor and intriguing moments of dialog , it doesn't fare well to what was already spot-on on arrival in US theaters . It's a slight tragedy that the original 90-something minute cut won't be available to most countries , nevermind the US , for quite a while . Tarantino and editor Sally Menke have expanded certain moments ( a little extra bit of dialog outside of the bar , and Stuntman Mike putting in eye-drops ) , and inserted in much longer ones , like the draggy scene outside the convenience store where we see an unsubtle touch of QT's foot obsession . It's not that even these moments are unwatchable , or even poorly written or acted , and on its own the actual lap-dance as finally revealed is entertaining ( in and of itself anyway ) . But QT and Menke also throw off the pacing of the film that was already " too-talky " by some critics accounts , at least in comparison to it's brother Grindhouse flick Planet Terror , and the only people who might not notice that it's off will be those who never saw the original cut of the film , in all it's sleazy glory . It almost defeats the whole purpose of Grindhouse making a little 90 minute serial-killer-with-a-car flick into a two-hour movie . Now , these criticisms said , Death Proof is still THE Death Proof most of the time , which is one of the best B-movie endeavors in recent memory . No matter what's been added , even the fat to chew can't be enough to ignore the fact that it's one of Tarantino's most audacious efforts in a career with them going back to back . It's got those wonderful actresses ( Zoe Bell , Rosario Dawson , Vanessa Ferlito , Jordan Ladd ) , the as-a-given cool dialog and script turns from Tarantino , and probably one of the best movie soundtracks of the decade . And the car chases are still intact without much change , and they're as exciting as they can be - relative to how they were on the big screen of course - with the heart-stopping beats like Rose McGowan's scene in the car ( " In order to get the benefit , honey . . . " ) and the long chase through the backwoods of Tennessee . And , through thick and thin of the longer cut , we still have Kurt Russell in one of his most memorable turns . Stuntman Mike is a quintessentially Tarantinian creation ( to make alliterations ) , self-aware in the writing of the character as he's an ex-stunt man who worked on shows most girls in a bar would never know , and who has a dark side that comes out in the strangest moments . He's also slick as hell , recites a line of classic poetry better than anyone , and is totally hilarious after getting shot . Now to make a cheesy critic sentence : maybe the 114-minute cut isn't Death Proof , but Kurt Russell is ( till , you know , his actual death ) !
510522	453068	109781	9.0	the nightmare and ecstasy of selling your soul to you-know-who	Jan Svankmajer probably has visions and dreams that few of us would want to have , but luckily for us he's so creative and talented and all-that-and-a-bag-of-chips with a mound of clay and ( in this case ) marionettes that he can put them all on display on film . His version of Faust is sometimes confusing , bewildering , and , as I gathered from not reading the original play or ( sadly ) not yet seeing the Murnau silent feature , not altogether makes a lot of sense . This isn't to say the central premise is lost on me , which is of a man who conjures up the force that is Mephistopheles and sells his soul . This is of course shown at one pivotal moment in the film , but if you think you know what to expect from this outcome or how it's presented you might have to rethink things . If you've seen Svankmajer's other films , however , like Alice , then some of his approach shouldn't seem too far out . . . Actually , it is always very far out , but in an approachable manner , told often in a classical style of cinema that relies often on the unspoken . In this case it's not as non-dialog laden as Alice , as there are often scenes with the marionettes going on and on with their dialogs , and then with the man and the Satan figure him / itself ( whether it's a man or an ' it ' I can't say for sure , as Svankmajer makes it a being who materializes first as some skull , then into a near reflection of the man himself as some crazy theologian ) . What draws one in is the lack of abandon for narrative , and the chances he takes in making it self-conscious . It would be one thing to present the puppets themselves , but the editing is feverish ; cuts go between the puppets , their movements , and then those of the puppeteer's hands . We never see their faces , but we always know someone is pulling the strings . This is key . But beyond simply that , it's just a pure pleasure to take in how the filmmaker mixes the elements , tricks it up on the audience ( i . e . after the marionettes inside for so long , they bust out into the streets without puppeteer's hands ) , and with the stop motion , and the moments of Bunuelian surrealism with the man going between puppet form and reality , and then out in the middle of some field . I can hardly explain more , and it would be better , after all , if he was allowed to introduce himself . Staggering , near masterpiece work .
510273	453068	296042	9.0	for some seeing this , it makes Kill Bill seem light-weight ; definitely not for the squeamish	I really , really didn't know what to make of Ichi the Killer the first time I saw it , however late it was at night on cable ( i . e . very after hours , almost up till dawn ) , and after seeing it a second time I'm still not sure . If it isn't one of the more overwhelmingly violent films ever made , it's at least that from Japan , where there's a whole film movement devoted to these ultra-violent ( likely deliberately so based on the subject matter ) tales of the dark side , like if David Lynch watched a boat-load of anime and was told to do a feature . In fact , this is what the very prolific filmmaker Takashi Miike has done here , and it took me a little while to figure that out . Obviously , through the use of different kinds of medium with the camera - there's never one set style , a lot of hand-held camera movements , digital , shaky , with editing going at a whiplash style or in longer takes - this is perhaps the point . Maybe what threw me heavily off-guard was that the film was based on an Magma anime-style comic book , which is possibly where the scenes and shots of extreme stylized over-the-top and often shocking violent acts had its footing in ( which is kind of redundant to say as there isn't one non-shocking scene here ) . But that being said , it's more what is being dealt with in the story and specifically with the characters that had a friend I was watching with say at least a few times " this is a ed up film man , damn " , and he wasn't without footing . We have here masochism deluxe in torture , sex , self-mutilation , etc , sex , rape , bizarre mind-control , and often done to a confusing pitch for those not ready for characters that sometimes seem to pop in and out or new ones out of nowhere ( Japanese audiences wont be thrown off possibly , but others may be wary of this ) . The premise has Kakihara ( Nadanobu Asano , with two faces as an actor that work perfectly ) , one of the more ruthless gangsters ever put to film , out for vengeance after a boss is killed . The one who's doing this and other killings is Ichi ( Nao Omori ) , who has a traumatic memory of being helpless during a teenage rape that messes him to the point of doing these acts against his better judgment . Mind-control , of course , is at work here , leading the gangster and the screwed-up innocent ( who happens to feel sexual masochism as Kakihara does in his own way ) to a shattering , ambiguous climax . A holier-than-thou moralist might look at this film - if one could stand through the whole thing without either being utterly sickened or just getting perplexed at the un-conventional story - and wonder how this can even exist . One might even look at how morbid the underbelly culture of Japanese entertainment might be for this . Obviously it is a morbid , surreal , and for a cult-audience picture ; this could never attract the masses who saw the Kill Bill films ( then again , just the opening title wouldn't get past the censors ! ) , and then again perhaps it shouldn't . In ways that really only became a little clearer on a second viewing , Miike is dealing with such depraved , unsympathetic characters ( even Ichi , who despite being an innocent in a way by route of his ' master ' , is like the anti-hero of Oldboy ) to not only push the boundaries of what he can do as a filmmaker with the mis en scene and music , but our own as well . And one should ask , would this film , with its rooms coated with blood and guts and moments of people getting split in half and , be as disturbing if it was just an anime adaptation of the comic book ? By doing it in this over-the top way , I actually found myself laughing at times ( perhaps inappropriately , who knows ) when these scenes were shown on screen . There almost had to be this very , very dark comic tone to some of the scenes in the film , otherwise it would just be too much to take . Sometimes the gravity does outweigh the laughable moments , and this need in Miike to push the boundaries does become much even for me , who was prepared for anything after hearing the hype ( not just too much in the content but in the style , perhaps making the surrealism of the environment into it not being interesting ) . But somehow Ichi the Killer is a film that works for its crowd and doesn't stop : depraved characters , crime without pity , and enough blood to make Tarantino's toes curl .
509057	453068	114038	9.0	the simplicity of its message comes through powerfully through the use of Miyazaki / Ghiblis ' imaginations	It must have been a small but extreme labor of love to make On Your Mark , a short film directed by the great Hayao Miyazaki with his Studio Ghibli crew working at full throttle . It gets right to the heart of the idea in seven minutes through an immediate array of strange but deliriously exciting images , and its story gains momentum by the end . The end , also , is one of the happiest I've seen in Miyazaki's work ( if a little fuzzy with an angel flying high into the sky ) . On Your Mark tells of such a winged being who becomes prey to the horrors of civilization , plague , technology , when she only got there through a tremendous blunder . But when two men finally decide they've seen enough , they go through the security , through the swarms of bio-chemical suited soldiers , and through a desperate escape they make it through the explosions and action . All through this Miyzaki and his team create small wonders frame by frame , with small details like falling rocks just as fascinating as the large-scale amazements like the ' city ' at night in neon , or the shots of the getaway vehicle running along the highway , with the helicopters chasing afterwords . How or why this has happened to the angel is never made clear , but in such an amount of time Miyazaki can only show so much . What comes through best , in the end , is the immense talents of his team , his collaborators who transform such a near fairy tale into a one-of-a-kind show . The music , too , is a curious addition , as I don't think I would've cared for it much taken apart from the animation . With it , the song works on a romantically charged , epic scale ( if it were in English , I might've mistaken it for an 80s power ballad ) . It won't remain as a true landmark achievement for Miyazaki like Princess Mononoke , but if you're already a fan of his & / or Studio Ghibli's works and you can find it ( online is the best bet ) , it's more than worth it , it's a must-see .
510989	453068	55852	9.0	not really perfect , but then life ain't either	Cleo from 5 to 7 ( actually it's 5 to 6 : 30 but how it is sounds better ) is the feminine point of view of Paris , of a discombobulated woman on the edge of a potentially tragic discovery ( whether she might die of cancer ) , and it works because Agnes Varda is in love with the cinema and in love with Paris and in love with her character and star . The passion carries over what little flaws there are - I personally couldn't really stand the actor playing the soldier , though maybe it was some of the writing that came off poorly or self-consciously - and it works as modern film art for what it accomplishes which is one of those rare pure movies for women that doesn't reek of sentimentality or kitsch . It's got some hard issues to face , but it's done in a beautiful style with the camera - itself , as some have noted its own character - and modernity in its thoughts and dialogs . The star , Connie Marchand , aside from being an unusually beautiful blonde ( I almost thought at one point Varda couldn't get Deneauve and settled on a very respectable 2nd choice ) conveys that sense of being young and pretty and possibly talented but also unhappy and disillusioned by what might happen not just with her potential illness but herself in general . There's one short scene I really loved where she's just walking down the street and the point of view goes back and forth , jarringly , between herself and those men ( and men ) of all ages taking a glance or look at her . Is it because she's a semi-famous singer or because she just happens to be a pretty blonde walking down the street ? A similar scene occurs when she goes to a café and puts on one of her songs on the jukebox and everyone goes about their business . Varda , at the least , gets us as much as she can inside her head-space , be it in small scenes like that or something truly grandiose like when she sings the sad song written by Michael Legrand and as it continues and rises it culminates into something too emotional for her to sustain . She tries to explain it as well , which makes it worse . It also helps in Cleo from 5 to 7 that the structure is broken up as it is in the chapters ; another French New-Wave film from 1962 , Vivre sa Vie , may have featured a better structural grasp on the chapter break-up , but here Varda seems to suggest that it's based upon both the limitation that time presents for someone like Cleo and for a post-modern break from traditional narrative . Why be told simply " this is the end of a scene , this is the beginning , this is the middle ? " With Varda , as with others from that age group in France making movies at the time , there were no firm rules except to be true to the artistic self , and as the camera and editing take on lives of their own and the star becomes something more as the film progresses , it to becomes a strong piece of art . Some it dated ? Maybe , it's France over 45 years ago . But its impact remains due to its dedication to its character , to women living lives uncertain and odd , and to Paris .
510641	453068	413300	9.0	nearly the best , or at least most overall satisfying , of the franchise ; has terrific ( and gleefully corny ) humor , big action , and superb characterizations	Sam Raimi knows what he's doing with the Spider-Man franchise . Some will come away from this third installment and disagree , that he's put out an over-long , angry / sad / delirious blockbuster that doesn't reach into the same levels that the first two films did . For me , if anything , Raimi has gone further in the best possible ways : he's made the kind of grand entertainment that he's been working for since the last two films . One thing to remember , of course , is that the Spider-Man movies are each rides unto themselves , with lots of emotional twists meant to get the audience sucked in by its complex human characters and the wild new villains . But this time there's a darker element to it - something that could be comparable to the Star Wars movies - where the old key Spider-Man concept ( power = responsibility ) is really put to the test . It comes in the form of a black gooey parasite-whatever that comes out of the remains of a small comet that's hit Earth . How it got there or why it does what it does isn't so much the issue as what it does to that which it connects to : it brings out what's easier to have as a person , vengeance , lust , greed , and above all a lack of conscience . It's an agent of cinematic contrivance , to be sure , but it's a crucial one for the series as Peter Parker has to come to terms with this other choice - and he's not the only one . There is a good deal going on in Spider-Man 3 , no argument about that . There's three foes of Peter / Spider-Man : Harry ( James Franco ) has gone fully into being a chip off the old block by taking on his late father's technical gear to get his own vengeance ; Flint Marko ( Thomas Hayden Church ) , escapee from prison , who is really the one responsible for Peter's Uncle's death , and succumbs to a particle-changing mechanism and becomes a Sandman ; Eddie Brock ( a surprise , Topher Grace ) , who's not so much a foe as a kind of cocky annoyance to Peter , and who doesn't really become much of a threat until the third act when aforementioned back gooey stuff comes into the picture . And there's some added girl drama with Gwen Stacy ( Howard ) , who comes in as an unintentional block in the way of Peter and Mary Jane's total happiness , albeit as not the main block . There's layers this time to the Parker / Spider-Man saga in that this is the first time we see Spider-Man as the hero of the city , or cheered on as such , and so this time Peter / Spider-Man is in the power position , which then goes on to affect his relationship with MJ . Then there's another line with Harry , who gets short-term memory loss after a fight , and what this brings out between the three of them ( Peter and MJ that is ) . Add on to this the black suit , and its own immense connotation . This is where Raimi has some of his most devilish fun as a filmmaker in years , but at the same time gets out of it on the whole some of those especially poignant and morally questioning points out of comic-books that many take for granted . Of course , it's hard not to laugh as we see the ' bad-boy ' Peter , with his hair ala Flock of Seagulls and attitude to spare . Yet it brings to question what Peter , not just Spider-Man , needs to be for those closest to him as much as with those in the city . And even more than the second film , Raimi and his cast get to some fascinating dimensions with the villains . These aren't just simple mutants or miscreants ; they've got incredible , massively damaging powers , to one degree or another ( Sandman can destroy the most and make the biggest impression , but Venom is the black suit personified as a real monster , and Harry has got only one real nemesis ) , and deep down are damaged themselves with how they've dealt with the real world and personal trauma . Even when Spider-Man 3 edges onto its most cliché and corny material ( including one shot with Spider-Man behind an American flag in his flight ) , it's a sort of earned corniness because it doesn't fail to be amusing , if only in recognizable ways ( recognizable in that we're all used to and respond emotionally to the characters ) , and leads up to somewhere satisfying on a mass-appeal scale . And one more note should be made to the visual effects , which are par for the course spectacular ( what else will one do with millions and millions and millions of dollars ? ) and expansive for the villains - the incredible detail with Sandman - as well as in general what isn't noticed during the fight and action scenes . But to me it's all the more impressive that Raimi and company uses all of these tools to his advantage by not letting them overpower the story at hand . Even during its moments of pure pop-opera and put-on magisterial effect , there's substance that's rewarding and a lot deeper that many in the audience might take for granted . By the end , nevertheless , it's a Raimi picture through and through , loaded with tongue-in-cheek bits and action-packed , high-flying theatrics , and ending on a note that makes the series feel all the more complete . . . . .
510787	453068	708463	9.0	it's cheesy , yes , but a lot of fun as the whole Jungian thing pans out	Let it be known - The Enemy Within is not great art . But it does come close to being a great Star Trek episode . Mostly because , in a way , splits down the path of William Shatner as an actor , or how much of an actor he can ever be . After a faulty teleportation back up to ship , ol Kirk is now two , with a doppelganger that beats people to a pulp and makes crude sexual advances to a worker on the ship ( probably one of the first instances of attempted rape shown on prime-time TV at the time ) , while the other ' real ' Kirk has lost his will to lead - he's unable to make decisions because his ' evil ' side is really the one that takes charge to lead . But what to do as Soolu is stuck on an icy planet ? This is all the stuff of pot-boilers , where you keep watching just to see what will make the Kirk's tick - or not - next . It's utterly classic comedy ( maybe unintentionally so , maybe meaning to be ) as ' evil ' Kirk tries to take over the ship incognito , but gets caught when he tries to get the ship away from Soolu and the others ! But then there's the existential crisis of ' good ' Kirk , as he doesn't have any real resolve as a leader , except in regards to putting himself , literally it seems , back together . In a way it's kind of trashy , and I could see why one or two Trekkies might find it sub-par . But it does give Shatner lots of freedom as an actor , unlike most of the time where he inspires the best in imitators , and I liked the dichotomy of the psychology present , even as dated as it is . How does one balance the good with the bad ? Control , it seems , at least is you're James Tiberius Kirk - which includes libido .
510396	453068	330829	9.0	better than I expected , and re-watchable	In watching Robin Williams's comedy specials from the 80's , I was struck by how much I didn't actually laugh . Considering it was his prime , a lot of the time I didn't quite ' get ' or really just take in most of the jokes he was doing , as a lot of them had him going out into the audience and just ragging on random people's items . Ironically enough he shines in this special , taking on so many topics it would make your head spin for me to list them all . But he's constantly moving here , like in his 80's specials , while still giving the audience some room to breathe here and there , without pounding over the head . He goes after plastic surgery , South American Soccer , the French , ( a bit before it started churning up ) the US and the Middle East / Iraq , and very memorably a tale of Jesus and his forgotten brother , Jerry . Even when one isn't laughing , it's still putting-a-grin kind of material he's working with . In the year last when he was really on fire ( he at least had one good film among three , Death to Smoochy , Insomnia , and One Hour Photo , the latter two in my top 10 of 2002 ) , for me he delivered his best in quite a long time , a wonderful comeback with enough sarcasm , energy , and curses to float a sinking boat .
507836	453068	82010	9.0	both entertaining as a technical marvel , as comedy , and even as horror	John Landis has one of his most memorable films , as it challenges him as a director of comedy and horror , and he's rarely done better in the latter . While many of his best films are among the comedies that he directed for SNL alumni Belushi and Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy , An American Werewolf in London stands apart from those by casting David Naughton , Jenny Aguter , and Griffin Dunne in the parts - all practically unknowns then - and giving them some of the best kinds of genre roles imaginable . The two friends played by Naughton and Dunne are out on vacation , sort of , and they stumble upon a town loaded with superstition about wolves and other things . When Dunne gets killed and something , uh , peculiar happens to Naughton , it changes both of them - principally because Naughton keeps seeing Dunne , deteriorating throughout the rest of the film , even as he both turns into the werewolf ( " Beware the moon , David , beware the moon " ) and falls for a kind nurse played by Aguter . All three roles are realized well , though it might be prudent to put a lot of good will on the male leads , as they both go under Rick Baker's still show-stopping make-up jobs . This is the kind of production that could go in a few different directions , and for someone like Landis's skills it could've gone in those directions , either one , considering his background . It could have been a send-up much like his Kentucky Fried Movie . It could have been just dumb , pure camp like one of his lesser comedies of the 90s . But here he's really sticking to his guns to make it really believably scary , but also with a sly , coarse , and crude sense of humor about it . It's almost in tune to what would come a few years later with Ghostbusters , only without the mega-wit and overall mainstream appeal . It's a cult item that probably isn't seen by many as Landis's other films , yet I still remember things very well from the film years later , indelible things like the use of songs ( obvious , sure , by ' moon ' being all over the place , but everything from Van Morrison to CCR to the main Blue Moon theme used during the crossover are really dead-perfect for what's needed ) . Aside from the obvious make-up scenes , I remember being both freaked and delighted by the undead exchanges with David , especially when it finally reaches its purest absurdity in the movie theater scene . And even the ending , unlike other Landis films , is with a tinge of tragedy and sadness . This is not the ending a typical comedy director would bring , as by now we've really gotten on the side of David , the scorned protagonist turned bloody villain by way of a curse . Some of the scenes that end up cutting back to the old rural village , as I also remember it , were not my favorite scenes as they brought more of the superstitious stuff that is not necessarily needed . It's the bits with Naughton , with Dunne , and even with the lady of the film that make it worthwhile . It's fun but not too goofy or bad B-movie-like , and it's scary without being cheap . It's basically the finest synthesis yet from the filmmaker to combine his gory theatrics with his firm , cool sense of humor . It's also one of my favorite films of 1981 .
509834	453068	372784	10.0	a spectacular re-invention of the series , 2nd ( or perhaps as good as ) Burton's 89 vision	It's always a challenge to take material from the comic to the screen , and to make it powerful enough , and entertaining enough , without getting overly preachy with the material , getting hyper kinetic with the action , or worst of all losing your audience . The last Batman film , Batman & Robin , committed the later crime , and put a stigma on the franchise for several years . But now there is Christopher Nolan , talented director behind the cult favorite Memento , and the under-rated Insomnia remake of 2002 , who has taken the origins of the Dark Knight into a different direction , or at least to a better one . His film , Batman Begins , has the power , has the entertainment , and it doesn't cheat its target audience ( the die-hard Batman fans ) or the general public . There isn't as much humor as the first film ( this film's only tiny liability ) , but there is that genuine dark sensibility that can take in kids as well as adults . That the story and characters are as important as the action sequences and fights is another bonus . The cast Nolan has put together is no less better than expected . Christian Bale is , arguably , a more compelling Bruce Wayne / Batman than Michael Keaton , or at the least he tries to put some feeling into his performance in ways that either Keaton didn't do or just in a different way . Since Nolan has license to reinvent the series , he changes around certain elements with Batman's origin ( that I will not reveal here ) , and it brings about some changes in the line-up . Michael Caine is a good butler Alfred ; Morgan Freeman is dependable as always as Batman's supplier ; Gary Oldman this time is Gordon ; and Nolan is also wise in not only Bruce's quasi-love interest ( played by Katie Holmes , not too bad ) , but also in character actors like Tom Wilkinson and Cillian Murphy as Dr . Crane . And there's also Liam Neeson , in an unlikely ( though maybe familiar - Star Wars / Kingdom of Heaven ? ) mentor for Wayne to form his alter-ego . Simply this - Batman Begins works because as a summer popcorn action blockbuster , it's definitely not too dumb or tire-bound in clichés ( not that there aren't a few , which is a given ) , and it keeps enough adrenaline and surprises with the action / set pieces . The classic , Gothic look of Burton's films is gone for the most part , but what's replaced by Nolan is often creepy and urban ( if at least a consistent color of browns ) , which gives Gotham a cool edge ; sometimes I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't . And I liked how Nolan did certain things with the structure of the story early on - which is his specialty as a true-blue professional - in a kind of non-linear way , keeping the audience off balance but not too much to know where things were headed . Basically , if you've been waiting over ten years for a Batman movie that works , this is it .
511037	453068	95497	10.0	Good work by Scorsese , very very good , almost sobering to the senses	Martin Scorsese takes the lessons learned by the likes of Rossellini , Pasolini , and in-between regarding religious pictures and makes one that appropriately makes it right . This time around , you don't necessarily have to be completely into Jesus or a Christian to see the heart and intelligence put into the material . Paul Schrader's script distills what must have been a mammoth book of ideas and stories from Kazantzakis and what's provided is obviously controversial . But its message is not layered with anything to insult the viewer's intelligence . There's real food for thought here , even for those who don't believe in myself ( if anything , it shows Scorsese , in one of his five best films , showing the notion of making a difference in his other films sticks out great here ) . A little long , but never gets boring , and even features one of the all-time champion final shots in any film . And Willem Dafoe makes for a candidate for best Jesus in any film . One of the best films of 1988 .
510819	453068	52311	10.0	the classic , deluxe film-noir by Orson Welles	Orson Welle's Touch of Evil is so good a film that I would probably place it right behind Citizen Kane ( or , at least , on par with the Trial ) . He brings to the screen a distinct sensibility to what would be just otherwise B-movie pulp entertainment . It is just that , entertaining , but it's one of the rare moments in film-noir that you can truly lose yourself in the camera-work ( that opening shot , or really shots , is a landmark ) , the moments of montage , and some of the surprise performances . It's a mesmerizing film of mystery , suspense , and a Mexican Chuck Heston . Here , Welles plays Hank Quinlan , a sleazy cop who gets tangled up with a narc ( Heston ) and his wife ( Janet Leigh ) in a small border town . Not a bit over-done with its grit and panache , with great make-up on an already heavy Welles . Russell Metty gives some of the best cinematography ever . It is , simply , one of the definitive film-noirs ( just as long as you stay away from the 96 minute version , which is akin to bad milk , and go for the original director's cut which is 112 minutes and is close to gold ) .
509583	453068	30341	10.0	A merry-go-round of a Hitchcock mystery , bordering brilliantly on a yarn	Alfred Hitchcock's 2nd to last British based film in the thirties is this classic little tale of a little old lady ( played in such sweetness by Dame May Whitty ) who disapears on a train . What makes this such an interesting story to unfold in the Hitchcok tradition is that is starts off as almost a comedy of manners . Margaret Lockwood , staying in an inn , is disturbed by an odd music playing and a clumping from her ceiling . Above her the manager finds clarinet player Michael Redgrave playing to a trio dancing around in a circle . Seeing this I laughed out loud , not remembering until the first murder that I was about to see a good old Hitchcokian story unfold . Possibly one of his best mysteries , this is a pleasure for his fans to behold .
510527	453068	83922	10.0	( review of the 5-hour cut ) A total , un-abashed work of art that you'll love or hate . I loved it , and it's likely one of the great epics I'll ever see	As Ingmar Bergman's " swan song " ( which wasn't necessarily the case once After the Rehearsal and the recent Saraband were released ) , Fanny and Alexander was a film I saw many months ago , in its truncated , 3-hour version . I knew I had witnessed something special , something life-affirming , and above all a work that contained enough poetry , passion , and humanity for two movies . But I also felt as if there was something missing here and there . So , once the complete TV version was released , as with Scenes from a Marriage , I jumped at the opportunity to view it in its entirety . Broken up here into 5 Acts , Bergman takes another semi-autobiographical approach to his storytelling , and it's a sumptuous tale of a turn of the 20th Century family ( the Ekdahls , comprising of Oscar and Emilie , the parents , Fanny and Alexander , the kids - Alexander being mostly the driving force behind the story - and also the other relatives Carl and Gustov Adolf , brothers of Oscar , Helena , Alma , Lydia , and also the housemaid Maj ) who own a theater company . What makes Fanny and Alexander work as a major achievement , if anything else for my money is that all the elements seem balanced out over the acts , with story and characters , each sharply defined . The first act unfolds with attention to the little details and the more prevalent ones in a family gathering . A key speech made by Oscar is a haunting bit of foreshadowing before they set off for the family dinner . This scene , involving more or less two dozen people , is sometimes very funny , sometimes a little unnerving , and towards the end depressing . But scenes such as these reveal how wonderful and exciting Bergman can be with his material and actors - despite it taking place in 1907 , you can see these people in modern settings just as easily . There's also the scene involving Oscar with his children before they go to sleep , in which he tells them a story , which ranks as one of the more memorable , touching scenes of the film - from here , we can understand how this brings to Alexander ( Bertil Guve , in a performance that is touching by being so straightforward with the innocence of child-hood ) to the state he's in for much of the rest of the picture . Then the second and third acts come around , and the tragedy unfolds as penetrating as I've seen in any film , much less from Bergman . It wouldn't spoil it to say that Oscar succumbs to an illness , and passes away . From here , Emilie ( Ewa Fröling , a performance meant for Liv Ullman , which she fits just as well ) tries to go on as usual , and it just doesn't feel the same . She seeks counsel from the village bishop , Edvard Vergerus ( Jan Malmsjo , previously in Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage ) , and subsequently falls in love with him , or at least thinks she does . They get married , and the children are forced into leaving ( almost ) everything behind to live at his dreary , caged residence , a far cry from where they once lived , a place lush with colors and life in the rooms . Both of these assets are provided by an Oscar winning production design team , and the foundations of how these two , including as well the theater , display how period-perfect some of this can be . The last two acts are when things get rough , which is a standard Bergman is known for . This kind of standard , if I could call it such , includes his personal connection to the Christian church , in particular with his father being a Lutheran priest . I'm not guessing on how fact based Bishop Vergerus is to Bergman's life , and I really don't want to either . One of the things I loved about the film ( than some likely hated on it's original release - I know , for example , that my father was devastated after watching this film ) is how the good and the bad , or what could be seen as good and bad , are paired off , and how the middle-ground is just as clear or un-clear . Emilie is a good person , wanting the best for her children and for herself , but she doesn't know how to do that without someone to bring guidance when she cannot after grieving for her dead husband ( who appears sometimes to Alexander , which is another matter ) . Alexander , who is a child raised with all the enthusiasm to express himself as such by his uncles and particularly his theatrical father Oscar , is good but lending himself to not being too firm on what's real and what is not . The Bishop , on the other hand , is one who , as he says at one point " has only one mask " . His is a puritanical approach , who sees imagination in only one strict aspect , and has terms of love that are by his code of living and understanding of people . Veregus , along with his family that live in fear and suffering ( Harriet Andersson's character , and with the character of the heavy , ill aunt ) , know little is anything about how the Ekdahls have lived . What ends up happening , even from the get-go of the third act , in the fourth and fifth acts Bergman reveals Bishop Veregus to be an immense antagonist , one that allows just enough sympathy in one or two spots to not throw something at the TV , but with the kind of language that only the most terrifying of movie characters possess . Bottom line , this character , whether you like the film or not , is one of Bergman's greatest creations , and is pulled off by Malmjso with icy , disturbing perfection ; it's one of the most memorable of the kind in film I can think of , right up there with Nurse Ratched , HAL 9000 , and Darth Vader . But what torment and anguish the characters , as well as much of the audience , seem to endure in the fourth / fifth acts ; there also comes revelatory moments of sheer beauty and enchantment . A couple of scenes involving Alexander in the puppet shop , for example , display a level of artistry that goes between Bunuel and Disney . And a particular , long soliloquy by Isak ( Erland Josephsson , not under-used at all ) to the children is a poem unto itself that gives me an idea that Bergman had he not gone into theater and film , would've been one of the great poets of the 20th century . As the catharsis comes , it comes with a kind of justice that works in the only way it satisfyingly could have . With the fates of the Bishop , Emilie , and Alexander and Fanny brought to a close , as with the Grandmother , the uncles and aunts , and so on , it's all very symbolic , metaphorical , and real , and it gels together . One last note - Sven Nykvist , who one his second Oscar with Bergman for this film , creates the kinds of shots that some could only have in their dreams . When he visualizes something for Bergman with the forces of light and dark , with the subtlety and nuance , it's all the better . To put this all in another way , I could go on and on about this huge , heart-rendering work , but it all comes down to this - as an emotional , intellectual , and spiritual ( surprisingly for me , who sees religion as a kind of fantasy ) sort of film-viewing experience , Fanny and Alexander is one of the most profound I've ever had . Some may feel the same ; some may want to forget they ever experienced it . But one thing the film does is stick with you , if only for a little while , and that's really what a film can and should do . . . . by the way , the 5-hour version , at least in America , is only available on a high-priced special edition DVD pack from Criterion , but for the viewer who's already a fan of the film , it makes for a great holiday gift .
510061	453068	52330	10.0	shows Tarkovsky's incredible control of direction for the most part ; surprisingly sharp Hemingway	Although I did like the 1946 adaptation of the Killers , I wasn't sure how a Russian , let alone someone who is usually much more into the visual prowess of things like Andrei Tarkovsky , would tackle Ernest Hemingway's brief , pulpy story of men on a mission and a man in hiding from those men . Turns out it's one of the best short films I've seen from a soon-to-be world renown European auteur , because of it's emphasis on the simplicity of suspense , of human action in desperate circumstances and how it's filmed with a mix of the noir style and with Tarkovsky's dependence on figures in curiously exciting compositions . He isn't alone on the film , however , as the middle scene at the apartment was directed by friend Alexander Gordon , with Tarkovsky directing the bigger chunks at the diner , and another guy Marika Beiku co-directing overall . Since the apartment scene is so short though , and accounts for just three shots , one being most elaborate as it goes in and out , tight and wide , on the morose Swede in hiding and his friend at the diner filling him in on what happened , it's mostly Tarkovsky's game here . Part of the skill , and curiosity , in how tense the long first scene at the diner is that music is completely absent , with the only tone coming from Tarkovsky himself as a whistling customer . Meanwhile , Tarkovsky uses Hemingway's dialog in a very realistic manner , even when he goes deliberate angles , like when George goes into the back with the sandwiches and we see his feet in the same tilted frame as an empty can on the floor , or with the usage of the mirror on the wall . There's also the suddenness of seeing a machine gun that strikes things up in the room , and just the general attitude of Al and Max , the hit men , as they keep calling George " bright boy " in a way that reminds me of the curious double-talk in a self-consciously bad-ass movie like Pulp Fiction ( not to mention the near casual usage of the ' N ' bomb ) . While it ends sort of on a screeching halt , the sense of ambiguity as to the fate of the Swede as well as everyone else in the diner who hid the secret is worthwhile for the material , as it's perfectly anti-climactic . It's not entirely a simple experiment , as it's too polished for that , but I couldn't see how it could be made any longer either . It's perfectly paced and acted nearly as well , and it's a fitting pre-cursor to the un-prolific but remarkable career of one of Russia's most important filmmakers .
507844	453068	74028	10.0	easily my favorite ' variety ' show of the 1970s ; so many memories , laughs , songs , and strange creatures and friends	I used to watch the Muppet Show a lot when they re-ran old episodes on Nickelodeon in the 90s , and saw a large variety of episodes , some that they released on DVD in patches a few years ago . It made me very , very happy though when I got my hands on the season 1 DVD set ( albeit with some cuts made due to song rights and whatnot , which is a little disappointing but nevertheless a collector's item ) and could get into the predictable - which is part of the fun - and great oddities and regulars on the show . Maybe I might be partly biased , as I've always loved the Muppets , particularly the movies and other little diddies they've done . But the show could be either a superb show for the whole family , or a little hit or miss depending on the audiences of today . For kids - as the original ' pitch ' on the DVD says - there are a lot of quirky , odd , and assuredly original creations aside from the common muppets ( Kermit , Fozzie , Gonzo , Ms . Piggy , Rowlf , Stanter & Waldorf , etc ) , but there's also some really , really weird moments on the show , such as dancing slinkies and a character like Crazy Harry who's only function is to make things explode with a Peter Lorre-esquire expression . For adults and older teens , such bizarre things and the assorted lot of memorable guests ranging from musicians ( Elton John , Alice Cooper , Paul Williams , etc etc ) comedians ( John Cleese , Harvey Korman , Peter Sellers ) , and many other surprise types like Vincent Price and Harry Belafonte , are appealing , but what about the really goofy gags and infinite lot of bad puns ? For me though , everything about the show is terrific in its sort of low-budgeted TV 70s way . It's very nutty , but it's alive in a way that makes shows of today pale in comparison . In the first season it establishes itself as a wild lampooning of variety shows of the period in general , with the guests almost as a given being apart of the jokes , and with running gags , a quasi central ' storyline ' going on backstage , and like on any variety show giving full-time for jokes , musical numbers sometimes with upside down chins making faces , and just very unexpected bits with the Muppet creatures and puppets that you will never see again . And the wit that goes through the entire series , from episode to episode , sometimes varies , but is always with a great wink and a nod to how silly it is , but at the same time it's also very smart-being-stupid humor too . An example of this would be when CLeese was on , and having to help Gonzo fix his long-arm problem after catching a cannonball . It's at equal turns overall cartoonish , exciting , whimsical , and it usually attempts to work best for young and old alike .
510354	453068	100873	10.0	a vibrant , strange , and completely absorbing look at the strife and creation of two brothers	Robert Altman makes one of the great films about artistic expression , the utter and complete frustration with it , the dregs of having to go through the motions in a capitalistic society where taste is so subjective that it combs over the fact that an artist needs some recognition . We never see Vincent Van Gogh , via equally frustrated ( though nowhere near as insane ) brother Theo , sell any of his work , and it doesn't help things that as things get more and more desperate , and funds dry up and mental disintegration kicks in , Vincent just starts to snap or look like he'll snap any minute . It's a powerful film not because so much of the full-on drive of the plot , as Altman is infamous for making that the secondary characteristic ( if at all ) of his films , but for the camaraderie of two brothers , of the very intense push-and-pull between the two of them . It also helps that Altman has three very crucial and , ultimately , exquisitely successful assets . First are his two main actors , Tim Roth and Paul Rhys . Both actors make up the brothers as having a similar temperament : anxiety brushed over by a quiet , isolated mind-set . But as brothers , the two of them act them as two far reaching personalities that somehow come back to the other through some form of need . That , in a way , is a subtext to much of what happens to either brother , of a need of acceptance never reached , either through financial gain or reputation , or just through some semblance of sanity or reason for being with the opposite sex . Rhys is perfect as an uptight , shy , but also very conflicted - sexually and sort of existentially - about what to do with his life , and with his poor brother . He has that look in his eyes like he's a solid individual , but seething underneath is rage and discontent , despite his best efforts . He pulls off this emotive being quite well , even if dipping a little into over-acting at times ( he might seem to yell every other scene ) . Roth , meanwhile , gives one of his crowning achievements as an actor , worthy of Pacino . When he's not going totally ape-s in throwing stuff on the ground or painting his or another's face or doing the token ear cutting scene ( it's only a lobe , by the way , sorry to disappoint ) , he seems to be perfectly still with a calm voice , but eyes darting much of the time around . Roth makes Van Gogh less a caricature and more a full-bodied being , as far as can be in an Altman film this understanding of the nature of an artist of the period . You're never sure when he might suddenly snap back , and its equally tense and compelling to see Roth in the scenes of Van Gogh painting , in a field of flowers giving up or when he's transfixed in the act of creating when drawing the prostitute when she's not paying attention . This leads to the second asset , which is Stephen Altman's production design , where nothing is left to the imagination . This , in a way , allows for an almost surreal feeling underneath the veneer of the straightforward . It looks all as if it's shot on location ; even the paintings look like they were on loan from the big galleries of the world . And the third asset is Altman himself , though more over his trust in the material . One might wonder what Altman made his own of the script or what was already there . But it seems very much a move from the director to see how the film opens , which is odd and interesting , as footage from an auction where a Van Gogh fetches tens of millions of dollars goes on , with the audio transposed as if it were on some radio somewhere that doesn't exist in the background during the first scene with the brothers where they argue about money and painting and going to Paris . Throughout Altman is always assured with the lens , allowing his actors total freedom , and in this he evens gets creative as his main subject : watch the scene with Van Gogh in the field of dandelions , as his camera starts to do the small zooms and pans with the surroundings , as opposed to just the actor ( this also goes for when Vincent and his first lady are in the gallery with the long landscape portrait that at first looks like a shot out of Antonioni ) . And Altman never goes for easy or cheesy stylizations when it comes to Vincent going off the deep end - we're given a look at it all as if it's so very simple , which makes it even more effective for his intents and purposes . A tale that acts as a slight cautionary tale for aspiring artists , while also probing a mind so delirious and brilliant that it acts as a tale that offers up many interpretations psychologically and historically , Vincent & Theo is ultimately worthwhile for its collection of superlative scenes , of passion running through even in the smaller moments between characters . And the musical score is affecting as well - think a baroque duet with one side a punk rocker .
509158	453068	56732	10.0	still one of the top comedies about utter frustration	The Exterminating Angel , what a movie - I've seen it twice now and each time it went against ( in the best possible way ) my better logic . It's a work that's the product of a kind of madman place , and it stays impressive forty plus years later due to its humor . Like Dr . Strangelove , or maybe more so akin to a Kafka work submerged in Catholic plague , the film subverts expectations . At the start of the film , Luis Bunuel makes it clear as day that his only explanation is that its nonsense . If one were wanting to dig on a pure comedy level it would work because the dialog is so strange and out of place ( if taken seriously ) but consistently so , and the timing of the sort of downward spiral that plunges into the denouement ( if there is one ) . If one were wanting to look at it for more of the technical reasons , its peerless - Bunuel has a steady , carefully controlled camera , quite tradition at times . But then at others he reveals his revealing , awesome flashes of symbolism , which may or may not fly over some viewers heads . And then , if one were to go so far , on an existential level it goes into the realm of nothingness , a kind of study of how a nonsensical existence , trapped for reasons not made clear to the viewer ( barely to the rich cast of bourgeois , a running gag almost ) , which also calls in the Kafka aspect . By the hand of a surrealist comes a deadpan satire , and it almost becomes a dark fable ( the Catholic aspect to the film ) by the end . It's a rather shocking film on the first try , which is why it probably had some controversy when it first opened . Giving it another chance , the film works better , on a more sensory level almost . This is the kind of film where you're either scratching your head and turning it off midway through , or laughing ( while in the grips of cringing perhaps ) and in a weird awe . One of Bunuel's very best Mexican films .
510576	453068	56965	10.0	" I'm 71 , I got a right to be loud lady , I'm going to die soon ! "	I was so glad I finally got to see this online ( again , via you-tube ) , because it's an incredible shot of comedy from the sharp-as-a-Jewish-tack mind of Mel Brooks . It's like Brooks stumbled into an avant-garde theater showing an underground short , like a slightly more sophisticated Brakhage short . Which makes it all the more uproarious , because these sorts of films DO take themselves way too seriously as art sometimes ( sometimes the symbolism is deep and meaningful , but other times , as Brooks's old man comments that it's meaning is junk ) . We also get the insight that it's , of course , a " dirty picture " as he sees two amorphous shapes come together and " bond " in the ways that only abstract images from avant-garde filmmakers can do . But of course the director Pintkoff is in on the joke too , and shapes his movie in order to suit Brooks's lashings , despite the ' others ' in the theater that just want silence . I think maybe a part of me just found it funny , in the first few minutes I mean , because it was Brooks doing such an over-the-top Russian caricature . But there's many , many great zingers in there , the kind that provided me the same belly laughs I had from the classics the Producers and Blazing Saddles . Though for some , since it's onlt 3 minutes long , there won't be much in the way of " story " to get in the way . It's just a cranky old man fobbing off on 60s experimental film-making - and an old man that could criticize anything any day of the week and make hilarious !
509259	453068	17925	10.0	perhaps the boldest , and maybe just the best , of all action comedies	The General provides the kind of blockbuster entertainment a lot of today's action-film fans don't know what they're missing and provides the kind of humor that's varied in physical prowess and ingenuity with timing and detail and deadpan expressionism . While Passion of Joan of Arc may make us bawl out in tears and City Lights and Sunrise marvel us with the joys of living , The General is just rollicking fun filmed to a perfection within its limitations . It might tell a slightly contrived love story ( i . e . she'll only even speak to John if he is in a uniform despite a reasonable explanation why he's declined to fight at first ) , and some of its special effects sequences are near unbelievable , but Buster Keaton and collaborator Clyde Bruckman are so in control of their elements - of crowds , of the speed and intricacies and idiosyncrasies of the train , of Keaton in the midst of Civil War terror - that it's hard to see it as anything else but a classic of its time and beyond . Just the sheer physicality is incredible ; watching Keaton put together these sequences , from the bits of him trying to load up a train with wood to getting onto another rail of tracks to dodge the other cars and just running around and then having the hundreds of soldiers running and fighting and in battle formation , is nearly overwhelming . The General is only 75 minutes but it feels epic and full of grandeur , and its got some hysterical set-pieces to boot ( watching Keaton and his female lead getting out of a bear trap is enough to belly laugh and cringe at the same time ) on top of its breakneck pacing . In a sense there isn't a whole lot of plot even as it tells a very carefully constructed story in the strictest action-movie sense of the word : a man in love with his engine and the girl of his dreams isn't allowed in the army , but nevertheless takes some kind of control over his " General " train car , and one night overhears of a plot to sabotage his Confederate buddies , which he'll stop in the most insane circumstances imaginable . The General provided me with two things consistently , and didn't let up for its entire running time : sheer cinematic prowess the likes of which is equable to the greatest and brawniest of silent pictures where you barely need a title card to keep things moving along ( and of all things a train is a really clever vehicle , no pun intended , to keep the action and the story without any real lulls save for Keaton's pratfalls ) , and Keaton himself as a one-of-a-kind clown . He's not exactly always sweet and delightful in the sense that Chaplin is , but in his very downtrodden and almost serious way he's the best kind of comedian you could ask for in this environment . It's based on a true story , which adds to the appeal of the sort of frowning clown of action - one of the truly spectacular stunt-men even in just loading a gun or bringing out his blade - that Keaton is quintessential in being . And it goes without saying that by the time we get to that bridge blowing up it simply reveals itself as a towering HOW-did-they-do-THAT set piece you couldn't try and fake on a computer . Loaded with sublime craftsmanship and daring-do ( and all on the " good-guy " side of the confederates ! ) , the General is not one to miss . And anyone thinking that a silent film doesn't have the power to keep an audience dulled by empty-headed and soulless and trashy Hollywood entertainments need to look back at this . It's a need fulfilled to the Nth degree .
507926	453068	92067	10.0	Miyazaki turns fantasy on its wonderful , conventional head once again	Castle in the Sky ( full title Laputa : Castle in the Sky ) is another in the extraordinary works in the cannon of Hayao Miyazaki , who is arguably the master of fantasy in animation , worldwide . It's plot should be able to read through easily , at least for anyone who's seen the main conventional point of either the Dark Crystal or Lord of the Rings ( probably the former is a little more accurate ) . A princess has to get to a location with a sacred object - in this case an rock-amulet - and take it to the main power source on Laputa , a secret castle that can barely be said to exist except in rumor . She goes on an adventure with another curious party , a boy , and the two of them have to contend with pirates and a nefarious man in a suit along the way . The twists are turned on a familiar premise at every step , however , because Miyazaki lets his imagination and influences spring out all over the place . We get vines and clouds and Superman-inspired robots ! What Castle in the Sky promises is what it delivers full-throttle ; it's action and excitement for a family audience ( and it's not to sound patronizing ; dudes in their 20s and gals in their 30s will love this as much as the little ones who sought out Spirited Away and Totoro so ) , and humor in bits and pieces as well ( maybe not as much as Totoro , or skewed in a surreal way like Mononoke , but it's still there in a light tone with the pirates ) . And the design overall should capture everyone's fancy ; from the Goliath ship to the little details of the robots to the expanse and crevices of Laputa , to what looks like it MUST have been special visual FX animation , it's all mind-boggling and mind-blowing at the same measure . It might not be Miyazaki's ultimate triumph , but it's still great film-making , a triumph of imagination to deliver on a tale of good vs . evil .
508399	453068	104797	10.0	superior craftsmanship , Washington's performance , and a sobering mixture of history and drama	Malcolm X is many things to many people , but one can never say he didn't make a significant mark on his time and for ' his ' people , as he and the Nation of Islam defined it . But ' his ' was contingent on his religion , his experience growing up and being an ' Afro-American ' in the United States , and as it turned out it was not set in stone . What Spike Lee's film does so compellingly is shine light on the history of the man and his place in a country with one of the most disturbing , racist histories in the world , and not make it too dogmatic or beyond reproach . On the contrary , this is one of Lee's most commercial works , made in epic form and imbued with his style at the top of his game . Only Do the Right Thing , in terms of his non-documentary features , tops this for sheer directorial virtuosity and intelligence with the subject matter . How much it sticks true to the autobiography of Malcolm X ( as told to Alex Haley ) I can't say yet , having not read the book . But for what it's worth , on its own terms , Lee crafts his story with the grandiosity appropriate to the character and the circumstances . Malcolm ( Washington ) is born to a religious man , but one who's killed by white people . He's denied his dream of being a lawyer and forced into labor . He becomes a criminal and is sentenced to 10 years for multiple counts of theft . And then in prison is changed around by Baines ( Albert Hall ) , who converts him to the Nation of Islam and its teachings . It's mind-opening because , for the first time for him , his perception comes clearer than ever regarding the black experience - and what are really their rights , which have been few since the abolishment of slavery - and he becomes the big cultural figure he's remembered as . Even if one doesn't agree with all of the philosophy and speeches from Malcolm - and it's not hard to see why Malcolm had so many enemies , even from his own fold - it absorbs one not terribly familiar with what he was about in thought and practice and deed , and it gets the audience thinking one way or another about the nature of racism and race and separation in America . And past all that , it's directed with nerve and pizazz , while not going too far off into avant-garde . For all of Lee's success here as a storyteller , it wouldn't be quite the same without the star ; oddly enough once he's off the screen - for the final ten minutes which becomes a long eulogy that drags on longer than necessary in nearing pomposity - it doesn't work as well . Every moment he's on camera , whether in the early years in Boston and Harlem as a thug or as X himself in full public figure mode on stage and behind closed doors , it's a reminder why he's the star he is . It's simply one of his very best performances , full of subtlety and wit and bigger-than-life bravura moments that usually ( though not this time get Oscars . It's a period piece , it's a history lesson , it's a biography , and a testament to the possibility for a person to change . But above all else , Malcolm X works as a movie , and it's watchable in that big-movie-event kind of way without the usual drawbacks .
507925	453068	106226	10.0	As Absorbing and magnificent as any other Scorsese film	Martin Scorsese is definatley one of the greatest directors of the past century and with this work , he proves ( along with Kundun ) that his verizons span beyond his classics like Mean Streets , Raging Bull and GoodFellas , though those works are some of the best in the American history of film . Here in the Age of Innocence , Scorsese depicts ( with the help of Edith Wharton's novel ) of a time in New York when things when things were elegant , though also brutal in the deep . Daniel Day Lewis plays a man who is torn between marrying a woman he likes ( Winona Ryder ) and making her family happy as well , or choosing a tempting woman with a free mind ( Michelle Pfieffer ) . This could sound like Arthur in the 19th century , but the director handles the material so carefully it works very well along with fine performances and excellent photography by long time collaborator Michael Ballhaus ( who also provided my favorite scene in movies in the Cobana long shot in GoodFellas ) . One of the best films of 1993 .
509221	453068	64040	10.0	aside from his later crime films , this is Melville at his best , and usual challenging self	Jean Pierre Melville , writer / director of Army of Shadows , has said in interviews that the book of which he based his movie from is considered THE book on the French resistance in the second world war . While I can only speculate as to this film being THE film of its category , as I've yet to see other films on the resistance , it sets quite a high standard for painting a very calculated , perfectly cool ( or cold on your POV ) piece of film-making on the subject . It's basically as if Melville , having lived through the period - this being perhaps an even more personal film than his other crime films - still takes on some of the true knacks of what he does in the rest of his oeuvre . Taking characters who go by codes of loyalty , professional as can be , and in a true underground in society . However this time their opponent being the Germans instead of the police the stakes are raised . Even as a couple of parts in the middle seem to shake with the deliberate pace Melville sets a couple of times , the main core of the story and the characters is remarkable , and honest in a dark , bleak way . Lino Ventura is at his best as Gerbier , a main man in the French resistance movement , who gets more involved in the proceedings following a brief prison-camp stint ( the escape from which is one of the most daring in any film ) . The film is fairly episodic , however encompassing a group of the resistance people , including Mathilde ( Simon Signet , very good as always ) , Le Masque ( Claude Mann ) , and Jean-Francois ( Jean-Pierre Cassel , at a peak as well in his own way ) . Some of their operations are simple , like retrieving weapons or finding more support through certain channels . Though here and there some payback is in due to the traitors . This becomes a higher issue as the film rolls into its final act , as alliances come into question , and the real ties of humanity together are tested in the midst of the German occupation . As usual with Melville all of this is told , in its own way , fairly simply - almost clinically - by Melville's camera . There are some zooms here and there , some very intense camera positions ( though not awkwardly ) , and exciting when need be . At the same time , there are some scenes like a short scene on a beach ( all blue ) or a few others at night or in different lighting modes that are the best Melville's done in the midst of a color scheme used perfectly to correspond with the mood ; it works just as well if not better than how he uses it for his crime films . But one of the pleasures of seeing a film like this by a real kind of maverick of European cinema is seeing how much room he gives for his actors . These are not performances that become over-sensational in the slightest . On the contrary , what adds sometimes to the tension in some of the scenes , or the outright tragedy , is how the actors just play as they do professional-wise , sometimes with what's not said meaning more ( and how the Melville gets these quiet moments is fantastic ) . Featuring a superlative musical accompaniment by Eric De Marsan , this is one of the best directed anti-war films ever made .

510342	453068	51207	10.0	if there are films that are " under-rated " , this one wold be near the top of the list	After sitting through The Wrong Man , it puzzles me greatly why this film isn't seen by more , or rated as highly as some of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpieces . True , he does seem to be subverting his style slightly for the story , which is at the core a tragedy of a man falsely accused ( and maybe not with the same tension we'd expect like in Strangers on a Train or Psycho ) . But to me it shows him really with an experimental edge that just seemed to really strike me . This is Hitchcock going for something Kafkaesque ala the Trial , and on that level the film is downright scary at times . Though Henry Fonda's Manny Balestero is told of his charge after being arrested , the whole ' procedural ' nature of the film's story , of how the system can be the damnedest thing , makes it downright gripping . Like with the Master's other films , one can see the suspense at times almost sweating through the frame , and the kind of Cold-War era paranoia that works magnificently ( like when Manny is at the insurance office , where the plot thickens ) , along with the sort of Joseph K . quality to the lead of being presumed guilty more than being presumed innocent . But there is also something very powerful , and challenging , about the casting of the lead . In a sense Hitchcock was one step ahead of Sergio Leone , who would do something similar with Once Upon a Time in the West ( though Leone was going for a lot more twisting the genre screws ) . It's a filmmaker saying , ' look , I'm giving you Henry Fonda , maybe the most , if not one of the most , good-hearted movie stars from the 40's - Grapes of Wrath , My Darling Clementine , The Lady Eve , etc - but I'm putting him in a situation where he's in this strange scenario of not playing himself , or rather being in a society that is brutal and unflinching ' . Fonda was the perfect choice considering the material , and while it is based on a true story and Fonda is terrific at his role , that Hitchcock leaves out certain details of his innocence ( says the trivia on IMDb ) adds a certain level to the subject matter . Maybe he is guilty and we just are too gullible to think it ? How long can all this doomed atmosphere continue ? On an existential level almost Hitchcock delivers a kind of very recognizable world with the terror on a different but just as engaging level as his ' popular ' films . If Fonda is our fatefully unlucky protagonist , Vera Miles is equally compelling as his wife , who can't seem to take what has been going on with her husband . If there is some sense of pitch black satire amid the " true-story " drama of the story , she is the representation of paranoia affecting a seemingly good person . Why this happens exactly to Rose Ballestero , her descent into a kind of closed-off madness , isn't made entirely clear ( again , Kafka ) , and the conclusion to the film brings something that I was hoping would happen , and did , and makes for something far more challenging than if a standard Hollywood director would've tackled the material . Using real locations in NYC , the great many character actors that make up the police and everyday people ( there is some very good casting in the insurance office scene ) , and a musical score that is decidedly vintage Herrmann , Hitchcock uses this sort of documentary realism to heighten his own subjective approach ( all the images of prison bars , the film-noir type lighting and staging , the use of space in the rooms ) . It all works to help the story , which goes against the grain of the 50's era thriller , and it works extremely well . In fact , for my money , I would rank this among my top five or so favorites in Hitchcock's whole oeuvre . It's a bold statement to be sure , but for the particular cinema fan , this brings on entertainment on a truly dramatic scale and , until a certain point I won't mention , is unrelenting .
508702	453068	55601	10.0	Hallelujah !	Viridiana may be one of the least surreal films in Luis Bunuel's career , more than likely , but it has perhaps the most acidic satire in any of his 1960s work . It's a film that , actually , might be a good portal into the director's work for those who haven't seen much or any of his work ( though one could always vouch for Discreet Charm or Un Chien Andalou first ) . It's actually got a very straightforward narrative without too many punches pulled in delving into the characters ' psyches . We're given the compassionate , caring , but also very mixed-up Viridiana , played by Silvia Pinal , beautiful and kind , but in her ultra-Catholic character is someone who cannot be tempted in the least . She is , one would suppose , the most conventional character , and we're just supposed to take for granted , in Bunuelian style , that she's just like this way . No bother - this is a masterpiece of ensemble anyway , and an ensemble practically all non-professionals ( it almost seems like Bunuel picked some of them from the same village that provided Las Hurdes ) . It's bitter and depressing in its view of humanity , but it's expertly crafted all the way , and it builds towards a tremendous climax . For a while it seems like something very peculiar is going on with Viridiana and her uncle ( Fernando Rey , in only a supporting role but one of his very best performances ) , when he invites her to stay at his home but won't let here leave due to his infatuation with her . Indeed , we see - in one of the funniest bits early on - that he even tries her shoes on , and attempts to have his way with her when drugged . But Bunuel's film , for the most part , isn't necessarily as hilarious in its satire as in his other classics . Actually , it's really more of a dramatic effort here , which is all the more fascinating to me : Bunuel can pull off making what seems , at least for of the film , to be a sincere look at how a woman makes an attempt to overcome a tragedy in her family ( Rey's character's end ) by taking in vagrants and homeless folk and cripples , while her ' cousin ' takes over the bourgeois duties . On this level , Bunuel , and his screenwriters , have a fantastic control over the mood of scenes , and then spiking with little visual details things that just strike his fancy ( i . e . in the attic with the cat and the rat , or the teats on the cow , or the crown of thorns ) . . . . BUT , then there's a day when Viridiana has to go into town , and those she took in take over the joint , so to speak , and it makes the nighttime party scene in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest look tame by comparison . This is where finally , as if in a rush of clarity , Bunuel unleashes the fury of his satire , as one sees what the kindness and support that Viridiana tried to do - if not out of the genuine goodness of her heart then as just a way to clear her religiously guilty mind-set over Rey's Uncle - completely , reprehensibly backfires . At this point one sees Bunuel at his naughtiest , most crude , and still as is a given with him , playful ( one of the greatest moments in the filmmaker's career comes when he deliberately sets up the Last Supper for the bums ) . Then , finally , one sees a very cruel and almost dehumanizing catharsis , but maybe it's not really at the same time . There is a powerful message working through much of the picture , where religion , class , attitudes are all tested in the sense of restrictions : how far is too far with temptation and free will ? For Bunuel , it can be anything , which is why the outcome of Viridiana taking in the homeless and destitute becomes her psychological downfall ( see her hair let down towards the end , and her blank , drained face at the card table ) . And yet , all through the symbolism that seems ambiguous ( girl jumping rope ) and very direct ( burning of crown of thorns ) , and with the scathing mix of sordid drama and black-as-a-bull comedy , Bunuel never loses sight of his vision , and Viridiana is a constantly watchable effort with his gracious , intuitive camera , and his sharp ear for the truth in every character's dialog . Frustrating at times , you bet , and its sensibilities on human nature , and the decisions made , make one re-think what it is to be either rich , poor , or in the middle . But it's also one of the director's best films , and a very deserved Golden Palm winner .
510807	453068	923752	10.0	a truly exciting , funny , and inspiring ' sports ' movie about the players of the toughest game in the world	If it weren't for the sincerity of it all - or maybe because of it - King of Kong could be conceived of as a mockumentary . But there's no joking with these guys , which sometimes makes it a lot of fun to watch the competition between Billy Mitchell and Steve Weebie ( right way to say the name ? ) , where sycophants and idiosyncrasies fly on the former's self-spun empire / network and on the latter just your average suburban housewife and kids going somewhat begrudgingly along the ride . It's a saga though not just about them , but about the world of gaming , of the mind-set that pervades everyone from lawyers to ' Roy Awesome ' to little old ladies competing at Qubert , and the nature of competition itself . Not since Rocky - and maybe even better in its exuberance and humility - has one seen a tale of the underdog and the king played out in odds that should seem somewhat silly . But what's so amazing is how first-time director Seth Gordon plunges the viewer into this world , and it's immediately recognizable to anyone over 18 and under , well , 55 to 100 - anyone who's ever gone to play one of the " old-school " arcade games like Donkey Kong or Pacman / Mrs . Pacman or even Pong . We see how the players have to not just go into the games haphazardly by luck ; like football , there's game-plans and strategies , and like that sport there are also some obstacles that are apart of the nature of the design of the sport . There's a whole incredible facet one takes for granted , for example , about the technology of the machines , which despite being eclipsed many times over by new systems can still be tampered with , as is the case with Steve's first machine that reaches the top score , and then discredited because of a chip possibly ( or not ) being replaced or implanted in to give leverage at a non-gamer store . Yet the more slippery side-stepping for players is what's even more intriguing . Characterization can be a tricky thing for the documentary director to deal with , but in King of Kong it becomes something of a controversy left by the wayside as Billy surpasses Steve's score with a game he played recorded on videotape - while Steve set his score by an official Twin Galaxies referee ( Walter Day , to be exact , who's a character in and of himself ) - with more than a few skips right were the score should register . Saying it skims the line of reality and mockumentary comes with the territory - after a while watching Mitchell is like watching someone who's improvising as he goes along , hiding behind his perfectionist guise as a world-class champ and purveyor of fine hot sauces with his fake-buxom wife and lackeys watching every move Steve makes . Aside from it being compelling storytelling as one sees the transformation of Steve from failed baseball pitcher and drummer to a Donkey Kong ( and Donkey Kong Junior ) champ , making all-time high scores while his kids cry about their poor behinds , it's one of the best kinds of sport-genre features in years . Many times one sees this played out , and it's been parodied in the likes of Dodgeball ( " Nobody makes me bleed my own blood " came to mind once or twice looking at Mitchell , and his smart but biased cronies are like classic supporting characters ) , and the clichés and conventions get the better of the narrative . This time there's no pressure to push it into what's expected : we genuinely care what happens in this battle of the joystick , as Steve sheds genuine tears playing his ass off at all accounts of live events whilst Billy sulks away in his living room hearing the updates on his phone . As far as triumph-of-the-human-spirit stories go , King of Kong is hilarious entertainment , sometimes for all the strangest ( Day's would-be musical career ) and silliest reasons ( what's so special about the Guiness book of records , Steve's daughter asks ) , but engrossing as documentaries should get - one of the best of the year in fact .
508438	453068	265666	10.0	One of the best comedies of the year , quirky and definitely inventive	Wes Anderson's third film The Royal Tenenbaums is the best film from him I've seen ( though I haven't seen Bottle Rocket , it's an improvement over Rushmore for me ) . He and his co-writer / actor Owen Wilson have created a fictional group of characters that are and aren't like people you would usually know , in other words , it's realistic with both comedy and tragedy . Gene Hackman plays Royal Tenenbaum dead-pan as a sneaky , mostly low-down nasty yet also with a bit on conscience side he decides after not seeing his family for a number of years to come back to them with a scheme of having stomach cancer . His family includes his not exactly ex-wife ( Angelica Houston ) who is considering marrying her accountant ( Danny Glover ) , his two sons played by Ben Stiller with accurate bitterness and the other played by Luke Wilson with accurate sorrow and inner-pain , and also his adopted daughter played by Gwyneth Paltrow who is secretly the apple of Wilson's eye . Other stars include Owen Wilson as a western writer who is into a lot of drugs and Bill Murray as Paltrow's empty husband . All of these characters come together ( more or less ) to create an engaging and really amusing dramedy , full of ( possibly too full of ) creative ideas for each character , in particular for Royal which gives Hackman a chance to give one of his best recent performances . This added with some interesting cinematography and writing ( sometimes it's like watching a book on tape ) plus the best soundtrack of the year make this a good watch any time . Soundtrack by the way includes The Ramones , The Clash , Paul Simon , The Rolling Stones , Elliot Smith and a cover of the Beatles .
508050	453068	71230	10.0	" Excuse me while I whip this out . " Dead-pan funny	Blazing Saddles is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Mel Brooks , but from cinema itself . Film stars Cleavon Little as a regular black laborer , but then a villain ( Heldey Lamarr is perfectly played by Harvey Korman ) wants to move a community out of the town Rockridge . So , he brings Cleavon in to make the people leave ( the people in town are racist including the line : " The sherrif is a nig ! " What'd he say ? " " He said the sherrif's a near ) . Funny story , funny jokes ( the farting sequence is ahead of it's time for 1974 ) and 2 breakthroughs - Madedline Kahn in a Oscar nominated performance as Von Shtupp and shines through . The other is Richard Pryor , who co-writes the script with Brooks and Andrew Bergman . Hilarious , forever .
509929	453068	131409	10.0	a kind of lesson maybe for film-students - a LOT of fun	I remember getting a kick of this short repeatedly when I saw Bug's Life in the theater repeatedly eight years back . Mostly because it sticks to the best rules of a little animated short like this . Less is more with the dialog , and editing and position of the camera are crucial . The filmmaker behind this , who hasn't done much aside from this short , is like a very wise film-student . In most film-student shorts , a good chunk of the goal in making 4 or 5 minute films is to put in as much information as possible while keeping it to the point and still having a story . The story here is a guy playing chess , Er , with himself , and getting into a competition to the death ( well , almost ) in having a check-mate . Geri's laughs and little facial gestures on either side are really genius in their own way , and the ending is one of those that puts a smile on your face . The music is also , in its own way , funny by way of being just a lowly accordion applying the backup to this wacky little scenario . Probably ranks up there with my very favorite Pixar shorts , worth another look on the Bug's Life DVD for sure .
508476	453068	55630	10.0	" You don't mind if I kill all of you ? " " What ? Kill me if you can ! " " It'll hurt . "	Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo is a not too long , not too short action film that uses its action with just the right touches of voracity and excitement , and in the backdrop is also a sense of humor to the process . If I had to recommend a Kurosawa film to someone who's never seen one before ( and might be impatient to sit through the three and a half hour Seven Samurai , or might not get the non-linear structure of Rashomon ) , I'd put this one in their hands to try out . Kurosawa regular Toshiro Mifune is terrific as Sanjuro Kuwabatake , a drifter of a samurai who stumbles upon a town with an assorted cast of characters , with a split between two gangs . One of the gangsters , Unosuke ( Nakadai ) , is the only one in town ; it seems , with a gun . At first Sanjuro plays each side , but when he gets beaten roughly by whom he was " protecting " , he realizes the fun's over , and it's time to fight back . Much has been made about how Sergio Leone took Kurosawa's story and characters ( most in particular being a rogue from out of town ) and made them into his breakthrough Fistful of Dollars - Kurosawa even sued Leone over the story rights . But to those who wonder whether Yojimbo is ' better ' than Fistful or vice versa need to remember one of two things - Kurosawa took the story from Dashiell Hammett's gangster novel Red Harvest , so neither filmmaker is making something really original ; and that since each film is made in a different continent , and with the slightest different sensibilities about its characters . For one thing in Yojimbo guns are scarcer than in Fistful , and there's a treatment Kurosawa has with his actors that sets it apart from the small town western scope of Leone's weapons and actors . So each film ( noticeably ) carries its own kind of visual style while working in a similar plot structure . In other words , it's kind of like comparing apples and oranges picked in the same farm ( if that makes at all sense ) . Overall , Yojimbo on its own is a lean , cool Japanese crime / action film , helmed by a master , and featuring a number of highlights to look forward to on multiple viewings . Some of those include : the scene inside Seibei's brothel ( with the women dancing and singing ) , Masaru Sato's wonderful musical orchestrations , Mifune's curiously low-key and rough performance ( which did and didn't serve as inspiration to Clint ) , and a climax that is up there with one of Kurosawa's finest battles .
508017	453068	465538	10.0	" I am Shiva , the God of Death "	So are spoken as some of the most desperate words - not crazy , there's a difference - in recent movie memory . Michael Clayton is about the character trying to deal with his hand of fate , which is pretty dire : he's 45 , working for 17 years for a law-firm where he's a " fixer " , cleaning up the problems that can't be solved through simple litigations . Now he has a problem with the chief attorney , the " legend " Arthur ( Tom Wilkinson ) who has just gone streaking after one of the witnesses in a parking lot . The whole case could fall apart , but is there more than meets the eye ? Murder , wire-taps , cover-ups , bombs , and at the core the placidity of a straight-laced face ( Tilda Swinton ) , are all apart of the not-too-complicated puzzle . It goes without saying that there is a little more than some debt that Gilroy owes to Network , if only in the face-value to be taken from the characters : the weathered professional , the nut who really has ecstatic truth in the Herzog sense , the cold and exacting woman , and the guy working as a top dog behind the scenes . But where Network was as dark as satires get , if there's any laughter to come out of Michael Clayton it's only in the extremely uncomfortable moments of Wilkinson walking in a daze through Times Square or disrobing maniacally on video , or a couple of chuckles at the wrap-up climax . It's a paranoid thriller where , in reality , it's not exactly paranoia in the strictest sense : if it's really happening , then it shouldn't be something to watch out for . But Gilroy continues to build on a sensibility of paranoia , of the darkness creeping up behind the corporate facade , of the sinister presence of those men in cars and vans with total access to whatever and whenever with the target . And you thought the Bourne movies - co-written by Gilory - were tense genre pieces . What makes a film like Michael Clayton end up as memorable as it is , almost essential for those wanting to go to the movies for a serious drama without pretense or extreme melodrama , is the script and the performances . It's indeed such a strong script that it surely covers over the direction - as a directorial debut it feels like the work of a professional with countless years behind the belt , with a few notes of experimentation ( the opening rambling voice-over on the looming , still shots of the empty rooms at the office at night , and the final shot as something that breaks away from what could be a bit more predictable and instead kind of haunting ) . And it's something as literate as this that allows for actors to go for what they can do best : for Wilkinson , Oscar worthy to a T , it's both subtle and over-the-top with Arthur , at one point making a masterful stroke of carrying loaves of bread ; Swinton makes the careful act of preparation and looking at a mirror like it's everything to the character ; Pollack , solid as usual , not too much to say . Then there's Clooney . Already one of those leading men in Hollywood that has enough clout to probably get Sim City made into a movie if he wanted to , when given a serious and complex enough part to dive into ( which has been frequent lately save for the Ocean movies ) he's near perfect . I love seeing him on the brink of exploding at Arthur when he first sees him going on and on in the prison cell , or when he levels with his kid about his druggie-bum brother , or just in the way he looks frightened and unsure at some horses in a field . And the aforementioned shot couldn't be done so well by anyone else - you don't want to leave the theater even as the credits roll by , because he might do something , something slight behind the usual super-handsome exterior as he leaves the audience wanting to see more . It's an excellent genre film , but it's probably one of the few near perfect performances of the actor's career ( and yes , I include Return of the Killer Tomatoes in that group ) .
509557	453068	71411	10.0	a tribute to the endurance of man and nature , featuring a masterpiece of a performance	For a variety of reasons ( that are well known in the darker period of the director's history at this time ) , Akira Kurosawa left Japan to make a film in Russia ( Siberia to be exact ) . Instead of an epic action picture , he went to one of his other passions as a storyteller - the drama of pure humanity ( like Ikiru and Red Beard , this film follows in that vein ) . The film runs two hours and twenty minutes , but it is a kind of epic story , that does have that pulse of adventure from his other films . But this time he combines that method of a big , spacious environment in the wild with a deep character study . His craftsmanship as a ' painter ' of the frame is top-notch as always ( all pretensions aside , he is one of the masters at finding the textures and moods in a scene's look as in its character and action ) , and the use of locations brings a quality that directors today would brush aside with via special and visual effects . Simply put , it is one of , if not the , ultimate testaments to man vs / with nature , with a character that remains one of the most memorable that Kurosawa's envisioned . To give an idea of who Dersu Uzala is to someone who hasn't seen the film , picture Yoda without the ability to lift objects with his mind and to kick ass with a light-saber , but still contains all of the direct wisdom and strength that make him one with his surroundings ( and , as well , uses his own kind of ' force ' for knowledge and defense , and for attack as an ultimately final resort ) . As a lonesome hunter and drifter with a family tragically lost , Dersu comes upon a team of explorers led by Captain Aseniev ( Yuri Solomon , not the best performance but sturdy enough to sustain the physical scenes ) . He goes along with them as a guide of the sights and smells and feelings that the others just can't sense ( out of lack of experience ) . Aseniev and Dersu end up becoming friends as they brace a torrid windstorm over a bare , wintry landscape , as Kurosawa brings out one of his towering sequences ( topping anything David Lean could've drummed up for sure ) . It's always of interest to me to see characters doing things on screen , having to go against the elements that almost dwarf them in the face of nature ( i . e . Cast Away's hour and a half second act ) . Dersu Uzala seems to be of few words and mostly actions , and soon gains respect and admiration after an odd introduction to the team - he shoots with a keener than keen eye , he spots tracks , he sets up protection in the harshest of conditions , and is always a step ahead of the pack . And bringing all this out is actor Maksim Munzuk , who appears here ( like Falconetti in Passion of Joan of Arc ) in the performance of a lifetime out of an otherwise obscure and small career . Munzuk never brings anything to Dersu that isn't in his character , and he makes at least a quarter of the film's success a reality ( the other three-quarters could be attributed to Kurosawa alone ) . He can be tough , smart , funny ( in an off-beat way ) , and if nothing else , humble . But more than anything , Munzuk makes Dersu seem alive in a way no other actor could've accomplished , and also brings out the better in Solomon's performance . The story itself has a superb appeal most of the way , but it is in it's last act that ' Derzu Uzala ' reaches an intensely tragic plane . Dersu does something ( which I won't reveal here and has been discussed elsewhere on the message board ) that brings great shame to his own self-worth . In this part of the film , Kurosawa brings out what can be said to be some of the saddest moments in any of his work , however not without logic . While it was likely a major dramatic function in the novel , Kurosawa doesn't just throw these last twenty minutes or so to let steam flow out of the picture . I sensed something almost cathartic about these scenes , that rose the qualities of the rest of the story to a higher level , to one of almost spiritual in nature . It's hard to really pin-point to one who has not seen the film ( and , indeed , I have seen the film all of one time ) . But once its over , you may feel you have seen a work far more rewarding than imaginable - even in awe .
508482	453068	71315	10.0	As coolly intense and exceptionally-staged as any detective story / film-noir of the 40's & 50's	Chinatown is a tremendous collaborative effort that produced one of the most memorable Hollywood pictures of the 1970's . Director Roman Polanski ( his last film in America , and the first he made in America after the murder of Sharon Tate ) , stars Jack Nicholson & Faye Dunaway , and writer Robert Towne , all come together to create a detective story classic . At times it slows its pace down so the viewer can think along with Nicholson's character , to take in the environment as well as the situation he's in ( i . e . when he goes to the empty reservoir , when he visits Noah Crosses house the first time ) . And the script has the perfect sense of drawing us into a story , fueled by curiosity , grit , and cynicism , and engages the viewer by its realistic dialog between the characters . J . J . Gittes ( Nicholson , in one of his best 70's performances ) is in Los Angeles circa 1933 in the line of private investigator , usually dealing with people who may or may not believe that their significant other is having an affair . Evelyn Mulwray feels this may be the case with her husband Hollis , and Gittes decides to take the case . However , this draws him into a deeper case involving the city's loss of water once Hollis - a major player in the water supply controversy in the city - is found murdered . This eventually leads him to Noah Cross ( John Huston ) , a big businessman and who also happens to be Evelyn's father . Intrigue starts to develop , as Jake's own life begins to be at risk . As a intricate , detailed detective story the film is an above-average work , with Towne's script containing the maturity , and wicked sense of humor , of a James M . Cain or Raymond Chandler novel . When the thrills come they come as being striking . And when humanity and compassion get thrown into the mix , the film reaches a whole other plane of intelligence . The last third of the film could turn off some of the audience ( depending on one's own level of belief ) , but it holds strong thanks to the performances . Nicholson doesn't over-step his bounds in any scene , finding the right notes in suggestive conversations . Dunaway is better than expected ( though I'm not sure if it's an great performance ) . And Huston's Noah Cross is one of the more disturbing villains of that period in movies . Add to it some good cameos ( Burt Young as a driver , Polanski playing the little guy in the infamous ' knife ' scene ) , and a smooth soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith , Chinatown comes out as strong piece of movie-making , and arguably one of the greatest in the crime / mystery genre .
509203	453068	75314	10.0	A Disturbing and Powerful Masterpiece	Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is a riveting , disturbing and powerful masterpiece of a film that gives new meaning to the word " snapped " .

De Niro plays Travis Bickle , a disturbed taxi driver who drives his taxi all around new York City going crazier every day . He also meets Iris ( AKA Easy ) played by Foster who is also disturbed , but in a not as good way . And what the story leads up to is one of the most memorable pieces of cinema ever . The film is great , the score by Bernard Hermann ( his last ) is excellent , and the feeling , and atmosphere is perfect . So , " are you talking to me " ?
508770	453068	75276	10.0	the story of man's incredible / mundane downfall , in one of Herzog's best	What an unclassifiable hybrid / whatever movie Stroszek is . I'd wager it's the kind of picture that Gonzo the Great ( yes , the Muppet ) would probably make if he were from Germany and looking to make a tragic-comic look on one man's journey in the rural side of America ( after all , the last sequence would make perfect sense , wouldn't it ) . In truth , it's Werner Herzog at his most focused and un-hinged , a work of wild , original art where the tone ranges from harsh reality , documentary realism ( or so we might think ) , to drama stripped of its ' melo ' , and a brand of satire that goes beyond the usual realm and is satirical only in the sense that you know something is being made fun of . In fact , I'd say the last twenty-five , thirty minutes of this picture are the funniest , and even in these minutes there's a sense of sorrow to what has happened with Bruno Stroszek ( Bruno S . , sort of as himself , I suppose , the line between fiction and fact is so blurry that it's the only way Herzog can get things done ) and how his girlfriend ( Eva Mattes ) leaves him , and his best friend and neighbor gets arrested after armed robbery of a , uh , store in a basement next to a bank , I guess . But whatever weirdness and sort of everyday mundane qualities that go hand in hand with the film Stroszek are given a greater context . I actually had a little more interest in what was going on after having just seen Chaplin's Modern Times , and seeing how there could be a comparison made to the two . Of course , Herzog could never be one to induce the silly physical comedy that makes up the bulk of Chaplin's films , but there is a similarity that struck me , and helped make me really care about what was going on with these characters - Herzog , for all his showing the ultimate follies , loves Stroszek , or at least does not try and show him off as being a complete waste of life . And if it does almost come off that way ( Stroszek is , after all , a perpetual drunk who got released only recently from the mental hospital , and can never get steady work aside from being a mechanic once in the US ) , it's off-set by how much he even cares about the much more flawed Eva , too . He sees them in a context of society and civilization as well as just stand-alone outcasts ( outcasts being another Chaplin comparison ) not to mention the other side characters , both wretchedly cruel and mean like the Germans who bully Stroszek and beat up on Eva , or the wacky co-workers and very formal mortgage / loan people . So , in a way , Herzog takes on the other side of what we might usually find in a Chaplin effort , which includes cynicism ( at least skepticism ) , despair , and replacing morality with a truly twisted sense of humor . Not that the form of documentary , more than anything , peeks its head into the work . There isn't much story to report , aside from the bulk of what I've already mentioned - Stroszek , Eva and their elderly neighbor escape from the harsh and cruel state of being they're at in Berlin ( a brief but interesting commentary on Germany too ) , only to find in the small-town Wisconsin life not much more in line of prosperity . Soon , Stroszek is on his own when he loses his trailer-home , Eva leaves him after a drunken ramble he goes on , and of course the aforementioned botched robbery . He heads off randomly to another small town , tells his story to a random guy , and then as his truck goes up in flames , he gets caught on a ski-lift after passing by a dancing chicken . All the while Bruno S . plays this guy with no punches pulled , and is as intuitive a non-professional actor as any given others in the old neo-realist days . Eva , too , wasn't that much of an actress yet when she took on this role . And a lot of the time ( David Lynch mentioned this in an interview as he started watching the film in the middle ) it's like watching a documentary of these people , showing in all the ordinary working-class ways how they get stuck and any chance of the " American dream " gets squashed . One's never really sure who's an actor or not , but it makes no difference really . A lot of it is some of the most harrowing cinema that I've seen in a while - the tone is of a bitterness at the system , any system , and of a sorrow that is everlooming , that is , perhaps , until the ending . Remarkable then is really how much I laughed during the film . Even in the earlier scenes , when it was dreary , the sort of behavior in parts , and especially notes of the dialog , rang of the complete randomness that is all abound in Herzog's work . But one only needs to look at Stroszek to see the Herzog sense of humor working full-tilt amid the social commentary and despair . The two funniest sequences - not withstanding the armed robbery - are the auction scene ( that guy , wow , just wow is all I could say after that ) , and the dancing chicken . A big chunk of the dancing chicken scene's bizarre appeal is the music , with a true absurdity to the harmonica playing and wailing vocals . Many over the years have wondered the significance of the dancing chicken , most particularly as the ending to the picture . While Herzog himself claims it to be a metaphor for something he can't place , a friend mentioned that it could be capitalism , or the chicken as a representation of Bruno Stroszek , or of an American in general . I wouldn't want to jump to any conclusions just yet , and I'm glad that way - all I know is that it's one of the funniest three minutes of film to ever come out of Europe . It's Herzog's ultimate , tragic-comic tale about a man in the lower depths of himself and his society .
510179	453068	195658	10.0	four of the greatest rock epics ever , all in one concert !	To see a complete concert from the Doors is like taking a wild trip into a different frame of mind in rock and roll , when you could see just about anything on stage creatively . This concert , from 1968 in Hollywood , is the band in their utmost prime . With the Doors you get the strange , overpowering presence and lead-man power of Jim Morrison , who gets in such a frame of mind during his sets one wonders if he puts himself in a trance ( or maybe not - before ' The End ' plays , he tries to tell the lighting people to fix something , and it becomes a little comical ) . Bottom line is that the concert features the best of the Doors live , and for especially the more blues-driven rock fans , there are some great numbers of ' Alabama Song ' , ' Back Door Man ' , and ' Five to One ' . But mostly , and this was the pleasure for me , the highlights include the longer songs - the slow , pulsating ' When the Music's Over ' , the classic hit ' Light my Fire ' ( as many times as I've heard it on the radio , it never gets old live ) , ' The End ' being one of the Doors most notorious and beautiful epics , and their most stream-of-consciousness work ' Celebration of the Lizard ' which has the distinction of having Morrison's poetry overcoming the rock parts of the song . Basically , it's one of the purest rock concert videos out there , and it may even turn on some casual observers of the Doors to check out more of the non-radio stuff like ' Lizard ' and ' Spanish Caravan ' .
509633	453068	101761	10.0	" Nothing to touch the earth , not to see the sun , nothing left to do but run , run , run , let's run . "	This is just a sampling of the lyrics that singer / writer Jim Morrison contributed to his group The Doors , and just this , as part of his epic piece " The Celebration of the Lizard " shows his skill as a master of the written word . He is shown in Oliver Stone's The Doors as a shy , though often obnoxious and crude , persona who self describes himself in one scene : " I think of myself as a sensitive , intelligent human being , but with the soul of a clown that forces me to blow it at the most crucial of moments . " He may have blown it in the end , but it makes for a fascinating story . As being a Doors fan , the music and words are the best character of the movie - the songs represent feelings and emotions , desires and hatreds , and other facets of life in the late 60's , are indispensable gems of rock and blues . While the Doors recorded only six albums together ( not counting American Prayer , Morrison's awesome feat of an album ) each one is still transfixed into the minds of people all over the world . It's thirty-two years since the king died , but in another thirty-two he will still be remembered . And that is a fact that Stone plays with like Travis Bickle in front of the mirror with his guns in Taxi Driver . He reveals only Morrison's known persona , and not the quiet moments . The concert recreations are grand , but there isn't more of the sweet Jim ( one glimpse of such a Jim is seen at a birthday party when he gives out gifts as " Chief Mojo Risin ) What is shown is splendid enough for his abilities - he paints a vivid picture of Los Angeles 1965 onward , with Val Kilmer in the second best acting job of 1991 ( deserved of an Oscar nomination ) , and puts Jim in the middle . He is a man who is fascinated with death , with man's wills to power , and how life gets painful without the chemicals top open the mind . Kilmer gets so much into your head in this film that by the end you'll love him , hate him , or feel wonder about him . I felt wonder about him , wonder why he looked to heroes who gave him such ideas about the love of death , wonder why he felt the need to take it to the limits . But his desires are Stone's as well , and while this isn't a perfect film , it's one that isn't easily forgotten .
509998	453068	59807	10.0	it can now be found on some sites on-line ; well worth seeking out as one of the best of the 60s	Jim Henson as a filmmaker sometimes doesn't get as much credit as for his main innovations with the Muppets and establishing them throughout the years as the head producer of the Henson company . But behind the genius puppeteer that he was , he was also very good at creating a style that was all his own , whether it was with the original and enlightening fantasy films he made in the 80s or with the Muppet movies . Part of what crosses over from his time with the Muppets with this rarely seen short film , Time Piece , is the pure sense of tongue placed firmly in cheek . The theme of time is one that many art films deal with ( not the least of which Bergman ) , but this film is like a collaboration between the crazier silent shorts of the 1920s and Chuck Jones . I laughed many times during this film , but it's also a marvel of - of course - timing , but also at getting the right rhythm with the images . It goes without saying that its directness in the editing , with its tempo always on step without going overboard , is some of the best I've ever seen in a short film . Little moments end up making the best parts of Henson's film , where no real story emerges aside of himself sort of being witness to the follies of the world in a very crazy manner . And it's also an exercise in repetition - a few times the one spoken word of the film pops up ( " Help " ) - by Henson , and it's always very funny . But the comic timing is explored in little themes Henson had in later films , such as food , with one of the real laugh out loud bits being when Henson and the woman eat at the table as they one-up each other . Or seeing the delirious pathway in Henson running around towards the end ( being chased , no doubt , by archive footage ) . It all ends then , to put it mildly , down the toilet ( literally I mean ) . This is a surprising film with as much invention that can be fused cinematically into its concept - showing time as being very musical in a sense , and possibly breaking the balance that it usually keeps with day to day life . It's an early gem , and its quite a stroke of luck to find it on-line or through a rare 16mm print ; one of the true unfortunates in being unavailable to the masses and other fans of Henson .
508576	453068	28950	10.0	Thoroughly enjoyable , memorable characters and scenes , an early classic in humanist / prison escape films	I can't deny that Jean Renoir has a genuine eye for human connectedness and moves his camera with a practical naturalness . The performances by the principal actors as well ( Jean Gabin as the working-class Marechal , Pierre Fresnay as the eloquent Boieldieu , Marcel Dalio as the subtle and happy Rosenthal , and Erich von Stroheim as the un-mistakenly stiffest and suavest of movie prison wardens Captain von Rauffenstein ) are on the money every step of the way . Perhaps my one problem ( and it's not a big one ) with The Grand Illusion is that despite it being made at a time when cinema , in particular sound cinema , was just starting out , there could've been better targets hit by Renoir . He hits on a mark with these prisoners as well as with the guards - these are regular people , caught up and made to feel like they're in the schoolyard with ruthless heads and rebellious minions . As a satire , for some reason , it works a lot better for me than a drama - at least at first . For example , when Marechal is in solitary in the first prison , this is a masterpiece of a scene in and of itself , and for some reason I wanted more moments like this . While this could be attributable to the fact that Renoir didn't film everything he had intended with his script ( lack of budget one can assume ) , there are some expectations that weren't up to what could've been met . This may be variable from viewer to viewer , which is why this shouldn't deter those interested in seeing this - this is one of those POW films that's inspired others ( i . e . Great Escape ) , but has a sort of spirit that's all it's own . On the other hand in what comes out when one takes more of a look - which Renoir allows through how watchable ( in terms of just being able to not turn off the film once it starts ) the drama does become integrated with the critical view of the characters and changing situation . It's almost TOO complex , if that's possible . One of the fantastic joys of Grand Illusion is how much there is life and energy in his scenes depicting the prisons of world war one . Like in a Fellini drama ( which it may very well have inspired for the later Italian ) , there's a lot pf love for how cinema is made itself to get too depressed with the story & characters . And like in a neo-realist film , the dialog between the people is quite realistic and interesting . Some of the supporting characters / actions may seem odd to some new viewers , although one has to take into context the period . With an awesome cameraman ( Christian Matras ) , finite music score by Joseph Kosma , and an escape scene that's almost as thrilling as what Darabont cooked up in Shawshank , Grand Illusion is deservedly so the first film released by the Criterion collection ( DVDs ) , and is a suave , nice note in film history . AND , it definitely becomes better upon repeat viewings , as these characters become more familiar , as if we're in there in the prisons with these amicable , existential beings .
508657	453068	86190	10.0	Not the best , but still fun	Return of the Jedi is the last of the series ( episode 6 ) and it may not be the best of the series , but like the other films , it still is all in good fun ( and the Flash Gordon matinae serials ) . The story brings Luke Skywalker to confront his father for the second time with Emperor Palpatine helping along . Also , a group of freedom fighters ( led by Han Solo ) , try to shut down a power base on the moon Endor that is controling the second Death Star . By the way , don't forget the first half hour of the movie which shows the gang freeing Han from Jabba the Hutt . This story is just the beginning of a fun , entertaining and important film that goes just right with the other six ( or three ) sagas .
509280	453068	66921	10.0	Definitely the best film ever made , or at least the most shockingly effective	Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange is a great film , but also stubbornly so , to the point where you have to either like it or dis-like it ( as Pauline Kael said , it's from the mind of a ' mad German filmmaker mind ' , ho-ho ) . It looks into the human ways like never before ( rarely since as funny or questioningly ) in the style that only Kubrick could do . Even though it was banned from the UK and Australia , the controversy isn't compromised . The writing , direction and acting is at it's highest peak form and just when you think it couldn't get better , it gets to be the best . Also , the breakthrough performance of Malcolm McDowell gets him at the top of the British actors list in my book ( this performance most likely got him noticed in the film world ) . And all the elements surrounding him makes it perfect . Finally , the themes are terrific . The way the film shows how the government screws a regular fiend over is great . The film is provoking , if nothing else , which is what most of the great films should do , and it's my personal favorite from Kubrick .
510526	453068	346491	10.0	like Alexander himself , the latest epic from Oliver Stone , it has it's moments of greatness , though surely not overall	The final product of Oliver Stone's decades-in-the-making epic on Alexander the great had me stunned walking out of the theater . Not because I thought it was particular great or masterful , and not because I thought it was a failure either . What stunned me was how there could be a few points in the film where I thought that Stone , like Alexander in a sense , reached heights he's barely gone to before , but then in other spots he boggled my mind with how he lost me . For example , take the second battle sequence , in which Alexander leads his weary army towards an Indian army , where Elephants stampede furiously against the troops on horses , and Alexander gets a bit of a shock ( one which I won't reveal ) . After this shock , the rest of the battle scene is tinted , with a red glaze and form that gives the scene a complete , abrasive illusionment . I can consider this to include what is best and worst in Stone's talents as a storyteller - he creates this huge , massive sequence , using multiple angles and special effects . There is also an over-load of the kind of symbolism and melodramatic tendencies that have only popped up occasionally in past Stone films . The main focus being the significance of the bird in the sky ( or King Phillip ) to be used like the shaman in the Doors , only far too prominent to be easily desired . It's the kind of battle sequence I'd like to analyze shot-by-shot sometime , not necessarily because I'd like it more , but because it's the kind of sequence that you almost never see in major motion pictures . Like Natural Born Killers ( which is one of the ultimate love or hate films ever made ) , Stone brings his unique , art-house sensibilities to a Hollywood budget and goes wild . The story he tells jumps around in revealing the rise and fall of the Macedonian . More than showing how ferocious and intelligent he was at battle ( though that and other scenes of violence take up more than a third of the whole picture ) , Stone opts to get into his psychology via parents Phillip and Olympia ( the sexy , sometimes frightening Angelina Jolie ) . This is where Stone makes some interesting ground , yet also , more often than not , doesn't know how to stick to something . A lot of the scenes involving Alexander's anger and frustration with his parents probably looked better on paper than they do on screen . And it's not necessarily the actors ' faults entirely - the repetitive usage of close-ups , and the sometimes horrendous musical score by Vangelis , adds to it being less engaging . The acting , much like the direction , tips the scale to both sides by either fitting into their characters wonderfully , or not finding what is there at all and over-playing . Kilmer was impressive at playing a cretin of a father . Jolie was so-so . Leto's was one of the least impressive performances I've seen this year ( I just could not see what affect Hephaistilon could have had on Alexander ) . Dawson and Hopkins were good , though somewhat under-used . Then there is Farrell , who for many who see this film may be what makes or breaks it for them . In most scenes , he finds the right notes and tones for his expression , the way he looks in close-ups . He does prove he can be a leading man in Hollywood . But what disappointed me was in how in some scenes he lost a grip on what he was doing with the character , and I saw less of Alexander and more of Farrell . Sometimes , I suppose , that look in his eyes would just vanish , the kind of look that has been in the major , Dionetic performances of Stones ' films ( such as Willem Dafore in Platoon , Woody Harrellson in NBK , and Kilmer in The Doors ) . Alexander , after a first viewing , is my least favorite of Stone's pictures - much of it goes to lengths with historical exposition that might have fared better to show ( three battles , even if it was a small one or in montage , may have balanced out with the other major two ) than to go on and on with . It doesn't make the mistakes of this year's Troy , but it doesn't fare much better . Simply put , Alexander the film is like the man himself - an ambitious , crazed man who ended up dividing his audience . Go see it , and know you will be challenged to love , like , or despise it .
509529	453068	70707	10.0	" My brain ! . . . That's my second favorite organ . "	Woody Allen's Sleeper is one of his best films yet . The wit is , common for 70s era Allen , razor-sharp on the fronts of Woody's retorts and nervous ramblings , as well as in visual terms . Allen comes closest to taking the visual comedic spirit of the silent era , or of the first sound comedies , and making it fit perfectly into his work of pure absurdist science-fiction . There's never a wisecrack to miss , or a nod to political or social ties of the contemporary sort . In fact , there are almost TOO many sight gags to go around , like with the huge fruit and vegetables , or the orgasmatron , or the " Nose " , which is meant to be the leader of the dystopian future Allen gets thawed out of in the year 2173 . And by sort of stretching out of his New York skin , as he also did with Love and Death and Bananas to an extent ( though even more winningly here ) , there's some fresh ground to break . There's also some great team-work with Diane Keaton - the first time the two teamed up under Allen's direction . Topping this with a sensational up-beat rag-time jazz score by Allen and his band-mates ( the only time Woody's done the bit as composer ) , you've got great one-liners , great physical comedy , and superb , jokey production design . One of the best film of 1973 .
