508591	453068	420128	1.0	a total contrived aberration of a TV movie , not because of its sincerity , but . . . well , maybe that is a big part of it	Riding the Bus with My Sister is a shameless attempt to put up such an insane sequence of events into a two-hour-plus-commercials time slot to total up to this : Beth ( Rosie O'Donnell ) is inspiring and courageous and livens up those lives of people around her , and anyone who doesn't see otherwise can shove it . But the opposite is true , particularly due to the performance , though the writing doesn't help . It's not within the power of a filmmaker to make something that doesn't draws the viewer compassionately in , as LONG AS it doesn't try and think the viewers themselves are , to use the word bluntly , retarded . But Angelica Huston , who doesn't seem to do her late-father proud when it comes to taking the director's chair , plops on the sentiment when really what is being revealed is the wildly contrived story of a control freak who's mean and annoying and , at the end of it all , unsympathetic . This might be passing a lot of judgment on O'Donnell's character , who was based on a real person , but it's not without some notice . Beth might be one of the most irritating characters in recent memory , in TV or elsewhere . This doesn't mean some ( totally unintentional ) laughs aren't to be had at the expense of the totally dingbat turn from O'Donnell . Maybe it's method , maybe it's just playing it in a very horrific one-note way , but she doesn't do anything to help make this big goose who doesn't seem to notice that the ones who point out that she's loud and obnoxious might be the correct ones . No , the point of view of the filmmakers control that more than anything , wherein it's all either black or white : either people really respect and care for her ( the black tae-kwan-do student who has the Isaac Hayes look is never explained really as to why he's with her aside from ' she makes me laugh , I love her , blah blah ' ) , or they're dismayed by her rude quality , like when she's at the cafeteria the bus drivers are at and , after the umpteenth time she's been there , is yelled at by one of the other drivers to get out as it's the BUS DRIVERS section . It would be one thing if the writer tried to make this as some legitimate dramatic scene , but it's all played up like " people just don't understand , " which is accentuated by the whole relationship between the two sisters . Now , it's not that McDowell doesn't try a little with the part , but what is there to be given to her anyway ? Her part is meant as a lazy counterpoint to Beth's half-crazy half-stupid mindset . She's a career woman who is a photographer ( not very well apparently , even when she makes " arty " photos in black and white ) , who puts aside her career , and her boyfriend , to stay with Beth after the death of their father . Rainman , however , this surely is not ; the story has very little in the way of actual development , except for the most base and totally , despicably predictable points , with O'Donnell grinding on through in a performance that gives cringe-worthy a bad name ( or a good name , I guess ) . Even the flashbacks are ridiculously inept at showing anything aside from ' I didn't really care for my sister then , and I should've , as it took my father about my entire adolescence to move out of the house ' , in a gray Flags of Our Fathers tint of course . This is all capped off with a final section where Beth tries to contemplate having children . At this point , against my better judgment , I soldiered on to the end , with rests on a shot of Beth , her sister , and the " hot " bus driver all in a goofy pose . If you have the guts to go through it , just make sure to know there's many " laughs , tears , hugs , etc " , complete with the sappiest guitar pluckings this side of Eric Clapton after watching a puppy die , and an atmosphere of total dread where there should be some rays of happiness for these people for the audience . No such luck ; it's a Hallmark movie at its most exploitative .
509698	453068	299981	2.0	not at all undeserving of its straight-to-Sci-fi-channel-status	I just looked back at my notes on Highland : Endgame , still the only other Highlander movie I've yet to see ( also never seen an episode of the show ) , and an a little surprised at how high it was rated then even at a grade . I must have reacted to the final battle scene between Adrian Paul and Christopher Lambert , which is the only thing I can even recall from the one time seeing the film , and finding it kind of cool in a cheesy , disposable science-fiction flick manner . But the fact that it is so forgettable shouldn't be taken for granted , at the very least in what has come AFTER THE ENDGAME ! According to a friend each Highlander film gets even more disconnected and continuity confused than the last , and The Source is probably one of those textbook examples of a story being simply way too confusing for one who isn't at least a little familiar with the franchise . And at the same time , seeing it tonight on the Sci-fi cable channel , it's not totally out of place , and maybe not quite as offensive as some of the product made right in their home premises . But it's still a waste of any viewer's time , even for die-hard fans . The only real value at all to be taken from the movie , and there is maybe a little bit , may be in aspects , in parts , of craftsmanship , like the make-up on Pyramidhead and the cinematography , the latter calling into mind ( oddly enough as I'm not kidding ) Pan's Labyrinth , of course without much at all of the power of the context that film had in style and substance . But once that is past , then one is left with direction that seems to come out of a school that is based entirely on a time when MTV still made music videos , with touches of would-be 300 knock-off thrown in either as unintentional or as sucker-punching for genre fans . And acting that is just fair at best and atrocious at worst ( Adrian Paul can act , says who ? And the guy that plans the Pyramidhead , what gives ? ) But what made it most incredulous was the editing ; since the story is filled with many a cliché ( dying man gives his long monologue to teary-eyed hero , longer monologue from a disgusting creature about what is to come in the rest of the story , sex scene between hero and girl after a heart-to-heart , final duel , et all ) , the editing should at least try for professionalism of some sort . Not so . This director / editor team is about as toxic as Steven Tyler and Joe Perry in a 1978 hotel room loaded with five 8-balls a piece and a one hooker between the two of them . Often during a fight the characters will be shot as if in slow motion and SPED up , and then back and forth as if there isn't any conviction in just seeing simple fight choreography . But worse are the montages - aside from Bratz , which is in a league of its own , this is some of the just , well , inept editing I've seen in many a moon , particularly at the beginning and end where it seems as though nobody even watched the fing last ths of the movie that came before or after it ! The music is also another kicker to go with the director's scheme of assault on cinematic style . By the time it ends - which seems to be longer than it really is despite the long commercial breaks . The only good news that can come is that The Source has now been reached , and the series can now end , like another beheaded immortal or whatever the hell .
510516	453068	490204	3.0	Reinging and ringing over my head	It's basically impossible not to consider the tragedy of as the most significant event of a nightmare day on American soil . At the least it tore up New York city , and left many lives devastated . The writer / director of Reign Over Me , Mike Binder , tries to set up a form of critic-proof shield around his film by making the central tragedy for his protagonist that his family - wife , daughters - were killed on one of the planes in and for years has slipped into a horrible funk that has made him delusional and pretty close to schizophrenic . It's not using for a movie that is troubling ; films like United 93 and to a lesser extent World Trade Center benefited from facing the horror of the day head on . It's using it for this particular tragedy for this man's life . At first it's almost more of a plot device : since it was victims , the government paid out a huge amount to Charlie Fineman ( Sandler ) , so that he can still live in his apartment , refurnish the kitchen as he argued with his wife over on their last phone call , and play video games and jam out on classic rock without the worry of not having a job . Unlike , for example , the Fisher King , where the psychotic widower was also homeless , this solves the problem of dealing with monetary status . But then , as the character develops , it becomes more of a nuisance than anything . There's no depth developed within this situation aside from Charlie not dealing with the loss of his family , and what's explored in the friendship that's reconnected with Dr . Johnson ( Cheadle ) , his ex college roommate , is really bizarre and unamusing at the least and just plain stupid at worst . The way that the two connect rings false on counts of writing and directing , if not all the way on performance . Which leads to the two biggest flaws in this colossal waste , as the two feed into one another : Mike Binder's writing and Sandler's performance . I'm not one to say that Sandler can't act , on the contrary his turn in Punch-Drunk Love is revelatory , and I've even enjoyed him replaying practically the same persona in his string of comic star vehicles ( with a few obvious exceptions i . e . Click , Eight Crazy Nights ) . Here , however , he plays it all as incredulously one-note . You truly want to feel sympathy for the character - some will , to be sure - but Sandler blights this by not giving us anything to see that he wasn't always this cantankerous and crazy and demented . As clichéd as it might've been , albeit on top of the others included in the piece , a flashback wouldn't of hurt aside from the brief blips of his former life . It's such a misstep in perceiving tones of scenes , playing things for goofy laughs and drama sometimes in the same beat . Only a highly charged scene involving a gun carries any leverage in the acting department . But then the other problem , the writing , drives down most of the potential in the piece . I would be interested in seeing a film that explores some of the dimensions of a character coping with deep-rotted grief , yet not in this ham-fisted manner . On top of how Binder deals with Charlie's trauma , there's the friendship aspect , which attempts to pull some dimension for Cheadle's character . To his credit , Cheadle does give it his best , but much of the script asks him to go from being rational ( i . e . dealing with that on / off sexual harassment charge ) to being freewheeling and taking Charlie as a kind of guide to living how one wants to ( i . e . going against family ) . It becomes so frustrating that by the time some of the logical steps come closer - the psychiatric treatment Charlie does need , and is entitled to get - it's almost so out of reach for one to care from the blocks in the material . It's contrivance of plot details , it's contrivance of character , and it's a total sham and manipulation by the time of an unbelievable catharsis . It's simply not a good movie , or at the very least overrated .
508682	453068	377471	3.0	probably one of my least favorite films from 2005 ; not memorable at all	You might think with a cast as large as this , with a mix of big-name actors ( Travolta , Thurman , Keitel , Vaughn ) , music people and other pop culture people ( Andre Benjamin , The Rock , Cedric the Entertainer ) , that it might just be worth watching for them if not funny from the material . But it's not either much funny or really memorable for its cast . When presented with such a group of talent such as this , you know you'll either get something special or something of a downer , and its unfortunate that the latter applies . This is based on an Elmore Leonard book , but it didn't seem as if F . Gary Gray payed attention to getting the right rhythm in the comedy , or just getting the right people for the characters , as Barry Sonnenfeld did with his 1995 film Get Shorty . This time , basically , Chili Palmer ( Travolta ) is in the music industry instead of movies , and he gets involved with a woman ( Thurman sexy in her first scene , though not bringing much else throughout the film ) , and also through wanting to get an R & B singer ( Christina Milan ) to the attentions of producers . But , of course , there are problems on the crime end of the spectrum , involving Keitel and Vaughn , and the Rock . Unfortunately , I can't really tell you much else I can recall from Be Cool , as the story itself isn't much of interest . A couple of individual jokes and lines here and there might muster up a laugh or a grin , but nothing amounts to much , and the filmmaker doesn't seem capable of balancing the varying styles that the actors might be able to bring along with the cooky , deterring story . It's a movie also more concerned with its supporting characters than its lead ( s ) . And one might start to feel a little bit of grimace as Travolta and Thurman once again shake it up on the dance floor , but with something missing from their first outing over a decade ago . Be Cool isn't an unpleasant experience , but it borders on it , as the comedy often hits flatter than expected , and even an actor like Keitel , who I would see in just about anything , can't bring anything to his part . You know there's something a little off when the Rock provides more laughs than anyone else in the picture .
508278	453068	285531	3.0	not a pleasant experience as I remember it	Lawrence Kasan doing an adaptation of a Stephen King novel ; you'd think that the man who was in part responsible for Raiders of the Lost Ark and Empire Strikes Back , and directed a good film or two in his time , would be able to make a memorable work by the author . It is memorable , in it's way , but not really as the author might've intended . Or maybe it is ; maybe it's such a gross-out factor in Dreamcatcher that had King trudge through this . But maybe another problem with adaptating a book like this , another of his I've yet to read , is that it's immense in size and scope ( from what I remember from seeing the size of in in hardcover , a dictionary almost ) . But whatever the reason , Dreamcatcher is a mess , and not just in what pops up on screen from the one-hour mark onward . It starts off promisingly , with a couple of flashback scenes to a childhood setting where the main male characters have a particular struggle , and a ' special ' person is helped by them , and also helps them in return . This has that element of King writing kids that always works well , a tinge of Stand By Me there with an added brush of humanism . Then the story shifts to the friends reuniting in a cabin up in a snowbound mountain . Things seem honky-dory , but they soon turn ugly , very ugly , and then , well , here comes the real juicy parts . What starts off as a story with some interesting fantasy elements involving a ' dreamcatcher ' , something that binds together these characters thoughts somehow , goes off into a crazy alien invasion story . The aliens are dealt with in a very nasty manner , and not in a kind of fun-nasty manner that has been done in other science fiction films or stories . I could deal with the way the aliens first sort of , erm , surface , which involves a part of the body I'd rather not mention here . But then it infects one or two of the others , and it turns one definitely into a kind of bizarre schitzo homicidal maniac who also happens to ride around on the snow on a jet-ski . Then the government gets involved , with Morgan Freeman popping up in one of the very rare times I had displeasure watching him in a movie . He can be the greatest of actors in this day and age , but the character - an obsessive general on the hunt at any cost for the aliens - is beneath him , and any sense he tries to bring to the part gets swept away by the muckedy muck of the story around him . Would I recommend Dreamcatcher even as a so-bad-it's-good horror movie ? Probably not even as that . There were a few moments I could remember , when I finally gave myself away from any sense of reality and turned over to the delirium of the second half of the movie , and it was funny to a degree that was almost cheating but still goofy . But those moments are few and far between . The film overall is a muddle , a lurid take on a story where the characters are set-up OK , and then knocked down or turned on their hinges as what was neat to start with soon evaporates . And one wonders if it's more to blame on Kasdan / screenwriter William Goldman's end , who tried to take on the large-scale scope of King's work , or the actual source material itself . Apparently it was the book that King wrote after suffering from being hit by a car years ago , perhaps as his sort of therapy back to his old writing chops . Which is fine - but for it to be this , and from a man far more talented than such manic , searching - for - scares - other - than - gore tactics like in Dreamcatcher . In short , not a pleasant experience .
510412	453068	222817	3.0	a good lot like Porno Holocaust , only even more misogynistic and with badly dubbed ( Japanese ) sex scenes !	Maybe it was the title , or the trailer ( certainly not the interview on the DVD , which is with the director as he keeps saying " hi , kids " into the camera like a buffoon ) , but I had expectations for Entrails of a Virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal , bloody killings by a weird Japanese penetrator . Turns out it's way too sleazy for its own good , or bad , or whatever . There's a problem - and one can see this also in the Italian sexploitation flick Porno Holocaust , similar to this in many respects - in not having balance to the sex and violence . Too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno , and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies ! And with the killing scenes , there has to be at least a little tack , and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity , in creating the creature / killer / whatever . Entrails of a Virgin has neither . It's safe to say it's a pretty soulless movie , even if isn't one of the very worst ever made - it's there just for horn-dog Japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their ' other ' heads . In this case , we're given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls , nothing too salacious , and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by " A Murderer " as he's credited . First off , the director Kazuo ' Gaira ' Komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on - we get spliced in ( or phoned in , take your pick ) clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere . It looks like it's from another movie . Then once settled into the house , there's a ' wrestling ' scene that's poorly choreographed and shot ( yeah , we really need to see him ' all ' there ) , and then on to the rape and killings . First the rape , by the photographers , who promise the girls some jobs for their time . Then the Murderer , who like D'Amato's creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial , and who for an unknown reason kills the men and / or rapes the women one by one . Now , the latter of those , taken by themselves , should be considered the highlights of the movie . This is like saying , however , that the croûtons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad . An eye-gouging scene , a spike thrown like an Olympic event ( that scene , actually , is kind of cool ) , and finally the entrailing of the overly sex-crazed girl , whose inconsequential name I can't remember . Even this becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title ! On top of this , the sex scenes , which become tedious through ' Gaira ' and his indulgence in long-takes-without-cutaways where everything by the Japanese censors is blurred anyway , are dubbed over by the actors ( you'd think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough , hence the need to let them ' speak ' for themselves ) . But the overall feeling from Entrails of a Virgin is that of a lumpy one , where it's just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror ( watch as the last girl left alive , the virgin of the picture , tries to stop the murderer from getting to her , which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him ! ) You just want it to be done with , for the ' I hate women ' mantra to ease up or be rid altogether .
509012	453068	859163	3.0	just one more big-time money maker with no soul and mundane ( though continuous ) action	I guess I remember liking the first two Mummy movies well enough ( matter of fact if I look back at my old reviews they might have been given a piece ) , but at the same time I never remember having a desire to re-watch the movies either after seeing them once as a big-time summer blockbuster as a teenager . With Mummy 3 , they're not even trying anymore , and simply isn't worth your time let alone your money . It's just soulless Hollywood product propped up to try and squeeze any drops left in a franchise that is a reboot of the original 1930's Mummy series . In short , it's a little like the Transformers of 2008 , although I don't even think this will have its defenders like Bay's cluster-f . Now , granted , I wasn't expecting anything really spectacular - frankly it's hard to imagine Dark Knight being topped for pure excitement as a summer movie - but here it's just dumb , and not always the kind of ' fun ' dumb that I was hoping for ( or that might be attempted by the writers ) . It's basically a rehash of the plot of Hero , and ironically stars Jet Li and Maggie Cheung as the main players , and Li plays this Dragon emperor who wanted to take over the world and was ruthless but got frozen in time . His curse is unlocked , however , in the 1940s , and set to reign all over again with his ' mummy ' army . Then steps in the O'Connell family ( Brendan Fraser , Maria Bello inexplicably replacing Rachel Weisz , and Luke Ford as son Alex ) to get back in action once again to try and stop this mummy invasion . . . again . To try and go for any plot is more than just moot ; in the past movies , for all is homaging ( or just ripping off ) of Indiana Jones movies and old-time matinée serials , there were some original ideas and visuals and action set pieces . This time , it's all just a continual loop of Indiana Jones rip-offs ( a friend of mine repeatedly whispered " oh no , it's not from Raiders " or " it's not from Last Crusade " sarcastically ) . There's almost no real invention , even as the climax goes for ANOTHER rip-off ( 300 , anyone ? ) , and the one cool part of the movie - the Yetties ( is that how its spelled ) who are big , hilarious abominable snowmen - lasts all too short an amount of time to have any fun . The rest of the running time is used up for corny , un-funny " jokes " and dialog , false romantic sub-plots , and a performance from Jet Li that is practically non-existent ( and , in fact , he's mostly a skeleton for half the running time despite getting second billing ) . Did I mention the new addition , Luke Ford , is so bland and annoying that he makes Brendan Fraser a charisma magnet ? It's simply another studio piece of ' whatever ' , not a total bomb but without a shred of invention or intelligence in the writing or direction . If it's on TV , watch it for a minute and decide what's going on . But it's bound to be a disappointment even for those who somehow have a nostalgia ( yeah , nostalgia within a decade ) for Mummy and Mummy Returns .
510213	453068	82199	3.0	" He is not an agent of the C . I . A . , he is a writer of comic books ! "	This is a kid's movie that I wonder how it could have even appealed to me as a kid back when it first had a little more , uh , technical relevance I suppose ? Actually , no , I wouldn't guess so , if at all ever ? Was it a tax write-off ? Or maybe the filmmakers took too many drugs and drinks while watching James Bond and Pink Panther movies ? Or maybe they knew what they were getting into and thought they could still pull off a legitimately entertaining movie for the whole family . I really have no idea how I would've reacted to this is I were a kid , but as a twenty-something , me and the friends I watched it with became practically the Mystery Science Theater guys , heckling and making up lines as it went along . And , in truth , I might've done it even if I was watching it alone . It's camp without knowing it , or if it does know it maybe it's all the smarter for it . But it does try to pass itself off as something for the kiddies when really it's just too ridiculous and inane for anyone . Maybe the title gives it away , but there you have it - he's a man , but he's also a condor , get it ? Well , to put it plainly if I can , Woody Wilkins ( Michael Crawford ) is ambivalent for about a second to take his ' Condorman ' idea to the next step - to team up with the CIA ! His mission is to stop a Russian terrorist , played by Oliver Reed , while also with the seductive Ruskie ' Bear ' ( Barbara Carrera ) . That's really all you need to know , oh wait , there's more : there's a lead henchman with an eye-patch , or is that a marble eye , or both ? How about big gargantuan title cards to introduce every single locale ( though sometimes , like with the alps scenes , becoming a little confusing again ) ? Or massive explosions ? I think that might sum it up . But really , if you seek out the movie , you should know what to expect not just from the title but from just the LOOK on the cover of the DVD or VHS . It might be one thing if British director Charles Jarrott went for such silly subject matter with more gusto , but it's almost as if he KNOWS how goofy this is , and has car chases that just spring out of nowhere , plus a climactic speed-boat challenge where even more big explosions happen ( and the ratio of the henchmen who jump off the boats before explosion and those who stay on during it is maybe and ) . In other words , it was perfect as a kind of film to rag on , to put it mildly . It might be one thing if it was so good it's bad , but it turns it it's so mediocre it's just , well , bad . It's got heroes and villains that put out dialog that sometimes is a little incoherent , the bumbling sidekick who is SUPPOSED to be a CIA agent , and that darn one-eyed henchmen , come together in a film where said Condorman only takes flight for less than four minutes ! If anything kind can be said about it , it's at least not a boring bad movie , where its so relentless with cheesiness that it becomes wearisome . It's almost too whacked out to get dull at any one point . It is consistent in trying to be entertaining when it really isn't , however it thus becomes on the flip-side entertaining again as fodder for the sort of slings and fun that would make Statler & Waldorf of the Muppets die to dig in on . It's simply one of the most unintentionally funny movies of the 80s , at least from Disney .
510320	453068	118747	4.0	mostly a disappointment	John Landis ' Blues Brothers 2000 has a ridiculous plot that goes nowhere ( at least the original had somewhat a plot to get money to save a church ) and is dumb to enough of a degree to warrant it almost as patched-together in a coffee-shop over three nights . Also , for die hard fans of the original , they will feel a great , unavoidable void where John Belushi fit in the original as Jake Blues ( Belushi is dead ) . So that's the disappointment . And there are others , including the inevitable rehashing by Landis and Aykroyd of the past plot line almost to a T with extra fluff like the responsibility factor , whatever that is , put upon Jake and the kid . The car chases , too , are only so-so when compared to the audacity and bizarre originality of the first film's chases ( good for their time , and almost too simple and predictable to do twenty years later ) . But the film isn't totally irredeemable - it almost sets itself up NOT to be by overloading with various Blues icons both old and not so old . So the climactic big performance featuring a who's who of blues and rock musicians is almost worth seeking out the film to see , at least if you're a fan . But it is definitely hit ( very narrow hit ) or very much a miss for original fans of the SNL series and ( compared to this ) absolute post-modern 1980 classic comedy . That it only provides a few solid laughs make it all the more dreary , a sign of Landis's decline from his high peak in the 80's . Cameos include Frank Oz , Darrell Hammond , BB King , Steve Lawrence , Eric Clapton , Erykah Badu , Aretha Franklin , Isaac Hayes , Dr . John , Steve Winwood , John Popper ( Blues Traveler ) , and James Brown as the always awesome Reverend Cleophus James ( who actually provides the funniest part of the film after the end credits ! )
508180	453068	478087	4.0	want to take a gamble ? this movie STINKS !	Robert Luketic , director of 21 , doesn't have as his major folly to change the characters from the book ( which I have not read but heard a bit about ) from an all Asian group of card counters in Las Vegas to a more ' mixed ' lot ( i . e . about are Asian now ) . Nor is it even his casting of his lead actor ( Jim Sturgess probably brings more charm to the two-dimensional part than one would've thought was possible ) . His biggest folly was not questioning as he went through the motions of making a silly , contrived , hyper - slick - music - video - shot - in - Jiminy - Jilikers - High - def if there was anything to change up on an audience who knows such motions through and through . The only thing that might differentiate this movie from a whole host of smart-guy-in-a-new-dirty-pond flicks ( and I can't name them all but the likes of Rounders is a masterpiece compared to this ) is that the characters turn into models from GQ and Maxim by the time they hit it big in Vegas . Not expecting much from 21 is just about right , or even worse . And don't get me started on Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Spacey . It's a paycheck day once again for these two very good - sometimes even fabulous - thespians , who slum their roles as a would-be-DeNiro-in-Casino and a shady MIT professor who by the looks of the movie should be characterized as team-leader-Satan respectively . They too understand what is going on in 21 , which is an ol ' fish-out-of-water fable about smart people doing stupid things with lots of money at stake as an MIT kid ( Srugess ) with aspirations for Harvard med joins a group that goes to Vegas and stakes out hundreds of thousands per weekend by counting cards and hustling from table to table . I guess , in a way , I don't blame them for not doing much at all with their roles . But one would hope that there would be something , ANYTHING , that would make this as something for them to distinguish , that the director & / or the script would give them something to do aside from filling in pat performances from at least a good few other parts they've played . As mentioned , Sturgess at least brings a little bit of interest to a character carved out of some sympathy as kid who gets in way over his head . There's not much else with supporting players either . Kate Bosworth is the kind of actress whom you think can sort of act , or at least knows how to pretend to really act . But there's also something just not there clicking , something when she puts on the ' concerned ' face that just screams so bland that you can't even take it . The writers also plug in clichés of yester-year ( and not long enough ) : Jacob Pitts as the snotty side character in the group who is just too jealous and stubborn to stay in the group long once Benn arrives ; the old nerdy friends from before Ben's trip into blackjack land , who are there as a function and not as any real character ' base ' . And then there is the script in and of itself - giving us such forlorn twists and turns in its final reels that I want to choke on my popcorn - and the direction as well , which pumps up the volume for the kids while making sure to completely sanitize a real Vegas experience for college-aged younguns ( and , of course , the shallowest of all , the two hot male and female leads have to hook up , without much connection whatsoever ) . Maybe you could give it a couple of quick peeks , maybe five minutes , when it's on TNT in a couple of years . But as far as giving any substantial money to this enterprise ? The house wins , Johnny , that's the way it is .
510980	453068	66286	5.0	good for a curio , not so much as a exploitation / biker flick	The Rebel Rousers a few times feels like it could be aiming for something more on its lunch-money used for a budget . It's got a very simple crux to the story - Bruce Dern and Cameron Mitchell as old school friends ( hey , they may be oh two decades apart , but it was college I guess ) say hello and go their separate ways at the start of the film , the former being a biker club leader and the latter a soon-to-be father of a possibly illegitimate child by Diane Ladd's character . Then , some of the bikers one day find the two in a car , take them down to a beach , and beat the crap out of him for just , well , being there . He slugs off to get help while the other bikers race to see who'll get their ' time ' with her , with Jack Nicholson's Bunny ( ho-ho ) vies for the prize . This crux is given some actors who actually say very basic lines of dialog with some conviction and faith in the material , but not much . Some of the acting , or at least casting , is a little strange though . Nicholson is given the top billing on most VHS releases of the film , but his is a supporting role that is like RP McMurphy from Cuckoo's nest with his wonderful sarcasm replaced by striped pants ( which the director decides to use to block some shots ) . There's also the versatile Harry Dean Stanton among the pack , with possibly the most ridiculous get-up in his whole career . It all leads up to a climax that includes a fight , but also a letdown in not having the bikers square off against the Mexicans who show up with their pitchforks on the beach after finally being alerted . All of this is up for good times in the B-movie guilty pleasure sense by the sound of it , and everything that can be made as ' surface ' as possible is used for dramatic or just ' there ' effect ; Mitchell and Ladd's characters have not much else to say except the baby and marriage ; the bikers , aside from Dern and possibly Nicholson ( who when he does have a line or something to do is very funny ) , are hard to discern with any distinguishing characteristics ; the police are ( amusingly ) very limited to a Deputy who's never around and a lummox with bricks for brains . There's even a very good scene where Mitchell gets no response from a bar full of patrons even in his beat-up , bloodied state . But the problem with all of the expended effort put into The Rebel Rousers is that it's too amateurish to be taken at all seriously as a fun time , if that makes sense . Producer / writer / director Martin B . Cohen seems to understand point and shoot ( and the previously mentioned stripe-pants blocking shots ) , and not much else . There is also the issue of lighting , to which it looks like the filmmakers didn't have enough money for or just didn't give a crap about - the climax is a letdown mostly for how you can't see a damn thing that's going on . It's ironic to think that Laslo Kovacs went from Easy Rider to this ( or vice versa ) . His music choices are mostly awful , at least a few supporting actors brought on look like they're improvising on the set ( and not for the better of the actual script ) , and any real guilty fun ( ala Angels Hard as They Come ) of seeing a bunch of bikers being really mean and ruthless is compounded by the Mitchell / Ladd moments which are un-evenly paced . But even with all of this , as a pre-Easy Rider kind of spectacle ( shot before it but not released till after it came out , a shelved movie for three years ) , it's not bad to look at as a curio piece for some of its main players . For fans of the actors who got their feet wet in these kinds of pictures it's of a little interest to see Dern as the unlikely protagonist and Nicholson as the grizzly heel , or Stanton in his sometimes whacked out state . That it leaves no real lasting impression is no surprise though , aside from being a mixed bag .
509220	453068	364955	5.0	a film where satire and drama don't mix well	Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes , director and writer of Art School Confidential ( second meeting after Ghost World ) , have here a perplexing convergence of sensibilities . It's a film that I really wanted to like more than I ended up doing so . It has a premise that is not bad at all . A suburban kid constantly picked on as a kid ( and virgin ) goes to an odd-ball ( and usual kind of ) art school , where he meets people who are , admittedly by the film itself , walking clichés . And for the first half hour , give or take , I thought the satire ( and , more importantly in this case , laughs ) that Zwigoff and Clowes were aiming for went off splendidly . There are some funny vignettes showing the young Jerome ( Max Minghella , whom I'll get to next paragraph ) trying to adjust to this new world , where he has troubles finding the right girl , and in general to his fellow drawing classmates as they mouth off as the pretentious being brilliance . BUT , then the storyline takes a bit of a detour , and it along with the characters never fully recover . The problem I see reminded me of why another film that targeted a specific group in-wind of an institution-kind of setting , so to speak , like Election , worked well and this didn't . Not to compare too much as they're different films , while Election could work in balancing out some of the more dramatic aspects with the satire , Art School Confidential just couldn't . As the filmmakers get more into the love story portion of the film , then into the serial killer storyline ( involving characters with secrets soon revealed ) , one realizes that a ) what little satire is left is overwhelmed by the dourness that accompanies the darker side of Jerome's descent into art-school hell , and b ) its star Minghella just can't pull it off totally . As an actor he often has a look on his face and in his eyes that's very much the same scene to scene , close to being on the verge of weeping outright ( yes , even more than Jake Gyllenhall in his earlier years ) . Overall his work isn't awful , but there's more needed for this rather simplistic character - when it comes down to it ( and , admittedly , clichéd but not an interesting kind ) - and is outranked by other superior actors like Malkovich and Broadbent . Maybe some might find more wit in the film's later half than I did , but even the ending that tries to put one more satirical point in the works , seems like its been in other films before . And there are a couple of points logistically in the story that just don't work ( i . e . certain particulars that one once SOBER could see put on the paintings ) . Despite a few bright spots early on , and some cutting wit and clever jabs at the ponderousness of how art school's work ( with some of the best material from Ethan Suplee's sub-plot as a struggling filmmaker ) , it's a disappointment coming from this writer / director duo . For all the possibilities that could be open with such material , only a few are realized .
509294	453068	109813	5.0	I guess it's fair	I saw this film again on TV one night , and while it looks entertaining for kids , adults will want to reckon back to the days of the TV show ( or maybe just the Honeymooners ) . The actors are somewhat credible here , with Rick Moranis always getting some laughs as Barney , but hey , that might be it here . Not great , but it is a whole lot better than the sequel at least .
508508	453068	1179891	5.0	Grindhouse trash that should be trashier , but it'll do in 3	Word of advice : don't go to see My Bloody Valentine in a regular theater . Or even on DVD unless if it's just with a bunch of friends with some beer . It may be ironic of me , but even at just 2 stars I would recommend seeing My Bloody Valentine the remake as it is advertised : in 3D . The filmmakers know that this is trash from the get-go , and they decide the best way to pump it up with horror movie steroids is to make people put on the glasses and create an onslaught of senseless and tasteless killing scenes that try to find new ways to kill people with axes . On this level the picture is respectable as trash , but in a way they almost don't go far enough : on a scale of 1 to 10 this movie is a 7 , even with the 3D . What this needed to be was the most god-awful piece of crap ever , with horrible dialog and violence that could offend the most liberal mother out there . Instead it's . . . another slasher movie with some splashy special effects . This also means please , for the love of Pete , do not go into this expecting anything in way of story or characters . The whole gist of the story is this : " WHO " is the miner killer stalking people on Valentine's Day 10 years after his supposed death / disappearance ? Is it this gentlemen who has come back to town since leaving 10 years ago ? hmm . . . I wouldn't hope that would spoil anything , but who's to say I did ? Maybe for some who haven't been too exposed to many horror or slasher movies this mystery may act tricky and keep them guessing . For everyone else , it's just plain ol ' stupid and leading up to an ending that is second only to Saw III as being most idiotic " Flashback-Explains-Everything " kind of resolution . But then again , why would anyone watch this for things like performances ( though , oddly enough , not all of them are completely terrible , which adds to the frustration of the script being true " blah " ) ? It's an excuse to just throw up newly refined killings and some cheesy dialog and random appearances and JUMP surprises , and from a remake of a horror movie from the 80s that has a spotty record with fans anyway , and on those terms it's not quite as bad as you might expect . Or , perhaps , it is as bad as you'd expect , but it was hard for me not to laugh incredibly through the whole 3D experience . It's great fun as a near guilty pleasure ride , and what it looks to be in every other aspect .
510471	453068	55946	5.0	Arch Hall Sr's crowning achievement ! wait , it's his only movie as a director !	Although it's tempting to give weird dog of a motion picture , by proxy of Mystery Science Theater 3000 , which may or may not be the only available version right now , it goes all the way to being a classic . They make this very random precursor to Encino Man , with hints of quality that might've inspired Hal Warren , work much better than it would without . WATCH OUT FOR SNAKES ! It's the suspenseful story of a young man and young woman ( well , young man depending on point of view , as Hall Jr himself plays the lead character Tom Nelson , with his wacky pompadour and scrunched face ) who go out to a desert valley , but as Tom sings a song ( with random singing voices playing in the background ) , poor Roxy is taken away to the cave of a caveman where , oddly enough , her father is also waiting . The caveman - dubbed Eegah for his bouts of grunts equaling that word - shows off his wares , which are just corpses all lined up , and as he starts to get more and more attracted to Roxy Tom finally goes on the lookout to find her . WATCH OUT FOR SNAKES ! Meanwhile , she shaves Eegah , she and her father escape , and Eegah goes in pursuit in random long takes where Eegah pursues as the car won't work driving in his direction ! Even more odd than this , somehow after how many hundreds of thousands of years of Eegah's existence , he finds his way to the small town Tom and Roxy are in , and wreaks havoc on everyone in town ( well , not everyone , there's not enough balance for that ) . Not sure if this will give you an idea of what the movie's about , as there isn't much ' about ' it , except that it's young kids who sing , go ' wee ' in a car , and have to have existential tidings with a caveman , including a shaving of his fake beard , and some possible controversy in the town when they return . It's very lame - WATCH OUT FOR SNAKES ! - and doesn't always make much sense , which is good that the MSTK3000 commentary comes in . It turns what it otherwise the purest form of an ultra low-budget not-quite B-movie lark into a really hilarious trip . They keep repeating the phrase that appears seemingly out of nowhere despite it being credited to a line from Hall Sr , " WATCH OUT FOR SNAKES " , this despite the fact that there is only ONE shot of snakes ; we see more footage of lizards having sex and gila monsters crawling around then we do snakes , which adds to incredibly to it being sort of unintentional comic genius ala God complex . You may even want to join in with friends to say it at random times . So , get ready to see some graceful club-waving , lavishly dated pop guitar playing and singing by Hall Jr and Henry Prince ( that pool scene is absolutely golden ) , and jump-cuts that give Godard a run for his innovator money . WATCH OUT FOR SNAKES !
508727	453068	382625	6.0	maybe the best that could be done from the book - a contrived-to-hell ( no pun intended ) blockbuster with some merit	What can I say that has already be said about Dan Brown's international smash book about the deepest " secret " in Christianity ? Having read only part of it ( as it is , arguably of course , an airplane book with a hugely elevated status over controversy and popularity ) , I can say that the movie , directed by Ron Howard and with a cast of French , American and British all-stars , does what it means to do . It brings some food-for-thought , with enough exposition for three typical Hollywood movies . And , at times , Howard and company ( i . e . screenwriter Akiva Goldsman ) shave off a couple of parts in Brown's writing that aren't necessary while keeping the thoughtful ( as well as , dare I say , silly ) nature of the writing . As it is , the Da Vinci Code DOES have a plot that is structured well enough - a symbol specialist , Robert Langdon ( Tom Hanks in a role that basically calls for the basics of his talents , no more no less ) , is drawn into a case of murders , a conspiracy involving secret , ultra-dangerous sects of the Catholic church ( with a creepy villain in Paul Bettany's character ) , and a search for an item as old as Christianity itself . The film traces parts of Europe for the hunt , and along the way there is information compulsively expounded upon about the secrets behind the murders , the symbols , the clues , and how the entire history of the Jesus Christ is possibly - dare the filmmaker / authors say - corrupted and a lie . So it is here that the controversy has been brought through . But the controversy is no more understandable than it was for films like Dogma and The Last Temptation of Christ ; religious groups are BOUND to get sensitive by material that faces against their sternly stringent views . That it's transferred into a murder mystery / thriller that has more twists than the International House of Pretzel puts it up for everyone to contemplate . What helps make the film watchable even as the story goes through more contrivances and surprises than I'd care to count ( with the core being a suspension of disbelief of both plot turns and the exposition bits ) is the cast assembled . The bulk of the players - Ian McKellan , Alfred Molina , Audrey Tatou , and Jean Reno - are the best that could have been cast , and all that are asked of them are to say the dialog with enough conviction and believability to not be totally dull or just , well , wrong . While the direction by Howard and his crew is not the most imaginative , he is able to serve all of the " so-called " facts and ideas to use without making it into the overly pretentious . While I wouldn't think of this at all of being a great film or with the ambition even to BE one , it at least tries to have the skills of the common Hollywood thriller while serving up more facts than the same thriller wouldn't think to touch . To put it another way - this is basically Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade with half of the adventure , and more than half of the historical and religious implications amplified . As Ebert said , is " preposterously entertaining " , and to take it as 100 % serious is missing what is aimed for , even if not entirely successful .
510747	453068	65401	6.0	as much to find fun and amusing as to nitpick , decent AIP flick that could be more	Angel Unchained has the ingredients of your basic AIP picture - bikers , ' cowboys ' ( rednecks ) , hippies , and lots of action . Unfortunately , it isn't entirely synthesized . Perhaps I could've known this by seeing it had been re-rated a PG-13 by the MPAA , but I also thought ' hosh-posh , it still probably has that real violent , grungy feel of dueling off between the forces of hicks and bikers ' . Turns out the cooler elements of the film , some of which are some of the more amusing and awesomely bad moments from AIP biker movies , are juxtaposed against a core of a story that's kind of tame , even soft . It's actually got a Seven Samurai-style story to it , with the roles of the bandits and samurai reversed here - this time it's the so-called bandits ( bikers ) fighting off against the good-old boys ( cowboys ) . This starts off some interest even as knock-off material . The acting as well is not that terrible , at least for what's required on such an ultra-low budget . Regulars like Don Stroud and Luke Askew are dependable ( more so Askew who the year before had a memorable role in Easy Rider ) , though Tyne Daly , a strange early part for her before The Enforcer and later Judging Amy , keeps the love story a little too mellow for its own good . Angel ( Stroud ) wants to get away just for a little while from his old gang , so he hooks up with Daly's character and starts working at a commune / farm , complete with dazed bearded help and a token Native American with a special ' mix ' of cookies . But as they get terrorized by cowboys on go-carts ( yes , go-carts , one of the real highlights of the movie ) , Angel enlists the help of his biker gang , with some consequences that unfold . All of this is tricky material , and the co-writer / director Lee Madden isn't totally able to balance out the scenes and moments ( and just visual sights like with Bill McKinney's retro glasses ) with the sappier parts . The latter of which also includes a soundtrack that borders on soft-rock , the specifically wrong tone that suddenly makes the material quite dated . So , if you're looking for lots of carnage , immoral action , and the stomping out of almost everything in sight , you might be disappointed . Even as there is a neat B-movie style climax involving go-carts vs . bikers that does garner up excitement and laughs , the very end adds a point to what ends up being the lesser qualities of the film . It's intentions are swell , but it gets confused as whether it should be more hippie or biker style , with the poor Injun ( yes , that's his character name ) caught in the middle . Worth watching once , especially for genre fans , but not top-shelf AIP material .
508502	453068	455538	6.0	How to Make Occasional Sharp Satire & Drab Romantic Comedy	One would think that a director usually makes the difference in distinguishing the material from other , more standard fare . Robert Weide , while working mostly in TV , has over 2 dozen Curb Your Enthusiasm episodes to his credit , and as such one might think he would be prime material to direct some solid satire . Yet perhaps for Wiede it's the writing that makes the difference , ultimately , or just based on some of the actors he works with . Simon Pegg is no Larry David , but on his own Pegg is very funny and with the right material ( notably that with collaborator Edgar Wright ) has created some exceptional British parodies . He's also got a strange charm to him , an affecting wit , and delivery that is up to snuff with other American actors he's working with here . But he can't completely overcome the screenplay . How to Lose Friends and Alienate people is about a wildman writer / editor at a cultish British magazine , and gets some tabloid buzz about bringing a pig to an awards show and getting totally smashed in the process . He grabs the attention of a once-maverick editor of a prestigious Manhattan magazine ( Jeff Bridges ) , who hires him in part because ( according to Pegg ) he reminds him of his younger self . But he never gets an article published , at least without some hassle , and he also has some stiff competition with an older rival , and an attractive editor ( Kirsten Dunst ) , not to mention an insatiable , sexy Megan Fox as a typically snooty celebrity gearing up for an awards-worthy part as a nun in a movie . To the credit of the cast and the director , it is a watchable effort , at least for those who may be able to spot references to La Dolce Vita ( as if it weren't nailing it a little over the head ) , and occasionally there are some really big laugh out-loud gags ( one I'll remember for a long while involves a prank call for a bunch of call-girls into the office of prickly a-hole Lawrence Maddox played by Danny Huston ) . But the actual love-interest angle with Pegg and Dunst is at best competent and at worst just weak and predictable with a few drunken melancholy scenes thrown in for good measure , and the likes of Bridges , Gillian Anderson ( as Fox's stand-offish but shallow agent ) and Fox herself playing on a theme of discontented " hot " talents are usually at the mercy of a screenplay that only intermittently gives them things to latch on to . I wouldn't mind seeing large parts of it on TV again , especially for some of Pegg's stinging barbs of dialog , but it's a partial disappointment .
508754	453068	51500	6.0	this rare find is completely watchable on one level , almost in spite of itself . . .	You'd know why you'd want to find this film , as it's the ultra-low budget , barely-a-drive-in quickie that features the great Jack Nicholson in his feature debut at the tender age of 21 ( he was a mailman at MGM in his previous years in Hollywood ) . He plays a youth out of control , though also under duress . He's taken a woman and kid hostage , and outside the crowd builds in anticipation as the cops struggle to find a compromise to get everyone safely out . The film is complete with a theme song that just repeats ' cry-cry-cry , cry-baby killer ' , and in a style that is as polished as a junkyard dog . The story itself , by the way , is told in a way that is so simplistic and with over-acting ( or maybe too trying-to-be-realistic acting ) that is typical of this kind of un-pretentiously kind of fare . But the reason in the end to reach into the recesses of ebay or elsewhere to find it is to see Nicholson in his early larval stage of a career , and somehow he does make the work fascinating to watch . Obviously not his best by a long-shot , and his first big break in the B-world would come later in Little Shop of Horrors and even later in Easy Rider . However I did like how he was keeping his scenes pretty well grounded , keeping to the situation at hand with all of the confusion and shattered rebellion that's in a youth of his real age . It's almost like checking out the Beatles when they were still the Quarry Men or something - it's not necessarily ' good ' , but you might be surprised at how it's not really bad either .
509742	453068	465624	6.0	decent enough entertainment for what you might expect	Ivan Reitman unfortunately ( today ) doesn't have the real goods on directing spectacular fantasy comedies that work for all ages and can rake in the huge bucks . It's not that he's become a bad director , but that in an age where the ' Frat pack ' grosses nearly 100 million or more at a clip with each film they put out , his kind of comedy is a near-dying breed . This being said , I was glad - if not enthralled - to see My Super Ex-Girlfriend , a pleasant diversion that gives some good moments on its one-joke premise . It boasts also some very good performances from Uma Thurman as the ultra-neurotic and high-strung Jenny Johnson aka G-Girl , who can be as nuts as she is sweet and dangerous as heroic , and even Luke Wilson playing a typical kind of role with his sort of charm and off-handed way of playing scenes . Anna Faris from Scary Movie is decent enough too , if not much to work with character-wise , as the real flame of the story . Even Eddie Izzard pops in as the ' Arch Nemesis ' of the picture . Even with a premise as catchy as the one for My Super Ex-Girlfriend , only so much is made up from it . And there are , needless to say for an Ivan Reitman comedy , some really funny moments . One of them is when Thurman's G-girl persuades the reluctant Wilson to get it on while in mid-flight up in her super-duper grasp in the sky . Even the shark bit , which can be seen countless times on the TV ads , is amusing . Unfortunately , Reitman's writer doesn't really mine enough chances for bigger laughs aside from mostly sexual gags an innuendo , and the performance by the buddy of Wilson's , played by Rainn Wilson ( no relation ) is an under-cooked character of hormonal ties that keep him tethered as the hapless advice giver that really isn't too smart or of as much enjoyment as other characters . Indeed , that might've been my biggest beef with the film was that parts of the story - which Reitman obviously cares about and does make interesting past the gags - becomes undercooked in the last act , and ultimately very transparent . It becomes somewhat of a struggle to care about these people , even amid absurd situations , which was never really a problem in other more successful Reitman films . My Super Ex-Girlfriend does provide enough good gags and humor , decently professional craftsmanship ( no quick editing , with the special effects kept grounded enough not to get too goofy or off the wall ) , and it's a fair bit of summertime fun for audiences . That it is less than the sum of its parts isn't too surprising though .
507981	453068	114367	6.0	a combination of Phillip K Dick and Dan O'Bannon in a better than average / less than great sci-fi flick	Screamers is like one of those made-for-HBO science fiction programmers from the mid 90s , except that there's some brighter things going for it . One of these is that it's based on a short story by one of the hallmark authors of science fiction , Philip K Dick , and another is that the script mostly got work done ( and seems most noticeable ) by Dan O'Bannon , writer behind Alien and Return of the Living Dead . There's more weight in levels of irony , not always the uproarious variety but more nuanced and violent , more in putting some good twists to the clichés that are taken for granted in stories set in desolate futuristic environments ( the discovery of a cute abandoned child , the devilish nature of the ' screamers ' themselves and how their more advanced counterparts work , the personalities of the crew that Peter Weller's character discovers at the base , and how each member soon dies / gets killed off ) . This might also be attributable to O'Bannon , who tackled this in his previous successes in films , but to say who is totally responsible for what can only be said for those who've read Dick's story Second Variety , which I have not . However it should be said , if only on some level of understanding from reading past works of his , it feels like it has a level of faith to the source , albeit changing locations and certain details in the situations , by being approximately cynical to the characters . The only problem then comes in with it being directed , more or less , as a standard slightly-higher-in-quality made for TV movie . It's by no means a sci-fi channel movie of the week , however Screamers might have fared a little better with its challenging and darkly funny bits without director Christian Duguay , who is professional enough to make it watchable on such a low budget ( low for how it looks anyway ) , but doesn't give certain scenes enough juice to really fly past where it stays at being average . The cast too is a little more of the regular variety , with isn't totally a bad thing ; by having character actors , B-level character actors ( if that ) , it helps add to the levels of slight subversion in this story they're in about technology gone to the dogs on a snow planet in 2078 . I liked seeing actors cast to type , like Andrew Lauer as the ' kid ' who's got enough experience as a soldier but is still pretty naive in other ways ; Roy Dupis in a sublimely duplicitous role ; Jennifer Rubin as the token tough girl . Even Weller has his right place in the framework , not too cocky a hero but with enough confidence to carry a picture without the Robocop gear . I even enjoyed some of the action set-pieces , with one especially involving a whole field of Davids ( the little robot boy ) . There's also a slight issue that has to be contended which is too many ' gotcha ' addendums to the climax . It's not enough that one character suddenly appears as another cyborg , but that there's another , and then another . . . and then finally one last wink in the final shot ( which actually does work as a creepy last bit ) , and it's detracting from what is attempting to be a little more substantial . It's only when the hints of things not staying all happy-in-the-end do the director and actors really hit good ground . Screamers has more than its share of moments , and it will continue to be an underrated find by sci-fi fans as the years go by . That it's nowhere near the best of Dick's adaptations - and not the worst - is understandable .
510704	453068	166843	6.0	I can't really recommend it , but I was engaged enough in it as a die-hard Romero fan	Oh the days when independent films were made and sometimes barely ever seen . That still happens to this day , but at least now there's DVD ( matter of fact that was the only way I could get to see There's Always Vanilla - it's next to impossible to find on bootleg ) . In , George A . Romero and the Latent Image , his production company that previously established itself big-time with Night of the Living Dead , decided to go a more romantic / dramatic route , as there seemed to be a possible small market for it . Unfortunately , the scriptwriter , Rudy Ricci , was haphazard and scatter-shot with his contributions , and the script was never finished until the end of filming ( it came to the filmmakers scene by scene ) , so even though there are characters to get interested in as a ' character study ' , Chris Bradley and Lynn Harris ( Ray Lane and Judith Streiner respectively ) , sometimes the dialog and situations become contrived . The main thrust of the story comes from Lynn's relationship to Chris , as Chris is a sort of man-child , who comes into her life suddenly one day after abandoning an older women he may or may not have fathered a kid with , and somehow through his constant sarcasm and lackadaisical charm that gets her into bed . But Chris , as we soon finds out , uses the wit and charms and occasional obnoxious means of talk to mask insecurities . He doesn't work , and when the opportunity comes he backs out . It all leads up to his father relaying a ' meaning ' : there's always vanilla . It's not totally incomprehensible to see why Romero , on an interview featured on the DVD , is completely assured with his feelings that it was a low-point in his career where he tried to gain more experience as a filmmaker and fell flat on his face . There is that side to the picture that is unequivocally dated , and the lack of a better budget or a means to a better structure ( particularly an ending that feels complete or make sense ) is frustrating . But a filmmaker sometimes has to feel that way about certain films , as the experience making it becomes a personal struggle whereas other times it could become a personal triumph ( he still considers Day of the Dead a favorite , mostly for the experience making it ) . Ironically though it's his own skills as a director and editor and director of photography that rises the material to a level of watchability . It's no Cassavetes - as another reviewer noted - but he treats the material with a control that wavers between late 60s early 70s exploitation film-making ( of the period , of course , with some scenes with psychedelia bits and music and pot ) , and a more grounded tone for the actors to follow . And sometimes Romero's given by Ricci a compelling scene to shoot , like when Lynn has to deal with a certain ' problem ' she may need to take care of , but decides at the last moment to run away from it . Or , of course , when Romero cuts the scenes together , sometimes around Chris's confessions to the audience about his mistakes and own feelings at certain times , which pop in at a good rhythm . Or the way he doesn't putz around with montage - often a high-quality trademark in Romero films - even when dealing with schmaltzy scenes like the quasi courtship of Chris and Lynn in a park or on a boat ( I also really liked the one liners each character traded off on one another in the park - marking the shallowness of the period ) . And the actors do bring qualities of believability to scenes that somehow work almost in spite of the flaws in the material ; Laine is actually charming and affable , carrying over similar qualities from the next collaboration with Romero in Season of the Witch , and Streiner is even better here than she was in ' Living Dead ' , as a woman who has to contend with being the mature one in a relationship where a falsity to it rings true almost every day . By the time one sees those balloons fly out of the cardboard box to the cheesy singing ( and usually there is cheesy music here ) , it's clear that this isn't Romero's finest dip into a change of pace . But even in a miscalculation there are intriguing , humorous notes touched on , and that no matter what Romero can somehow be pragmatic with his material , and chooses experimental angles in an otherwise typical low-budget effort .

The more one thinks about the Machinist , the more it's irksome by the cluttered screenplay ( Scott Kosar , with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Amityville Horror remakes to his credit ) , which reveals no surprise , or much suspense , in the mental downfall of one-year insomniac Trevor Reznik ( mega-gaunt Christian Bale , even more-so than in the recent , more worthy cause Rescue Dawn ) as he keeps seeing a portly bald guy named Ivan who may or may not work at the factory he's a machinist at , and may or may not be dating a prostitute ( Jennifer Jason Leigh ) , AND who may or may not have taken a little boy Trevor sort of knows as hostage . By the time the obvious twist comes along - the kind that my girlfriend points out about a third of the way through the movie , aw-hell ! - there's a feeling of being cheated from the smug retread of better post-modern psycho-twister fables ( i . e . Fight Club ) . That Kosar does ' clever ' tricks like putting in Dostoyevsky hints , without ever making much light about why they're there , compounds some of the BS . It's a shame , too , because he sometimes gives these characters some believable dialog ( mostly with the machinists and in some of Reznik's talk ) , without trying to take into account a conceit that is used : an insomniac for a year is , practically , not possible , hence there has to be a catch at some point or another . It's almost like a battle that wages on the creative side of things between director Anderson's very good compositions and ( typical-for-this-stuff ) lighting , and the script . Meanwhile , Bale holds up , even if after the fact it's a wonder why he went to such extreme lengths for a character like this ( i . e . would losing 40 pounds be any different than the whole 60 ) . Bale remains totally captivating , immersing as always in service of the character like the most method m-fer since De Niro , though in the reverse here . Because it is such an extreme transformation - unlike the more gradual turn in Herzog's film - we're called attention to it at times , which is unnerving , and works to a much greater effect as a sign of his deterioration than that of the script providing the mental faculties . But Bale does his best to fill in some emotional blanks , and to his credit makes the Machinist at least a passable effort . That being said , it's hard for me to see myself watching this all the way through again .
509980	453068	396171	6.0	fantastic production design , usually spellbinding editing . . . but the results are frustratingly uneven	I'll say it off the bat - I haven't read the book of Perfume by Patrick Suskind . But I have heard that the film is , ironic considering most directors ' claims that it was unfilmable , quite faithful to the source . I don't doubt it , as it has a literary quality all about it . From the John Hurt narration ( and even when it's not necessary or adding only bits to the psychology of the characters , it's good to have Hurt doing it ) , to the fast-paced storytelling , to the detail likely expressed in the locations and settings , it feels novelistic even when it's at it's worst ( which is , regrettably , the last twenty minutes , as Truffaut said is the most important section of a picture ) . The initial story itself , the first half of it , does spell some entertainment to come . An orphan grows up into a slave , but has somehow had since birth the incredible gift of smell , to smell everything ( yes , even in smelly old France ) , and is tempted more than ever after accidentally killing a woman one night and smelling her from head to toe . The idea of catching smell , scents of people , drives him bonkers as he later learns of perfume from a master ( Dustin Hoffman , one of the bright spots acting-wise ) that there have to be a set number of ingredients - and that special something to put it over the top . And over the top it does become ! But not before Tom ( Run Lola Run ) Twyker , cinematographer Frank Griebe ( also Run Lola Run ) , production designer Uli Hanisch , and ( surprisingly , considering his past work was with Paul W Anderson ) editor Alexander Berner create the look of the film as something worth watching for . In fact , for the latter , it sometimes is really absorbing the way the images move forward , at a clip that is a little reminiscent of Thelma Schoonmaker ( and , perhaps through that , Scorsese to a very small point ) . If looking squarely on the technical grounds , Perfume is one of the best produced out of Europe in 2006 . Yet however much Twyker and his crew - save for the music which is a befuddling mix of Popol Vuh and orchestrations for a Disney channel movie - go to lengths to make this feel real and gritty and dark , it's hard to obscure how there is , in a way , a silliness to the conceit of the character . On the one hand it is compelling to see him in his early stages , his first victim , his ' training ' ( in quotes as he doesn't need it exactly , just a little guidance ) . On the other hand , and a little more ironic considering the draw of the suspense and horror of the murders , when he starts killing it's not quite as compelling . I know there's a level of disbelief to be had , and this goes without saying that every time Jean Grenouille leaves someone ( orphan caretaker , slave owner , Hoffman's character ) that person dies . And even up until the last twenty minutes I could take that level of disbelief , and it's still a good movie . But when it comes to the climax - and Grenouille's " demise " ( from a point of view may depend on how much you take it as Christian allegory , or devil-allegory , who knows ) - it falls apart for me . It may not for some , as it's own pretentiousness might be part of the appeal - frankly there's a touch of the Passion of the Christ in the mix there as far as slow-motion melodrama goes - and some might hate it to no end . It's a flawed conclusion , though mostly cause of what has been set up before , while sometimes in the ridiculous ( so many murdered , none seen in the act , eh why not ) , feels and comes off realistic in that gritty 18th century set-up that can only come out of the poor and rich sections of French life . By the time we get the messianic image towards the end , I felt like turning off the movie - and luckily it ended . So Perfume ends up being neither a debacle nor a full-blown artistic success . I was glad to see it , and it's fairly well acted ( watch Alan Rickman as he speaks in a very low , sinister tone to Grenouille as he is dunked in the barrel of water ) , even to a point by the hollow-eyed Ben Whishaw . But it just , well . . . does not smell quite right at the end .
508870	453068	87995	7.0	the damnedest cult-movie ; uneven but rocking with attitude , humor and individuality	Alex Cox probably knew what he was doing with Repo Man , but it was probably something he concocted while in the basement of a young punk rocker with a lot of dirty second-rate comic books and a lot of booze . How it comes out on the screen makes it a kind of bizarre outcast in the realm of science-fiction comedies , because it's not entirely a comedy ( there's some moments that feel like they SHOULD be more dramatic , like the dynamic between Harry Dean Stanton and Emilio Estevez for the most part , or the scenes with secret-service-type alien chasers ) . In fact science fiction seems to be looming over the heads of everyone like it's some sort of half-goofy half-conspiratorial quagmire , all leading up to a Chevy Malibu that has a certain ' quality ' about it . Much of the story's tangents don't even seem to make too much sense , and the structure feels like it's been put together in cheap ( hence the comic-books ) . But Cox is always working with a mind-set for what's unexpected with absurdities and , oddly enough for such a punk-rock movie , quirkiness . Estevez plays Otto , a perennial punk-rocker who has a ' f you ' attitude to practically all authority figures , which keeps him usually unemployed . Enter in Stanton with his job as a repo-man , with cars getting taken away by " dildoes who don't follow the rules " , and so he joins up as he's got no prospects at all . As he learns how to go about getting car after car , a suspicious wormy guy in glasses is driving around a peculiar car that has a trunk that's similar to something out of the Ark of the Covenant , only more alien-like . So then , as Cox's rude and crude attitude goes , we get the secret-service guys , the bizarre punks who are all about causing disorganized chaos and robberies , ill-tempered Hispanics , a far-out guy at the repo place named Miller , and meanwhile there's always wackiness around the corner . The characters are more or less the main thing Cox works with here , as almost everyone here is an eccentric , or an oddball , or a total off-his-rocker loon ( or just , you know , with their ' secrets ' ) . And Otto himself is a prototype of the typical 80s kid , with no respect but not necessarily stupid either . And around these characters a lot of crazy things go on , or lines of dialog , and they either work or they don't . The only problem is that Cox isn't always focused with everything from scene to scene , and there's a mid-section that just comes off even too weird for me . But I didn't mind this for the most part ; there's almost a sense in the narrative that it's supposed to be sloppy and mismanaged , and through this there's more inventive qualities than one might find in a more prestigious flick with more money . Add on to this one of the great 80s soundtracks , and an ending that gives a big laugh with a big raised-eyebrow , Repo Man is a shaggy dog story , a rebellious-youth pic , and an urban take on the old tale of aliens coming to Earth ( for what reason I still can't tell ) . A minor work of ingenuity that is understandably with its cult audience .
508733	453068	43879	7.0	more melodrama than film-noir , but it does have some excellent stuff in it	I would be inclined more to give On Dangerous Ground a higher rating , or just think of it as a great film , even as I find there are certain things in the second half that doesn't quite click as well as in other parts . Two pieces of brilliance go by way of co-writer / director Nicholas Ray , however - casting Robert Ryan as the stoic-faced Jim Wilson , and getting Bernard Herrmann for the musical compositions . Ryan here has a great performance almost by not doing anything spectacular , by just having this very hard-boiled look to him in the early scenes in the urban , film-noir landscapes , and then as it very subtly peels away as he gets a touch of the ' heart ' he's been lacking back home . As the sort of masculine-centered core of the film , Ryan is quite good . Herrmann's score , meanwhile , in what he referred to as his favorite of his many many scores , delivers up emotion through the strings in the dramatic bits and the tougher stuff when need be . He , too , is on top of his game here . What's interesting about what didn't quite work , at least for myself , in On Dangerous Ground was a little more in due to the screenplay and to the performance from Ida Lupino . For a director who often has a script as one of the best parts of what he's doing , the writing here starts off fantastically in the city , then as it goes further on in the snowy , rural setting , the melodrama-side starts to loose some of its shape . It's not that the more rough , gritty style of the first part of the film doesn't correspond well enough with the later scenes ; in fact some of these chase scenes and shots of Ryan going through the snow after his ' suspect ' are well done from Ray's end . But part of the acceptance of the change that occurs in the character of Jim Wilson has to be as believable as Lupuno's performance can allow , and she is good in her blind - girl - who's - totally - compassionate up to a point . For example , I did get a lot of emotional contact when Ray shot her in close-ups . But overall there just seemed to be some spots in not just her portrayal of the material , but also in the performance of her character's brother ( not right in the head , perhaps , but is his work interesting , not really ) . I would definitely recommend On Dangerous Ground for the crowd of film-noir lovers , and those getting into Nicholas Ray's work ( as this will finally be on DVD soon enough ) . Yet if certain parts of the story's fabric and sentimentality might not click as well as it should to you , you're not alone . At the least , there's a heap-load of entertainment to be had with the scenes following the cops on their nights across the city streets , like a superlative short film amid a tragic tale of losing and finding yourself .
509337	453068	70608	7.0	it's less than great , but I liked watching it as a kid	I wouldn't recommend the Disney animated 70s movie of Robin Hood as essential Disney , but I have some great memories of it as a kid anyway . If there's any one thing I could probably criticize it's the song numbers - they just don't work and lack the fine polish of the Sherman brothers collaborations . Looking back on it it's very dated in that respect , sort of serving to the kids of the moment in part , and even to the point of reusing actual dancing bits from the Jungle Book ( if you've seen these movies as much as I have you start to notice these things ) . And as far as energy goes it's sometimes pretty lackadaisical . This being said , I also found a lot of it to be very funny , with the interplay between Peter Ustinov and Terry Thomas is fantastically good - they're such laughable villains , yet when they do strike their irons down it goes pretty dangerously . Of course you wont find anything at all in way of getting at all into the character underneath their basic demeanors - Robin Hood and those on his side , good , Prince John and those on his side , bad . But within those boundaries there is entertaining stuff going around , with the first robbing of Prince John through the very cheap disguise Robin puts on one , and another when Little John disguises himself as a Duke . Again , nothing immediately noteworthy , but as a kid I found a lot to go on it , with the more cartoonish aspects of the villains and side character outweighing the weaker sections of music and song , stale Robin and Mariam parts , and so on .
510413	453068	810895	7.0	not quite as sweet as the movie , but pretty darn close - should definitely appease fans of the comic book	Hellboy : Sword of Storms is in the quality of animation no more or less the standard one might see on the average program on Adult Swim ( Cartoon Network , of course ) . Which means it's always eye-catching , if only on a kind of wacky 2-D level that is left in the dust in these days of cinema going the way of CGI . What makes Sword of Storms significant , if only in parts , is that Mignola , Del-Toro and company start to introduce a lot more surreal imagery than was seen in the first theatrical feature . Hellboy gets swept up this time in a pretty convoluted ( or just seems that way , turns out it's actually painfully simplistic in terms of the Japanese folklore played out as drama ) , with monsters and demons all under the control of a sword that if broken spells doom for the Earth . As usual he does his job well at whacking around creatures like a big turtle / lizard creature , and at the start even tackles a big beast that , until Liz - as kind of a running un-funny gag - blazes fire all over the place till the job's done - but that's not all . This time the supernatural is accentuated in the world of what is a cross between Noh theater and , well , the average Hellboy comic-book . It doesn't matter either way how much the writers and producers researched Japanese history and creatures and such ( though I'm sure they did their share ) . What matters is how effective it all is , and in the end Hellboy is also a dark comedy - how is it to see Hellboy , after spending an uncomfortable night with some unpleasant Japanese fellows , to awake to find that they're heads have been disconnected from their bodies , and are attacking him viciously ! It's even better , of course , to see the fate of the heads , pleading Hellboy to tell where their bodies lay . I also liked the little asides with the talking fox , the old lady , and of course the big-ass demons , who allow one or two quips from Hellboy as he has to tackle them any way possible . On top of the fighting heads , there's a crazy possessed researcher , which in and of itself could make an interesting issue in the comics . Only the conventions of the story ( the psychic has been seen in countless permutations of the annoying side character who's only there for moments of sudden exposition for another side character who isn't as annoying ; plus the ending with the Japanese ghosts going through a redemption moment ) drag the film really downward . Aside from that , it's from cartoony viewing , and it should appeal to anyone who's somewhat a fan , and mandatory for fans of the books ; lord knows there's only so many times we can see Hellboy in the whirlwind of samurai dreams .
510434	453068	118111	7.0	my least favorite of the recent Guest / Levy collaborations , which means it's still funny , sometimes ingenious	Waiting for Guffman wasn't the first Christopher Guest / Eugene Levy collaboration ( as writers I mean , it's a Guest movie all the way ) I had seen , but I think I probably would've reacted to it as I did after having seen it after Best in Show and A Mighty Wind . It's like Guest and his always inspired troupe were with a full burst of energy with their characters , even if they're all in a movie that's a little too short ( it says 84 minutes but it feels even brisker if that's possible ) and provides some characters who are funny all the time ( like Guest's flamboyantly flamboyant Corky or Levy's nerdy and ostensibly Jewish Allan Pearl or Fred Willard as Rob Albertson ) , and some who are funny only in spurts like Catherine O'Hara or Bob Balaban . It's got quirky written all over the place , but it's always endearing in it's very strange way to show these people as they are , and the characters are likable even at their most deranged and just , well , ' small-town ' . Guest plays the director of a small-town's 150th anniversary memorial play , about how a town in Missouri came to be . It's a chance really to get glimpses into the people who get the chance of a lifetime ( err , for seemingly their mundane lifetimes ) , and especially for Corky who gives prima-donna an odd name ; he almost storms off when he doesn't get the money he asks the committee for ( calling them ' bastards ' in an angry burst that's one of the funniest things I've ever seen from Guest in anything he's done ) . Then comes crunch-time for the show , as Corky has to take a part himself and Alan Pearl has to convincingly play a part he has absolutely no confidence at ( those glasses ! ) . And all the while , the ' Guffman ' of the title - ala Godot - is a near God-like figure who could make or break the perception of the production for Corky and his cast . The final revelation from this is a comic classic touch . This all being said , I didn't really get the great big belly laughs and get as sucked into the world of these oddballs ( and all done in improvisational form no less ) as I did with the other films that have the mark of Guest and / or Levy . There are some parts where I'll smile at the near whimsy of what's going on , but a line might go flat or a bit a little weak . But if it's ever on TV , I'm sure I would tune in again just for a little while , if only to see a few of the songs from the 150th anniversary show ( the ' Mars ' song a favorite ) , and for that great epilogue .
510101	453068	470765	7.0	not as funny or enormously successful as past outings , but still worth seeing with well-earned laughs	If there's any one big problem in regards to For Your Consideration , the latest rip on a particular section of society by writer / director Christopher Guest and co-writer Eugene Levy , is that the targets aren't inherently wacky already . Don't get me wrong though , when I get the sense of what's going on in Hollywood , through the vanity and the hype and the reflection via the media , it's rather sickening , and it's never an unnecessary feat of comedic strength to try and skewer the whole society the filmmakers probably have to dwell in too ( keep in mind Michael McKean was up for an Oscar for Mighty Wind a couple years ago with Levy and Catherine O'Hara performing a song live ) . But this time it comes close to shooting fish in a barrel , so the writers , and the usual terrific ensemble performing the characters , have to go to even further eccentric lengths ( and in its own way logically so ) . It certainly doesn't backfire , but if it doesn't deliver for you as for me , don't be too surprised . Not to say it's not worth seeing once , far from it . In fact its probably got more than a few lines that might work better on repeat viewings . What's sharp is really still sharp and just odd as ever . The main thrust of the plot is around the making of " Home for Purim " ( the title alone makes me smile , at first heard I laughed hard ) , later turned to " Home for Thanksgiving " due to the studios interest / insistence on the project . Among the people involved are the director , played by Guest himself , who sometimes directs a scene with a pastrami sandwich in hand ; O'Hara , a self-conscious professional who becomes much more the former when she finds out a rumor of Oscar buzz ; Shearer as Victor Allan Miller , a stage pro who is possibly going to have to turn to commercials via his insistent agent ( Levy ) if this doesn't go too big ; Calie Webb ( Parker Posey ) , a young professional comedienne-turned-serious actress is also set afire by the ' buzz ' ; and Corey Taft ( John Michael Higgins ) , an agent or other sort like that who has to always bring up his Native American background . There's laughs that come and go with the characters , some more than others ( Ed Begley Jr , who was uproarious as the Swedish Jewish guy in Mighty Wind , is still great here as a make-up artist ) , but probably none more consistently and hilariously from Fred Willard . Just what his hair looks like or what get-up he has on as his character idiotically hosts one of those Acess Hollywood style shows , is funny ( especially the hair , which Willard of course never notices ) , and he helps elevate some moments to great heights . But there are other brilliant bits too , like when the writers of Home for Purim ( Michael McKean in full beard and Bob Balaban ) go on a Charlie Rose-type show , only where the question is overloaded for a whole minute with detail that gets them lost in what he was asking them . Or for the last chunk of the film , where through the awards buzz the sensitive Marilyn Hack ( O'Hara ) gets a botox injection and boob-job , which incites so much great comedic moments . Though what's interesting is how at times some of the comedy works best because its more natural , and other times more based on the performers . It's not the first time Guest has directed a non-mockumentary movie ( and though I've yet to see his obscure 80s film the Big Picture , it's miles ahead of Almost Heroes to be certain ) , but what's lost has to be made up through better construction of scenes . The improvisational feel is still there , but curiously an actor who usually is most dependable - Levy - is actually not as good in comparison with some of his co-stars . In terms of the comedy being natural though , it came out really best during the actually Home for Purim scenes being filmed , where Jewishness met with a kind of Bette Davis kind of film in the South . While a good deal of it , actually a lot more in comparison to the past Guest films ( even with the heap of it in Might Wind ) , is based on probably ' getting ' a lot of the Jewish jokes , the whole sense of spoofing a style of film is probably much more richer in satire than the actual behind-the-scenes moments they show . Though not to forget , it's always a killer seeing Harry Shearer in a hot-dog costume . From the way I described some of this , it sounds like a mixed review , but it isn't . For Your Consideration is a good , biting stab at an industry that takes itself way too seriously and trades in art for commercialism and the hype of an awards show . Maybe too , like with the most recent mockumentaries , it might get funnier on repeat viewings .
508154	453068	64694	7.0	on the failure of the hippies . . . featuring Pink Floyd !	I would be interested to hear from the director , Barbet Schroeder , as to why he decided to make More his first film , and more specifically what his interest in hippies - or rather this form of the Euro-hippie paradise - and about their demise . The film is , at least , true enough to keep one interested , but in its own kind of truth it's strange , biased . It's a given heroin ( aka , " Horse " ) is awful stuff , rotten , the conclusion for many a dumb-headed drug user that sees that as the be-all-end-all , because it basically is : after that everything else stops , that becomes the life , and it's either a continuous run for more of the same or death . More starts off as something concerning a romance between a New York girl and a German man , but it becomes something else , for better or worse ( sometimes both in the same scene ) . It's basically about two " young " people , Estelle and Stefan , who meet in a city where Stefan has come as a sort of wanderer away from his home country . She's wandering too , sort of , and is maybe too friendly with a big-time pusher named Wolf . They end up on a remote island somewhere nearby and , after a somewhat daring grab for some " horse " by Estelle , they also find a pad in the form of a seemingly remoter house along the seashore . Schroeder's comment on youth and sex and drugs isn't too simplistic , which makes the film actually lucid and intelligent so many years later . It's both direct and subtle , more about the characters and then about the fact that what he's depicting could in other hands just be a propagandistic hippie-exploitation picture . Perhaps most pleasantly , and this is just a guess , Schroeder uses as inspiration the sort of long sequence from Bergman's Summer with Monika : two kids in an inexorable connection , some good some definitely not so good , set against ( too ? ) perfectly shot landscapes . On the one hand , I should mention that there are problems , some big ones in fact . The performances aren't very convincing throughout ; a few scenes strike some power or have the actors in a good connection with one another , but Klaus Grumberg overplays himself even if he is an ornery German by nature ( in that case I would've preferred Klaus Kinski in the part to make it crazier but deep enough for the subject matter ) as does Farmer to her own degree . And there's gaps of naiveté in the screenplay that keep it from being as deep as it really thinks it is . On the other hand , there are two big things going for it : Nestor Almendros , the great cinematographer ( i . e . Days of Heaven ) is DP and is a big boost for a first time director like Schroeder . Nearly every image is seen with an awesome purpose or artistry , be it a shot of the cliffs by the sea or sun or something as simple as the seemingly natural light of a room . The other thing is Pink Floyd , probably the main reason I and many others have heard of the film in the first place ( years before I knew really who Schroeder was I saw the " More " soundtrack whenever I looked up Pink Floyd albums ) . It's very good music throughout , occasionally the mind-blowing variety that gives them the reputation they deserve . Some of it , too , is a little tedious , even as it is a movie that concerns free love and lots of drugs and sometimes both at the same time . I wouldn't rank it anywhere near as high as a Meddle or Animals , certainly not Dark Side , but it too helps to elevate the subject matter another notch , particularly when one least expects it or in low tones or floating in and out of buildings as Stefan or other walks on the streets . It's almost better atmosphere than the movie itself deserves , but overall More is still worth watching as a period piece - dated , but potent , like a less ambitious but more substantial Zabriskie Point .
509546	453068	768212	7.0	imaginative entertainment with some trippy images and a very good , ET-style heart	The Last Mimzy doesn't pander needlessly to its core audience , but at the same time it also has a good accomplishment in that it also has an appeal to adults , or at least those that have passed that age of adolescence and look back on childhood with levels of nostalgia and relief that it's over . It delights as well as gives special meaning to putting a level of belief in what is unknown at a time when the rest of the world relies on hard facts and rigid control of personality . It also puts ET to a certain test : can the little creature from another world that needs to get home kind of story hold up to quasi ( actually precise ) psychedelia ? Pink Floyd shirts and Roger Waters aside , this may even have a secret appeal to stoners just as much as your little boy or girl at the movie theater , who will obviously see it in a different life , that of light , efficient irreverence and lots of neat special effects . ' Mimzy ' tells the story of a boy and a girl , Noah and Emma , both at least under the age of 10 but old enough to be articulate enough as well as appropriately secretive in the fantasy they hold paramount , who come upon a strange rock from the ocean . In it lies a bunch of fragments , and , oddly enough , a stuffed , fluffy , cute bunny named Mimzy , who Emma takes as her most important possession . Noah meanwhile becomes transfixed with the new powers that soon come to him via these rocks : he can hear the smallest insect , and is transfixed by obscure designs . This strikes up the attention of his parents as well as his science teacher ( Rainn Wilson ) , who also knows of the symbols Noah makes up . But after a power outage - it also happens to be a generator that Noah conjures - gets the attention of the government , not sure what exactly is going on . Emma has a problem , however , in that Mimzy , her closest confidant and " teacher " is dying and needs to get back home . That's the basic story , anyway , as there are little ins and outs as the story goes on , including a great product placement for Sprite , and a montage-free example of each child's new abilities . Some of this may be a little preposterous , even goofy , but Bob Shaye and his team bypass the obvious but still perilous pit-falls for filmmakers investing themselves into children's movies . No truly stupid gags , nothing with bodily excretions , none of that really , and if anything the humor , of a little wild and over-the-top in variety ( some of which I was laughing at alone while the other kids were silent ) , is innocent and sort of knowing of the split of imagination between children and adults . The two kids are also very good at playing their parts , with Wryn as Emma very adept at being vulnerable and smart , and O'Neil being almost too close to looking like the boy Elliot in ET , however not without his own strengths . Shaye sometimes lets his control slip in just simple things like cinematography or making a fitting enough ending ( too many futuristic hippies me thinks ) , and the goofiness does teeter on becoming a little too much . But I responded more to how the power of taking a long repeated idea , of kids becoming changed by outside forces in a very real world , and there being a sort of little twist to it all . It's not just about making friends and gaining in some alien intelligence , but in figuring the significance of the future , however weird it might be . It's definitely the finest children's movie , non-animated , to come out so far in 2007 .
508271	453068	492506	7.0	a delight for linguists and fans of words , not bad for everyone else	Crossword puzzles , and the many people who make them popular , are the focus in Wordplay , including the editor of the NY Times puzzle ( the most notorious of them in the USA ) , celebrities and politicians , and the general public obsessed with them . As a documentary Wordplay is good , not great , film-making about its subject with a couple of montages and interlocking scenes that are weak . But the subject matter , and usually how its presented , sparks a fine interest even in a non-crossword puzzle player like myself . As words are all that we have to work with in communication and just everyday discourse , it's also attached here to the idea of testing , of competition , and how different and varying crosswords can get . Like the documentary Spellbound from a few years back , the director is also after the kind of irony of making such an isolated experience of finishing a puzzle into an event with hundreds of players once a year with friendships and acquaintances - a social event as much as a match-up . Many parts are amusing as well ; we get interviews from Jon Stewart , Bill Clinton , Bob Dole , and the editor of NY Times Crossword himself , Will Shortz , and they all give some insightful , funny little bits of interest into making the puzzles and playing them . But for the most part we're into the mind-set of several key players , real people whom will all come together for the tournament in Jaunary . What makes all of this work , and what actually makes crossword puzzles become good enough for cinema , is watching smart people , un-cluttered for the most part with problems , who can focus all of their attentions on this one activity , to the point of obsessive compulsive behavior . It's really fun , in a nerdy way , trying to guess some of these words ( or rather watching them guessing the words ) along with the players . And the way the puzzles are created sparks a little interest too , as it's one of those parts of life I myself could never , ever accomplish . Worth a look , though probably more so for fans of the activity .
509493	453068	473107	7.0	gives a good , cliff-notes analysis of the many facets of Wal-Mart	Wal-Mart : The High Cost of Low Price , is a somewhat valiant attempt by Robert Greenwald to put into a coherent picture what it is that makes Wal-Mart such an overbearing presence as a conglomeration and ultimate capitalist ( or maybe more likely fascist ) entity . It goes something like this : the independent businesses that serve at the pleasure of small towns can't keep up with the competition that a HUGE Wal-Mart imposes and closes down ; the same towns , in the subsidizing that goes on , end up losing out on what makes a town a town , and it even encroaches into education ( schools shut down ) ; the employees work for crap wages , get no real medical insurance or health-care , and there is discrimination as well as no real care for what the wages should be as opposed to cheating the workers of overtime pay ; the international impact , workers in factories in China and Wal-Mart employees in Germany ; and finally the impact of the consumer's safety within security camera sight in the parking lots . In shot , Greenwald's expose is meant to be a bitter , bi-partisan pill to swallow ( albeit some conservatives , of course , will look at what Wal-Mart represents , as did the Republican National Convention which invited the CEO to speak ) for anyone interested in what may be dangerous about something as immense a profit-machine as Wal-Mart . Through all of this , Greenwald gets usually impassioned testimonies from past workers , small-town farmers and store owners that had to close up and look elsewhere for money , and even those who succeeded in stopping Wal-Mart coming into town . His stylistic tactics might be a little less gripping as the people he gets on camera ; his editing taste is pretty simplistic as a documentary filmmaker , and unlike other documentaries he's made his taste in music choices are a little emotionally over-bearing or too manipulative for the moment meant to be caught . There is also something that is sort of lacking in the documentary which is a more incisive look at why the consumer gives Wal-Mart so much business . Is it truly the low prices ? I think it's something a little more complex , and it is maybe wisely kept to a subtle level given how much Greeenwald gets in 97 minutes : there is a comfort factor , something almost meant to condition the consumer , with a Wal-Mart . Who needs to go to this place and that place and the other in a town to get everything done , when a Wal-Mart has everything needed , from groceries to auto work and hardware ? It's a level of complacency that isn't always totally comforting , however , as those who've been victims of crimes in the parking lots would say ( and just in 2005 alone ) , or those in other countries who work slave wages for said comforts at home . Bottom-line , this Wal-Mart documentary doesn't present many things that most informed about what the corporation is all about won't already know ( certain things , like the subsidizing and its full effects , or the environmental damage , are fresh and appropriately critical ) , but it does act as a meaningful portrait of the truths that the ads would never live up to , and if anything contradicts everything in a typical Wal-Mart ad . What it lacks in anything striking visually it compensates with its relatable human drama on the levels that should matter to Wal-Mart , but never will .
509673	453068	109592	7.0	has awesome moments of horror and bizarre humor , the rest of it . . .	Cemetery Man is the kind of horror flick I know I SHOULD like a lot more than I do . It certainly is clever with a premise that doesn't give a whole lot to think of will happen : a ' cemetery man ' Francesco ( Rupert Everett , a surprise casting choice but one that works ) and his assistant Gnaghi ( played by a very strange actor François Hadji-Lazaro ) , shoot the dead as they arise from the graves . They're not quite zombies , per-say , in that they don't eat flesh and turn those that have been eaten into zombies ( well , actually , they do bite , but you don't get infected apparently ) . It's almost a ho-hum kind of deal , as the dead come crawling and walking into Francesco's home , and without batting an eyelash he shoots them in the head . This is , until , he meets a woman who does the whole ' turns his life upside down ' trick , and after sleeping with him a grave , and getting bitten , and thought by him to be dead and then shot , though not dead , he goes into inner turmoil . There's a lot more things that happen here , and some of it rather strange and delirious ( perhaps my favorite bit is with the fat assistant growing attached to a young girl's un-dead severed head , which he keeps in a television until her father - the mayor - hears her and gets subsequently attacked by her ) . But here and there it's almost kind of . . . dull , that is until you can feel yourself saying " oh , this is getting even weirder now than before , if that's possible . " I'll give the director points for that , for keeping some of the bizarre humor going along , such as Francesco's freak-out at the hospital ( not very outlandish , more like a simple shots fired at one or the other while demanding to know why some guy copycatted his crimes ) . And sometimes he even rises to the crazy operatic levels of horror that his contemporaries of the 70s and 80s had going on . But at the same time , knowing that a good deal of the movie is awesome and even original as it looks at a guy's psychological and moral disintegration ( to kill the living , as bad as killing the dead , hmm ) , it also doesn't make sense a good portion of the time , as a lot of Italian horror tends to lean towards . Particularly the ending , which I won't reveal aside from being very similar perhaps to the ending of the St . Elsewhere TV series , is a head scratcher and meant to get the audience talking long after the movie ends . While it's a lot of fun , and with a ( anti ) hero to root for , and with a sidekick that's truly an oddity , I'm not sure it's worth the kind of discussion many cult fans use to discuss the likes of Fight Club and Donnie Darko . It's not very complicated , it just thinks it is .
509880	453068	425661	7.0	" ah ah , Azuki beans , I love them "	What a strangely wonderful , if sometimes slight and bulky , big-budget fantasy this is . Takashi Miike had already proved , by the time he got to The Great Yokhai War , that he could dip into other films aside from his supposed niche of the crime / yakuza genre ( Visitor Q and Andromedia showed this , the former great the latter lesser ) . But here Miike , in his first and only co-screen writing credit no less , proves that he can deliver the goods on a post-modern soup of mythical fantasy conventions , and with it boatload of CGI , creature-effects and make-up , and an epic battle that is more like a " festival " than something out of Lord of the Rings . The comparisons can be made far and wide , to be sure , and the most obvious to jump on would be Miyazaki , for the seemingly unique mixture of kids-as-big-heroes , power-hungry sorcerers looking for the energy of the earth as the main source , machinery as the greatest evil , and many bizarrely defined , flamboyantly designed creatures ( or Yokai of the title ) . But there can also be comparisons made to Star Wars , especially to the Gungan battle in TPM , and to the whole power-play between good and evil with similar forces . Or to anime like Samurai 7 . Or , of course , to Henson's films . And through all of these comparisons , and even through the flaws or over-reaching moments , it's Miike all the way with the sensibilities of effects and characters . Here , Ryunosuke Kamiki plays Tadashi , the prototypical kid who starts out sort of gullible and sensitive to things in the world , but will become the hero in a world going into darkness . The darkness is from an evil sorcerer , who gets his energy from all of the rage and wretched vibes in the human world , and who is also starting to put to death the spirits and other creatures , the Yokhai , into a fire that sends them into gigantic robots that have only one mission - to destroy and kill anything in their paths . Tadashi gets as pumped up to fight Sato the sorcerer as the Yokai once Sato's main minion and cohort , Agi ( Kill Bill's Chiaki Kuriyama , another great villainies ) steals Tadashi's little furry companion , a Sunekosuri . Soon , things come to a head , in a climax that brings to mind many other fantasy films and stories , but can only be contained , up to a point , by Miike and his crew . I would probably recommend The Great Yokai War for kids , but in the forward note that it's not some watered down fantasy in American circles . This has creatures galore , including a one-eyed umbrella stand , and a walking , talking wall , not to mention a turtle , a fire serpent , and a woman who became cursed by Sato . So the variety is on high on that end , and one might almost feel like the creatures and effects - which grows to unfathomable heights when the " festival " hits with the Yokai reaching hundreds of miles in scope . But there's also a sense of fantasy being strong in both the light and the dark , and Sunekosuri becomes perhaps the greatest emotional tool at Miike's disposal ( and not just because it's cuteness squared ) ; where else to get an audience riled up than over a little furry ball of fury , who ends up in a tragic battle with Tadashi in robot form ? Yet through all of this , the sense of anarchy that can be found in the brightest spots of Miike's career is here as well , which distinguishes it from its animated , Muppet and sci-fi counterparts . There's the bizarre humor as usual , including a song dedicated to Akuzi beans at a crucial moment in the climax , and more than a few flights of fancy with the creatures and fight scenes ( I loved , for example , the guy with the big blue head who has to make it smaller , or the anxious turtle-Yokai ) . The biggest danger with Miike's access to bigger special effects and computer wizardry , which he flirts with , is overkill on this end . He's got everything down , I'm sure , with storyboards , and he creates some memorable impressions with some compositions ( one of them is when all is said and done , and Tadashi and the ' other ' human character are in the middle of the Tokyo rubble in an overhead shot ) , but the CGI is sometimes a little unconvincing with the robots , and the interplay skirts on being TOO flamboyant , and some visuals , like the overlay of the Yokai spreading the word about the big festival on the map , just seem weak and pat . I almost wondered if Miike might dip into ( bad ) Spy Kids territory , quite frankly . But this liability aside , The Great Yokai War provides more than a share of excitement , goofy thrills , and innocent melodrama that came with many of the best childhood fantasies . It owes a lot to cinema , as well as traditional Japanese folklore , but the screws are always turning even in its most ludicrous and veeringly confusing beats . It's not the filmmaker at his very best , but working in experimentation in a commercial medium ends up working to his advantage . It's got a neat little message , and lots of cool adventure .
508622	453068	120838	7.0	not quite prime-cut Larry David material , but enjoyable all the same	Although it's been a long time since I've seen Sour Grapes , the experience of seeing it - preferably alongside another Seinfeld fan - was fairly pleasant , in that biting Larry David tone . This was the only time David wrote and directed a film , and it does show that he's trying to work through telling a total story within the framework of a feature all the way through . But somehow it's quite an entertaining piece of quietly ( or not so quietly ) deranged satire on envy , sexual frustration , and the condition of a principle of something . The premise is simple - two good friends go out to Las Vegas to gamble , one friend asks the other for a quarter for a slot machine , and via the quarter in the slot machine the guy wins a helluva lot of money . By the friend with the original quarter's estimation , a part of that change is his , but the friend now says that it isn't . A likely Seinfeld sub-plot is stretched out so that the ideas are given a little breathing room , even if one recognizes that , perhaps , it would be a masterpiece if it were simply a Seinfeld episode , or more appropriately a Curb Your Enthusiasm with even more acidic humor and total unease thrown at the situation . Around the premise , David also tosses in a supporting character who has one of his testicles removed - the wrong one by the doctor , who is one of the friends - and despite his now high voice ( ho-ho ) he seeks out some payback . That's one of the clearest big gags , as obvious as it is , is the moment when the ' testicle-man ' , as one might be tempted to describe him , is told by the doctor that the wrong one was taken out during surgery , to his immediate fainted response in a cut-away . On top of this , David experiments with some stupid sex humor ( not that there wasn't at least a little later on on CYE , eg Jeff's mother's ass at a stoplight ) , like with Bierko's character in the self-humiliation of not being able to , um , ' service ' himself in a certain way , under the stress of the tear in the friendship . As mentioned , none of this really makes for the kind of classic comedy one might expect , or crave , from maybe one of the only geniuses ( yeah , I said it ) working in comedy today . But as almost something of a fluke , it does its job well .
509332	453068	913958	7.0	mostly a ' fly-on-the-wall ' approach to the former President . . .	. . . but despite some of Jonathan Demme's techniques to making Man from Plains , which are either interesting ( the skewed camera on the television screens , the title cards listed in big font above the locations in some scenes ) or off-putting ( the usage of music is overbearing ) , his movie should be called the proverbial ' fair and balanced . ' There are few issues in the world that ignites the firestorm of debate like Israel and Palestine land and peace talks ( the abortion issue is right up there ) . Jimmy Carter placed himself into the pit of controversy a year and a half ago with his book " Palestine : Peace , Not Apartheid " , and director Demme does his best to reveal not simply Carter defending his points on various interview shows and programs , but to get the other side's voice as well . Carter isn't let off very easily , and rightfully so . But had Demme gone too far either way in depicting the reaction to the book , then the documentary would get damaged by the effect . This might make Man From Plains seem slightly ' safe ' , but its strongest points are just revealing , without pushing a whole lot of stylistic fervor in the way , this man in his complexity , conflicts , resolve , and in his comfortable position as about as well-respected a ex-President one could ask for . He has a lot to boast about with some of his past accomplishments ( some which we might forget as what he might have not done ) , but a lot of his output and speeches and very concise answers are based on experience . It's easy to pin down Carter as he's labeled - anti-Semitic , plagiarist - without either reading his book ( s ) or seeing what is really going on past the veneer of the media's depiction . Just seeing the interviewees ( with some exceptions ) repeating the named " apartheid " for incisive affect is enough to see what can be taken out of context . Does this mean that Man From Plains reveals everything that could be about Carter on this book tour with the amount of depth one might hope for with an ex-president ? Maybe not . But for what it's worth , Demme delivers two hours of potent coverage , and even creates a narrative around his detractors / protesters ( i . e . rabbis / Dershowitz / Brandeis ) that adds a little weight to what would otherwise be Demme's equivalent to Moore's the Big One . As a portrait and a compact look at a hot-button issue , it's very good if not mind-expanding .
509048	453068	82357	7.0	great on imagery , but some of the actual story is . . . lost on me	For sixteen minutes Czech animator and filmmaker Jan Svankmajer does his job well with getting a real terror and doom and gloom and deconstruction of the house of Usher , one of those quintessential spots of horror of Poe . In just watching the images go by and the stop-motion utilized in creative and unexpected ways involving the house and walls and pools of water and mud , it's amazing work . But the problem for me was in the actual translation of the story itself . Perhaps it's being only most familiar with English , so with the DVD subtitles going by at a quick clip that it's hard to keep up with keeping an eye on all of these dark visions put on the screen . That there's also a complete lack of any actors ( unless one counts a sole raven among the cast ) is also a deterrent since the story features all of these characters decomposing along with the damned house itself . It's an expressionist experiment , somewhat reminiscent of parts of Last Year at Marienbad , but it's only successful in part because of the director's dedication to the imagery . It's great pictures put to a so-so execution of " story " if there is much of one at all ; maybe I'll learn Czech one say and it'll appear better .
508259	453068	73778	8.0	Now I know why this is a Rolling Thunder re-release , , ,	Switchblade Sisters , apart of the more or less dozen films in Tarantino's Rolling Thunder pictures collection ( re-released exploitation flicks and foreign films ) , was worth the watch for a past midnight time of viewing . It might even be Jack Hill's most entertaining movie ( though I haven't seen Coffy in a while ) . There are really a few things that he gets really right , amid the obvious camp that comes with a movie like this . He uses some tough , interesting B-actresses for the parts of the Debs-turned-Jezebelles , with Robbie Lee and Joanne Nail and Monica Gayle as the main three ladies of the bunch all turning in cool , un-restrained performances ( one thing they don't lack , aside from some sex appeal , is spunk ) . Another thing that makes the film really work is that , more often than not ( which was also the case with Hill's Pam Grier pictures ) is that it's very , very funny . Sometimes it was just by some unexpected stuff ( the guy in the elevator early in the film , or stuff during the climactic battle in the streets ) , or just by some of the creative dialog . But really what helped make the film work for me was that it had a great marriage of ' exploitation ' ideals ( just look at the prison scenes ) with spots of realism , or at least things that seem realistic in the Roger Corman school of writing . These may be larger-than-life character , but that's part of the fun in it , that it's an action fantasy where we can root for the rough , take-no-prisoners gals of action , who also aren't completely in-human . Hill , who has mentioned in interviews how part of his film-making comes from being a musician , knows the rhythms of scenes and dialog ( as stupid as it can get at times ) , and even has a little style to show off amid the patently 70's times . That , in the end , it's really a lot of fun helps out during some of the more ' dramatic ' parts . And what an awesome last line !
509924	453068	443366	8.0	after seeing only a few episodes , I can't wait to see them all !	Nick Frost is in very fine form here , not nearly as sloth-like or just plain dumb ( though ingeniously so ) in Edgar Wright's comedies but still with a sense of the truly ridiculous in sublime style . His gags are obvious and repetitive ( which I loved , like when he's completely covered in the red protective gear and constantly hit by two guys with sticks ) , and sometimes with such tact and speed you can't see them coming ( eg when he's lost in the woods at night and an audio-tape meant as a bomb counts down while a voice speaks over it " find the bomb " ) . It's subtle in the best form of British comedy , but it's also akin to Frost going into situations that border on being not even too dangerous : will there be danger in ice-fishing ? Some of the biggest laughs even come from the little illustrations and cartoons shown of Frost showing what to do at , say , a volcano eruption , or if an elevator cable gets broken . Much of it is uproarious simply because no one will ever have to attempt , much less do , this in real life ( i . e . driving a car like James Bond , rescuing hostages , and mingling with reindeer while an elf goes to task getting his own ) . Some of the tips are actually possibly useful , if in the most truly absurd ways . How to deliver a baby in a taxi ? How to obtain water if you're in the middle of the desert ? What about possible attacks from Kommodo dragons , bears or gorillas ( watch for the sign language-off between Frost and a silver-back , priceless ) . While it isn't always all golden comedy - some bits like the reindeer one need to rely on too much absurdism to really stay afloat for too long - more often than not it's addictive stuff , especially if you've got the series on DVD . I could see recommending this to people who may not have even seen Frost's work in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz as his personality rings dead-on as being sincere in the questions and ruthless in shameless shtick ( few things can compare to seeing Frost get an explanation on how to deal with a nut with a baseball bat - one of 4 , 000 not used in the UK - in a bar brawl ) . None of his skewering of old tried-and-true dangers of the world is cruel or too stale , and there's originality in just approaching which guest interviewees to have . Witty and silly , once tapped into the wavelength Frost is reaching for , it's well worth the tutorials .
510781	453068	454848	8.0	goes a little long not knowing when to end , but it is a genuinely clever crowd pleaser	Inside Man has the appeal of a slick , cool , not-too-old used car . You know certain things will definitely be there , but you also are hoping some things might be surprising . Spike Lee isn't doing an incredible subversion of the heist picture , particularly the bank-heist picture , but he is putting his mark on it , and this split between common Hollywood stylistics and a personal vision make it a fine little piece of studio film-making . There's also a story at work here , one that does develop the ensemble ( mostly of hostages , and cops , and others ) , while also developing in a way that , at the least , isn't too boring . There may be a lot of elements going on in the film surrounding this bank robbery , and its questionable if the focus isn't on one thing the whole time . But if Lee can do one thing quite well , it's making sure the pieces fit , most of the time . His cast is all top-notch , with his on / off again acting collaborator Denzel Washington in his smart , always interesting form as the hostage negotiator . He's up against Clive Owen's Don , head of a few really well-planned ( he calls it the " perfect bank robbery " ) robbers , who've taken a heap of people hostage . Owen , to me , has one of his better performances , not an easy feat being under a mask and glasses through most of his role , but his voice ( as usual deep and brooding in his English way ) is dead-on and threatening . There's also Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer as the ' special interests ' looking out for something that happens to be in a certain safety deposit box . If I'm being a little vague then its for the purpose of the viewer ; this isn't a twist that just comes out of nowhere , and it could be argued to not even be a real ' twist ' . One of the things that had me really attentive was knowing how the structure of the story would go after a while , the bits of general unpredictability of when a flash-forward ( err , Denzel's interviews with the ex-hostages ) , and how it carried a similar lighting scheme to Lee's Clockers . It's a very good lighting set-up . And , like Scorsese with the Aviator , in this very prominent big-studio budget , Lee is able to put in little nods to the audience that this is still his ' joint ' . Even if the screenwriter , Russel Gurwitz , doesn't have the focus always together , and after the climax there are a few too many exposition-type scenes , the last scene does give a nice grin to most in the audience . In fact , this is a terrific film to see in a packed theater , as I had the chance to have , as there are more than a few really funny moments interspersed with the more thrilling cat & mouse scenes . Inside Man plays on clichés in a way that reminds me of the Usual Suspects , and done in its own slick , used-car way that wont really break down , for most .
509518	453068	100802	8.0	one of the most enjoyable of the Arnold action vehicles	Total Recall has little , if any , by way of passing itself as being ' art ' . It is , but more in the sense of it being pop-art , of the director Paul Verhoven paying tribute in visuals to the story by Phillip K . Dick . And it's also one of the more exciting and quotable of those shameless examples of how to do an action film . In this case , however , because it is a P . K . Dick-based story there are some good social bits made in the process . If it isn't as astute or consistent as Blade Runner or Minority Report , it's probably more due to it having to be a vehicle for Arnold Schwarzenegger than it being a full-on thought-provoking work of science fiction on film . But this does rank up high with the other works of the star , as he is in a complex situation in the film - his mind is scrambled , at first , and everything he thought was right as dickens is not . So he's told by ' himself ' on a screen he happened to save for himself that he has to get to mars to find out the truth . There is plenty of good action sequences , but it is more about Verhoven's knack at getting this popularized view of Mars just a little subverted , a little stranger . Some of my favorite scenes involved Scwarzenegger's mishaps and turns of fate as the story and his character took turns . For example , in the scene when Arnold's character wants to get his memory wiped off to Mars and then he flips out in the chair , this is a very entertaining scene in being very ridiculous ( try to listen to what he says , or don't as its near unintelligible ) as well as following a darker trek in the story . In fact , much of the film works on the strengths of both director and star by having it not too over the top to have some belief in what is going on , but that expectations aren't limited to what might happen as Arnold's character in on Mars uncovering the conspiracy around his messed-up memory . Featuring a sultry Sharon Stone in a great supporting role ( another memorable scene comes with her demise , as usual quotable to the bone ) , as well as a memorable climax involving the arid Mars air and a certain outrageous reaction to it , I recommend Total Recall for genre fans and even those who might be wary of it being a ' Hollywood ' take on Dick . It's not great , and per usual PKD fans might scoff at the faithfulness to the source , but it's better than some of the lesser adaptations of the author . Just go in for a good time and it stands up over time ( err , 16 years ) .
509997	453068	360845	8.0	Godard's first really good film in a while	I first saw Notre Musique at the NY film festival , and responded to it strongly because it was , after going through a slew of his more recent work of the 80s and 90s ( often hit or miss , more miss ) , a very well structured , interesting picture with a very distinct look and feel that balanced the elegiac and darkness with some light . Watching it again , I'm still fascinated most by the first segment ' Hell ' . If this was just a stand-alone short film , I would rank it among some of Godard's best work from the 60s . It's brash , it's seemingly unending , the narration actually does fit the images on screen ( which , from my perspective , is what ends up usually irking me with some of Godard's later work when he does this ) , and all of these images of civilization decaying through war and other disasters , and the machinery and technology used for all of this death and horror , really works to a great effect . Purgatory , the second segment , is often quite good , as it's a really well-balanced mix of fiction and documentary as real life writers and professors and journalists go through issues like Sarajevo , troubles in the middle east , and cinema itself as Godard humorously and sometimes somberly goes through a lecture to some students as he's part of the setting . There's even a perfectly understated , interested performance by the lead Sarah Adler . When the film then transforms into the last act , Paradise , it kind of starts to break some of the power and interest in the previous sections of the film ( I didn't really connect with much of the symbolism , as beautifully photographed as it all was ) . But what ends up really impressing me most about Notre Musique is that I really could understand most , if not all , of what many of these long stretches of dialog were about - unlike in some past , notoriously messy films by the director - and it worked without Godard's way of filming subjects and locations . Julien Hirsch's cinematography , going through the director's vision , is often so striking I'd say it's some of the best that was done in 2004 anywhere . There's still some kind of documentarian's spirit at heart , and it really does work best in the conversations that go on in the film , as lots of subject matter gets covered . This mixed with a partially fictionalized story helps to make something pretty special , if not really sensational , and in its 80 minute running time nothing overstays its welcome . If anything , the film is almost too short by a few minutes . It's a mix of history , politics , poetry , cinema , and the meanings of life and death , and not often does it come off pretentious .
507837	453068	206601	8.0	of most interest to Fellini fans ; casual viewers , per usual , will be baffled but amused I'd figure	The Director's Notebook , a very off-the-cuff , stream-of-consciousness documentary by Federico Fellini , reminds me of what Terry Gilliam said in his introduction on the 8 DVD , of which this is so generously included . He said that once he went and shot a film in Italy and more specifically in Rome , he guessed that perhaps Fellini was perhaps more of a documentarian of what he saw in Rome than he was making up incredibly outrageous and fantastical visions . This time we as the audience get about as close as that can be ( though Amarcord , and to an extent La Dolce Vita , come close too in their own ways ) to the Rome that Fellini sees as real . We may not , of course , but it is of course all part of subjectivity when going into many documentaries . This time , we get a view inside Fellini's film-making style , his actors , some memories and locations and shots and " lost " sets and footage , and the un-reality of it all just pours more truth to the gobbledy-gook that sometimes makes up the film . As with even the lesser Fellini moments , he doesn't leave fans totally without some fulfillment . It's something that is very much what Fellini would do , given what he wants to show the audience as his techniques and approaches . Right away we know this will and wont be your usual auto-bio into a director , as he gets some comments off some ' hippies ' who happen to be traipsing around the ruins of a film he planned to shoot ( or not , as case may be , I don't know ) . Then he and the American narrator go on between seeing things being shot - and the sets of which shot by Fellini himself with the usual peering and following and moving camera - on Satyricon . But it's not just that , to be sure , as it is basically a look through notes , ideas , and much of what might be considered almost conventional in the Fellini-esquire sense . But it's still entertaining through it all , and I loved seeing a partial re-creation and look at Fellini's inspiration from the " Old Rome " he knew through silent films as a kid . Or the moments with Mastroianni . A nice diddy , which is now no longer a lost scene but now restored , is the sack-man scene from Nights of Cabiria hosted by Masina herself . And all the while , in tricky English , Fellini leads us along in his very bigger-than-life though somehow modest way of talking to us as his audience , through Roman ruins , coliseums , actors in screen tests , scenes being shot , seeing some strange things ( one of which , maybe not as strange , is his own office ) , and other fragments that are very reminiscent of Fellini's comedies and tragedies . Nothing too revelatory , but just enough to keep Fellini fans salivating .
510100	453068	91939	8.0	a tale that takes a feminist critique of a situation , and gives it a male viewpoint too	I read one review on here that labeled She's Gotta Have it as Spike Lee's ' feminist view ' . I would agree with this in part because he doesn't show anything - the characters really - on any one side . We see her follies completely . But I think there is a male view going on with his look at these characters too ; after we see how a woman can be all liberated and free of being too restricted with who she wants to love / fool around with , there's more of a sympathy going on for the men too as the situation starts to come down to an essential thing - what does Nola REALLY want ? By the end of the picture , no one can really say for certain , Nola most of all , but all the while Lee has given us a look at romance that is ordinary only in how some of the typical characteristics of men and women are portrayed at times . But really , it's also out of the ordinary on showing the little things that wouldn't get into the common romantic comedy . It's a little too loosely structured and the style isn't altogether great , but it has as much ambition as Scorsese's Who's That Knocking or Bertolucci's Before the Revolution , at least in trying to convey subject matter primarily through style . Not to say the substance is left unchecked - in fact for the most part it's one of Lee's sharpest satires on the troubles of the sexes , and the main characters are a bit more believable than those of the main white / black couple of Jungle Fever . Lee boils it downs to seeming essentials at first - Nola ( Tracy Camilla Johns , not bad at all if not as strong as the main ' heroine ' could be ) is a magazine painter , but really its her romantic life that keeps her usually occupied . We see the various attempts of various male ' pick-up lines ' ( which is pretty hilarious , if dated ) , and then we meet guy # 1 , Jamie ( Tommy Hicks , maybe the best ' real ' actor of the group ) , who is really the nice guy , the kind that any reasonable woman would consider probably marrying sooner or later . But she also has male # 2 , Greer ( John Canada Turrell , with a great , shallow look to him if not overall performance ) , who is a male model who is meticulously egotistical even with folding up his clothes before sex . And then there's # 3 , Mars Blackmon ( Lee himself , in uproariously huge glasses and his name etched out in gold across his neck , surely one of his most wonderful characters played by him ) , who is the jokester , and word-spinner , and always takes a while to get around in a conversation . So around and around she goes , and it's really only until the last twenty minutes when Nola finally has to come down and make the decision - and it perhaps will have to come down to the ' right ' decision - but for what she just can't tell . Part of it is that she just loves sex , which becomes a problem when she invites over the three men for thanksgiving ( not a totally successful scene , mainly due to the dialog and pacing , but still a nice job in awkward tension ) . And also a problem when Jamie , the nice guy , makes an ultimatum for Nola . At the same time in the background there is the unusual tension of a possible lesbian affair with Opal ( Raye Dowell , very good in her scenes ) , but nothing comes to it . Scenes like those , where the sexual and relationship-type boundaries come into question , are really interesting . The self-conscious talking-to-the-camera interview bits range from excellent to just OK though , and sort of mark the quality of the film down a peg , even as the characters get to share some of their inner thoughts ( Lee's being the funniest ) . What then makes Lee's film a big step above any other number of films out there , primarily in the Hollywood mainstream , about a woman who has trouble deciding what to do with herself ? It's two things ; one , that the men are probably just as interesting with what they have going on as her , if not more so for Jamie , and two , the cinematic techniques imposed by Lee and cinematographer Ernest Dickerson . The latter of those two helps make She's Gotta Have it even more of a light-hearted picture than it might have been if just filmed as the script is . We get the images first put to Lee's father Bill's score , which is definitely one of his best after Do the Right Thing . Then the images get a lot of invention on such a small budget , unusually intimate and creative camera angles ( I loved the bit when we see in slow-motion the extreme close-ups of Mars getting close with Nola ) , the lighting often very expressionistic , and sometimes the editing going to playful , odd lengths like the sex scene between Nola and Greer . Sometimes the playfulness and first-time filmmaker amazement is a little much , like the color film sequence , which is beautiful but almost better self-contained than with the black & white grittiness of the rest of the film . I also could've done without the last bit after the denouement where all the actors say their names with the clapper . Nevertheless the stylistic merits add a lot to make it a richer film in context and structure . But if you can seek it out , especially in widescreen ( I saw it on IFC , though I wish I could see the director's cut to see what was cut out , however explicit it might be ) , it's well worth it . It's a small film , yet one that brings up some intriguing bits about what it means to really love someone vs . desire them , and what mind-games go on between men & women , men & men , women & women , and where the middle-ground could be , if at all . A minor independent / debut classic .
510681	453068	47444	8.0	a good start to a handsomely done , ' old-school ' epic trilogy	I watched the first part of the Musashi Miyamoto trilogy , dubbed simply Samurai 1 on the video , thinking that it might be a lot more stylish & / or violent than I was led to believe . It is the first part , but of the second part it is but only up to a point . This is a 1950s style epic tale through and through , and the violence is done in a kind of sweepingly done style , where it goes by fairly quick , no blood at all , though all the while there's the sense of loss that goes with seeing , for example , the big battle sequence early on . This is a trilogy that I saw long ago , but this one , along with some scenes from 2 and 3 , sticks out in my mind to this day . There's a lot of touching care taken in what was Hiroshi Inagaki's power as a filmmaker . Like a Hollywood director actually more than a typical Japanese director , one might say , his take on the legendary samurai Miyamoto is one of reverence but wisdom , of production values of the highest standard ( of the studio standard of Toho at the time ) , with brilliant color photography putting the colors in striking displays throughout at a time when Japan was first getting into it . If it's less than really great , like a Kurosawa film , it's maybe because Inagaki is a little too comfortable at times with what's ' safe ' in the story , particularly with the romance between Takezo / Musashi ( Toshiro Mifune ) and Otsu ( Kaoru Yachigusa ) . This actually becomes a little more unbelievable at times in parts 2 and 3 , but for the sake of its magisterial , dedicated studio roots , it's not that bad , most notably the final scene at the bridge . Some of the plot on the first viewing may not be completely clear , at least through parts of the middle section involving the betrayals and Takezo's friend Matahachi's relationship with Oko . There are one or two really noteworthy supporting performances , like from Mitsuko Mito as Oko . But it's really Mifune's show here , and he plays Takezo in this film like a more naive but still as ambitious and unruly version of his character in Seven Samurai . He's not altogether , but he has it in him to be more , which of course then leads out into the rest of the trilogy . It's one of his better performances outside of his work with Kurosawa , and it gets better as the films go on . Of course , it's best to start here with Inagaki's passionate , rousing work , and even if it isn't the best of the three it still has its high points . It's a very good example of an ' old-school ' , big-budget Toho picture with their brand of excitement and romance . If you're thinking it will be as graphic or darkly comic as Kurosawa's films though , it's not really here ( though only in little sparks , as is more Inagaki's straghtforward style ) .
510613	453068	60305	8.0	not bad at all , actually very good and meticulously structured heist movie , but not great	I had seen nearly everything that is readily available from Jean-Pierre Melville in the United States by the time I got to Le Deuxieme soufflé , which may be part of why I didn't respond overwhelmingly to it . After such challenging , methodical and precisely existential crime masterpieces as Le Samourai , Le Cercle Rouge , Bob le flambeur and the underrated Le Doulos , this one just seemed to not pack the same kind of punch that the others did . Again , this may be the fault on the viewer for seeing this last among his mostly thriller-oriented oeuvre , but perhaps it's also some of Melville's fault too ; again and again , as the dedicated and ruthless auteur that he was ( one of the great French directors I would argue ) , he kept coming back to men in trench-coats with grim expressions figuring out on both sides - criminal and detective - of how to plot the next move or , for the former , how to keep from the fatalism of the plot . Which , for Melville , is something that comes second nature . The difference , perhaps , in this case is that the length ( a whopping two and a half hours , longer than both The Red Circle and Army of Shadows ) and the amount of details in the structure of the story ( i . e . what happened on such and such a day made this happened could've been snipped , albeit I can't pinpoint to which ) bog down some of the more successful aspects to the picture . Which is also to say that for all of its minor misgivings , Le Deuxieme soufflé ( or , simply , The Second Breath ) is near-classic Melville , with nail-bitingly tense suspense scenes like the opening escape from the prison and the latter heist sequence - somewhat more obvious and less coolly ambitious as Red Circle . There's the amazing cinematography as well , a trademark of Melville and his crew to make things gritty but smooth in precision and style , and the performances from Paul Meurisse as the Detective ( maybe my favorite performance of the picture just for the intelligence he imbues in the character ) , and Lino Ventura as one of the quintessential Melville anti-heroes , Gu , the convict who wants in on the big 200 million heist . And even as it could be Melville's most " talky " picture after Bob le flambeur ( which is relative to how pleasantly light , or how seemingly sparse , his films are with dialog ) , when the characters speak it's to the point of with some quotable spunk to them . There's an icy , unspoken angst in Melville's world of criminals , almost questioning but still true to the notion of the ' policier ' , where you'd want the criminals to get away with it if the detective wasn't so doggone determined all the time . It's another fine piece of film-making from the director , just not an all-time-top flick - more along the lines of Un flic .
510579	453068	473444	8.0	sometimes a grandiose historical epic , but mostly a lurid , totally absorbing royal family drama ; one of Yimou's best	Even with flaws and all - and there are a couple at least here in Curse of the Golden Flower - I can only think of a handful of filmmakers that have shot to the moon like this and gotten away with it . Zhang Yimou tried it before with Hero and , for me , sort of didn't pull through completely successfully ( not that it hasn't gained its share of fans , and House of Flying Daggers was actually incredible ( both for being able to pull off its wacky high-flying action scenes and scoring as a romantic drama ) and the top of the pops in Yimou's big-budget melodramas . ' Golden Flower ' comes pretty close , if not totally , to ' Flying Daggers ' successes , even if it's possibly even more entertaining and acted on a level that goes to the lengths of emotional absurdity . I don't think I could ever see an American action-epic with the kinds of dark , secret , and lost characters in a film like this , and while I would say the action sequences and battles in said Western counterparts might make a little more sense , the pageantry and power of the visuals strikes this one a bit more extraordinary . I wish I could put the plot into context , but it might take too long , and it's already provided on the main page of the site . Suffice to say though it's a mouthful to try and explain it all in one piece ; simply put , we're given a tragedy as it unfolds more so on the personal level up until the last half hour , where Emperor Ping ( Chow Yun Fat ) and his Empress Phoenix ( Gong Li ) are in a crippled marriage , and hidden behind the rituals and strict decorum and everyday mercies of circumstance there's hatred on both sides , with the Emperor plotting his wife's murder via poison in the medicine she drinks , and once discovered her plot against him through various channels . There's also the Freudian ties between the sons - two from both of them and one from the Emperor and a previous woman ( who will be of significance to much of the picture ) - including not only a liaison between mother and step-son , but between a half-brother and half-sister . In between an amazing bout that occurs with quasi-Chinese ninjas storming the Phyisican and his wife's home , including grappling hooks and chaos and a chase , and a massively epic battle sequence in the Emperor's enormous stretch of royal grounds , there are many scenes that are intimately attuned for the actors , and pitched just high enough to make it delirious fun and sobering in sadness . Sure , it's over-the-top stuff that one might read in another permutation in a trashy supermarket novel , but Yimou is smart enough to let the actors take this material to work much better than one would expect . Gong Li , really , is the centerpiece here as the Empress torn by a life of diligent servitude , only to find that her long-standing sickness is not getting any better ( there are a few scenes of power where she almost breaks down in cold sweats and shaking fits ) , and her allegiances become all the more torn , twisted and fragmented by the poison doing bad things to her mind , and to her tryst with her step-son , and to her intentions towards her wretched husband . It's a great performance , worthy of Luchino Visconti , whom I thought of a couple of times watching the picture in terms of comparing operatic to operatic . Chow Yun Fat , too , is fantastic at being the man who corrupts not necessarily really his control over his empire , but that he can't tell through the third person referrals from his children what's really going on . The scenes of revelations during the last half hour , which include him showing the true state of his hair ( a real wicked moment ) , are some of the best of the film . The rest of the cast , too , does pretty well for themselves , even if one or two of them ( mostly the youngest son ) don't take too much to the over-the-top styling . And the over-the-top , sensationalism of the picture does have its drawbacks , too . I'll need to see the film again to totally understand things in terms of the action set-pieces , like which side was which ( I did finally get a sense of what happened by film's end , of course , but like with Hero I felt a little boggled ) . The music is also monotonous from time to time , albeit with touches of grace and just-right flamboyance . And there might be almost TOO much to put into suspension of disbelief with some of the dysfunctions in the family chain ( s ) , like with Prince Wan and his little girl-on-the-side who's really more than either would think of to be . But I really put myself into not just the operatic intonations , the Shakespeare-goes-Eastern story and characters which highlight the madness and decay in royalty , but the epic scope of the picture as well . The costume design , up for an Oscar , is a small marvel , though the production and art design ranks up with the best I've seen in the decade , where the colors are more than lush , as if out of some artist's fever-dream interpretation of what the insides of a palace look like . And Yimou's camera moves along this world - and gets the battle scenes - with the efficiency and skill that he's been building towards since Hero . Even if what you see might seem all too ridiculous , you likely can't take your eyes away . Is ' Golden Flower ' almost too morbid ? Perhaps , and the characters run the risk of veering off into being cheap in its melodrama . This being said , it ends up working on all of its levels , more or less , and it thrills while it pokes into the psychologies of its magisterial characters , and it ends on a very stirring note .
508748	453068	425598	8.0	misleading ( thought not disappointing ) if you're looking for a Chappelle comedy movie . . .	. . . However as a rap-concert movie , it's one of the better ones I've seen in quite a while . It works for a few reasons , though for some it may not work as well as for others . Basically , if you're coming into this expecting Chappelle doing more of his stand-up & / or sketches , you'll wonder how you could've been misled ( not that his moments on screen don't elicit enough laughs for satisfaction , at least for a Chappelle admirer like myself ) - in fact many white audience members going into the film walked out of screenings . If this is due to the film-making style or something wrong on the end of director Michel Gondry , or just not caring for the rap and hip-hop , is up for debate . But considering the kind of mix of better-than-usual rap music , solid cinema verier style camera-work by Gondry and his small crew , and the fine bits of interview footage , it's actually not a bad film if you go into it knowing what you'll get . For some it may be one of the film events of the season & / or year . One reason it worked is that - and this is of course a subjective part of seeing Block Party - the musical acts are better than most of the rap and hip-hop currently heard on radio and seen on the music channels . Led by an actual band playing music as opposed to all beat machines , the groups ( of which are Chappelle's own favorites , and some of which already appeared on the hit or miss musical segments of his show ) bring out solid beats , and the rappers or singers are not off-putting or ridiculous . The highlights for me were with Kanye West ( with a cool , powerful mix of himself and a school band for ' Jesus Walks ' ) , The Roots , and the Fugee's ' Killing Me Softly ' . There are also some cool , loose moments with Chappelle and some people backstage where he jams and riffs and jokes ( funny jokes too , albeit for the musician's expense more than for the audience ) . For someone like myself losing interest in more of the ultra-violent , idiotic and over-indulgent rap music of the day , it was not unpleasant at all to get dropped back into it with acts that were fresh and interesting ( not that there aren't some mis-steps , Dead Prez and Common not being some of the highlights for me ) . The other thing that made the film work though is Gondry's natural eye with his lens , as he just stands by getting down the attitudes , the emotions and little bits of life in the midst of this huge spectacle . There isn't anything outstanding in his style like with the Maysles brothers or DA Pennebaker in terms of capturing the music in action , and sometimes his focus strays to people on camera who take up a little too much time . But for the most part ( with some exceptions of little moments that just don't work ) his attention to the rhythm of a film , and the rhythm of film led by music - he is one of the most artistically dominant forces in music videos of the past ten or so years - is focused just right . This style also compliments Chappelle , who has a laid back kind of way of talking to people , but with a sense of humor that cuts the chase . Some of the best parts though of his moments on screen aren't expected , improvised , like the James Brown bit on stage , or his obscure ability to play two specific jazz songs on piano , or even his more juvenile jokes in jamming . In short , it's a side of Chappelle you might not usually see at times , or with Gondry , and it all gels together for the sake of the audience that showed up for the show . Nothing too pretentious , and entertaining enough to keep those interested in their seats .
509265	453068	222851	8.0	cold and dark and extremely ( but not excessively ) violent tale of Kitano in L	Brother is another of Takeshi Kitano's ' Yakuza ' thrillers , though this time the Yakuza are only a small part of the picture and only sometimes set in Japan . Akani ( Kitano ) is a hit-man who has bitten off more than he can chew - killed some of the wrong people , if at the right place at the right moment - and is advised to leave the country . He joins his brother in LA and soon he and a rag-tag group of hoodlums - mostly by way of the chilling , quiet audacity and cunning shooting skills of Anaki - rise the ranks as big-time crime lords in LA . . . that is , until , they mess with the Italians . This part of the story , admittedly , is rather typical and maybe just something Kitano felt he had to work with as one of those staples of the genre : rise and undoubted fall of a skilled but flawed criminal mastermind / killer . But Brother is most impressive not for its plot , which can occasionally appear ragged and disconnected ( perhaps by design as Kitano is the editor ) , but for presentation . Kitano himself as a presence / star / actor is so cool that had he been around during Melville's time he could wipe the floor with Alan Delon and even Belmondo in the bad-ass department . This is just one component to Brother's success though since Kitano could put himself in just about anything and make that part of it look cool . Coolness isn't enough in Brother , and rightfully so ; this isn't a fun movie entirely to watch , even if one might feel guilty in enjoying some of the more crazy shoot-outs and bouts of violence . The body count here , according to the trivia , is 78 . This is a high number , but despite seeing it in a cut R-rated version it doesn't feel very compromised ( mayhap it is and I'm being naive , but it's a first-time viewing all the same ) . It's a real sight to see to witness how Kitano makes these encounters of violence surprising ; the first big one , with the first time Omar Epps and Kitano run into each other on the street ( glass breaks , scoff and demand , glass cut to the face ) the way its edited is fantastic in timing and perception - not minimalist , but something a few beats different then what one would normally see . We also see Kitano's knack at unusual but inventive framing devices , like a dark , massive shoot-out under a bridge at night with warring gangs , and only the lights from the guns blazing off of the bodies . Other moments like these are a sight of bodies laid out in the Japanese word of " Death " , and when one gangster is already dead when a group in a car pull up to a house : Kitano focuses on that . The final shoot-out , as well , is unexpected . It's not a great movie , and suffers from the flaws mentioned at the top . Yet I'd recommend Brother to any genre fan , to those chest-deep in Yakuza flicks and one who's only aware of Kitano from Zatoichi . This is no Shoot Em Up , but a serious picture about the damning implications of a life devoted to self-destruction and annihilation for stupid , materialist and territorial goals . If it's not anything entirely new its film-making enriches what's conventional , and Kitano is always clever at bending the lines .
509655	453068	66808	8.0	pretty crazy , not altogether successful , but it's also very funny	Bananas is like a cookie-batter of all of those early Woody Allen jokes all plopped into a bowl and shaken around . It's a film loaded with political jokes , but without a direct focus aside from Cuba and dictators and the like . There are numerous sexual jokes , including one of Woody's funniest scenes involving a magazine ( the buying and holding on a subway , very silent comedy-like ) . And even Howard Cosell becomes an iconic figure in Woody's comedy in the brilliant opening scenes . The plot is very loose , so if you're looking for that look elsewhere . Also , to put it mildly , some of the jokes may not work at all for some viewers of today . But it's the go-for-broke irreverence of the picture that has it still worth viewing today . Much of Woody's own verbal bits are very good , but it's also worth to note how the physical comedy - while crude and a little off-key - also has a good ring to it . Unlike the director's later films , you can still sense that he's trying to ' get ' how to make a film , and so in trying to do anything he can think of to get a laugh , of course , some of it doesn't work . For example , in Cuba the gag where the gargantuan pile of dung is carried down the stairs with the Lain music in the background gives a grin , but not as big a laugh as might be intended . Indeed , this might be Woody's most ' immature ' film , while still containing some of his more biting , satirical jabs at dictators and oddball politics . Woody would still have this wild , go-for-broke style of humor more akin to some of his quirkier short stories in other films of the early 70s . While this isn't as successful in that regard as Sleeper or Love and Death , I'd still watch it again if it was on TV ; even the romantic subplot , undercooked in comparison with the rest of the more satirical stuff , is interesting .
508280	453068	377091	8.0	not flawless , but like Larry Clark / Harmony Korine collaborations , they get the grit of growing up teen male	I got uncomfortable sometimes during Mean Creek's second act , which is precisely what the filmmakers intentions were . I even flipped the channel for a second or two when things became a little too uneasy between the kids in the boat . I could relate to this situation very much , of kids who have no idea really how temporal everything is , and how the maturity level of almost everyone involved waxes and wanes and has to truly be tested for change to occur . In the case of Mean Creek's characters , this ends up happening through the main tragedy of the film . It's main figure , a fat kid with some problems of his own , ends up having to cause this change through his own undoing . But it's not even about that as really the cost of a life that young and ignorant ; it's the atmosphere of fear , contempt , revenge , and spite that ends up drawing the characters to their main focus of conscience . The last act that measures this is strong up to a point ; it sort of ends a little abruptly and suddenly and oddly ( the mother AND Culkin's character going out to that certain spot , not believable to me ) . And the actors in general are quite good for their age if a little spotty too . But there was rarely a moment , particularly for the first half , that I didn't buy into . It's almost like one of those true-crime case stories put to dramatization , yet infused with that spirit of the Larry Clark & / or Harmony Korine films . These kids are really on the fringe , and it's there where they can get pushy , nasty , funny ( in a childish way ) , and estranged from leading something of a " normal " life . It's a good , sometimes really intense film about dysfunctional ties between family , friends , and foes in those damned adolescent years , and a kind of extreme case that had me glued to the screen , whenever it wasn't too close to home anyway .
508420	453068	44386	8.0	as conventional storytelling it's pretty standard , but as a Bunuel picture it's got plenty of subversion in store	In maybe his only time of giving into a commercial project , Luis Bunuel , deliciously notorious surrealist and satirist , took off his usual run of Mexican-produced films of the decade and adapted The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe . On the surface , if one weren't familiar with the director's works at all , it has the seeming quality of being an average B-movie adventure of a man in solitude who is saved by his man Friday and his own resourcefulness . The story of the cast away has ended up having better days , specifically in Zemeckis's Cast Away , as far as with how the actual details of the story unfurl . It boils down to this : Crusoe gets shipwrecked on an island , takes what he can from the ship ( some supplies , actually lots , a few animals ) , builds a camp , and little by little after the novelty of a deserted island wears off he goes near mad in loneliness . That is until the cannibals arrive , dropping off a man whom Robinson names Friday and quasi-domesticates as his servant-cum-friend . This is a story that even school-children know , and has even appeared as a goof on a Peabody & Sherman cartoon . But the fun in watching this rendition of Crusoe is for fans of the director to see what he does with the material . It's not a perfect affair , truth be told , as Bunuel isn't the greatest director of suspense , particularly in the climax . But what is essential for a film with as basic a plot as this to have is an understanding of what can be subverted , lightly and slightly twisted into personal expression . This is nothing new for many of today's famous filmmakers ala Spielberg or Scorsese , but for Bunuel he approaches it in ways that his best fans will be keen to look for and get in nice quantities . For example , as he is known more often than not as a director of dreams ( his best film , Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie , has dreams within dreams in savagely playful fashion ) , we see Crusoe having a dream early on where there's soft gel on the sides of the screen ( maybe to appease the producers , who knows ) , and in it Crusoe dreams of his father pouring sauce or other on a pig , and images of Crusoe in water , cut together and acted in truly classic style . It's probably even one of his better dream sequences , followed up by another later on that features a pretty funny image to boot . Actually , part of what makes Bunuel's Robinson Crusoe so enjoyable is spotting the references to past films - his palm covered with some bugs speaks right away cheerfully to Un Chien Andalou - as well as just mildly absurd usages of animals on screen ( how did the cat have kittens ? ) , and even Christian imagery in simply showing Crusoe with his huge beard , which Dan O'Hearlihy sports proudly for most of the film , and even carrying what looks like a cross ( ! ) but turns out to be the stand for a scarecrow . Then there's also the aspect to the bond between Crusoe and Friday , which is almost a pop-art form of one of Bunuel's own treatises on the division of the classes in many of his films ( i . e . Viridiana and Exterminating Angel ) . In a way it works just as well as a simple story anyway , because Bunuel is able to have his cake and eat it , by having a tale that as stilted it might be in its not-quite-high-or-low budget and form of writing / narration at times is fairly gripping in an ' old-school ' way , as well as enough room to bring out his flashes of brilliant imagery and jabs of surrealism , and even absurdism .
510433	453068	734600	9.0	one of the great modern re-tellings of the boy who cried wolf , Twilight Zone style of course	Amazing to say , I had never seen the original Twilight Zone episode Nightmare at 20 , 000 Feet , even as it's one of the most notorious / popular episodes ( two sides of the same Rod Serling coin ) . Needless to say I already knew what was coming - it's a major credit to the episode that the episode spurred on many imitators and homages ( I saw it first redone on the Simpsons during one of the Treehouse of Terror segments ) . In its original form , with the " gremlin " that appears on the wing about as hokey as a third-rate Halloween costume ( albeit with a decent job with the face makeup ) . But it's sort of crucial for the period for it to be a very simple creature , as it may ( or may not ) all be in Bob Wilson's consciousness ( or subconsciousness ) . Today they would've done the episode in CGI , with an overly terrifying costume and makeup job , or at the least using an animatronic character . As goofy and at first unintentionally funny it is , it works really well as a springboard for Bob's visions . The real focus isn't the gremlin , anyway , but the reactions to the claim being made , and the mounting apprehension to it , and just outright ' what ? ' attitude to him . It's not to say that a lot of this is outright scary ; Shatner isn't the only one who over the passing of time has laughable facial expressions ( the wife , played by Christine Wilson , gives a few glances that inspire laughter more than complete terror ) . But there is always an underlying tension though , and supplied by Richard Matheson the buildup and climax does work to an intense effect . The line does straddle from displaying the paranoia and mind-set of this guy and being silly , and luckily directed by Richard Donner there's always a clear enough story with a few great images ( Shatner almost flung out of the plane , shooting the gun , is an indelible image ) . Sure , it's gone tame , sure it's got Shatner pre-Star Trek going through dialog like it's all his own to chew , and sure the conclusion is a given . But it's got a deft skill all the way .
508791	453068	765429	9.0	a big , intense American crime movie , led by stars and director in top form	American Gangster seems on the surface to be what has been dubbed by some critics as " the black Scarface . " As Ridley Scott's new film details , this isn't really the case aside from the point of ' rose up from nothing became something through crime ' , which could be said about almost every gangster film including the Godfather . Here Scott and screenwriter Steve Zaillian , without calling attention to it ala Paul Haggis , have made a film about class issues underneath the typical gangster-movie form . Even more than the Departed , one sees as the film goes on an environment of paradox : Frank Lucas was a low-life , a killer , a ruthless thug , and at the same time found time to take his mother to church every Sunday and gave out turkeys to folks in the neighborhood while providing them enough dope to die off in the process . In fact , Scarface has got nothing on Frank Lucas when it comes to moral complexity : here's a man who did rise up out of poverty , learned the stakes of gang life as a driver for the Harlem boss for fifteen years , and then after he died cut out the middle-man as an importer of the freshest product of heroin right out of Vietnam . Then through this there's a whole other level to American Gangster ; Scott and Zaillian could have made it simply a saga of betrayals and investigation via Richie Roberts . But the side that one saw in Serpico is amplified here - it becomes all the more engrossing to see how the crooked cops and " honest " gangster Lucas were linked together , which also leads to an ending that amps up the interest . Lucas didn't get out like Henry Hill , but a good man all the same ? Probably not ( he ended up in jail again , as the film doesn't point out ) . So there's a lot of story to explore , and Scott makes it one of the most invigorating , nostalgic ( ironically speaking ) New York crime films in years , as far as the storytelling goes . And like Heat , Scott gets a lot of mileage from his star power . Washington goes even deeper into the role of the villain than he did in Training Day - he plays him as classic family man , cold businessman , and charming man-of-the-community . He makes it so much his role that you can't imagine anyone else going down a Harlem street shooting a guy point blank in the head . And Crowe also adds some good subtlety to the piece , a flawed man with his family and someone who tries to keep his morality straight ( the million dollars given in to the station ) amidst total bully-crooks like Josh Brolin's " special " detective . By the time the two stars finally sit down for one scene , it's on par with De Niro and Pacino . Why not a or 4 stars ? It is , despite a rightfully fleshed out narrative , with some unnecessary bits ( Cuba Gooding Jr , what happened there ? ) on a two hour and forty minute picture . But Scott does make American Gangster gain momentum as it goes along and reaches a powerhouse climax that is first intense and bloody ( it IS Scott after all ) , followed by a striking human angle . And it holds nothing on Scarface , at the end of it all , as far as being legitimately dramatic without the ham , as the actors and director click for most part on material that just needs to be told without any pretension - and with that dose of significance of real urban crime in the 1970s in NYC .
508109	453068	70643	9.0	unusual character study / road movie that could only be made in the 70s	Scarecrow is a low-key film that succeeds on all its ambitions , but not because it tries to aim low . That the tone at times doesn't feel as emotionally incredible or intense as some other films Gene Hackman and Al Pacino got their star-making turns in the 70s ( French Connection , Dog Day Afternoon , Serpico ) doesn't mean it's unsuccessful either . Jerry Schatzberg and his writer are out to capture a kind of outsider view of men trying to find their places in society , almost like how Michael Cimino would do ( to a more genre-oriented extent ) with Thunderbolt and Lightfoot . It's not a movie a lot of people would go out of their way to see , even with the star power involved . It's about two guys who've been released from confinement from the world around them , Max from six years in jail ( Hackman ) , Francis from five years out at sea in the Navy ( Pacino ) , and how the two meet up unintentionally while hitchhiking , unlikely pair up , and Hackman gets Pacino to go in with him on opening up a car wash in Pittsburgh . Why Pittsburgh ? Just one of the peculiarities of Max , mayhap ? More-so a thing of pride . There's characteristics to Max and Francis that make them compelling for the honesty in what they are : Max is a tough guy , tending to get drunk , get in fights , sex it up with women ( who knew Hackman had such , um , animal magnetism ) , and Francis ( also named Lion by Max ) is a clown , a little boy who somehow made the mistake of having a kid with a woman before he left the Navy , and has a present ready to give to the kid in Detroit - an androgynous lamp - despite not knowing entirely what to expect . It's an odd couple movie , but also one that has a more affecting view into a world of men on the fringe of society . These guys don't have big plans , and wouldn't want any anyway . It's refreshing to see that , and how it pans into the nature of them and their environment : the small towns , the local dives , the bad drunks , and , when things go bad after a big brawl during a drunken hoopla , the subtle horrors of prison for the both of them . Did I mention train-hopping ? A film like this , despite having on its side gorgeous cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond ( who , along with Badlands and , in its own way Mean Streets , captures a vision of Americana that is pure and unique to its time and place ) , needs strong acting . Who better than Hackman and Pacino ? They're playing big personalities , with Hackman doing great as always in a somewhat typical part of a guy who's aggressive and pig-headed but does have a hear . And Pacino doing a rare comedic turn as he gives some of his funniest ( genuine , not unintentional scene-stealing ) moments , like his ' diversion ' gone wrong in the clothing store , or his classic " teach me how to handle a drunk " bit at the bar . Sometimes its too much , but it leads to a bittersweet side to the story that turns even more bitter by the time Schatzberg reaches the emotional climax in Detroit . What's been alternately crude and crazy , sometimes in ways that remind one a little of Altman , turns towards what is a small but great tragedy for these characters . And doing the script one better , the actors are able to get subtle , crushing , telling moments in scenes that others wouldn't be able to grasp with a ten-foot pole . It's also a fun movie , with a feel that you could only get in one of the truly great years in all movies ( look at the year this came out , and realize how many films of its ilk were released , be they independent-like from Scorsese or Altman or Ashby or even Romero , or even Friedkin's Exorcist ) . Scarecrow is of its time , but it doesn't mean it can't be greatly liked in the present ; it's even a near classic of genre subversion , doing a service to drama and comedy by not paying lip-service to either form , but enriching what comes naturally out of life , which is both sometimes , harrowingly , at once .
508752	453068	56905	9.0	a film that challenges audience's expectations to the conventions of a war film	One of Godard's better films from the 60's , which like a number of his films from his prime era is usually either liked a lot or detested to hell , is almost audience-dividing on purpose . His film is a black comedy that sometimes is ( successfully ) deceptively a bleak drama of corruption of the working man in times of War . Stylistically it is Godard all the way , though one can't disregard the likely significant contributions ( though it may be hard to detect since it IS Godard's mouth all over the pie so to speak ) of screenwriters Jean Gurault ( usually Truffaut's co-writer ) , and ( apparently ) Roberto Rossellini . Rossellini , who was one of Godard's big influences , is countered by what was also a big influence likely on this picture , Samuel Fuller , the king of B War pictures . So one could look at the quasi-split of ideals in the film , of Rossellini's documentary style of telling it like it is , crossed with Fuller's hard professionalism and no-holds-barred view of War . Whomever influence comes through stronger , this is really Godard's show , and has here something that is fairly usual in terms of his challenging styles and criticizing past films ( including Truffaut with his own comments on War depicted in film ) , but also is unique for how it is presented , and makes it a difficult , though rewarding experience . This is the French new-wave equivalent , to put it another way , to Sam Mendes's Jarhead ; you're not sure if this really should be classified as a typical ' war ' film , despite being in a league of other films already in place . One thing that is as fascinating as it is occasionally frustrating is Godard's main male actors , Albert Muross and Marino Mase , are not very expressive , and of course are not really ' actors ' in the traditional sense ( at least at the time they were close to un-professionals ) . But maybe that is what's needed , dumb farm boys who are propogandized into going to fight for their invading , nameless country ; the opening scenes of the list of things the men will get is equally funny and troubling . Then the boys go off to war , and there is a really astute episodic kind of storytelling used , which works considering the short time length . One scene that really stood out was when one of the soldiers goes to see his first film ever , and is almost like some kind of primate seeing a woman disrobing on a screen ( it's also arguably the funniest scene in the film ) . When the boys come home they are loaded with pictures , in a scene that is the one that almost had me questioning if it was either really good or really too long ; the length of the list of pictures is like a litmus test for moviegoers - can you take all of these images , done almost to make a point that's not too clear ? But what makes Les Carabiniers work for me is how it is so un-like other war films that it stands alone on its own terms , like a French new-wave Dr . Strangelove ( though maybe not a masterpiece like that one ) . At times I wasn't totally sure where the satire started or ended , and there is a certain distance that Godard places with his many long-shots getting in as much landscape as tanks and soldiers with their guns . What's surprising is how the tone is always assured , which is crucial considering this is a story told through the side of the invaders this time , men working under their elusive King for land and riches and wealth . One of the best scenes I may have seen in any Godard film is when they have a woman who is at first thought to be ' a friend ' of the soldiers , but then goes off on a Leninist rant . The men are about to shoot her , but can't for a few minutes , as the words she says strike some kind of chord in their primal mindsets . Amid montages of archive footage of planes flying and bombs dropping , there's a scene that would never ever be in any ' conventional ' war picture . There's a real thought process going on here , and even if it's got some of Godard's usual ' f you , it's my style , take it or leave it ' attitude , it's not totally un-accessible either . It's a slim volume of gritty anti-War pathos , and it's maybe a tad under-rated in the director's massive catalog .
510429	453068	92020	9.0	a contender for my favorite Quay brothers film	I like the Brothers Quay work in small doses , and all at once with one film coming after another it becomes too staggering an experience to handle . But seeing Street of Crocodiles really made it for me in terms of connecting it to other Quay brothers work , in terms of how their surreal representations and obsessions and neuroses come into their work , and how it pulled off so well this time . A lot of time their avant-garde impulses almost get the better of them , and many a fantastic image and sound is presented but without much context , leaving it almost impenetrable . I didn't get that this time around with this film - which happened to make Terry Gilliam's top 10 favorite animated films of all time - as it presents its ideas a little more coherently , and unlike other Quay work it ends not on a sudden beat but on one that actually makes sense , in its own non-sensical form . It's really just one of the most pure visualizations of a nightmare world envisaged , as a puppeteer opens up a box and looks in at a figure moving around in this run down slum of a city , where screws continually keep unscrewing from their places and deformed dolls go about as they please performing grisly tasks . This animated figure ( who really is anything but animated , as the character doesn't move around too much , except to continually look at things that perhaps he shouldn't , or doesn't understand at first ) gets embroiled in the dolls ' plans , which may or may not involve unscrewing his own head as well . At times it seemed like the Quays could go off again into the wormholes of their own visions , but they resist the temptation to go completely with the narrative - whatever there is of it anyway . Disorder and decay were words that kept floating in my mind , and all amid an atmosphere of not necessarily despair , but one that lacked much hope for any of its minions . Featuring some of the most inventive production design I've seen in any stop-motion film , and cinematography that still stuns me hours after watching it , it's a real little marvel of what can come out of the darkest corners of the mind , put to light and molded with the utmost care .
508097	453068	71502	9.0	it shouldn't work , but it does - a series of stories of the bizarre and romantic ( or erotic , take your pick )	Whether or not you like some ( or just respond positively to some ) of Pier Paolo Pasolini's work , or you don't , will depend on how much one can take of provocative subject matter put forward in an upfront manner . For me , he's a director that can go both ways , be it completely muddled and pretentious ( Teorema ) or almost boring in its S & M tactics of twisted satire ( Salo ) , or actually dramatically engaging ( Mamma Roma ) , and he's never someone who takes the easy road . Arabian Nights is another one , as part of a ' trilogy ' of films adapted from famous , erotically-laced works of stories that have scandalized for centuries ( the others the Decameron and Canterbury Nights ) . Once again , Pasolini has a lot of people in his film that aren't actors , or even real extras - sometimes some people will just pop out , or a bunch of kids will run around , and they're plucked right from the scenery . If authentic , film fans , is what you want , Pasonili gives it , in all of the style of a guy out to shoot a documentary on the people in these settings and gets ( pleasantly ) sidetracked by a bunch of crazy-tragic stories of love and lust in the desert . As if done in a pre-Pulp Fiction attempt at non-linear storytelling , we get the tale of Zumurrud ( Ines Pellegini ) and Nur ed din ( Franco Merli ) , one a slave who is bought by the most innocent looking kid in the bunch of bidders . They fall in love , the wise young girl and naive grunt , but they get separated after she gets sold to another man . She escapes , but becomes the unwitting king after she is mistaken for a man . Meanwhile , her young little man is calling after her / him , and getting into his own trouble . Through this framework , we get other stories told of love lost and scrambled ; a sad and silly story of a man who's engaged to his cousin , and is thwarted by a mysterious woman who gets his attention , which leads him down a path of semantics ( yes , semantics , poetry-style ) and sex , leaving his much caring cousin behind . Then there's the man who woos a woman who is under the ownership of a demon , and once their affair is discovered some unexpected things happen via the Demon ( Franco Citti , maybe the most bad-ass character in the film despite the surreal-aspect of the showdown ) . And then one more story , which , hmm . . . . I could go on making descriptions , but then this wouldn't be much of a review of praise of the picture . Suffice to say it's one of Pasolini's strongest directed efforts , where he's surefire in his consistent usage of the hand-held lens , getting his actors to look sincere through dialog that is half ripped-from-the-pages and half with the sensibility of Pasolini as a poet ( yes , I went there in the whole ' he's a poet ' thing , but he is in a rough-edged and melodramatic timing and flow ) . He's also going for an interesting combo ; neo-realist settings for a good chunk of the picture , set in and around real locations in areas that don't need much production design , and an epic sweep that includes many extras , some special effects at times ( and how about that lion ! ) , and extravagant costumes . I also liked - if not loved - how Pasonili dealt with sex and more-so the human body itself . It would probably rightfully get an NC-17 if released today in America , and got an X when released in 1980 . The dreaded ' thing ' of a man is revealed about as often as a cut-away to a master shot of a building . Everything , in fact , is filmed frankly , without the style that tip-toes around the starkness of two people embraced and naked . But it's also not pornographic either ; if anything Pasolini perhaps doesn't direct far enough with the sex , as one body just lays still on top of another . There's a specific intent to dealing with sexuality in this world that respects lust and desire from the original text without making it blatant - only in one big instance , involving the fate of the man from the cousin story ( the one with Aziz I think ) revels in the horror of sex that was delved tenfold in Salo . Add to this the exquisite score from Ennio Morricone , who enriches any scene his score pops up , as a mandolin strings away and the strings rise with just a hint of the sentimental . Without Morricone , in fact , it might not be as emotional a film , when need be . And lest not forget Arabian Nights can be strangely comical , where Pasolini throws it back at the audience that he knows he's going ( rightfully ) into the surreal . Like with the story of the Demon and the fate of a man transformed as a chimpanzee , or the vision with the lion , or even the dialog in the pool with the three girls and the man , which is humorous while keeping a tongue-in-cheek . And there's even some good jokes to come out of the obvious step of having Zummurrud as the ' King ' when it's clear as day from the Italian dubbing that he's the ' she ' , so to speak , as it stretches out into a final scene where lovers are united and things are as they should be , however much the director is thumbing his nose at power and sex and the dealings of the heart with organs . Arabian Nights probably couldn't be made today , but could anyone else but Pasolini make it anyway ? There's daring in this film , and through the exotic exteriors and sets we see a filmmaker working along like there's nothing else to stop him , for better or worse . This time for the better .
509469	453068	78935	9.0	Good times , Cannibal Salad	Cannibal Holocaust was not something I exactly wanted to see , and I didn't rush out out to buy it the day Grindhouse releasing put out the uncut version on DVD . But I kept hearing that it was a movie that , if someone very interested in films - or just in the most shocking in the realm of cult and exploitation - this was something to see at least once . It's called the most notorious of its kind , and after watching it tonight I can report that it's not far from the truth . It is shocking , and horrifying , and makes you feel about the human race that everything at base level is so barbaric that it might not be worth a damn . But what could be just another schlock-fest from a director who just wants to chuck crap up on the screen in the form of bad acting and blood and poor craftsmanship actually isn't what's served up . On this level , it way exceeded any expectations I had , and is in fact one of the more satisfying exploitation pictures of the period . This is mostly due in part to the dedication on part of Ruggero Deodato to actually tell a story reasonably well , and to even throw in some biting ( however shallow ) commentary on the state of sensationalism on the news and how colonialism seems to repeat itself when the opportunity knocks with the wrong bunch of Westerners . The first half of the movie is told in a straightforward style , shot without any amateurish meddling however in low-budget form , as a professor at NYU goes on a search with a couple of guides to locate a documentary film crew that went missing in the South American jungles . From the outset , we're led to believe the worst has occurred , that the film crew got slaughtered and eaten by a tribe of cannibal natives . Some pieces end up standing out as shocking already , like a moment where we see how a man " deals " with an unfaithful woman , but for the most part it's relatively with only bits of action and terror . The second half , however , is when things get ugly as the professor , back in New York , looks over the footage shot on 16mm by the crew and sees how things really went down . Is it perhaps a little much on the part of Deodato to show how cruel and vicious and to a point fake the documentary filmmakers are in treating their subjects ? Yes and no ; yes because of course it is exploiting the expectations of the audience , and making it easy for us to not feel any sympathy for when the bloody , " realistic " climax rolls around , but not so much because he and his cast do it so convincingly . This is unlike the more recent Cloverfield where we're made to feel sympathy for the characters but are not given much of a reason to do so on the outset of this ' docu-real ' scenario . And there's also a stark message underlying this which is cyclical in nature , and without stating the very obvious last line that the professor makes at the end of the picture it is , in fact , a question of barbarism . I should point out that even when Cannibal Holocaust is at its most effective it's not any kind of ' great ' movie . It left me shaken and stirred and a little repulsed , sometimes a lot ( the turtle scene somehow really got to me more than anything , if only for the time and detail spent in wallowing in it , which was the correct decision based on the atmosphere ) , but it is only as good ( or bad depending on view ) as it can be based on the action and low-budget direction and make-up effects . Sometimes it is somewhat shoddy in production value , or in talent . But most of its flaws are supplemented by Deodatto's rigorous attempt at for one never making it boring , which is crucial for an exploitation picture in retrospect , and for also keeping the story focused and the continuing situation tense and bleak amid the shock value . There's some things committed here that I dare not reveal , but only so you can experience them yourself in all their faux-realism that , at the end of it all , has a slight , nasty satirical kick . There's guts here , no pun intended , and it's everything you've heard and then some - oddly enough , also a well-directed picture , despite the director's own ashamed ( though understandable ) feelings about the making of it today . Don't watch this alone !
510708	453068	362225	9.0	a pretzel factory of a thriller ; convoluted but compulsively watchable	It's easy to see how it can be done , but only so often do we get some good ' knock-offs ' of Hitchcock films . Sometimes we get outright homages like with Brian De Palma , or we get cheap rip-offs that some of us never see unless digging deep into the thriller bin at Blockbuster . Luckily , the French seem to have it licked , and in this case director Guillaume Canet takes Harlan Coben's pot-boiler and makes it into riveting if not quite linear film-making . You have to stay with the picture as it goes along - at times you may get so confused you'll want to give up - but if you can give yourself just a bit to the twists and paranoia , it's very rewarding . It's in very simple terms about Alex ( Dustin Hoffman look-alike François Cluzet ) and his wife Margot ( stunning-looking Marie-Josee Croze ) , who one night go skinny dipping and . . . no , not one of ' those ' movies ( slasher ) . But murder is involved , and we're made to believe Margot was killed and Alex was knocked unconscious that night . Then the story jumps ahead eight years later , when Dr . Alex Beck is now living alone and still sort of mourning his wife as the anniversary of her death comes around . And yet , even as the case seemed to be closed , the police still have suspicions about Alex since he doesn't remember how he got out of the water onto the dock before being knocked out . Another two bodies are found buried near the original murder site , and the case is reopened , with Alex now once again a suspect . Then something else happens . . . I don't want to mention much else , for fear of spoiling the daylights ( or just boring the hell out of you with exposition ) , but suffice to say it becomes a mix of elements from the likes of Fugitive , Vertigo ( yes , Vertigo , at least one element anyway ) , and several of Hitchcock's " wrong man on the run " movies . There are things that the director does to keep things moving and fast-paced for fans of real hardcore thrillers ( a chase midway through the film might just top Fugitive for sheer audacious move on the part of the hero ) , but he also makes the audience pay attention very closely to details . Just a subtle close-up of a computer screen with a ' new email ' , or a moment with Alex's dog , or even a U2 song . And it's crucial to keep up with small scenes that shouldn't seem like they mean much ; the director understands all of the components of a warped mystery where characters and motives and even simple twists in a single bound are not what they seem . Luckily , there is time in the last section of the story where a certain character ( I won't say who but it's an older one ) who can expound on the exposition that thankfully puts most of the pieces of the story into place . But then even after things are explained , it gets one talking about what's just happened , if everything made sense , and not in that " damn that was no good , too confusing " way . It doesn't underestimate the audience's intelligence or manner to keep up with a story that involves murder , love , lust , cover-ups , power-plays , old rich French guys , and and even a sliver of social commentary at one point . And the cast is uniformly terrific ; saying that Clement is like Dustin Hoffman isn't just as comparison in looks , as he's really got the stuff to lead this film as someone you want to stick with 100 % ( if not the Cary Grant type , then certainly Jimmy Stewart ) ; Cruze , for her moments on screen , is gorgeous and sad and happy and all those things that make up a mysterious character ; Kristen Scott Thomas - yes , Kristin Scott Thomas speaks French - is amazing for her time as a supporting character . And don't get me started on the guy who played Margot's father . It's a work of minor brilliance that , unfortunately , loses its footing in the last couple of minutes with a sentimental coda . For the most part , Tell No One is what we want to see often in American movies , but usually people aren't strong enough to just put it out there without mucking up the style . Canet is a strong director , great with a lost-in-a-pretzel-factory story , and it takes its place alongside the likes of With a Friend Like Harry , Red Lights and The Beat That My Heart Skipped as one of the superlative neo-noirs of 21st century French cinema . Sleeper-tastic !
510769	453068	121802	9.0	ingenious little short , like a newspaper comic strip with sharp wit	Thank You Mask Man is featured as a bonus on the DVD of the Lenny Bruce performance film , and I was very glad I watched it . It reminded me of what I saw once in a Carlin special from the 80s where he put in little animated bits that all visualized his bits . That this comes more than a few years before that is impressive , but more so that it actually works to fit the riff-style comedy that Bruce excelled at . This is basically drawn like , well , basics - the comic-strip characters could've been taken out of any newspaper or other , and it's all crude to the point of not having to focus as much on it . Perhaps most of the strengths , aside from the curious , off-kilter nature of the drawings , do spring out of the material , as a story of a bunch of people having to deal with a ' masked man ' on a horse . It happens to be a good Bruce bit on its own , but then the curious thing does happen that towards the end of the film - when the townspeople then all taunt Masked Man to be gay - the comedy and the look of the film do totally gel somehow . That Bruce is also behind a good part of the style of the picture himself probably explains how some of the same inspired dementia in this story in particular ( one with an absurdity to it but also some truth sprinkled around ) merges with simplistically weird animation . It's probably not one of my favorites ever , to be sure , but I had a lot of fun watching it , as a crazy little anecdote given life and still kicking more than forty years later .
509836	453068	1084950	9.0	Demme back in fine form and Hathaway with her first really fantastic performance	This pitch-black-comedy-cum-drama , Rachel Getting Married , bucks two kinds of marriage movies that are fairly common in the two sides of release : one is the schmaltzy , dumb mainstream rom-com like Maid of Honor or The Wedding Planner where A-List actors go in the motions of a batch of conventions-by-checklist , and the other is a glum , mean indie picture like Margot at the Wedding ( can't think of others right now like it's ilk , wouldn't want to ) . What helps it make it not just watchable , or appealing , but a very good movie , is the fact that the screenplay - by Sidney's daughter Jenny Lumet ( as every critic has noted ) - is very true to the tragic dimensions amid such a hectic weekend at a Connecticut , upper-middle class house where a wedding will take place with some bad memories and skeletons opened in the process . In fact , for all of Jonathan Demme's efforts to give it a raw and spontaneous energy - he's said it's akin to Altman but I sensed more-so Cassavetes - his approach works best , even at a rough-edged masterful level , when characters are talking / arguing / yelling in a room . Lumet's story involves the title character ( Rosemarie DeWitt ) in a weekend where there's much happiness for her and her to-be-spouse , and a good lot of tension because of her sister , Kym ( Hathaway ) , getting out of rehab for the weekend to come to the occasion . To say she's the black sheep is somewhat sugar-coating it , and nearly every moment Hathaway is on camera ( or , somewhat in the Altman mode , Demme manages to catch her off-guard in a moment or with a look ) is electrifying , by far her best performance if only because she finally has a character to really dig her ' acting ' heels into . It could be very easy , too easy , to make it a walking / bitching cliché , but Hathaway finds those moments , especially off of DeWitt or in one important scene with Debra Winger as her absentee mother , to make it as honest as possible . Although she is just one part of the component of the ensemble - what Demme focuses as an ensemble - it makes the film all the more remarkable than without her playing this troubled young woman with a past that puts a dark cloud over everyone around her . And around this theme of too much or ill-placed love in a family that should be nothing but happiness , Demme makes it both warm and sad in equal measure . Maybe I'm more of a sucker for harrowing familial scenes or a solid hand-held argument ala Husbands and Wives , but those come off a bit better than the bigger scenes of fun and excitement and enjoyment in the actual wedding proceedings . But just a bit - Demme's approach comes somewhere in the range of a home movie and , once or twice , reality TV , and it's a quality that , when not overboard , is really refreshing and inviting . Demme is fascinated by this multi-cultural group , with its eclectic music and irreproachable camaraderie , and he asks us to be fascinated and enjoy it with the characters . This is the only tricky part of the picture , but one I wasn't daunted by ; there's a real " indie-movie " spark here that's indescribable . At the end of it all , I'll remember Rachel Getting Married more as an exceptional experiment than a truly great film , but anyone completely sick of seeing ads for sappy marriage comedies or films that treat the families or people gearing up for a wedding like paper figures would do themselves a favor seeking it out . It is , in a square enough word , lively .
509400	453068	118540	10.0	moving , informative , and two stories interwoven exceedingly well	Spike Lee's skills as a documentarian are astonishing considering his mixed efforts in dramatic features , which ranges from greatness to failures . With 4 Little Girls and especially When the Levees Broke , Lee takes focus of the subject matter , and expands upon the narrative to make the central story intertwined without losing anything close to worthwhile to know . It goes without saying it honors the memory of those four girls slain in the church in Birmingham , but it also honors the memory for the others who died and fought in the Civl Rights battle of the early 60s ( it was a battle by way of perpetration by the likes of " Bull " O'Connell , and the rabid racists like the only man who was convicted in the late 70s of the church bombing ) . Lee starts off profiling the girls and their childhoods , their parents and childhood friends recounting their innocence , their energy , being simply kids growing up happy but in the midst of racism all around them . From there Lee branches off - using the " white / colored " segregation of something as minor as a water fountain , to branch off to Birmingham itself , its history , being the focal-point of much of the strife for black people in the south , Dr . King's eventual and crucial involvement , and the white racists . It's staggering information one learns , even if one already thinks they know all there is to know about the civil rights struggle . Just the information on Governor George Wallace ( and , surprisingly , seeing Wallace interviewed with his near-gone voice and mind ) is enough to raise repeated eyebrows in astonishment . And then Lee brings it back to the girls again , and that fateful , cursed day that one family member said she saw in a nightmare the night before . The interviews are presented with unabashed compassion for the family members , but not with misplaced sentimentality . The case itself , and how it becomes one of the pivotal pieces that , tragedy besides , leads the civil rights movement even further , has so much power that it's impossible to dramatize it . Lee simply uses music , photographs , and the faces of those who knew these girls , as well as public figures ( i . e . Kronkite , Cosby , Jesse Jackson ) , to accentuate the material . It's skillful storytelling , and told with a story that needs to be told , and revealed to those who may forget the horrors of the American south merely forty-something years ago and more . Simply , one of the director's finest ' joints ' .
508115	453068	70544	10.0	one of the trippiest things you'll ever see , bar none , and it's extraordinary in its simplicity	Fantastic Planet has about a hundredth of the technical proficiency - or just money - that any given Pixar film might have in just its first couple of reels . But there's probably just as much invention and eye-popping mind-blowing madness , if not exponentially more-so , than any recent CGI film . It's , well , art . Yes , to throw a word as big and all-encompassing like that is tricky , Fantastic Planet qualifies as some kind of weird artistic feat of surrealism and pure science fiction . And by sci-fi I mean the cream of the crop in storytelling and ideas : it's about the impact of images in a strange land being somehow completely relatable , if only in social construct or satirical forms , as though we were witnessing Gullivers Travels mixed around with Dune and then filtered through some renegade animator that got through the gates at a studio and churned something out fast . It's like a strange revelation that won't leave your mind . And yes , leave no mistake , it also works very well as a " stoner movie " , one of those ridiculously warped visions that goes into the world of the imagination so heavily , with tangential moments in scenes ( the ' blending ' of the Draags in one scene , the constant flow of various monsters , the ' mating ' ritual , the de-Oming ) , with a soundtrack that's like a outstanding , unlikely collaboration between Isaac Hayes and Pink Floyd ( you don't know whether it'll split into Dark Side or Shaft ) . Premise is simple : a little oprhaned Om named Terr is taken in as a ' pet ' of Tiwa , and is half tortured half loved by her . But , as case happens , she outgrows him , and he runs away after being filled with knowledge by some machine . Then he gets sucked into the underground world of the Oms , where there's lots of mating and other activities , such as fights ( wacko scene with those teeth-filled monsters strapped on like Gonzo gladiators ) . But their civilization is in peril , and it's time to fight back ! Lots of classic myths pumped in , but at times you almost forget there's story , which might be half the point . The director Rene Laloux , along with collaborators like Roland Topor , creates a world unequivocally unto itself , where there are real strokes with pencils and colors and inks , where it seems very much like a collection of pictures from some obscure European fable book for kids , only loaded with some kind of life-force that moves like no other animated film ( maybe it's slightest , closest-distant relative is Yellow Submarine , which is still a stretch ) . Characters move in and out occasionally like a Terry Gilliam short - giant hand and other objects placed in almost jokingly , which makes it a lot of fun at times - and there's something eerie in Laloux's dedication to pushing the expectation-level , mainly because , as noted , we haven't seen this style before . It's a quiet form of sensationalism , where it sneaks up on the viewer , and then takes over a scene , growing little by little , like some weird plant . In short , he does his job as a genre director , probably on par with the great visionaries , while using some primitive methods of animation . But through imperfections there's more expressive tendencies , moments of chance and random visions like a monster springing organically about to eat another , or to go through bizarre mating rituals as Venus de Milo statues with blue heads . Or , in other words , as my long-winded adulation goes to say , a superb " stoner movie " . Not that being sober will make you absorbed any less ; it's a compliment , in a sense , that in its glory of its time it reaches a true cult impulse , where children can enjoy its wonderful glimpses of the " fantastic " , and adults can have another more mature , thought-provoking input in its implications on power and human nature .
510799	453068	61418	10.0	one of the very best films I've ever seen ? not sure , but it surely invites another viewing	Bonnie and Clyde is , to put it in most basic terms , what Warren Beatty said to Jack Warner when the lights came up after the screening for the late studio head after he asked Beatty , " What the f did I just watch ? " Beatty replied , " It's what the French would call an ' homage . ' " Warner's response : " Ok . . . What's an homage ? " He didn't get that this was something of a kickback to movies of old while also paving the way for the future . In fact , the film was originally meant for one of the Cashiers du Cinema directors ( either Truffaut or Godard , who both passed eventually ) , who specialized in homage . Whether or not Bonnie and Clyde is a bonafide classic - it is for critics and viewers , and not without some good reason even if I'm still a little unsure of how to place it - it does have a good chance of standing the tests of time , as people are still ranting and raving about it some forty years ( and a new DVD release ) later . Short of it is the ' same old story ' , boy meets girl , girl falls for boy , boy gets girl to rob banks , girl and boy go on the run , boy can't do well in bed with girl ( wink wink , nudge nudge , say no more ) , boy and girl team up time to time with others on the run , girl and boy get gunned down by hundreds of machine gun bullets . The long of it is that Penn , his DP and his wonderful editor Dede Allen , and his cast and crew made up a kind of lyricism to the pulp material , that in-between the goofy interludes of fast-speed chase scenes and banjo-picking music , there were sprinklings of poetry , and candid sexual material . For the poetic part we see some shots that elevate this into another realm , moving not always on a beat to plot but based on mood and the locales ( one shot I distinctly remember rises above a field of grass or grain as Bonnie goes after Clyde or other ) . For the sexual part , it's the first film in American history to address impotency , and a quasi-Freudian breakdown of ID manifested through the gun and crime and showmanship . And sure , some of that banjo-picking kind of dulls the thought going into Bonnie and Clyde that this will be the most cutting-edgiest of all the cutting edge late 60s movies . But Beatty and Dunaway , as the young lovers with " nothing better to do , " as well as Hackman and Parsons ( and a cool bit part with Gene Wilder ) , are terrific to look at as they get at some complexities in each other's push-and-pull relationship , giving their all to portray the ballsy attitude of 30s gangsters while revealing in the uncertainty and existential abandon of their generation . Without going into too many platitudes about what the film meant or what impact it had at the time ( as I didn't live at the time I can only speculate or go on past records ) , Bonnie and Clyde does break ground in one respect that would definitely resonate with the likes of Peckinpah , Coppola and Scorsese : violence isn't candy-coated anymore or done for an faded effect . Inspired by the likes of Kurosawa and Russian propaganda-style editing , audiences got catapulted to the kind of state of mind that meant to transport them into the danger and mayhem of the gangster life as well as , mayhap , Vietnam , particularly with the iconic climax . As pure film-making many of these scenes , especially for the latter for which Allen was snubbed a well-deserved Oscar nomination , are incredible . Emotionally it's brutal and verging on being too chaotic for its own good . Somehow Penn is able to merge the style with the emotional impact , however , which is a marker of why Bonnie and Clyde is such a success artistically . There have probably been better films to come from this , but it remains potent nevertheless .
509674	453068	52618	10.0	still a gigantic achievement in epic film-making	What distinguishes Ben-Hur as a powerful film in epic scope is not simply that it is shot and stylized and acted and executed in action sequences to iconic effect ( though there is that to a degree ) , but that it's human dimensions stay intimate in scope . I was expecting what I had heard about with Ben-Hur , and got that - the vengeance plot , the chariot race , a story of redemption with Christ as a background figure and major presence - but I wasn't expecting such things revealed like the devastation left on a family by leprosy , and the disintegration of one's morality by the cloud of vengeance on one's mind . Even if you're not much of a Christian ( and even as a non-practicing Jew as I am ) , there are some deep chords that are struck with the material for an audience that is going in not expecting a lot of sermonizing . Only in the final reels , as we see first-hand the ' Christ ' as he is sent to die on the cross , does the film get overbearing with the symbolism and heavy weight of the circumstance of this being a " tale of the Christ . " This isn't to say also that with Judah Ben-Hur having the strife in coming to terms with his family being at first , he thinks , dead , and then later as made deformed thanks to the Roman's imprisonment , that this is all the film is . It's also grand spectacle , a film that takes you along on its epic ride with imagery that pierced the public consciousness so strongly that you've seen the scenes as parodies or referenced before you've even seen the film . Surely we have the chariot race to contend with , which has been so influential on modern action sequences and chases that Lucas copied most of the choreography for the pod race in Phantom Menace . And to give credit where it's due , you could show that same sequence in any theater today and it would unquestionably bring down the house , not just for its technical achievement but for the visceral impact ( i . e . the downfall of Ben-Hur's rival by his own undoing ) . But there's also other great images ; possibly my favorite are the scenes with Judah Ben-Hur as # 41 among the rowing slaves , all moving at the whim of the drum beat . That in and of itself would make Ben-Hur a must-see . But then there are more emotionally impactive places and settings , like the valley of the lepers , Judah's struggle across the desert ( and the tastefully done angle of Jesus ' back only ) , many others that would take too long to mention . It's all so massive a production that it's almost TOO big ( according to Charlton Heston the budget , at 14 million then as the most expensive film ever made , would today cost something like 250 million ) , and it's a credit to William Wyler that he never makes it too dull , even as supporting characters may verge on leaning to overacting . With only calling attention to it at certain moments ( and sometimes not at all with a more subtle effect ) , Wyler is a virtuoso here in corralling all aspects of the production under his firm handle . And then there's Heston , who gives one of the very best of his ( now late ) career . He's full of bravura and gusto , and seems like a guy - for those guys who crave action film stars - who can get things done in the right mindset . But he's also excellent at conveying the tragedy of this character , a very good man with high ideals who becomes corrupted by his need to get his respite . Underneath all of that machismo and the swagger that eventually became old hat for Heston , is a strong presence at the helm of Ben-Hur . Stephen Boyd , too , is also very good as the boyhood friend turned rival . In fact , most of the actors here are very good , from Hawkins to Hazareet to Jaffe to O'Donnel and so on , as they all contribute to the epic scope . It's massive and directly concerning the efforts of then Rabbi from Nazareth to bring peace and love to humanity . Despite it being not-too-thinly veiled religious fable ( and not without a couple of things noticeable as parody in Life of Brian ) , Ben-Hur is a great success for its time , surviving today in good , not-too-dated tact .
510843	453068	1017495	10.0	one of the funniest new shows on prime-time ; it's charming and witty , and with enough ' quirk ' in dialog and style	Barry Sonnenfeld was the right director to helm the opening of Pushing Daisies , an original mystery / comedy yarn about a pie-maker named Ned ( Lee Pace ) who can bring a person back to life with a touch , but there's a catch , more than one , in scheme of things . It's also about a childhood friendship that went awry , and the mending of it years later as he redeems himself ( albeit , sadly , without the " emotional Heimlich maneuvers " let alone a kiss between the two , the girl ' Chuck ' played by Anna Friel ) . It's just the perfect kind of light and frothy texture , with visually vibrant exteriors and sets and production design ( the opening field reminds one of the field that Van Gogh painted once , to get all artsy ) . But at the same time it has a kind of stinging wit to it at times , where the actors know how silly this all is , but play it straight . It's not laugh-a-minute ala the Office or cynical like House , but it's got a ring to it that's just there . The " Umph " people talk about with certain projects is here right off the bat . Aside from the chemistry the stars have ( i . e . in the scene talking about the euphemism for hugs ) , as well as funny supporting work ( Chi McBride , who's always good for a ' what the hell ' look without straining himself , and Kristin Chenowith who's adorably odd ) , it's strangely fable-like even as it has its feet set firmly in the ground of the 21st century . And at the same time there's a structure set up to it : there will be crimes solved each week , as the dead ( hopefully in one minute's time ) will give their input on a certain huge decision in their lives , the end of such . It plays freely with the unexpected while set in a near storybook narrative ( Jim Dale's narrator veers into this being like some bedtime story spiked with existential mania ) . Now , it won't be for everyone ; it almost veers into being showy with its dialog , with the wit put on and on and the incidents so bizarre in their comedy ( i . e . ' there's a truck on fire , run gravediggers , come on out of that coffin honey ' ) . It's concept , to be sure , needs a big suspension of disbelief . Yet Pushing Daisies is one thing most network TV shows aren't : fresh in irony , strong in character , and extremely , unexpectedly funny . It also helps that , for a TV show , it's got terrific direction and visual POP to it . Can't wait for more episodes !
509583	453068	30341	10.0	A merry-go-round of a Hitchcock mystery , bordering brilliantly on a yarn	Alfred Hitchcock's 2nd to last British based film in the thirties is this classic little tale of a little old lady ( played in such sweetness by Dame May Whitty ) who disapears on a train . What makes this such an interesting story to unfold in the Hitchcok tradition is that is starts off as almost a comedy of manners . Margaret Lockwood , staying in an inn , is disturbed by an odd music playing and a clumping from her ceiling . Above her the manager finds clarinet player Michael Redgrave playing to a trio dancing around in a circle . Seeing this I laughed out loud , not remembering until the first murder that I was about to see a good old Hitchcokian story unfold . Possibly one of his best mysteries , this is a pleasure for his fans to behold .
510031	453068	1157605	10.0	documentary and metal fans rejoice !	Anvil : The Story of Anvil has got those absurd moments ala Spinal Tap , to be sure . Indeed at one point when the camera follows the band walking down a hallway about to go on stage I put a hand over my eyes thinking they were about to get lost . But it's also got the heart and some similarity to The Wrestler . This is a film that has a bittersweet tattoo on its hands , mostly bitter , a bit of sweet , and a whole lot of optimism with the chaser of stress and the very upfront possibility of failure . There's such a connection to these people that what was uproarious in Spinal Tap carries a whole other dimension . Anvil is the hardest working metal band that hasn't caught a break in years , but they play and play their heart and soul out for all it's worth even when nobody ( or five people in a 10 , 000 seat arena ) shows up . They've got big balls , maybe the biggest of them all , but can they get that record break even in their Canadian homeland ? At the same time that the lead singer Lips carries that determination and optimism , now in his 50's and playing in Anvil for over 30 years , there are some moments where he just breaks down . We see real hardcore screaming matches between himself and his friend Robb Reiner ( not that Reiner , oddly enough director of ' Tap ' ) , and it's not like what one saw in 2004's Some Kind of Monster where we saw a group of millionaires whining in argument over recording an album and going into group therapy . This is about real stakes , of friendship and what it means to stick together in something that may be a failure for the most part . It's so real and raw in presentation that you are on the edge of your seat wondering " can this be the end ? " The film follows Anvil , half with original members and half with new ones , as they first go on tour in Europe ( while on vacation from their actual pay jobs , which include for Lips driving grocery supplies - again , a supermarket job ala Randy The Ram Robinson and breaking concrete for Reiner ) , and after the initial high of going on tour in Metal havens like Sweden find that their manager is misguided and without proper English and they barely get paid for gigs they actually play . Then when they get back it sets in that they don't really play anywhere and are deteriorating away - until the initiative comes to Legs that an album must be made , and their only real big-time major produced record , produced by the guy behind many of Black Sabbath and Thin Lizzy's records , tries to get them to do it . But there's money problems . There's internal strife . There's getting the record actually distributed . There's getting gigs . In scenes that are both weirdly , awkwardly funny and as sad as a burning orphan we see Lips on camera talking about how much this new record will be great even if it doesn't sell much at all , or how they've stuck together through thick and thin . If you never met the man you might think the band is a joke , but the brilliance of the filmmaker behind it - big-time Anvil fan Sascha Gervasi - is to get us as close to these people , with real families that have mixed feelings about their husband's or son's or brother's career choices ( or lack thereof ) as honestly as possible . There's even a couple of moments where mortality and longevity are given immediacy and depth , so much so I could only think of last year's Young @ Heart at topping it . Aside from it being gripping documentary work and a fine , dark and often slyly funny look at the triumph of the spirit of these guys ( we even get as the finale , as with Tap , a big quasi-comeback concert in Japan , only here with the potential to bring some in the audience to tears ) , it's a sensational metal movie . These guys are legends to other guys like Slash and Lemmy and Lars Ulrich for a reason - they are that greatest - metal - band - you - never - heard of , loaded with energy and craziness ( one of Lips trademarks was using a dildo to play his guitar on stage ) and the verve that at the least gets attention . If you're at all a metal fan or admirer and don't know them before seeing it , as was the case with myself , you'll want to track down their albums and see what they got to offer . They got the right stuff , and the movie is a testament to their gifts at being a fantastic " old-school " metal band and being the sort of tenacious human beings that get people rooting for them every step of the way . As the line goes from the Wrestler : the only place I get hurt is " out there " ( points to outside world ) .
510354	453068	100873	10.0	a vibrant , strange , and completely absorbing look at the strife and creation of two brothers	Robert Altman makes one of the great films about artistic expression , the utter and complete frustration with it , the dregs of having to go through the motions in a capitalistic society where taste is so subjective that it combs over the fact that an artist needs some recognition . We never see Vincent Van Gogh , via equally frustrated ( though nowhere near as insane ) brother Theo , sell any of his work , and it doesn't help things that as things get more and more desperate , and funds dry up and mental disintegration kicks in , Vincent just starts to snap or look like he'll snap any minute . It's a powerful film not because so much of the full-on drive of the plot , as Altman is infamous for making that the secondary characteristic ( if at all ) of his films , but for the camaraderie of two brothers , of the very intense push-and-pull between the two of them . It also helps that Altman has three very crucial and , ultimately , exquisitely successful assets . First are his two main actors , Tim Roth and Paul Rhys . Both actors make up the brothers as having a similar temperament : anxiety brushed over by a quiet , isolated mind-set . But as brothers , the two of them act them as two far reaching personalities that somehow come back to the other through some form of need . That , in a way , is a subtext to much of what happens to either brother , of a need of acceptance never reached , either through financial gain or reputation , or just through some semblance of sanity or reason for being with the opposite sex . Rhys is perfect as an uptight , shy , but also very conflicted - sexually and sort of existentially - about what to do with his life , and with his poor brother . He has that look in his eyes like he's a solid individual , but seething underneath is rage and discontent , despite his best efforts . He pulls off this emotive being quite well , even if dipping a little into over-acting at times ( he might seem to yell every other scene ) . Roth , meanwhile , gives one of his crowning achievements as an actor , worthy of Pacino . When he's not going totally ape-s in throwing stuff on the ground or painting his or another's face or doing the token ear cutting scene ( it's only a lobe , by the way , sorry to disappoint ) , he seems to be perfectly still with a calm voice , but eyes darting much of the time around . Roth makes Van Gogh less a caricature and more a full-bodied being , as far as can be in an Altman film this understanding of the nature of an artist of the period . You're never sure when he might suddenly snap back , and its equally tense and compelling to see Roth in the scenes of Van Gogh painting , in a field of flowers giving up or when he's transfixed in the act of creating when drawing the prostitute when she's not paying attention . This leads to the second asset , which is Stephen Altman's production design , where nothing is left to the imagination . This , in a way , allows for an almost surreal feeling underneath the veneer of the straightforward . It looks all as if it's shot on location ; even the paintings look like they were on loan from the big galleries of the world . And the third asset is Altman himself , though more over his trust in the material . One might wonder what Altman made his own of the script or what was already there . But it seems very much a move from the director to see how the film opens , which is odd and interesting , as footage from an auction where a Van Gogh fetches tens of millions of dollars goes on , with the audio transposed as if it were on some radio somewhere that doesn't exist in the background during the first scene with the brothers where they argue about money and painting and going to Paris . Throughout Altman is always assured with the lens , allowing his actors total freedom , and in this he evens gets creative as his main subject : watch the scene with Van Gogh in the field of dandelions , as his camera starts to do the small zooms and pans with the surroundings , as opposed to just the actor ( this also goes for when Vincent and his first lady are in the gallery with the long landscape portrait that at first looks like a shot out of Antonioni ) . And Altman never goes for easy or cheesy stylizations when it comes to Vincent going off the deep end - we're given a look at it all as if it's so very simple , which makes it even more effective for his intents and purposes . A tale that acts as a slight cautionary tale for aspiring artists , while also probing a mind so delirious and brilliant that it acts as a tale that offers up many interpretations psychologically and historically , Vincent & Theo is ultimately worthwhile for its collection of superlative scenes , of passion running through even in the smaller moments between characters . And the musical score is affecting as well - think a baroque duet with one side a punk rocker .
508608	453068	39631	10.0	a black comedy of manners ; stunning performance from Chaplin	It would be hard to imagine anyone else playing Monsieur Verdoux ; Charlie Chaplin was the only one who could pull it off in any form or style or way that wouldn't make the character as just an unlikeable killer of women . As it's written on the page the character , if played by someone with less charisma or charm or comic timing , would just be another character actor playing a villain . But Chaplin taking the part is inspired on his part , and it's a good thing too ( and I never thought I'd say this ) that he didn't let Orson Welles direct . With Welles it obviously would have been a visually awesome picture , but would the comedy be the same ? Or the emphasis on the social message blending in with the ultimate sanctimonious attitude of the character ? It would be interesting to see Welles script , if it exists , but as it stands he's mostly a footnote in his tale , if a thankful one . Under Chaplin's direction and writing Monsieur Verdoux is timed with finesse and glee and with a repetitive transition of the train going by quickly with Chaplin's piano key strokes , and it's often devilish fun to hear how Chaplin's Verdoux gets around and about ( or sometimes not ) killing and robbing his victims . And yet , I'm inclined to say that it's above all else a triumph for Chaplin as an actor , a performer who's iconic appeal , even past the Tramp character , makes us ( or at least me ) almost cheer him on or feel awkward or cringing during a scene leading up to a murder , or , as does happen once or twice , not . He knows how to put on an air that's genuine , even as it's the most blatant con , and he does it with a gentleman's manner hiding his desperate - times - call - for - desperate - measures ex-bank clerk . While I wouldn't go as far as James Agee in calling it the greatest male performance ever , it might just be my favorite Chaplin performance , full of ranging subtleties and over-the-top expressions and just lingering looks of contempt and malaise and sorrow and outright lying and etc that are just a knockout . Monsier Verdoux is a peculiar character , as his crimes are meant to be for the good of his wife and child who , of course , have no idea of what he's really doing ( in an acidic touch , his wife is also crippled ) . Is it wrong what he's doing ? In the legal sense , of course . But Chaplin sets up a moral code for this character that makes things trickier , a little warped in thinking . If the woman has lots of wealth stored away - and maybe , as with the one who keeps getting away via wine glass and fishing trip , almost deserving in the perception of the character - why carp ? But then there's the woman who's just out of prison , her husband's gone , nothing to her name , and . . . he just can't bear to do her in ( especially , as should be noted , as a " test " run for another victim ) . It becomes curious to see her later on , sort of as the not-quite Chaplin heroine of the story , and how saving the right one for Verdoux is what counts , despite forgetting her until she reappears . So there's this twisted logic , but in the set-pieces that Chaplin sets up are some of the finest , most brilliantly timed comic moments of his career , filmed for a dark suspense tinged with a near sweetness that we know and love from him . It's satire on a level that is no more or less sophisticated than Chaplin's major silent works , and yet it's just a little sharper , more pointed at the ills of man in turmoil than a simple psychopath , all in the realm of delightful crimes in the upper class . While the end may seem derivative of the Great Dictator with a speech and message chocked forward like spray-paint on a wall , it's a mixed reaction one might have ; the sanctimonious attitude , of being accepting and pointing the finger back on society , is haunting and obvious and also , importantly , speaks to the nature of the character . Would a man somewhat comfortable in his own mortality face the end any other way ?
509992	453068	96219	10.0	Still one of Oliver Stone's directorial triumphs ; Bogosian is captivating	In one of the more under-seen films of the late 1980's , at a time when Oliver Stone was riding high with Platoon and Wall Street ( and before his opus Born on the Fourth of July ) , he co-scripted and directed this look at the world of radio , specifically one radio host in the middle of Texas . This man is Barry Champlain , in a once-in-a-career turn from Eric Bogosian , who wrote the original play and also co-wrote the script . Barry is like a mix of Howard Stern and one of those pundits you hear on the radio stations many of us might turn off . He's got ideas on his mind , opinions , and he's not only un-afraid to speak them , but also to stand up against the phone callers . The callers , indeed , are the driving force in the film , as Barry has to combat against the mindless , the obscene , the racist , and the purely absent-minded . As this goes on , he also has to contend with his boss ( Alec Baldwin ) and a hit or miss deal to go nationwide , outside the confines of the Southern way station he's in . While after seeing the film I felt curious as to see how it would've been done on stage ( I'd imagine it was a one-man show , as Bogosian has had several on the side ) , the direction of the film is phenomenal . Stone has been known , almost typecast , as a director who loves quick cuts , the limitless effects of montage , and effects with the styles of camera-work and other little tricks , that give his films in the 90's a distinctive , almost auteur look . But in the 80's he had this energy and feverish quality to the look of the film , and wasn't as frenzied as the other films . In order to add the proper intensity that is within the studio and head-space of Barry Champlain , he and DP Robert Richardson make the space seem claustrophobic at times , gritty , un-sure , and definitely on edge . The scenes in the middle of the film , when Barry isn't in the studio , are fairly standard , but the style along with the substance in the radio scenes is among the best I've seen from the Stone / Richardson combination . And one cannot miscalculate the performance of Bogosian , who can be obnoxious , offensive , angered , passive , and everything that we love and hate in radio show hosts . There is also a funny , near distracting supporting role for Michael Wincott as Kent / Michael / Joe , who prank calls him one night , and the next gets invited to the studio . These scenes are a little uncomfortable for a viewer , but it does get very much into the subculture head-space of the 80's that Barry is as intrigued as he is critical of . The stoner may not ' get it ' , but as he says to him " it's your show " . Indeed , it's hard to cover everything that goes on within the talk , and there is a lot of it . But it's never boring , and like Champlain himself , it's not easy to ignore . And when Bogosian goes into his climactic tirade on air , with the background panning around in a continuous 360 spin , it becomes intoxicating , and a reason why freedom of speech is so powerful . Stone has been synonymous as a filmmaker of hot-button issues , who takes on subjects that were or still are controversial , and gives them a life-force that isn't always great , but is all his own . Here his skills and ambitions don't get in the way of Bogosian's - it's boosted , if anything , making an extremely skilled vision of what is essentially a near one-man show , which in and of itself is already well-written .
510134	453068	364569	10.0	a revenge picture that isn't very pretty , and loves it that way	Oldboy was a film I saw twice in the theater , in New York City ( the second time not totally intentional , just the only thing playing worth seeing ) , and saw again recently . I'm still struck on how balls-to-the-wall director Chanwook Park goes with his story . It's actually not a bad story , but it needs a certain push and originality in drive to make it work . For some this will be overkill , and it's not without an argument . The film is violent , though perhaps not on the level of Fukasaku or Miike's films . It's disturbing , but in a way that hits deep by way of raw emotions that can only come out of East Asian cinema . And it has a level of drama that's staggering , maybe for some a little far-fetched . But it's also a good lot of the time a bitingly funny film , loaded with attitude to match its style , but with a heart as well . The small low-down on the story : Oh Dae-su ( Choi Min-Sik in a towering performance worthy of Charles Bronson or Harvey Keitel or both ) is nabbed un-wittingly and thrown into a prison . We follow him along in his long stint , seeming forever , until he suddenly gets ' released ' into the open . Now it's time for revenge , but is the question of the truth , of the why , even more crucial than actually getting payback ? This becomes the main dramatic pull of Oldboy , but it's not just a kind of ultra-violent fight and action filled epic saga . It's also a love story , so to speak , and a film about the mistakes of youth . The antagonist of the story , Lee Woo-Jin ( Yu Ji-Tae in what is one of the most absorbing and calmly demented performances in recent memory ) , becomes a very threatening , dark presence in the film , omnipresent a lot of the time , like a devil watching over it's subject . And when it comes to the climax , there is a level of Greek tragedy that's so strong , it had a good few in the theater I saw the film clinging tenaciously to their seats . The story , admittedly , is relatively thin when one thinks about it , and if a director wanted to pull a Howard Hawks and cut past all of the modern aesthetic the film would be a third less in length . But the twisted pleasure of watching a film like Oldboy unfold is in the manipulation of the style , how Park and his director of photography Jeong Jeong-hung give the film an indie wham-bang zeal while at the same time following no rules . This is demonstrated in many tense scenes , but the memorable ones include at least a few key moments in Oh Dae-Su's prison cell , and particularly the infamous long-shot as the fight breaks out in the prison hallway . Seeing a scene like this may or may not draw some viewers down the line right away ; how much can you take seeing a scene lasting 3 or 4 or more minutes of just brutal beating , choreographed to a full intensity ? As with the film in general , it's a not-too guilty pleasure for genre fans , and for others they might watch it and think ' eh ' . But it is also in the people , in the characters that creates a heightened pitch in Oldboy . It's like a filmed graphic novel in some ways , but dealing with characters who ( possible exceptions being Lee Woo Jin and some of his ' posse ' ) are not part of a criminal underworld , and our main hero is turned inside out , into what he calls as himself a ' monster ' ( watch for the reference to Frankenstein on TV , by the way ) . So , when it comes time for this harsh , piercing revelation scene in the high tower Lee occupies , it leads to some devastating stuff . Like the darkest bits out of Sophocles , Park's characters are practically doomed by fate , and it's not much of a picnic for them getting there . But for the audience , it's created as a post-modern stew . Oldboy is rough , taut , and in spurts quite visionary .
508872	453068	56869	10.0	both absurd and completely terrifying , a film of massive intelligence and enthrallment	What a repeat viewing will bring : The Birds is Alfred Hitchcock's blockbuster entertainment that somehow can appeal to the " art-house " movie-goers as well . Meaning that even more than with Psycho , and certainly on a much grander and ambitious palette than North by Northwest , we have Hitchcock the grand ol ' Master of Suspense for his mainstream fans , and at the same time gives an appeal to those who might consider themselves too high-minded to be considered part of the ' mainstream ' . Meaning if you're in a coffee shop and on one end there's a group of teenagers and on the other end a couple of middle-aged psycho-therapists with numerous degrees , they could both be talking with similar depth & / or enthusiasm over the Birds . It's a work where the story gets set up very well : Tippi Hedren as the daughter of a high-ranking official ( maybe a few brain cells and style-wise above Paris Hilton ) in San Francisco who wants to get to know better a man , Mitch , who's from an island off the coast . She follows him down to the island only to be confronted by Mitch's mother ( Jessica Tandy ) as well as his sister . It's a little uncomfortable a situation in the sort of mother-son dynamic she rattles . . . but that's not all her presence seems to be incurring . What unravels from there is sheer Hitchcock exploitation film-making - exploiting the audience's wildest fears - always with the most assured and inventiveness that one would expect . Several shots stick in one's memory , perhaps the greatest being the from-the-sky view of the fire that breaks out in the city , and then the seagulls that come into the foreground ( point of view is put into question here , and it's a shot that works on both levels as mentioned before ) . As for the average horror fan , The Birds may work even more effectively than Psycho , despite its age shown in the bird attack scenes - which are nevertheless extraordinary in the usage of composite shots - because after the initial shock of the middle chunk of the film Hitchcock gets into something of a near zombie movie in the last third of the picture . Mitch barricades his mother , sister and Melanie in the house , only to have the rancor-loaded birds crashing head on to get at the house . Getting at what , who's to say ? There's explanations that can be given , to be sure , but it may not even be necessary , it just is ( one gets this amusingly from Hitchcock via the scene in the restaurant / bar with the town locals giving their drunken / angered / well-informed viewpoints ) . When it comes down to it , The Birds is not entirely as emotionally disturbing or complex as Vertigo , and one might be reluctant to say that it is art because of its appeal on a commercial level . But art it is , conjured out of a premise that seems ridiculous yet made all the more prescient and startling through Hitchcock's ever-careful style , and specifically the lack of a traditional Herrmann musical score ( albeit with his contribution as a sound-designer with the birds notwithstanding ) . By the last scene , one sees how what might have been a cheesy , trashy work by a lesser filmmaker out for cheap scares , becomes something of a bizarre , discomforting statement on nature versus human beings , or at least what can be capable of those we all take for granted . It's also a hell of a lot of fun for the whole family , more or less ; watch for the school-yard singing as the birds swarm around the playground , later parodied wonderfully in High Anxiety .
510376	453068	43274	10.0	one of only several films from Disney that work very well for totally different crowds	Alice in Wonderland is , as well as what the one-line summary suggests , is one of the more abstracted kind of animated films the Disney studio has ever released . And it needs this edge for what the material requires . Here is a film that means different times throughout a life , for some people . As a kid it's a wondrous , madcap adventure with as much sincerity and polite little moments with Alice as it contains vision after vision where varied forms of caricatured anarchy and odd transformations guised as fables . As an older teen , it comes off more as seeming like a ' drug ' movie , and of course Carroll's original story has become not just a phrase for ' through the looking glass ' in society , but as part of metaphors for the drug community ( " White Rabbit " is one of those classic , strange 60's songs that still works today ) . With various allusions to such substances like the big-and-small pills , the caterpillar with the pipe , the hare and hatter with their ' tea ' , and the Cheshire Cat going in through the out door , it's not too hard to picture it as being a precursor to the 60s . But , of course , there is also that very innocent approach that the Disney films had of that early period . Alice is as innocent and day-dreaming as Snow White , though with a little more interest due to her having to be a formidable enough guide through this imaginative world . And there are little , surreal fables that are laced in that , again , capture the absurd poetic tone of Carroll's work . The segment with the Walrus and the Carpenter is a very good example of this , and is one of the funniest segments not only of the film but maybe of any Disney feature of the period . And stretching out after going into taking the ideas and images from the book into animated form , the abstractions become rather incredible for their time . As a kid as well as now I loved seeing the large Alice start to cry to the point of creating a dangerous sea of it right by the snobbish doorknob . The Cheshire Cat is one of those insane concoctions that is delightful in its unhinged abandon . The Queen of Hearts sequences towards the end are , for me , the only ones that are more closer to the ' traditional ' Disney films where the looser , crazier nature that went on before with the March Hare and Mad Hatter took place ( one of my all-time favorite Disney scenes by the way - that little mouse deserved some sort of prize ) . Overall , this is quite a treat to revisit years later - yes , even in a non-induced kind of state - with cheerful songs , and a neat balance of delirious humor and silly imagination . In short , a film like this probably couldn't be made today , at least by Disney .
509938	453068	82971	10.0	Classic B film revitalized ; was worth seeing again after so many years	I hadn't seen Steven Spielberg / George Lucas's first collaboration , Raiders of the Lost ark , since I was quite young . When I saw it again today , I got a bit of a different perspective , in that I've now come to watch it again after seeing film after film after film that has been either inspired by it , or just plain ripped it off . Though it's not to say that this film doesn't borrow from every cliffhanger , matinée serial ever created . It's got Harrison Ford in the role that's made him an icon - perhaps even further than Han Solo for some - as the hard-as-nails archaeologist with only one or two minor ( so to speak ) fears . The story is there , but it's really the clothes hanger for Spielberg to race along Jones on his quest for the Lost Ark of the title , where Nazi's get in the way , as well as every ' trick in the book ' of the action / adventure genre . One could argue , and it has been , that it's almost too much , and that the sequels are improvements . But this still retains the power of Spielberg's best work , not to mention Lucas at his most amusing and terrifying . At the least , it was worth it to watch again to get a big laugh out of the dancing-then-one-shot scene ( you know which one I mean ) .
508142	453068	47136	10.0	one of my favorite westerns	Nicholas Ray , one of those rare directors who could put in a style or outlook of his own in various films of different conventional types in 1950's Hollywood , has with his film Johnny Guitar a job very well done . I had the chance to see it on the big screen at a revival screening some months ago ( mostly among Joan Crawford fans ) on a double bill with Sam Fuller's Forty Guns . Crawford , McCambridge , and definitely Sterling Hayden ( one of my all-time favorite ' guy ' actors ) brought a lot to the entertainment factor of the film . The story goes like this ( and if you've seen Sergio Leone's Once Upom a Time in the West , you'll notice obvious similarities , as his was a slight homage of this film ) - Crawford owns a bar / parlor on the edge of town . The townspeople want her out to make way for a railroad , most vocally of this is McCambridge ( in maybe the best performance of the film , really the most theatrical ) . The title character is played with usual panache by Hayden , who at first is a little enigmatic , then reveals himself to have a past with Crawford . The story then unravels from there , in a way that actually went against my expectations , much to my delight . This is the kind of genre picture that knows what it is , but with a director clever enough to take chances . For example , there is the contrast of color between Crawford and the angry townspeople near the beginning of the film . She's playing the piano on one side of the room in a white dress , while the others , the supposedly ' good ' people of the town , are all in black . Is Ray messing with the convention of good guys white , bad guys black , or do we have to keep attentive all the way through to know how it plays out ? I think you'd have to - this is one of those westerns that has enough excitement , humor ( mostly dark or unintentional ) , and a climax that goes with some of the best of them . At the least it should hold up for those expecting something very dated - it's not quite as towering as the Leone films , but on its own terms Ray has a contender against all those old-school Ford / Wayne westerns .
508668	453068	29870	10.0	more than 70 years old and , with a couple of big exceptions , hasn't aged a day	Michael Curtiz's Angels with Dirty Faces can be considered a full-blooded , no-holds-barred genre classic for a few reasons . One of it is how well he depicts the " hero " worship of street-tough kids who look up to the next generation of super street-tough and street-wise hoodlums . The Dead End Kids - an actual gang of sorts who acted in this and another movie - look to James Cagney's Rocky Sullivan since , first and foremost , he came out of the neighborhood and the very building that they hang out of ( the initials , along with those of Sullivan's boyhood friend turned Priest Jerry , are carved on the wall ) . But also there's the persona of Rocky Sullivan , a guy who wont take no s off of cops OR the criminals , and will do things his way or a highway burned to a crisp . And , perhaps underneath this , for all of the ruthless things that Rocky Sullivan does , he's honest . There's a genuine quality to him while he occasionally lies , cheats , steals , whatever as a 1930s era gangster is want to do . This is what makes it extra powerful then when , right before he's sent to the electric chair , the Priest asks him to lie outright and act like he turned yellow for the Dead End Kids and others to see how he turned out . Apparently there's another version of this ending where this didn't happen , and oddly enough I prefer the version I saw with the turning yellow . This is not just because of Cagney's performance , which already up until now is just about legendary in proportion . There's an underlying message with it being the priest that asks this of him . Now , part of this has to do with them being friends and that there's this trust between them . But there's also the fact that it's a priest , a man of the cloth , using God and his will and life-after-death as a means to get some scaring back into the kids as opposed to the usual hero worship . It doesn't matter that the kids aren't told the truth , but that Jerry will know that it wasn't true , but puts up the front anyway . This is a classic ending that works on multiple levels . Speaking of Cagney , there's no way one can say they are a fan of the star without checking this out . Here is one of the quintessential performances of all time in ANY gangster or crime picture . This lends itself , of course , to the fact that Rocky Sullivan is such an interesting character as the dark half of the face that was Rocky and Jerry as kids ( one could see a similar split take shape in an underlying or existential sense in Scorsese's movies of this ilk ) . But it's Cagney that imbues it with real guts and tenacity ; he knows this guy so well that he doesn't have to break a sweat at doing a big dramatic scene , such as the big shoot-out at the end , or even in the smaller scenes where he doesn't take lip from Bogart ( also in very fine form , seeing two giants face off is an added bonus ) where little facial markers and moments make it so memorable . He's a natural at this because simply he sets the pacing just right for the scene and rolls with it to the logical end . One can see process being worked out right on the screen but with the seemingly effortless grace of a class act . It's also , I should also add , a very cool story , one that even as it's set in the late 1930s loses little of its resonance for today ; a story like this could just as easily be shot in the same environment as say the City of God underworld in Rio , where one rises up through the ranks with some ferocity and also a little help from crooked cops or politicians , and then the next generation already lining up , and one or two good apples in the bunch . Oh , and it's got very fast and cutting action scenes , which never hurts when done right .
509700	453068	765443	10.0	deep in rich characterizations , unpretentious in style , perfect performances , one of the year's best !	David Cronenberg's Eastern Promises takes on , in the broadest stroke , the Russian mafia . But it's not that broad , per-say , so much as it takes on the atmosphere of an organized crime family , of the terror that is just completely seething under the surface , and comes up like pus out of a boil when heated . The Russian underworld of London isn't too pretty , and rivalries are settled often with the slice of a throat by a shaving knife ( as happens towards the beginning of the film , and later on in a graveyard , put to a splendid jump-cut to an accordion player ) , with the members initiated through specific tattoos on the torso and knees . And when the most unexpected happens , like a terrible rape / pregnancy / birth via a 14 year old girl , the repercussions could be even more severe than a murder rap . I loved getting immersed into the nature of the people , of the violence , the threat of it , the joys submerged with lots and lots of vodka ( it could be a stereotype , but then what would a stereotype be if it weren't true in the ugliest form ) , and at the same time always outsiders to British society . It's an insulated world , where double-edged personalities are common , especially if a crime boss / father like Armin Mueller-Stahl's character Semyon and at one time he has to be kind and compassionate to those outside of the circle . Like Naomi Watts's midwife character , who first comes to him about this mystery baby and a girl's diary written in Russian . But there's always the sensation , even early on , that he's a lot more sinister , a lot more cruel and vicious than he would let on to any " ordinary " person , and this is all the more apparent in his quick outbursts against his son Kirill ( Vincent Cassell ) . Kirill , of course , is like a lone black sheep of the family , who gets into trouble with other families , usually through killing somebody in all late hours of the night . Nikolai ( Mortensen ) is the driver / bodyguard / foot-soldier to Kirill and the rest of the family , and has a bond that goes beyond what Kirill has - he's really like a ' good ' son , if anything at all , to Seymon . Some of the best scenes in any Cronenberg film are those that are filled with an unspoken tension , and understanding of the dynamics , when Nikolai settles a situation between Seymon and Kirill , or those subdued homo-erotic moments from Kirill to Nikolai . Many of those scenes , the whole story arc of Nikolai , is a truly compelling tale that soon reveals itself - and not to reveal too much here as to make it spoiling - as part of Cronenberg's aesthetic of the double-sided nature of a man , or the duality inherent in certain types . But suffice to say , it's one of the coolest examples , even if it might seem almost conventional at first , because of what Nikolai's future will come to following the fight he has in the steam-house . While we see the more emotional story of Anna who , like Nikolai , is an outsider who is put into a somewhat torn situation ( albeit Nikolai , unlike Anna , is far more cunning , and as he says to her at one point he is a ' bad ' guy ) , her side of the story is more of something to keep things moving along - the fate of the diary , the baby , the whole ball of wax of secrets surrounding the mother's death and so on . This is all still compelling , in sad voice-overs , but somehow Anna's side is more of a base-line to the saga of the Russian family , which is appropriate . Her ending , which seems tidied up on the surface , has an open-ending that feels almost TOO tidy - however if you're thinking that ambiguity is lacking , it actually nears up to what History of Violence offered in a ' what next ' kind of query to the audience . As modern thrillers should be , as Cronenberg and his screenwriter knows , Eastern Promises is efficient , startling , and often as entertaining as the goofiest moments of any film by the director . Only here its in little moments of dialog ( was Anna's uncle in the KGB . . . maybe not , but as an auxiliary ? ) , not so much in outrageousness or super-gore . And yet it's also probably even more violent , if only in the suddenness , than History of Violence ; the much hyped steam-room right with Mortensen fending off the two gangsters lives up to it , as it's as visceral as Oldboy's classic sequence , and with an energy and shock value that made everyone in the audience I saw it with yelp and cringe . But Cronenberg isn't simply going by shock value here - Eastern Promises is very strong as classic storytelling , and even better in the acting department . Mortensen is one of Cronenberg's very best male collaborator / stars , and here his work is , if anything , more subtle and textured than the last one ( which is saying a lot of both director and actor ) ; Mueller-Stahl gives maybe his best performance since the 80s , a sure Oscar contender if I've ever seen one ; Watts is sublime in a role that requires her mostly to be uneasy around Russian mobsters and frightened by the fear all around the situation ; Cassell is about as taut as can be imaginable , and at the same time projecting the pathetic subtext to Kirill's boasting masculinity and stupidity . If you're planning on seeing any crime movie this year - that isn't directed by the Coen brothers - and one that is atmospheric without hyper-stylization , and grips the intellect just as much as the emotions , Eastern Promises is it . In a career of some of the most challenging probes of men on the edge of sanity and / or reason , Cronenberg continues to strike where the iron is hot , or just not seen to even be considered grounds for striking at all .
508779	453068	1227926	10.0	possibly the single funniest thing I've seen from Whedon . . .	. . . I say this though as a quasi-Whedon ignorant ; I've only seen about two seasons worth of Buffy , no Angel , and all of Firefly and Serenity . Joss Whedon's sense of humor is playful , crude , warped , and everything one might love from a skewering of superheroes . Hancock , take note , this is how it's done with consistency ! The premise of Dr . Horrible can be summed up in one sentence : Boy ( Dr . Horrible ) with nerdy powers finds and wants girl , boy loses girl to arch nemesis boy Captain Hammer , boy plots revenge , boy finds things end on a pretty bitter and sad note . Or , to put it another way , it's about the nerdy guy wanting the girl and the beefy upstart with an ego the size of a blimp is hogging her for himself . That's the gist of it , anyway , but to say this is all Dr . Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is about is to do a total disservice to Whedon and his large fan-base . This is a musical not quite unlike the Buffy classic " Once More , with Feeling " only without that pesky ' you have to know a and b and c are going on in the series and season ' logic . One is thrust into that sharp , laconic , and joyously obvious sense of humor that reveals Whedon as someone who is a kind of curious master of musical comedy with those appropriate doses of barbed satire . At the same time , as one who may have watched their share of Buffy and even Firefly knows , Whedon is also a hopeless romantic ( hopeless in that he can't seem to put people together without something going wrong , which is the point of all drama one supposes ) , and his tale of Dr . Horrible , done through songs that reveal the characters ' souls , heartfelt and adorable and totally meat-headed ( the Captain's final song at the podium with his award is next to Godliness ) , and at the same time a cheap joke ( random cowboys singing along from the sides of the frame ) or a catchy number ( the " Man's gotta do " song is far more wondrous than about 99 . 9 % of stuff on the radio now ) isn't sacrificed for the sake of what little plot there is . And lest not forget the acting , or at least the awesome musical prowess . Neal Patrick Harris and Nathan Filion are just about perfect in their roles , as is the woman who plays Penny ( the red-headed girl Dr . Horrible meets at the Coin Mart ) , with Filion especially juicy in a somewhat campy turn where he takes all those heroic qualities of his Firefly character and reveals the dark side ( " And yes , we had sex " ) . Dr . Horrible's Sing-along Blog is about as close to romantic - comedy - musical - satire amazement as one could hope for , or maybe not expect , from Whedon , particularly as a free web-series running just about the length of a full short film ( or an extremely short feature ) .
510461	453068	78446	10.0	Still the most superb and funny drug film ever	You notice how Ebert has his great movies section in his site , well if I was to have a section like that , this would be the first film to put in it ( among a couple of dozen though , so don't be nervous ) . While of course there are other great drug films : Traffic ( which deserved best picture ) , Boogie Nights , GoodFellas ( which even though is my # 1 is in many other genres ) , Half Baked , Blow , and any other Cheech and Chong movie other than The Corsican Brothers . But this one gets on the top of my list by just telling it straight . While of course some is exaggerated for comedy , C & C represent the average Joe who wants some dope and has trouble usually getting it around town ( unlike say Half Baked , which was a little unrealistic in that they were hallucinating and always getting pot . Richard " Cheech " Marin and Thomas " Tommy " Chong in the 70's made many funny albums , and this was they're first movie . And within the first 15 minutes of the movie is classic comedy cinema , truly a contender with such moments as the Woody Allen Gub or the Springtime for Hitler scene in The Producers . In these minutes , the two ( Cheech playing his character Pedro and Chong playing his character Man Stoner from the famous albums ) meet by a hitch-hiking feat and when Chong pulls out a monster joint and the two smoke it ( followed by Cheech eating so much acid he would be out for a month ) , the two become best friends . The following then in the movie contains various segments of how they try and get grass from a crazed Vietnam Vet , in Mexico , and other places . Along the way they are hunted by a police sergeant ( Stacy Keach , who would give one of the 80's best comedic performances in Nice Dreams ) , and get mixed up in a punk band . And don't forget the Ajax lady who makes Martini in Cukoo's nest look normal . Overall , the film is a triumph of the American comedy , but it also has some deep meaning ( some you might only be able to find when you start to light up , but hey ) . The 70's were a time when people were snorting coke , going to discos , getting the Aids , etc . But what a change of pace to see 2 goofy yet very optimistic guys going about as they probably would in real life in that time getting grass and playing music . One of the most outstanding 70's films and comedies .
510382	453068	64873	10.0	one of the sleepers of the late sixties , with ( good ) experimental ideals for a drama	In some scenes in the Rain People , Francis Ford Coppola's precursor to his hey-day of the seventies , there is the mark of a similar situation to 1969's Easy Rider , but not exactly in the same reference frame . Here we have a drama about disconnected people from society , in some ways alienated by the choices or by limits imposed by one mean or another . It's one of those rare original dramas where some scenes stand alone as total knockouts . Even with such a low-string budget and a very freewheeling , so to speak , attitude about filming the movie , Coppola is able to capture everything that needs to be said through these clearly defined characters and the curved , unexpected degrees of one character versus the helplessness of another , or vice versa , or both . And , as one might be inclined seeing as how it is very much about the cutaways of suburban life of the 1960s , it has that escapism of the film mentioned before , but of a more concrete , near timeless quality with the drama and the underlying issues . In a way , if Bergman were on route as a quasi-guerrilla 20-something filmmaker out to get the strange truths of everyday outsiders , this might be it . But along with all of the very direct and sometimes self-conscious photography ( though also with a more documentary approach at times , akin with its indeterminable characters ) , the actors all fit into place . Shirley Knight , an actress I'm not too familiar with , has a complex , diverging role as a pregnant wife running off in a sort of existentialist conundrum of what life is there to have . There are moments of some awe-inspiring acting by her , and one of my favorites ( if not my favorite ) is when she is on the telephone calling her husband the first time . Such a tense scene on both ends , and in every small gesture and inflection of a word so much about her is spoken with so little . It's extraordinary in ways that mirror others in Coppola's films . Then comes in the character of ' killer ' played by James Caan . This , too , is a dangerous character to take on , as it is a mix of childish bewilderment and amusement with scarred memories . Think Forrest Gump if he didn't make it past the football and wit . It's one of his best , actually , by being the most minimalist - for a guy who's usually playing tough guys in movies , here's one that also is part of the crux of the story and of Knight's character . Also very good in a supporting role is Robert Duvall as a cop with a rough side and rather checkered past ; kind of an early sample of other defected characters he would play later on in his career . So the characters , and what Coppola risks in having an uneasiness running in them , are really what make up the film , as whatever story there is it is definitely not resolved in the usual way you might think or expect . The last ten or so minutes are like others in Coppola's work , where the specific tragedies on all sides are undercut by the emotional - and psychological - implications this will leave on the principles are amplified to the sublime and sad . This is , for its time , brave on the part of what is trying to be represented ( in both the freedom as well as the flaws and ambiguities ) in the subject matter . And the style of the picture adds a fragmented kind of view onto it all with quick flashbacks that are graphic and self-contained in a contrast with the longer shots in some crucial scenes . It's a road movie of its period , but its also got a lot more working than it would under another filmmaker with less chances to take on the nature of these outcast characters . One of the best films of 1969 .
509563	453068	87193	10.0	If ever there was a way to spend 72 minutes with Bergman , it's here	Fanny and Alexander , to Ingmar Bergman , IS his last released film , written and directed by him . But this film , which was originally meant only for Swedish television , found its way to the USA and abroad , and ( excluding Saraband , which was a film that just had to be made by its maker ) is a welcome piece of theater , about the theater . After the Rehearsal is a short , but extremely satisfying take on what it means to be a director , and what it means to act , or to just be in the profession of the imitation of life . Bergman gives us only three actors ( two kids , who pop up only for a few moments , one of which the child who wonderfully played Alexander in the above title , is one of them ) , and all that happens is talk , and talk . To one who may not be familiar well with Bergman , it may not be wise to go immediately to this film . That is , unless one is very much in love with the theater . The filmmaker , who was also a major producer and director of countless theatrical production , is able to suffuse his personal views , good and bad , on the process , or the lack thereof . Interesting too is how his lead male , Henrik ( Erland Josephsson , one of Bergman's most recognizable and accessible talents ) , has a conversation not just with an aspiring actress ( Lena Olin ) , but also his ex-wife ( Ingrid Thulin , also one of the magnificent women from Bergman's repertory company ) , to explore his past and present difficulties . There is so much that Bergman brings to the table to discuss about the theater in this film , and in such a short running time , that it might be moot to delve very far into his what certain things may or may not ' mean ' . Like many of the director's films , it's dramatic structure that tries to get behind the surfaces of what lies in seemingly one or two-sided characters . Henrik , at times , is given voice-over narration where he questions what he's saying , sometimes in anger or despair , to this young actress . Or , when his love ( Thulin ) is shown to be somewhat compassionate even as she seems a little crazed or , in fact , lonely . As Henrik and his pupil talk ( not rehearse , of course ) about why they are there , it becomes strikingly existential even when it's not meant to be . Olin is brilliant in the opposing side of Josephsson's often calm but boiling persona , as she tries to figure out what it is this director wants out of her . When it comes down to it , Bergman is not only asking questions about the theater and the people in it , but also about human nature in its role of the theater . While this could sound like subject matter to scare or ( worse ) bore away some viewers , if you give the film enough patience for the 72 minutes ( that seem to fill each minute with enough substance for an average work twice its length ) , it serves its purpose well enough to not be disregarded as an important later work in Bergman's career . And , by the way , if you're young ( i . e . under 17 ) and have some reason to want to check this out , don't let the R rating deter you ; it's one of the most un-necessarily R-rated films ever ( for a brief flash of nudity , which could very well even be given a PG rating ) .
508824	453068	338751	10.0	A truly smashing , psychologically bound blockbuster	Martin Scorsese strikes again with a powerful cast and expert crew , but the subject matter is what really got me into the grip of The Aviator . Scorsese and writer John Logan focus , of course , on the prime of the life of Howard Hughes , a kind of c . f . Kane with airplanes and movies substituting for the newspapers . While Scorsese dives right into his technical mastery , Logan dives into the private life of Hughes as well as the public . As a kind of ' golden-age of Hollywood ' production the film hearkens back to the greatness from the old days , but also taking on a subject that is a tough one to take on - Hughes ' obsessive compulsive nature . On the outside to the public he does go like this to a degree - spending millions on his air epic Hell's Angels , going past the limit of what to spend on planes for the second world war ( and " the Hercules " which the press dubbed the " Spruce Goose " ) , and with women . But on the inside , he gradually became a full-blown germaphobe , repeating words , and locking himself in a room at one point and not coming out ( this would later be what many remembered him for , the notoriously reclusive Billionair hermit of the 20th century ) . With Scorsese's outstanding cinematographer Robert Richardson , experimenting with different touches of light and composition , and with his veteran editor Thelma Schoonmaker ( partly responsible for the immediately recognizable pace and style in Scorsese's films ) , they get into the mind of someone like Hughes better than any other film I may have ever seen . It's often kinetic , focusing on the smallest things , and going ( appropriately ) sometimes like an Olver Stone film . Although Gangs of New York , Scorsese's previous epic , contained a good pace , I may have not seen one as intense and effective since Casino . Adding to this is Dante Ferreti , one of the greatest of all production designers , giving life to all of the locations in the film . Most surprising , and satisfying , is that the acting is better than expected , or at least topping expectations . Di Caprio , who was the originator of bringing Hughes ' life to the screen ( he also has an executive producer credit ) , dashes off any minor doubts I had that he could pull it off . He can be a superb actor , engaging fully a character ( What's Eating Gilbert Grape , Gangs , and Basketball Diaries being good examples ) , and sometimes not ( Titanic , Catch Me if You Can ) . This time , he hits it right on the head , giving ( though it's never a big deal for me who wins or loses ) an Oscar caliber performance . By the time the story and Hughes swing deeper into his disease , before and following a tragic , heart-racing plane accident , he finds all of the touches to make Hughes believable , flaws and all . It certainly is , along with it being the convincing take on o . c . d . technically , the finest portrayal of someone with it . But even greater is that he finds the notes when with his co-stars . There is Cate Blanchett ( as if not more terrific than Di Caprio ) as Katherine Hepburn , Hughes ' love interest for about ten years . Something of an eccentric character herself , but also very down to earth , Blanchett doesn't skip a beat in finding her own voice within the star . There are also parts like John C . Reilly , Hughes ' financial adviser ( and part father-figure ) , Alan Alda , a senator who brings Hughes forward to be questioned in a public committee , Alec Baldwin as Hughes ' ' foe ' Juan Trippe , and so on . Even for an actress like Kate Beckinsale , who I feared would be hardly worthy to fill a role like Ava Gardner , the environment Scorsese gives to them is very natural considering the Hollywood backdrop . It's always tricky calling one film the best of the year . Many other films that came out this year were big contenders for such a somewhat pretentious title . It could be appropriate for one to say that The Aviator , while not one of Scorsese's best , is one of the best Hollywood productions of the year . At the least , if only from my perspective , it delivers a Scorsese film where he takes a risk at a subject he doesn't know too much about ( aviation , though he didn't know much about boxing either for Raging Bull ) and runs with the people in the film , reaching for a height some might feel he can't really take .
509739	453068	18217	10.0	an early Soviet classic of visuals that should be seen by anyone serious about editing	I think that Sergei Eisenstein , who has ( rightfully ) been credited as one of the grandfathers of modern cinema , is sometimes forgotten as someone who can really direct great epic scenes along with making them expertly edited . The filmmaker here knows he's pushing along an ideology , one that is not only encouraged but all but required of him to give to the public . But he also knows that to put out the message there needs to be some conviction , surprise , something to catch eyes as the information's already known . Perhaps even to a greater extent than Battleship Potemkin , October : Ten Days That Shook the World puts on display a director with total confidence not only in his flourishing , insistent style , but in that of his mostly non-professional actors , crowds , real-locations , sets , and his crew . It's one of the most assured pieces of silent film-making I've ever seen , and it's taken a few viewings to take in everything in one sitting ( I ended up watching half an hour , and then sitting back trying to remember everything I just saw , or thought I saw ) . Some uses of montage in the film - make that most if not all - rival those of even the better editors working in commercials and music videos today . Like those editors , they're working with images meant to be dynamic and to the point . Here it's the story of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution in Russia , where Lenin took control of the reigns of the provisional government with left the country at a stand-still in poverty . Or , at least , that's how the film would definitely lead things onto . Watching a film like this and seeing 100 % accuracy is irrelevant . But watching it to get a sense of what cinema is supposed to - and can do - with tricky subject matter , is completely worthwhile . Some of these scenes are just pure masterpieces of crowd control ; when the people mass together in the town square , for example , one might immediately think of the Odessa stairs from Potemkin . Here , however , there's more than one chance for such operatic takes on harsh realities . The beginning - where they tear down the statue - is striking enough . But just watch when the crowd has to disperse and runs around early on in the film , or especially the storming of the Winter Palace . Could you do the same material with computers today ? More than likely , but not with the same conviction and ' this-was-really-happening ' feel that a camera ( recreating ) on the scene could get . And , sometimes , as when the monument / statue gets ' put back together ' , it's almost amusing but still convincing of what the medium can do . And soon enough Eisenstein reaches his climax , the immense lot of 10 days that brought the country to a peak of change and possible prosperity for its people . It's like October for the Russian people of the time is like a thousand or so snapshots of that time and place in the world . The one point that Eisenstein poses for his viewers - not just for his of-the-period silent film crowd but for those watching today - is that he is not making it boring for those who can give themselves to the images , the moments taken with some shots more than others . Anyone getting into editing , I think , should see at least some of Eisenstein's films to get an idea of where the smoke of post-modern film-making generated . October is probably one of his prime examples ; if you want to watch it for purely historical or political contexts it may be hit or miss depending on point of view , but it is hard to see as a misfire in telling a story using spectacular and imaginative compositions with the frame , lighting , and with specific , profound musical accompaniment by Edmund Meisel .
509553	453068	381681	10.0	what fascinates and interests almost works to annoy the viewer , but Linklater does come closest to Bergman here	Before Sunset provides us not so much a sequel as a continuing development in the lives of these characters , who are starting to embody the neuroses and deeply-held desires that neither want to admit to until it's at the most crucial and tragic of times . Jessie ( Ethan Hawke ) and Celine ( Julie Delpy ) , who first met on a train in Vienna in 1994 , meet again nine years later as Jessie has published a book which is based on that night they had together . He's in Paris , they meet again , and before he has his plane back to the states they talk , and talk , and talk , and unlike in the first film there are no asides . It's just two people who at first talk about concerns that came up for them the first time , if a bit more pragmatic : what it is to have concern over the environment , to live in the USA , to be involved enough in a relationship . There's even a moment of deja-vu where they talk about reincarnation and a respect for faith if not an embracing of it . But then we also get to see something much deeper in each side that Jessie's book and mere re-appearance for Celine brings out a memory that has become hyper-realized , and vice-versa . Like Bergman's films , in particular Scenes From a Marriage ( if not as wholly successful because of its short running time here ) , Linklater provides us with characters who have no problem saying what's on their mind , in the immediate sense anyway . Jessie is even more digging-in with his cynicism and wit , and Celine with her opinions on the world at large , family and on past relationships . But when it comes to getting at their connection , it's very fragile and even unattainable because of each side's own flaws . If the two of them were happy , to be certain , there would be no movie , but it's the characters ' connection to that one night in Vienna , and the second meeting that was supposed to take place six months later and never happened , and how it cripples their own romantic lives that becomes very interesting yet shallow at the same time . Perhaps this is the best way to show how smart , functional people become dysfunctional in their respective social stratospheres - Jessie is married and with a kid , but not very happy in it , and Celine is in bad relationship after bad relationship - but the singular , glossy night of years past has become a bitter shrine of sorts amid their respective neuroses . Linklater shares that incredible Bergman quality of cutting past the already sharp intellect to the emotional matter of the parties , even if it doesn't feel totally complete ; I want to see how their story might end , however obvious it should and probably would be . One knows this could never work in real life , aside from the practical-side of it all , yet it's this that makes it all the more watchable . This , plus the incredibly natural repore of the actors , as Hawke and Delpy , as to be expected , seem like they aren't even on a script but are being filmed by Linklater on the fly as his camera captures the given-luscious scapes of Paris in afternoon , and the dialog is still as fresh and inviting as ever . If it lacks anything from the first it's an greater sense of the possibility for romance , since this time the sense of romance is entangled in loss and questions that Celine and Jessie want answered , however conscious they want them answered or not . But as with the first one , I still loved being around these two , who can expound a mouthful on a subject that we all might talk about , almost shockingly similar ( one bit I liked a lot was Celine's story of going to Poland ) , and then in a slight cloud of romanticism . It ends ambiguous , maybe too ambiguous , as I found myself saying ' huh , what ' , but it ties into what Jessie tells the reporters at the press conference early in the film : one may take away something from this tale , or someone else another , but there it is , clear as day . Before Sunset is a straightforward romance , and proud of it , being both straightforward in romantic connection and as sharp as anything you'd never find in your local cineplex . One of Linklater's best .
508990	453068	67140	10.0	One of the best westerns / war films made in the 70's : brutal , violent , funny , poetically tragic , etc . . .	With Fistful of Dyanmite ( a . k . a . ' Duck , You Sucker ' , a . k . a . ' Once Upon a Time in the Revolution ' , the second part of a ' trilogy ' ) , legendary Sergio Leone puts together something experimental , even more so than the other films in his catalog . Here he now deals with war , but he still has the crime elements of his ' dollars ' films ; it somehow makes a very clear cut balance between bits of comedy within the tragedy worked in the story ; it isn't very brutal , but it is graphic in the genre sense of the time . It's also one of his best films , if you happen to see it within its full running time ( like most of Leone's films , this suffered drastic cuts in American versions , reducing critical character points and other Leone surprises ) . A Leone film , however , can only be as strong as the leads pushing it up , as in the dozens and dozens of westerns and other films that inspired Leone . Here he uses two character actors ( for the most part of their careers ) , but indeed very good and astute ones at playing their parts . Rod Steiger , who has been in classic films like On the Waterfront and The Pawnbroker , here is slightly like a maturer version of Tuco from The Good , the Bad , and the Ugly : he's still a bandit , with pillaging and beating and raping his way across the countryside , but he's also got a family to look after , who within his anti-hero heart are the most important things to him . Steiger's Juan is usually either surprised , quietly delighted , or agitated off to certain degrees . He plays this for all it's worth , but he also finds the best notes in the moments when he brings out laughs , and in the more sorrowful moments later on in the film . There's also James Coburn , veteran of many , many films , given one of the great themes of any character in a Leone film by composer Ennio Morricone ( there's some sort of instrument or distortion of one in his theme that calls for complete , unusual attention on the viewer ) . Coburn's Sean ( err , John , depending ) is a character with some ghosts , perhaps , in his past , and who unlike Juan is more interested in ' other ' interests . Although Juan tries not to notice it until the sequence at Mesa Verde ( which I won't reveal ) , Sean has been through a revolution in Ireland , and understand more or less what happens with it . He brings in Juan , after a rather strange yet hilarious encounter , into his web of revolutionary fighters , which doesn't go over to well with him at first . As their story unravels , Coburn still plays it like a pro , being the straight character to Steiger's very theatrical-like performance . He doesn't quite have the mystery an Eastwood or Bronson had in the other Leone films , but he does carry a certain quality about him that puts him in a needed place in the Leone cannon . Speaking of which , one must not over-look how complex a film like this is in some ways . Leone was not originally the director ( it went through the hands of Peter Bogdanovich and Sam Peckinpah before coming to him , coincidentally the opening scene with Juan is a cool homage to the Wild Bunch opening ) . Yet somehow he puts his stamp , and wonderful mark , on Fistful of Dynamite . This time more history is worked into the film - unlike the civil war acting like a harsh backdrop to the more ' fun ' elements of the adventure in The Good , the Bad , and the Ugly , the war in this film affects the main character , and adds a serious tone to an otherwise standard genre picture . The Steiger character , along with the audience , gets a look at a massive amount of death , or rather the images of the dead : a tower filled with soldiers blown at night , the powerful pans and camera moves across the bodies , real combat , and the suggestions of what goes into the revolution . But its not just the violence of battles that get into the film , its also the personal attitudes during the revolution - the bourgeois vs the peasants ( one of Leone's masterstrokes at close-ups in montage is displayed when Juan is on the train with the near monstrous American wealthy early in the film ) . Leone manages to work in various and cinematic explosions , in-depth or testing close-ups , and sweeping long shots of soldiers , landscapes , and struggle . Coming back to Ennio Morricone's score - this time , Morricone experiments with some styles of his talents . As when Leone uses a funny , almost cartoon-like , image above Sean from Juans ' eyes of a ' Banco ' sign ( akin the a ' dollar ' sign above cartoon characters ) , Morricone adds a church organ and choir to go along with it . There are also the uses of themes throughout the film , as in Leone's other films , that act like striking , beautiful calling cards . The opening theme is pounding ; Sean's flashbacks are given the sumptuous qualities that go with the best ( and worst ) nostalgia ; the scenes with action and suspense , though almost a little standard , still work far better than many standard score of today . Fistful of Dynamite is entertainment on an epic scale , with a broader and somewhat deeper sub-text , and it comes out with flying colors . Some may not take to it ; it could be argued that Steiger , much like Eli Wallach , isn't very convincing as a Mexican bandit , or that the shifting in tones is a little much , even conventional in a weird sense . But it's hard to argue the sense of control that Leone has over his environment in the film , the assuredness of style , and that at the least the parts are greater than the whole . For me , it's a film I've seen twice in one week ( once to soak in and get more of the enjoyment , the second time to get even more out of it , and to notice the visual details ) , and I hope it gets better the next time around .
509156	453068	60390	10.0	Truffaut adapts a hard edged , frightening , and hopeful futuristic action / drama	This is one of the most exciting , incendiary , and poignant films of Francois Truffaut's career . Any problems that happened off the set ( fueds between Truffaut and star Oscar Werner ) are not prevalent here - this is a film that with its style captures the kind of thought process behind Ray Bradbury's classic futuristic cautionary tale . I read the book in high school , and loved it , but hadn't seen the movie till recently . It was hard to remember most of the book ( coincidentally a theme in this film is remembering what books give us ) , but I remembered the major points - Guy Montag ( here played by Werner ) is a fireman , putting out books with fires . Like a gestapo rooting for prisoners for the concentration camp , they ransack homes they find suspect , and torch all the books in sight . The thought behind this , the boss says , is that books are what tear people apart . Instead , television is the enlightenment of the masses ( sound familiar ) . Montag doesn't question much of this until he meets a woman , Clarisse ( Julie Christie , curiously enough in another role as Montag's stagnant , common wife ) , who tries to instill Montag a meaning with books . This also flies over his head until he meets a professor or other , who somehow also stirs the bug in Montag . He starts to slip a book here and there during the fire raids , and is drawn in . It leads up to a kind of revolution in Montag's mind-set , where to run away from it all is the only choice left . These scenes are filmed with an intensity and urgency that is trademark in Truffaut ( i . e . most of 400 Blows , certain parts of Jules & Jim ) and on a sensory level gets to one almost above most other regular thrillers . We care about Montag , the sort of empty vessel that is starting to fill in , and it leads up to a somewhat funny , but rewarding finale . Truffaut , learning from one of his masters ( Hitchcock ) , not only gives Bradbury's story that extra push in certain scenes ( and certain restraint for psychological effect , i . e . scenes at Montag's house with his wife ) , there is a certain originality that gets to the viewer emotionally . During a couple of key scenes when the firemen are burning up the books , in particular with an old woman with the biggest hoard of them , he presents a montage of close-ups , all the various books and pages burning . This is a directness that would not have been found in Hollywood at the time , and it brings out the sense of loss that clouds over this society in the film . While many of the satirical points in the film are Bradbury's , and the ring truer today than ever before ( control , suppression of intelligence , control of the Government with the media ) , Truffaut's job of filming it is key and ultimately very successful . There are also the performances turned in ; Werner , maybe not as good as in Jules & Jim , makes a believable Montag , even through his struggling English ; Christie , juggling between two completely different characters , pulls it off ; Cyril Cusack as Montag's boss is like one of those villain roles that often gets overlooked in polls , as he really gets you to despise this character . One must also not overlook Bernard Herrmann's tense score , and eye-popping cinematography from Nicholas Roeg .
511011	453068	1245104	10.0	excellent , uproarious throwback to 40's Disney shorts , with a touch of Looney Tunes	This is a wonderful homage / recreation of the kinds of shorts kids used to go ape over back in the 1940s . It starts off with the opening titles , which are a direct reference to those shorts of old ( not like the usual PIXAR shorts ) . Then it thrusts into the situation with total glee : a magician is having trouble with his rabbit for a very simple reason - the rabbit wants its carrot NOW , and won't get it . Then a series of totally over the top gags occur , making the usual rabbit-out-of-the-hat trick seem like kid's stuff in comparison . While it's ingenious and clever and all that and a bag of carrots , it's also a good mini-homage to the spirit of Looney Tunes shorts . There isn't too much missing except to replace Bugs in place of the cute white rabbit . Its sweetness is quintessential Disney stuff though , and its a great little addition at the start of WALLE . Don't miss it !
507943	453068	257044	10.0	A very well told coming of age / father and son / gangster picture , the best of its kind since Bronx Tale . . .	. . . although it is very difficult to compare it to the likes of the Godfather , which many critics have talked of following the release of Sam Mendes ' ( Best Picture of 99 American Beauty Mendes ' 2nd effort ) Road to Perdition . However in truth , this film takes place in a universe all its own , giving connection to Al Capone here and there and scenes of mid-west life in depression era America , yet the story with its plot and characters are what matter and Mendes and screenwriter Self know this from first frame to last . Tom Hanks gets another challenge this time ( after a retard , an AIDS patient , an island survivor and a conflicted World War 2 soldier ) , in getting a role of the likes of Michael Sullivan Sr , a expertly trained hit-man for boss John Rooney ( Paul Newman in one of the years best supporting roles ) , since his is a life that is cold and ruthless and sometimes compassionate given the circumstances , and Hanks pulls it off in his compelling fashion and it can be seen even in the more subtle scenes , like with his son Michael Jr . They go on the run when Rooney's son Conner shoots Hanks ' other son and wife , and the story unfolds from there , which includes a juicy , sinister persona sent on Hanks ' tale named Maguire ( Jude Law ) . With photography by Conrad L . Hall that ranks with some of the best so far this decade and performances made to match the edge , this is THE dramatic thriller of the season ; one of the best pictures of the year .

508955	453068	48308	10.0	great as spectacle and technical wonder , but also a heartbreaking tale of a lost woman	It is not entirely fair to recommend Lola Montes so highly , or admire it so , since even the version that screened recently at the Film Forum in NYC , purported to be the definitive restoration , is still a truncated version . The original director's cut that premiered in France in 1955 , and then to immediate withdrawal after its " disaster " of a reception at 140 minutes , is no longer available . At the least , it's a saving grace that so much has been saved in this 115 minute cut , considering how many version there are and how they vary with the running time . And , for Pete sake , if by some chance you can see it on the big-screen ( it's soon to leave the Film Forum for its second run following the re-release last October and its re-premiere at the NYFF ) , do so . The filmmaker , Max Ophuls , in what was his unintentional swan song - he died at 55 - shot the hell out of this picture , with director of photography Christian Matras taking the 2 : 35 : 1 frame with new Eastmancolor by the horns and shaking it for all it could be worth within the context of a " vibrant " 19th century costume melodrama bio-pic . The colors all jump off so splendidly , with such a force that compels one to not have too long of a blink , as to do so would be to miss on little surprises , little things that Ophuls uses in his frame which he careens and swivels and moves around with the freedom of a curious , pleasantly intoxicated fowl . It's one of the first masterpieces of the widescreen color film . But it's not just a great film in technical terms . That would be too easy perhaps for Ophuls , who uses this backdrop of the sweeping and sensational to pierce through other deeper things going on with the characters . In Lola Montes his character is someone who re-lives what has happened in her relatively short life ( relatively since she's not really " old " in the sense of being tucked away from the public's gaze ) as a main attraction in a French circus . She's an object first and person second in this context , which as one can imagine bustles and throbs with excitement and fun as only something of a cousin to Fellini could be . And yet as a person she's had quite a journey to where she's at : from aristocratic daughter given away to a marriage she has to run away from ( unfaithful husband , figures with a wife who is about as beautiful a being as could be in the immediate vicinity ) , then becomes a ballerina ( her childhood dream ) , and then . . . well , a topic of gossip and scandal , such as romancing a conductor , all ending in Bavaria with her hopes of possibly settling down squandered for good . Hence the circus gig . It's a story that's given that same kaleidoscopic view as in Citizen Kane , but this time with the twist that the protagonist isn't given the sort of " luxury " of already being dead as the story of a life is sifted through and given a LARGER-than-LIFE context . Lola's story is a spectacle , sometimes farce , sometimes legend , sometimes one of those too-much-to-believe sagas that keeps those glued to their seats while Lola also entertains with trapeze work ! And yet under the blue lights , under the costume changes and other mock-ups and even the Q & A sessions that the ringmaster holds with the audience and Lola , the soul of this woman is about as " there " as a near-empty gas tank . She may still be alive , but it's a kind of limbo that would be too insane if it weren't true and played out to full spectacle and extravaganza . As said , this is a work of true technical mastery , and there's one amazing camera move or one amazing little direction ( I just smiled ear to ear seeing in the opening how the circus performers rolled out , and it stayed for a solid five minutes ) . But , too , Ophuls has an engaging , wonderful actress on top of having a complete knockout visually : Martine Carol , who I'm not sure I've seen outside of this film , pulls out a performance that wavers between weepy , flustered , driven , elegant , tortured , calm and hiding back hysteria . It's half diva and half substantially undermined human soul , and she pulls it off like it's the performance of a life . Good marks also go to Peter Ustinov as the Ringmaster , chugging along through a script that he knows almost too well ( we get very amusing asides with one of the " little " people in the red costumes trying to get their change back from him mid-act ) , and the actor who played the Bavarian king . In Ophuls hands , they're not just other pieces of the set , but actors who work so diligently to make this all one cohesive piece . And , really , that's what makes Lola Montes ultimately so remarkable . Ophuls has moments of melodrama , maybe so much so that one will have to really love costume-period-melodrama flicks to really appreciate it ( I actually don't usually , this is an exception ) , and at the same time they all work as part of this story about what lies behind the pomp and circumstance . You can get lost from time to time in this movie , and it's thrilling to get wrapped up in it . And as well as an artistic achievement of considerable proportions , it's a really fun movie to boot .
509203	453068	75314	10.0	A Disturbing and Powerful Masterpiece	Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is a riveting , disturbing and powerful masterpiece of a film that gives new meaning to the word " snapped " . The scenes , quotes and characters are legendary and so is this film giving breakthrough performances to Albert Brooks , Jodie Foster , and of course , Robert De Niro . De Niro plays Travis Bickle , a disturbed taxi driver who drives his taxi all around new York City going crazier every day . He also meets Iris ( AKA Easy ) played by Foster who is also disturbed , but in a not as good way . And what the story leads up to is one of the most memorable pieces of cinema ever . The film is great , the score by Bernard Hermann ( his last ) is excellent , and the feeling , and atmosphere is perfect . So , " are you talking to me " ?
508770	453068	75276	10.0	the story of man's incredible / mundane downfall , in one of Herzog's best	What an unclassifiable hybrid / whatever movie Stroszek is . I'd wager it's the kind of picture that Gonzo the Great ( yes , the Muppet ) would probably make if he were from Germany and looking to make a tragic-comic look on one man's journey in the rural side of America ( after all , the last sequence would make perfect sense , wouldn't it ) . In truth , it's Werner Herzog at his most focused and un-hinged , a work of wild , original art where the tone ranges from harsh reality , documentary realism ( or so we might think ) , to drama stripped of its ' melo ' , and a brand of satire that goes beyond the usual realm and is satirical only in the sense that you know something is being made fun of . In fact , I'd say the last twenty-five , thirty minutes of this picture are the funniest , and even in these minutes there's a sense of sorrow to what has happened with Bruno Stroszek ( Bruno S . , sort of as himself , I suppose , the line between fiction and fact is so blurry that it's the only way Herzog can get things done ) and how his girlfriend ( Eva Mattes ) leaves him , and his best friend and neighbor gets arrested after armed robbery of a , uh , store in a basement next to a bank , I guess . But whatever weirdness and sort of everyday mundane qualities that go hand in hand with the film Stroszek are given a greater context . I actually had a little more interest in what was going on after having just seen Chaplin's Modern Times , and seeing how there could be a comparison made to the two . Of course , Herzog could never be one to induce the silly physical comedy that makes up the bulk of Chaplin's films , but there is a similarity that struck me , and helped make me really care about what was going on with these characters - Herzog , for all his showing the ultimate follies , loves Stroszek , or at least does not try and show him off as being a complete waste of life . And if it does almost come off that way ( Stroszek is , after all , a perpetual drunk who got released only recently from the mental hospital , and can never get steady work aside from being a mechanic once in the US ) , it's off-set by how much he even cares about the much more flawed Eva , too . He sees them in a context of society and civilization as well as just stand-alone outcasts ( outcasts being another Chaplin comparison ) not to mention the other side characters , both wretchedly cruel and mean like the Germans who bully Stroszek and beat up on Eva , or the wacky co-workers and very formal mortgage / loan people . So , in a way , Herzog takes on the other side of what we might usually find in a Chaplin effort , which includes cynicism ( at least skepticism ) , despair , and replacing morality with a truly twisted sense of humor . Not that the form of documentary , more than anything , peeks its head into the work . There isn't much story to report , aside from the bulk of what I've already mentioned - Stroszek , Eva and their elderly neighbor escape from the harsh and cruel state of being they're at in Berlin ( a brief but interesting commentary on Germany too ) , only to find in the small-town Wisconsin life not much more in line of prosperity . Soon , Stroszek is on his own when he loses his trailer-home , Eva leaves him after a drunken ramble he goes on , and of course the aforementioned botched robbery . He heads off randomly to another small town , tells his story to a random guy , and then as his truck goes up in flames , he gets caught on a ski-lift after passing by a dancing chicken . All the while Bruno S . plays this guy with no punches pulled , and is as intuitive a non-professional actor as any given others in the old neo-realist days . Eva , too , wasn't that much of an actress yet when she took on this role . And a lot of the time ( David Lynch mentioned this in an interview as he started watching the film in the middle ) it's like watching a documentary of these people , showing in all the ordinary working-class ways how they get stuck and any chance of the " American dream " gets squashed . One's never really sure who's an actor or not , but it makes no difference really . A lot of it is some of the most harrowing cinema that I've seen in a while - the tone is of a bitterness at the system , any system , and of a sorrow that is everlooming , that is , perhaps , until the ending . Remarkable then is really how much I laughed during the film . Even in the earlier scenes , when it was dreary , the sort of behavior in parts , and especially notes of the dialog , rang of the complete randomness that is all abound in Herzog's work . But one only needs to look at Stroszek to see the Herzog sense of humor working full-tilt amid the social commentary and despair . The two funniest sequences - not withstanding the armed robbery - are the auction scene ( that guy , wow , just wow is all I could say after that ) , and the dancing chicken . A big chunk of the dancing chicken scene's bizarre appeal is the music , with a true absurdity to the harmonica playing and wailing vocals . Many over the years have wondered the significance of the dancing chicken , most particularly as the ending to the picture . While Herzog himself claims it to be a metaphor for something he can't place , a friend mentioned that it could be capitalism , or the chicken as a representation of Bruno Stroszek , or of an American in general . I wouldn't want to jump to any conclusions just yet , and I'm glad that way - all I know is that it's one of the funniest three minutes of film to ever come out of Europe . It's Herzog's ultimate , tragic-comic tale about a man in the lower depths of himself and his society .
509415	453068	105695	10.0	The Best Picture of 1992	This film is great . It won 4 Oscars ( including Best Director for Eastwood and Best Picture ) and are well deserved . Unlike some other wetserns with gun slingers and such , this one is quite different . Here , Eastwood plays a man who for years has tried to forget his past , but it comes back to haunt him after the death of one of his friends . Very important to the film genre as it is to Eastwood , making him one of the best directors and stars around . One of the best westerns ever and the best film of 1992 ( though kids might get scared ) .
509240	453068	90756	10.0	Bizarre , frightening , oddly beautiful	David Lynch's Blue Velvet is many things , but it definitely is one of the most audacious and original pictures from the 80's . It blends in humor from the good old days and macabre that would make Tobe Hooper cringe ( if only a little bit ) . It's a type of movie filled with so much style and little cinema tricks that some might not see the substance . I saw it about three times in two days to get it all in and I must say that the films themes do match the style on the surface . Beneath is something that the viewer will have to judge and I can not go into . Kyle MacLaughlin plays a regular kid who comes upon a single ear and that is the start of his search to find who is behind the cutting of this ear . He and another teenage girl ( Laura Dern in a very early role ) , or mainly by himself , he fins a possibly mentally unbalanced nightclub singer ( Isabella Rosselini ) is in danger from a hopped up madman , played by Dennis Hopper in one of his top 5 roles ever . One thing I should point out though , is that when I said it is in the viewer's hands often in this film is because Rosselini's character is alternately meant to be sympathetic , but then she does acts and wants acts done to her ( get my drift ) that will make many seem puzzled as how a woman caught in a situation like the one she's in can be so fed up . In the overall view , the film brings a compelling story brought even more compelling with awesome performances and style to burn . Some might not find the humor spread about and might feel angry ( a certain R . Ebert for example ) when uneeded satire is brought to a scene where a woman is lying naked on a lawn . But I just think it's meant to soften the shock , if only in some demented way . A worthwhile view into the perpetual dark-side of human nature , if only once .
510212	453068	44391	10.0	a movie that embraces the Hollywood studio machine while putting a harsh criticism of it	That one line summary makes me sound like I'm calling the Bad and the Beautiful a case in ' tough love ' , where director Vincente Minnelli wags his finger at what happens to some people ( cough , David O . Selznick , cough ) , while also showing too the joys of working in the business . But it's a business at its most booming time , coming out of the 40s where the producer was king , and the director had to vie for room at times to really get his vision in . Here the producer Jonathan Shields is played by Kirk Douglas as someone with big ideas at first - he even has an idea to help make a scary movie about cats even more frightening by not showing the cats ( echoes of Val Lewton ) . Soon he rises the ranks and becomes big enough to really call the shots all he wants , but it also gets in the way of personal relationships , severs ties , and sometimes even makes him out to be monstrous ( there's one shot I remember all the time where Douglas , in a big fit of anger against Lana Turner's character , seems like he's a whole foot taller with the ego almost manifested ) . The narrative of the film is a retelling by people who knew him , a sexy but soon disillusioned actress , a director who once worked with Shields but then got cut off from him , and a writer played by Dick Powell . Rashomon or Citizen Kane it is not in trying to reveal more grandiose and amazing things about human nature , but rather a supreme rumination on the good times and the bad times , possibly more of the latter . What's great about Douglas's portrayal is that through the stories from the three ex-friends and co-workers and lovers , he becomes a very well-rounded character . At the core , of course , is the producer who at the time had as more creative say than anyone else on the set . This brings some of the great scenes ever shown about movie-making , such as the moment when Amiel , the director , tries to put Jonathan in his place about how a scene should be shot , " in order to direct a picture you need humility " . Another comes with the moment when Jonathan and his soon to be ' asistant to the producer ' has to object out of just being stunned . But more than Douglas , it's also tremendous , memorable screen time for Lana Turner , perhaps in her most successful performance in just sheer acting terms ( not necessarily just in presence or style like in other pictures ) , and for Dick Powell , who with this and Murder My Sweet has two defining roles outside of his usual niche . With many sweet camera moves , a script that crackles with the kind of scenes and dialog that makes one wish for the glory times of Hollywood's Golden Age , and at least four or five really excellent performances , The Bad and the Beautiful might not be as astounding and near-perfect as 8 or as funny as Bowfinger , but it ranks up there with the best movies about movie-making , and can make for some fine entertainment even for those who aren't really interested in how movies are made .
508576	453068	28950	10.0	Thoroughly enjoyable , memorable characters and scenes , an early classic in humanist / prison escape films	I can't deny that Jean Renoir has a genuine eye for human connectedness and moves his camera with a practical naturalness . The performances by the principal actors as well ( Jean Gabin as the working-class Marechal , Pierre Fresnay as the eloquent Boieldieu , Marcel Dalio as the subtle and happy Rosenthal , and Erich von Stroheim as the un-mistakenly stiffest and suavest of movie prison wardens Captain von Rauffenstein ) are on the money every step of the way . Perhaps my one problem ( and it's not a big one ) with The Grand Illusion is that despite it being made at a time when cinema , in particular sound cinema , was just starting out , there could've been better targets hit by Renoir . He hits on a mark with these prisoners as well as with the guards - these are regular people , caught up and made to feel like they're in the schoolyard with ruthless heads and rebellious minions . As a satire , for some reason , it works a lot better for me than a drama - at least at first . For example , when Marechal is in solitary in the first prison , this is a masterpiece of a scene in and of itself , and for some reason I wanted more moments like this . While this could be attributable to the fact that Renoir didn't film everything he had intended with his script ( lack of budget one can assume ) , there are some expectations that weren't up to what could've been met . This may be variable from viewer to viewer , which is why this shouldn't deter those interested in seeing this - this is one of those POW films that's inspired others ( i . e . Great Escape ) , but has a sort of spirit that's all it's own . On the other hand in what comes out when one takes more of a look - which Renoir allows through how watchable ( in terms of just being able to not turn off the film once it starts ) the drama does become integrated with the critical view of the characters and changing situation . It's almost TOO complex , if that's possible . One of the fantastic joys of Grand Illusion is how much there is life and energy in his scenes depicting the prisons of world war one . Like in a Fellini drama ( which it may very well have inspired for the later Italian ) , there's a lot pf love for how cinema is made itself to get too depressed with the story & characters . And like in a neo-realist film , the dialog between the people is quite realistic and interesting . Some of the supporting characters / actions may seem odd to some new viewers , although one has to take into context the period . With an awesome cameraman ( Christian Matras ) , finite music score by Joseph Kosma , and an escape scene that's almost as thrilling as what Darabont cooked up in Shawshank , Grand Illusion is deservedly so the first film released by the Criterion collection ( DVDs ) , and is a suave , nice note in film history . AND , it definitely becomes better upon repeat viewings , as these characters become more familiar , as if we're in there in the prisons with these amicable , existential beings .
