513027	3223254	371675	1.0	An Unfortunate Display of Opportunism	Anytime the urge rises to be entertained with an escapist film the top of the list becomes one of the Asian martial arts films , films of stunning beauty , breathtaking choreography , handsome actors , and enough legend to make the storyline fascinating , e . g . ' The House of Flying Daggers ' . This pathetic film is packaged like those wonder movies and so deludes the public into thinking it is in an equal category . Not even close ! A child is born to a couple informed that their progeny will be a male warrior who has the secrets to read the codebook that contains the key to the power of the universe . The pregnant mother is stabbed by the evil adversaries but the baby lives , ' disappointingly ' a girl ! The girl Seki is transported via a leaf boat to a blind wise magician who cares for her and teaches her Taiji and Kung Fu , raising her to return to the world and discover life along with her gifts . A family who wants to maintain dominion over China sends two sons ( one evil and the other kind ) to capture the girl and steal the code to the sacred book . The evil son is accompanied by warriors : the kind son is accompanied by Caucasian Marx brothers . The rest of the story is too simple-minded to discuss . There are so many errors of judgment in the making of this film , not the least of which is a nebulous and silly script , that disrupt what might have been an honest attempt for Hollywood to make a martial arts film . But the acting is poor , combining Asian actors with non-Asian actors makes both look ridiculous , the special effects are clumsy , and the mood of ancient China is completely destroyed by the computer generated graphics superimposed on the real location of Griffith Park in Los Angeles ! The three stooges added to the good warrior's team are so silly that they pass funny into absurd . There is no ending to the movie : instead it feels like the producers just ran out of money . A must miss .
513250	3223254	301771	2.0	Rent a Husband Italian Style	' Mariti in affitto ' ( ' Our Italian Husband ' ) is sort of a mess of a movie . Ilaria Borrelli wrote and directed this bilingual film and apparently lost track of her story during the making of it . The Italian language portions are supplemented by English subtitles , but the English , when spoken , is so distorted by the actors and by the musical sound track that the words are nearly incomprehensible . What results is a slapstick comedy acted way over the top to the point of frustration on the part of the audience . The action opens somewhere in Italy where Maria Scocozza ( Maria Grazia Cucinotta ) is eking out a living making sandals to support her two children from her marriage to artist Vincenzo Scocozza ( Pierfrancesco Favino ) who left for America some years ago to make it big in New York . Maria is courted by older gentlemen who threaten her to the point that she leaves with her two children to fly to New York to re-join her husband . Upon arrival she finds an unfriendly country but no husband and is befriended by Raul ( Diego Serrano ) who eventually finds her work passing out fliers for an agency called ' Rent a Husband ' . She eventually discovers her husband has remarried to TV model Charlene ( Brooke Shields ) who is extremely pregnant . Outraged but with no place to go , Maria and her two children move in with Charlene and Vincenzo , and as predicted the two women eventually join to plot against the two-timing Vincenzo . . . etc etc etc . The acting is raw - Chevy Chase even has a role as a TV writer - and the performances all border on overacting . There is a hint that somewhere in this mélange of ideas there are some solid humanistic points to be made , but everything gets lost in the mess of a production . Not a very good way to spend an evening .
512751	3223254	470765	2.0	An Acquired Taste	Christopher Guest is a creative spirit who has been able to make some very funny films like ' Best In Show ' where his technique of avoiding a script by giving his cast of actors an outline as matrix for a scene , letting them ad lib the idea a couple of times , then accepting the second or third take as the final product - pasting all the bits together in the edit . Sometimes it works : sometimes it flounders . Or to quote a famous advertisement ' Sometimes you feel like a nut , sometimes you don't ' . For this viewer this mocumentary about a very bad film company churning out a very bad film with a rather pitiful cast of actors falling victim to Internet rumors that an Oscar is in the air works as a funny idea and social comment for about the first half four and then sadly falls apart painfully as it proceeds to its wholly predictable end . Guest uses his usual company of actors ( Catherine O'Hara , Parker Posey , etc ) and they seem to have a good time making fun of themselves ultimately . Yes , there are funny moments , but the further the movie plods the less funny the moments become and ultimately the result of the ' rumor of greatness ' shows us the shallow lives of the sad sack troupe of actors and producers and writers that started out with a pretty awful idea . Guest usually pulls these capers off nicely , but perhaps with such films as ' The Producers ' musical on the screens simultaneously the joke is stale . It is a good film to watch as Oscar time is upon us - and there is some pungent jabbing at awards concepts floating through the film . This is a movie for Guest fans , but not a good start for those who don't know his work . Grady Harp
512830	3223254	884328	2.0	A Movie with Many Problems	THE MIST has the full panorama of responses , from those who find it ' the best of the Stephen King story adaptations ' to those who find it a feeble attempt to wed science fiction with biblical predictions . Frank Darabont has successfully brought King's popular horror stories to the screen with great success . For this film his gathered a substantial cast , used computer generated graphics well , but in the end the result is a confusing mishmash of story versus sermon versus actors being overwhelmed by some really strange upstaging creatures . David Drayton ( Thomas Jane ) is a graphic artist who manages to weather a freak storm only to discover a mysterious mist hovering over his backyard lake . Going to town with his young son to get supplies at a Food Store he joins the other townsfolk in the gossip about the mist which now engulfs the town : could it be due to some experiment at the military post lab in the mountains ? The store's generator sounds like it is fumbling , and while brave David tries to fix it ( mind you , in this town with no electricity , the lights in the main store remain on . . . . ) , he sees the back wall buckling and hears a bizarre noise . Returning to the storefront , his findings are not believed - especially by the town psycho Mrs . Carmody ( Marcia Gay Harden ) who sees all things in relation to her channeling of God via her knowledge of the Book of Revelations , and the dubious out-of-towner Brent Norton ( Andre Braugher ) . But gradually David gathers some sensible folk ( Toby Jones , Chris Owen , et al ) to accompany him to the generator room and against David's warning , the back door is opened by the young stock boy and huge tentacles enter from the mist and consume the lad . Thus we have two factions : those who side with Mrs . Carmody's religious zealot need to sacrifice people to the outdoor monsters now flying about the store and those who are convinced they must fight the offenders with force and escape . The mess of a story is further confused with overlay of father / son devotion , mass hysteria , mob rule , revenge on the military for loosing these ' other world monsters ' on the public , and ' what do we do if this is the end of the earth ' . How it all winds down may satisfy some and may irritate others . So why rate this film with two stars instead of one ? Marcia Gay Harden gives a bravura performance as the crazy Mrs . Carmody and Toby Jones offers a solid representation of the stable man as a clerk in the store who keeps his wits about him . Thomas Jane is Thomas Jane , and for an action hero , he seems to melt with the circumstances . The movie is long , silly , not scary , and suffers from a weak script . For those who are entertained by this sort of story it may be worthwhile . For those who are fatigued by the same old line of good versus evil in the form of gooey huge monsters , pass on this film .

513025	3223254	460887	2.0	Pass on this Takeoff on Horror Films	Jason Paul Collum both wrote and directed this little film that resembles a gay ' Fatal Attraction ' without the benefit of a tight script , good actors , suspense , or sophisticated effects and camera work . Sadly it boils down to a fifteen-minute story spread out over an almost interminable 2 hours . The story involves on Corin ( Sean Michael Lambrecht ) , a 30-year old ad exec in a five-year bumpy relationship with 23-year old party boy Jake ( Jeff Dylan Graham ) . Corin's boss and friend Nancy ( Brinke Stevens ) understands Corin all too well , appreciates his relationship , but in attempting to relieve his work duties hires an assistant Elliot ( Jerod Howard ) , a gender confused nerdy lad who is engaged to his lifelong chum Marti ( Tina Ona Paukstelis ) in a push from his mother ( Judith O'Dea ) to make things ' right ' . Elliot is befriended by Corin , brought into Corin's and Jake's friendship , and Elliot and Marti and Corin and Jake begin socializing . Elliot falls for Corin , comes out of the closet to the extreme dismay of Marti and his mother , and despite Elliot's friendship with Corin and Jake , he begins to stalk Corin . Corin's rebuff of his advances leads to disaster and the film tumbles downhill from there . Yes , some may view this weak little foray as being full of statements about love , obsession , relationships , and friendships , but all of that has been said far better before and without the seemingly tacked on genre of a horror film . The acting from the women in the film is good , but the men are blunted stereotypes . Everything about the film screams low budget . One annoying factor - a music score that sounds like lessons on electronic keyboards and obscures a lot of the dialogue - turns out to be a blessing in that the weak script is covered frequently . Most viewers will utilize the fast forward button to get through the repetitious dialogue and race for the end , a predictable , stagy tableaux that really doesn't resolve anything . Not worth two hours of your viewing time .
513044	3223254	418819	2.0	Obviously there is an audience for this product . . . .	George A . Romero enters with yet another installment in his banal and grossly visual zombie flicks and hopefully this will be the last of them . Obviously there is an appreciative audience who enjoys watching partially decomposed bodies stomp around and grunt and eat body parts of the living because a lot of people write positively about this film . For this viewer the ' parody ' eludes . LAND OF THE DEAD is simply a dark , grotesque , poorly written , hastily thrown together bit of treacle to make money off the folks who like this genre . But how fine actors like Simon Baker , John Leguizamo , Dennis Hopper , Asia Argento , and Robert Joy agree to the casting agent's invitation to star in this film is a conundrum . Grady Harp
512699	3223254	249082	2.0	Even Diane Keaton and Paul Sorvino Can't Save this Mess !	PLAN B has the appearance of a quickly made , unedited , sloppy script for a movie with the attempt for an outing for the actors involved - an outing that should have been nixed from the start . It is just another Mafia-based ' comedy ' that has nothing new and lowers the standard for those participating . Joe Maloni ( Paul Sorvino ) is the crime boss more concerned about clothing and appearances than about his business of control . His personal assistant Mario ( Anthony DeSando ) is dumber than dirt and his ignorance is supposed to be funny . Maloni has whacked one of his debtors ( who just happens to be married to bookish Fran - Diane Keaton ) and Maloni takes Fran on as his assistant to work off her dead husband's debt by being Maloni's ' hit man ' . Fran is afraid of her own shadow and is unable to carry out Maloni's assignments , electing instead to transport her ' whackees ' to Florida to hide at her brother James ' house until she can figure out what to do next . This alternative to killing the three candidates is called Plan B , Plan A being to kill them ! The ending is wholly predictable just as is every line assigned in the script to the characters . Diane Keaton has made a lot of fine films and is one of our most talented actresses and comediennes , but here she screams and rants and twitches her way through a ridiculous part that quickly becomes annoying to watch . Paul Sorvino is , well , the Paul Sorvino type cast from other mobster films . The supporting cast is likewise allowed to play to the balcony in the broadest slapstick , pratfall fashion imaginable . What is supposed to be a comedy ends up being just silly and overdone . Director Greg Yaitanes needs to go back to TV sitcoms : had this flimsy story been compressed into a half-hour gig it might have had a chance . Grady Harp
513518	3223254	489664	3.0	A Suspenseless Suspense Movie	SHATTERED ( also known as BUTTERFLY ON A WHEEL ) is one of those films that starts out with a solid cast of highly respected actors to pull audiences in and then proceeds to squander talent in a script that should be still on the reject shelf . The film has all the markings and big budget of a major Hollywood money maker , but there is a very valid reason why the theatrical run was brief and unheralded , sending the movie to television and to DVD post haste : it just is a very weak work . Writer William Morrissey had a thought , camouflaged behind the meaning of an obscure line from Pope ( ' butterfly on a wheel ' ) that refers to the degree of torture one can take before breaking . The problem is that this tale of the consequences of infidelity has been done many , many times before with far better results . The astute viewer will find all the cracks in the plot line of this supposed ' startling thriller ' from the first few frames : watching suspicions play out is very anticlimactic . Morrissey depends on what he imaged as a ' big surprise ' ending and it just doesn't surprise ! Gerard Butler , Maria Bello , and Pierce Brosnan are all strong actors and one wonders why they opted to participate in this movie . It is not the best work of any of the three , trying to make credible characters out of the double-sided puzzle : kidnapping , testing of relationships , facing consequences of behavior . Director Mike Barker lets the drama sag when it most needs to be pushed . Unless the viewer just wants to see more of the three stars ( even in a weak film ) then that is the justification for sitting through this . Otherwise , pass . . . Grady Harp
512654	3223254	293660	3.0	And the Glitzy Martial Arts Mimics Just Go On and On	' Tian mai chuan qi ' ( AKA ' Touch ' ) follows in the well paid path of the really gorgeous films that came out of Hong Kong and China ( Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon , etc ) but it raises the question ' Just how many of these small story visual epics are palatable in repetition ? Michelle Yeoh recognizes successful financial formulas when she sees one and is at the crux of this flimsy little caper film , cashing in on the popularity of the genre . The story is slight : a relic ( ny the monks of Dan Huang . The monks call upon a family of acrobats ( of course with a history of hundreds of years of secret training on how to accomplish this mission ) to retrieve it . Pak Yin Fay ( the very beautiful Michelle Yeoh ) and her brother Tong ( Brandon Chang ) take on the mission - with a few glitches : Pak Yin Fay's old boyfriend Erik ( Ben Chaplin ) is a ne're-do-well thief who possesses the necessary Heart medallion required to open the location of the Sharira . But wouldn't you know , there appears an unscrupulous nasty guy Karl ( Richard Roxburgh , a fine Australian actor out of Moulin Rouge , The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen , Oscar and Lucinda , etc ) who causes no end of problems at the site and initiates the reason for making this film : an extended martial arts dance on pillars above a CGI fire in the tomb - a place where nearly everyone in the cast is cremated after gallant swinging and flying ! Yet of course it all ends well with the Sharira being returned to the happy monks in Tibet . Corny , yes , but if martial arts films with lots of color and vistas of deserts and the holy city in Tibet stimulate you , then this film is worth your time . Michelle Yeoh is beautiful to watch , and both Ben Chaplin and Richard Roxburgh are fine enough actors to almost make you forget the pointless shallow lines they are force to deliver with as much comedic tone as they can milk from the script .

513499	3223254	387214	3.0	Hidden Subtexts Offered in a Minimalist Film from Beijing	Zi'en Cui is a young cinematic artist producing provocative films in China , and though this venture is not wholly successful , it does show promise of a young filmmaker of cautious bravery . FEEDING BOYS , AYAYA may not be the film the DVD jacket cover suggests , but is a work that informs us of many of the current changes going on in Communist China . Essentially this is a docudrama of sorts : the idea is to follow the day to day routine of of male prostitutes in Beijing , giving insight as to why youths elect to follow this lifestyle . In order to give a feeling of story to the film , Zi'en Cui ( who not only wrote and directed but plays a pivotal role of ' composer ' ) has created a dialogue between two brothers - the older one is a virgin who is complying with the religious concept of forgoing premarital sex with his girlfriend since he is a right wing religious conservative , while the younger brother is planning to embrace the life of male prostitution . The argument for and against chastity and prostitution comprises much of the dialogue : the younger brother wants to feel the needs of the poor lower class boys who enter the city from the provinces to make money in any way they can - ' water always flows downhill ' . The older brother refuses to understand why one would defy caste just for money . Out on the streets and parks of the city the hustlers entertain each other and plan for their clients not only paying for services but also supplying wardrobes . Money ( read ' capitalism ' ) is of paramount importance . They are all constantly challenged by the bible-thumping brother , warning them that ' the end of the world is at hand ' , pleading with them to forego their occupation . The brother hands his role of evangelist to his girlfriend to continue his work . Meanwhile his younger brother embraces the life of a hustler and even brings his clients home to his parent's house for business , and despite the fact that his parents disapprove of the nature of his life , they condone the fact that at least he has a job ! One gets the feeling from the amount of dialogue that goes untranslated in the subtitles that there is a lot more to the movie than what is here outlined . It would be helpful if someone who spoke the language reviewed the film . To this viewer there are some surprising aspects of the film : coming from Communist China it is amazing that there is so much emphasis on Christianity and Capitalism , on social classes in a country whose premise is total social equality ( socialism ) , and a view of the fashion-driven , money conscious activities of the youth . There are many flaws in FEEDING BOYS , AYAYA ( whatever ' ayaya ' means ) : the camera work is pedestrian , the editing is choppy , the flow of the film is confusing , the music borders on ambient noise , the actual life of being a hustler is never truly explored ( unlike the cover photo , the only shadow of sexuality is in over-guarded bathroom scenes of boys showering and brushing teeth ! ) , and the messages of the story are so mixed that it takes much work to follow the threads . Yet given these problems , this viewer came away with some better concept of current life in Beijing - at least from the vantage of social studies . Grady Harp
513474	3223254	489070	3.0	A Hollywood Version of an Independent Creative Film : Ding !	Mario Van Peebles has done some good work in his past but this bizarre , confusing , silly dud is not one of them . The script feels like someone gave a party for wannabe writers , told them each to submit a plot for a far out film , then mixed them all together and came up with a hash that in the end is merely a re-do of the bad guy turned good guy on the run - with diversions . Lucky ( Wesley Snipes ) is released from prison with the plan of going straight . Of course his buddy covets his reputation and invites him to his birthday party where Lucky lusts after a pole dancer Angela ( Jackie Quinones ) and manages to become involved in a dirty cop drug deal that sends him on the usual wild car chase with Angela looking for a way to hideout with the corrupt money stashed in metal suitcases ( rigged of course ) . After a shootout in a motel , the couple seeks housing from a gay porno filmmaker Mendez ( Luis Guzmán in yet another chameleon role ) and his associate Antonio ( Gavin J . Behrman ) who just happens to be in on the dirty cop aspect of the drug deal . Off Lucky and Angela drive to a wooded area where they hole up next door to a weirdo pair of serial killers - Cass ( Cybill Shepherd ) , who is angry at the world for negative response to her retarded grown son Eugene ( Mike Messier ) , and Chang ( James Hiroyuki Liao ) , Cass's strangely sick lover and wannabe martial arts expert ( yeah , that is thrown in , too ) - who kidnap victims and torture and kill them in Hollywood-style videotaped sequences . Of course , when Lucky and Angela need telephone help , Lucky goes next door , is immediately strapped into a torture chair , only eventually to be discovered by the bad of bad cops and one decent cop , Captain Davis , played by Mario Van Peebles of course . And things change and intertwine and nobody really cares . Wesley Snipes does have charisma and it is because of him that the film is watchable , but even his role doesn't explain why this mess was made in the first place . It looks and sounds like a very low budget film on which probably millions were spent . Pass on this one unless you're in the mood to laugh AT a movie instead of with one . Grady Harp
512684	3223254	359013	4.0	Deliciously Silly Sequel : Laughter Returns to the Comic Books !	BLADE-TRINITY is a fantastical ride of a movie that even those of us fatigued by the larger-than-life comic book hero flicks literally poured out weekly onto the hungry theater big screens can tolerate . The production values make the most of clever weird appliances and nasty structural situations that defy reason : the animation ( vampire Pomeranian dogs , transformation costumes for Dracula AKA Drake , conflagration disintegration of human bodies by the silver tip , human blood farms , endless variations on the vampire denture appliances , etc ) is entertaining as is the copycat choreography from the CTHD ilk of films . The cast of characters has broadened , some with bit parts played by big names , others by naughty funny parts played by newcomers . Wesley Snipes has little acting to do as Blade , the daytripper semiVampire , but his presence is strong . Kris Kristofferson was plugged into the story as a non-additive cameo with Jessica Biel as his daughter , the one who leads the Blade Aides , Parker Posey is given a tour de force role as a really bad Vampirette , and yet another fine Australian import Dominic Purcell makes a handsome Drake / Dracula . But for the new viewers some of the best parts of this entertaining blood bath enter in the form of Ryan Reynolds as Hannibal King , a hunky , buff grossly under used actor with a keen sense of comic timing who can bring script lines alive with his delivery and light up the screen every time he is given the chance . This comedic touch , a tongue in cheek approach to the silly story , is taken up by all the characters but with less successful effect . Reynolds just makes it work ! You gotta be in the mood for this kind of film , but at last here is a comic book scary hero movie that is full of entertaining laughs - and that is somewhat of a first ! Grady Harp , February 06
513348	3223254	475984	5.0	Bright Moments in a Patchy Film	MISTER LONELY is that sort of film that pleads to be loved . It has an original concept for a plot , it takes many visual and surreal chances , and it is populated with a lovable cast who seem to be having fun with the process . Harmony Korine both wrote ( with Avi Korine ) and directed this pastiche about people who , frustrated with reality , live their lives as impersonators of famous people . When it works it is delightful : when it gets bogged down with a self-conscious script it falls flat . ' Mister Lonely ' ( beautifully depicted in the opening sequences under the credits as a child who cannot be what he is told to be ) is a young man who takes on the persona of Michael Jackson ( Diego Luna ) , performing dance movements on the streets of Paris as a busker . He encounters a like person who lives impersonating Marilyn Monroe ( Samantha Morton ) and before long the two are off to a Highlands commune in Scotland , populated with full time impersonators such as a foul-mouthed Abraham Lincoln ( Richard Strange ) , Charlie Chaplin ( Denis Lavant ) , The Pope ( James Fox ) , Father Umbrillo ( Werner Herzog ) , Sammy Davis , Jr . ( Jason Pennycooke ) , the current Queen Elizabeth ( Anita Palenberg ) , Little Red Riding Hood ( Rachel Korine ) , James Dean ( Joseph Morgan ) , Madonna ( Melita Morgan ) , and flying nuns among others . The story is less a plot than a celebration touched with a bit a angst of how the unnoticed people in the world find a source of belonging by embracing imagination . The film is choppy and loses some of its potential allure from the editing . The cinematography by Marcel Zyskind captures some truly beautiful moments and the musical score by Jason Spaceman with the Sun City Girls adds a lyrical air to this surreal romp . For lovers of Harmony Korine this movie will please . For viewers with limited attention spans ( running time is 112 minutes ) the film begs indulgence . Grady Harp
513656	3223254	451069	5.0	The Prodigal Son . . . with terrific music !	There is something about THE GOSPEL that makes you want to like it : some fine actors ( Boris Kodjoe , Idris Elba , Clifton Powell , Tamyra Gray , Aloma Wright , Nona Gaye ) and some really terrific gospel singing . Writer / director Rob Hardy stretches the biblical tale of the Prodigal Son to the updated story of the son of a bishop of an evangelical church who runs away to become a R & B singing star only to return to his father when cancer of the prostate signals the end of his life . The ' other ' son has inherited the mantle of the bishop with special interests deflecting his commitment to the bishop's origins and the Prodigal Son finally finds acceptance in offering his talents to further the original dream of his father . The script is conversationally pedestrian but the actors do their best to make credible characters . There is a sense of commitment from the cast of extras that leaves a warm afterglow , but in the end this is a slight story saved by some fine music . Grady Harp , January 05
513648	3223254	401385	5.0	Wrong Messages from Both Sides	Another of those ' written , directed , starring ' movies that should have been filtered through a careful producing team , SAY UNCLE will probably get an audience because of Peter Paige's fans from QUEER AS FOLK ( it looks like the entire cast and team put up the money for the production ! ) . The theme of the story is an important one - single gay men who love children are targets for homophobic people to label as sexual predators - but the film fails to engage us on both sides of the fence . Paul Johnson ( Peter Paige ) is bonded to his godson and in every way seems the perfect godfather - if a bit too much on the infantile side of maturity . His world collapses when his friends move with his godson to Japan and Paul realizes he has nothing . He loses his job , grazes on donuts , and finally begins to seek employment in kids ' stores , baby-sitting , and other kid related projects ( even trying to adopt a child while jobless ) , all the while playing with kids in the park . The mothers in the park all love the fact that he appears to be a stay-at-home dad who entertains their own children , until one mother ( Kathy Najimy ) becomes suspect that he is a pedophile and organizes the city against him . The ending is predictable and phony and doesn't say much that is good about either Paul's manner of adapting to his life needs nor the mothers ' taking responsibility for their misjudging : it just ends . Paige is a talented guy but he needs a good director to give him some insights on how to step out of clichés and stereotypes and become at least a facsimile of a real human being . Oddly enough we are left with a feeling that his ' Paul ' is a man who behaves like a child and will probably never cross the line into adulthood . The supporting cast is satisfactory but the production values are weak . The redeeming factor is the sense that everyone had a good idea to explore : the journey just doesn't compel us .
513280	3223254	468526	5.0	' Sorrow is worn out old joys '	There is a moment in this short little independent film that crystallizes the message : the camera captures the sure but almost imperceptible progress of a slug making its way across a forest leaf with all the sounds of nature as the musical background . From all of the hype that is spread across the cover of this DVD we are to believe that this is the finest independent film of the year , ' shimmering with excellence ' . Perhaps for some it will be that . The very sparse script was written by Jonathan Raymond and Kelly Reichardt ( who also directs ) , the story being a couple of days camping trip between two old friends Mark ( Daniel London ) and Kurt ( Will Oldham ) who have become estranged by circumstances : Mark has married and is expecting his first child while Kurt remains trapped in the hippie generation , meandering through life without direction . The two leave Portland , Oregon with Mark's dog and head for the Cascades where they plan to soak in the hot springs . Kurt is the navigator , manages to get them lost , then recoups and the two spend a night of discussion by a campfire followed by a day at the hot springs : they return home to their separate lives , the ' old joy ' of their previous friendship seems to remain in the past . Most of the 76 minutes of the film is silent landscapes while the two are driving . There is very little dialog and what there is seems strained by the years that separate the once hearty friendship of the two men : it seems we are to believe that the silences and spare words have great significance , but it takes more than a little patience to paste it together into a story . A few gestures are made in an attempt to connect the two again , but they fail to ignite . The acting is monochromatic , the direction is flaccid , but the beauty of the Cascades makes up for a lot . It is a simple , short , plodding little film that may please some and may ( honestly ) bore most .
512668	3223254	395429	5.0	Not Exactly What the Title Suggests . . . .	7 mujeres , un homosexual y Carlos is a misleading title , one that would indicate the possibility of a racy sexploitation movie about seven women and a homosexual involved with a guy named Carlos . This rather bland little film written and directed by Rene Bueno is anything but that . Though well photographed and cast the film never rises much above a TV novella , and for those who love the daytime soaps , then this is sure to please . Carlos ( Mauricio Ochmann ) narrates the story and informs us that he has had only one love since childhood - Camila ( Adriana Fonseca ) , a girl whose family has high hopes for their daughter . When Camila and Carlos discover Camila is pregnant at 18 the couple decide to marry , much to the disappointment of Camila's father . But marry they do , and the fun-loving relationship becomes married life with all its consequences : Camila begins revamping Carlos ' way of dressing and acting , Carlos quits school to get a job with an ad agency instead of working for Camila's father at a more lucrative position . At Carlos ' office it is de rigueur for married men to have mistresses , as is so embarrassingly pointed out when Carlos is tricked into opening the door of his boss ( Luis Felipe Tovar ) en flagrante with his secretary ( Veronica Segura ) . Also working in the office as ' office decor ' is a vampy buxom girl ( Ninel Conde ) who informs Carlos that he needs to have an affair with her . . . in order to succeed in the man's world . The slogan " Every man gets 7 women and 1 homosexual " is repeatedly used by the office staff , making the real world one that not only condones but glorifies infidelity . How this temptation is dealt with by Carlos and influences his marriage is the gist of this film . Pretty squeaky-clean . Though there are no deep moments to salvage a superficial script the movie survives on the merits of some of the cast members . It is a bit of saccharine fluff , but an OK film for a summer evening . In Spanish with English subtitles . Grady Harp
513290	3223254	467200	5.0	But it is very pretty to watch . . .	THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL suffers from overexposure to the passion for all things Tudor that has produced multiple novels , television series , and films that range from great to mediocre . Having not read Philippa Gregory's best selling novel , this viewer entered the theater without preconceived notions of the path the story would take / stray in the wake of heightened interest in historical data . From the opening scenes to the end the impression is one of having viewed some very beautiful scenery , sumptuous costumes , grand lighting - and very little involvement in caring for the plight of the characters . The soggy music score underlines the unrelenting dark atmosphere of the story and the production , and despite a cast of actors known for credibility in historic roles , there is little compassion stirred . King Henry VIII ( Eric Bana , in relatively little screen time ) tires of Katherine of Aragon ( Ana Torent ) and her inability to bear a male heir . The Boleyn clan ( Mark Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas in collusion with the Duke of Norfolk David Morrissey ) seize on Henry's frustration and serve up their daughters Anne ( Natalie Portman ) and Mary ( Scarlett Johansson ) to satisfy his dalliances . The younger Mary beds him first , produces a daughter ( Elizabeth ) , then falls our of favor leaving Anne to works her newly honed skills of feminism learned in her exile to France on the easily seduced King . The results are tension in the castle , in the Boleyn family , and between the sisters Anne and Mary . History is molded by the writer to maintain more of a Hollywood soap opera that a recreation of fact and it all ends with beheadings and the child Elizabeth running gaily through sunny old meadows of England . The actors all try to make us buy into this version of betrayal and lust and loathing , but the dialog ( written by Peter Morgan ) is tired and used and anything but in keeping with the period . But then , the movie is a collection of scenes that are very pretty to watch . . . Justin Chadwick directs . Grady Harp
512936	3223254	376196	5.0	The Title Describes the Content	SLOW BURN is a film that has much to like , much promise , and a cast of trusty actors to bring it off . The problem with the result is in director / writer Wayne Beach's hands and especially in the editing job on the completed film . It is like watching a ' follow-the-bouncing-ball ' film : there are many surprises and subplots and altered identities that keeping a score card of where the story is going is a bit difficult . Reduced to the bare bones the plot takes place in a 24 hour period during which District Attorney Ford Cole ( Ray Liotta ) and his Assistant DA Nora ( Jolene Blalock ) are in a showdown with a significant crime boss Luther Pinks ( LL Cool J ) . Nothing is as it seems , as irritating flashbacks attempt to prove , and in the end the good guys and the bad guys are difficult to appreciate . There are some excellent performances by reliable actors such as Taye Diggs , Mekhi Phifer , Chiwetel Ejiofor , and Bruce McGill , but the plot depends on a significant point of the confused racial identity of Jolene Blalock's character , and though she acts well , the part would have been better served by an actress like Nicole Ari Parker , to name just one . The problem with this supposedly enigmatic thriller is that the astute viewer will see through the plot far too early . But given the quibbles , it is good to see these actors at work , especially the underused Ray Liotta . Grady Harp
512812	3223254	418763	6.0	Significance ? JARHEAD depicts the Bizarre DESERT STORM War	Were intentions graded instead of product , then JARHEAD would be given 4 stars rather than 3 , merely because it is one of the few films ( so far ) that shows the particular idiosyncrasies of that first Bush war , the DESERT SHIELD transforming into DESERT STORM . We have many films that document the mindset of the soldiers from the Civil War through the two World Wars , to Korean War to Vietnam War and each is different . JARHEAD is as much about the changes that have occurred in the American military with the advent of computerized warfare and sophisticated war machines and weapons as it is about the Greed for Oil Dominance that prompted the US Kuwaiti involvement . And for that this film is important and will remain so until something better comes along . The story is rather minimal and as narrated by the author of the novel on which it is based , Anthony Swofford ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) , it takes a while to become airborne . Swoff is a disillusioned kid who can't figure out how to make life meaningful so he opts for the USMC as a staging zone in his growth . What he discovers is the usual boot camp mentality and training , encountering other men who have both similar and different reasons for joining the Corps : Troy ( Peter Saarsgard ) has dark issues that remain with him throughout the story ; Kruger ( Lucas Black ) opted for the Corps instead of prison ; Cortez ( Jacob Vargas ) needed money to support his pregnant wife ; Cuban immigrant Escobar ( Laz Alonso ) sincerely is a grateful patriot , etc . Along the way the boys encounter the stereotype DI ( Scott MacDonald ) , the Staff Sergeant ( Jamie Fox ) and the company commander Lt Col Kazinski ( Chris Cooper ) as well as the usual variety of testosterone provoked young kids successfully brainwashed to be ' fighting men ' . The bulk of the story after boot camp is the boredom of going to war in the Kuwaiti desert , having nothing at all to do except play dumb games and wait and hydrate , until at last the Staff Sergeant gleefully announces Saddam Hussein is shooting and they are off to actually do what they were trained to do - Fight ! But even that is thwarted as they wade through a miserable existence of seeing sky-darkened oil well fires , constant oil raining from the burning oil money holes , losing buddies to friendly fire and mistaken attacks by their own air support . And just at the point when this company of trained snipers ( especially Swoff and Troy ) gets the chance to kill , the ' war ' is over and they go home . And in Swofford's narrative comments he notes how those men will never be allowed to leave the desert experience behind . ' Wars are different , yet wars are the same ' . Jake Gyllenhaal , buffed and shaved headed , gives us everything Swoff represents - as far as the meager script and misguided direction by Sam Mendes allow . He is a fine actor and his range of emotions is what holds the film together . The remainder of the cast likewise does their best to make their shadowy character outlines from the screenplay by William Broyles Jr . as close to three-dimensional as the lines allow . Yes , the film is about a new kind of soldier , one less driven by patriotism and more informed about the commercial greed that drives these fiascoes , and Mendes does allow us to see that . But deeper character development and motivation could have made this a more powerful antiwar statement than a visual excursion of life under the sun of the foreign desert skies . Grady Harp
513455	3223254	380599	6.0	A Visually Stunning but Emotionally Uninvolving Oliver Twist	Charles Dickens ' famous story of the perseverance of the individual in the crumbling society of poverty in mid 19th century London has been scripted for film many times : the catalogue lists 19 versions and that doesn't include some films using the matrix of the story only . The results are variably successful : David Lean's 1948 version is brilliant , Renny Rey's 4 part mini series in 1999 was good , Tony Bill's TV film in 1999 had the flavor , the musical version ' Oliver ! ' was a resounding success , and even Jacob Tierney's ' Twist ' from 2003 with the pickpockets as male hustlers had its magic moments . Now here comes Roman Polanski with yet another adaptation of the warhorse novel , and while there are many fine aspects of this version , there are many problems that seem to be overlooked . Polanski creates a visual masterpiece of England and especially London of 1850 , opting for sepia and brown tones to give the dark film a sense of the muck and filth that were de rigueur in that time of dirt streets and horse drawn carriages . His sets do appear to be backstage constructions but they offer the right atmosphere . There are some fine actors involved , especially Ben Kingsley as one of the more successful Fagin interpreters . But somewhere along the line Polanski let the scenery and costumes take over and the screenplay and direction offer us the shell outline of the story but the fine actors are not given the opportunity to become fleshed out adequately to allow us to really care about them . At 130 minutes the film seems to drag and to lack attention to character development , but it is a visual treat . The ingredients are all here but somehow the cake didn't rise . As with Dickens ' novel , Oliver Twist needs to tug at our hearts : this one just doesn't . Grady Harp
512811	3223254	274847	6.0	A Gritty Drama from an Innovative Mexican Director	Mexican writer / director Leopoldo Laborde has made a number of low budget , challenging , controversial films , using his cadre of nonprofessional actors and crew and he is gathering a following for his courage and his unique style . SIN DESTINO is a good introduction to his work - a film about the seamy side of Mexico City's life told with verismo style that at times is difficult to watch but yet one that succeeds in conveying his story well . Using a combination of black and white with intervals of color photography , SIN DESTINO follows the life of a fifteen-year old Francisco / Frank ( Francisco Rey ) who has been a sex worker since his desperate introduction to the desires of older men when he was nine years old . He regularly engages in same sex activity for money to pay for a drug habit that is out of control . His friend and dealer is the understanding David ( David Valdez ) who ' loans ' Frank money and coke when Frank is desperate , but also feels the need to get Frank out of the sex market by introducing him to women : David believes that once Frank has sex with a woman he will forego his street ways and have a chance at life . Frank happens to view a blonde girl Angelica ( Mariana Gaja ) and for the first time feels attraction to women . David sets Frank up with a kind-hearted prostitute Perla ( Sylvia Vilchis ) who offers Frank understanding and tenderness even though Frank is unable to perform . Frank has disturbing dreams and visions of his initial initiation into the male hustler life by an older child pornographer Sebastian ( Roberto Cobo ) and these intensely ugly memories are mixed with his delusions of sexual encounters with Angelica : these scenes appear in color and make a fine contrast in the ' magical realism ' vein . David encourages Frank to bed Angelica and sells him ( through money he will retrieve from an incidental reunion with Sebastian ) a love potion that will assure his sexual success with Angelica . Frank visits Sebastian after a six-year absence , obtains the money through violent means , and has his desired hook up with Angelica that results in a cruel tragedy that completes the film . David remains at Frank's side through the sequelae that follow and the film ends on a dark note that all but extinguishes Frank's hope for a favorable destiny . Laborde knows what he wants and opts for a crude , rough , seemingly spontaneous non-rehearsed style of acting from his crew . He is able to draw from Francisco Rey an empathetic character , a lad who is stuck in the quagmire of the slim that faces the poor kids of the big city . Laborde is even able to make his ' evil johns ' such as Sebastian more than simply dark caricatures . His cinematographer Jorge Rubio Casarín is at all times in sync with Laborde's vision , even though the camera use is inordinately distracting with its play of light and dark at times . It is only after the film is over that Laborde's use of the fate , death and love potion motifs from Wagner's ' Tristan und Isolde ' are appreciated , and that is an example of how much energy the writer / director has in his visions , a trait that suggests he may become a significant force in Mexican film-making . The film contains considerable violence , nudity , simulated sex scenes , drug use and harsh language , but one cannot imagine this story being told without those elements .

513033	3223254	479537	6.0	Revenge and the Wilderness Struggle for Survival	SERAPHIM FALLS is an odd film , one that on the surface appears to be an homage to the old Westerns , but proves to be a psychological battle for survival between two men engulfed in revenge . There is very little story to relate : Carver ( Liam Neeson ) with a small posse of bounty hunters ( Michael Wincott , Ed Lauter , John Robinson and Robert Baker ) treks Gideon ( Pierce Brosnan ) through snow , forests , mountains , rough water , and desert over a Civil Ear seed of hate . The ' story ' fades to a philosophical stance ( somewhat clumsily ) by the intervention of some ghostly creatures ( Anjelica Huston , et al ) and ends without much more than a whisper of a memory about the futility of revenge . Bronson and Neeson do well with their scant dialogue , revealing more of their character's minds with physical action and the power of facial expressions . The mood of the film is in the superior hands of cinematographer John Toll and Harry Gregson-Williams ' musical score . Director David Von Ancken keeps the tension at peak level even though the film is desperately in need of editing ( just under tow long hours in length ) . But for a diversion and an appreciation for the wilderness of America in the mid-nineteenth century , SERAPHIM FALLS is a visually satisfying experience . Grady Harp
513397	3223254	416315	6.0	A Grisly Cinematic Depiction of a Terrifying Tale !	WOLF CREEK may not be a film for everyone to see , certainly not children , but if you're up for a taste of the macabre then this well made horror movie is certain to please . The most terrifying aspect of the story is that it is based on true incidents , incidents in Australia that carry the same degree of impact as the Manson murders or the Hillside Strangler . Murder and Madness are well married . A lively group of young daring travelers decide to take a camping trip to explore some fascinating regions of Australia , such as the crater site that is one of the largest in the world . We get to know lovable Ben ( Nathan Phillips ) and spunky Liz ( Cassandra Magrath ) and Kristy ( Kestie Morassi ) as they set out on the highway for an adventure only to backpack into one of their destinations and return to find their car won't start and their watches have stopped . A friendly older gent Mick ( John Jarret ) stops to give them a hand and tows them to his ranch - and the story really begins . In continued scenes of seat-grabbing terror each of the three discover just how evil Mick is , and each is taken captive in different ways , tortured and well , to tell more would be to destroy the plot . Director Greg McLean takes his time in the first portion of the film , leading us to believe that this may be just another outback road trip with love interests , humor , and minor conflicts . But when he introduces Mick he alters the look and the style of the film , opting for some of the most magnificent vistas of Australia as the background for some of the more grisly depictions of horror on film . The camera work ( Will Gibson ) is terrific and the musical score by Frank Tetaz adds to the mix of terror and madness . The actors all turn in fine performances : Nathan Phillips is a welcome new persona on the screen and John Jarret becomes one of the most realistic and repulsive of bad guys ever created on film . As long as you know what you're in for , this is a fast moving scary movie that will hold you to your seat and make you check your doors and windows for closure before going to bed ! Grady Harp
512779	3223254	397103	6.0	A Worthy Little Message Story Stretched to the Limits	SMILE is one of those Op-Ed moments on CNN that can be told with poignant dignity in 10 - 15 minutes and make a significant impact . The trouble with SMILE , the motion picture , is that it stretches this idea into 107 padded minutes , incorporating far more sitcom TV dialog about wealthy families with strident children looking for ways to escape uninspiring parental role models with teenage sex life and outside causes . It takes so long for this movie to get going that it loses the viewer . The strong elements lie in the concept of the parallel of two girls born on the same day , one to the wealthy Malibu family with everything but concord , an the other left as an unwanted deserted orphan because of a facial deformity , salvaged by a caring worker who raises her as his own . The stories run parallel through the teen years when the Western girl seeks meaning to life by joining a humanitarian medical group whose efforts are directed toward offering the Eastern girl a chance at a normal appearance . The comparison of the lives of the two girls and their disparate families is tender and meaningful and that alone is worth the effort to tell this tale . The actors are very good for the most part - Sean Astin in his most mature role to date , Mika Boorem as the Western girl and Yi Ding as the Eastern girl , and Beau Bridges and Luoyong Wang as the apposing fathers , Linda Hamilton as a rather tiresome mother , and some good young actors in supporting parts . The cinematography in China is very lovely but there is little tie in with the California counterpart . Jeffrey Kramer directs with less hold on pacing than on commitment to a worthwhile tale begging for brevity . Grady Harp
513270	3223254	796375	6.0	An Out of Focus Story But Very Well Told	Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have had success with such collaborations as ' The Chronicles of Narnia ' and ' The Life and Death of Peter Sellers ' , proving their skills , and yet in this strange amalgam of serious versus romantic versus dark comedy they have created a series of vignettes loosely tied together and named it YOU KILL ME . The film as directed by John Dahl ( aided by a superb cluster of fine actors ) almost works despite itself , but in the end the audience is left wondering just what the purpose of the fragmented nature of the story was ! The story begins in Buffalo , NY where the Irish gang is coercing the Chinese gang to join forces against the rapidly diminishing Polish gang . The head man for the Polish is Roman Krzeminski ( Philip Baker Hall ) aided by Stef Czyprynski ( Marcus Thomas ) both of whom rely on their hit man Frank Falenczyk ( Ben Kingsley ) - an aging alcoholic who lately has had too many missed or messy deaths because of his constant state of inebriation . Roman feels the pinch as Irish gang leader Edward O'Leary ( Dennis Farina ) escapes being snuffed by Frank , and Frank is sent to San Francisco to dry out and shape up . In San Francisco , Frank is monitored by Dave ( Bill Pullman ) who finds Frank a job in a funeral home making up corpses and forces Frank into AA meetings . Gradually Frank gets sober , only to meet a woman Laurel ( Téa Leoni ) who is also a bit beaten by her own demons . They form a fragile and odd relationship , each for some reason feeling the need to mutually open up - a new experience for both . Frank's AA sponsor Tom ( Luke Wilson ) adds to the growing away from alcohol process and also aids Frank in his attraction to Laurel . Lapses into booze occur and Frank finally feels he is a failure and returns to Buffalo to resume his ' work ' , but to his surprise , the changes that occurred in San Francisco follow him - in a good way . Even with the Cuisinart-blended fragments of a story , the cast is so strong that the film works . Kingsley is convincing , Leoni is superb , and the rest of the ensemble rises to the occasion with the little screen time they are given . And while the movie feels like a spoof on AA meetings and a spoof on organized crime and on funeral parlor secrets , in the end it seems like a fairly solid love story - albeit a weird one . YOU KILL ME is an acquired taste . Grady Harp
512723	3223254	826711	6.0	An Extemporaneous Homage to Albert Lamorisse's THE RED BALLOON	Somewhere the highly regarded Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-Hsien had the idea of paying homage to the 1956 classic Albert Lamorisse film THE RED BALLOON , a tender story of a child's interaction with a nearly animate floating balloon , and while there is indeed an short introduction of a small boy addressing an errant red balloon floating in Paris , the ' homage ' stops there . What follows is an overly long , frustratingly impromptu series of scenes that lack cohesion and resolution . THE FLIGHT OF THE RED BALLOON ( Le Voyage du balloon rouge ) is a prolonged ( 113 minutes ) series of scenes that stutter along with the same sort of wandering course of the occasionally visible red balloon to present moments in the life of a disheveled , frumpy , single mother Suzanne ( Juliette Binoche ) whose income depends on her fascination and obsession with Chinese marionette presentations for which she supplies the backstage voice for all of the characters . Her absent ' husband / boyfriend ' has left her to write in Montreal while Suzanne must care for her young son Simon ( Simon Iteanu ) with the help of a newly hired Taiwanese photographer nanny Song ( Fang Song ) while her daughter resides in Brussels . This disheveled household is further complicated by the freeloading Marc ( Hippolyte Girardot ) , the friend of her absentee ' husband ' , by Simon's piano lessons taught by Anna ( Anna Sigalevitch ) , and by impossible conflicting schedules for marionette performances , partially relieved by Song's quiet ability to take Simon on adventures outside the confines of the cluttered little space they all call home . The only quieting element of this film is the occasional appearance of the ' guardian angel ' red balloon , which seems to be a symbol for defining the real world of Simon and the illusory world he craves . The dialogue as written by Hou and François Margolin is choppy and the camera work and constant meandering piano music seem extemporaneous : there are few resolutions to the individual stories that are only hinted . Juliette Binoche is a solid actress able to make the most of a minimal script and horrendous costuming and makeup : her moments of being the voice of marionettes are magical . But this Red Balloon just doesn't take flight in the context of this homage . As with the rest of the film the balloon just floats off at the end . The viewer needs a lot of patience with this film !

513329	3223254	134033	6.0	Sometimes Silly Is What You Want !	PLUNKETT & MACLEANE has a purpose : entertainment . And during a season of rush and deadlines this little film provides enough anachronistic pleasures to fill a relaxing evening . The story is simple : two social polar opposites with reasons for distaste for society join forces to rob the rich . And all the rest is fantasy and period tongue in cheek humor . Jonny Lee Miller is the cleaner of the two and Robert Carlyle the scruffy intuitive thief . The two fall under different influences piloted by such fine actors as Liv Tyler , Alan Cumming , and Michael Gambon . This is high rolling farce with a silly but fun musical score and wonderful period costumes and mannerisms . It is not deep , it is not particularly good , but it IS entertaining . This kind of fluff leaves you whistling with a smile . Grady Harp
513412	3223254	209933	7.0	All the ingredients of a superb film . . . just not mixed yet !	BEAU TRAVAIL is a curious film . It is based on the story ' Billy Budd ' by Herman Melville and on the operatic adaptation by EM Forster of Benjamin Britten's magnificent BILLY BUDD and has all the right pieces in place to make a fine , updated adaptation of the story . Unfortunately the script fails to find the message of the story and so there is much correct atmosphere but little character development . The original story revolves around a warship ( The Rights o ' Man ) in the French and English war that takes on recruits while at sea . The Captain relates the story of how he was forced to hang the magnificently beautiful and loved new recruit Billy Budd because of an accidental death in part due to Budd's fatal flaw - his stammer . The Master at Arms notices Billy from the beginning as a creature of physical beauty and there is a strong physical attraction to the lad . Unable to cope with his feelings , the Master at Arms plots for the downfall of the object of his desire and lust and it is his manipulation that results in Billy's hanging , nearly causing a mutiny by Billy's shipmates . Billy is a Parsifal character - a ' guileless fool ' , who even in his sentencing to death still blesses the Captain of the ship . All well and good . The film here transplants much of this tale to a Foreign Legion outpost in Africa , and much of the above is insinuated . The appropriation is so complete that portions of Britten's opera BILLY BUDD are used to set scenes . But there the magic stops . The ' master at arms ' does not seem to desire the beautiful recruit but for some unexplained reason seeks to have him gone . Such a shame . It is as though the writer wanted to avoid homosexual overtones of the original and as a result the characters have no where to go . All of the actors are good , the scenery is bleak ( a desert here instead of the bleak sea of the original ) and appropriate , the music is an eclectic mix that works . All the ingredients are here to make a fine film , but it just doesn't come off . The director needed to see the old film version of Billy Budd starring Terrence Stamp to see that pitting the evil , sadistic , lusty master at arms against the virile , sensitive and good young man can and does work well .
513730	3223254	415778	7.0	A Fast Paced Action Thriller That's Not All That Bad !	Viewers seem to be pretty much against this action flick , seeming to put it down because if IS an action flick , a fact that for this viewer prevents looking for the good parts of a movie that succeeds in making us think . Director Andy Cheng ( also a co-writer for the script ) has a background as a movie stunt coordinator and that talent serves him well in this fast paced , explosive , interesting film . Alex Thomas ( Cuba Gooding , Jr . ) is a secret agent assigned to the President when an assassination occurs : Thomas takes a bullet for his beloved President ( Jack Scalia ) and comforts the First Lady ( Anne Archer ) when the President is pronounced dead . Thomas works for Head Agent Vaughn Stevens ( James Woods ) who comforts the grieving Thomas and sends him off duty to recover : Thomas goes off on a drinking binge and is discovered by an aggressive Pulitzer Prize news reporter Kate Crawford ( Angie Harmon ) and between the two of them they uncover a conspiracy that involves top ranking people . The perpetrator of the assassination is one Jack Baldwin ( Peter Greene ) who guides the events from is hidden space . Every lead Crawford uncovers is promptly destroyed by explosions or fires until the final confrontation of Baldwin with Thomas and Crawford . And just when the viewer thinks every step is utterly predictable , the ending leaves the truth about the assassination to the viewer . . . ! Cuba Gooding , Jr . is a fine talent in search of a great role : in this film he does well underplaying his character with some of the subtleties that demonstrate more of his talent . Angie Harmon delivers a fine performance : she deserves more roles . Anne Archer remains a pleasure to watch , even in this small but pivotal role , and James Woods , James Selby , and to an extent the grossly disfigured , post multiple plastic surgeries Burt Reynolds create credible characters . This is not a great movie , but is certainly is one with some fine elements and offers promise for new director Andy Cheng in his stepped up role . Yes , it is a bit predictable until the end , but it is a far better film than many of the movies that had the experience of a theatrical run ( this one went straight to DVD ! ) . Worth an evening's watching . Grady Harp
512643	3223254	475944	7.0	Witch Hunting in the 21st Century : Hunky Molochs !	THE COVENANT is not a great film by any definition but it is worth seeing for the cast of characters doomed to portray the rather shoddy script : the live Abercrombie & Fitch appearing models make up for allure in screen presence what they may lack in a solid story . In the 1600s , during the witch trials , there were five families who secretly survived , holding ' The Power ' , to send their descendants into the future . It is now present time and four of the families are represented by young hunks , the Ipswich Guys , who are attending a private school in autumnal Massachusetts , careful to keep their Power hidden for the most part : the Power is the ability to do fantastic feats of force and sorcery which , if it is used to much carries the punishment of aging the body quickly . . . The four lads are Caleb ( 20-year old stud model Steven Strait ) , Pogue ( sculpted body man Taylor Kitsch ) , Tyler ( Chace Crawford ) , and Reid ( Toby Hemingway ) and aside from Caleb and Pogue the other two are pretty much set decoration , so minimal are their lines and involvement . Into this setting comes one Chase Collins ( Sebastian Stan , a handsome lad from ' The Architect ' ) who just happens to be the surviving member of the fifth family and who is greedy for Power beyond his own abilities . A series of confrontations results in Caleb facing Chase in a showdown , but not before the girls involved with the good guys - Caleb's girlfriend Sarah ( Laura Ramsey ) and Pogue's girlfriend Kate ( Jessica Lucas ) , equally as beautiful as their partners are handsome - critically enter the picture . There is , of course , a showdown in an old ancestral barn during the requisite thunder and lightning storm background which serves as a stage for the silly computer generated graphics that throw Caleb and Chase around with jellyfish balls and the like . The ending makes it very clear that a sequel ( probably more than one ) is planned and if that means more exposure for this attractive young cast of actors , bring it on . Director Renny Harlin and writer J . S . Cardone know they have a kitschy formula movie and seem to have a great time making it as fun and creepy as possible - good music , great lighting and camera work , and a penchant for locker room shower scenes that guarantee success with the intended audience . THE COVENANT is often silly but it is a good escapist movie and may just be the springboard for some new faces ! Grady Harp
513163	3223254	470715	7.0	Finding Self Through Flashbacks and Fragments	' Comme un frère ' ( Like a Brother ) is a brief film by writers and directors Bernard Alapetite and Cyril Legann that succinctly examines the development of identity of a young lad over a period of less than a year . The technique of telling the story of the coming of sexual age of a boy is one that may confuse some viewers - the present is combined with the past in a patchwork manner , the only key that the past is the subject is the use of near monochrome film color that successfully suggests the blur that past events now faded affect the senses - becomes one of the more unique aspects of this little French film . The story opens in Paris where young Sébastien / AKA Zack ( Benoît Delière ) sits in a café with his current boyfriend Bruno ( Johnny Amaro ) and lets it be known that it is his birthday . Bruno's questioning as to why Sébastien is not in a celebratory mood begins flashbacks of a year ago when Sébastien lived in the small coastal town of La Baule where he doted on his best friend Romain ( Thibault Boucaux ) . Despite Romain's devotion and physical closeness to Sébastien , Romain is in love with Sophie ( Amandine Maugy ) whose best friend Marine ( Adeline Ishiomin ) is trying to attract the love interest of Sébastien . The four are close , but something is missing : Sébastien loves Romain and while the two have some beautifully tender moments together , Romain is not the gay boy Sébastien needs . Sébastien leaves his provincial town for Paris , connects with his father ( Michel Derville ) and confides his true identity as a gay young man . His father is warmly supportive and suggests Sébastien move in with him . Sébastien ( now called ' Zack ' ) begins to visit clubs and eventually is absorbed into the gay life , yet he still dreams of Romain . After months pass and Zack is in a comfortable relationship ( Patrick Esilva ) , Romain comes to Paris and the two now young men meet in a park - but where will this new reunion lead ? The actors are for the most part very fine - especially Thibault Boucaux and Adeline Ishiomin - and the sensual aspects of the story are well captured with restraint . With a running time of only 55 minutes the story flies past the eyes much in the way memories bounce in the psyche and it is this manner that makes the story fresh . There should be more to come from the creators and certainly from some of the fine new actors in this film . In French with English subtitles . Grady Harp
513453	3223254	408790	7.0	The Subtleties of Building Atmosphere	FLIGHTPLAN as directed by Robert Schwentke from a screenplay by writers Peter A . Dowling and Billy Ray is excellent on creating tension from the first frames of the film well into the uni-set stage of an impossibly huge airplane . Little things like scenes of isolation , snow , ice , coffins - all set the viewer up for a thriller . Atmosphere 5 , story 3 . The plot is so well known from other reviews that it merits no re-hash here . But the ' driven mother ' against the free-floating anxiety of air travel and espionage in the post-911 is what keeps this film airborne . If the viewer can appreciate the possibilities of how even a scientific mind like that of aeronautics engineer Kyle ( Jodie Foster ) can splinter in the days following the death of her husband coupled with the added emotional burden of helping her child understand death , coffins , terror etc then the story will be gripping . The performances are fine - especially Foster in yet another superfemale role , but also Peter Sarsgaard , Sean Bean , and the supporting cast and crew of the beleaguered icy airplane . At some point , however , the atmosphere must support a solid , intelligent story , one that is without holes in credibility , if it is to rate high on the Terror / Thriller / Suspense factor . The cinematography and musical score both support the director's vision . FLIGHTPLAN tries very hard but ends up feeling like a sellout somewhere along the line . Grady Harp
512879	3223254	449588	7.0	An Intrigue Drama from Life	HUNT FOR JUSTICE is a Canadian television drama that has made it to DVD and that is reason for gratitude for those who hunger for educational dramas that inform us about facts of current history that somehow get buried in the media . The film is not a Hollywood production , it relies heavily on footage from court files , but it also introduces to many of us the act of heroism of Louise Arbour in bringing about the trial of Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic . Louise Arbour ( veteran Canadian actor Wendy Crewson ) is a Canadian judge appointed by NATO as the Chief War Crimes Prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague . The film begins in 1996 when Arbour travels to The Hague to face the political obstacles that are preventing the Tribunal to bringing to justice the war criminals in the war Yugoslavia has been waging in Serbia , Croatia , and Bosnia , a war that has gross evidence of crimes against humanity in the form of genocide , extermination camps , and other heinous abuses . The progress toward bringing the criminals to justice is hampered by generals ( including one played by William Hurt ) who fear a major World War if precautions against same are infringed upon . Arbour , with the keen help of her translator Pasko Odsak ( Stipe Erceg ) , her staff including Keller ( Heino Ferch ) and the unexpected assistance from British Capt . John Tanner ( John Corbett ) , forges ahead , focusing the impossible task of bringing all responsible parties to justice on three specific events . Two of the three top suspects are captured but during their trials each meets his end . This leaves only Slobodan Milosevic himself , and Arbour and her colleagues are successful in bringing the war criminal to justice in 1999 . There are several touching side plots employed in the telling of this well-documented tale , stories that make the point in history more personal . Some may find the film footage of corpses and prisoners and death camps too strong to watch , but they are necessary to bring home the purpose of the film . Wendy Crewson carries the power to drive the message home - the message that war crimes must never go unpunished . There is much current history to be learned from this film : writers Ian Adams , Riley Adams and M . A . Lovretta have condensed the information and made it dramatic as well . Director Charles Binamé balances the docudrama with the story progress , never forgetting that he has a tale of intrigue to tell as well . HUNT FOR JUSTICE is worth watching ! Grady Harp
513255	3223254	71219	7.0	Some Insights into the Creative Process of David Hockney	Jack Hazan's quasi-documentary A BIGGER SPLASH is an unfocused examination about the creative life of David Hockney and supposedly about the effect of his past relationship with his pupil Peter Schlesinger ( an artist , sculptor , and photographer who Hockney not only enjoyed as a lover but as a disciple ) . The précis appears to be that Hockney , in the throes of disappointment about the dissolution of his affair with Peter , decides to move to California where he has already been established as a painter of California people and places . In London we meet his friends - Celia Birtwell , the elegantly stylishly beautiful model Hockney used repeatedly , dress designer Ossie Clark , confidant Mo McDermott , and patron Henry Geldzahler - each of whom Hockney painted and drew . We watch as Hockney visits the galleries and admires works of his friends , how he paints in his studio , how he relates to his gallerists ( like Paul Kasmin ) , and how he perceives men and other artists . Peter Schlesinger figures prominently in the film with many episodes of Peter's swimming in the pools of the people Hockney would eventually immortalize . He is a fine presence and carries his silent role well - almost appearing as a ghost muse that keeps Hockney focused on his now infamous swimming pool paintings . The magic of this film , for those to whom Hockney is a well known and important painter , is the visual recreation of the paintings that have made him so famous : we are allowed to see Celia and her husband with white cat in context with the canvas , the view of Peter staring into the pool at an under water swimmer , the woman and her animal heads who appears in another of Hockney's famous paintings at poolside , etc . This kind of cinematic background is valuable now and will prove invaluable to the archives of David Hockney . For those people this is a must-see film , despite its meandering technique and choppy editing . For others , it may seem too self-indulgent .
513353	3223254	432402	7.0	Revisiting the 1960s : Was it really that strange ?	FACTORY GIRL is a film that divides viewers into those who love it and those who dismiss it as trivial trash . For this reviewer there are some strong points in this film about an almost indescribable time in our history that helps clarify points about Andy Warhol and his significance on the art scene . And one of those points is made more clear by the film's refusal to make Warhol the central character . This is Edie Sedgwick's story and it is told in a manner compatible with the times in which it took place . Director George Hickenlooper , using a story / screenplay by Aaron Richard Golub , Captain Mauzner and Simon Monjack , elects to tell this pseudo-biopic in the form of interviews and flashbacks , beginning with an interview of the makeup-less Edie Sedgwick ( Sienna Miller ) speaking to a reporter in a hospital , some time after her extended 15 minutes of fame . Edie was a wealthy beautiful but psychologically and physically damaged art student from am important , albeit extraordinarily dysfunctional , family an escaped to New York where she was taken in by the newly fashionable Pop artist Andy Warhol ( Guy Pearce ) and made a member of his bizarre family who lived in The Factory . Warhol made films ( probably some of the worst ever made . . . ) and promised fame to Edie . But Edie spent all her wealth on parties and drugs and broken promises of fame , fell in love with an unnamed folk singer ( Hayden Christensen - very shallowly imitating Dylan Thomas ) , and eventually fell out with the world and into the realm of drug addiction . All the while Andy Warhol remained the enigmatic weird artist whose relationship to the world was distorted at best . The films walks through some raunchy scenes , some glimpses of Warhol's infamous silkscreens of pop objects , and offers a chance for a fairly secure cast of actors to draw some of the people who lived in the factory - actors including Jack Huston , Jimmy Fallon , Shawn Hatosy , Mena Suvari - and those who were outside the ' temple ' - actors such as James Naughton , Beth Grant , Edward Hermann and Ileana Douglas as Diana Vreeland . Yes , there are holes in the script and the film feels like a bad hangover at times , but for this viewer the acting of Sienna Miller and Guy Pearce make the film worthwhile . This is not a pretty story but it is an informative one about the depravity of the 1960s and the lasting effects ( both bad and good ) on art and society . Grady Harp
513667	3223254	372784	8.0	A Comic Book Hero Transformed into a Credible Hero	Not at all being one for the comic book fantasies that continue to flood the screens and gobble the dollars , camouflage weak scripts with tacky overblown computer graphics , introduce bizarre meanies and barely clothed wonder women , etc , I approached this BATMAN BEGINS with a big bag of prejudices . And in no time at all that bag of unjustified prejudices began to fill with applause for a truly fine film that carries style , wit , character , and enough dazzle to please everyone . This is a surprising good movie ! It takes courage to move a larger than life fantasy hero into the realm of humans who through reasons of their own feel the need to become superheroes to the down and outers of the world . Watching the early life of Batman as produced and trained and stimulated by believable characters makes the non-believer want to return to the earlier forays into the genre . So very much of the success of this film lies in the hands of a brilliant cast : Christian Bale ( once again a hunk after his pathetically shriveled body in ' The Machinist ' ) , Liam Neeson , Michael Caine , Linus Roache , Morgan Freeman , Tom Wilkinson , Gary Oldman , Cillian Murphy and yes , even Katie Holmes ( ! ) all master the tightrope of parody , serious drama , and comedy . The costumes and cinematography are exciting and the direction by Christopher Nolan is pitch perfect . It is good to have a dusty old bag of prejudices fall apart . Maybe there will be more action hero movies that take themselves seriously as an art form ! Grady Harp
513293	3223254	795368	8.0	Hilarious Romp Through Unlikely Subject Material	Like so many others this viewer waited for the DVD release of DEATH AT A FUNERAL , thinking that a comic take on a potentially morbid subject might not be very entertaining . Couldn't have been more wrong ! This is the kind of humor the Brits do so well - intelligent , expertly delivered dialog and action that can make even the most unlikely situations hilarious . Writer Dean Craig and Director Frank Oz have created a farce and have put this tongue in cheek situation in the hands of some the best of the British actors . The result is a spinning top that only gradually allows the viewer to breath from laughing during the clever final credits . The father of a very dysfunctional family has died and son Daniel ( Matthew MacFadyen ) and his wife Jane ( Keeley Hawes ) have agreed to host the funeral . After the mortuary first delivers the wrong corpse the tone is set for all the wrong things to happen . The arriving family is a bizarre clan of characters - a novelist living beyond his means in New York ( Rupert Graves ) , a man who unwittingly mistakes an hallucinogen for Valium and ends up on a trip that entertains all , a ' drug distributor ' , a crotchety old man with toilet problems , and the usual stuffy and goofy associates that so often populate the British comedies . And when it seems as though little else could support sanity , up pops a figure form the US ( Peter Dinklage ) with a secret about the deceased and proceeds to cause a situation that becomes the focal point of this zany funeral . Saying too much about each of the characters diminishes the surprises that abound . Were it not for the fact that each of the actors in the film is ' top drawer ' this little movie could have become mawkish or tasteless , but this cast and director have produced one of the most refreshingly funny films of the past year .

513228	3223254	95690	8.0	One of the Old Standards	It's hard to believe that this little 1988 film has endured in popularity for so long . It is a simple story of three ' sisters ' in the small fishing village of Mystic , CT who have just graduated high school , work as waitress in the town Mystic Pizza parlor , and face decisions about the future of their lives . There are three less than fairytale romances with three male characters of varying potential as partners and it is the ' coming of age ' in a small Portuguese clan that sparks the tenderness and the sadness of this story written by Amy Holden Jones and directed by Donald Petrie . One of the most interesting aspects of this low budget film is how it catapulted Julia Roberts and Matt Damon ( who plays such a bit part he nearly goes unnoticed ) to fame , reinforced the careers of fine character actors Conchata Ferrell , Lili Taylor and Vincent D'Onofrio while pushing the then promising Annabeth Gish , William R . Moses and Adam Storke over into TV land roles . The film is a bit of nostalgia for a better time , has charm and innocence , and will always be one of those movies everyone who is a film collector will keep in their library for times when a return to simple little movies just makes you feel good .

513322	3223254	497316	8.0	Fragments of Coicidence and Connection	Though there have been many films of late that address the issues of the isolation of the individual in a society increasingly settling for homogeneity , few have the honesty and simplicity of presentation as Alfredo De Villa's ADRIFT IN MANHATTAN . Perhaps the reason this film works so well is that instead of dealing with the usual tropes , De Villa restricts his story to three individuals who are suffering isolation in the noise and autonomy of New York City and are thus ' adrift ' in a life that seems flat and without a beacon of hope . The story De Villa weaves is one of interaction of these characters by almost serendipitous incidents , moments that change their lives - at least for a while . Teenager Simon Colon ( Victor Rasuk ) lives with his overbearing mother Marta ( Marlene Forte ) and gets through his life almost without speaking , working in a camera shop , spending his idle hours photographing people in the park . Tommaso Pensara ( Dominic Chianese ) is an elderly painter and music lover who lives alone and supports himself by being the ' mail boy ' in a large firm : his loneliness is heightened when he discovers he has macular degeneration and will go blind . The physician who makes his diagnosis is Dr . Rose Phipps ( Heather Graham ) who is grieving from the recent death of her 2-year old child and is unable to continue her marriage to literature professor Mark Phipps ( William Baldwin ) . The threads of coincidence begin to tie these people together when Simon begins to photograph Rose in a manner that resembles stalking , when Tommaso notices and desires and older lady at his workplace , Isabel Parades ( Elizabeth Peña ) and is encouraged by Dr Rose to share his potential blindness with this friend , and when Rose explores the attention Simon bestows on her , filling an emotional need for both parties . Naturally the development of these intersections is more complex but at the same time the manner in which they develop is very tender and gentle . Some viewers may find the film meandering a bit too much : this is not linear storytelling but rather shifts in incidents and moods and gradual changes that occur among these simple but needy people , much like the coincidences and random kindnesses occur to the sensitive eye . The cast is very fine and the cinematography and musical score sustain the mood of the piece . This film requires involvement on the part of the viewer , and that involvement has its rewards .

513300	3223254	453548	8.0	Searching for Role Models	SNOW ANGELS is a tough movie from a tough novel by Stewart O'Nan , an author who continues to explore the darker corners of everyday people's lives without necessarily offering a path of redemption for the found flaws . Director David Gordon Green has adapted O'Nan's fine book for the screen , made some odd choices in the narrative line , but manages to maintain the pervasive sad and almost hopeless atmosphere of a little Pennsylvania town in the winter that is besieged by events that bruise the lives of many people . Arthur ( Michael Angarano , who continues to impress with superb acting ) is a high school kid , working as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant where his ' dream girl ' ( ex-babysitter ) Annie ( Kate Beckinsale ) and Annie's best friend Barb ( Amy Sedaris ) wait tables , filling his spare time playing trombone in the high school band , and enduring the crumbling marriage of his mother ( Jeanette Arnette ) and teacher father ( Griffin Dunne ) . Each of the characters we meet has baggage : Annie is separated from her ne're-do-well loser husband Glenn ( Sam Rockwell ) who haunts her with his desire to see his little daughter Tara while the confused Annie is having an affair with Nate ( Nicky Katt ) , a male nurse , who just happens to be married to Barb . Though Arthur maintains his fascination and puppy love for Annie , he is drawn into the adult world by his fellow student Lila ( Olivia Thirlby ) who becomes Arthur's first ' romance ' and physical experience . As Arthur attempts to form an adult outlook on relationships with Lila , the world in this tiny town becomes increasingly fragile . Little Tara strays from home only to be discovered during the resultant manhunt by Arthur who finds the child frozen in the lake . This tragedy only adds to Arthur's own tenuous coping with becoming an adult , and how Glenn and Annie deal with loss results in a profoundly sad ending that is accompanied by the incidental music of the high school band performing on a winter field in this place where things just happen . There is little to add light to the story , except that the performances by each of the actors are exceptionally fine . Director Green manages to create a fine ensemble feeling from these actors and while there are few characters with whom we can consistently empathize , Green manages to draw well-focused small town folk who remain in the mind long after the film is ended . Not a happy film , but a solid one . Grady Harp
513423	3223254	316829	8.0	In Memoriam : Akira Kurasawa	' Umi wa miteita ' ( ' The Sea is Watching ' ) was Akira Kurasawa's swansong to film : his adaptation of his favored novelist Shugoro Yamamoto's story into a screenplay he intended to film was his final mark he left on a brilliant career . Director Kei Kumai pays homage to both Kurosawa and Yamamoto in presenting this visually stunning transformation of word to image . Set in 19th century Japan , the story explores the lives of the women of a Geisha house whose sole purpose in life is to earn money by pleasuring men . The house is run by an older couple who are genteel and the geishas are an enchanting group of women who know their trade and take pride in their careers . Each has a reason for turning to the life of geisha . Oshin ( Nagiko Tono ) supports her family who live in a neighboring village , Kikuno ( Misa Shimizu ) has customers both good and evil whom she manages to sustain with her stories of her higher caste . Oshin befriends an endangered samurai , falls in love with the gentle fellow , only to find that he must not marry out of his caste and leaves his pleasures with Oshin to marry his promised betrothed . Oshin's heart bruises easily but is always supported emotionally and physically / monetarily by Kikuno and the other geishas . A handsome samurai Ryosuke ( Masatoshi Nagase ) enters Oshin's life and develops the first trusted and devoted relationship with her . Kikuno is beset by problems , deciding whether to accept the humble love of an old man who wishes to marry her , and coping with a rich but abusive customer . All the while the sea is watching and as a typhoon destroys the geisha house and street , Oshin and Kikuno sit atop the roof waiting for the promised rescue by Ryosuke . The manner in which the story ends is one of sacrifice , love , and devotion . The sea is watching and will find protection for true love . The photography by Kazuo Okuhara is breathtakingly beautiful : night scenes with glowing lanterns and colorful geisha interiors are matched with recurring glimpses of the sea both calm and turbulent . The acting is a bit strained for Edo art , but the characters are well created and keep the story credible . The one distraction which is definitely NOT something Kurosawa would have condoned is the tacky Western music score that sounds like cheap soap opera filler except for the isolated moments when real Japanese music on authentic instruments graces the track . But in the end there is enough of Kurosawa's influence to imbue this film with his brand of dreamlike wonder that will always maintain his importance on world cinema . Grady Harp
513078	3223254	433416	8.0	' We all come out of Gogol's Overcoat '	Jhumpa Lahiri's very popular novel THE NAMESAKE has been successfully adapted for the screen by Sooni Taraporevala and the gifted director Mira Nair has gathered a fine cast to capture the spirit of the original story of family commitment despite cultural changes and challenges . Some of the novel's impact is lost on the big screen , but the tender message remains at the end . In India a gifted young singer Ashima ( Tabu ) follows her family's rules of matchmaking and marries the quiet Ashoke ( Irfan Khan ) , and soon after the wedding festivities are over the couple depart to New York for Ashoke's career . The cultural and climate changes are a shock to both , but their marriage soon produces a boy child who , instead of being named traditionally by the grandmother in India , has to have a name assigned in the New York hospital in order to be released with a birth certificate . Out of desperation , Ashoke decides to temporarily name him Gogol ( Ashoke's favorite author ) - played as a child by Sohan Chatterjee - , and the family of three soon becomes a family of four with the arrival of their daughter Sonia ( Sahira Nair ) . While the parents maintain the customs of their Bengali heritage , the two children struggle with adapting to their preferred life in America and the conflict between parent and child is magnified by the cultural disparities . As young Gogol grows toward manhood ( now Kal Penn ) he favors Western ways and becomes involved with a non-Indian girl Maxine ( Jacinda Barrett ) and her family . Gogol tires of the critical comments about his name and decides to change his name to the more traditional Nick - further evidence of his separation from his background . But family tragedies occur and Gogol finds himself drawn to his mother and to his roots . When Gogol's father dies , the significance of his family grows even stronger and being unable to identify with Maxine and her family , he instead agrees to ' date ' a Bengali girl from his past - Moushumi ( Zuleikha Robinson ) has blossomed from the frumpy bookworm into a beautiful and experienced woman . They marry , keeping to Indian traditions , but the marriage is rocky and in the end Gogol discovers that his true happiness is in the rich family history and beauty of his native India . There are moments of rare beauty , both cinematically ( camera work is by Frederick Elmes ) and emotionally ( musical score is a lovely creation by Nitin Sawhney ) , and while the film is somewhat brittle at times due to the occasional bilingual nature of the script , the main characters are portrayed by such strong actors that the little flaws become unimportant . It is well to have so many films that deal with the immigrant experience at this particular juncture in our history , and when that theme is enhanced by the beauty of authors such as Lahiri , the messages become even more poignant .

513231	3223254	308129	8.0	A Very Fine , Fascinating Film That Seems to be Unfinished	CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE is a moody , dark , probing inquiry into the concept of celibacy of priests in the Catholic Church in Ireland and all the way to the Vatican . The concept , story and script by Writer / Director John Deery are tight , arrow sharp in aim , but ultimately unresolved issues cloud the success of what could have been a pungent movie . Set in a seminary in Ireland for preparing young men for the priesthood , we are introduced to some warmly human characters such as Daniel McLaughlin ( Jonathan Forbes ) , a squeaky clean lad who gave up a girlfriend Sinead ( Catherine Walker ) to follow his ( and his family's ) life ambition to become a priest . Naive , warm , loving , athletic and bright , he is the seminary poster boy - until one evening after hours he innocently visits a fellow seminarian's room and is the focus of seduction by the student who kindly says ' we're all only human and have our needs ' . Daniel gently declines the advances , leaves the student's room but is observed by an old priest with demons of his own . The priest reports the incident and Daniel is abruptly thrown out of the seminary by the evil Rector Cathal ( Sean McGinley ) for being homosexual - a charge that couldn't be farther from the truth . At the same time in another part of the seminary the fine Father Sweeney dresses in all his priestly regalia and commits suicide is a gruesome way . His suicide is threatening to the staff of the seminary and a cover-up is immediately put in place . It seems Father Sweeney some four years ago had stirred controversy in the Vatican by publicly exposing his HIV status , alerting the Church and the world that HIV was rampant in the world wide Church . His partner left the priesthood , disillusioned , but following FR Sweeney to the seminary in Ireland . An earnest reporter David Foley ( Jason Barry ) begins the investigation of the suicide and in doing so finds the reason for Daniel's expulsion as well as the myriad dark secrets being covered by the Church - all to do with the concept of celibacy and the inevitable sequelae of sensual deprivation on priests . One Father Jack Dowling ( Hugh Bonneville ) supports David and Daniel and is disenchanted with the behavior of the Church against its own priests . Then , without resolving any of these fascinating strings of thought the movie ends , leaving many questions unanswered - as though there are no answers . The acting is uniformly strong ( including the likes of Brenda Fricker as Daniel's mother et al ) , for once giving a spectrum of the priesthood that is not favoring bad or good . These characters are men with convictions and none can be faulted for their stances . The setting in Ireland is magnificently captured by cinematographer Jason Lehel , and Francis Haines and Stephen W . Parsons provide a hauntingly beautiful musical score . As far as it takes us this is a fine film . Perhaps Deery is planning Part II to finish this story ! Grady Harp
513441	3223254	332136	8.0	Instant Replay . . . of Sorts	Christina Welsh has written a fine screenplay that proves that old ideas can be re-worked in a thoroughly original way . Gil Junger steps out of his role as a director for TV series and molds Welsh's story into a visually charming and sensible , touching movie . Add the considerable talents of one highly regarded pro ( Tom Wilkinson ) and two underrated young bright lights ( Jennifer Love Hewitt and Paul Nicholls ) and the result is a little film that is polished , absorbing , and genuinely tender . Samantha ( Hewitt ) is a musician living and studying in London where she is in a healthy relationship with a handsome young executive Ian ( Nicholls ) : though obviously in love , Ian is more involved with his work than Samantha would like and on the day of her ' finals concert ' they have a spat over several issues . On his way to his all-important meeting Ian encounters a taxi driver ( Wilkinson ) who gives him some sage advice about his love life . Abruptly Samantha is killed in a freak auto accident and Ian is devastated . In his grief he strangely awakens to the same day in which Samantha was killed , and through a series of working through the elements of his life where he failed her ( with a bit of aid from the taxi driver ) , Ian has an ' If only ' experience , a time to re-evaluate his love for Samantha , his life , and his changes . A twist in the events brings the story to a surprise but apropos ending . From what could have been yet another love-death tearjerker of a Hollywood movie emerges a story with heart and with some poignant lessons for us all . Hewitt proves a fine actress in this film and is beautifully paired by the exciting presence of relative newcomer Paul Nichols . It is not a great movie , but it is one that will pleasantly surprise viewers who may have though it was just another ' chick flick ' . Give it a chance - it is worth it ! Grady Harp
512808	3223254	116164	8.0	A Breezy , Entertaining and Refreshingly Honest Comedy	ECHTE KERLE or REGULAR GUYS is a polished little 1996 comedy from Germany that manages to tell a tale of mixing genders and satisfy all viewers no matter their viewpoint . Rarely has a film handled straight / gay juxtapositions with such an unbiased , honest and relaxed vantage . So often these gender bender films have the look of mini-budget movies , but this film as directed by Rolf Silber based on a screenplay by Silber and Rudolf Bergmann is photographed with panache by Jürgen Herrmann is slickly creative and wholly professional . Christoph Schwenk ( Christoph Ohrt ) is a plainclothesman police officer who does stakeouts spying on criminals with his partners Mike ( Oliver Stokowski ) and Helen ( Carin Tietze ) . As the film opens Christoph is thrown out of his place by his ' ignored ' girlfriend who has replaced him with a bodybuilder lover . Dismayed and angry , Christoph begins to drink , loses his car keys , his belongings on the street , and ends up with no place to stay as he stumbles into a gay bar where he passes out completely drunk . When he awakens he discovers he is in the arms of Edgar , a handsome auto mechanic who rehabs cars ( ? stolen ? ) and the question arises as to whether the two had sex during the night . Edgar is a kind and gentle man who evades this question , obviously feeling an attraction to Christoph . Edgar clothes Christoph so that he can find a place to stay and make it to work at the current stake out which just happens to be spying on car thieves . At work Mike and Helen notice something different in the paranoid Christoph who is more interested in finding an apartment and resolving his question of the previous night's sexual occurrences than he is with work . Unable to find any kind of hotel or apartment at all , he sleeps in his car until he eventually has the nerve to accept Edgar's offer for him to move in with him . Christoph makes it clear that is his Straight and Edgar makes it equally clear that he is Gay and likes Christoph . The relationship between Christoph and Edgar gradually strengthens , the threat of sexuality weakens to the point that as Christoph is seen in public with Edgar and when razed at work , Christoph sides with the idea of appearing gay and has a wonderful locker room confrontation with his fellow cops that says a lot about the barriers between gays and straights ! Slowly , as Christoph settles into his new living conditions , he becomes enamored with Helen who is more than ready to pursue Christoph as she notices his ' machoisms ' dwindle . At the same time Edgar's weekend lover Marco ( Andreas Pietschmann ) causes Christoph to query his surprising ' jealousy ' . The three police become friendly with Edgar and Marco and when it seems they may be involved in the car theft ring under stakeout , they each find it easier to turn the other cheek and support each other . The ending pairs off the various members of this story in a warm and funny way , a manner which some may find predictable , but still satisfying and allowing all barriers to be down . The cast is uniformly excellent - the cameo supporting roles are very well done - and for once a film about straight perceptions of gay life makes ALL of the characters non-stereotyped : the men are all handsome hunks and the women are all beauties . This is light entertainment , a comedy with a message well stated .
513210	3223254	140397	8.0	What Exactly Constitutes Being A Psychologist ?	MUMFORD is a delicious little film from 1999 written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan ( The Big Chill , Grand Canyon , The Accidental Tourist , Silverado , etc ) who as usual poses some interesting questions as to our contemporary take on concepts . It is a quiet , beautifully acted ensemble film that wears well indeed . Mumford ( the underused Loren Dean ) is a man with a variegated past who settles into a little town by the name of Mumford , decides he will listen to people talk , be a sounding board for folks who are in need of communication in this basically non-communicative world , and becomes a ' Psychologist ' in every sense of the word - the good sense . The manner in which he listens to the many people within the little town is mesmerizing and insightful and the citizens he encounters and assists are varied and beautifully sculpted vulnerable human beings . The fine cast includes Hope Davis , Jason Lee ( in one his finest roles ) , Mary McDonnell , Alfre Woodard , Zooey Deschanel , Martin Short , David Paymer , Kevin Tighe , Ted Danson , Jason Ritter and even more . The dialogue is introspective , healing , edgy , and entertaining and the overall feeling left with the viewer at the end of the piece is one of wishing more ' Mumfords ' would be around our neighborhoods - or rather that we all could become ' Mumfords ' with a little conviction and concern for our fellow beings . This is a Kasdan concept movie that touches our hearts while it stimulates our brains . Grady Harp
513118	3223254	410297	8.0	A Visual Feast for a Time Travel Love Story	Anytime a story is about time travel the audience must accept the fact that suspension of belief is mandatory . Based on a Korean film ' Siworae ' by Eun-Jeong Kim and Ji-na Yeo and adapted for the latest version by David Auburn , Alejandro Agresti has his work cut out for him . The story is Swiss cheese full of holes as anyone would expect from a tale about two people who fall in love from the disparate vantages of 2004 and 2006 and as long as the viewer accepts the inherent incongruities of such a story the overall effect is really quite lovely , if a bit too uninvolving . Dr . Kate Forster ( Sandra Bullock ) has a history of living in a glass lake house outside Chicago but when we meet her she lives in a luxury apartment while she is on staff at a small hospital . Alex Wyler ( Keanu Reeves ) currently lives in the lake house ( we discover that his father played by Christopher Plummer is an architect who built the house years ago ) and begins to find mail in his mailbox from the previous tenant Kate . The story weaves back and forth between 2004 and 2006 and keeping score is rather tricky at times , but eventually of course the two time-lapsed people meet , the riddles are unexplained , they fall in love over the distance of time , etc . There is not a lot of message here except that real love can occur despite almost any obstacle . Reeves and Bullock are fine , but the rest of the characters are sketchy and only tangentially relevant to the story . A family discourse among Reeves , Plummer , and Ebon Moss-Bachrach ( Henry , the other brother ) never gels . The supporting cast includes interesting actors such as Shohreh Aghdashloo but they have little to do . In fact the scenery and the house seem to be the main characters and that really is OK because both are beautiful , thanks to Alar Kivilo's cinematography , and Rachel Portman's musical score is very fine . It is not a deep film and it could benefit from a really good re-write of the script , but for an evening's diversion it is pretty to look at and tender in content . Just forget about the holes and you'll be fine . Grady Harp
513587	3223254	382077	8.0	' Come out , come out wherever you are . . . '	HIDE AND SEEK is a multileveled film that raises as many questions as it answers . Even the screenwriter Ari Schlossberg and director John Polson seem as though they weren't sure about the mysterious workings of their characters : there are four alternative endings on the DVD , each of which suggests something much different than the final moments of this sleekly drawn suspense thriller . I like that ! This is a story that the audience will feel seduced by the odd behaviors of ALL of the characters : everyone is suspect for the spooky derring-do that fills this film . Psychologist Dr . David Calloway ( Robert DeNiro ) and his daughter Emily ( Dakota Fanning ) are decimated by their discovery of the apparent suicide of their wife / mother Alison ( Amy Irving ) and against the advice of David's fellow psychologist Katherine ( Famke Janssen ) , they move to a spooky old house in the woods of upstate New York . Emily remains withdrawn , electing to be friends only with ' Charley ' , a probable fictive ideation . Neighbors ( Melissa Leo and Robert John Burke ) extend kindness but at the same time are a bit ominous . Even the sheriff ( Dylan Baker ) and the realtor ( David Chandler ) are weird . The only bit of light in this disturbed household radiates from Elizabeth ( Elizabeth Shue ) who offers friendship but whom Emily dislikes because she sees her as a threat to her father's memory of the deceased mother . Bizarre and heinous incidents happen with more and more regularity , each time the tragic situations attributed to Emily are blamed on her friend Charley . When everyone outside the house become suspect the story really takes a turn that results in the unsuspected ending . More than just a strange scary movie about the game of hide and seek this is a rather disturbing document on the extremes that mental illness can cause . The capable roles growth and change between DeNiro and Fanning is superb and while there may be a little too much for the average movie buff to swallow , the points are well presented . Give this little thriller a chance and see if you can diagnose the endings - better than the filmmakers could ! Not a great movie , but at least as good as others in this genre , plus it has the bonus of DeNiro and Fanning ! Grady Harp , July 05
513377	3223254	367089	8.0	The Permutations of the Broken Family	Noah Baumbach makes an impressive debut as writer / director of his autobiographical story THE SQUID AND THE WHALE . It is a piece of life sliced out of the 1980s that is just as pertinent to today's culture as it was to the period piece Baumbach resurrects . Bernard Berkman ( Jeff Daniels ) is a shell of a being , a once famous writer who is now living as an unctuous teacher while his wife Joan ( Laura Linney ) is rising in fame as a novelist . Their marriage is obviously tired : 17 years have endured dissatisfactions that have finally bubbled to the surface where the couple decides to separate . They have two boys : Walt ( Jesse Eisenberg ) is a teenager who writes music and worships his father's literary mind while the younger Frank is a wide eyed devotee of his mother's affection . They are polarized in their commitments to their separating parents and struggle with the business of adapting to joint custody and split homes . Walt escapes into music that results in an embarrassing secret and into nascent sexual experiences with his plain girlfriend Sophie ( Halley Feiffer ) , encountering sexual dysfunction in ego damaging ways . Frank responds with his own brand of sexual dysfunction that is at once hilarious and disturbing . Bernard takes on a licentious student Lili ( Anna Paquin ) who is without a place to stay , complicating libido-driven Frank's life and blurring Bernard's perception of propriety . When it is discovered that Joan has been having affairs throughout the marriage and is now involved with the boys ' tennis coach Ivan ( William Baldwin ) , the family's fragile surface cracks open and the fracture is a compound one . How this dysfunctional family unit copes with the new way of life is the means to the end of the film . While each of the actors gives career defining performances ( even the young boys are superb ) the film leaves us with a somewhat distant feeling : as well as these characters is each described and enacted it is very difficult to like or identify with any of them , as they are each self-centered and narrow minded people making them difficult to enjoy . But that fact doesn't alter the final result of a film beautifully written , directed and acted . This is first-rate movie making from a young artist with an exciting future . It will be great to watch for his next , less personalized story . Grady Harp
512675	3223254	875705	8.0	Running Home	LAKE CITY is a little low budget film that has a good enough story behind it , backed by several social issues that are well handled to make it work . Writers / Directors Hunter Hill and Perry Moore present a flavorful feeling of the South and keep this at times creaky story line moving along with the necessary momentum to maintain the viewer's interest . The male lead of the film is in the Fonda line ( Jane as mother , Peter as uncle , Henry as grandfather ) and as such Troy Garity seems to have inherited the right genes . As Billy he is the central character : Billy left a troubled home to seek his fortune as a guitar musician , but became involved with Hope ( Drea de Matteo ) who is deep into drugs and drug theft and has left son Clayton ( Colin Ford ) in Troy's care . Troy is implicated in the drug theft and narrowly escapes death at the hands of dealer Red ( David Matthews ) , taking Clayton with him to his hometown and mother Maggie ( Sissy Spacek ) . Troy's alcoholism and trauma drive him to AA meetings where he shares time with his old girlfriend-now-a-cop Jennifer ( Rebecca Romijn ) . There are flashbacks that suggest a childhood trauma in Troy's past , a trauma that has driven a schism between Troy and Maggie . And there are many twists and turns ( some rather poorly delineated ) that would be spoilers to reveal , but suffice it to say that this druggie on the run and son / mother relationship as well as the origin of the young keenly observant and needy Clayton together unfold the history of a family at risk . Sissy Spacek is fine as Maggie and Troy Garity shows strong promise as Troy . There are some minor subplots that include actors such as Keith Carradine that add little except atmosphere . Despite its flaws LAKE CITY provides strong entertainment . Grady Harp
513402	3223254	115964	8.0	The Etiology of Sexual Arousal : Edge of Life Terror	David Cronenberg takes chances and his pushing the edge of cinematic art is what makes his films so interesting . JG Ballard's controversial novel CRASH seemed an unlikely prospect for a film , so dark were its explorations of the outer zones of excitation and their relationship to near-death events . But Cronenberg worked through making Ballard's visions visual and his screenplay based on Ballard's book is more about interior dialogue and visceral sexual encounters as they relate to trauma . James Ballard ( James Spader ) is a successful TV director who spends as much time as a lothario as he does making film . He is married to Catherine ( Deborah Kara Unger ) whose own sexuality leads her into stray paths . The two seem to connect physically but the fire is diminishing : they both concur that encounters with other partners enhance their sexual experiences . James is in a car accident and survives with a broken leg and scars , but the other car's male driver was killed and his surviving female companion Helen Remington ( Holly Hunter ) is hospitalized with James . While in the hospital both encounter a strange , scarred , limping male photographer Vaughn ( Elias Koteas ) who takes photos of the scars and trauma results of both James and Helen . Catherine visits James in the hospital and seems to find excitement in the scars and orthopedic paraphernalia binding her husband . Once James is released from the hospital he is strangely drawn to the car he wrecked and finds Helen in the same mindset . The two move into physical attraction as well as an emotional attraction to Vaughn . Vaughn is obsessed with auto accidents , having been in many , and he stages famous car accidents ( James Dean , Jayne Mansfield , etc ) for a captive audience - which includes James , Helen , and Catherine . Vaughn insidiously draws the three into his obsession , sharing his ' actors ' and fellow travelers - including Gabrielle ( Rosanna Arquette - with both legs in orthopedic mechanisms ) , Colin and Vera Seagrave ( Peter MacNeill and Cheryl Swarts ) and those who help him stage his ' accidents ' . Vaughn explains that he is exploring how to achieve that sensation of terror one feels during a car crash and equate it with orgasm . The odd group of folks all sexually interact with abandon : the crashed car becomes the bedchamber for bizarre sexual acting out . And how this all plays out in the end is the part of the film that simply must be seen to feel the experience . This is clearly NOT a movie for everyone . The CD contains both the NC and the R rated version : I watched the NC version and while it is graphic and focused on sex it is oddly uninvolving emotionally - we care little about the people we meet . Perhaps part of the story here is that with the progressively dehumanization of man in his symbiotic relationship with machines , relating to fellow humans on anything except the sensual gratification is something we are losing . That is the kind of powerful statement Cronenberg shows us with these passionate yet cold people . The cast is exceptional , especially Koteas whose warped character is wholly three-dimensional as opposed to the oddly uninvolved characters Spader , Unger , and Hunter portray . A dizzying experience ! Grady Harp
512679	3223254	398963	8.0	A Smart , Snappy , Sensitive Coming Out Movie	Writer / director / producer Tennyson Bardwell is definitely a talent to watch . In his first venture into film , DORIAN BLUES , he has created an intelligent script with razor sharp dialogue , witty and acerbic and touching depending on the moment , and has cast his film with a fine groups of actors who obviously hold him in great respect , as the final product is a polished film that is always entertaining as well as informative . Few ' coming out ' films flesh out the territory as succinctly and realistically as this . Dorian Lagatos ( a fresh and talented Michael McMillian ) is sour on the world that doesn't understand him . His family is the microscope on his world : a right wing radical father Tom ( Charles Fletcher ) , a seemingly ditsy but subservient mother Maria ( Mo Quigley ) , and a brother Nicky ( another bright and hunky talent Lea Coco ) who is everything Dorian isn't - a jock , a ladies ' man , and a happy-go-lucky high schooler . Dorian has an ' epiphany ' : he discovers the reason he doesn't fit in is that he is gay ! With his discovery he finds some solace from another edgy gay friend Spooky ( Austin Basis ) but still feels he must remain in the closet . Finally he confides in Nicky who surprisingly listens to him and accepts him - just so long as Dorian doesn't act out . Frustrated , Dorian leaves for New York for college while Nicky wins a sports scholarship to another college . In New York Dorian finds the gay life , feels ' normal ' at last , falls in love , confronts rejection and the games people play , and then lives a despondent life until Nicky visits him : Nicky has lost his scholarship . The two brothers make the rounds of Dorian's milieu until they receive a phone call that their father has died . Returning home Dorian must still face his anger at his father , though dead , and it is this anger that his mother ( far more sensitive than Dorian ever knew ) confronts Dorian and the message of the movie is completed in a very realistic and understanding way . Life's philosophy is not wholly bound to one's sexual preferences . Michael McMillian and Lea Coco both give notice of being young gifted actors to watch . And the apparently ' film inexperienced ' Charles Fletcher and Mo Quigley deliver radiant cameo roles . Indeed the entire supporting cast is excellent , perhaps due to the fact the Bardwell is a fine director ! This is a gay coming out film that is intelligent , free of the usual visuals that distract the general audience , and one that has more healthy bits of psychology scattered throughout than many a feature film . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
512703	3223254	398982	8.0	Divorce , Addiction , and Other Obstacles in the Path to Happiness	Matt Mulhern is an actor turned writer / director in this amazingly fine first feature film . If DUANE HOPWOOD is any indication of the storehouse of creative and gently profound films housed in Mulhern's mind , we have a major artist being birthed . Duane Hopwood ( David Schwimmer ) is a loser : despite the fact that he is one of the most loving beings around , he is plagued by the realities of life - working a testy night job as a pit boss in Caesar's Palace in Atlantic City , failing to be present for a wife and two girls he loves but neglects due to his working hours and that has resulted in divorce , alcoholism , and failure to repair - he just can't make his life work . After a DUI arrest in which Duane has inadvertently jeopardized the life of one of his passenger daughters , is ex-wife Linda ( Janeane Garofalo ) is driven to prevent visitation rights to a man she recognizes is in truth a loving father who simply can't cope . Duane lives alone until his casino friend Anthony ( Judah Friedlander ) , a would be stand up comic , asks to share Duane's home . Duane's bad luck follows him even when he is trying to give despicable people a fair break at the casino and hence loses his job . He attempts to date a kind Irish bartender Gina ( Susan Lynch ) but fails that role when he confesses that he still loves his wife . The ultimate blow comes when Linda and her new boyfriend Bob ( John Krasinski ) decide to move to North Carolina , a fact that means Duane will rarely see his beloved daughters . And his life continues to pall-mall despite all the loving hands offered by the good people around him . The story has no beginning and no end . It is a slice of life about an Everyman racked by bad decisions , good at heart but unable to control his propensities , and the effects of addiction , divorce , and loneliness on a kind but bumbling soul . David Schwimmer gives a deeply moving performance , one that is so sensitively rendered that it holds mirrors to us all , making us love him as much as the people around him who stand by helplessly by as he spirals down the hole of self-destructive behavior . Janeane Garofalo likewise steps out of her usual silly chubby mouthy roles and gives us an injured but wholly understandable bruised woman : her acting is the finest she has ever given us . The entire cast ( with some surprise appearances by some fine actors ) is top notch , but in the end the kudos go to Matt Mulhern for offering us one of the best examinations of divorce and modern marriage with an eye that clearly sees both sides of trauma . This is an underrated , superb film that deserves a wide audience . Grady Harp
513313	3223254	397101	8.0	A Gothic Thriller Delivered with Panache	A Gothic Thriller Delivered with Panache , November 17 , 2005Reviewer : Grady Harp ( Los Angeles , CA United States ) - See all my reviews Writer Ehren Kruger ( ' The Ring ' movies , ' The Brothers Grimm ' ) has supplied Director Iain Softley ( ' Wings of the Dove ' ) with a sound story from which Softley has created a satisfyingly dark film about death and dying and Hoodoo magic in the swampy region of Louisiana . Without resorting to the usual stock gimmicks , THE SKELETON KEY works on many levels to frighten and entertain and it succeeds ! Caroline ( Kate Hudson ) is a beautiful 25-year old whose guilt over her absence from her father's deathbed has driven her to seek work in nursing homes ( the film's opening sequence with Caroline reading to a dying man is elegant and touching and quite timely ) and ultimately to hospice care . Answering an ad in the paper for a hospice nurse takes her to a strange old Southern mansion in which live the Devereauxs - Violet ( Gena Rowlands ) and her bedridden husband Ben ( John Hurt ) . Caroline passes her interview and at the warm insistence of the family lawyer Luke ( Peter Sarsgaard ) she takes the job . Violet is a frightening old lady who entrusts Caroline with a skeleton key which opens the doors of all 30 rooms of the creaky , musty mansion - except for one door in the attic . Noting there are no mirrors in the house , Caroline begins to investigate the place and Ben's seemingly terrified state and discovers the forbidden room contains elements of dark magic . She seeks information from her close friend Jill ( Joy Bryant ) who skeptically informs her that the symbols and paraphernalia Caroline has discovered are factors of Hoodoo - a strange magic whose multi-ethnic beginnings are in New Orleans . Slowly Caroline challenges Violet for information and finding none , seeks the advice of a Hoodoo woman ( Fahnlohnee R . Harris ) for answers . The bizarre dark secrets of the old mansion and the Devereaux couple ultimately come into focus and it is up to Caroline to break some spells . . . . if that is possible . With a cast this fine it would be surprising if the film didn't fly and each of the actors creates a credible creature that involves us from the beginning . Yes , the horror story is accompanied by rain storms and thunder storms that serve to heighten the tension and the pacing by director Softley keeps the audience alert and suspicious and ultimately surprised . This is one of the better thrillers released in some time . Recommended especially to devotees of the thriller genre ! Grady Harp
513659	3223254	303313	8.0	A Meditation on Roots	While we as a country are discovering / acknowledging the struggles of the different sects within the Middle East , tribal differences that are longstanding and divisive and painful , along comes another sensitive story about Native Americans in this country and how the scars of past and ongoing abuses of our ' reservation resolution ' have affected the original peoples of this land . Sherman Alexie , a fine poet and novelist , has transformed his written works into a film that showers the viewer with insights into a problem about which few are cognizant - intratribal differences that provide schisms within the only root that binds . Seymour Poltakin ( the very talented Evan Adams ) is a famous poet who happens to be both Native American and gay . He is called back to his Reservation in Spokane , Washington for the funeral of his childhood friend Mouse ( Swil Kanim ) only to confront all of the reasons he has left the Reservation for the ' white man's world ' where he has found both financial and emotional success . Seymour's best friend Aristotle ( Gene Tagaban ) had originally left the Reservation to go to college with Seymour , but quickly soured to the prejudiced outside world and returned to his Reservation and to an unfortunate life of alcoholism and drug abuse . The bulk of the storyline revolves around how these two once devoted friends parted ways , the philosophies of each are explored , and though Seymour finds moments of love in his home space , he is still content to return to his white man lover and his life he has chosen . There are many very tender and moving moments in this film : when Seymour is in conversation with Agnes ( Michelle St . John ) and when Agnes intones the Indian chants and songs at the funeral ; Seymour's dialogues with his lover ; scenes of quiet while Aristotle abuses himself with drugs ; the weaving in and out of the beautiful dancing that flows through the film . The problem with the movie is the disparity of approaches in telling the story : an interview situation between Rebecca Carroll and Evan Adams is well written but breaks the mood of the poetic form of the story . The film is obviously low budget and in this case , for this viewer , the rough hand-held camera technique adds a quality of reality to what we are watching . The overall effect at the end of the film is a pang of pain in the heart having witnessed the generations of ' isolation ' and the segregation of the Native Americans into spaces both geographical and sociological that have undermined a tremendously valuable asset to our history . That role of shame is one that will never leave us , and it is a gift that artists like Sherman Alexie can bring this to the public's attention . Recommended . Grady Harp
513334	3223254	384488	8.0	Every little movement has a meaning all its own . . . .	SAINT RALPH is a little jewel of a film . Stories about kids who gain faith through acts of courage are usually tainted with saccharine scripts , but with the wise use of presenting a well-rounded , multidimensional character as the hero of this story , writer / director Michael McGowan succeeds in a touching tale that is so based on real behavioral patterns of young teens that it becomes simply an inspiring and entertaining movie . Ralph ( Adam Butcher ) is 14 , his father died a war hero , and his mother is hospitalized for a terminal illness . Ralph is in Catholic School run by the stern disciplinarian Father Fitzpatrick ( Gordon Pinsent ) who , understanding that Ralph has a free spirit and a propensity for getting into trouble , spies on him . Ralph is repeatedly ' punished ' for his transgressions , but when he inadvertently has a hilarious swimming pool / voyeuristic experience , he is threatened with expulsion unless he joins the school's Cross Country team run by the kindly Father Hibbert ( Campbell Scott ) . Ralph's ' naughty nature ' is balanced by his complete devotion to his hospitalized mother ( Shauna MacDonald ) whom he visits daily : she is all he has . His mother's nurse ( Jennifer Tilly ) is compassionate and shares with Ralph that as his mother slips into coma that the only thing that will save her is a miracle . Simultaneously Ralph's coach ( Father Hibbert ) jests that the only way any of the team would win the Boston Marathon would be a miracle . The dots connect ; Ralph trains , and through faith and commitment finds himself crossing the finish line of the Marathon ! The manner in which McGowan ends the story is part of what makes this film unique . Just as he allows Ralph to be a testy kid who continues to have hilarious episodes right up to the end of the story , he doesn't let the film end in bathos . He makes every action and deed that occur in Ralph's journey combine to drive toward the final meaning . So here is a gentle comedy with a heart , one that is touching while it is a little racy , full of faith while it tests rationality . The cast is superb and seem committed under McGowan's wise direction to find just the right level of realism , making us root strongly for a kid with impossible challenges . Recommended . Grady Harp
513489	3223254	349260	8.0	A Fine Documentary Cluttered with Peripheral Distractions	IN MY COUNTRY ( COUNTRY OF MY SKULL ) , based on a book by Antjie Krog about South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission ( TRC ) of 1996 set in the aftermath of Apartheid , has been altered by screenwriter Ann Peacock and director John Boorman who have elected to ' dramatize ' that event by fleshing out ' committed journalists ' on both sides of the color fence : South Afrikaner Anna Malan ( Juliette Binoche ) and American hothead Langston Whitfield ( Samuel L . Jackson ) . The dichotomy of the white / black reconciliation is thus reversed ; Anna is white defending the South African blacks while Langston is black firing his vitriol against the white South Afrikaners . The story is immensely important to tell : 21 , 800 blacks were tortured and killed in the final days of Apartheid , but in the wisdom of South African philosophy the perpetrators are given amnesty if they confront their crimes and show remorse . This noble morality is the single most touching aspect of this story . During the Commission hearings all reporters hear the grief of the victims ' families and are stunned . Though initially hostile to each other , Anna and Langston gradually are able to listen to each other's perspectives and become romantically involved ( both are married with children ) and as the film ends the affair is ended in keeping with the example of the truth the TRC has established . In an attempt to make this reality into a movie the impact is dulled by the Hollywoodesque treatment . Yes , Binoche and Jackson are fine actors ( as is Menzi Ngubane who plays a wholly lovable South African instigator ) , but the melodrama they are forced to enact is superficial and does not add to the otherwise powerful message of this film . This is a movie that deserves the attention of a wide audience . Just pay more attention to the facts than to the soupy frosting under which it plays . Grady Harp
512802	3223254	376006	8.0	Ménage a Trois , but on whose terms ?	If three can play at love , and if that love is an equilateral triangle , then each of the three is equally responsible for the ramifications . Were that the case in this little low budget Indie film BOOK OF LOVE the story would have more resonance . But art imitates life and life is full of contradictions and double standards and that is what seems to writer / director Alan Brown seems out to show us . David ( Simon Baker ) is a popular history teacher in a private girl's school in New Jersey and is blissfully married to Elaine ( Frances O'Connor ) who is an Events Planner and thrives on her time with her husband , wanting to delay having children for ' at least ten years ' in lieu of an exciting marital sex life . Into this radiantly alive couple's life enters a young fifteen-year-old highschool student and swimmer Chet ( Gregory Smith ) who happens to meet them in an ice cream parlour and immediately feels a warmth for the two of them . The feeling is mutual , especially and David and Elaine learn that Chet has no strong family ties , has never even been into Manhattan much less to Disney World , a place Chet covets . David and Elaine invite Chet into their home and lives , dining with him , taking him to a club in Manhattan ( a place where Elaine takes the stage to sing with her lesbian friend entertainer ) , involving him in talks about Cambodian history and philosophy , etc . As an aside , their lesbian couple friends approach David to be the sperm donor for a child and Elaine and David agree to their request . David , Elaine and Chet appear to be a most happy trio until Chet makes physical advances to Elaine , advances which Elaine initially gently rebuffs but simultaneously feels awakened sensual responses to this young virginal lad . Chet finds it difficult to separate his love for the couple and his corporeal desires and ultimately Chet and Elaine have a sexual encounter . Elaine confesses her indiscretion to David , allows him his initial pain , and then is surprised at David's forgiveness and immediate physical response to her . Chet comes to David's office , apologizes for the event , and David again surprises Chet with his forgiveness and his suggestion that the trio continue with David's promised trip for the three of them to Disney World . While on the outing to Disney World David invites Chet into the hotel room for a drink and a demonstration of Chet's diving skills , a set up for a physical encounter on the floor . Elaine enters the room , sees the encounter as a sexual one , frightens Chet who stabs David in a scuffle , and the Disney World trip ends in disaster . It is the working out of the new twist on the triangle that furnishes the rest of the film and the final results of the trio's relationship is surprising and stretches the limits of credibility . The problem member of this ménage a trois is Elaine , a woman who allows herself to become sexually involved with Chet , but when she believes David is likewise sexually involved with the lad she is unable to cope . It seems like the woman of the triangle determines the rules and that is where many will feel this story is more tragic . O'Connor is a fine English / Australian actress and gives a top-flight performance . Simon Baker is another Australian ( Tasmanian ) actor who has a great deal of depth and strong screen presence . Gregory Smith is a young Canadian actor who shows tremendous promise . Together the three give fine ensemble acting that makes this unlikely trio credibility and engages our empathy . There is a lot of talent in this little film and for a first movie writer / director Alan Brown gives notice of a talent to watch . In time some of the side indulgences included in this film will be less intrusive and more insightfully utilized . But on the whole this is a successful film worth watching . Grady Harp , April 05
513550	3223254	397313	8.0	Credit Where Credit is Due : The Real Stars of a Fine Movie	EIGHT BELOW is a satisfying film on every level : the story is excellent ( based on fact ) , the script is good , the direction by Frank Marshall is tight and fast paced for a two hour film , the scenery is spectacular and the cast is committed and well chosen . But the real stars of this film are the eight wondrous dogs who for much of the film carry the entire story of being on their own in the Antarctica winter for five plus months - and for the most part surviving through bonding and obvious devotion to each other . They are splendid - beautiful to watch in action and touching to observe in their interaction . But the dogs alone could not have made this happen without the other true stars of the picture - the dog trainers . They deserve mention , so here they are : Michael Alexander and Sally Jo Sousa are the main trainers and are well supported by Tammy Blackburn , Tracy Gardhouse , Thomas L . Gunderson , Rowan Harland , Trish Judd , Dea Valentin Kristensen , Grace McLeod , Scott Rowe , Andrew Simpson , Cherie Smith and Tim Williams . There ! The kudos go to them and their names are buried in the credits . The story is one of dedication and devotion of a group of sledders in the Antarctica who take researchers , such as Doctor McLaren ( Bruce Greenwood ) who is looking for a meteorite from Mercury , on their missions . The main dog lover and trainer is Jerry ( Paul Walker in one of his best performances ) and he is assisted by Katie ( Moon Bloodgood ) and Coop ( Jason Biggs ) . When Jerry is out with the eight dogs taking Doctor McLaren to fine his meteorite , a major storm arises and the dogs and the two men barely make it back to the station , McLaren suffering a broken leg and saved by the bravery of the dogs and Jerry . The crew must evacuate and Jerry insists the dogs be taken out with them , but he is promised that the pilot Katie will return for them , a deed which goes unkept because of the severe weather . The dogs are left to fend for themselves and Jerry is heartbroken , making every feasible attempt to rescue them . By films ends we have witnessed the miracle of survival of the dogs and a demonstration of the profound bonding between man and animal . This film may seem slight from the photo on the DVD , but it is one of those family oriented films that breaks barriers and delivers on a grand scale some very important emotional content . The cast is excellent ( the dogs of course being the main characters ) . The production values are superb except for a strangely mawkish score by Mark Isham . Well worth your time and attention .
513375	3223254	445620	8.0	Boundaries , Checkpoints , and Martyrdom	PARADISE NOW opens windows of information to those of us who do not live in the Middle East and who toil over understanding the strife that daily bitterly continues , bruising the lives of both ends of the polarity that separates the peoples of the region . Are there ever to be answers or solutions to the crises ? For this viewer watching and absorbing PARADISE NOW is illuminating in that it removes the expected political preaching to focus on the minds of the people living under the daily stress of life at its most difficult . Taking us there , making ideas into people with all the convictions and rebelliousness and fragility , writer / director Hany Abu-Assad ( with Bero Beyer ) offers invaluable insights and in the end we are left with a story about humanity and the consequences of decisions , and the desperate need for peace . Said ( Kais Nashef ) and Khaled ( Ali Suliman ) are childhood friends in Palestine who have been elected to be suicide bombers in an attack on Tel Aviv . Their election to be martyrs for the destruction of the ' invaders ' is considered an honor : their deaths will bring glory to their country , their families , and guarantee them instant entry into heaven . We see the two men as citizens living in the dusty hovels , facing barricades and checkpoints that make their lives ones of constant stress . Martyrdom will bring them peace and eternal rest . The entire process of preparing the elected martyrs , from making farewell videotapes for their parents , to having their hair cut short , to having the bombs strapped to their bodies , to dressing them in black suits for the ' wedding ' they are instructed to claim to attend in Tel Aviv , to sending them off at the designated spot is relentlessly filmed . Said and Khaled accept their roles although with varying degrees of emotional commitment . At the point where the lads are to begin their martyrdom venture they are separated and the story is how each continues living , each now alone . The families and the perpetrators of the scheme are well drawn by a strong cast , with one female role Suha ( Lubna Azabal ) as a voice of reason and peace standing out particularly strongly . The sensitivity of the actors Kais Nashef and Ali Suliman keeps this drama from sinking into politicism and instead allows us to understand the inner turmoil of the two men they portray as they cope with their duties and their lives . This is a powerful document that serves as a plea for peace wherever terrorism is a factor - and now that is global . If more of us could watch and absorb films such as PARADISE NOW perhaps the itinerant boundaries separating mankind by misunderstanding could be reduced without the need for war . Highly Recommended . In Arabic with English subtitles . Grady Harp
513114	3223254	393775	8.0	Tables Turning	SIMON is a little jewel of a film . In a manner more typically Dutch than most it is an exploration of the interaction of two men , opposites in almost every way except in their potential power of friendship . Camiel is a gay , tender , polite , dental student while Simon is straight , seemingly critical of gay aspects ( though always with tongue in cheek ) , noisy , outspoken , crafty , boisterous and a bit crude café owner . The two collide in an accident , an act that bonds them inextricably , and the film shows the two polar opposites reconnecting fourteen years later when Simon is dying of cancer and calls upon all his resources and involves Camiel in the difficult process of life's ending . Simon's strength of character ( despite his previous outwardly bombastic and crude manner ) gives Camiel much to learn - and gives the audience some touching and tender thoughts on which to dwell . The film is a fun , at times naughty , smart , and ultimately life-affirming tale about the importance of friendship and family . . . and a strong sense of humor . . . that are the stuff that allow us to survive even the most difficult of moments in life . The entire cast is excellent but the performances by Cees Geel as Simon and Marcel Hensema as Camiel Vrolijk are worthy of awards . This is an extravagantly fun film , completely open and honest about its sexuality , that results in a memorable emotional experience for the viewer . In Dutch with English subtitles . Grady Harp
513279	3223254	405866	8.0	Chabrol's Newest Intrigue Puzzle , but One with Missing Pieces	The films of French Cinema master Claude Chabrol have been some of the quirkier , intelligent , strange , and creative works to come out of France ( La Fleur du mal , Merci pour le chocolat , Au coeur du mensonge , Rien ne va plus , La Cérémonie , L'Enfer , Madame Bovary , Dr . M , etc ) . His works are marked with sinister underpinnings and his technique has been to place his characters in situations that challenge them to behaviors they consider bizarre until they understand the core of their somewhat deranged personalities . LA DEMOISELLE D'HONNEUR ( THE BRIDESMAID ) succeeds as a art work on so many levels that the viewer is inclined to forgive some of the dangling missing pieces in character and plot development that prevent this film from being Chabrol's finest . The setting , pacing , cast and concept are intriguingly seductive : that is enough to make the film work well . The Tardieu family is in the midst of preparing for the wedding of one daughter Sophie ( Solène Bouton ) , learning to accept the new love affair of the mother Christine ( Aurore Clément ) to a wealthy newly divorced man Gérard ( Bernard Le Coq ) , becoming used to the edgy antisocial behavior of daughter Patricia ( Anna Mihalcea ) , and all the while being cared for by the successful contractor son Philippe ( Benoît Magimel ) . On the television is the report of a murdered young woman and the disruption of a television show frustrates the obsessive Philippe in his work to keep the family focused . We jump to Sophie's wedding to nerdy Jacky ( Eric Seigne ) whose cousin Stéphanie " Senta " Bellange ( Laura Smet ) is the bridesmaid of the title . The strange but sensuous Senta captures Philippe's eye and a rather torrid love affair begins . Senta is passionate and makes Philippe agree to four demands to prove he loves her : the last two ( killing someone / anyone ) and having sex with a same sex partner ) jolt Philippe but he throws his usual caution to the wind and proceeds with the pairing . A homeless man who lives at Senta's grimy cellar lodging door repulses her , and when a police report that the man has been found dead , Philippe falsely ' confides ' to Senta that he is responsible . Senta then promises to kill Gérard as her half of the bargain : Gérard has avoided Philippe's mother and Philippe feels animosity toward anyone who would disturb his beloved mother . The plot thickens , then boils : the ' murders ' change from reality to mistaken identity to heinous ends . Philippe has become immersed in Senta's madness , leaving an ending that remains ' in media res ' . Chabrol leaves strange clues scattered about for the astute eye to discover , at times in retrospect , and it is this trait that makes the story so fascinating . The cast is superb , with Benoît Magimel proving that his success in ' The Pianist ' was not a fluke . He is a gifted actor and maintains an electrifying screen presence . This may not be Chabrol's best film , but it is twisted enough to keep the viewer tensely focused on the very strange story and on the complexly interesting set of characters in this very French film noir !

512914	3223254	489281	8.0	Afterburn	The title of this film STOP-LOSS may puzzle many . According to Wikipedia , ' Stop-loss , in the United States military , is the involuntary extension of a service member's active duty service under the enlistment contract in order to retain them beyond their initial end of term of service ( ETS ) date . It also applies to the cessation of a permanent change of station ( PCS ) move for a member still in military service ' . According to writer ( with Mark Richard ) / director Kimberly Pierce ( whose previous ' Boy's Don't Cry ' tackled similarly volatile issues ) , the impetus for making this film about the effects of war on veterans returning home was her viewing of videos taken by soldiers while actively engaged in battle in Iraq : this is the first war where the soldiers have actually photographed their own experiences , documenting the realities / horrors of war on the now popular video equipment at their disposal . It is a solid idea for a film , but somehow the idea gets diluted in the script . Texas homeboys who have just returned from the Iraq war are greeted with a parade and medals and empty rhetoric , but find adapting to reentry into their native land is fraught with the deeply embedded mental wounds of their experience : interpersonal relationships fall apart , families face altered personalities in their sons , Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome reigns . Brandon ( Ryan Phillippe ) blames himself for the deaths of his men , Tommy ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) drinks himself toward suicide , Rico ( Victor Rasuk ) attempts to see past his traumatically missing limbs , Isaac ( Rob Brown ) finds his entire world out of focus , and Steve ( Channing Tatum ) sees the military as his only point of reality to a life of success . When Brandon receives his Stop-Loss instead of his discharge papers his world turns upside down and he flounders in his nightmares and his need for escape to Canada or Mexico with his friend Michelle ( Abbie Cornish ) . The horror of events that follow the homecoming of these damaged soldiers culminates in a tragedy that somehow results in the soldiers following the orders of the governmental Stop-Loss orders . And that is the worst tragedy . Though the message is important , the delivery of it gets hazy : the motivations of the characters are too loosely defined to convince us of their terrible plights . But the impact on the public should be a wake-up call on the extended damage of war - any war - on the men and women who experience it first hand and carry the mental scars for life . For that reason , if for no other , this is a film that should be seen . Grady Harp
513349	3223254	396171	8.0	A Visual Masterwork	PERFUME - THE STORY OF A MURDERER may not succeed on every level . Based on the novel DAS PERFUM by Patrick Süskind and prepared for the screen by Andrew Birkin , Bernd Eichinger , and director Tom Tykwer , this is a story more about the senses than about people . The main character is not the sort of man with whom we can identify , but the progress of this crazed youth into the olfactory madness of serial killing for the sake of creating perfumes does provide an opportunity to study life in the 18th century in a way seldom available for viewers . It is clumsy in spots , protracted in length , and a bit tedious in the telling , but visually this is a movie that is a feast ( ? ) for the eyes . Jean-Baptiste Grenouille ( Ben Wishaw ) is born in poverty and while he is thought to be stillborn , he survives and is found to have an extraordinary sense of smell . His youth is spent in work houses and slavery until one famous Italian perfumer Giuseppe Baldini ( Dustin Hoffman ) , living in Paris , discovers Grenouille's gifts and takes him on as an apprentice . The lad learns the technique of vaporizing and boiling essences but when he asks Baldini how to capture the smell of ' anything at all ' ( particularly the scent of women ) , Baldini sends him off to study the technique of ' enfleurage ' , a manner of embedding flowers in fat until their essences are absorbed yield a pure form in the distillation of the melted fat . Grenouille begins to capture women to coat them in fat to obtain their scent and in doing so he begins his cycle of murders of the victims . When he encounters the lass Laura ( Rachel Hurd-Wood ) who would steal his attention , her father Richis ( Alan Rickman ) finally puts and ending to the macabre tale of Perfume . In many ways , though the cast performs well , the star of the production is the cinematography by Frank Griebe and the accompanying musical score by Reinhold Heil , Johnny Klimek , and ( yes ) Tom Tykwer . At 147 minutes the movie is too long for the story , but the setting and moods created are well worth watching . Grady Harp
513544	3223254	450470	8.0	' Two drifters , off to see the world ' from " Moon River "	Director João Pedro Rodrigues and writer Paulo Rebelo ( ' O Fantasma ' ) collaborate again on this fascinating ( if a bit frustrating ) Portuguese film ODETE ( ' Two Drifters ' ) . Together they have their own brand of surrealism and exploration of fantasies that seems to be developing into a smart new look for cinema . The very controversial ' O Fantasma ' was dark and brooding , tearing open psyches like feral dogs along the slums of Portugal , whereas ' Two Drifters ' is a work in the daylight that moves the concentration from men only to men and women - but the extremes of behavior are still in sharp focus . The film opens with a very tender moment between handsome student Pedro ( João Carreira ) and his working boyfriend Rui ( Nuno Gil ) : it is their anniversary but their individual obligations prevent them from spending more than a hasty goodbye , exchanging rings , and off goes Pedro in his car only to be killed in a crash . Devastated , Rui attends to Pedro and then to the horror of sitting by his casket during the wake before the funeral . Flash into storyline two : the beautiful store skater Odete ( Ana Cristina De Oliveira ) lives with her lover Alberto ( the hunky Carloto Cotta ) but when she announces she would like to have a child , Alberto flees and Odete is left in depression over her plight . She just happens to be a neighbor of the recently dead Pedro and in her loneliness she attends Pedro's wake , follows the casket through the funeral and to the grave where she begins to obsess over the dead Pedro . She spends her time draped across his grave , fantasizes that she is pregnant by him and confronts Pedro's mother with the concept . She truly has pseudosiesis ( false imagined hysterical pregnancy ) and when it is an exposed condition she alters her appearance , cutting her hair and wearing Pedro's clothes and even convincing Pedro's mother to let her sleep in his bed . Ultimately Odete , now inhabiting the persona of Pedro , rejects Albert's return to her graces and instead enters into a bizarre arrangement with Rui . The actors are all physically beautiful people , superbly cast to fit the models of the personalities of the story , and they manage to make this rather incredible tale credible . The film is rich in symbolism and metaphors , among them the title of the English version ' Two Drifters ' - a phrase taken form the favorite fantasy song ' Moon River ' that is the theme of Pedro's and Rui's relationship . There are some distorted sexual scenes and innuendos that may be off-putting to some , but the inclusion works for the story . It is a tough little film but dazzling in its brave little way of taking chances , making us eager to see what João Pedro Rodrigues will do next ! Grady Harp
513227	3223254	406650	9.0	The Oblivion of Suburbia : A Dark Comedy	Few films have polarized audiences ( fortunate enough to have experienced this little film ) as much as THE CHUMSCRUBBER , a film that is unique in its brave depiction of American suburbia , a place where ' things ' have absorbed our attention and ' people ' have all but melted into the woodwork . It is a dark comedy , and even while it is very funny in parts , the humor is always attached to black vignettes that are so truthful they can become terrifying . Taking place in some manufactured instant suburb in sunny California , the story ( by director and co-writer Arie Posin with Zak Stanford ) is framed around one Dean Stiffle ( Jamie Bell - think of the meaning of the word stifle ! ) , a lad who seemingly is alone among the hollow shells of high school kids who live through drugs / pills to alter their perception of a boring meaningless world . The source of their pills is Troy Johnson ( Josh Janowicz ) who in the first frames of the movie is discovered by Dean after Troy has hanged himself in suicide . Dean , though terrified at the horror of what he discovers , decides to not tell anyone ' because who would care anyway ' . Life just goes on among the parents of the teenagers , not allowing anything to disturb their shallow lives : Troy's mother ( Glenn Close ) appears oblivious to her loss ; Dean's mother ( Allison Janney ) is more concerned with cooking and is clueless as to interpersonal relationships with anyone including her author / psychologist husband William Fichtner whose world begins and ends in his latest book ; Terry Bratley ( Rita Wilson ) whose time is consumed by her incipient wedding to the mayor ( Ralph Fiennes ) who has delusional behavior while fending off maladaptive behavior by her recently divorced spouse Officer Lou ( John Heard ) ; Mrs . Falls ( Carrie-Anne Moss ) who seduces even teenagers and any other man who comes into her gaze . These shells of parents have no clue or communication with their aimless kids , but the kids when discovering the source of their pills is dead , decide to go after psycho Dean to get the stash . In doing so they kidnap Charley whom they think is Dean's brother to convince Dean to raid Troy's stash . The manner in which all of this plays out is a veritable horror story of the amoral mindset of teenagers coping alone in the world with parents who elect to remain oblivious to their plights . There are some lapses in continuity with the story , some editing problems , and some weak moments , but the overall message is a very dark , very real microscopic examination of our society . Jamie Bell is particularly outstanding as Dean , the only character who appears to have a remnant of conscience and soul . But the cameos by the wide range of stars are splendid . James Horner has once again managed to gel the story with his musical score , ending the credits with a rendition of the Graham Nash song " Our House ' . As said before , the audience is polarized between love and hate / tolerance for this film . This viewer happened to love it . Recommended for all people concerned with our youth today - and their inadequate parents . Grady Harp
513360	3223254	362526	9.0	A Big Bravo ! for this California Transplant from Argentina !	As one of the many foreign film devotees who rank writer Fabián Bielinsky's 2000 film NUEVE REINAS from Argentina as one of the best caper films ever , I was completely satisfied with the ' American made version ' CRIMINAL . Bielinsky co-wrote this screenplay with director Gregory Jacobs and the result is a terse , witty , fascinating , intelligent film that deserves 5 stars in every category . Transposing the story ( which takes place in one day ) to Los Angeles opens up even more avenues of social comment than the original . The use of the various areas of LA that span from the wealth of Beverly Hills to the grandeur of the downtown Biltmore Hotel to the scruffy East LA neighborhoods and other underbellies of Sun City truly match the flow of the story . Smarmy Richard Gaddis ( John C . Reilly ) is a small time crook who has experienced every aspect of con games . He dresses like a businessman , drives a Mercedes , and believes that if you're going to con the wealth out of money ( which he does without conscience ) , you must look professional . He observes Rodrigo ( Diego Luna ) in a cafe doing some very minor con games and when Rodrigo is apparently ' caught ' , Richard acts the part of a vice officer and saves Rodrigo from being arrested . Here begins their partnership : Richard needs a sideman to assist in an important grifter scheme involving selling a valuable money bill ( instead of the stamps with nine queens of the original ) ; Rodrigo ( who Richard re-names Brian to Anglicize him so he won't appear a Cholo ) needs big money to pay off his father's gambling debt . Through a series of introductory can games they learn to ' trust ' each other and the big game begins . The fast and furious process of the big grift flows with many incidents that are clever , convincingly intriguing , and introduces many characters in its path , each of whom plays a more major role than anyone would expect . . . Maggie Gylenhaal as Richard's sister Valerie ( concierge at the Biltmore ) is pulled in unwillingly only after she forces a ' truth session ' involving Richard's cheating on their inheritance in front of their brother Michael ( Jonathan Tucker ) , the original forger of the bill Ochoa ( Zitto Kazaan ) , the hit who buys the bill Hannigan ( Peter Muller ) , and all of the apparent bit people in the scheme are superb . Throughout the story Rodrigo / Brian is portrayed as warm , lovable smalltime beginner , though always ready with a clever intervention , and Richard is the know-it-all conflicted ' boss ' . How this relationship mutates is just plain fine writing and acting and the ending of the film is a terrific surprise even to those who know NUEVE REINAS well ! Reilly and Luna are perfect choices for these multifaceted roles . Highly Recommended !
513202	3223254	1175491	9.0	A Film The Will Gain Respect In Time	W . is a film not many people want to see or even discuss because of the subject matter - the career of the country's most unpopular President , the debacle of the Iraq War , and the decimated economy . There is a certain ' guilt ' that comes with criticizing the leader of the country , from both conservatives and liberals : it is not polite to condemn our elected leaders . But now with the Bush legacy daily being pushed into the past ( though the after burn of that embarrassing 8 years will never completely go away ) , it is time for biographers to examine why the Bush version of Presidential autonomy occurred . Oliver Stone has examined Nixon and JFK on film and now with a terse script Stanley Weiser he summarizes the life of George W . Bush , from his early bad boy drinking years and inability to hold a job through his family collisions ( brother Jeb being the obvious successor to George Bush , Sr . ) , to his bull headed drive toward absolute power to finish the war his father didn't finish - securing the Middle East oil fields to be held by American control by fabricating the infamous Axis of Evil and Weapons of Mass Destruction as drivers to light the preemptive blundering war against Saddam Hussein and Iraq . In lesser hands this film might have become too prejudiced a view of a president . But Oliver Stone's technique of telling a story makes this film work : we see the rise and fall of a pitifully misguided man whose judgment and lack of intelligence brought us to where we are today . Much of the success of the film is due to the casting of Josh Brolin as W . , James Cromwell as Bush Sr . , Ellen Burstyn as Barbara Bush , Richard Dreyfuss as the terrifying Dick Cheney , Jeffrey Wright as Colin Powell , Elizabeth Banks as Laura Bush , Scott Glenn as Donald Rumsfeld , Toby Jones as Karl Rove , Bruce McGill as George Tenet , and a puzzling performance by Thandie Newton as Condoleeza Rice . Their characterizations are remarkable and give an insider's view as to the tehniques used to change a democracy into an oligarchy . Many people may find this film either too biased and cruel ( conservatives ) or too watered down ( liberals ) , but at least Oliver Stone has once again placed a key figure on the screen for us all to ponder . In time this film will be better accepted , once the smoke clears from the past 8 eight years . Grady Harp
512694	3223254	181396	9.0	The Sudden Fires of Adolescence that Create Maturity	COME TE NUSSUNO MAI translates from Italian to " like you anyone ever " or one's first experiences in life are unique solely to you , never having been experienced by anyone in history . BUT FOREVER IN MY MIND is simply a quote lifted from this film about the agonies and ecstasies of adolescence and to fully appreciate the story from the adolescent aspect , the Italian title is far more appropriate . As written by brothers Gabriele and Silvio Muccino ( also Gabriele directs and Silvio stars ) this radiant little film covers a day in the lives of Italian highschool kids caught up in a youthful rebellion against their school's policies while at the same time sorting out the nascent changes in their burgeoning sexuality . The boys languish over their expected , anxiously awaited first physical encounter while the girls ( at times on split screen just to make the comparison more strongly ) relate their feelings about first time encounters with the boys . The two stories run parallel : student riots involve the police and of course eventually their parents , the two sources of authority the kids naturally challenge , and the taste of honey one of the boys achieves which becomes a gossiped , bloated misdirected moment of braggadocio that eventually leads to the serendipitous beautifully innocent discovery of teenage love . The young boys include Silvio ( Silvio Muccino ) and his talkative confident Ponzi ( Giuseppe Sanfelice ) , the one sexually active lad Martino ( Simone Pagani ) while the girls include the experienced Valentina ( Giulia Carmignani ) partner of Martino , and Claudia ( Giulia Steigerwalt ) , Silvio's longtime friend who dreams of a relationship beyond friendship . The remainder of the cast ( especially Enrico Silvestrin and Giulia Ciccone who are splendid as Silvio's ' ex-hippie ' parents ) is quite strong . The parallel between the physical rebellion in the school incident and the hormonal rebellion within this collected group's bodies is a true sense of cinematic metaphor and makes for a fast-paced , humorous , touching coming of age story that is a joy to watch ! In Italian with English subtitles . Grady Harp
512641	3223254	446059	9.0	A Fitting Valedictory for Jet Li	Jet Li has been an impressive presence in film as a martial arts practitioner and choreographer both in his native China and in his US films . He has selected FEARLESS as his final film as a martial artist and a better choice of story for a final bow could not be imagined . Based on the life of Chinese Martial Arts Master Huo Yuanjia ( 1869-1910 ) , the founder and spiritual leader of the Jin Wu Sports Federation still in existence internationally , Jet Li acts the role of Huo Yuanjia , a man whose father's heroics were surpassed only by his compassion , a trait the film shows us to be the lesson learned by Huo Yuanjia . Beginning with his childhood where all of his influences and those people who altered his life are introduced by child actors ( the weakest portion of this film ) , he grows into the role as champion Washu fighter of his province , but his championship is not without problems : he inadvertently kills his final opponent opening a series of tragedies that drives him , a broken man , into the rural area of China where he learns the simple life and ideals of his people . He returns to his province to visit the sites of his family's memorials and the memorial of the man he killed . He further accepts a challenge to fight again only this time despite onerous odds he allows his spiritual awakening to govern the outcome . The film is lushly beautiful with some of the finest cinematography of China we have yet to see . The choreography of the fight sequences is superb and Jet Li commits his all to the role both as actor and martial arts fighter . The audience is left feeling a new sense of respect for the travails of China at the early part of the 20th century , for the field of Marital Arts , for the dignity of one of China's heroes , and for the performer / actor Jet Li . It is a most fitting valedictory . Grady Harp
513459	3223254	462477	10.0	A Brilliant Little Film Opens the Window to an Unknown Profession	PIERREPOINT : THE LAST HANGMAN is one of those films that emerges from the cracks in the theater ' failures ' only to find its poignant message when released on DVD . Granted , the idea of a story based on England's most famous executioner doesn't immediately catch the interest of the general audience , but for those fortunate enough to either rent or buy this DVD , the rewards are plentiful . It is a little masterpiece of writing , acting , directing and production values . Albert Pierrepoint was the third man in his family to ' ascend ' to the list of executioners ( capital punishment in England at the time was by hanging ) , and when he is accepted to the list in 1932 he begins what became the longest and most prolific career of British executioners . He took enormous pride in his work , assuring his peers as well as his ' victims ' that every aspect of his job was done with obsessive professionalism : his timing of his duties was the shortest on record , meaning that from the moment he opened the door to the condemned prisoner's room through the hooding and noose placement and tripping of the platform and subsequent death of the ' criminal ' , he spared suffering as much as was feasible . He was supported by a wife who kept the secret of her husband's anonymous role and it was only when the Pierrepoint's pride in his job became known that downfall of their lives is threatened . At times adored by the public for his assignment to hand the Nazi criminals and the famous murderers and eventually the target of the anti capital punishment activists , Pierrepoint's professionalism sustained him until a final tragic assignment changed his view of his job . Timothy Spall is splendid as Pierrepoint , capturing all of the nuances of the simple , honest man's pride as well as his Achilles ' heel . Juliet Stevenson turns in yet another understated and completely realized role as Pierrepoint's wife . Director Adrian Shergold , using a script written by Bob Mills and Jeff Pope , paces the film sensitively , drawing on the atrocious duties involved in the job of executioner ( they actually had to prepare the bodies of the dead victims for the morticians ! ) along with the moments of pub frivolity to allow the audience to understand the true person Timothy Spall absorbs in his portrayal of Pierrepoint . The sets and lighting and cinematography could not be better . This is a film to view and absorb and appreciate the superior quality of acting of Spall and Stevenson . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
513401	3223254	388395	10.0	A Heartwarming Journey Into Retired Living !	SCHULTZE GETS THE BLUES is one of the more poetic films about aging and the choices people make at points of life-change as any to date . The utter simplicity of technique that writer / director Michael Schorr uses to tell this quiet tale of the glory of the human spirit is magical . This is one of those films that deserves a very wide audience from every age group ! Schultze ( Horst Krause ) , Jürgen ( Harald Warmbrunn ) and Manfred ( Karl Fred Müller ) have just been retired from their life's occupation of working the salt mines in a bleak little German town , and are left to ' celebrate ' ( with their company ' trophy lamps ' made of large illuminated salt crystals ! ) , drink beer , and ponder their next step : retired life . Of the three , Schultze is the loner , his wife in an extended care facility for the mentally challenged where Schultze plays his accordion polkas for their entertainment . The woman in charge Frau Lorant ( Rosemarie Deibel ) encourages Schultze to further his interest in his accordion . Manfred and Jürgen insist he play polka music and enter a contest in America . But Schultze has heard zydeco music on the radio ( zydeco = a style of dance music originating in Louisiana that is usually played on accordion , guitar , and violin and combines traditional French melodies with Caribbean and blues influences ) and becomes quietly obsessed with that music . Off to America to compete in a Texan Polka Contest , loner Schultze wanders to Louisiana where he finds not only the music of his soul but a people who accept him more than his little German hometown . And the gentle message of this quiet little film is about loneliness and friendship and the impact they make on us all . Schorr spends the bulk of this two-hour journey with visuals that depict isolation , longing , and the small things that make up what we call life . His cast is superb , with Horst Krause's Schultze creating one of the most memorable characters on film . In a time when Baby Boomers are looking at retirement with anxiety , this little movie is just the antidote . Highly Recommended ! Grady Harp , October 05
513146	3223254	386342	10.0	Fragility and Strength : A Study of Family	' Brødre ' ( ' Brothers ' ) is a remarkable film from Denmark written by Anders Thomas Jensen and Susanne Bier who also directs this microscopic examination of the intricacies of family bonding , the significance of the blood ties between brothers , and the effects of one of the brutal realities of war on every individual member of a family . It is a tense drama made palpable by some phenomenal acting and direction . Michael ( Ulrich Thomsen ) and Jannik ( Nikolaj Lie Kaas ) are polar opposites as brothers : Michael is his father's dream , a man who is committed to his family , his beautiful and devoted wife Sarah ( Connie Nielsen ) with whom he has two daughters , while Jannik is a carefree drifter who drinks too much and refuses to have the stable life his parents expect of him . Michael is off to war in Afghanistan and is in a tragic helicopter accident and reported as dead . When Sarah is informed her world crumbles , as does the mental state of her father-in-law . Jannik hears the news while drunk but slowly awakens to the awful reality that his brother is gone and his sister-in-law and nieces need the support he has never been able to muster . In Afghanistan we discover that Sarah's inclination that Michael is not really dead is true : Michael has been captured by the Taliban and the experience as a prisoner changes him indelibly , breaking his shell of perfection and he becomes vulnerable and fragile . When Michael returns home to the surprise of everyone the dynamics that have reversed between the family and Jannik and the force that bonds Michael and Jannik is challenged and we are left to examine the fallout . The script in Danish is supplemented with excellent subtitles in English , but one wonders if the words are even necessary - so fine is the acting of every actor involved . Connie Nielson is a major force in cinema today , a brilliant actor whose spectrum of dynamics appears endless . Both Thomsen and Kaas are equally fine in their difficult roles . This is a superlative work , a psychological drama that strikes chords of familiarity on many levels . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
512973	3223254	352248	10.0	Brother can you spare a dime . . .	Not being a fan of boxing I usually avoid movies about the sport unless there is some other reason for watching ( as in Million Dollar Baby , the initial Rocky film ) : the idea of watching two people beat each other bloody while crazy crowds cheer just doesn't register as entertainment ( the American gladiator syndrome ) . And while Cinderella MAN is clearly about the game of boxing , the true story of a real boxer , and contains long spans of beatings , this film is not so much about boxing as it is about the indomitable human spirit . It is also one of the finest films depicting the Great Depression in the 1930s that is a timely moment for us all to remember . . . In 1928 Jim Braddock ( Russell Crowe ) was a top contender for boxing fame , supporting his wife Mae ( Renée Zellweger ) and three children , wisely investing his earnings form his winning fights in the reliable stock market , devoting his time to his family and securing their future . Then 1929 happened and the stock market crash destroyed his savings and damaged his ability to fight , plunging him into the mass of poverty accompanied by nearly all Americans . Jim and Mae struggle to feed and clothe their children , and Jim is unable to win at boxing , becomes a ' loser ' , loses his license , and survives by daily showing up at the docks for the negligible chance of work . The times are bleak , and there is a moment when Mae shifts the children around to family members because they have no food or heat . But Jim's fight manager Joe Gould ( Paul Giamatti ) , himself surviving the bad times under a hollow facade , manages to gain Jim a fight . Despite his advancing age , broken hands , fallen reputation , and challenged ego , Jim manages to sustain his spirit and fights for the survival of his family . The rest is history . Ron Howard directs this story of a man's indomitable spirit with a fine sense of pacing and manages to hold this two and a half hour movie together without a moment of wasted time . With cinematographer Salvatore Totino and musical score writer Thomas Newman he manages to recreate the gray brown mood of the Great Depression better than any film to date . There are small supporting roles that truly shine : the grossly underused Paddy Considine , Craig Bierko , and Bruce McGill among them are beautifully carved creations . Russell Crowe gives his most understated , credible role and truly inhabits ' Cinderella Man ' ( his moniker ) as a desperately needed hero of the people of the Depression Era . Renée Zellweger once again plays , well . . . Renée Zellweger . The surprising acting comes from the solid support by Paul Giamatti . If he isn't nominated for best supporting actor then people aren't watching ! Cinderella MAN is a strong film , one that sweeps you up and carries you along - even if you don't care about boxing !

512949	3223254	74084	10.0	Returning to 1900	Though this epic drama by Bernardo Bertolucci was originally released thirty years ago , revisiting the film , now available in its entirety of 315 minutes , is like reading a favorite old classical history novel . Bertolucci obviously loved this story of two disparate boys , one from wealth and privilege and the other from peasant worker status , born on the same day in 1900 who proceed through the year 1945 , bonded by country , intertwined by a developing friendship , and separating on political views . It is a film that examines capitalism versus socialism , Communism versus Fascism , two World Wars , and the effects that the changing political milieu of Italy had on the lives and loves of two men and their respective families . Of course this summation is far too brief for a film of over five hours in length , but the beauty of the film is the slow manner in which this set of ideas unfolds . The actors include not only such durable stars as Robert De Niro , Gérard Depardieu , Dominique Sanda , Burt Lancaster , Donald Sutherland , and Sterling Hayden , but also some of Italy's finest actors and an entire town of ' naturals ' , adding a sense of verismo to the film . The cinematography Vittorio Storaro is simply breathtaking and the musical score is by the inimitable Ennio Morricone . A mega-budget epic , the money seems well spent in retrospect . This is Bertolucci as an artist , a craftsman , an intellectual , and a committed politician . The DVD is somewhat hampered by the fact that the film was filmed in both English and Italian with two sets of dubbing choices and if the viewer has a problem with dubbing , then it is inescapable here . Despite this rather minor flaw , 1900 remains a film unlike any other in giving us a flavor of a country torn by the realities that the world faced in the first half of the 20th century . It is a long song , but well worth the time invested to absorb it all . Grady Harp
513722	3223254	918927	10.0	A Message of Profound Importance Delivered by a Brilliant Ensemble	DOUBT succeeds on every level - from the fine transference of Patrick Shanley's play to the screen ( Shanley wrote the play , the screenplay , and directs ) to the atmospheric cinematography excursion through the Bronx of the mid 1960s to the detailed delineation of the characters by Meryl Streep , Viola Davis , Amy Adams , Phillip Seymour Hoffman , and even young Joseph Foster , to the careful editing . It would be difficult to imagine a finer cast , here cast in roles counter to their usual types , bringing such power to the poetry of Shanley's lines . The story is well known by now ( the dismissal of a progressive priest by a crotchety old Catholic school principal over a false rumor and all the ' doubt ' that brings into play in every character ) , but multiple viewings of this film intensify the humanity of each of the characters and demonstrate just how fine a writer Shanley is . The subject matter is difficult at first but the manner in which each of these superb actors ( under the guidance of Shanley's direction ) explore the effects of spite and loathing and forgiveness shares some of the finest ensemble acting in years . Recommended . Grady Harp
513482	3223254	299478	10.0	Bergman and the Joys of his Film Concerts	For many years the films of Ingmar Bergman have haunted us , films that dare to enter territories untouched by others , peopled by actors of consummate skill , extended monologues both spoken and silent , and secret doors into the souls of some of the most fascinating characters created for the screen . SARABAND is no exception : this theme and variations is written and performed and directed to perfection . It leaves the viewer speechless . Marianne ( Liv Ullmann ) is a successful lawyer in her 60s who returns to her ex-husband's solitary retreat just for a visit . Her ex-husband Johan ( Erland Josephson ) , since remarried and re-divorced , has a son Henrik ( Börje Ahlstedt ) by another wife who lives nearby on the lake : Henrik is a musician and writer and lives with his daughter Karin ( Julia Dufvenius ) , teaching her cello in preparation for an audition at the music conservatory . What Marianne finds after thirty years absence is that Johan and Henrik are on bitter terms , that Karin is frustrated with her demanding teacher / father , and that the recurring ' saraband ' movement of this story is the mutual adoration and mourning of Anna , Karin's mother and Henrik's deceased wife . Marianne and Johan muse over their past lives , discovering that despite circumstances they still love each other . Marianne is able to open the hearts of Karin , Johan , and Henrik and provide a tender voice that brings a degree of resolution to a family broken . As with all of Bergman's films it is not the story content as the method in telling that makes his films so indelibly and quietly passionate . Everything is understated : solo sequences are played with Bach's solo cello suites , and when two or more characters interact the music becomes Brahms and Bruckner . This is an elegant pastoral about looking into the mirror of our souls in old age and finding both the beauties and the missed opportunities of a life now passing toward the end . Each of the four actors is splendid , though watching Liv Ullmann in her native tongue is a renaissance of memory of all the fine work this extraordinary actress has done . Bergman gives us an elegy not a eulogy and one can only hope for more . Highly recommended on every level . In Swedish with English subtitles . Grady Harp
513671	3223254	412080	10.0	A Beautiful , Touching , Entertaining Tale of Dreams and Aging	It seems many viewers avoided this film when it was in the theaters because the title was confusing and not representative of the story . The fact that Sir Anthony Hopkins was the lead actor should have been a signal of sorts , but it took the release of the DVD for this viewer to reluctantly rent the film when other possibilities were low . Big Mistake ! This is one of the more genuinely fine films about the idomitability of the human spirit that has been released in some time . Based on a true story , the ' Indian ' of the title has nothing to do with the heritage of the character Burt Munro , a 67 year old odd but generously kind New Zealander whose lifelong passion is to race his 1923 ' Indian motorbike ' in the Bonneville Salt Flats Races in America . Burt lives for his dreams and despite the fact that his idiosyncrasies befuddle his neighbors and townsfolk ( with the except of the little boy Tom next door who idolizes him ) , he manages to make everyone with whom he comes into contact admire , and yes , love him . Using his own skills he brings his old motorbike to the point that he can enter the race in the States and with the financial help of his friends he manages to board a ship with his bike and sail to America . In the US he is a fish out of water and must adjust to the city life and attitudes of the Americans , but eventually , through his innate charm and dedication to his dream , he does manage against all odds and , with the help of many American new friends , enter the race to break the world's record for speed on a motorbike . Hopkins owns the role of Burt and despite his not always on target New Zealand accent he manages to deliver surely one of his most endearing portrayals of his rich career . His encounters with Tom , with a feisty widow Ada ( Diane Ladd ) , with a fine old wise Indian man , and with a transsexual motel clerk Tina ( Chris Williams ) , to name only a few of the superb supporting cast - are the epitome of underplayed fine acting and engender so much warmth that tears of happiness just can't be avoided . Writer and director Roger Donaldson deserves a standing ovation for this small , sensitive , gentle , understated tale that demonstrates so well how being true to your visions and your dreams can overcome almost any obstacle . A deeply touching and completely entertaining movie . Highly Recommended for all audiences . This is one to Buy ! Grady Harp
512794	3223254	401383	10.0	Looking Out form a Locked-In Mind	Julian Schnabel , well accepted as one of the important visual artists of our time , continues to impress with his small but elite group of films , proving that paintings and cinema are closely related as a means to reach the psyche . In ' Le Scaphandre et le papillon ' ( ' The Diving Bell and the Butterfly ' ) he has transformed the memoir of Jean-Dominique Bauby ( with the sensitive screen adaptation by Ronald Harwood ) into an experience for the mind and the heart . It is an extraordinary blend of visual effects , poetry , exquisite acting , and the perseverance of the human mind to communicate with the world when all seeming variations of communication are stripped away . Jean-Dominique ( Jean-Do ) Bauby ( Mathieu Amalric ) was the editor of the French magazine ' Elle ' , living with the beautiful Céline Desmoulins ( Emmanuelle Seigner ) and their three children , when during a ride with his son he has a massive stroke that leaves him completely paralyzed ( the ' locked-in syndrome ' ) . When he awakens from his coma he is able to hear and to see but he cannot speak or move , except for his eyes . From this point we , the audience , experience the world as through the eyes of Jean-Do , share his frustrations of being unable to speak , and in his ultimately having to communicate through the fine skills of his speech therapist Henriette Durand ( Marie-Josée Croze ) by blinking his eye once or twice for yes or no as each letter of the alphabet is spoken - an arduous task for both patient and visitor . He decides he wants to write his memoirs and Claude ( Anne Consigny ) is assigned to take his ' dictation ' . The only faculties Jean-Do retains are his memory and his fantasies , and it is through the acting out of these that we discover the victim's private and secret life as well as his relationships to colleagues and lovers and family . He imagines the hospital where he is confined in the time of Nijinsky ( Nicolas Le Riche ) and Empress Eugénie ( Emma de Caunes ) and filters the realities of his life through the interactions with his comrades Laurent ( Isaach De Bankolé ) and others as well as vivid memories of his relationship with his father Papinou Bauby ( Max von Sydow ) . With the patient assistance of the health providers , friends and family he is able to complete his memoir , the story of a man locked in a diving bell longing for the freedom of a butterfly , released form its cocoon . . Getting used to the film technique Schnabel uses takes patience , but for those who are willing to accept the pace of the film , rich with fantasy and historical sequences , the impact is not only compelling but breathtaking . This telling of a true story is a fine work from all concerned and for this viewer it is one of the best films of recent years . Grady Harp
513245	3223254	382073	10.0	Serendipity as Chamber Music	Often a film succeeds because of the story , or the writing , or the cast , or the direction . HEIGHTS succeeds brilliantly because of the combination of all of these elements in one of the finest films of the past few years . Beginning with the play and screenplay by Amy Fox , and as carefully and lovingly directed by Chris Terrio with a sterling cast , this film works its subtle magic of a story about serendipity and coincidences and how these alter our lives by accidental occurrences . Or are they accidental ? Each of the well-drawn characters in this story is functioning at a level that involves the masks behind which we each hide our personal secrets or idiosyncrasies : each character is either at a ' height ' or approaching one , and it is the interplay of these disparate people that creates phrases of music which ultimately combine in a series of themes and variations like a well-composed work of chamber music . And this all occurs within a twenty-four hour period in Manhattan . Diana ( Glenn Close ) is the reigning New York actress currently preparing a production of ' Macbeth ' with friend director Henry ( Eric Bagosian ) while simultaneously giving Master Classes at Julliard to a group of acting students who she declares lack passion ! Diana's ' height ' is challenged by her current anxiety over her open-marriage husband's rather serious affair with one of her students . She holds auditions and a young , struggling , and handsome actor Alec ( Jesse Bradford ) catches her interest and she sees in him the passion she craves and invites him to her party that evening . Alec , fearful of his chance at his ' height ' , hesitantly accepts . Meanwhile Diana's photographer daughter Isabel ( Elizabeth Banks ) is fired from her portrait job only to be offered an important gig in Eastern Europe by an ex-lover , offering Isabel a chance at her own ' height ' . Isabel is engaged to young ambitious lawyer Jonathan ( James Marsden remembered for this superb acting in ' The 24th Day ' ) who in preparing to marry a non-Jew is in counseling with his Rabbi ( George Segal ) : there are obviously stresses on the incipient marriage that Jonathan has not revealed . In another area of Manhattan , at Vanity Fair , Liz ( Isabella Rosselini ) taps reporter Peter ( John Light ) to do a story on a famous and gifted photographer known for bedding his nude male models . Peter is to interview each of the models for the story , and one of those models happens to be Jonathan ! The entire group comes together at Diana's party and there the secrets of each of the characters gradually surface in coincidental ways and the story of how each of these interesting but tainted people respond to discoveries makes for the resolution of the story . Director Terrio uses finely honed techniques to slowly introduce each character , adding layers of information gradually , until the magnitude of these coincidences becomes dramatically tense and fascinating . This film is like standing in a darkroom watching a photograph slowly develop , revealing more of the details with each washing , until the final picture is filled with extraordinary details - some expected , others not . The cast is wholly superb and the degree of ensemble acting surpasses that of films of the recent past . If there is a criticism of the film it is a minor one : the ambient sound and musical scoring at times cover the dialog which make us strain to hear the whispered interchanges . But this is a brilliant film that immediately assumes a role in the pantheon of fine cinematic art . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
513706	3223254	401085	10.0	A Celebration of Familial Love and Individual Resilience	C . R . A . Z . Y . is a miraculous little film from Quebec written with pitch perfect dialogue by Jean-Marc Vallée and François Boulay , on whose memories of his own experiences the story is based , directed with tremendous zest and sensitivity by Jean-Marc Vallée , and with a cast of fine actors that would be impossible to duplicate . Yes , it really is that fine . The title of the film may put some people off as silly , so let it be said early on that the letters C . R . A . Z . Y . represent the first names of the sons of the Beaulieu family - and the fun , hilarious and touching story starts from there ! Christmas Day is the birth of Zachary Beaulieu ( impressive Marc-André Grondin as a young man and Émile Vallée as a youth ) , the fourth son of Gervais Beaulieu ( a brilliant Michel Côté ) and his seemingly perpetually pregnant wife Laurianne Beaulieu ( Danielle Proulx , a superb actress ) , and at his birth he is immediately dropped on the floor , ' dies ' for a few seconds , and is resuscitated , a fact which later leads his mother to consult her Tupperware friend / seer about Zachary's power from God to heal other people . The children include Raymond who is a boisterous youth and later a worthless drifter / panhandler ( played by Pierre-Luc Brilliant as a young man but also played as a youth by Emmanuel Raymond and Antoine Côté-Potvin ) ; Christian ( Maxime Tremblay as a young man and Jean-Alexandre Létourneau as a youth ; Antoine ( Alex Gravel as a young man and Sébastien Blouin as a youth ; and Yvan ( Félix-Antoine Despatie and Gabriel Lalancette ) . Each brother has a particular personality , whether a bookworm , an athlete , a ne're-do-well or a dreamer and we watch the family adapt to each of the brothers ' idiosyncrasies . But it is Zachary who is the focal point as he struggles with his sexual identity from childhood on through his teenage denial years while dating a girl , to his final longing for the unreachable relationship with a man as an adult . His ' powers ' of healing he uses to great advantage for his family and he gradually becomes disenchanted with the omnipresent Catholic Church , a force that plays heavily in his fantasy life and dreams and fears . As the years pass from 1960 to 1971 we are allow to watch a family connect , fragment and ultimately survive , always bound to traditions of holiday and love . Gervais claims all of the good points of his boys as patterned after him , yet as he faces Zachary's possibly being gay he balks and it is only after a mesmerizing life changing experience Zachary undergoes that Zachary and Gervais finally find the mutual love they have both needed . Though the film is long ( running time is over two hours ) the film seems to fly past us like a comet of experience to which we all can relate . The performances are so very powerful that they sweep us away with the amount of love they exhibit : Danielle Proulx as the mother is so subtle in the little things she does for her beloved though at times wayward sons that she glows and Michel Côté steals the screen as a father searching for understanding of his crew of crazy boys . But the revelation is Marc-André Grondin's embodiment of Zachary that is nothing short of a miracle of acting . There is not a weak moment in this little masterpiece of film-making and one hopes that it will be released and widely publicized in the theaters in the USA as it deserves standing ovations ! Highly recommended . Grady Harp
513658	3223254	212712	10.0	Bits and Pieces of Love Stories from a Writer's Mind : A Wondrous Journey	Kar Wai Wong is more than a film director ( though he is one of the finest directors working today ! ) : he is a visual , poetic , creative and daring artist capable of more cinematic miracles in one isolated film than most directors achieve in a lifetime . ' 2046 ' is a visually stunning , intellectually challenging , emotionally charged view of love and lust in today's kinetically dysfunctional society . There is no one way to interpret this non-linear film and therein lies much of its rewards . The main character Chow ( Tony Leung ) is a writer and a libertine who has pushed his vacuous life around with his hormones and though he has had many affairs he has failed to find the illusory ' love ' . He has lived in Singapore and Hong Kong , makes his living writing columns of newspapers while his novels formulate in his mind . One of his novels is called ' 2046 ' , the title based on the room number in a hotel where he witnessed a bizarre incident involving a gorgeous woman , and resulted in his moving into the adjoining room 2047 where is meets the hotel manager's daughter in love with a Filipino Japanese man her father loathes . He desires this unattainable woman and fuses her with a fictional ' android ' in his novel which now uses ' 2046 ' as a year or time or place where people go to find memories . He continues to encounter women for whom he desires more than surface relationships ( there is a stunning lady gambler cameo who represents everything he lusts and longs for , etc ) but he is never able to find his tenuous ideal : his memory is his only source of consolation . The actors in every role include many of the finest actors available : Li Gong , Ziyi Zhang , Carina Lau , Maggie Cheung , Takuya Kimura , Chen Chang , and of course Tony Leung . But it is Kar Wai Wong , the writer , director , choreographer , colorist , visionary that makes this excursion into the interstices of the mind / imagination so overwhelmingly satisfying . Whether the viewer elects to view the story as a continuation of the director's previous films , or as reality vs memory , fiction vs imagination , sci-fi excursion , or simply a plethora of vignettes about the challenges of finding love in a world geared toward instant gratification , this is a magnificent achievement . In many ways the sound track could be turned off ( though the beautiful musical score by Peer Raben and Shigeru Umebayashi with a lot of help from Maria Callas ! would be missed ) , and the inventive cinematography and visual image manipulations by Christopher Doyle , Pung-Leung Kwan and Yiu-Fai Lai such as the constant dividing of the screen into triptychs and diptychs would remain some of the most beautiful photographic images on film . This is not an easy film to follow and it is most assuredly one that will grow in importance with repeated viewings . The comparison with Alain Resnais ' ' Last Year at Marienbad ' suggests its potency . But free the mind and enter into the world of ' 2046 ' for one of the most satisfying cinematic achievements of the recent past . Very highly recommended . Grady Harp
512661	3223254	362582	10.0	A Fine Study of the Wounds of Abandonment	El Día que me amen ( WHEN SOMEBODY LOVES ME ) is an important film from Argentina that bravely examines the spectrum of the effects of ' abandonment ' in childhood and how that seemingly minor act can transform lives . Based on a story idea by lead actor Adrián Suar and written for the screen by Marcos Carnevale and Marcela Guerty , this powerful movie steps beyond conventional tales of the distancing of childhood friends and moves into the arena of mental dysfunction and the long road to healing . Joaquín ( Adrián Suar ) and Mara ( Leticia Brédice ) are first seen as early 30s young adults , though their intimate childhood companionship is sensitively shown in flashbacks that appear like old home movies . Mara is an actress who has been traveling the world searching for a career and finally returns to Argentina for a chance to appear in a musical production of ' The Hunchback of Notre Dame ' . Mara is beautiful , talented , but a bit emotionally blurred , having left her fiancé in Spain just before their wedding . While her return is strained at first ( she is forced to break in to her own home because her mother forgot she was arriving ! ) , her mother Elvira ( María Rosa Fugazot ) and friends are happy she has returned after an 8-year absence . Mara is eager to see her childhood friend Joaquín who lives nearby , but there is a strange ambiance about his household : Joaquín has not left his room for two years , living in near silence in the dark , an obviously damaged young man . His father Ignacio ( Juan Leyrado ) is compassionate but feels Joaquín should be admitted to a psychiatric clinic . Joaquín pleads to stay at home and Ignacio agrees as long as his therapist doctor Balbis ( Jorge Marrale ) visits him daily . When Mara first sees Joaquín she is visibly disturbed , senses his problems , and begins to urge him out of his self-confinement . Slowly the two friends reveal each other's etiologies for maladjustment to life : Joaquín never recovered being abandoned first by his ill mother and second by Mara's abrupt leaving Argentina for her career , and Mara still is wounded by being abandoned by her father as a child and her failure to form lasting bonds with men . By opening memories and ultimately places outside Joaquín's house where they shared the intense bonding of their childhood each begins to heal : Mara has a successful evening as the star of her musical and regains her wounded self respect and Joaquín ( with the incredibly fine help of therapist Balbis ) shows he is shedding his pain of abandonment and growing toward a normal existence - these two factors set the stage for the film's conclusion . Director Daniel Barone takes this fragile tale and molds it into one of the more tender and touching films about the impact of childhood's ' tragedies ' that has been stated to date . The cinematography by Guillermo Zappino never forgets for a moment the dark tones underlying the lives of each of the characters . But the film would never have been so exacting and splendid were it not for the powerful performances by Adrián Suar and the extraordinarily beautiful and gifted Leticia Brédice ( ' Nine Queens ' , ' Burnt Money ' , ' Ashes from Paradise ' etc ) . The supporting cast is equally and homogeneously outstanding . This is one of those films that lingers in the mind , seeking stimuli for remembering our own demons of childhood , long after the credits are over . In Spanish with English subtitles , 110 minutes . Very Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
512858	3223254	464049	10.0	A Brilliant Play Transforms Magically into a Brilliant Film	Anyone who can watch the rolling credits at the end of THE HISTORY BOYS without tearful eyes simply hasn't been paying attention to this intelligent , richly comic , philosophical and tender tale of eight boys ostensibly preparing for exams but also preparing for life . The writing by Alan Bennett closely adapted from his prize winning play that was on the boards of theaters around the globe before being captured for posterity on film is ' rich and strange ' and so full of those values of achieving a true education that it serves not only the audience well but presents a gold standard for educators pondering how to transform their pupils into thinking , creative members of society . Very briefly , THE HISTORY BOYS are eight brilliant but ' crass ' young men in Cutler's Grammar School , each coming from backgrounds not considered ' quality ' by the British class standards . These boys are rowdy but committed to gaining admission to Oxford - a step toward erasing their class standing and proving their worth . The headmaster ( Clive Merrison ) , himself not too well educated , is bound to get these eight bright boys into the best schools and in that light he hires a new teacher Irwin ( Stephen Campbell Moore ) to buff the boys into a classy group who will be able to pass their essays and oral examinations . The existing teachers are the testy , frank Mrs . Lintott ( a fine Frances de la Tour ) and the massively obese Hector ( Richard Griffiths in a stunning performance ) who teaches ' general studies ' , a time when he lovingly coaxes the boys to embrace poetry , music , sentimentality , drama , art , and in general everything that allows them to take the moment and live it fully . The boys are torn between Irwin's pragmatic ' teach them how to take exams ' approach Hector's teach them how to embrace intelligence and life . Hector is known among the boys for fondling and the knowledge is accepted by the lads until Hector is seen fondling one of the boys on his motorbike and reported . This opens all manner of avenues of introspection , one of the boys confides to Irwin that he is homosexual , another of the lads declares that Irwin is gay and attempts a physical liaison with him , and the permutations move an down the line . But the exams come and the joy of accomplishing goals puts a different twist on matters and the ending is a touching as any on film . The entire cast is the original group that started the play and in addition to the fine performances by the adults , the boys are extraordinarily fine : Dominic Cooper ( Dakin ) , Jamie Parker ( Scripps ) , Samuel Barnett ( Posner ) , James Corden ( Timms ) , Sacha Dhawan ( Akhtar ) , Samuel Anderson ( Crowther ) , Russell Tovey ( Rudge ) , and Andrew Knott ( Lockwood ) . There is an obvious camaraderie among the actors that obviously grew from their long association with the roles . But the most impressive performance is the polished veteran actor Richard Griffiths who has created a role that will long remain in everyone's heart long after the movie has passed playing . For this viewer this is one of the very finest films of the past year ! Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
513246	3223254	388789	10.0	Art is the Common Denominator	BORN INTO BROTHELS won the Academy Award for documentaries : it should have also won the Humanitarian Award . Zana Briski and Ross Kauffman have not only created a captivating film about the plight and survival instincts of a group of eight children who were born to prostitutes in the red light district of Calcutta : they have given us a visual montage of the images captured by these children , through the cameras as lovingly instructed by Briski , that look back at the environment in which they are living . Without being the least bit preachy , Briski and Kauffman entered the infamous red light district , moved in so as not to seem voyeurs , and while Briski continued her long and successful portfolio of the women who ply their wares as the only means to overcome poverty , they discovered that the children of the prostitutes were curious , bright , and desirous of learning the magic the camera can produce . We meet each of the eight children ( three boys and five girls ) , learn the background and outlook of each and then watch as they embrace photography . Their photographs are so fine and their futures so grim that Briski and Kauffman pledge themselves to find paths of escape from their doomed state . Briski works to place them in boarding schools and enters their photographs in an international Press Group exhibition in Amsterdam . The children have such pride and personal growth that they are thrilled when on boy is selected to represent them at the exhibition in Amsterdam . Briski also arranges for exhibitions of the photographs , both internationally and locally so that all of the children can view their art in a respected place . Yet after elevating the future outlook of these eight children we see that only a few continue to have bright futures : the shame of their social caste and the mark of their ' criminal ' parents is stamped on them forever . Some escape , others join the line . The photography is splendid , rich in color and subject matter , and the video camera following Briski through the squalid red light district , pausing to hear abusive mothers and drugged fathers deny their children passage into a better life , hearing the wisdom of the elders who desire something more for these children , captures a world few know . Devoted as Briski and Kauffman are to their dream , they remain realistic and document an element of life in a third world country that is illuminating . This is a touching film without being maudlin , beautiful without ignoring reality . In English and with subtitles for the children's commentary . Highly Recommended for all viewers . Grady Harp
512826	3223254	440963	10.0	A Breathless , Intelligent , Finely Honed Part 3 of the Bourne Series	Paul Greengrass has stepped into the director's shoes for this third installment of the Jason Bourne identity crisis and in doing so has created nearly two hours of tension that would make Robert Ludlum proud ! This is an example of how Hollywood can shine when it integrates all of the components of an ' action suspense thriller ' by capitalizing on finding the best contributors available - actors , producers , cameramen , stunt men , script ( Tony Gilroy , George Nolfi and Scott Z . Burns ) , composer of music ( John Powell ) , editors - everyone of the hundreds required to pull off this superlative film . It is as fine as any thriller can be and reflects the intensity of concentration and understatement and respect for the viewers ' intellect that crowned his excellent UNITED 93 and THE BOURNE SUPREMACY . The result is a polished movie that remains compelling form the opening frame to the final credits . For those who have read or watched Ludlum's Bourne trilogy the story line is at core very simple : Jason Bourne has lost his memory and struggles through terrifying confrontations with all governments and potential assassins , endures relentless chases , and defies the machinations of the world's intelligence sources to discover his true identity . The rest of the novels and films are the how . Matt Damon has come into his own as an electrifying screen presence as Jason Bourne : his acting is keen and his ability to hold our concern through impossible situations would be difficult to duplicate by other actors of this genre . The supporting cast includes such superb actors as Joan Allen , David Strathairn , Scott Glenn , Albert Finney , Paddy Considine , Daniel Brühl , Joey Ansah and a very large cast of others . The pacing and use of Intelligence techniques is extraordinary and is beautifully captured by the cinematography of DP Oliver Wood and finessed by the editing of Christopher Rouse . One aspect of this film that is the most frightening is to observe just how invasive the Intelligence portions of our government can be : there seemingly are no secrets about even the most personal aspects of our lives that cannot be flashed on multiscreens in the war room of the CIA and associated organizations . Perhaps this film will be a red flag to alert public attention as to how our right to privacy has been so visibly raped by the government in the name of security - a factor that makes watching this excellent movie even more terrifying !

513588	3223254	326208	10.0	" If you're a white guy , you can get away with anything "	So speaks Andre Stander the day after a massive riot in Johannesburg South Africa in which Stander as a police captain finds himself killing a Zulu man in a morally shattering encounter . This utter disillusionment with the police force and their responses to the Apartheid situation makes Stander withdraw emotionally and physically from the Riot Squad and eventually his challenge that the blacks are unduly mistreated leads him to break the white laws by initiating a string of bank robberies - not for money but for a bizarre sort of revenge . Stander ( Tom Jane ) is good at what he does , both as a cop and as a criminal , but his clever bank heists eventually result in his being jailed where he finds two partners ( David O'Hara and Dexter Fletcher ) to join him in escape and in one of the longest bank robbery sprees in the history of South Africa . Stander remains conflicted : he loves his new wife Bekkie ( Deborah Kara Unger ) , he knows what he is doing is wrong , but the money is often shared with the blacks of Johannesburg , and he is driven to leave South Africa to eventually locate in Lauderdale , Florida . The eventual results of this man's career bring this film to a close in an action packed yet very soulful way . The film , as written by Bima Stagg and directed by Bronwen Hughes captures the atmosphere of the era in South Africa , and gives us a realistic look at the plight of the Africans in the Apartheid , offering insights to both sides of the conflict like few others have in film . He coaxes fine performances from his large cast of actors and extras , making this film less an action thriller than a character study of the enigmatic Andre Stander . The true star of this film , a film that deserves far more attention than it has been given , is Tom Jane . Jane is a strong actor , able to take on language accents with the best of them , and able to make us understand the spectrum of personality in this fascinating character . There are many scenes in which he plays in full nudity , quite apropos to the story , but just an indication of his commitment to ' fleshing out ' of his role . He is an actor to watch , an actor unafraid of tough roles in contrast to the showy Hollywood star parts . Grady Harp
513384	3223254	300270	10.0	Lucrecia Martel : An Argentinean Filmmaker in the Vein of Buñuel and Almodóvar	Lucrecia Martel is one gifted artist . Her latest film , ' La Niña santa ' ( The Holy Girl ) was conceived , written and directed in a style that is a tough and puzzling of Luis Buñuel and Pedro Almodóvar : what you see on the screen is an enigmatic mixture of sexuality and spirituality , comedy and drama , polemics and parody , all woven together in a fascinatingly beautiful story that demands a lot from the audience . Martel is a talent of enormous potential and magnitude . In a somewhat seedy hotel somewhere in Argentina ( ? Buenos Aires , ? Rosario ) lives divorced party planner Helena ( a brilliant Mercedes Morán ) , her also divorced brother Freddy ( Alejandro Urdapilleta ) , and her teenage daughter Amalia ( María Alche ) . Amalia goes to parochial school with her friend Josefina ( Julieta Zylberberg ) and there they study Catholic life and the need for a ' vocation ' . Both girls are caught up in the throes of adolescent sexual awakening and committed spiritual development , with the loggerheads the two themes can produce . Josefina is having safe sex ( ie anal sex ) while demanding that her perpetrator not speak during the act . Amalia finds a different encounter . In the hotel is a convention of doctors , among them one Dr . Jano ( Carlos Belloso ) who , though married with children , has a secretive act of pressing himself against the buttocks of young girls ( an act of molestation ) , and while listening to a street Thermin player , he rubs against Amalia . Amalia becomes obsessed with the act and its possible permutations and finally decides that this man's redemption is her ' vocation ' . While she confides the incidents to Josefina , she otherwise keeps her secret . Meanwhile Helena is monitoring the doctors ' convention and meets Dr Jano , is attracted to him , and agrees to be an ' actress ' for a convention closing drama on doctor / patient relationships . Dr Jano is invited to Helena's room where of course he meets the stalking Amalia , and the tension of the multiple innuendos mounts . Dr Jano's family arrives at the convention dousing Helena's hopes for a assignation , but encouraging Amalia to corner Jano to reassure him he is a good man ( ie , she provides his redemption - her ' vocation ' commitment for her spiritual training ) . How this plays out in the end provides the food for post-film thought and is best left for the viewer to see . Martel's technique for drawing characters is unique and extraordinary , made all the stronger from her carefully selected cast of top-flight actors ( many of whom she has used in prior projects , ' La Cienega ' etc ) . Her camera designs ( fulfilled by cinematographer Félix Monti ) and her wondrous emphasis on sound ( including original music by Andres Gerzenson as well as repeated use of Thermin reproduction of music by Bach and Bizet ) give her film a special look that is becoming her trademark . Her executive producer is Pedro Almodóvar which should tell the audience a lot about the importance of this film . Lucrecia Martel creates difficult , highly intelligent , at times meandering , but always fascinating movies . She is a budding giant in the industry . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
512898	3223254	404032	10.0	Possibilities : The Struggle Between Science and Faith	The timing of this film could not be more propitious as the courts struggle with Darwinism , Creationism , and separation of church and state , creating embittered conversations about fact versus faith . The fact that this film adaptation of an actual event results in a work of such touching tenderness is due to the imagination and artistry of writer Paul Harris Boardman and co-writer and director Scott Derrickson , as well as a fine cast of some of our best actors . This is not a horror flick : this is a thinking person's film that has the courage to discuss the possibilities of things on one can explain . Father Moore ( a brilliant Tom Wilkinson ) is a priest being tried for negligent homicide in the death of a young college student Emily Rose ( Jennifer Carpenter ) , a parishioner who sought his help feeling she was possessed by demons . The archdiocese hires pragmatic , agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner ( Laura Linney in another superlative role ) to defend Father Moore . The prosecuting attorney is strongly religious Methodist Ethan Thomas ( Campbell Scott in an atypical role well realized ) . The film is basically a courtroom drama : the polar sides being scientific ( medical ) facts versus spiritually based possibilities and the writing for both lawyers is bitingly incisive . Mixed into the testimony and preparation for the trial are flashbacks to the events leading up to Emily's death , including the gradual possession of Emily's body by six demons and her reaction to the possession , and the exorcism performed by Father Moore . The priest does not fear jail or loss of clerical collar : his only concern is that he be able to tell Emily's shared story , a story that raises more questions in everybody's minds than providing legal results of the trial . Laura Linney is extraordinary as the agnostic hardened lawyer whose very being is shaken by the case which she tries . The nuances of her character are so well conveyed that we come to understand the un-understandable as she sees it . Likewise Tom Wilkinson and Campbell Scott shine , as do all of the minor characters . The cinematography of Tom Stern is among the most artful of the year and the musical score by Christopher Young is intensely atmospheric . This is not yet another in the endless line of horror flicks , though the Para scientific manifestations of demon possession are graphically enacted ( not my cup of tea but necessary for the story ) . This is a much more important story than that and one that would be helpful in aiding understanding if both agnostics / pragmatists and spiritual people watched and listened . Grady Harp
513364	3223254	339419	10.0	A Quietly Brilliant Little Film About Coping and Other Atrocities of Living	Michael Burke both wrote and directed this first class , finely wrought exploration of coming of age in the emotional battlefield of rural bigotry . Rarely has so much been said so successfully with so little dialogue . Burke is clearly a gifted filmmaker about whom we should be hearing much ! The film opens with what appears to be an idyllic country road over which a person on an old bicycle is delivering eggs . As the credits are ending we see the person on the bicycle walk up a steep incline then fall to the ground . As the actual film opens we discover that this person was the mother of Duncan ( Emile Hirsch in a career making performance ) , a fourteen year old young lad who is left mourning with his distant father Edgar ( Richard Jenkins ) . Unable to wholly cope with the loss of his mother , Duncan holds closely to her remnants - a chicken as a pet who his mother taught him could be calmed by putting the chicken's head in Duncan's mouth , an old fake fur coat he wears to bed , and some kitchen skills he learned at her side . Edgar is resentful that Duncan isn't more helpful on their small farm and is shaken by observing Duncan's means of mourning his mother . Duncan is a loner , hungry for relating , and encounters neighboring Perry ( Tom Guiry , in another gripping performance ) , a seemingly macho kid who apparently is beaten ( if not more ) by his low-class father . The two bond , slowly , out of mutual needs . Perry defends Duncan's ridiculing by the local rowdy kids and even encourages Duncan to join the drinking bouts with the group . Yet Duncan remains an outsider , longing to be included , and when certain events occur with Perry ( Perry urges Duncan to put on his mother's wedding dress in the secrecy of the barn and then progresses to having Duncan perform sexual acts with him , declaring all the while that he , Perry , is not gay . . . ) only to have the incident be partially discovered by Duncan's father . At odds with what to do with his strange acting son , Edgar forces Duncan to work at meaningless jobs on the farm , help with the haying , and makes Duncan observe the burning of the mother's clothes and belongings . Duncan seeks Perry's consolation after the above events and despite Perry's homophobic comments , Duncan manages to gain the kiss from Perry that he so desires as a resurrection of affection desperately missing in his life . Perry is further abused by his own father and participates to a degree in an incident of harassment by the local rowdies of Duncan and his pet chicken . It is the method in which this final confrontation ends that speaks so strongly about Duncan's needs and Perry's buried feelings . After the confrontation Duncan rides his bicycle home to where his father finally perceives the agony chewing Duncan's soul and the movie ends in one of the most life affirming moments ever captured on film . The photography is magnificent , the musical score is spare and enhancing , and the acting on the part of every member of this well directed cast is superb . This is a film that deserves wide audience exposure , and especially for those young people who are struggling with their sexuality in the ugly isolation surrounding the lives of the main characters of this excellent film .

512844	3223254	443543	10.0	A Well-Crafted , Well-Acted Atmospheric La Belle Epoque Viennese Mystery	Steven Millhauser's brilliant little short story ' Eisenheim the Illusionist ' is beautifully realized cinematically by Neil Burger who not only adapted the story as a screenplay but also directed with a great flair for the subject . Wisely using the repeated line ' Nothing is what it seems ' Burger infuses this dark investigation into the lives of the divided Viennese classes and suggests the crumbling of the Austro-Hungarian Empire with the focus on the illusory magic of one Eisenheim ( finely characterized by Edward Norton ) and its effects on the Crown Prince Leopold ( Rufus Sewell ) and the bifurcated Duchess Sophie ( Jessica Biel ) . As children Eisenheim and Sophie were friends despite the disparity of their class : Sophie was royalty ( a Duchess ) and Eisenheim was the son of a cabinetmaker to the court . They fall in love but are separated by caste and Eisenheim wanders Asia and Russia learning the vagaries of magic and illusionist tricks while Sophie is raised at court to become the wife of Crown Prince Leopold , whose plans to overthrow his father the Emperor to become the King of both Austria and Hungary have made him an obsessive scoundrel . Years later Eisenheim enters Vienna as a showman , under the tutelage of his impresario Josef Fischer ( Eddie Marsan ) , delighting audiences with his illusionist tricks . His impossible love for Sophie resurfaces and he becomes suspect in his role as an illusionist and as a threat tot he Crown . Eisenheim is investigated carefully by Chief Police Inspector Uhl ( a brilliant role by Paul Giamatti ) and the manner in which the fates of the Crown versus the love of Eisenheim and Sophie are resolved is , well , ' Nothing is what it seems ' . The cast is outstanding , the setting ( in Prague ) is incredibly atmospheric , and the costuming and lighting and cinematography marry into a perfect fit . Adding to the illusionist spirit of the film is the fine musical score by Phillip Glass so well loved for his score for ' The Hours ' and one of our most important classical music composers of the day . THE ILLUSIONIST is a fine , misty , dark evocation of life in La Belle Époque of Vienna , based enough on fact that the fiction employs the concept that nothing is what it seems . Grady Harp
513082	3223254	430576	10.0	Silence as a Protection for Facing Past Horrors	It is always a joy to find a DVD in the videostore that is completely an unknown entity , only to discover upon viewing it that it is a little masterpiece of cinematic art . Such is the case with THE SECRET LIFE OF WORDS , and having seen the film now raises the question of how it went unnoticed in the theater release . Though touted on the cover as an ' Almodóvar film ' , in reality it's connection to the genius lies in the fact that both Pedro and his brother Agustín Almodóvar were executive producers : the film was written and directed by Spanish artist Isabel Coixet ( Paris , je t'aime , Invisibles , My Life Without Me ) . It is a minimalist statement about the indomitable human spirit , a story that slowly unwinds to reveal some of the most terrifying aspects of trauma of war and guilt and shame ever written . Hanna ( Sarah Polley , in a phenomenal performance ) is a deaf , silent reclusive young woman working as a line operator in a factory , so married to her meaningless job that her boss insists she take a vacation she deserves . Hanna does as she's told , and journeys to a seaside spot where she hears about a man on an oil rig in the middle of the ocean who is severely burned and needs a nurse . Hanna quietly takes the job , is flown by the doctor ( Steven Mackintosh ) to the isolated oil rig , populated with only a few men - cook Simon ( Javier Cámara of ' Hable con ella ' , ' La Mala educación , ' Lucía y el sexo ' etc ) , oceanographer and workers ( Eddie Marsan , Daniel Mays , Dean Lennox Kelly , Danny Cunningham , Emmanuel Idowu ) and a captain ( Steven Mackintosh ) , and meets her patient Josef ( Tim Robbins ) who is temporarily blinded from burns to his corneas , and severely burned on his limbs . Josef seeks to discover information from Hanna , but Hanna shares nothing about herself , spending her time dressing Josef's wounds , feeding him and tending to his needs . He slowly reveals his painful past to her ( he was burned in an accident in which his best friend was burned to death , the friend whose wife had become Josef's lover ! ) . Hanna is treated well by the few men on the isolated rig and learns to eat the exotic foods prepared by Simon , becoming friends with the crew , though at a distance , and gradually Hanna speaks with Josef about herself . In a painful confessional Hanna reveals that she is Bosnian and a survivor of the Balkan war , a hideous time when she and her close friend were captured , tortured and raped , leaving Hanna with physical as well as psychic scars and an enormous feeling of shame that her friend died and she survived . This knowledge bonds Hanna and Josef , but by this point it is time for Josef to be medevaced to a hospital onshore and the two part company . After some time has passed and Josef has recovered , he begins his search for Hanna and the journey and its finale serve as a touching end to the story . The cast is uniformly brilliant , including a small role of Hanna's therapist played convincingly by Julie Christie . The metaphors the tale offers are many , but the most moving is an examination of how the human mind deals with survival and shame after trauma . Director Isabel Coixet draws such subtle performances from the entire cast in this very small film , proving she is one of the more important artists in film making today . Very Highly Recommended .

512981	3223254	119626	10.0	Ensemble Film-making at its Finest	Adolfo Aristarain is one of those rare filmmakers who defines his own world in cinema by writing and directing terrific stories with brilliant dialogue and using a familiar cadre of actors who give the finished product an ensemble effort . He is one of Argentina's finest artists and couples frequently with writer Kathy Saavedra ( Roma , Un lugar en el mundo , Lugares communes , Martín ( Hache ) , etc ) and elects to use the extraordinary actors from Argentina such as Federico Luppi . Cecilia Roth , Juan Diego Botta and Eusebio Poncela . The results are stunning motion pictures that while addressing the intellect of the audience never fail to entertain as well . ' Martín ( Hache ) ' is just such a film . With a challenging and wise script and a cadre of fine actors in every role Aristarain has created a poignant , philosophical and superlative character study about people and their need for relating in the world as we have altered it today . Martín ( the brilliant Federico Luppi ) is a wealthy writer who left his family in Buenos Aires five years ago to live and work in Madrid . He has a nineteen year old son Hache ( Juan Diego Botta ) - Hache is the Spanish pronunciation for the alphabet letter ' J ' and since the son's name is Martin J . he elects to be called J or Hache - who is a restless , foundationless teenager who refuses to go to school preferring to simply play his electric guitar and run with the drug crowd . His mother has remarried and has a new baby and Hache is feeling like a third wheel . He accidentally overdoses on alcohol and drugs during a performance , collapses , and his mother notifies Martín that Hache has attempted suicide to induce Martín to return to Buenos Aires and take back his son Hache . Hache of course recovers and his mother insists that Hache is in the way and that he must go to Madrid to live with Martín : Martín begrudgingly agrees . In Madrid , Martín has been living the life of a recluse whose only contacts are his squeeze Alicia ( Cecilia Roth , an actress of limitless talent ) , who escapes her life by an addiction to coke but loves Martín , and his best friend the bisexual actor Dante ( Eusebio Poncela ) who is an Epicurean living all aspects of life for the pleasures he finds . Once Hache has moved in with his distant , cold , sullen father he falls under the influence of Alicia and Dante who adore him and attempt to show him a life of sunshine in Madrid while Martín sequesters himself in his writing . How this unlikely quartet interacts , bouncing the Apollonian against the Dionysian poles of living forms the basis for the story . Hache grows to understand the spectrum of worldviews , a tragedy occurs , and the ongoing silent duel between the father and the son comes to a touching resolution . Hearing and watching this quartet of brilliant actors is not unlike attending a performance of a fine string quartet . Aristarain keeps the long film ( two hours + ) moving in such a beautifully liquid flow that the story seems to take moments . But the moments are all treasures , the result of the ensemble of writing , directing , and acting . ' Martín ( Hache ) ' is simply a brilliant film . In Spanish with English subtitles . Grady Harp
512977	3223254	364120	10.0	Human Sexuality and the Spectrum of Love	Sébastien Lifshitz ( ' Come Undone ' , ' The Crossing ' ) is one of the more sensitive directors to arrive on the scene in some time . He molds stories about the periphery of mankind and creates deeply human dramas without the clutter and noise that often dampen the effect of intense emotional experiences . He is intelligent , a fine writer and observer and a man unafraid to take chances : all but two of the actors in WILD SIDE are amateurs with no experience in front of the camera and from these neophytes he extracts brilliant performances . He is an artist to watch . Stéphanie ( Stéphanie Michelini ) is a transsexual who makes her living through prostitution on the streets of Paris . She is a gentle , soft-spoken , tender person who is making her way in life as the being she has selected to present . She meets Djamel ( Yasmine Belmadi ) a handsome bisexual North African young man who likewise makes his living turning tricks in the subways and streets of Paris , another person estranged from his family as is Stéphanie . Yet another young man Mikhail ( Edouard Nikitine ) estranged from his family in Russia meets Stéphanie and falls in love with her . The three outsiders from a true ménage a trois , all three genetically males , all three in need of love and belonging and capable of sharing love equally within the trio . When Stéphanie learns her estranged mother ( Josiane Stoléru ) is critically ill , she travels to her rural French neighborhood of her youth together with Mikhail and Djamel and it is this confrontation with her past and the way she pieces her life together with the love of Mikhail and Djamel that creates the beauty of this film . Though there are innumerable reasons for recommending this film the main one remains the manner in which Lifshitz has taken a script written with his long-term associate and fellow professor at La Fémis ( Paris ) Stéphane Bouquet about a marginalized portion of society and crafted one of the more touching love stories that needs and receives no apologies . Stéphanie ( the actress is a transsexual in real life and has never acted before ) is presented not as an oddity but as just a human being for whom life has dealt some challenges . We see her in the opening scenes fully nude with the lovely body of a female that happens to also have male genitalia . The isolation of Stéphanie's life is shown from the beginning in a scene where a group of transsexuals listen tearfully as a singer ( Antony Hegarty ) sings a tender ballad ' I fell in love with a beautiful dead boy . . . but was he a girl or a boy ? ' . This quiet manner pervades the film . Mikhail is likewise played by an unknown inexperienced actor and plumbs the depths of his lonely Russian émigré with gently nuanced humility . Djamel and Stephanie's mother are played by actors with whom Lifshitz has worked before and their superlative work helps coax the best performances from the neophytes . The breathtaking cinematography is by Agnès Godard , a genius for creating atmosphere and mood , equally successful in the cramped environs where the sex for money acts are performed as well as in the beauty of the Parisian streets and the French rural countryside . The subtle music score by Jocelyn Pook is variations by a string quartet and harp and very well composed . The DVD gratefully includes and interview with Lifshitz and for once the information shared is extremely beneficial to the enjoyment of the film . Because audiences in general have difficulty with trans / homosexual love scenes this film will probably never receive the recognition it deserves . But for those who long for the power of truly fine independent films , this film is as fine as they come - in story , in direction , in acting , in cinematography and , most important , in honesty . It is a jewel of a movie . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
512686	3223254	407936	10.0	A Triumph on Every Level !	LACKAWANNA BLUES is a fine stage play by Ruben Santiago-Hudson and an even finer film as the author adapted his own life story for the screen . This brilliant film ignites the screen with rich colors , fine music , brilliant editing , superb direction by George C . Wolfe , and a cast so stunning that they make an encore viewing compulsory ! Yes , it is just that good . The story is based on the author's life as the child ' Junior ' ( Marcus Carl Franklin ) raised in the inimitable home of soulfully empathetic Rachel " Nanny " Crosby ( S . Epatha Merkerson ) , a lady who devoted her life to aiding the disenfranchised by transporting them from the South , from mental hospitals , and from the streets to Lackawanna , New York . The boy recalls all the lessons he learned about life from the inhabitants of the house - odd characters with painful pasts - and from the disintegration of his racially mixed biological family rescued by Nanny . The myriad characters of the home are too numerous to outline but they are portrayed by some of the finest actors in the business : Terrence Howard , Rosie Perez , Mos Def , the beautiful Carmen Ejogo , Louis Gossett Jr . , Jeffrey Wright , Ernie Hudson , Charlayne Woodward , Jimmy Smits , Patricia Wettig , Macy Gray , Liev Schreiber , Kathleen Chalfant , Lou Myers , Hill Harper - the list goes on and on . In the course of the film we are introduced to the cruelties of racism , the history of desegregation , the dynamics of drug abuse and violence , the infectious joy of African American music contributions to our musical culture , and the courage of one fine woman who battled all the hardships the world can dish out to maintain the dignity of those with whom she came into contact . S . Epatha Merkerson is wholly submerged in this role , a role she makes shine like a beacon of reason in a world of chaos . She offers one of the most stunning performances of the past years , and had this film been released in the theaters instead of as an HBO movie , she without a doubt would add the Oscar to place along side her Golden Globe award . The entire cast is exceptional and Wolfe handles the acting and the story like a master : like riffs in a jazz piece , he pastes tiny moments of conversation with each character and Junior along with flashes of scenes from the story with the matrix of dance fests at the local clubs brimming over the top with incredible blues , jazz , dancing , and joy . The production crew has mounted this little miracle of a picture with extreme care and never for a moment does attention lag from the momentum of the story . Highly Recommended , almost Compulsory Viewing ! Grady Harp
513064	3223254	352994	10.0	Certainly One of the Finest Films of the Year !	Eytan Fox ( ' Yossi & Jagger ' , and others ) is an important director to watch . Born in the USA and emigrated to Israel at the age of two , Fox understands the art of cinematic storytelling and in WALK ON WATER he brings this impressive tale of universal and personal forgiveness written by Gal Uchovsky with collaboration by actors Knut Berger and Caroline Peters , and Andreas Struck to the screen with finesse , subtlety , and grace . His in a name to watch . Films dealing with the aftermath of Hitler's annihilation of the Jews and their subsequent formation of the haven Israel have been many and variably successful , primarily because the Jew vs Nazi histories have been so polarized to appeal to all audiences who need to have good guys vs bad guys easily identified for them . This beautiful film refuses to go there , but instead mixes the young people of Germany and Israel in a manner that finally enlightens us as to the process of letting go , of forgiveness in order to move ahead with living . Eyal ( the dashingly handsome and sensitive actor Lior Ashkenazi ) works for the Israeli group headed by Menachem ( Gideon Shemer ) whose life's work it is to track down and kill all remaining Nazi perpetrators of the concentration camps . Eyal is a damaged man , his wife has committed suicide partially because of his job as hired assassin of anti-Israeli people , and he has finally grown weary of Menachem's obsession to exterminate all living Nazis . Yet he is assigned one more ' victim ' , an old man who is the grandfather of two German young people - Pia ( Caroline Peters ) who happily lives in an Israeli kibbutz and her brother Axel ( Knut Berger ) who has come to Israel to plead with his sister to return to Berlin to her estranged parents for her father's birthday . Pia knows of her grandfather's Nazi war crimes and resents that her parents had helped him escape from being tried as a war criminal . Menachem assigns Eyal to be Axel's ' tour guide ' in Israel , hoping to find a path to their grandfather , the war criminal . Axel is gay and during his time with Eyal touring the sites of Israel the two grow warmly as friends , Eyal asking many penetrating questions about Axel's gay lifestyle . Pia , Axel and Eyal become friends and when Pia refuses to join Axel in returning to Berlin for the father's birthday , Eyal ' consents ' to accompany him . Several incidents occur both in Israel and Berlin that bond Eyal and Axel and that unveil some of Eyal's shaky demons of Arab hate , homophobia , and guilt over his wife's suicide . Yet for the first time Eyal has a man with whom he can relate and he grows fond of Axel . In Berlin Eyal is warmly accepted into Axel's vast home . At the birthday party Axel displays his love for Israeli folk dancing as a gift to his father , engendering kind feelings from Eyal . But suddenly the grandfather is wheeled into the room by his attending nurse , repulsing Axel , and Eyal leaves : Meachem has followed him to Berlin and tells Eyal to terminate the old man . Eyal returns to the house and is unable to carryout his task , and the resulting resolution of the ' deed ' and the manner in which Eyal and Axel come together is one of those magic moments of storytelling , one that equates with the miraculous ability to walk on water . The cast is superb , always allowing us to see the hidden corners of intent , motivation , and lasting resentment as well as the opening of the doors of ultimate forgiveness and life . WALK ON WATER is a thriller , an espionage film , an historic moment , and a love story told with richly detailed sensitivity and bravura . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
513131	3223254	411195	10.0	An Odyssey of a Visual and Emotional Feast !	BREAKFAST ON PLUTO is now on DVD and perhaps that will garner the larger audience it deserves after its scant art house run on the big screen . In every way this is a tender , sensitive , sweet story , full of hope , faith , indefatigable courage and persistence that is embellished by a first class performance by the gifted Cillian Murphy . Ireland , late 50s early 60s , and a child is left abandoned on the doorstep of the local priest ( Liam Neeson ) . The priest hurriedly places the infant with a foster mother and we watch the little boy Patrick Braden slowly grow into a cross-dressing child with outsider friends , loathed by his adopted mother to the point where he is unable to cope with life as a lie and makes off to London as a transvestite gay man ( now going by the name ' Kitten Braden ' ) . He hopes to find his birth mother and his search leads him through the dregs of London , the city that ' swallowed up ' his real mother , becoming involved with the seamier side of the city , jailed mistakenly , becoming an apprentice to a magician ( Stephen Rea ) , a cabaret singer , etc until he finally makes the discovery of his beginnings - his true parents - and his journey to find happiness ends sweetly . The entire cast of this long ( over two hours ) film is so fine that never for an instant does the pace of the tale let up . The cinematography by Declan Quinn is splendid , the costumes by Eimer Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh are some of the best recreations of the 70's on film , and the musical score by Anna Jordan mixes her own creations with the wonderful tunes from the era and the result is brilliantly integrated into the film . Director Neil Jordan adapted the screenplay from Patrick McCabe's fine novel and finds all the magic and makes it visual . But in the long run if we are unable to identify and care about Patrick ' Kitten ' Braden the movie would seem silly . Cillian Murphy is such an honest actor ( having spent time pre-production living with transvestites about whom he speaks so tenderly in the featurette ) and gives a multifaceted , glitteringly fine performance . This is a fun , entertaining , and important film . Highly Recommended for all audiences ! Grady Harp
513123	3223254	176415	10.0	Love and Honor	EL ABUELO ( The Grandfather ) began as a 1954 novel by Benito Pérez Galdós and was adapted for the screen by writer / director José Luis Garci in 1998 , a year when it was nominated for Best Foreign Film Oscar . It is a period piece of epic proportions , an immensely beautiful work both visually and emotionally , that assures the film's becoming a beloved standard in the cinematic library . Don Rodrigo de Arista Potestad ( Fernando Fernán Gómez , the brilliant Peruvian actor from such films as ' Butterfly ' , ' Belle Epoque ' , ' All About My Mother , etc ) is a crusty old aristocrat who has been in America for the Gold Rush who returns to Spain ( a small town of Jerusa ) when his son dies . He concern is about a letter his son wrote to him that one of his two granddaughters was sired by another man , an artist , and the old man is determined to find out which one of the granddaughters should rightfully inherit is name and his money . He arrives to meet Dolly ( Cristina Cruz ) and Nelly ( Cristina Cruz ) and their beautiful mother Doña Lucrecia ( Cayetana Guillén Cuervo ) , a woman who has survived emotional hardships but has generously favored the small town with gifts while giving her daughters in home schooling by the intelligent , sensitive Don Pío Coronado ( Rafael Alonso ) who has been forsaken by his own family . The once butler of the home Senén Corchado ( Agustín González ) has been freed to become an oily capitalist , eager to squander the family money . Don Rodrigo ( Abuelo ) challenges the family to maintain the honor of his name , becomes fast friends with Don Pío , and the two set about to discover whether it is Dolly or Nelly that is the true bloodline granddaughter . The manner in which the investigation proceeds includes the warm relationship Abuelo forms with the girls , the way he decides the future of Lucrecia , and the bonding he forms with Pío . It is Pío who challenges Abuelo with the question of which is more important , honor or love , and it is this question that suffuses the resolution of the story with surprises and with extraordinary tenderness . The actors are all superb with special kudos to Fernando Fernán Gómez and Rafael Alonso . The cinematography of the coastlines of Spain is breathtakingly beautiful and the manner in which Raúl Pérez Cubero frames his images glows . The original musical score is by Manuel Balboa whose love theme is hauntingly played by both piano and orchestra : the moments of music by Satie ( Gymnopédie ) and Elgar ( the Nimrod variation from Enigma Variations ) are beautifully performed by the Madrid Orchestra under the baton of Ángel Gil Ordóñez . The film is long ( well over two hours ) and there are some synchrony defects in the spoken soundtrack ( ? dubbing for the granddaughters ' voices ? ) , but these are minor flaws in an eloquently beautiful film . In Spanish with English subtitles . Grady Harp
513695	3223254	292963	10.0	A Family Implosion	The full title of this film is ' May you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows you're dead ' , a rewording of the old Irish toast ' May you have food and raiment , a soft pillow for your head ; may you be 40 years in heaven , before the devil knows you're dead . ' First time screenwriter Kelly Masterson ( with some modifications by director Sidney Lumet ) has concocted a melodrama that explores just how fragmented a family can become when external forces drive the members to unthinkable extremes . In this film the viewer is allowed to witness the gradual but nearly complete implosion of a family by a much used but , here , very sensible manipulation of the flashback / flash forward technique of storytelling . By repeatedly offering the differing vantages of each of the characters about the central incidents that drive this rather harrowing tale , we see all the motivations of the players in this case of a robbery gone very wrong . Andy Hanson ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) is a wealthy executive , married to an emotionally needy Gina ( Marisa Tomei ) , and addicted to an expensive drug habit . His life is beginning to crumble and he needs money . Andy's ne're-do well younger brother Hank ( Ethan Hawke ) is a life in ruins - he is divorced from his shrewish wife Martha ( Amy Ryan ) , is behind in alimony and child support , and has borrowed all he can from his friends , and he needs money . Andy proposes a low-key robbery of a small Mall mom-and-pop jewelry store that promises safe , quick cash for both . The glitch is that the jewelry story belongs to the men's parents - Charles ( Albert Finney ) and Nanette ( Rosemary Harris ) . Andy advances Hank some cash and wrangles an agreement that Hank will do the actual robbery , but though Hank agrees to the ' fail-safe ' plan , he hires a friend to take on the actual job while Hank plans to be the driver of the getaway car . The robbery is horribly botched when Nanette , filing in for the regular clerk , shoots the robber and is herself shot in the mess . The disaster unveils many secrets about the fragile relationships of the family and when Nanette dies , Charles and Andy and Hank ( and their respective partners ) are driven to disastrous ends with surprises at every turn . Each of the actors in this strong but emotionally acrid film gives superb performances , and while we have come to expect that from Hoffman , Hawke , Tomei , Finney , Ryan , and Harris , it is the wise hand of direction from Sidney Lumet that make this film so unforgettably powerful . It is not an easy film to watch , but it is a film that allows some bravura performances that demand our respect , a film that reminds us how fragile many families can be . Grady Harp
