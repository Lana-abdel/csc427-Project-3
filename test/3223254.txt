513027	3223254	371675	1.0	An Unfortunate Display of Opportunism	Anytime the urge rises to be entertained with an escapist film the top of the list becomes one of the Asian martial arts films , films of stunning beauty , breathtaking choreography , handsome actors , and enough legend to make the storyline fascinating , e . g . ' The House of Flying Daggers ' . This pathetic film is packaged like those wonder movies and so deludes the public into thinking it is in an equal category . Not even close ! A child is born to a couple informed that their progeny will be a male warrior who has the secrets to read the codebook that contains the key to the power of the universe . The pregnant mother is stabbed by the evil adversaries but the baby lives , ' disappointingly ' a girl ! The girl Seki is transported via a leaf boat to a blind wise magician who cares for her and teaches her Taiji and Kung Fu , raising her to return to the world and discover life along with her gifts . A family who wants to maintain dominion over China sends two sons ( one evil and the other kind ) to capture the girl and steal the code to the sacred book . The evil son is accompanied by warriors : the kind son is accompanied by Caucasian Marx brothers . The rest of the story is too simple-minded to discuss . There are so many errors of judgment in the making of this film , not the least of which is a nebulous and silly script , that disrupt what might have been an honest attempt for Hollywood to make a martial arts film . But the acting is poor , combining Asian actors with non-Asian actors makes both look ridiculous , the special effects are clumsy , and the mood of ancient China is completely destroyed by the computer generated graphics superimposed on the real location of Griffith Park in Los Angeles ! The three stooges added to the good warrior's team are so silly that they pass funny into absurd . There is no ending to the movie : instead it feels like the producers just ran out of money . A must miss .
512830	3223254	884328	2.0	A Movie with Many Problems	THE MIST has the full panorama of responses , from those who find it ' the best of the Stephen King story adaptations ' to those who find it a feeble attempt to wed science fiction with biblical predictions . Frank Darabont has successfully brought King's popular horror stories to the screen with great success . For this film his gathered a substantial cast , used computer generated graphics well , but in the end the result is a confusing mishmash of story versus sermon versus actors being overwhelmed by some really strange upstaging creatures . David Drayton ( Thomas Jane ) is a graphic artist who manages to weather a freak storm only to discover a mysterious mist hovering over his backyard lake . Going to town with his young son to get supplies at a Food Store he joins the other townsfolk in the gossip about the mist which now engulfs the town : could it be due to some experiment at the military post lab in the mountains ? The store's generator sounds like it is fumbling , and while brave David tries to fix it ( mind you , in this town with no electricity , the lights in the main store remain on . . . . ) , he sees the back wall buckling and hears a bizarre noise . Returning to the storefront , his findings are not believed - especially by the town psycho Mrs . Carmody ( Marcia Gay Harden ) who sees all things in relation to her channeling of God via her knowledge of the Book of Revelations , and the dubious out-of-towner Brent Norton ( Andre Braugher ) . But gradually David gathers some sensible folk ( Toby Jones , Chris Owen , et al ) to accompany him to the generator room and against David's warning , the back door is opened by the young stock boy and huge tentacles enter from the mist and consume the lad . Thus we have two factions : those who side with Mrs . Carmody's religious zealot need to sacrifice people to the outdoor monsters now flying about the store and those who are convinced they must fight the offenders with force and escape . The mess of a story is further confused with overlay of father / son devotion , mass hysteria , mob rule , revenge on the military for loosing these ' other world monsters ' on the public , and ' what do we do if this is the end of the earth ' . How it all winds down may satisfy some and may irritate others . So why rate this film with two stars instead of one ? Marcia Gay Harden gives a bravura performance as the crazy Mrs . Carmody and Toby Jones offers a solid representation of the stable man as a clerk in the store who keeps his wits about him . Thomas Jane is Thomas Jane , and for an action hero , he seems to melt with the circumstances . The movie is long , silly , not scary , and suffers from a weak script . For those who are entertained by this sort of story it may be worthwhile . For those who are fatigued by the same old line of good versus evil in the form of gooey huge monsters , pass on this film .

513025	3223254	460887	2.0	Pass on this Takeoff on Horror Films	Jason Paul Collum both wrote and directed this little film that resembles a gay ' Fatal Attraction ' without the benefit of a tight script , good actors , suspense , or sophisticated effects and camera work . Sadly it boils down to a fifteen-minute story spread out over an almost interminable 2 hours . The story involves on Corin ( Sean Michael Lambrecht ) , a 30-year old ad exec in a five-year bumpy relationship with 23-year old party boy Jake ( Jeff Dylan Graham ) . Corin's boss and friend Nancy ( Brinke Stevens ) understands Corin all too well , appreciates his relationship , but in attempting to relieve his work duties hires an assistant Elliot ( Jerod Howard ) , a gender confused nerdy lad who is engaged to his lifelong chum Marti ( Tina Ona Paukstelis ) in a push from his mother ( Judith O'Dea ) to make things ' right ' . Elliot is befriended by Corin , brought into Corin's and Jake's friendship , and Elliot and Marti and Corin and Jake begin socializing . Elliot falls for Corin , comes out of the closet to the extreme dismay of Marti and his mother , and despite Elliot's friendship with Corin and Jake , he begins to stalk Corin . Corin's rebuff of his advances leads to disaster and the film tumbles downhill from there . Yes , some may view this weak little foray as being full of statements about love , obsession , relationships , and friendships , but all of that has been said far better before and without the seemingly tacked on genre of a horror film . The acting from the women in the film is good , but the men are blunted stereotypes . Everything about the film screams low budget . One annoying factor - a music score that sounds like lessons on electronic keyboards and obscures a lot of the dialogue - turns out to be a blessing in that the weak script is covered frequently . Most viewers will utilize the fast forward button to get through the repetitious dialogue and race for the end , a predictable , stagy tableaux that really doesn't resolve anything . Not worth two hours of your viewing time .
513044	3223254	418819	2.0	Obviously there is an audience for this product . . . .	George A . Romero enters with yet another installment in his banal and grossly visual zombie flicks and hopefully this will be the last of them . Obviously there is an appreciative audience who enjoys watching partially decomposed bodies stomp around and grunt and eat body parts of the living because a lot of people write positively about this film . For this viewer the ' parody ' eludes . LAND OF THE DEAD is simply a dark , grotesque , poorly written , hastily thrown together bit of treacle to make money off the folks who like this genre . But how fine actors like Simon Baker , John Leguizamo , Dennis Hopper , Asia Argento , and Robert Joy agree to the casting agent's invitation to star in this film is a conundrum . Grady Harp
512652	3223254	465142	2.0	Perhaps if you like American Idol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	American DREAMZ is a pitiful mess of a movie , a film that seems as though it wants to be a satire on the Bush administration , on talk show hosts , and on our current state of mindless entertainment that seems to keep high ratings and low IQs neck and neck . The story , what little there is , involves a bored talent show host ( Hugh Grant , who looks very down in the tooth ) desperate to get out of his mindless role , and hungry for people who are over the edge to come on his popular show and make fools of themselves . He manages to accomplish this from some rather innocent folks as well as the President of the United States ( GWB imitator Dennis Quaid , Laura Bush imitator Marcia Gay Harden , and Cheney imitator Willem Dafoe ) . Along the way we meet some fragments of characters portrayed by some fine actors who bought into this venture belonging to Paul Weitz for some unknown reason : Mandy Moore , Jennifer Coolidge , a promising Sam Golzari , Chris Klein , Seth Meyers , and Shohreh Aghdashloo . Satire can be one of the finest forms of art , but it requires a very intelligent script . That missing element is what drives this very unfunny carcass into the dumpster ! Grady Harp
513265	3223254	808279	3.0	' Funny ' as in ' Strange ' , NOT as in ' Ha-Ha '	FUNNY GAMES is Michael Haneke's English language remake of his own German success from 1997 by the same name . While is takes some interesting twist and turns as far as technique of film-making goes , the story lies somewhere between repulsive and prolonged boring , and is not a film this viewer would watch again . We first meet Ann ( Naomi Watts ) , husband George ( Tim Roth ) , and son Georgie ( Devon Gearhart ) as they drive to their vacation spot playing games of guessing arias and opera singer identities from CDs in their car . But immediately on arriving to their lakeside home they are visited by a strange young lad Peter ( Brady Corbet ) who asks to borrow eggs for their next-door neighbor . Soon Peter's mishaps are magnified when his friend Paul ( Michael Pitt ) joins him in a rather preposterous game of arguing over trite situations that result in Peter and Paul ( malignantly sterile in appearance in white shorts and shirts and gloves ) moving into the ' funny games ' that are aimed at total destruction of Ann , George and Georgie . It is not funny , it is not credible , and yes , it does become annoying in the manner in which the writing for Ann and George makes them into fools for going along with the ' games ' as long as they do . Watts and Roth are wasted in this film but Pitt and Corbet manage performances that kick us in the gut - as these oily creatures are meant to do . Not a film to be recommended for general viewing , but one that will please those who love the torture genre . Grady Harp ,
512827	3223254	460435	3.0	Unsuccessful Attempt to Update Henry James ' Classic Novella	Hollywood is fond of updating classic tales : Shakespeare is the author most often reconfigured , at times with great success , at times not . The intellectually stimulating works of Henry James have been brought to the screen and making visual the inherently cerebral stories come to life . Such , sadly , is not the case for IN A DARK PLACE , a warping and distorted ' update ' of one of the finest ghost stories ever written - James ' 1898 TURN OF THE SCREW . Screenwriter Peter Waddington adapted the story to place in our faces fully realized interpretations of what James used as suggestion : James realized that the reader's mind could infuse his story with personal demons that would replace the need for detailed description . Cases in point : the Governess is here an art teacher given a name , Anna Veigh ; the occult sexual overtones of the story are played out in full view leaving little to the frightening aspects of James ' intentions ; the concentration of the story on the governess ' mental fragility is forced into clichés and placed in the hands of an actress unable to be subtle ; the ' interiority ' of the mansion is replaced by equal time outside on the snowy grounds ( opening up the story , so they say ) , etc . The story is well known , having been adapted successfully before by television , movies , and opera ( Benjamin Britten's immensely well written opera TURN OF THE SCREW ) . Anna Veigh ( Leelee Sobieski ) is the art therapist turned governess who upon losing her job is hired to care for the children Flora ( Gabrielle Adam ) and Miles ( Christian Olson ) in a now deserted mansion whose only other occupant is the secretary / estate manager Ms . Grose ( Tara Fitzgerald ) . Soon enough Anna discovers that the previous governess Miss Jessel ( another art therapist who was three months pregnant ) was found dead in the lake , and that the prior male butler Peter Quint hanged himself . Anna alone begins to see the ghosts of these newly departed servants , and when she explores the reasons with Ms . Grose we discover the Ms . Grose was in love with Miss Jessel and hated Peter Quint . Anna is frequently visited by nightmares of her own sexual abuse as a young girl and transfers these fears onto Flora and Miles , feeling that they were similarly abused - an explanation for their bizarre behavior patterns . Ms . Grose acts out her sexuality with Anna , confusing Anna even more , and stressing her vulnerable psyche into thinking she can exorcise the demons of the house . And the ending will surprise us all ! Director Donato Rotunno needs to re-read the James novella and rely on the audience's intelligence more than to alter the story to become faddist and frank instead of subtle and suspenseful . A major problem with the casting is the far too frequently physically exposed Leelee Sobieski : it feels as though she is reading her rather pedestrian lines from a cue card off camera . It is a sad imitation of the governess . Tara Fitzgerald's Ms . Grose is not the obese , matronly of the original , but instead a very svelte and seductive woman : she succeeds in creating a credible alternative figure very well . The setting and photography are fine , but the musical score by Adam Pendse is a pedestrian mix of incongruous styles . In short , if you are a fan of Henry James , avoid this sloppy work . But then , if Leelee Sobieski is a favorite , then you see more of her as a grown woman than you probably will ever see again ! Not Recommended . Grady Harp
512680	3223254	294870	3.0	A Committed Cast Salvages Rent	Having seen RENT on the stage with the eardrum assaulting , miked sound from each performer's head mike coupled with the small but deadly ' pit band ' this viewer rented this film with trepidation . And after paying close attention to the transfer of the play to the screen little has change in feelings about this work . Loosely based on Puccini's ' La Boheme ' ( with some direct quotes in the score ) this musical drama has much to say about AIDS , kids as artists , survival , all forms of gay life , extended family - many subjects that make it worthy of production . The cast performs extremely well from the opening ' Chorus Line ' takeoff through the intimate and blaring production numbers . The pacing is excellent , the cinematography is good , the mood is right . So why the three star rating ? For this viewer / listener the score is so thread bare and trite that it is difficult to understand why it has attracted such huge success . There is one song ( which opens the show ) and otherwise the rest of the score melts into an indistinguishable mélange of repetition . The cast carries it off admirably , but at the end of the work the impact is more in the idea than the execution . Overrated . Grady Harp , February 06
512640	3223254	363048	3.0	Thin Thread of a Story for what appears to be Brazilian Travelogue	' Saudade - Sehnsucht ' ( THE LONGING ) is a film by writer / director Jürgen Brüning who seems to have taken a vacation from Germany to Brazil with some friends and decided to make a movie as a means of entertainment . This film is less about characters and story development than it is about Brazilian beaches , snorkeling , fish butchering , second-rate pop music , and food . Ostensibly we find three friends who've had a rock band in Germany on vacation in Brazil : Cyrus ( Tarik Qazi ) is interested in finding his Brazilian mother ; Tim ( Daniel Bätscher ) remains determined to explore a new music sound ; Erik ( eye candy hunk Hendrik Scheider ) wants to find love . The three finance their excursion by making daily film clips of body contact to use on the internet dating business . Their housekeepers Maria ( Maria Lucia da Silva Ludwig ) and Angela ( Marilza da Cruz Pinto Gregião ) feed their interests as well as their appetites . Most of their time is spent in clubs and at the beaches , pursuing little but opportunism . Erik has a tryst on the sand with a Brazilian man one night that ends in a death that sours his desire . When another attractive Brazilian lad Miguel ( Aldri Anunciação ) catches Erik's eye the two begin a struggle for a relationship , but Erik's previous encounter colors his ability to find happiness . The actors are all attractive and given the fact that they have little to do but look alluring manage to make the film tolerable . But in the end the movie feels too self indulgent to satisfy any audience member . It is a piece of fluff disguised as a soap opera . Grady Harp
512912	3223254	810077	3.0	An Idea That Never Takes Flight	THE UNTOUCHABLE requires patience on the part of the viewer - patience to stay with this sullen , dark and clunky film to the end only to discover the wait was not worth the patience ! Writer / director Benoît Jacquot had a good idea : trace the search for a biological father to a country foreign to the seeker . What results instead of a journey of self-discovery is a travelogue to India as captured by a hand held camera with what appears to be a minuscule budget . Jeanne ( Isild Le Besco ) discovers on her eighteenth birthday that her mother ( Bérangère Bonvoisin ) conceived her on the banks of the Ganges River in India with an Indian man who remains unknown . Furious at her mother's secret and feeling the profound need to connect with her biological father , Jeanne , an actress , leaves her acting workshop to make a racy film in order to make enough money to travel to India . Once in India she searches for traces of her father without success . But the search is not without some interest for the viewer : the hand held camera that follows her through the airport and the countryside and to Benares ( that city by the Ganges where the dead are cremated in elaborate fashion and the living bathe in the waters of the holy river ) . She gathers clues as to her father's identity from friendly strangers , but alas , the riddle remains unsolved . Isild Le Besco is in practically every frame of this film and she indeed is an interesting actress to watch . But the lack of intelligent dialogue prevents this film from revealing motivations or character development , opting instead for a static ( and rather poorly edited and scored ) glance at the mysteries of India . For those interested in watching in detail the preparation of bodies for cremation and the slow act of that ritual , this is a film worth watching . For the casual viewer it is tedious . Grady Harp
513599	3223254	457513	4.0	A Woody Allen Relapse	Woody Allen seems to have two personas : one writes and directs works such sensitive works as Matchpoint and Interiors , the other writes and directs himself in silly slapstick movies that only a Woody Allen fan tireless of his old used jokes and self promotion can tolerate , such as Scoop . This flimsy film seems to have been designed to give Allen screen time for his tired jokes in the company of some very good actors . Splitting his tale between Charon's boat crossing the river Styx with recently departed dead people on board then transferring their conversations about the ' scoop ' of revealing a society stud as a Tarot Serial Killer via the machinations of the ridiculous magician entry point into contemporary life , Allen cares little about plot cohesion and more about the quick one-liners . The good thing about the film is the cast : Hugh Jackman , Scarlett Johansson , Ian McShane , and Romola Garai are creative actors who so their best to help Allen pull off this sleeper . Definitely restricted audience for fans of Woody Allen's whiny humor only . No wonder it failed in the theaters ! Grady Harp
512853	3223254	496350	4.0	Fright Flight	THE MARSH is yet another scary movie to satisfy the apparently inexhaustible demand for fright films of this genre . It is obviously a low budget film that suffers from a silly script resurrecting tired themes of communication with ghosts and the intervention of paranormal specialists . Successful children's book author and illustrator Claire Holloway ( Gabrielle Anwar ) is besieged by recurrent nightmares that prompt her therapist to recommend a sabbatical , advice she heeds as she moves out into the country to a little creepy town called Marshville . She rents a old house near the marsh from a woman Mercy ( Brooke Johnson ) and discovers from the local newspaper editor Noah ( Justin Louis ) that the town is riddled with history of hauntings following the disappearance of a little girl into the marshes , the victim of sexual assault that has never been adequately investigated . Claire's time in her new ' home ' is racked with appearances of the dead little girl and her muddy perpetrator and she finally seeks the help of a Paranormal expert Hunt ( Forest Whitaker ) who helps her solve the etiology of Claire's nightmares and provides an exit for the ghosts . Most of the film is dark with poor Claire just wandering around the creepy house with her open-mouthed / wide-eyed frightened look , avoiding the flying detritus caused by the angry spirits that haunt her . Gabrielle Anwar is beautiful to look at but is not really called upon to act . Likewise Forest Whitaker is paralyzed by an inept script that even this fine actor can't overcome . The music is the canned , synthesizer variety and the camera work is jerky and gets in the way of the story . This is a movie for avid fans of scary flicks who can overlook the multiple production and writing problems . Grady Harp
512997	3223254	781435	4.0	A Very Slow Evening	Honoré De Balzac's novel ' La Duchesse Du Langeais ' has been transformed by screenwriter Pascal Bonitzer for the screen as ' Ne Touchez Pas a la Hache ' and the result is a mixture of proscenium stage pictures , and scenes separated by written dialog that merely lets the viewer know such unnecessary details such as that fact that time has passed , and well over two hours of an uninvolved courtship between a sensualist and a coquette . While it is a pleasure to remember the times of Balzac and his way with lusty themes , watching this film version can be tedious - at best . Fans of director Jacques Rivette will find much to enjoy in this adaptation : the pacing of the film feels important to his concept of the development of the story - the stifling boredom of the evenings of balls in Paris and the isolation of the soldiers ' lives , deprived of the companionship of lovely ladies . He has cast Jeanne Balibar as the title character Antoinette De Langeais , a married lady of means with a penchant for flirting and coquettish behavior with important men , and Guillaume Depardieu as General Armand De Montriveau , a war hero who lost his leg and returns to Paris vulnerable for love , namely in the instant attraction to Antoinette . The tale is one of a game of the General's passionate love and the duchess ' toying with his advances until a climax is reached which changes the approach of each character with rather disastrous consequences for both . As a period piece the film works well : the costumes and settings are splendid and the scenes in the endless ballrooms are full of grace and lovely music . But the flow of the encounters between Antoinette and Armand are an interminable series of momentary repetitious encounters with a sound track that seems bent on capturing the opening and closing of doors and the loud pacing of the crippled general as he enters and leaves the naughty lady's chamber . There is little to draw us into caring for the characters and after the first hour and a half of the film the courtship begs our indulgence . In French with English subtitles . Definitely recommended for fans of Jacques Rivette's films or Balzac's stories , but a ' long song ' for casual viewers . Grady Harp
513100	3223254	387877	4.0	' The Black Dahlia ' : A Misnomer of a Title	Brian de Palma made an odd decision in creating this apparently very expensive , very strange and confusing version of a film , a movie less about the grisly / twisted unsolved murder ( grossly illustrated ad infinitum here ) of a wannabe 1940s actress of the title and more about two boxer cops ( bland Josh Hartnett as ' Mr . Ice ' and over the top Aaron Eckhart as ' Mr . Fire ' ) and their bizarre ménage a trois with unfocused Scarlett Johansson . The film as written by Josh Friedman attempts to follow the novel by James Ellroy , itself a strange riff on the Black Dahlia murder . What results is an over produced , over directed , under realized recreation of the 1940s complete with slicky costumes and very loud music by ( surprisingly ! ) Mark Isham . There are so many subplots filled with walk on characters that keeping the story understandable is almost impossible - certainly not worth an attempt to capsulize for a review . There are some terrific little performances by Fiona Shaw as the druggie mad woman whose role becomes significant only at film's end , Hilary Swank as the copycat Dahlia who dallies in cops and soldiers and lesbians ( convincingly so ) , and Mia Kirshner who presence as the true Black Dahlia is shown only in black and white film clips that indeed focus the unwieldy script while she is on ! Odd to see actors with the credentials of this cast wandering around in la-la land seemingly looking for a script that makes sense . But it is a pretty period piece to look at despite the lack of reasonable storyline . Grady Harp
512683	3223254	244684	4.0	Nessun dorma . . . ZZZZZZZZZZZ	Jochen Hick wrote and directed this little thriller of a suspense film based on the concept that the AIDS virus was a sheep virus mutated by the government to rid the world of gays and was apparently tested on convicts in the years before the outbreak of the hideous disease . Were it not for the poignancy of the concept of the film , this would fall into the category of the many films about the ruination of the world by a rampant non-prejudicial infective organism . Stefan ( Tom Wlaschiha ) journeys from Berlin to San Francisco to investigate his father's scientific suppositions about the induced sheep virus and its effects of the convicts in whom it was infused . He meets with some disdain and resistance to a dead theory , but also encounters some folks who know of the theory and support his investigation . Simultaneously with his visit a series of serial murders takes place , each victim killed in a similar manner and each murder apparently accompanied by strains of music from Puccini's opera ' Turandot ' which just happens to be opening at the San Francisco Opera . A police investigator Louise Tolliver ( Irit Levi ) and her companion cop ( Kalene Parker ) follow the murders while Stefan makes the rounds of the sex clubs and bars in San Francisco trying to locate men who may have been guinea pigs for his father's theory . He encounters a strange lad Jeffrey ( Jim Thalman ) with whom he has a cat and mouse attraction and a prominent Doctor Burroughs ( Richard Conti ) who seems oddly involved in the cast of suspects . How this all come to an end is the play of the film , a story as much about the search for self identity between Stefan and Jeffery as it is a case for investigation of murders . While Tom Wlaschiha , Jim Thalman and Richard Conti do well with their roles ( they are the only three who have any prior acting experience in the film ! ) , the quality of the film sags considerably by the less than acceptable minimally talented Irit Levy and Kaylene Parker : when on screen the credibility of the story drops below zero . There are some small cameos by other actors that brighten the screen for the moments they inhabit , but in all the film is drowned by the incessant replay of ' Nessun dorma ' as sung by Mario del Monaco from a recording o the opera - and that seems to be the reason for making the film ! Good idea for a film and some good characterizations by the actors , but there is no resolution of the initial premise that started the whole thing . Grady Harp , February 06
512706	3223254	398029	4.0	Lots of Story Threads and Variety of Actors Stumbling to Find a Plot	THE LAST DROP could have been a better WW II film had the writer and director decided on the focus . The directorial choices vary from very fine ( mixing black and white grainy shots from war footage with stagy though competent settings in color ) to questionable ( allowing a musical score including steel guitar music and contemporary sounds to intrude into a time when such instrumentation was not even known ) to mediocre ( allowing the actors to be caricatures instead of players in a tense drama ) . Essentially the story is set before Christmas with the dropping of troops via gliders into Holland to secure a secret mission involving looted Nazi treasure . The Germans are fast-driving to capture it and send it to Berlin before the Allies land . The British team is determined to maintain custody of the goods until war's end . And then of course there is a group of self-promoting Germans who simply want to capture the treasure for their own reward . Not a bad set of conflicts , but the film's problems are centered on some bad casting choices that prevent the momentum from being as relentlessly forward as good war films should . Some of the cast members look so much alike that it becomes difficult to determine just who is who : in one case this is intentional as the plot reveals in its ending , but in most cases it is a problem due to cramped dialects , stiff acting , and over the top parody . With the exception of Billy Zane and Michael Madsen there are no big names here and in many ways that is a good thing because the two stars are the weakest characters . Though the plot outline has possibilities - what is war but greed under different names - the mixture of ribald humor and gut-wrenching realism fail to make the story work . Grady Harp
513002	3223254	420740	5.0	A Dark Story in a Dark Place Without the Benefit of a Director's Enlightenment	A LITTLE TRIP TO HEAVEN is a strange little Indie film by Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur , a young director with some very fine ideas but with a script ( written both by the director and Edward Martin Weinman ) ' that is so spongy that the impact of the film relies on the considerable qualities of the cinematic images . Filmed primarily in Iceland with some scenes in Hastings , Minnesota , the mood is dank and dark and cold - and so is the story . We first meet insurance investigator ( ' adjustor ' ) Abe Holt as he listens to his boss Frank ( Peter Coyote ) explain to a new widow why she will not receive full death benefits because the insurance company took photos of her husband smoking , the apparent cause of his death . Abe just sits in the background but we know he is in tune with the fraudulent activity of the insurance company . Almost immediately he is assigned to a new case : an ex-con with a million dollar life insurance policy has apparently been found dead in a car crash burned beyond recognition . Abe drives to the tiny snowy desolate village where his questions of the townsfolk reveal that the victim was Kelvin Anderson , the brother of Isold ( Julia Stiles ) who is married to a low life type named Fred ( Jeremy Renner ) , a man who we have seen in flashbacks as the one responsible for arranging the car crash and setting the car on fire . Abe sneaks around the town , spies on Isold , and becomes involved in the investigation in more ways than the honest one . It is the interplay of the three - Abe , Fred , and Isold - that provide the intrigue and mystery of the apparent framed insurance scam . The screenplay is so full of holes that it is difficult to follow the case's development . The actors are superb artists : Forest Whitaker made this film almost simultaneously with his Oscar winning ' The Last King of Scotland ' yet here his character is plagued by an affected accent and by the lack of substance that might make us care about his plight ; Julia Stiles does her best with the little she is given to do and Jeremy Renner is convincingly menacing without any factors that make us find him worth caring about . The supporting actors ( Joanna Scanlan as a sleazy bartender , Iddo Goldberg and Philip Jackson as the police , Alfred Harmsworth as the ' son ' of Isold , and Vladas Bagdonas as the coroner ) actually fare better than the leads as far as material available . The strong aspect of the film is the visual imagery , due to the decisions of picture composition by Kormákur and cinematographer Óttar Guðnason and Mugison's musical is apropos for the mood . But the film remains grounded and a bit on the confusing side because of the director's lack of unity . One wonders why Whitaker , Stiles , and Renner signed on to this little film . Grady Harp
512933	3223254	299458	5.0	Finding Love and Attempting Privacy in a Small Town	ALL THE REAL GIRLS is strange little film written and directed by David Gordon Green , an attempt to capture the claustrophobia of a small North Carolina town where finding love in the midst of an atmosphere devoid of secrets . It boasts a strong cast , has some moments of touching repartee , but in the end we are left with a lack of feeling for / caring about any of the characters . Green's fidgety camera work , jumbled scene changes , and lack of character development prevent the good points to out weigh the weak ones . Hometown lothario Paul ( Paul Schneider ) is best friends with another womanizer Tip ( Shea Whigham ) whose sister Noel ( Zooey Deschanel ) returns home from a boarding school and falls for Paul . Paul and Noel do a courtship dance , the first act of a relationship that includes more talk and self-confession than physical . Tip objects to Paul's interest in his sister and this of course only fans the flame of romance . The cadre of homeboys ( Danny R . McBride and Maurice Compte ) watch on the sidelines as the Romeo and Juliet affair takes place . Paul's mother ( Patricia Clarkson ) and uncle ( Benjamin Mouton ) add what words of twisted wisdom they can . The love affair is the first serious relationship Paul has ever encountered and for the first time it is the girl who throws the wrench into the experience , a factor that allows the story to simply end . With a cast that includes some truly gifted actors ( Deschanel and Clarkson especially ) the viewer has to reflect on why there is no true concern for anybody in the film , no screen chemistry and no charisma that would have helped make this belabored effort worthwhile . David Gordon Green is young and has some very sound ideas about film , but he needs to talk to his audiences about communication to enable him to make solid movies . Grady Harp

Yes , we are all aware of the Rampart scandal that perhaps is the nidus for this story , but what DIRTY shows is a group of despicable , foul mouthed , evil , crime perpetrating opportunists who will do anything to make a hit - all ' protected ' by a police force that condones their actions . Cuba Gooding , Jr . is a fine actor whose recent roles have not allowed him to demonstrate his craft . Perhaps he wanted a role as a bad guy ( in the vein of Denzel Washington , Richard Gere et al who opt for smarmy roles to ' prove ' their acting grit ! ) , but he is artificial in this film as a man willing and waiting to do filthy deeds without conscience . He is paired with the also fine actor Clifton Collins , Jr . as the Hispanic equivalent of Gooding's Black bad cop . The story jumps all over the place with so many subplots and characters identifiable only by their total body tattoo differences and hampered by a script that depends on the F word and the N word and MF word as a means of communication . Gooding and Collins are partners and while Gooding seems to be the major offender to decency , Collins does little about it , leading us to believe he is an innocent victim to the Internal Affairs investigation that appears to be the endpoint of this drama . Just when the viewer is saturated by the dirt of this film's techniques and story , the gritty collision of loyalty and redemption enters at the very end , making reflection on the tale that has been assaulting our senses almost embarrassing for the viewer . In the police code , what is permissible , what is wrong , what is justifiable ? Fighting crime with crime doesn't seem a viable answer , but we are left asking the question ' What is ? ' A disturbing film on many levels , not the least of which is the fact that Gooding's agent needs a heads up on finding this gifted actor some worthy roles ! Grady Harp
513094	3223254	418294	5.0	Worthwhile and Important Story Hampered by Poor Script and Production	THE VIRGIN OF JUAREZ is based on true events surrounding the crime problems of Juarez , Mexico reflected in the gringo exploitation of businesses in neighboring El Paso , Texas . The story contains many important facts that desperately need to be brought into the light , but the impact of the film falters because of the choices made by the writer and director . Karina Danes ( Minnie Driver ) is a journalist for a Los Angeles newspaper who has flown to Juarez to investigate the multiple ( in the hundreds ) killings of young women . The targets for these murders seem to be young women working in the US sponsored sweatshops in Juarez who are picked up at night after work , raped , beaten and killed . Danes is convinced the Juarez police force is doing nothing and takes on the mission of exposing the tragedies , in part due to her own past issues of being to idle with similar crimes in the US . She meets Father Herrera ( Esai Morales ) and a community activist Patrick ( Angus MacFadyen ) and together they probe the police files and follow the most recent murder , discovering along the way a survivor named Mariela ( Ana Claudia Talancón ) , a frightened young girl whose memory of her rape and beating is erased by her apparent vision of the Virgin Mary . A father of one of the victims , Isidro ( Jorge Cervera , Jr . ) nurtures Mariela and helps her to escape the hospital , placing her in a ' church ' where she becomes a ' saint ' to the people of Juarez who long for the crimes to end . Mariela appears to the public with the stigmata of bleeding hands and offers hope to the victims ' families . Danes works hard to discover evidence that will expose the perpetrators , taking a sheet of photos of ' most wanted men ' from the police office of Detective Lauro ( Jacob Vargas ) , and works with the police and Father Herrera to resolve the tragic chain of events that continue in Juarez . Fearing for Mariela's life , they transport her to Los Angeles where mysterious events end the story . The squeaky , mawkish script was written by Michael Fallon and directed by Kevin James Dobson . Had their vision been more directed toward defining the line between realism and fanaticism , the story would possibly have been better related . There are some good performances by Driver , Talancón , Morales , and Vargas but the minor roles vary in quality . Reporting atrocities such as the one this film addresses is a valid and valuable contribution of contemporary cinema . It is sad when script and the production dull the impact . Grady Harp
513462	3223254	496319	5.0	A Talky , Self-Indulgent Film Despite a Fine Cast	Ethan Hawke wrote the book THE HOTTEST STATE and then proceeded to write the screenplay , direct and act in it . Sometimes that combination works , but in this instance the whole project feels like a narcissistic self-indulgent autobiographical talky two hours . Hawke is respected enough among his peers that he was able to draw a fine cast together in an attempt to make this film work , but in the end it is pretty boring . Young Texas actor William ( Mark Webber ) has moved to New York to make it big , and while he gets jobs , he feels as though he doesn't have a handle on relationships . When he meets the beautiful singer Sarah ( Catalina Sandino Moreno ) he falls in love but has no idea how to court his dream girl . Sarah is cautious about relationships , too , yet is attracted to William and consents to travel to Mexico to heat up their bonding . In Mexico they spend the greater part of their time consummating their love affair : the love scenes are fairly erotic , especially on the part of Moreno . Returning to their jobs in New York the two face problems in continuing their relationship . William's divorced parents ( Laura Linney and Ethan Hawke ) have their own demons that prevent their providing William with much consolation , and Sarah's mother ( Sonia Braga ) has a rather negative view of relationships . How the film finally winds down with dealing with William's whining and Sarah's resistance is all that is left of the lengthy diatribe . Though Linney , Braga , Michelle Williams ( in too short a role ) , and Moreno try to make this story tolerable , it is inherent in the concept that William ( Ethan Hawke poorly disguised ) is just too boring a guy to care about . Mark Webber is supposed to have the promise and charisma of a ' new Brando ' ( according to the hype ) , but he is flat in this film . The soundtrack is wearing and rarely takes a break for the dialog . Hawke can and has done better . Hopefully he has released his ego in this film and can move on . Grady Harp
512771	3223254	826600	5.0	Love , Relationships , and Trials	PHOENIX is the third feature by Michael D . Akers as a director and writer ( here sharing the credits with Sandon Berg ) and as with his other two features ' Matrimonium ' and ' Gone , But Not Forgotten ' there is a sense that Akers knows how to tell a good story , a story based on universal themes but just happening to be using gay characters to explain a similarity in all manners of love whether they be straight or gay . LVN Dylan ( Chad Bartley ) is celebrating his 23rd birthday by setting his apartment with flowers and dinner , expecting his love of one year to arrive for the surprise . The love is Ken ( Gaetano Jones ) who arrives late and barely notices the setting , giving Dylan a clay vase as a gift and then telling him he must dash off to Phoenix for a failing real estate deal . Dylan is hurt then angry and breaks his gift , sending Ken off to Phoenix in a miff . Sorry for his behavior Dylan takes the money enclosed in a Birthday card from his folks and flies to Phoenix to apologize to Ken . But surprises arise in Phoenix : Ken is missing , Dylan traces the broken vase to discover chef / ceramist Demetrius ( Jeff Castle ) and learns that Ken and Demetrius have been partnered for seven years ! Neither Dylan nor Demetrius is pleased with Ken's lying and cheating but they gradually admit to finding solace with each other and spend time together , including a physical encounter that leads to others as the two prolong Dylan's stay . How the love triangle is broken but remains influential is the resolution of the story . Akers has the sensitivity to not make the story have the happy-wappy Hollywood ending : he also has the talent to capture love encounters in a very sensual way . The actors are all attractive men and given the lack of prior experience each has had , they offer fairly strong performances - especially Chad Bartley . The film is desperately in need of editing as there are extraneous scenes galore ( the landscape scenes are far to brightly sun drenched for the desert locales captured . But in the end the film is successful in that it does present the joys , trials , and disappointments in love relationships in the gay community that could have easily been in a straight character movie - and that is refreshing !

513273	3223254	449851	5.0	A Plodding , Predictable French Farce : Out of Character	For centuries the French have had the market on light , elegant , stylish , fluffy and tasty comedy , both in the theater and on film . Unfortunately THE VALET ( LA DOUBLURE ) doesn't rise to those standards . Though written by Francis Veber , who gave us the ' La Cage Aux Folles ' series and ' La Placard ' , seems to understand the genre as well as anyone , the script for this much-used story is bland and lacks the sparkle and inventiveness of Veber's successes . The tale is one of marital infidelity : a wealthy man Pierre ( Daniel Auteuil ) is married to elegant and intelligent Christine ( Kristin Scott Thomas ) and having an affair with top model Elena ( Alice Taglioni ) for two years . Elena is demanding Pierre divorce his wife or she will leave him and Pierre fears the financial repercussions of divorce . Enter a simpleton valet François Pignon ( Gad Elmaleh ) who is hopelessly in love with bookstore owner Émilie ( Virginie Ledoyen ) , the daughter of his father's strange physician who is more concentrated on salvaging her business than on paying attention to François's romantic overtures . Accidentally François walks past Pierre and Elena on the street , is captured by the tabloids , and when Christine sees the picture the infidelity is questioned : Pierre seeks his lawyer's advice and the tow plot to have Elena live with François to foil Christine's suspicions . Of course the loser François and the gold digger Elena learn from their roles and the story grinds to a rather silly ending . The cast is excellent but just doesn't ignite sparks on the screen . We are left with characters for whom we have little sympathy , and where is comedy if we cannot find at least one player to support ? It is a pleasure to see the beautiful Kristin Scott Thomas toss off a French role with such aplomb , but the talents of the others rarely rise above the mediocre - and that is amazing considering the quality of the cast . A disappointing film . Grady Harp
513355	3223254	469689	5.0	A Transparent Attempt to Create a Psychological ' Thriller '	Michael Caleo's background in writing for television shows in this flimsy little flick that despite a solid cast comes across as tired retelling of the bad guy to good guy to bad guy sequences . There are some good one-liners in the film , with a script that is so peppered with the ' f ' word that it is crippled by it , but the story has been done before and much better and this time around the ' twist ' is obvious from the film's opening lines . Goofus-doofus Midwesterner Jaime ( Brendan Fraser ) has moved form Ohio to New York with his gorgeous girlfriend Belisa ( Amber Valletta ) to join a sales company whose chief salesman is foul mouthed , ill tempered Ted ( Michael Keaton ) who appears to loathe everyone and the world . Jaime is assigned to Ted , but Jaime's level of intelligence borders on idiocy and his fate with the company seems doomed . . . until Jaime introduces Belisa to Ted . . . and the romantic fireworks start . Ted falls for Belisa and begins to change his outlook , confiding his inner spirit as a professor of English literature to Belisa . A transformation takes place and as Jaime spirals downward while Ted and Belisa's affair ignites , role reversal happens as a not at all surprising plot unfolds . Michael Keaton is a fine actor and makes the best of this mouthy role , but Brendan Fraser's talents are completely wasted - a hint from the start that all is not as it appears . . . It is a mediocre movie and even if the audience doesn't turn off the soundtrack to rid the script of the trashy language , it can become insulting to the intellect . But again , Keaton helps it float . Grady Harp
513651	3223254	405422	6.0	An Adult Version of the Teeny Flicks	Raucous humor , outrageous interpersonal situations , potty mouth , and over the top jokes have long been the successful turf of countless summer movies aimed at the teen crowd , films such as the endless American Pie series , Dumb and Dumberer , There's Something About Mary , etc . Now there is a new trend aimed at the thirty to forty something audiences that mimics the earlier teen subjects . THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN falls into this category along with WEDDING CRASHERS et al , but there is a difference with this one : empathy . The story is slight : an uptight , loner , action heroes collecting , non-driving bicycle-riding punctual worker in a boring firm is now forty years old and is still a virgin - a fact that bothers him deeply but his virginity has developed into a phobia for close encounters of the female kind . His work partners discover his secret over poker and pledge to resolve the problem by getting him laid , in some of the most negative possible of suggestions . After endless trials to resolve his sexual vacuum he meets a forty something grandmother and in a mutually agreed pact they decide to date without sex for 20 dates before they allow physical activity to occur . In the process the friends at work ( including the seductive female manager ) learn a thing or two about their own life styles and the film ends in a bizarre musical number that pushes it over the top while tapping at the heart . Steve Carell co-wrote the script ( with Director Judd Apatow ) and it shows . His ' Andy ' may be a nerd but his adaptation to his problematic existence is sweet and charismatic . Likewise , his office entourage ( Paul Rudd , Seth Rogen , Romany Jay , Jane Lynch ) gives us three-dimensional characters each of which shows some personal growth of their own during their experiments for Andy . The real glow of the film is due to the presence of Catherine Keener as the ' grandmother ' for whom Andy falls . Whenever she is on the screen lights flash and reality sets in . The real problem for this viewer is that the slapstick portion of the film simply goes on too long . Apatow needs to rethink comedy in a way that reminds him that brevity is better : two hours is way too long for this very short story . Though it has redeeming graces , this is a film for a audience tolerant of the silly and the gross who is willing to wade through the first three-fourths of the film to catch the quietly tender social comment the film contains .

512735	3223254	462641	6.0	Reading Between the Lines	ZONA ROSA is a colorful , lively , and entertaining documentary about the young men who are male strippers in the gay clubs of Mexico City's Zona Rosa . The credible parts of the film are those showing the actual dancing that takes place in these famous clubs : the controversial aspect of the ' documentary ' is that portion ( the major part ) of the film that goes out of its way to emphasize that all of these hunky stripping Latin men are straight and are doing this work for the art of it and for female customers ! Indeed , almost all the shots of the men in action on the stages of these clubs focus on the front rows of people in attendance - and naturally those are women , in gay clubs , without men in sight . . . . Director Dan Castle uses a lot of film to interview one Christian , an exotic dancer in the most famous of the clubs , and the interview includes footage of his approving mother , his young son ( he is divorced and living at home ) , and repeated declarations that exotic dancing cannot be examined as a preface to any other aspects of life . Likewise his fellow dancers are interviewed , declaring that the dances are intended for female clientèle , while at the same time the young studs are adamant in their claims that women are rude and intrusive whereas the gay clientèle are respectful of their roles as entertainers ( wherever those reverential men might be hiding in the club shots ) . Jump ahead one year and we see Christian living with his protégé , a body builder / trainer who Christian is prepping as a stripper , each of the two men commenting at length about each other's physical erotic attributes . . . The DVD ' Extra ' is an extended survey of several of the men's dancing routines , dances that ultimately include full frontal nudity . There is also a funny ' banana contest ' which in many ways seems demeaning to the contestants . Along the way in this film we see interviews with club owners describing their complete control of the shows , gay activists who talk about the police censorship of the clubs , the failed attempts at gay pride parades , the closure of 60 of the clubs in 2001 , and the lack of a vocal gay community . All of this goes along with the ' Latin macho ' concept that everything associated with male stripping in gay clubs is solely for the pleasure of women . It leaves the viewer wondering why the very erotic film was made in the first place ! Hello ? Grady Harp , September 06
513372	3223254	206420	6.0	A Tasty Dish , but more of just a side dish	WOMAN ON TOP is one of those films that was made , publicized and viewed as pastiche and because of its honesty as a simple romantic comedy , it rates higher than many of the over the top and overproduced competitors . The film is colorful , filled with wonderful Bossa Nova music , and has enough eye candy to almost make you forget the main dishes ! Isabella Oliveira ( Penélope Cruz ) lives in Bahia , Brazil totally in love with Toninho Oliveira ( Murilo Benício ) where the two have a restaurant featuring Isabella's passionate cooking and Toninho's macho front man role . Isabella has a problem : motion sickness - she cannot fly , ride in a car , or assume the bottom position during sex or she becomes violently ill ( it seems that the sea goddess compensated her problem by making her an inimitable chef ) . All is well until Toninho has a brief affair that drives the crushed Isabella to move to San Francisco alone despite her love for Toninho . There she moves in with her old friend Monica from Bahia ( Harold Perrineau as a superbly enacted crossed dressed drag queen ) and begins her unsuccessful search for a job . In order to overcome her longing for Toninho and regain her culinary skills she makes a pact with the sea goddess , forsaking ever loving Toninho again . Eventually Isabella lands a TV show on Passionate Cooking when desperate producer Cliff ( Mark Feuerstein ) gets a whiff of her talent . She is an immediate success . Meanwhile Toninho , unable to endure life in Bahia without Isabella , flies to San Francisco and begins a series of Bossa Nova serenades to win her back . Cliff places Toninho on Isabella's show as background music and the ratings soar . But it is the ultimately the conflict resolution between Isabella and Toninho that brings the story to its expected end . The story may be light and the script may be pedestrian , but the direction and camera work suffuse this film with Latin American magical realism and that keeps it lighthearted and fun . Cruz is terrific , Perrineau is the true star of the show displaying a sophisticated and sensitive acting skill that is very special , and Murilo Benício is not only a hunk and eye candy but also a fine singer and a warm actor who deserves a lot of attention . Story five , stars six . Have fun with this one ! Grady Harp , March 06
513304	3223254	455805	6.0	Bonding : Necessities and Consequences	In a featurette on the DVD release version of THEN SHE FOUND ME writer ( with Alice Arlen and Victor Levin ) / producer / director Helen Hunt shares a ten year journey to have a film made of a novel by Elinor Lipman . Her cast shares in the very sentimental story of Hunt's devotion and seemingly endless charisma and abilities . The explanation for making this budget film are in many ways more successful than the film , a work the cast seems determined to classify as a comedy but a work that is far more a human drama . April Epner ( Helen Hunt ) is married to fellow schoolteacher Ben Green ( Matthew Broderick ) and longs to have a baby before her advancing age prevents her dream . April was adopted as an infant by a Jewish couple who subsequently gave birth to April's brother Freddy ( Ben Shenkman ) : April has always longed to have been Freddy's biological equal , wondering what it would feel like NOT to be adopted . April's busy life implodes : Ben has decided he doesn't like his life and leaves April , April's mother dies , April meets Frank ( Colin Firth ) a recently divorced writer and father of two children , and April is contacted by a man who can put April in touch with her birth mother - popular TV talk show hostess Bernice Graves ( Bette Midler ) . And if these turns of events weren't traumatic enough , April discovers that she has become pregnant by Ben and Ben is unsure whether he can handle the restructuring of his life to accommodate April . Cautiously April and Frank begin a rather tenuous courtship which is almost immediately threatened by April's discovery of her pregnant state . April and Bernice meet , exchange backgrounds , and make pacts to test their biologic relationship . How each of these characters makes promises that eventually damage each other and then resolve in unexpected ways becomes a study of the meaning of love and compassion among fragile human beings . While not a satisfying story on every level and a film too cluttered with inconvenient editing choices , the cast is strong and obviously committed , and the story ( neither a comedy or a drama but a mixture of the two ) tests credibility . But there are some fine moments and the lessons in human behavior are worth examining . Not a great movie but a strong little small budget film . Grady Harp
513329	3223254	134033	6.0	Sometimes Silly Is What You Want !	PLUNKETT & MACLEANE has a purpose : entertainment . And during a season of rush and deadlines this little film provides enough anachronistic pleasures to fill a relaxing evening . The story is simple : two social polar opposites with reasons for distaste for society join forces to rob the rich . And all the rest is fantasy and period tongue in cheek humor . Jonny Lee Miller is the cleaner of the two and Robert Carlyle the scruffy intuitive thief . The two fall under different influences piloted by such fine actors as Liv Tyler , Alan Cumming , and Michael Gambon . This is high rolling farce with a silly but fun musical score and wonderful period costumes and mannerisms . It is not deep , it is not particularly good , but it IS entertaining . This kind of fluff leaves you whistling with a smile . Grady Harp
512901	3223254	430919	6.0	' And may the best man win . . . '	UNHITCHED is a fairly well made , generic Hollywood love story that provides a reasonably entertaining evening because of the actors cast in the roles . The story by director Stefan Schwartz and Ed Roe is recycled fluff with nothing new added , yet despite that fact the pacing and acting bring off a fun little film . As marriage enters the agenda of old friends , promiscuous James ( Steve John Shepherd ) is scheduled to marry Sarah ( Amy Smart , always a pleasure to watch ) and asks his best friend Olly ( the talented and hunky Irishman Stuart Townsend in a very nice comedic turn ) to be his Best Man . Olly , a writer whose first chapters have been lauded by his publisher ( Simon Callow ) and that early praise has thrown him into writer's block forcing him to take a menial job as a PA under grumpy feminist Tania ( Johdi May ) , fears accepting the role of Best Man out of the challenge tied to writing the wedding reception speech . He is encouraged not to accept the role by his roommate friend Murray ( 5'4 " Seth Green , who has many comedy roles to his credit - this one being the first with a fine British accent ) . Murray knows of James ' peppered past and sets out to stop the wedding - especially when he discovers that Olly has fallen for Sarah , mistaking her for Sarah's Maid of Honor Becka ( Kate Ashfield ) . Olly is a true friend and will sacrifice his longing for Sarah out of his loyalty to James - until Murray proves that James indeed is a promiscuous lothario . And the chase , with many a pratfall , begins as Olly ultimately sides with Murray to prevent his losing Sarah . Townsend makes a fine turn out of his obvious role , proving that he not only can master dramatic and intrigue roles , but light comedy ones as well . Seth Green may be small but he is a powerhouse of physical comedic talent . Amy Smart doesn't have much to do , but when she is on screen she glows with intelligence as well as beauty . It is the cast that makes this film work and they are enough of a pleasure to watch to merit sitting through another re-telling of a tired story . Grady Harp
513565	3223254	466909	7.0	THE OMEN : A More Humanistic Approach	Remembering the 1976 new film THE OMEN this viewer recalls someone making a dog growling sound in the parking lot at movie's end and how that effect sent gasps and chills through those who had just witnessed Damien and his dogs - a sign of a thoroughly successful thriller . Now thirty years later ( and having the original effect watered down by the subsequent three sequels ) out comes a remake of THE OMEN and once again the story and production values of the film jolt even the more staid viewers . Armageddon now seems frightfully at hand ! Though the script is essentially intact form the original version , this OMEN is cast with actors who make the story more credible because they imbue it with more humanly drawn character interpretations . Much of the power of the film lies in the superb performance by Liev Schreiber as the politically important father of a ' stillborn ' son that was ' exchanged ' at birth : he gives a warmth and honesty that were elusive in Gregory Peck's performance . Much the same can be said about Pete Postlethwaite's tormented priest who tries to alter the events threatened if the ' adopted ' strange son Damien is allowed to mature , and to David Thewlis as the photographer who helps Schreiber's character come to grips with the decision he made about child swapping on the day of the birth of Damien . Mia Farrow , cosmetically enhanced to look oddly young , is the smarmy nanny and Michael Chabon gives a bit of class to the priest with the dreaded secrets on how to end the impending destruction if Damien is allowed to live . The weak link in the cast is Julia Stiles who here just can't seem to inhabit the role of the increasingly terrified mother of Damien : likewise the child selected to portray Damien ( Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick ) appears more a makeup artist's vision rather than a child whose apparent normalcy could have made the evil within more terrifying . The special effects are used well as is a musical score by Marco Beltrami ( though not nearly as memorable as that by Jerry Goldsmith in the original ) . An interesting finding is that the original 6-year-old actor portraying Damien ( Harvey Stephens ) is cast in a tiny part here as a tabloid reporter , giving the feeling that the spirit of Damien is still pervasive . Director John Moore gets most of right . Not a bad movie as many have stated and one that certainly could have been more powerful with some casing changes , but this film still causes the jitters in an otherwise tranquil evening !

513029	3223254	410626	7.0	The Rewards and Perils of Bonded Kids Who Never Grow Up	SLINGSHOT explores the ups and downs of the lives of two boys , close friends since childhood , both from homes where they were unwanted , who made it through reform school and remain as a unit into an adult life as petty scam artists - living on the edge of crime and a life of desperate need for belonging . The script by Jay Alaimo ( who also directs ) , Matt Fiorello , Matthew Martin is gritty , full of humor and fine interchanges between the characters that manage to lift the story to a higher level of social statement than the usual ' crime buddies tales ' . Ashley ( David Arquette ) and Taylor ( Balthazar Getty ) are the borderline ' bad guy duo ' who have decided to move their scam of charming lonely housewives while robbing them to Fairfield County , Connecticut : the scam is that Taylor seduces the women while Ashley robs the preoccupied women . One of Taylor's hits is bored and married Karen ( Julianna Margulies ) whose second marriage is passionless making her an easy target for Taylor's charms . All goes according to plan until Taylor realizes he cares for Karen and Karen ( with a lot of encouragement from girlfriend Emma - Joely Fisher - for an affair ) falls for Taylor . The nightly signal from Karen that the coast is clear for Taylor to join her in bed is a light from her bedroom , yet when that goes on one evening , Taylor meets Karen's young daughter April ( Thora Birch ) in her mother's bedroom and barely escapes discovery when Karen and husband come home early . April at first mocks Taylor's attraction to her mother , but gradually the two bond - the first time that Taylor has been close to anyone except Ashley . While Taylor is ' prepping ' Karen for robbery Ashley is mixing with their ' crime bosses ' Dickson ( Michael Janik ) and Fast Bobby ( Svetlana Metkina ) and feels the threat to perform . Several incidents lead to the final confrontation between Taylor , now enamored with April , and Ashley , who finally comes to grips with the fact that he is love with Taylor . The long-standing duo hits a schism and how that resolves provides a disturbing ending . The four leads - Arquette , Getty , Margulies , and Birch - offer performances that are more than simple outlines of disconsolate characters : they inhabit their roles , finding cores of credibility that allow the viewer to understand the needs and fears of these isolated people . The cinematography by Paul Daley is appropriately grimy and the film editing by Jim Rubino takes Jay Alaimo's direction to a more cohesive whole . While not a great movie by any means , it is a touching character study of what happens to unwanted kids whose lives are dependent on each other in a world that rejects them . Grady Harp
513373	3223254	404030	7.0	Schreiber Makes Foer Visual	Jonathan Safran Foer's widely read novel ' Everything is Illuminated ' was a zany concoction of story , standup comedy , and fantasy that worked well as a diversion because of Foer's very apparent rough style of writing : everything is forgiven if the words play with the imagination . But as a film the book seemed a formidable undertaking . Liev Schreiber , a consummate actor , adapted Foer's book for the screen , performing major surgery on the tale , and then directed his version with great skill . The result is a film that always entertains but that also crosses lines between reality and fantasy , writer's intentions vs screenwriter's needs , and story manipulation that may please some and frustrate those who loved the book . Jonathan Safran Foer ( Elijah Wood ) is a collector of familial trinkets who sets out to the Ukraine to discover teasers of how his Jewish grandfather escaped annihilation in the Ukraine at the kindness of one Augustine ( Tereza Veselkova ) . Once in the Ukraine he hires a tour guide Alex ( Eugene Hutz ) who with his ' blind ' grandfather ( Boris Leskin ) as driver and their bizarre dog Sammy Davis Jr . Jr . to take him to Trachimbrod , the site where Foer's grandfather knew Augustine . It seems there is no such place , and the journey to wherever begins . Alex mangles his English with malapropisms and strange word substitutions making his job as translator for Foer the high point of the road trip ( as it made the original book the reason to read ! ) . The many entanglements the strange little group encounter in their drive results in finding the secrets Foer is seeking and he is able to return home satisfied with his journey . All this makes for an acceptable road trip comedy until Schreiber excises the bulk of the novel - the bits of history that make the eventual discovery of the truths Foer seeks more meaningful . And while the novel never lets the comedy slip off line , the screenplay switches gears and makes the story another tender yet sad holocaust tale . But despite the completed film's ending , the DVD shows the plentiful scenes not included in the film , scenes that are as over the top and barking for laughter as Foer's crazy novel . We should only be grateful that Schreiber has the sense to delete these costly production numbers , as they are indeed silly ! Eugene Hutz ( born in 1972 Yevhen Hudz in Kiev , Ukraine ) is the true find of the film . His ' acting experience ' is solely as the ' front man for Gogol Bordello , a gypsy punk band fusing supercharged folk influences with a sideshow cabaret ' . But he manages the wildly maniacal yet strangely intuitive character and lines of Alex with great finesse . He is a treasure ! The rest of the cast is strong and the splendid musical score by Paul Cantelon and the cinematography by Matthew Libatique add immeasurably to the film . Though many may disagree with Schrieber's manipulation of the book , few will be able to miss the fact that for a first outing as writer / director EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED is a fine start . Three stars for the film in general , but a fourth star for the performances by Hutz and Leskin . Grady Harp
513609	3223254	428856	7.0	Look at Me , See Me , Do I Exist ?	LA MOUSTACHE is a very well acted and conceived Belgian film that starts with a terrific premise that could be the opening for either a comedy or a drama and ends up wondering which path to take . Writer / director Emmanuel Carrère ( with co-script writer Jérôme Beaujour ) takes us on a mind trip that becomes increasingly disorienting and frustrating as the film progresses . It challenges the audience to think but then there is no payoff for the effort . Marc ( Vincent Lindon ) is a handsome middle aged man married to Agnès ( Emmanuelle Devos ) for fifteen years and one morning , in what in retrospect is in response to a bit of relationship ennui , decides to shave off his mustache which has always been present since his marriage began . The surprise to Marc is that Agnès doesn't even notice . At work Marc quietly shows up and no one notices , not even his close associate Bruno ( Hippolyte Girardot ) . Marc is at first perplexed , then he confronts his wife and fellow workers with the fact that he just shaved off his mustache and no one believes that he ever had one ! Marc begins to search for photos showing his previous face and gradually the photos disappear and his wife denies ever seeing them , ever traveling to Bali where the photos were taken , etc . People begin to wonder about Marc's sanity and his wife suggests he seek psychiatric care . It is at this point that Marc enters a fugue state and ultimately disappears to Hong Kong on a never ending quest for discovering the truth about who he really is , whether he actually exists , whether he is the pawn in a cosmic game . . . . it just gets more ludicrous . Both Vincent Lindon and Emmanuelle Devos are superb in this peculiar roles and the film has solid production values . Perhaps it is the director's point to leave the audience in a confused state , one that calls forth the existential questions , but as a film it merely peters out , leaving the viewer a bit frustrated by the lack of substance .

513168	3223254	853096	7.0	Ex Post Facto	DEATH OF A PRESIDENT is most assuredly a film that will cause boisterous anger among those who are reacting to the title . It is an ' imagined documentary ' about the assassination of President Bush on October 19 , 2007 , using this ' event ' to explore the manner in which the US government copes with such a proposed event . In ways it echoes the JFK assassination , an event that still is under scrutiny as to why it happened and who was ultimately responsible . Using actual footage of President Bush at an Economic conference in Chicago along with reporters and actors who supply the drama , the film ' shows ' the assassination and the aftermath with the subsequent frightening state of Cheney as President . But the emphasis is on how the driver of the story is placing blame , finding a perpetrator and then convincing Washington and the public why the event happened . It is terrifyingly believable . But few will see the film this way - a possibility and a series of consequences that might result . Perhaps it is better to quote the writer / director Gabriel Range who seems to sum it up best : " I have always known that I would be condemned for the very idea of this film , but I believe that sometimes it is not only acceptable for art to be outrageous - it is necessary . We live in a time of incredible fear . . . The advance condemnation of this film by politicians and pundits who have not seen - and may never see - this film reflects the landscape of fear in which we live today , and which my film attempts to address . " Enough said . Grady Harp
512966	3223254	390384	8.0	A Peek Into The Mystery of the Moment of Discovery	A strange , creative little film , this . One that manages to make visual the chaos of quantum physics in the form of human permutations of the disorder and bizarre combination of marvel and fear that confront the mind upon a moment of discovery of a new fact / concept . This is a film that should be viewed by an audience prepared to engage those parts of the brain not usually readily accessible , but available cellules of new thought chambers that need and should be challenged if we are to continue to cope with a universe increasingly less understandable the more we study it . Beginning with the title , PRIMER , no insight is presented as to whether the meaning is 1 ) introductory text : a book that provides an introduction to a topic , or 2 ) as in biochemistry : genetic material - a molecular substrate such as a DNA molecule needed in the polymerization reaction that produces another molecule structurally similar to the substrate . That is the beginning hurdle . But if the viewer stumbles on the easy bumps , then the remainder of the story will be impossible . Instead it is recommended that this film be approached with a ' tabula rasa ' and simply watch as four young men bent on inventing the next big ' thing ' fall into discovery of what appears to be a device that involves time travel , both horizontal and vertical . The characters ( Shane Carruth , David Sullivan , Casey Gooden , and Anand Upadhyaya ) resemble talking heads and it is the dissolution of this quartet into a duet that supplies the human-interest aspect of this science experiment . First , discovery , then analytical permutations , and ultimately greed and the accompanying human foibles that are sparked by the new . This is very obviously a low budget work of love by writer / director / actor / cinematographer / producer / musical scorer / editor Shane Carruth ( yes , he does it all ) with all of the other tasks being accomplished by the remaining members of the cast . The idea of the film is good and the fellows pull it off well . If the dialogue becomes annoyingly verbose and abstract and covered by a rather pompous voice-over commentator , just rest assured that much of it isn't decipherable because of the quality of the sound and the fact that everyone talks simultaneously . And if at the end of the film you are left scratching your head as to what you have just seen , then try to quickly summarize quantum physics or the chaos theory or even something as simple as molecular biology ! It is not meant to be simple , it is meant to approximate the terror and joy of confrontation with the frontiers of science and examine how inventions dealing with the chaos theory are inexorably linked with human frailties . At a budget of $7 , 000 . this film relies more of personal commitment on the part of the crew than on the need to create a blockbuster movie . Exercise your mind - try it . Grady Harp
513624	3223254	466816	8.0	Stalking Life	MISTER FOE ( aka HALLAM FOE ) is another dark film about buried pain and insecurities , much like director David Mackenzie's YOUNG ADAM . Mackenzie is also responsible for the crackling screenplay adapted from the novel by Peter Jinks , the story of a young lad named Hallam ( Jamie Bell ) damaged by his mother's death / ? suicide to the point where he separates himself from the world by living in a tree house , observing his father ( Ciarán Hinds ) in his too rapid replacement of Hallam's mother with the dangerous Verity ( Claire Forlani ) . A bizarre 17-year-old , Hallam attacks his fears and the world dressed in a manner of beast like costumes , all to assuage his grief for his mother's death . When Verity's behavior drives Hallam from his elegant home , he retreats to Edinburgh , becoming a boy of the streets . One day he spies a woman named Kate ( Sophia Myles ) who greatly resembles his dead mother and he begins stalking her , spying on her in every conceivable way until he convinces her to hire him in her hotel as a kitchen porter . Proximity feeds obsession and Hallam discovers that Kate is having an affair with a married hotel executive , the result of which is a clash with reality , and Hallam must confront his Oedipal desires with his coming to grips with the reality of his grief for this deceased mother . The discovery he makes with Kate transfers to his relationship with his own family and opens doors for growth rather than maintaining his jail - like mental anguish . The story is bizarre and very dark at times , but the performance by Jamie Bell , well accompanied by those of Hinds , Forlani , Myles et al , make this tale of coming of age fascinating . The art direction ( Caroline Grebbell ) , cinematography ( Giles Nuttgens ) and musical score ( as concocted by Matt Biffa from performers such as Future Pilot A . K . A . ) enhance the production - maintaining the high standards set by Mackenzie . Hallam is a lad we grow to love despite his kooky behavior : few other actors could inhabit this role with the élan of the considerably talented Jamie Bell . Recommended . Grady Harp
513371	3223254	338097	8.0	World War II from the European View	Writer and Director John Duigan has added to his cinematic stature with this recent film about the interrelated responses of three countries - England , France , Spain - to the early phases of WW II and in doing so gives some inadvertent insight into how the continent was so endangered by the little known bad boy Hitler in the years leading up to the horror of a second World War . The title seems very appropriate - taken from the quip of ' Head in the clouds , Feet on the ground ' - as the lead character Gilda ( a radiantly beautiful Charlize Theron ) seems to float above all of the reality of warring struggles in 1933 , focusing her life on paramours , expensive clothes , and ' dangerous liaisons ' with a varied assortment of men , all the while keeping a firm stance on needs of her strangely disjointed life . Indeed , the opening of the film finds Gilda in need of shelter from a night's fling with a Cambridge lover and she knocks on the door of a poor struggling Irish student Guy ( Stuart Townsend ) , thus beginning a lasting affair that coasts through the entire story . Guy eventually follows Gilda to Paris where she is a popular photographer living with her gallerist , but also living with her lesbian lover Mia ( Penelope Cruz ) . Gilda , Guy , and Mia become a triptych and it is only the impact of the rise of fascism in Spain ( Mia's home ) that separates the ménage a trois : idealistic Guy and compassionate Mia are off to fight Franco while Gilda is left behind to admit to the encroaching threat of Nazis in France and enter into her own version of involvement . How these three weather the war and resolve their varied degrees of complicity provides the film's finale . The cast is strong , the settings are gorgeous ( in all three countries ) as captured by cinematographer Paul Sarossy , and the musical score by Terry Frewer introduces a potential talent for film composition ( while borrowing heavily from French cabaret songs , symphonic music by Edward Elgar , and pieces of Francis Poulenc ) . But the overall reason for enjoying this rather long film is the interplay of Theron , Townsend and Cruz in a variety of richly sensuous vignettes . Well worth watching . Grady Harp
513440	3223254	380817	8.0	Inside the Box	Though the cover for the DVD of WINTER PASSING ( a photo of the four main characters crowded into a box ) may make many potential viewers pass over this little film , thinking that it must be silly slapstick , this is a fine film written and directed with finesse and style by Adam Rapp , a new face whose talents have been somewhat limited to working on episodes of the TV series ' The L Word ' . Rapp gives notice of a fine writer and an equally fine director in this barely noticed little touching movie . Reese Holdin ( Zooey Deschanel ) lives in New York , an actress relegated to small parts in off Broadway theater while spending her days as a bartender hooked on alcohol , drugs and casual sex . Her life seems dead-ended : she has become anesthetized by her manner of living . An agent ( Amy Madigan ) approaches her with an offer to pay her for the letters between her parents , both once famous authors . Her mother has just died , and Reese didn't attend her funeral , so distant does she feel is her relationship to her past . But the spark of money moves her to ride a bus back to her Michigan home to salvage the letters to sell for publication . Arriving home she is greeted by the weird Corbit ( Will Ferrell ) , a Christian electric guitar player and composer who ears black eyeliner etc , but does care for Reese's severely alcoholic father - the once famous writer Don Holdin ( Ed Harris ) who hasn't written a novel in years and lives in the garage of his home under the care of Corbit and an ex-student Shelley ( Amelia Warner ) , a bright very young girl with demons of her own . Reese works at reconnecting with her father , struggles with her resentment for the ' caregivers ' , and ultimately finds the letters she came for , only to make discoveries about her dysfunctional family and her father's status that alters her view of his value as her parent . The movie is rather stagy and most of the action is unspoken , and while that technique of telling this particular story seems exactly right to this viewer , there are some who will feel frustrated at the rather static pace of the film . Zooey Deschanel once again proves that she is one of our finest actresses on the screen and hopefully this role will bring her to the attention of casting agents and result in our seeing more of this gifted actress in the future . Ed Harris is superb as the wasted , quietly grieving has-been author , keeping his performance understated and in doing so creating a character that is indelible in our minds long after the movie is over . Amelia Warner is also a fine little actress and even galumphing Will Ferrell brings more than his usual tiring comedic talents to this touching role . In all this is a movie that deserves wide attention . There is more to quietly hear and understand about interpersonal relationships than we would expect from the cover ! Grady Harp
513098	3223254	455584	8.0	A Taut Thriller That Keeps Circling the Viewer's Mind Through a Maze	THE KOVAK BOX is a successful little suspense / psychological thriller from the Spanish writers Daniel Monzón ( who also directs ) and Jorge Guerricaechevarría . The story may be a bit far fetched , but then what horror story isn't ? The premise for the tale holds up well and is aided by some very fine performances by a mixture of Spanish , English , and American actors . The mood of the film is beautifully set during opening credits by a complex maze in which a white rat sniffs and ambulates from confusing corner to confusing wall - just the manner in which director Monzón plans to tell his story . David Norton ( Timothy Hutton ) is a celebrated science fiction novelist visiting Majorca for a special conference accompanied by his soon to be fiancée Jane ( Georgia Mackenzie ) . David has been having premonitions on his flight to the conference and those brooding thoughts continue as he registers for the conference and finds little disturbing clues that culminate in Jane's suicide leap from their hotel balcony . Almost simultaneously an attractive Spanish girl Silvia ( Lucía Jiménez ) in the same hotel ' jumps ' from her balcony but is saved from death by falling onto an awning . Jane dies in the hospital : Silvia is in the bed next to Jane , witnesses David's grief , and the beginning of a bond is created . David meets a strange old man Frank Kovak ( David Kelly ) who seeks an autograph of David's first novel ' Gloomy Sunday ' and from there the mystery begins . David becomes the unknowing main character in a sci-fi story that mimics ideas from his own first book , a story about the implantation of devices in humans that would enable a central force to assist the victims in their own destructive ends . The plot is tightly woven from this point on and to reveal any portion of it would diminish the chair-gripping finale . Timothy Hutton seems an odd choice for the main character of the film until his combination of cool intellect and understated passion clicks in . The film is graced by the presence of the talented Lucía Jiménez who seems to have the potential of becoming another Penelope Cruz ! The cinematography by Carles Gusi and musical score by Roque Baños make the setting visually and aurally spectacular . For those who enjoy mind bender thrillers , THE KOVAK BOX will certainly please . Grady Harp
512814	3223254	386092	8.0	A Love Story and the Conflicts of Sexuality	AMOUR DE FEMME is a well-produced film that deals with the trials and agonies facing women who come out as lesbians . It is quiet , subtle , beautifully photographed , and is fortunate to have a fine , handsome cast directed with sensitivity by Sylvie Verheyde who also wrote the simple but elegant screenplay . Made in 2001 AMOUR DE FEMME came to the screen before the popular US television series THE L WORD , a program that has provided a healthier look at same sex relationships between women , and though there have been successful mainstream lesbian films , this particular one avoids some of the pitfalls that have prevented wide public acceptance of the others . The writer / director does not surround her two main characters with the usual bar scenes and peripheral characters that can distract from the story of a sexual discovery , but instead keeps the story tight with a small cast each of whom makes an impact on the story . Jeanne ( Hélène Fillières ) is a successful osteopath / wife / mother who happens to reluctantly accompany her handsome husband David ( Anthony Delon ) to a birthday party for his best friend Franck ( Jeannick Gravelines ) and there she encounters Marie ( Raffaëla Anderson ) , a dancer , and a chemistry develops resulting in an evening Jeanne enjoys very much . Slowly Jeanne and Marie begin meeting very openly , Jeanne is honest with David about her comings and goings , but when the two women's relationship becomes physical , Jeanne is faced with decisions about her sexuality . David confronts Jeanne about Marie , Jeanne confides her shaky mental and physical state , and when David eventually confronts Jeanne in a telling way , Jeanne understands her true self and despite her deep love for her small child , realizes she must follow her heart . The cinematography both in Paris and in Normandy , where Jeanne and Marie with Marie's younger brother Moïse ( Thierno Sy ) have spent refreshing moments together , is stunning . Both of the actresses are not only beautiful but also talented and yield a credible attraction and passion . The entire cast is superb . The one distracting element in the film is the sound track : there is a rumbling pedal point noise that accompanies almost every scene between Jeanne and Marie and is annoyingly distracting . In French with English subtitles . The DVD is very fine in execution , but there are not extras except for some video trailers . A comment from the talented writer / director would have enhanced the release . Recommended . Grady Harp , March 06
513431	3223254	409034	8.0	Dancing as a Way out of Loss	Whatever the impetus for writer / director Randall Miller to recreate his 1990 film on the same subject , this little low budget film has the sense of commitment and love on the part of everyone associated with it . Be warned that this is a hankie film and that if you don't have a tolerance ( or a fondness ) for tearjerkers , then best avoid this one . But for those who enjoy a look at the changes that loss and discovery and love can impact a disparate group of characters ' lives , this is a sweet little movie . The basic premise is how caring for others can positively affect one's own world view . Frank Keane ( Robert Carlyle ) is a baker in a family shop , a quiet man who is trying to recover from his wife's unexplained suicide and for consolation he is in group therapy with other grieving men ( David Paymer is the leader of a group that includes Sean Astin , Adam Arkin , Ernie Hudson , Miguel Sandoval ) . On a routine delivery run , Frank witness a car crash in which Steve Mills ( John Goodman ) is critically injured . Feeling helpless , Frank calls the paramedics who respond and tell him to keep Steve talking . And talk Steve does , pleading with Frank to go to a ballroom dance session to which he promised a young girl he would attend 40 years ago when a child . Frank does attend Marilyn Hotchkiss ( Patricia Fraser ) Ballroom Dancing and Charm School , feels out of place at first , but gradually warms to the message of now-owner Marienne Hotchkiss ( Mary Steenburgen ) , meets an abused Meredith ( Marisa Tomei ) , her abuser Randall Ipswich ( Donnie Wahlberg ) , and fellow dancers including Sonja Braga et al . Through the miracle of dance ( and through a lot of flashbacks from car accident to Steve's childhood , etc ) conflicts resolve . The ending is cluttered by events unnecessary to the story but seemingly inserted to make use of the talents of Danny DeVito and Camryn Manheim . But by the time this fluff is added we have already been enchanted with the bumpy road tale and can forgive about anything . This little unpretentious movie has an endearing style and is populated with some superb actors who seem committed to the project . Many of the ' little things ' ( Hotchkiss ' gradual variation in costume , the DJ " Freeway " ( uncredited ) , and the quality of outside vs interior photography ) come to mind in retrospect and make the memory of this evening of borderline saccharine story even more of a treasure .

512832	3223254	419887	8.0	The Kites of the Novel are Uplifted by the Wind but Fail to Soar in the Film	Khaled Hosseini's THE KITE RUNNER was one of those first novels that captured both public interest and the hearts of the many who read this story of childhood unconditional love and redemption set against three stormy decades in Afghanistan . Though Hosseini was approached about the story's adaptation to the screen soon after the novel was published , there seems to have been a rush to get the visual form of the poetic novel before the audience , a journey besieged by unsuspected political intervention and criticism by the Afghan government . But after seeing the film , this intrigue heightens the intent of those involved in translating the book to film - writer David Benioff and director Marc Forster . People may argue both sides of whether or not the dialog be in Afghan languages ( Dari , Pashtu , Urdu ) with English subtitles or be in English throughout : the choice of using both languages is severely hampered by the decision to place the Afghan translations in an overlay on the screen while the English subtitles are place off the viewing field . A small point , perhaps , but one that makes the first viewing of the film difficult to follow visually . As far as the actors are concerned , the two young lads who were chosen to portray Amir ( Zekeria Ebrahimi ) and Hassan ( Ahmad Khan Mahmidzada ) are perfect : closest of friends living in a household where one ( Amir ) is the son of the master of the house and the other ( Hassan ) is the son of the grounds and house keeper - a factor that serves to underline class differences that will later become increasingly poignant . The boys are inseparable , reading stories together and flying kites in competitions - each lad specializing in one of those pastimes . But disaster crumbles the boys ' victory in the kite flying contest when Hassan is beaten and raped by the town bullies while Amir cowardly runs for safety , deserting his friend . Suddenly the Russians invade and that change factors into the need for Amir and his father to move to America where Amir is educated and becomes a writer . Twenty years pass . After the fall of Afghanistan to the Russians and subsequently to the Taliban , Amir ( now actor Khalid Abdalla ) receives a telephone plea from Hassan's father to return to Kabul . Amir , now married and a successful writer , feels the need to return to amend for his past omission as well as to assuage Amir's fears . When he arrives in Kabul he encounters a war torn country he no longer recognizes , discovers past secrets as to his and Hassan's true identities , and sets out on a journey to bring closure to a childhood love and promise . It is a touching tale of redemption and the strongest echo of the magic of the novel . THE KITE RUNNER as both novel and film will appeal to all audiences sensitive to scars that wars leave on children and adults alike . For this viewer the film lacks the intensity of the book in that the time spent with the childhood of the two boys feels secondary to the personal journey of the adult Amir . But that is not to say the film is less powerful in the end : the story is one that leaves an imprint on the audience that last long past the ending credits . Grady Harp
513509	3223254	804461	8.0	Revenge and other forms of Madness	DEATH SENTENCE is a tough movie to watch , not because it is a poorly made film , but because of the degree of violence that , once started , is mayhem on a roller coaster ride . Though based on a novel by Brian Garfield , the script by Ian Jeffers is a patchwork quilt - the holes show whenever the police arrive on the scene . James Wan , of the ' Saw ' movies fame , directs with a keen eye for breathless action sequences and almost intolerable suspense timing that makes the film fly through the 111 minutes of the Unrated version . During the opening credits we are introduced to the perfect family via home movies and domestic scenes : Nick Hume ( Kevin Bacon ) is the devoted father , Helen ( Kelly Preston ) his bright and loving wife , Brendan ( Stuart Lafferty ) is the golden boy son with all the soccer laurels , and Lucas ( Jordan Garrett ) the younger ' also ran ' son . The glitch in this family's happiness happens one night when , out of gas while driving home from a soccer game , Nick stops at a gas station and while Brendan is in the convenience store a gang comes in and murders the store owner and Brendan : the reason for the killing is not robbery but an initiation rite into a gang accomplished by young Joe Darley ( Matt O'Leary ) and the demand of his older brother Billy ( Garrett Hedlund , in a very out of character role from his usual ' Troy ' , ' Friday Night Lights ' , ' Eragon ' , ' Georgia Rule ' persona ) . Nick witnesses the killing and when the lawyers and police work with him in the aftermath to ' arrange a deal ' instead of a murder trial , Nick decides to take matters in hi s own hands . The Darley brothers are part of a ruthless gang sponsored by their own father Bones Darley ( John Goodman , in a very dark and well-realized role ) . Nick stalks Joe Darley and murders him , and once the deed ( that happens to begin a gang war against Nick ) is done the terror begins . The gang is out to kill not only Nick but Nick's family also . How this pursued and pursuers game works out furnishes the remainder of the film . It is the old eye for an eye story that ends in tragedy for everyone concerned . When the film is dealing with the ' family ' and the ' gang ' the dialog sparkles , but when the police , headed by Detective Wallis ( Aisha Tyler ) , become involved the aid from the police becomes as ludicrous as the dialog placed in their mouths . Kevin Bacon gives a bravura performance as the gentle father driven to murderous madness and Garrett Hedlund matches him as the ruthless and terrifying gang leader Billy . There are enough sidebars about father / son relationships on both sides of the plot line to make the movie have a message . But in the end it is the wildly frantic camera action and directorial decisions by Wan that make this a horrifying and arresting film . Not for the queasy viewer . Grady Harp
512701	3223254	396818	8.0	The Dark Corners of Love and Obsession	Writer / director Matteo Garrone has created in PRIMO AMORE yet another atmospheric film ( not unlike ' L'Imbalsamatore ' ) that deftly explores the dark side of human interactions and motivations . His style is Gothic in nature but with a contemporary setting manipulated with quirky camera work and artistically designed sets that give the viewer the feeling of watching an experiment in a laboratory , the characters all being bounded by cage-like visual devices . Yes , this is film noir , but Garrone develops his bizarre characters so well that we grow along with their transformations into the icons they become . Vittorio ( Vitaliano Trevisan ) is a goldsmith who exists on the modest , long-held family business of creating jewelry from molten gold in the ancient manner . We first meet him looking through the grid of a train station where he awaits Sonia ( Michela Cescon ) , a young girl who has answered his classified ad for a date . They meet , Sonia is pleased , but Vittorio tells her right away that he expected her to be thinner . Sonia offers to return to her home out of town , a garden home she shares with her robust brother ( Roberto Comacchio ) , but Vittorio decides he wants to try the date . They have a little courtship and all seems to go well until Vittorio begins to suggest that Sonia lose weight . They move into a nice home ( ' the site of Romeo and Juliet ' the realtor boasts ) and their coexistence begins . Vittorio is confronted with the needs of his business expanding stimulated by an offer to partner his business from an entrepreneur who insists Vittorio make only heavy bracelets and substantial jewelry in response to what the public is buying : Vittorio has always preferred the tiny , thin , light weight delicate carvings of beauty rather than the bulkier profitable items . The decision causes Vittorio's two old workers to leave him and Vittorio is depressed . As Sonia complies with Vittorio's ongoing obsession for her to be thin , Sonia's friends and brother tell her to beware of the strange demands of Vittorio , and despite Sonia's hunger for food , her hunger for being loved is greater and she slowly moves toward anorexia . Eventually in the solitary confinement of their home the two come into conflict and the result is a tragedy few would see coming . The layers of meaning are deep : Vittorio's passion for the thin , delicate gold objects he creates as being things of true beauty are mirrored by his obsession for Sonia to be like those objects . Sonia works as a model for an art school and as she watches the students ' works alter her once nubile body to a dwindling form , she feels terrified that she will waste away . Yet her need to not be rejected by Vittorio keeps her starving her body rather than her heart . Throughout this downward spiral of physical vs emotional attraction Garrone frames the scenes in increasingly complex grids , confining the story every more tightly until the ultimate rupture . The acting is excellent and the combination of scene design and cinematography make this a dark but intensely interesting film experiment . It may not be a movie for everyone , but for those who appreciate avante garde stories and cinematic treatment , this is a film to study . Grady Harp
513109	3223254	427944	8.0	' In the end you have to pay the mortgage '	The fact that everyone ( well , almost ) will do anything for money - the mortgage must be paid - is only one of the subversive elements placed on the table of this bitingly satirical film . Based on the very edgy novel by Christopher Buckley , director Jason Reitman has adapted the story for the screen , populated his diatribe with a fine cast of actors , and directs the whole concept with deft precision . While many not familiar with the book's bite will be put off by the title , rest assured that no one escapes this exploration of the tobacco industry , the health industry , and the political industry unscathed . Aaron Eckhart is spot on as the tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor , a man of style and spin who can talk his way through any confrontational encounter and come out the winner . He is supported by the tobacco kings Budd ' BR ' Rohrbacher ( J . K . Simmons ) and ' The Captain ' ( Robert Duvall ) , the movie mogul Jeff Megall ( Rob Lowe ) , by his buddies in crime Maria Bello and David Koechner with similar lobbyist roles in alcohol and firearms , and confronted by Senator Finistirre ( William H . Macy in another jewel of a role ) , ex-Marlboro Man Lorne Lutch ( Sam Elliott ) , and journalist Heather Holloway ( Katie Holmes ) . How he manages to make all of these folk satisfied with his message comprises the bulk of this flimflam man story , a tale that butchers the tobacco industry with the same vehemence as the anti-smoking brigade . The lines are fast and furious and Eckhart is superb in his role . Somehow the emphasis of the relationship and frothy philosophy sessions between Eckhart and his son ( Cameron Bright - as monochromatic a child actor as there is in the industry today ) make the movie fairly boring just when is should be picking up momentum , but that is Hollywood covering its tracks . Not a great movie , but a movie that is much better than you would expect ! Grady Harp
513558	3223254	414510	8.0	And then there were two . . . Mind Games in the Woods of Canada	Cassandra Nicolaou is a writer and director with a talent for exploring the inner lives of her characters . Much of what she creates is on the surface : an equal part lies beneath the facade and reveals personal histories through the looks in eyes and the silences she encourages form her actors . Affluent mid-thirties Sarah ( the very fine Michelle Nolden ) is off from the city for a rendezvous with her lover Sam , complete with special grocery shopping and wine cases to supply them for a little getaway in their isolated mountain cabin in the woods . But when traffic snarls slows her luxury vehicle to a stop and her temper is frayed , two street kids approach , pull the squeegee scam and when rejected by Sarah , they sulk on the sidewalk and Sarah , remorseful for her behavior to them , offers them money . They accept the money and jump into the car , brandishing weapons , and treat Sarah like a hostage , instructing her to drive them out of the city . Desperate but cool , Sarah receives a cellphone call from Sam , indicating the remote cabin meeting - and the atmosphere changes . Now the girl , Jenna ( the beautiful and talented Katharine Isabelle ) and the boy , Jackson ( Kett Turton , another fine young actor ) are in complete control , and the three head to the cabin . Once in the picturesque cabin by a lake Jenna and Jackson tie Sarah to a chair and go about trying to find all possible cash and goods to steal from Sarah . The ' kidnapping ' gradually unveils secrets on the part of all three and slowly the trio , isolated and after attempted escapes by Sarah , begin to bond . The events then fall pall mall , video tapes of Sarah's private life reveal an aspect Jenna never suspected yet longs to understand and experience , Sarah and Jackson play a cat and mouse game that includes a degree of intimacy , an ' intruder ' appears with dire consequences , and the film tumbles to a painful ending for each of the trio ( now duo ) . The film begins and ends with a voice over stating ' There are two kinds of people in the world : those who need to be rescued , and those who want to rescue . ' And the plot in retrospect examines that statement thoroughly . Writer / director Nicolaou has the integrity to incorporate gender identities , childhood needs and adoption policies , and the differences in reference points between those with money and those on the street in subtle ways , careful to not make judgments but to only reveal similarities . The cast is very good and if the script is a bit repetitive in phrases over used , that is the way young people communicate and to script it otherwise would make the dialogue false . This is a fine little thriller , more for the mind but also for the physical violence aficionados . For this viewer , this is an underrated movie .
512679	3223254	398963	8.0	A Smart , Snappy , Sensitive Coming Out Movie	Writer / director / producer Tennyson Bardwell is definitely a talent to watch . In his first venture into film , DORIAN BLUES , he has created an intelligent script with razor sharp dialogue , witty and acerbic and touching depending on the moment , and has cast his film with a fine groups of actors who obviously hold him in great respect , as the final product is a polished film that is always entertaining as well as informative . Few ' coming out ' films flesh out the territory as succinctly and realistically as this . Dorian Lagatos ( a fresh and talented Michael McMillian ) is sour on the world that doesn't understand him . His family is the microscope on his world : a right wing radical father Tom ( Charles Fletcher ) , a seemingly ditsy but subservient mother Maria ( Mo Quigley ) , and a brother Nicky ( another bright and hunky talent Lea Coco ) who is everything Dorian isn't - a jock , a ladies ' man , and a happy-go-lucky high schooler . Dorian has an ' epiphany ' : he discovers the reason he doesn't fit in is that he is gay ! With his discovery he finds some solace from another edgy gay friend Spooky ( Austin Basis ) but still feels he must remain in the closet . Finally he confides in Nicky who surprisingly listens to him and accepts him - just so long as Dorian doesn't act out . Frustrated , Dorian leaves for New York for college while Nicky wins a sports scholarship to another college . In New York Dorian finds the gay life , feels ' normal ' at last , falls in love , confronts rejection and the games people play , and then lives a despondent life until Nicky visits him : Nicky has lost his scholarship . The two brothers make the rounds of Dorian's milieu until they receive a phone call that their father has died . Returning home Dorian must still face his anger at his father , though dead , and it is this anger that his mother ( far more sensitive than Dorian ever knew ) confronts Dorian and the message of the movie is completed in a very realistic and understanding way . Life's philosophy is not wholly bound to one's sexual preferences . Michael McMillian and Lea Coco both give notice of being young gifted actors to watch . And the apparently ' film inexperienced ' Charles Fletcher and Mo Quigley deliver radiant cameo roles . Indeed the entire supporting cast is excellent , perhaps due to the fact the Bardwell is a fine director ! This is a gay coming out film that is intelligent , free of the usual visuals that distract the general audience , and one that has more healthy bits of psychology scattered throughout than many a feature film . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
512738	3223254	434124	8.0	Light , Pleasant Entertainment , but the Message is Getting Tired	KINKY BOOTS has a lot of positive things going for it - a cast that is committed , a pace that is fluid , the presence of some fun song and dance sequences , and a lot of sight gags and moments of introspection and awakening . The problem is that , for all the sweet ideas the film explores , the story has been repeatedly done : small town folk facing job loss and identity crises turn things ' round to have a jolly ending ( Calendar Girls , Billy Elliot , Waking Ned Devine , The Full Monty , etc ) . But this film works on many levels and is definitely worth an evening's entertainment . Charley Price ( Joel Edgerton ) has been groomed since childhood to take over the Price Shoe Factory in Northampton yet when he finishes schooling he is off to London to lead his own life when suddenly his father dies and the shoe factory is doomed unless he returns . Finding the production of men's brogues in disarray ( he is on the dangerous edge of bankruptcy ) he begins letting the long-term employees go until one of the spunkier ones Lauren ( Sarah-Jane Potts ) reprimands him into thinking about finding new avenues for the factory's future . A tip to London and to a nightclub with Drag Queens sparks the idea of creating high heeled boots that can support a man's weight : the new market will be drag queens . One star drag queen is Lola / Simon ( Chiwetel Ejiofor ) is brought to the factory , startles the workers with her style , but comes up with a design for kinky boots that eventually the factory successfully makes and enters into the fashion line at Milan : the factory - and the people who work there - is saved and minds are broadened and changed . The story is at its best when it involves the numerous drag numbers by Chiwetel Ejiofor who is clearly the star of this film . He is a compassionate person , plays his role with fire and spice and vulnerability and steels every scene he is in . The remainder of the cast ( including the very reliable Linda Bassett - Oscar and Lucinda , The Hours , Calendar Girls , Separate Lies , etc - , Nick Frost , Stephen Marcus , and others ) is superb . So for a storyline idea a bit stale ( even though it is based on a true tale ) , the movie works : it is an ensemble creation .
512804	3223254	360130	8.0	A Promising Tale Meanders into the Director's Indulgences	UNDERTOW is a perplexing film , one that seems like it could be a superb atmospheric contemplation of poverty and its consequences in the back roads of the South , but ends in a prolonged ennui that suggests that a growing director doesn't know when excess has been met and indulged . John Munn ( Dermot Mulroney ) lives with his two sons Chris ( Jamie Bell ) and Tim ( Devon Alan ) in mud and squalor in rural Georgia , a place of escape from inquisitive society after the death of his wife . Chris is lonely and curious and is repeatedly arrested for minor crimes while Tim is psychically injured and lives in an unhealthy mental state eating paint , mud , and anything that will make him vomit . John Munn tries valiantly to cope with being a single father of these two problematic boys but clearly needs help . Into this setting arrives Deel , John's ne're-do-well brother with whom he had a rocky childhood who has been recently released form prison for a crime that apparently tangentially involved John . John takes Deel in to provide shelter in exchange for helping him with his pig farm and with his boys , but we soon discover that Deel's true motivation for visiting his long-lost brother is to gain access to gold coins given to John and Deel by their father ( references to the use of gold coins to pay Charon for passage over the river Styx into Hades and the subsequent curse on these coins is explained by John to his boys ) . The crisis of the movie is the conflict and ultimately deadly encounter between Deel and John and when the boys observe the loss of their father , they gather the coins and a backpack and begin their flight to safety . The remainder of the movie is how these two brothers learn to grow up and fend for themselves in the most difficult of circumstances and always under the threat of Deel's discovering their whereabouts . Along the way we meet some interesting if repetitively impoverished folk , each adding a bit of philosophy , both said and unsaid , to the boys ' growth . The ending is Grand Guignol and to reveal it further would be a disservice to the surprise it holds . David Gordon Green is a 30-year-old director who has a penchant for tales of the impoverished South . He understands mood and atmosphere , makes use of freeze frame camera angles poignantly and is able to draw unfettered realistic performances from his actors ( both main characters and bit players ) . He wisely elected to enlist the fine cinematography of Tim Orr , the quasi-appropriate musical score by Phillip Glass , and tries to work with a shaky dialogue by screenwriter Joe Conway based on a story by Lingard Jervey . At this point in his career ( and yes , he is the assigned director for the upcoming ' The Secret Life of Bees ' ) he is a creative artist who needs to watch his own completed films carefully to see where he loses control of the story and allows it to disappear in the mists of bland blathering . There is so much good in his work that surely the services of a brave , outspoken editor will repair his indulgences . The four main actors are all excellent : Mulroney and Lucas have an unkempt , of-the-dirt sensuality that keeps them constantly engaging and each develops a fully realized character from the material they are given . Jamie Bell proves that he can take on tough roles and make them appear naturally simple and Devon Alan is a sensitive purveyor of a damaged boy . If there were just some way to condense this two-hour film down to tolerable proportions , this would be a truly fine film . Be patient with it and you will be observing the work of a director who will probably become an important voice . Grady Harp
513334	3223254	384488	8.0	Every little movement has a meaning all its own . . . .	SAINT RALPH is a little jewel of a film . Stories about kids who gain faith through acts of courage are usually tainted with saccharine scripts , but with the wise use of presenting a well-rounded , multidimensional character as the hero of this story , writer / director Michael McGowan succeeds in a touching tale that is so based on real behavioral patterns of young teens that it becomes simply an inspiring and entertaining movie . Ralph ( Adam Butcher ) is 14 , his father died a war hero , and his mother is hospitalized for a terminal illness . Ralph is in Catholic School run by the stern disciplinarian Father Fitzpatrick ( Gordon Pinsent ) who , understanding that Ralph has a free spirit and a propensity for getting into trouble , spies on him . Ralph is repeatedly ' punished ' for his transgressions , but when he inadvertently has a hilarious swimming pool / voyeuristic experience , he is threatened with expulsion unless he joins the school's Cross Country team run by the kindly Father Hibbert ( Campbell Scott ) . Ralph's ' naughty nature ' is balanced by his complete devotion to his hospitalized mother ( Shauna MacDonald ) whom he visits daily : she is all he has . His mother's nurse ( Jennifer Tilly ) is compassionate and shares with Ralph that as his mother slips into coma that the only thing that will save her is a miracle . Simultaneously Ralph's coach ( Father Hibbert ) jests that the only way any of the team would win the Boston Marathon would be a miracle . The dots connect ; Ralph trains , and through faith and commitment finds himself crossing the finish line of the Marathon ! The manner in which McGowan ends the story is part of what makes this film unique . Just as he allows Ralph to be a testy kid who continues to have hilarious episodes right up to the end of the story , he doesn't let the film end in bathos . He makes every action and deed that occur in Ralph's journey combine to drive toward the final meaning . So here is a gentle comedy with a heart , one that is touching while it is a little racy , full of faith while it tests rationality . The cast is superb and seem committed under McGowan's wise direction to find just the right level of realism , making us root strongly for a kid with impossible challenges . Recommended . Grady Harp
512927	3223254	437171	8.0	A Classy New Coming Out Film with Emphasis on the East LA Community	Fresh young talent and a healthy dollop of enthusiasm serve as the springboard of this well written ( Carlos Portugal and Charo Toledo ) , well directed ( Carlos Portugal ) and well acted exuberant story of those once perceived tightly closet doors of the East Los Angeles Hispanic community . Not that this is the first film to engage the topic of being gay in East LA - QUINCEAÑERA is another superb film on the subject - but it addresses so many other aspects of family and social life happening now that it deserves a wide audience . With a cast of newcomers coupled with some very fine veterans of the screen EAST SIDE STORY comes to life in a highly entertaining fashion . Closeted schooled chef Diego Campos ( a fine debut by René Alvarado ) works as a waiter in his grandmother Sara's ( elegant Irene DeBari ) little Mexican restaurant where grumpy homophobic chef Don Rogelio ( Luis Accinelli ) presides in the kitchen . Diego dreams of opening his own restaurant but family ties keep him grounded . Diego's campy Aunt Bianca ( Gladise Jimenez ) returns from Monaco on one of her many expensive sojourns to find a man and changes begin to happen . Diego's equally closeted boyfriend Pablo Morales ( David Berón ) has been refusing to settle down in a relationship with Diego , claiming that the union is a ' passing fancy ' . When Bianca enters , Pablo's attentions turn to the sexy lady and Diego is brokenhearted . Into this mélange enters a white gay couple who buy a ' flip ' house across the street , a signal to the neighborhood that gentrification is just around the corner . The couple - Wesley ( Steve Callahan ) and Jonathan ( Cory Schneider ) - meet the morose Diego and a match strikes between Diego and Wesley . Jonathan is assigned all the lines having to do with prejudice and is the one who wants out of the neighborhood as soon as their house is enhanced and their gay friends begin to visit . The white couple move apart and Wesley and Diego begin a courtship dance that is encouraged by Diego's family . How Diego handles his loss of Pablo to his Aunt Bianca and copes with the possibility of being open with Wesley forms the story line . It is all the hilarious and not so hilarious sidebars that share the space of the ' outing ' that make the film so personal and successful . Carlos Portugal is clearly a talent to watch , as are his attractive and talented cast members . EAST SIDE STORY is a fine companion piece to QUINCEAÑERA and should enjoy the same degree of popularity for all the same reasons ! Grady Harp
513252	3223254	372122	8.0	A Very Mixed Bag	ADAM AND STEVE is a movie you want to succeed : the idea of an honest gay relationship developing between two guys with a weird history and subsequent difficulties forming meaningful intimacy , the presence of four fine actors , and a film that seems to take itself not too seriously . The problem is that writer / director / star Craig Chester just seems to have put too much into his bag for one film and in doing so he diluted the strength it could have had . Adam ( Craig Chester ) first met Steve ( Malcolm Gets ) in a dance bar in 1987 where Adam ( accompanied by his grossly obese friend Rhonda - Parker Posey in a fat suit ) is dazzled by Steve's good looks and on a bet from Rhonda ends up on the date from hell : after snorting coke cut with baby laxative the two men become amorous with some rather embarrassing consequences . 17 years later Adam is a bird watcher guide while his friend Rhonda , now without a single pound of fat , is a sadly unsuccessful stand up comic . Adam inadvertently injures his beloved dog and in trying to get help at a human hospital encounters psychiatrist Steve and the two begin a courtship . Neither man is able to cope with the idea of monogamous intimacy yet they develop a solid relationship , despite visits with dysfunctional families ( Adam's Jewish family are ridiculously accident prone while Steve's Texas redneck parents are coldly homophobic ) . Steve has a straight roommate Michael ( Chris Kattan ) who plays into Steve's life the way Rhonda plays into Adam's life . Eventually memory recovers the past , it is dealt with and the ending is very predictable - as well as bit sappy . Each of the main characters does a fine job with their respective roles . It is the sidebar diversions that mess up the storyline rather than enhancing it . Yes , much of the nonsense can be forgiven because the film's heart is in the right place , but why this talented group could not have inserted a little restraint here and there is a frustrating question with which we are left . It is an entertaining film that errs on over the top asides to the point of distraction .
513092	3223254	401997	8.0	A Strong Character Driven Drama Revealing the Underbelly of our National Intelligence	BREACH could have been a documentary as the facts are all in place and the 2001 capture of Robert Hanssen , the most formidable spy in this country's history , is one that is mind boggling enough without the need for dramatization . Yet the screenplay by Adam Mazur and William Rotko in turn based on a story by director Billy Ray with Mazur and Rotko transforms this infamous case into a fine melodrama . The result is a smart thriller , one that holds our attention despite the fact that the results of the case are public knowledge . Robert Hanssen ( in a brilliant performance by Chris Cooper ) works in national Intelligence and is a crusty , ominous character with some strange demons in his head . FBI Agent Kate Burroughs ( Laura Linney ) studies a young FBI clerk Eric O'Neill ( Ryan Phillippe ) and decides he is the one gritty and fearless enough to assign to the suspicious Hanssen , a man the FBI feels certain is a major suspect in the breach of security . Hanssen has been selling Intelligence reports to the Soviet Union but in so careful a manner that his status is almost impenetrable . Eric is married to an East German girl Julianna ( Caroline Dhavernas ) and while she is proud of Eric's advancement in the FBI she fears his preoccupation with his work . Hanssen and his wife Bonnie ( Kathleen Quinlan ) form a friendship with Eric and Julianna and that friendship , together with a shared near obsession with the Catholic Church , gains Hanssen's trust in Eric . The tension between the investigation by the FBI and Eric's role as a mole create some terrifying situations . But Eric overcomes all obstacles and proceeds to successfully match Hanssen's inscrutable mind and behavior and in the end takes great risks in all aspects of his life to fulfill his mission . The cast is excellent with special attention to the performances of Cooper , Phillippe , and Linney . The supporting roles are carefully cast with such fine actors as Gary Cole , Dennis Haysbert , and Bruce Davison . The production values add immeasurably to the aura of suspense . This is a fine movie not only for the qualities mentioned but also for bringing to light the lack of security from even the most trusted parts of our government . Disturbing food for thought and action . Grady Harp
512765	3223254	428430	8.0	French Fluff Farce Surveys Pansexuality	The French have always been able to take issues involving sexuality , fidelity , relationships , and youth and create a healthy fun discussion : Hollywood still has problems even approaching these subjects , much less allowing itself to be lighthearted and universal . ' Crustaces et coquillages ' ( COTE D'AZUR ) is a little French film that addresses these subjects in a manner so light and fun that the viewer wonders what all the puritanical fuss is about ! It is summer on the Cote d'Azur and a fun couple Marc ( Gilbert Melki ) and Béatrix ( Valeria Bruni Tedeschi ) are vacationing in a wonderful beach house with their teenage kids Charly ( Romain Torres ) and Laura ( Sabrina Seyvecou ) where Marc lived as a youth . Laura immediately takes off to Portugal with her biker boyfriend and Charly spends his days with his friend Martin ( Edouard Collin ) , an openly gay teenager who is in love with Charly . Beatrix observes the boys ' interactions and decides her son is gay , a fact that doesn't bother her at all but that seems to cause problems for Marc . Béatrix's lover Mathieu arrives on the scene , declaring his desire for Beatrix to leave Marc : Beatrix isn't so sure - she loves Marc and her family , but also wants her summer lover . In a series of hilarious shower sequences Charly pleasures himself , and indeed the entire crew in the house does the same , and Martin's advances to Charly are rebuffed forcing Martin to seek outlet at the beach's notorious fort section . Marc decides to thwart Charly's excessive ' use ' of the shower and unplugs the hot water . Charly calls a plumber Didier ( Jean-Marc Barr ) , who just happens to be the hunky ex-lover of Marc , having had a gay affair before Marc married Beatrix . In following each other around , Charly discovers Martin and Didier and then Marc and Didier en flagrant and then walks in on Beatrix and Mathieu : everyone's secret is out ! But instead of a disaster , the cast suddenly breaks into a silly showbiz musical number blaming all the infidelities and facets of love on the ' violets ' ( the aphrodisiac of oysters ! ) . It is a cuckoo ending and would have been a better film without it , but the acting is all so rich and fine and the story is so well told , that this little diversion can be excused . This is a fun fling , with a superb cast having a good time ( especially the extraordinarily gifted Valeria Bruni Tedeschi ) . The story makes us laugh and think - all in a setting that is like a dream vacation ! Enjoy and have fun ! Grady Harp
513601	3223254	402130	8.0	The Struggles of a Broken Spirit	Rodolphe Marconi ( ' Love Forbidden ' ) is a director and writer to watch . He has a signature style already ( he is quite young in the industry ) and knows how to use that sensitivity to tell touching stories . LE DERNIER JOUR or THE LAST DAY is a mood piece , spare on dialogue , misty in its depiction of young emotional feelings , challenging in its play with time devices , and ultimately very satisfying for those who enjoy the French manner of film making . Simon ( the very handsome and gifted young actor Gaspard Ulliel of ' A Very Long Engagement ' ) boards a train bound for the coast where he is to spend time in his family's seaside cabin . Most of his ride is spent gazing out the windows at the misty countryside , telling us more about this lonely , lost , vulnerable young eighteen year boy than a thousand words . On the train is a young girl Louise ( Mélanie Laurent ) who seems to be shadowing him . When Simon arrives home he is met by his loving mother Marie ( Nicole Garcia ) , his sister Alice ( Alysson Paradis ) and his father . Louise joins Simon as a guest in his home and his family thinks the two are a couple . Though they sleep in the same bed , Simon's mind and longing are for a lad who lives in the lighthouse , Mathieu ( Thibault Vinçon ) . Simon visits Mathieu , with Louise not far behind , and though we feel a kinship between the two boys , Louise forces her attention on Mathieu and Simon becomes a third party . In a telling moment when the three are in a pub Louise insists that Simon and Mathieu kiss , and that kiss tells a lot about the current state of mind of both boys . Simon becomes isolated , longs for Mathieu who has moved on from their past relationship , an emotional level which is culminated in a visit to Mathieu's home where Simon , alone on Mathieu's bed , re-visits the passion and lust and love for Mathieu in a scene of radiant beauty . Simon's parents argue at all times and this leads to the discovery of a previous affair his mother had , an affair which holds secrets that drive a stake into Simon's relationship to Louise and to his mother's lover who as he visits the mother uncovers significant mysteries . The story ends tragically in a coda suggestive of the beginning of the film . It is stunning . For some the sparse dialogue may prevent the storyline from driving clearly , but in the hands , eyes , and body of Gabriel Ulliel words are wholly unnecessary . If there were no other reason to see this very sensitive film , having the opportunity to observe the talented Ulliel would be sufficient . Recommended viewing , in French with English subtitles .

513268	3223254	783608	8.0	A Tour de Force for a Fine Cast of Seasoned Actors	THE WALKER ( defined as a man who escorts rich ladies around town in their leisure ) is both a pungent political comment and a fine mystery from Paul Schrader who both wrote and directed this smart film and had the good fortune to surround his tale with a fine cast of actors . It may not be a film for everyone , but it will satisfy viewers who tire of superficial fluff films , allowing time to ponder the way we live and converse today . Carter Page III ( Woody Harelson in one of his finest performances ) is an openly gay , well - heeled , dapper man about town who devotes his life to pleasing the wealthy wives of men in high government levels in Washington , DC . Together with Abby ( Lily Tomlin ) , Natalie ( Lauren Bacall ) , Chrissy ( Mary Beth Hurt ) , and Lynn ( Kristin Scott Thomas ) the group gossips , plays canasta in an expensive hotel parlor , and confides secrets that are surefire rumor fodder . Lynn is escorted by Carter to her lover's home for a tryst only to find the lover murdered . Carter attempts to protect Lynn from scandal only to become implicated himself . Carter discovers secrets about his own insecurities , and while he is solidly supported by his lover Emek ( the excellent Moritz Bleibtreu ) , an artist of strange works that prove subtle background connotations of the mystery that is unwinding , he must face the realities of his decision when confronting husbands , lawyers , police , and intelligence agents ( portrayed by such fine actors as Ned Beatty , Willem Defoe , William Hope and Geff Francis ) . The story is , in many ways , an examination of the corruption in Washington , DC - a fact that may explain why it did not enjoy a long theater run . For viewers who appreciate fine dialogue and a smart story with well-delineated characters portrayed by superb actors , this is a film that should not be neglected . Grady Harp
512681	3223254	397535	8.0	A Visually and Musically Stunning Film	Why there is so much polarity with the audiences of Rob Marshall's cinematic adaptation of Arthur Golden's exquisite novel MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA is puzzling . Even in the theater there were those who left halfway through - reason unknown . Despite disagreements on the casting techniques and on the emphasis changes between the book and the film , MEMOIRS remains one of the most visually arresting , genteel films of the year . That it comes across as somewhat of an epic soap opera is no one's fault but the writers . And what is so wrong with an old-fashioned soap opera of a story afterall ? The opening scene of the turbulent sea and heavy rain that accompany the silent selling of two poor sisters to a merchant planning to place the girls in houses in Osaka gives an indication of the importance of water in this story . The sisters are delivered to a house of geishas and only one is selected by the hard madam . Through years of suffering and anguish the chosen one becomes a geisha , finds comfort from her childhood of poverty , gains loving mentoring by a top geisha , becomes the most sought after geisha in Osaka , finds her love , endures WW II and eventually returns to her dreams . The interplay between the girl and the various members of the geisha training and bartering complex add flavor and conflict that keep the story flowing . The three principal actresses - Ziyi Zhang , Michelle Yeoh , and Gong Li carry the film well . The large cast includes favorite actors Ken Watanabe and Mako . The settings are splendid , the special effects such as the cherry blossoms , the autumnal reunion of Zhang and Watanabe , Zhang's spellbinding dance - all are brilliant . John Williams ' musical score blends the best of Japanese folk music with contemporary writing and is greatly abetted by the talent of Yo-Yo Ma and Itzak Perlman . Part of the brilliance of Golden's novel was the meticulous explanation of the myriad details of geisha training and demeanor and makeup and tradition , and while the film version touches on these , the bulk of them are passed over . For this viewer there is a problem with understanding the dialogue due to the enunciation by the actors and the covering of much of the dialogue with ambient music . But that is a minor complaint . In all , MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA is an enormously beautiful and affecting film , one that multiple viewings will no doubt enhance the viewers ' appreciation . Recommended . Grady Harp , February 06
512941	3223254	374277	8.0	A Touch of Pink and Touch of Class !	Ian Iqbal Rashid is a sensitive director who is bringing the two poles of Indian Bollywood and Indie ' Hollywood ' closer together . In TOUCH OF PINK he has taken the best of both and created a tender , charming , warmly funny tale of the struggle of a Pakistani young cameraman Alim ( Jimi Mistry ) in coming to grips with his sexuality . Yes , the story has been done many times , but rarely with the genuine tenderness Rashid has found . Alim , a transplanted Pakistani youth born in Kenya , raised in Toronto , Canada and living in London , has a guardian angel in the form of Cary Grant ( Kyle MacLachlan ) who has replaced his father he never knew and who is his constant companion in his flat in London - giving advice Alim wants to hear while acting as a curtain to shield Alim from the more difficult facts of his being an openly gay male . Alim is in love with Giles ( Kristen Holden-Ried ) and they live a happy life together - until Alim's mother Nuru ( Suleka Mathew ) comes to pay them a visit . Nuru has lived alone since her husband's death , always longing for a fantasy life of fleeing the restrictions of Indian culture to become a star like Doris Day . Her life is one of frustration and her hopes for something better seem to rest on her only son Alim's getting married so that Nuru can compete with her sister currently planning an extravagant wedding for her own son Khaled . Once in London , Nuru finds Alim cold , living with a British man , and finds her hopes for a possible wedding quashed . Giles takes the reluctant Nuru for a shopping and dancing day and wins her heart . But when Nuru finally discovers Alim's secret , she leaves London , hurt , sad , and despondent . Giles is angry with Alim's harsh handling of their relationship and leaves Alim to the sole companionship of his Cary Grant . Through a series of discoveries and introspection Alim flies to Toronto to the wedding of his cousin , to appease Nuru , and there Pandora's Box opens resulting is a series of surprises that bring the actions to resolution . Though many will have seen the end coming , for those who have not seen the movie , telling the plot ending would be a sad disservice ! The dialogue is smart , the use of the Cary Grant guardian angel is excellent ( especially given the fine performance by Kyle MacLachlan ) , and the characters as portrayed by this talented and attractive cast are indeed lovable . This is a feel-good movie , a fine statement about being true to one's self , and a healthy look at gay relationships that are not either 1 ) candy coated or 2 ) sadistic or doomed . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
513016	3223254	149171	8.0	Relationshipe and how to form and keep them	STRAYS ( or DOORMEN as his script was initially titled ) marks the entry of Vin Diesel ( AKA Mark Sinclair Vincent ) into the film world in a very small budget ( under $50 , 000 . ) , independent 1997 movie he wrote , directed and acted the major role . To appreciate this very realistic , modest , slice of New York life the film presents , it helps to watch the features added to the DVD ( the film is released to the public for the first time ) : interviews with the cast and with Diesel give a sensitive and heartwarming background that enhances the movie experience . Though Diesel studied acting and worked in theater in New York prior to this film , it was not until he made his own film that he captured the attention of the people who make things happen . And now that Vin Diesel is a major Hollywood presence it is fascinating to see this initial opener . The plot is simple enough : Rick ( Diesel ) is a minor drug dealer who also works as a bouncer with his buddy Tony ( F . Valentino Morales ) , and hangs with Fred ( Joey Dedio ) and his ' brother ' ( Mike Epps , in his first role in film ) . The guys live mainly for easy sex and camaraderie - all of the have been raised by mothers without knowing their fathers ( thus , are ' strays ' ) . As Rick matures he grows tired of his shallow lifestyle , misses the connection with his mother he never developed , and is prime bait for a relationship . Into his life steps Heather ( Suzanne Lanza ) , a wholesome Midwestern girl , the two have a mutual attraction , but as their courtship dance progresses Heather disapproves of Rick's at times gang-like behavior and his drug dealing . They come together in an extended park bench conversation ( excellent writing ) during which they realize they each have repairs to do on their previous lives before they can enter a serious relationship . One aspect of this little film that makes it a cut above the many others like it is the quality of natural acting Diesel draws from his cast : uncredited female actors who provide the sex interest for the men are variably excellent , and Morales , Dedio and Lanza are particularly strong in their commitment to ensemble acting . The script is fairly strong , though the barrage of expletives becomes tiresome after a while . Yet in the end , Diesel establishes his skills as a serious actor and as a fine director and writer , and for the chance to see one of Hollywood's major talents in his nascent stage , this film is well worth watching .

513193	3223254	114854	8.0	Another Little Jewel of a Film from Australian Cinema	VIOLET'S VISIT may retrace old ground covered by other successful movies , but as written by Andrew Creagh and Barry Lowe based on a story by Richard Tarner and directed by Richard Turner this take on the joys and trials of surprise gay parenting is fresh and as unprejudiced a look as has come along in a long time . Violet aka Scooter ( Rebecca Smart ) at fifteen tires of her small town life living with a mother who repeatedly introduces new ' Dads ' ( Scooter was a love child ) and strikes out to Sydney to seek her biologic father , having been informed of his identity by her grandfather . She enters Sydney , backpack in place , and finds the address of the father whom she has never met . A knock on the door produces Pete ( David Franklin ) a lawyer who has been partnered with gym owner Alec ( Graham Harvey ) for eight years , living an openly gay life complete with extended family and successful careers . Scooter naturally thinks Pete is her father , but soon discovers on Alec's return home that Alec is her biologic father and has denied her existence to everyone , including clueless Pete . Scooter is chagrined at her father's lifestyle as much as Alec is perplexed at having to face a fifteen-year-old daughter , a simple girl who seeks to be a designer ( of kitschy objects ) instead of attending school . With Pete's intervention and big heart the trio grow into a comfort zone and Scooter moves in with Alec and Pete . Gradually the roles of father impact both Alec and Pete , and Scooter grows frustrated when she is unable to find friends and feels as outsider . She becomes infatuated with a friend of her fathers - Wayne ( Caleb Packham ) - only to discover that he , too , is a happily adjusted gay man . When Alec and Pete are caught up in a disagreement about their new living situation , Scooter takes to the streets . Her extended absence only serves to bring the couple together in a new appreciation for the importance of family and their mutual love for Scooter . The way in which the story is resolved is predictable but genuinely warm and tender . Not only is the film well paced , it never makes the error of going over the top in its depiction of either Scooter's plight or in the manner in which gay people are realized . All of the male actors are handsome , buff late 30s / early 40s and are so comfortable in their roles that their sexuality is simply an aside . Graham , Franklin , and Smart are excellent actors and their screen presence engenders an audience response of credible warmth . The one aspect of the film that may present a problem for non-Australian viewers is the fact that the Aussie accents are so thick that the script at times is indecipherable ! But that also adds to the flavor of this small but significantly impactful film . Well Done !
513233	3223254	374583	8.0	What price glory ?	COMME UNE IMAGE ( LOOK AT ME ) is a tough little film that practically defies the viewer to love it . Rated as a comedy , it has few chuckles of the usual kind , but the smart tidy script delivers more of the Reformation-type comedy - wit with a bite . Writer / director and star Agnès Jaoui ( her co-author is her ex-husband Jean-Pierre Bacri who also stars ) is obviously an intelligent , observant , caustic chronicler of contemporary French society who dotes on celebrities at the expense of their own self-respect . Not a single character in this film is likable , but each one is fascinatingly interesting and a bit warped . Their interaction provides the venom that in Jaoui's hands raises the bar on the range of comedy . Étienne Cassard ( Jean-Pierre Bacri ) is a famous writer whose latest novel has been ' transformed ' into a schmaltzy film about which he is loathsomely embarrassed . He is caustic , acerbic , and emotionally negligent of both his grown obese daughter Lolita ( Marilou Berry ) , who devotes her resentful life in an attempt to being a famous concert singer , and to his new wife Karine ( Virginie Desarnauts ) and little daughter . Lolita's music coach is Sylvia ( Agnès Jaoui ) whose demands on her students reflect her frustrated life being married to an unknown author Pierre ( Laurent Grévill ) . Odd paths cross and it is through Lolita's influence as the daughter of a famous writer Étienne that Sylvia arranges for Pierre to join forces with Étienne and gain acceptance and popularity , but the consequences include Sylvia's increased tutelage for Lolita and her group of fellow madrigal singers . Lolita comes the closest to being a character about whom we care . She is distraught about her weight , her distant father , her stepmother and stepsister , her inability to gain the affection for the boy of her dreams , her struggle to become a significant performer - all of which prevents her from recognizing the man who could salvage it all - Sébastien ( Keine Bouhiza ) who literally falls at her feet ! All of these characters interact in complex and at times trying ways , ever cognizant of the ' authority of celebrity ' and the results of these engagements form the body of the film . The acting is on a high level , the dialogue is crisp and smart , and the musical background for this mélange is a gorgeous mixture of classical music ranging from Buxtehude through Schubert ( ' An die Musik ' plays a big role ! ) and many others . This ' comedy ' is more intellectual than entertaining , but if wit and elegance of acting brings you joy , then this is a film to see . In French with subtitles at a long 2 hours ! Grady Harp
513141	3223254	343737	8.0	Espionage , One Slow Step At A Time	THE GOOD SHEPHERD may take a lot of patience to sit through the nearly three hour tale written by Eric Roth ( Munich , Forrest Gump , Ali , The Horse Whisperer , etc ) and directed with meticulous attention to detail by Robert De Niro , but in the end the film about the creation of CIA ( " ever notice that no one these ' the CIA ' just like no one use ' the God ' ? " ) . And although the script confuses the viewer by its propensity to meander over many time frames and many places , the result is a tense attention holding look at the machinations of big government and frightening big Intelligence organizations . We first meet Edward Bell Wilson ( Matt Damon , who carries the film well ) as a son who witnesses his father's suicide , a fact he will hide for years . He follows in the family footsteps of attending Yale , participating in the infamous Skull and Bones secret club , and progressed to join the government as an agent for Intelligence , eventually helping to form CIA and participate in the Cold War tension with Russia and the Bay of Pigs incident . Wilson is a nebbish on the surface , but underneath lies a man devoted to his country and a man capable of maintaining heavy secrets , even from his wife-of-necessity Clover ( Angelina Jolie ) whom he marries solely because he got her pregnant . He is distant , covert , and seemingly cold , a trait that he will pass on to his son whose life following CIA results in tragedy . Along the way from this personal side of the story the plot is filled with politicians , spies , Russian , moles , double agents - all the expected and needed characters for a story of this sort . The cast includes such important actors as Billy Crudup , Joe Pesci , Alec Baldwin , a superb Tammy Blanchard , Robert De Niro himself , Keir Dullea , Michael Gambon , William Hurt , John Turturro , Timothy Hutton and Gabriel Macht , each performing excellent cameos . The production values are equally strong with Robert Richardson as director of photography mixing historical footage with atmospheric cinematography , a fine musical score by Bruce Fowler and Marcelo Zarvos , and a tight editing by Tariq Anwar . The film could easily have been cut by an hour without damaging the effect , but there is something to be said for the level of tension achieved by De Niro's choices that gives us a feeling of being a part of the Intelligence schemes . It takes patience , but the film is worth viewing . Grady Harp
512807	3223254	385004	9.0	Visual Splendor for a Touching Romance	When the neighborhood movie houses seem to have an overwhelming number of martial arts films , both takeoffs on ' Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon ' quality and the ' Matrix ' clone dalliances , and when the whole concept of mind-boggling flying armed forms threatens to become passé , along comes another film by Yimou Zhang and the atmosphere changes . Zhang fully understands the choreographic possibilities if this genre of films and surpasses his fellow directors with his sensitivity to story . Yes , HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS has more special effects than can be listed here , but FINALLY the special effects embroider a tender love triangle in the year 859 AD at the core of the dissolution of the Tang Dynasty . Mei ( Ziyi Zhang ) is the daughter of the deceased leader of a dissident group called House of Flying Daggers , and posing as a dancer in the Peony Pavilion , seeks to kill the captain of the Tang army Jin ( Takeshi Kaneshiro ) . Under surveillance , both Mei and Jin are captured by loyalist Leo ( Andy Lau ) and while both escape , imprints of the two men and one woman have been set and the resulting chase leads to much action , fighting , and ultimate entanglement of the three in a tender and pathetic love triangle . How this resolves is the basis for the very supernatural ending . The story is sound and amazingly credible due to the fine acting by the trio . But the real glories of this symphonic excursion are the lush colors , magnificent costumes , the exquisite choreography of dance and martial arts , and the breathtaking camera work observing the forests and glens in the richest colors of autumn and winter . Simply stated , this film is dazzling and brilliantly conceived and executed . An additional factor in the film is the musical score by Shigeru Umebayashi interspersed with old Chinese songs played on authentic instruments . On the DVD there is a music video that features Kathleen Battle singing the main song , and while the song and the video are not remarkable , it is a pleasure to see that Kathleen Battle is still singing and , though somewhat older in appearance , still lovely of face and voice . The additional DVD features of the making of the film are far above average , especially Zhang's story of how the unexpected early snow during the shooting encouraged him to utilize this miracle of nature and indeed supply some of the more beautiful scenes in the film .
513112	3223254	402057	9.0	Told the Way Myths Can Be Remembered	BEOWULF & GRENDEL as the title of this wonderfully atmospheric retelling of the myth is well selected : the usual name of the myth is simply BEOWULF but Sturla Gunnarsson , with the aid of screenwriter Andrew Rai Berzins , appreciates the importance of the ' creature ' Grendel and gives him equal billing . Not all audiences will agree with the decision to make Grendel ' humanized ' ( he was actually a giant troll monster in the original tale ) , but the manner in which this story is related makes this concept of Grendel as a being with memory and feelings more pertinent to contemporary audiences . King Hrothgar ( Stellan Skarsgård ) once killed a troll whose son Grendel ( Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson ) survived and has been vengefully killing the Danish court of the king to the point that the king has lost all power . A monk , Brendan the Celt ( Eddie Marsan ) , comes to Denmark ( the time is 400 AD ) to spread Christianity , baptize the population and pray for the protection of the people form Grendel . King Hrothgar calls upon a Hero in the form of Beowulf ( Gerard Butler ) who travels the seas , only to be shipwrecked and come ashore with his few men to aid the decimated kingdom and king . Once in Denmark , Beowulf strategizes his attack on Grendel , the mighty son of the original troll , survives the many attacks that leave many dead and torn limb from limb , and finally is responsible for ridding the land of Grendel . Along the way Beowulf is aided by a witch Selma ( Sarah Polley ) who defends Grendel's philosophy : we later discover that she bore a child by Grendel . After many chases and conflicts Beowulf is responsible for Grendel's death and the kingdom rejoices while Beowulf is conflicted by the fact that he has killed a troll with a heart and soul . There are many metaphors between Christianity and mythology that are beautifully explored by the story as told here . Filmed in Iceland and Canada the mythic mood of the tale is well served by cinematographer Jan Kiesser and the musical score by Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson . One is reminded of the paintings of Odd Nerdrum . The stormy darkness of the entire film fits the story well and the actors , especially the always superb and charismatic Gerard Butler , make their characters as credible as myth allows . The many accents of the actors make understanding the lines a problem and even though the dialogue is in English , subtitles would have greatly helped understanding the storyline as it unfolds . Many people will object to the character of Grendel as extracted here from the original myth , but for this observer the way in which we are allowed to understand the motivation of this rather pitiful beast makes the story far more poignant . The added features on the DVD include Gerard Butler discussing his role and his decision to accept the Beowulf persona . And equally as interesting is a behind the scenes track that demonstrates the difficulties in filming a story in rugged terrain . In all this is a visually stunning , emotionally moving film well worth the attention of the audience . Grady Harp
513621	3223254	829098	9.0	Distances and Proximities : Fathers and Sons	Based on an autobiographical memoir by Blake Morrison WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER ? is a finely wrought exploration into the delicate issues that both separate and bind fathers and sons . It is difficult for viewers whose fathers are gone not to relate to the profound tenderness and at times difficult reminiscences of their own relationships that remain as both warm and haunting dreams . David Nicholls ' adaptation of Morrison's book stresses the character development of both father and son ( and the rest of this British family ) allowing us to understand the dilemma that faces the main character as he is asked the question that forms the title of this film . Blake Morrison ( Colin Firth ) is happily married to Kathy ( Gina McKee ) and is a successful writer / poet who is preparing to receive an award for his contributions to literature . Present at his ceremony is his father Dr . Arthur Morrison ( Jim Broadbent ) who is a unique egomaniac whose personality traits affect everyone around him - both positively and negatively . After Blake's acceptance speech his father cannot even manage to say ' well done ' , instead furthers his comments about Blake's silly decision not to go into medicine and strive instead for the poor life of a writer . A medical emergency tosses Arthur into the hospital , he is diagnosed with terminal cancer : the remainder of the film is a series of vignettes of Blake at his father's bedside accompanied by his mother Kim ( Juliet Stephenson ) coupled with flashbacks to Blake's childhood ( Matthew Beard plays Blake as a teenager ) memories that contain moments of confusing father / son incidents as well as Blake's long standing loathing of his fathers affairs with other women such as ' Aunt Beaty ' ( Sarah Lancashire ) and others . As Arthur falls more deeply toward dying , Blake attempts to confront his father with his lifelong perceptions and grievances and the manner in which Blake comes to grips with his feelings for his father completes this film . Director Anand Tucker orchestrates this story beautifully , blending the gorgeous English countryside with just the right timing between momentary flashbacks and flash forwards to make this film flow and glow with nostalgia . The musical score by Barrington Pheloung wisely incorporates a lovely rendition of Bellini's ' Casta diva ' from ' Norma ' , Bach's G Minor Piano Concerto , and a Schubert trio , which add a timeless dimension to the mood of the film . Jim Broadbent brings off this challenging role with great artistry , as does Colin Firth with his role as Blake . But then the entire cast is well selected from some of England's finest actors . This is an emotional film , a film that will touch men especially , but will also bring resonance with women . Grady Harp
513286	3223254	438315	9.0	Be Everything You Are	Some films make a difference : viewing them can give us a story that is memorable and leave the viewer with powerful food for thought that continues to influence thinking long after the film is over . Such is the case for PEACEFUL WARRIOR . Based on a book by Inspirational Guru Dan Millman and beautifully adapted for the screen by Kevin Bernhardt , the story combines the best in sport stories with the infusion of spiritual discovery that despite the abundance of ' Hallmark-like ' imitations , stands nobly as a tool for introducing young people to a journey toward self discovery well worth taking . Director Victor Salva had the good sense not to push the story over the top , but instead to let his actors and situations grow logically into a practical demonstration of spiritual growth . Dan Millman ( Scott Mechlowicz ) is a gymnast bent on perfecting his skills to enter the Olympic trials . He is a fine athlete but has an ego that consumes everything around him and prevents his finding a focus to be the perfect athlete he feels he can become . After a chance encounter with a mysterious Service Station attendant whom Dan calls Socrates ( Nick Nolte ) , Dan's inner struggles begin to surface as he sees and experiences troubling ' other-worldly ' responses form Socrates . He is ultimately forced to confront that he is living for pride , for accomplishment , for competition , for recognition - yet his quiet moments remain discontent . Socrates works with Dan , helping him to find his inner self and to live in the moment . Dan suffers a life-threatening motorcycle accident that appears to doom his dreams of being the finest gymnast , but Socrates helps him discover that living in the moment , giving in to the power of focus on the present , can result in overcoming the seemingly impossible obstacles . Rather than ' preach ' these concepts , the story is illustrated by physical feats of gymnastics and by meaningful encounters between Dan and Socrates , and it is this technique that brings the film above the usual ' inspirational flicks ' to become a truly compelling movie . Nick Nolte has never been better as the subdued , understated , but immensely impressive Socrates . Scott Mechlowicz thankfully underplays the character of Dan : the use of a body double to perform the incredible gymnastic turns is seamlessly achieved . The remainder of the cast includes such fine actors as Amy Smart , Agnes Bruckner , and Ashton Holmes . This is a well-made film that deserves our attention , especially now . Grady Harp
513529	3223254	417614	9.0	Caring for Others , Taking Care of the Self	DREAMLAND is one of those little Indie films that sneaks up on you , draws you in and leaves you feeling fulfilled . Written by Tom Willett and directed with great sensitivity to both style and message by Jason Matzner , the film boasts a truly remarkable cast in every role and the ensemble acting is some of the finest in this year's lineup . " Dreamland " is the name of a very small trailer park in New Mexico , out in the sticks , yes , but surrounded by the magnificence of majestic clouds in crystalline blue skies and a land free of industrial detritus - except for the powerlines that play such an important role in the story . In a sad trailer house live Audrey ( Agnes Bruckner ) , a poet who has given up chances for college to remain with her father Henry ( John Corbett ) , a man decimated by the death of his wife to the point that he is unable to leave the trailer even to buy the beer and cigarettes that sustain his life . Audrey also is caring for her closest friend Calista ( Kelli Garner ) , a beautiful girl who dreams of becoming Miss America but knows her life is to be shortened by the fact that she suffers from Multiple Sclerosis . Audrey writes her poetry but her life is consumed by being the caretaker for Henry and Calista . Into the trailer park moves a new ' family ' - hunky young Mookie ( Justin Long ) and his mother ex-singer / performer Mary ( Gina Gershon ) and her live-in boyfriend Herb ( Chris Mulkey ) . Audrey and Calista watch them unpack and while both girls find Mookie attractive , Audrey talks Calista into dating him . Audrey's only male contact is her ' sex-buddy ' , tacky and gawky Abraham ( Brian Klugman ) who works at the local convenience store with Audrey . Mookie and Calista begin an affair while Audrey looks on longingly , and when Calista lets Mookie know she has MS the relationship is strained : Mookie also is leaving for the university soon . Audrey confesses her feelings for Mookie and Calista flees on a motorcycle to chase the now departed Mookie . She is in an accident and is hospitalized and since she has broken her relationship with her caretaker Audrey , Henry manages to draw enough courage to leave his trailer to sit at Calista's hospital bedside - along with visits from Mookie . Calista's accident makes her even more aware of her fractured future and she releases her feelings for Mookie , reconnects with Audrey , and Audrey's father discovers her many letters of acceptance to college she has hidden to prevent abandoning her role as caretaker and convinces Audrey to flow with her dreams instead of being imprisoned in Dreamland . And the manner in which each of the characters in the film resolves the changes now facing them is the tender ending of the story . DREAMLAND is created by a very strong cast of fine actors who dwell solidly within their characters ' psyches , making this somewhat surreal story very real indeed . The setting is extraordinary in its ordinariness and the camera-work by Jonathan Sela is impeccable . This is a strong story about coming of age , about quality of love , and about being human . It is a treasure . Grady Harp
512641	3223254	446059	9.0	A Fitting Valedictory for Jet Li	Jet Li has been an impressive presence in film as a martial arts practitioner and choreographer both in his native China and in his US films . He has selected FEARLESS as his final film as a martial artist and a better choice of story for a final bow could not be imagined . Based on the life of Chinese Martial Arts Master Huo Yuanjia ( 1869-1910 ) , the founder and spiritual leader of the Jin Wu Sports Federation still in existence internationally , Jet Li acts the role of Huo Yuanjia , a man whose father's heroics were surpassed only by his compassion , a trait the film shows us to be the lesson learned by Huo Yuanjia . Beginning with his childhood where all of his influences and those people who altered his life are introduced by child actors ( the weakest portion of this film ) , he grows into the role as champion Washu fighter of his province , but his championship is not without problems : he inadvertently kills his final opponent opening a series of tragedies that drives him , a broken man , into the rural area of China where he learns the simple life and ideals of his people . He returns to his province to visit the sites of his family's memorials and the memorial of the man he killed . He further accepts a challenge to fight again only this time despite onerous odds he allows his spiritual awakening to govern the outcome . The film is lushly beautiful with some of the finest cinematography of China we have yet to see . The choreography of the fight sequences is superb and Jet Li commits his all to the role both as actor and martial arts fighter . The audience is left feeling a new sense of respect for the travails of China at the early part of the 20th century , for the field of Marital Arts , for the dignity of one of China's heroes , and for the performer / actor Jet Li . It is a most fitting valedictory . Grady Harp
513459	3223254	462477	10.0	A Brilliant Little Film Opens the Window to an Unknown Profession	PIERREPOINT : THE LAST HANGMAN is one of those films that emerges from the cracks in the theater ' failures ' only to find its poignant message when released on DVD . Granted , the idea of a story based on England's most famous executioner doesn't immediately catch the interest of the general audience , but for those fortunate enough to either rent or buy this DVD , the rewards are plentiful . It is a little masterpiece of writing , acting , directing and production values . Albert Pierrepoint was the third man in his family to ' ascend ' to the list of executioners ( capital punishment in England at the time was by hanging ) , and when he is accepted to the list in 1932 he begins what became the longest and most prolific career of British executioners . He took enormous pride in his work , assuring his peers as well as his ' victims ' that every aspect of his job was done with obsessive professionalism : his timing of his duties was the shortest on record , meaning that from the moment he opened the door to the condemned prisoner's room through the hooding and noose placement and tripping of the platform and subsequent death of the ' criminal ' , he spared suffering as much as was feasible . He was supported by a wife who kept the secret of her husband's anonymous role and it was only when the Pierrepoint's pride in his job became known that downfall of their lives is threatened . At times adored by the public for his assignment to hand the Nazi criminals and the famous murderers and eventually the target of the anti capital punishment activists , Pierrepoint's professionalism sustained him until a final tragic assignment changed his view of his job . Timothy Spall is splendid as Pierrepoint , capturing all of the nuances of the simple , honest man's pride as well as his Achilles ' heel . Juliet Stevenson turns in yet another understated and completely realized role as Pierrepoint's wife . Director Adrian Shergold , using a script written by Bob Mills and Jeff Pope , paces the film sensitively , drawing on the atrocious duties involved in the job of executioner ( they actually had to prepare the bodies of the dead victims for the morticians ! ) along with the moments of pub frivolity to allow the audience to understand the true person Timothy Spall absorbs in his portrayal of Pierrepoint . The sets and lighting and cinematography could not be better . This is a film to view and absorb and appreciate the superior quality of acting of Spall and Stevenson . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
512968	3223254	372824	10.0	' Music that soothes the savage beast . . . '	LES CHORISTES ( THE CHORUS ) is director Christophe Berratier's first foray into the realm of full-length films and his adaptation of the 1945 film LA CAGE AUX ROSSINGNOLS written by Georges Chaperot and René Wheeler serves to introduce his talents as a master storyteller well . This tale of how music can alter the lives of even most renegade of boys is warm , sensitive , and satisfying on every level . The story opens with the reunion of two men who were classmates at Fond de l'Etang , a boarding school for troubled boys in France in 1949 . Pepinot ( Didier Flammand ) arrives at the door of consummate symphony conductor Pierre Morhange ( Jacques Perrin ) with a journal written by their beloved teacher Clement Mathieu , now dead , and the two read the journal , recalling their shared childhood experiences at Fond de l'Etang . 1949 and the Fond de l'Etang is a dreary jail-like , rundown place run by the cruel disciplinarian headmaster Rachin ( François Berléand ) . Clément Mathieu ( Gérard Jugnot ) is an older , bald , failed musician who seeks employment as a prefect in the school and immediately is forced to confront the rigors of the school's harsh discipline with the still flagrantly wild boys . Mathieu slowly wins the confidence of his boys by standing up to the cruel Rachin and when he is near his wits ' end as to how to transform his class , he hears a boy sing and decides to use his musical talent to change these boys ' lives . Two of the chief problem children are the angry but vocally gifted Pierre Morhange ( Jean-Baptiste Maunier ) and Leclerc ( Théodul Carré-Cassaigne ) and Mathieu coaxes them into the inner circle of his newly developing chorus . The other child who is without talent but for whom Mathieu empathizes when the child waits every Saturday for someone to claim him at the gates is Pepinot ( Maxence Perrin ) who Mathieu assigns as his assistant chorus master ! Through a series of incidents including the cruelty of Rachin , the appearance of Violette Morhange ( Pierre's poor working mother who cannot afford to feed him ) , the success of the chorus in the eyes of the Countess ( Carol Weiss ) who acts as benefactor to the school , and some evil doings of the more difficult children , Mathieu's Chorus becomes a symbol for how problem children can bond in mutual need to the enrichment music provides . Rachin cannot tolerate Mathieu's success and fires him without allowing him to say a farewell to his beloved choristers . The manner in which this is portrayed is most touching and spiritually enriching and serves to resolve the mystery of Mathieu's departure to the adult Morhange and Pepinot as they finish the journal . Simple story , told before , but superbly acted and performed . The music is by Jean-Philippe Rameau with original songs by director Barratier and Bruno Coulais , all beautifully sung by Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc with young actor Jean-Baptiste Maunier singing his own solos . The cinematography is in the capable hands of Jean-Jacques Bouhon , Dominique Gentil , and Carlo Varini . In French with English subtitles . Highly recommended little jewel of a film ! Grady Harp
513718	3223254	870111	10.0	The Rise and Fall of Showmen	FROST / NIXON is one of the most successful screen adaptations of a play yet made . Perhaps that is due in part to the fact that the popular stage play by Peter Morgan was revised for the screen by the playwright , but it is also to the credit of director Ron Howard who managed to suffuse the ' play as movie ' with such atmosphere and feeling of spontaneity that the rather long movie seems to whisk by more rapidly than history ! Everyone knows of the infamous David Frost interview with Richard Nixon after Nixon had resigned office and was living in semi-seclusion in San Clemente , California , a bitter man struggling with the demons not only form the recent past but also form his childhood . Frost took on the challenge to bring the perpetrator of the Watergate scandal to his knees to satisfy the American public's need for retribution , and in conducting these interviews he did indeed achieve that . The story is as much a character study of Frost as it is of Nixon and the parallels writer Morgan uncovers makes the film far more than a quasi-documentary . This is real drama played for all it's worth . Frank Langella is unforgettable in his portrayal of Nixon as is Michael Sheen as Frost , each actor having played the roles on Broadway and transferring that depth of understanding to the screen . The surprise in this film is the use of the peripheral cast of characters - Kevin Bacon , Oliver Platt , Sam Rockwell , Matthew Macfadyen , and Toby Jones - a group of actors who light the darker corners of the story with aplomb . FROST / NIXON should be required viewing for every Political Science major in our schools - and hopefully will urge the nation to find a similar manner to bring closure to the strangely coincidental machinations of the recent Bush administration crimes .

512955	3223254	382765	10.0	A Murder and Its Implications on a Town and Families	JINDABYNE is a disturbing , somber little film from Australia - a film with profound observations about ethics , racism , the fragility of marriage , the vulnerability of children's minds , and the desperate need for respect for beliefs and peoples outside the mainstream . Beatrix Christian adapted the screenplay from one of Raymond Carver's brilliant short stories , ' So Much Water So Close to Home ' : it has been said that Carver had ' the ability to render graceful prose from dreary , commonplace , scrapping-the-bottom human misery ' and this story embodies all of those traits . As directed by Ray Lawrence with a cast of excellent actors , JINDABYNE will likely become a classic movie - if enough people will take the time and commitment to see it . In a small town called Jindabyne in Australia a group of four men depart their families for a fishing trip : Stewart Kane ( Gabriel Byrne ) , Carl ( John Howard ) , Rocco ( Stelios Yiakmis ) and Billy ( Simon Stone ) . While fly fishing in the back country , Stewart discovers the nude , murdered body of a dead Aboriginal girl Susan ( Tatea Reilly ) floating in the water , calls his buddies to witness the ugly act , and together they decide to wait until their fishing trip is over before reporting it . When the men return home , concerned and embarrassed about their actions as they report to the police , the town is outraged at their thoughtless behavior . Yet more outraged are the wives of the men - Carl's wife Jude ( Deborra-Lee Furness ) , Rocco's mate Carmel ( Leah Purcell ) , Billy's ' wife ' Elissa ( Alice Garner ) and , most of all , Stewart's wife Claire ( Laura Linney ) - a woman with a history of mental instability for whom her husband's insensitivity becomes intolerable . Claire sets out to ' right ' things with the Aboriginal tribe who are devastated at the murder and the disregard for another human being's life that the fishermen have demonstrated . The town and the families ( including children ) are fractured by the deed - and the strange aspect is that no one appears concerned to discover the murderer , the greater ' crime ' has been against human decency . In a powerfully moving final memorial for the dead girl every one is forced to face the dirty aspects of the recent events and come to a degree of understanding and acceptance . Filmed in the beauty of the Australian countryside with camera technique that feels intimate and almost spying in nature , the story unfolds so naturally that the audience is made to feel a part of the dilemma at hand . The acting is first rate : Laura Linney once again proves she is one of our finest actresses , and Gabriel Byrne makes his odd character wholly believable . The supporting cast ( especially the women ) is outstanding . This is a sleeper of a film that deserves a wide audience , an audience ready to commit to thinking and reacting to an act and subsequent public response that , while difficult to swallow , is essential information if we are to exist in the society we have created . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
512889	3223254	415978	10.0	Connecting : Life through a child's eyes , longingly	In a year of a true mixed bag of films and now that the year has officially passed , ME AND YOU AND EVERYONE WE KNOW remains one of the most refreshing features of 2005 . Written , directed , and starring one Miranda July ( a performance artist ) , this truly unique film has many firsts in its message , its manner of storytelling , its vision , its honesty , and its perception of life as we are currently living it . It is a little gem . There are about five stories delicately laced together in this examination of a spectrum of emotionally isolated people and their attempts to connect to each other . Miranda intentionally keeps these remarkable stories separate ( reflecting her concept that we have arrived at a state where we all are sadly alone longing to belong ) , and yet each of the characters knows each other - by proximity of living space , working space , street corners , chatrooms , and bus benches . Richard Swersey ( John Hawkes in a deeply multidimensional performance ) has recently lost his African American wife because she was bored , leaving Richard and their two sons , 14-year-old Peter ( Miles Thompson ) and 7-year-old Robby ( Brandon Ratcliff ) to move to a new apartment . Richard , desperate for attention has set fire to his hand , trying to impress his boys and deflect the pain of losing his wife . He is a simple shoe salesman and ties to make a happy world for his boys . Christine ( Miranda July ) , a video artist with strange techniques makes her living driving Eldercab , taking old people shopping . On one of these excursions she encounters Richard at his shoe store , is smitten by him , longs to be attractive to men in general and Richard in particular and goes at great lengths to " connect " to the reluctant Richard . Peter and Robby get to know their neighbors : Rebecca ( Najarra Townsend ) and Heather ( Natasha Slayton ) are under 18 with foaming hormones who flirt with Richard's co-worker Andrew ( Brad William Henke ) which drives him to leave porno notes to them on his Venetian blinds , and who eventually introduce Peter to a game of ' differential diagnosis of fellatio ' ; Sylvie ( Carlie Westerman ) who occupies her lonely life by preparing her hope chest for her ideal marriage of the future . They entertain themselves by entering chatrooms , a diversion Robby quickly masters and lines up an online date through his hilarious ideas of seduction ! Christine devotes her own time to making her art and in attempting to get noticed she approaches a gallerist who can't be bothered but who re-enters the story further in the film in a way that demonstrates that she is not the cold , self-sufficient woman she appears to be . There are far too many moments of exquisitely detailed glimpses of how each of these wonderful characters become momentarily tangent then bounce away like random atoms in orbit to quickly to even begin to relate . But that is the joy of this film . Miranda July plucks little gems from the air , disperses them throughout the film , leaves most hanging because that is the way we are living , and yet leaves us feeling that the vision of an untainted tabula rasa child's stance is beautifully fresh . Each member of this very strong cast gives performances of complete pleasure : July knows her vision and describes it well . Highly Recommended for those who long for fresh and stunning independent films . Grady Harp
513378	3223254	384929	10.0	Accountability and the Need for Passion in an Alienating World	THE DYING GAUL , written and directed by Craig Lucas ( writing credits include ' Longtime Companion ' , ' Prelude to a Kiss ' , ' Reckless ' ) is a brilliant little film that stirred comment and appreciation during its unfortunately very brief run in the theaters ( as one of the film's characters comments " Most Americans hate gay people . If they hear it's about gay people , they won't go . " ) And this in a year when films such as ' Brokeback Mountain ' , ' Transamerica ' , and ' Capote ' drew focus . As the oft-used phrase states , ' Go figure ' . The story is a bizarre triangle of interaction among three very bright , enlightened , yet passionately isolated people whose coming together is the stuff of tragedy on the grand scale . Robert Sandrich ( Peter Sarsgaard ) is a grieving screenwriter ( his lover recently died from complications of AIDS in a manner secretly gnawing at Robert ) . His most recent screenplay ' The Dying Gaul ' about a gay couple - one with AIDS - is a tribute to his lover , and while it is a brilliant script and is taken on by a top film producer Jeffrey Tishop ( Campbell Scott ) , Jeffrey offers to buy the script for a million dollars IF Robert re-writes the script to make the couple a heterosexual one ( see above for his reason ) . Robert at first refuses to ' sell out ' but eventually gives in and does the re-write . Jeffrey is married to a very bright ex-screenwriter Elaine ( Patricia Clarkson ) who reads Robert's script , loves the original and becomes so obsessed with the script and with Robert that she plunges into an investigation of Robert's life . Compounding the intrigue is the fact that Jeffrey begins to fall in love with Robert and Robert is so needy emotionally that he responds : the two become lovers . Elaine enters Robert's private life via chat room discussion where she poses as the voice of Robert's dead lover and inadvertently discovers secrets that eventually bring the trio to a devastating climax : secrets are revealed that demand accountability and each character is permanently altered . Craig Lucas , in this his first directorial outing , proves to be an artist with style , with vision , and with guts to put tough material into visual form . The pacing is tense , the ideas are well developed from the meaning of the title to the cruelty of the machine mode means of conversation via email chat rooms . He handles sexuality variations as well as any director today . He of course is blessed with a trio of superlative actors : Sarsgaard , Clarkson and Campbell give extraordinary performances . The cinematography by Bobby Bukowski revels in the brilliance of the California sun at poolside as well as the eerie light from the computer screen in darkened rooms - further underlining the alienation that medium demands . And the crowning addition is a musical score by gifted composer Steve Reich ( one of the finest of today's classical composers ) . THE DYING GAUL is a tough film but one that is so refreshingly dedicated to its vision that it scores as a major work . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
512704	3223254	375154	10.0	Rays of Light from Legends of the Dark Ages	Period pieces can be a tough sell , especially if they cannot rely on big budgets , extravagant sets and fight scenes , and the opulence of big name movie stars to carry them ( think Troy , Alexander the Great , etc ) . TRISTAN AND ISOLDE unfortunately had none of the above to propel it through the important theater run , yet having seen the DVD in the quiet of the home gives proof that all the accoutrements are not necessary if the piece has a vision starting with the writer ( Dean Georgaris ) and played through with a director such as Kevin Reynolds ( Count of Monte Cristo , Rapa Nui , Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves , etc ) and produced by sensitive designers and a credible group of fine actors . For this viewer , this very unique version of the Tristan and Isolde legend works very well , transporting us into the post Roman empire of the 600s AD when what is now England was a cluster of disjointed tribes and Ireland was the superior force . Realizing the proximity of Britain to Ireland aids the credibility of the action , an action dependent upon easy access via the ocean to the warring countries . Appropriately , Georgaris begins his amalgamation of the legend with Tristan ( Thomas Sangster ) as an orphaned child who is taken in by Lord Marke ( Rufus Sewell ) and raised with Melot ( Henry Cavill ) as a family that yearns for the unification of the Briton tribes in solidarity against the threat of Ireland , ruled by King Donnchadh ( David O'Hara ) whose daughter Isolde ( Isobel Scott Moynihan ) shares the same sorcery healing skills as her loyal maidservant Bragnae ( Bronagh Gallagher ) . Time passes and Tristan becomes a man ( James Franco ) and Isolde a woman ( Sophia Myles ) and in a serendipitous move Tristan is thought killed by Isolde's ugly betrothed ( while the betrothed is actually killed by Tristan ) but washes ashore in Ireland where his critical wounds are nursed by Isolde and Bragnae and the two begin a love affair doomed by royal rules . The remainder of the tale shows the many trials a young love must endure : Tristan is sent as Marke's representative to fight in a tournament in Ireland , the winner being promised the hand of Isolde . Tristan wins the tournament but because of his loyalty to King Marke he is obliged to bring Isolde to Britain to wed Marke . The two lovers remain secretly passionately in love but also deeply respectful for the kind King Marke , but as the various tribes of Britain still compete for power , rumors are arranged and the lovers are exposed , much to the pain of Marke . All of this seemingly complicated plot is in truth a simple love story of a love forbidden by rules but solid by passion . Though there are many versions of this old tale ( and there are moments when the viewer will ask questions about the love potion and Kurnewal and the character of Melot , etc that many know best from Wagner's adaptation for his opera ) , this version works very well . The settings in Ireland and the Czech Republic are dark and windswept and redolent of the Dark Ages , and the toughest of all assignments - creating a music score that doesn't attempt to compete with Wagner - is beautifully written by Anne Dudley . Yet such a story relies heavily on the actors and James Franco is a pensive yet brilliant warrior torn between love and duty and Sophia Myles creates an Isolde of incomparable beauty , balancing fragility of heart with strength of character . Rufus Sewell is a brilliant King Marke , Bronagh Gallagher a superlative Bragnae , and the smaller roles such as Henry Cavill's eye-candy Melot , David O'Hara's grisly Donnchadh and Mark Strong's seething Wictred bring total commitment to the screen . The DVD adds excellent features about the making of the film that for once truly enhances the viewing experience , making the viewer want to return immediately to the story to see how the magic was fulfilled . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
512823	3223254	450972	10.0	' All the world's a stage '	Kenneth Branagh , aside from being a gifted actor with an enormous range of creative character abilities , has once again brought Shakespeare to life on the screen . His previous excursions into the bard's repertoire have included ' Much Ado About Nothing ' , ' Henry V ' , ' Love's Labours Lost ' , ' Hamlet ' , and ' Othello ' , and now he adds one of the bard's most successful comedies AS YOU LIKE IT to his list of successes . Branagh has the gift of making the visual aspects of Shakespeare's stories enhance the language and in doing so he makes Shakespeare sound like brilliant conversation ( which it of course is ) instead of stilted and brittle old English . The ' gimmick ' used here by Branagh in adapting Shakespeare's play is placing the action in 19th century Japan , and while other less sensitive directors might have opted to insert parody here , Branagh instead makes the story seem all the more plausible - the two feuding brothers ( one dark and one light ) whose struggle over their estate opens the play before credits with an ingenious silent drama of black leather feudal costumed men invading a genteel house party of lovely people enjoying a Japanese dancer's performance . The original brother is banished with his clan to the Arden forest and there the magic begins . Love between several couples is played in all its manifestations with disguise , misconceptions , lust , and poetry until the play's rollicking end in a song of Hey Nonny Nonny ! The lovers include the disguised Rosalind ( Bryce Dallas Howard ) and Orlando ( David Oyelowo ) , Celia ( Romola Garai ) and Oliver ( Adrian Lester ) , the court fool Touchstone ( a brilliant Alfred Molina ) and Audrey ( Janet McTeer ) , and Sylvius ( Alex Wyndham ) and Phoebe ( Jade Jefferies ) . Brian Blessed plays the roles of both feuding brothers with style and authority , and Kevin Kline offers a fully realized Jaques - the character who is given the most memorable soliloquies in the play . The settings and imagery ( Tim Harvey ) are artistic and beautiful and captured with style by cinematographer Roger Lanser , and as with all of Branagh's production the music score ( here by Patrick Doyle ) is letter perfect and atmospheric . But in the end the kudos go to Kenneth Branagh for his consistent courage and conviction that Shakespeare's plays are timeless , and his devotion to bringing them to the contemporary audience is to be applauded . This is a fine film - one to own ! Grady Harp
513097	3223254	387037	10.0	Fine Ensemble Acting in a Quiet , Powerful Little Film	AURORA BOREALIS is a superb film by James Burke ( ' In Dark Places ' and ' Tis a Gift to Be Simple ' ) from a story by Brent Boyd ( ' The Green Room ' and ' Crazy ' ) and if this film is a sample of how these two fine talents collaborate , we can only hope for more . The cast assembled for this movie gives evidence that the actors deeply admire their vision : it is well deserved . The setting is winter in Minneapolis , the hometown of the Shorter family : Grandfather Ronald ( Donald Sutherland ) , Grandmother Ruth ( Louise Fletcher ) , and the two grandsons Duncan ( Joshua Jackson ) and Jacob ( Steven Pasquale ) . The boys ' father died at age 39 ( 10 years prior to the opening of the story ) and both boys grew up on their own , feeling deserted by a father who had been a cocaine abuser at one time . Duncan had been a champion hockey player , but when his father died his goals diminished and he has been in and out of odd jobs without a solid look at his future . Jacob runs a nursing home business and when he is not working , he is bringing his girlfriends to Duncan's flat for trysts . Duncan cares for his grandfather Ronald who has multiple illnesses ( Parkinson's Disease , dementia ) yet who maintains a humble life with Ruth . As Ronald's condition deteriorates , Duncan takes a handyman's job in the complex where his grandparents live and during this time the two men bond more closely than ever : Ronald's fading mind sees northern lights from his apartment window and Duncan out of love and growing understanding lets him believe they are real . Ronald is aware of his mental instability and lets Duncan know that he would like to take his life with a shotgun , an idea Duncan prevents . Ronald and Ruth have a health care provider Kate ( Juliette Lewis ) whom they trust and love and encourage Duncan to seek out as a partner . Kate and Duncan date and fill the wide gaps in each other's personalities , yet when the opportunity comes for Kate to move to sunny San Diego , she is unable to make Duncan budge from his safe routine existence in Minneapolis . But as Duncan's resistance is broken down ( he learns from a mentor that his father did not die of cocaine abuse , Ronald dies a natural death , etc ) , he views Kate as the person who can alter his outlook and his life . Every member of this cast is extraordinary : Donald Sutherland creates a man eaten by Parkinson's Disease and dementia without ever becoming a caricature , Louise Fletcher reminds us how self-effacing her acting has always been , Juliette Lewis turns in one of her most sensitive roles , and Joshua Jackson finds every nuance of the troubled but needy Duncan and engages our empathy . Each of the smaller rolls is likewise pitch perfect , no doubt due in large part to the sensitive direction of Burke . It is so refreshing to watch a film as meaningful in message and in skillful acting as this , a movie that restores our confidence in film as art . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
512646	3223254	435479	10.0	Conrad , Chéreau , Huppert , Greggory : Exquisite Quartet for GABRIELL	Patrice Chéreau is one of the giants of entertainment , whether in his direction of operas ( his Wagner RING remains a gold standard ) , plays , or his films . He is a thoroughgoing artist , one who combines great intellect with a keen ear for music , camera movement , atmosphere , the spoken and unspoken word , and for accompanying some of the finest actors at work today in their realization of his visions . GABRIELLE is a case in point and for this viewer this is simply one of the strongest films to come out of France - a country much celebrated for its cinematic genius - in many years . Inspired by Joseph Conrad's short story ' The Return ' and adapted as a screenplay by Anne-Louise Trividic and Chéreau , the story is a brief history of a married couple whose ten-year marriage alters in one afternoon and evening - the time span of the film . Jean Hervey ( Pascal Greggory ) is a handsome man of wealth who ' acquired ' a wife Gabrielle ( Isabelle Huppert ) ten years ago . They live in a mausoleum of magnificent art and base their existence on the glamorous parties attended by the artists and patrons of the arts in turn of the century Paris . Jean's ' acquisition ' of Gabrielle included the understanding that they would have no intimacy : they do sleep in the same bedroom but in separate beds . Their marriage seems perfect - but it is hollow . Rather abruptly Gabrielle leaves a note on the dresser addressed to Jean , a note that states she has left him for a man : her need for sexual gratification has risen to the breaking point . Jean is devastated , but as he nurses his broken glass-injured hand Gabrielle returns : she could not go through with ending the marriage of convenience . The two have extended verbal exchanges and physical abuse but it is only to the servants that Gabrielle shares her true feelings . She decides to structure her marriage to Jean by submitting to him sexually , a status that is novel to their marriage , and it is this role reversal of the masculine / feminine state that sends Jean panicked into the night . Chéreau uses many techniques to render this story about intimacy ( or the lack thereof ) that strongly support the power of the film : sections are in black and white representing the way things appear and are structured to the planned observation ; Raina Kabaivanska plays and sings at a soirée ( she is an actual opera star ) ; Jean's staff of servants is only women instead of the usual mix of men and women ; the musical score by the brilliant Italian contemporary composer Fabio Vacchi is used as a ' character ' instead of background support ; and the camera work by cinematographer Eric Gautier uses a full cinemascope camera set up to add weight to the project . But none of these subtleties would have worked so perfectly without the brilliance of acting of Isabelle Huppert and Pascal Greggory . They find the core of these strange characters and allow us to understand the rather warped psyches of the pair . It is a feat of genius . As an added DVD feature there is an extended conversation with Chéreau , Huppert and Greggory about the film from the initial idea to the finished product and hearing these three brilliant artists share their insights is for once extremely additive to the film . This rather dark and brooding film may be a bit too static for some , but for lovers of cinematic art it is a complete triumph to experience . Grady Harp
512872	3223254	332285	10.0	' New Mexico can overwhelm you . . . '	OFF THE MAP is so unique a film that comparisons pale . Adapted from her own play Joan Ackermann has written a screenplay whose main character is the high desert of New Mexico and the magical influence that natural beauty and tranquility of the place has on people . Campbell Scott directs this intimate little story with such tenderness and intelligence that he has created what doubtless will become a cult classic . The time is the early 1970s , and the location is an isolated single home north of Taos owned by a strange family who live on less than $5000 . a year by being at one with the land for its provisions . Charley ( Sam Elliott ) is in a chronically depressive state , unable to speak much and preferring to simply sit in the dark and periodically weep . His resilient wife Arlene ( Joan Allen ) fends for the family , gardening for food and hunting for meat , selling crafts at the periodic fairs in Taos , and caring for her husband . Their daughter Bo ( Valentina de Angelis ) is 11 and not only fully capable of living the life style of her family , but also at the same time longing for the ability to leave home and see the world , a desire she feeds by wisely devising rebates on food purchases , applications for credit cards etc . The family's solid friend is George ( JK Simmons ) who has known Charley since their Korean War days and is fraught with his friend's severe depression . Into this physically gorgeous terrain that is home to this odd family comes an IRS agent William Gibbs ( Jim True-Frost ) sent by his new government boss to collect back taxes from the family who has not seen the necessity to pay taxes on their below modest income . William approaches the house , sees Arlene gardening in the nude , is stung by a bee , and lapses into an allergic reaction , a situation that makes him a patient in the household for some days . Bo is fascinated with this ' man form the outside world ' , Arlene cares for the patient , and Charley quietly opens up to him once William recovers . William's car has been stripped in the desert and he is invited to live with the family until the car is restored . Each of the family members is changed by William's presence , but none more than William himself who undergoes an epiphany viewing the Sangre de Cristo mountains approach sunset : William forsakes his previous life , begins to paint with watercolors George had intended for Charley as a therapeutic venture , and informs Arlene that he has fallen in love with her . The entire group influence each other's lives and the manner in which this happens is such rare magic that saying more in a review would be unfair to those who have yet to experience this film . The entire cast is absolutely superb , so much so that it is impossible to name the Star : Sam Elliott , Joan Allen , Valentina de Angelis , Jim True-Frost , and JK Simmons give stunning performances , the quality of acting that takes full advantage of silences , body language , probing into the characters , and most important - understanding the importance of ensemble acting . Yet if one must name the standout performance , it would be the radiant mystical land of New Mexico as captured by cinematographer Juan Ruiz Anchía . Campbell Scott has directed a great screenplay and cast in one of the best movies of the year . It is a quiet , majestic work of art . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
512835	3223254	477348	10.0	' To this we've come '	Cormac McCarthy's novel NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN has been successfully transformed into a film in the skilled hands of Ethan and Joel Coen . The story is intact , the characters are given the dialog so uniquely McCarthy's invention , and the horror of the message of the book - that we have come to a point in time when crime , especially random murder , surrounds our lives - is , if anything , even more pungent than on the pages of the book . It is an amazing , and a highly disturbing movie , and while this viewer is one of the few who does not believe it deserved the Oscar for Best Picture , there is little doubt that it is a brilliant piece of cinema . The story is fairly simple : on the raw plains of Texas a slaughter of men and dogs engaged in a drug deal is discovered by a simple guy Llewelyn Moss ( Josh Brolin ) . Moss observes the mayhem , sees the drugs , finds the 2 million dollar payoff money , takes the money , and embarks on an escape , leaving his wife Carla ( Kelly Macdonald ) to escape the pursuit of a mad killer Chigurh ( Javier Bardem ) who in turn is being pursued by the local sheriff ( Tommy Lee Jones ) and a hired hit-man ( Woody Harrelson ) . The satchel of money contains a tracking device and Chigurh has the instrument necessary to follow the trail the device leads . The remainder of the film is the pursuit both in Texas and in Mexico , accompanied by countless brutal murders of all sorts by the crazed Chigurh , until a surprise ending . But the toughest part of this violent film is more in the discussion of shared philosophies between the sheriff and his old cronies : they reflect on the sad state of universal crime that is so different and more malevolent than in the ' old days ' . The conversations , in the superb dialog of these old men , bring our attention to some realities we would rather not confront , and those realities are even more disturbing than the repeated images of bloated bodies and senseless murders that fill the screen . Jones , Brolin , and Bardem are indeed superb in their roles , but the small cameos of the townsfolk of Texas are little gems of acting and direction . This is a difficult film to watch because of all of the violence , but the message is one we must heed . We may be allowing the creation of ' no country for any men ' . Grady Harp
513245	3223254	382073	10.0	Serendipity as Chamber Music	Often a film succeeds because of the story , or the writing , or the cast , or the direction . HEIGHTS succeeds brilliantly because of the combination of all of these elements in one of the finest films of the past few years . Beginning with the play and screenplay by Amy Fox , and as carefully and lovingly directed by Chris Terrio with a sterling cast , this film works its subtle magic of a story about serendipity and coincidences and how these alter our lives by accidental occurrences . Or are they accidental ? Each of the well-drawn characters in this story is functioning at a level that involves the masks behind which we each hide our personal secrets or idiosyncrasies : each character is either at a ' height ' or approaching one , and it is the interplay of these disparate people that creates phrases of music which ultimately combine in a series of themes and variations like a well-composed work of chamber music . And this all occurs within a twenty-four hour period in Manhattan . Diana ( Glenn Close ) is the reigning New York actress currently preparing a production of ' Macbeth ' with friend director Henry ( Eric Bagosian ) while simultaneously giving Master Classes at Julliard to a group of acting students who she declares lack passion ! Diana's ' height ' is challenged by her current anxiety over her open-marriage husband's rather serious affair with one of her students . She holds auditions and a young , struggling , and handsome actor Alec ( Jesse Bradford ) catches her interest and she sees in him the passion she craves and invites him to her party that evening . Alec , fearful of his chance at his ' height ' , hesitantly accepts . Meanwhile Diana's photographer daughter Isabel ( Elizabeth Banks ) is fired from her portrait job only to be offered an important gig in Eastern Europe by an ex-lover , offering Isabel a chance at her own ' height ' . Isabel is engaged to young ambitious lawyer Jonathan ( James Marsden remembered for this superb acting in ' The 24th Day ' ) who in preparing to marry a non-Jew is in counseling with his Rabbi ( George Segal ) : there are obviously stresses on the incipient marriage that Jonathan has not revealed . In another area of Manhattan , at Vanity Fair , Liz ( Isabella Rosselini ) taps reporter Peter ( John Light ) to do a story on a famous and gifted photographer known for bedding his nude male models . Peter is to interview each of the models for the story , and one of those models happens to be Jonathan ! The entire group comes together at Diana's party and there the secrets of each of the characters gradually surface in coincidental ways and the story of how each of these interesting but tainted people respond to discoveries makes for the resolution of the story . Director Terrio uses finely honed techniques to slowly introduce each character , adding layers of information gradually , until the magnitude of these coincidences becomes dramatically tense and fascinating . This film is like standing in a darkroom watching a photograph slowly develop , revealing more of the details with each washing , until the final picture is filled with extraordinary details - some expected , others not . The cast is wholly superb and the degree of ensemble acting surpasses that of films of the recent past . If there is a criticism of the film it is a minor one : the ambient sound and musical scoring at times cover the dialog which make us strain to hear the whispered interchanges . But this is a brilliant film that immediately assumes a role in the pantheon of fine cinematic art . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
513573	3223254	454776	10.0	Unsung Heroes sing Amazing Grace	AMAZING GRACE is a beautifully mounted , well-scripted , powerful film that reminds us that there were heroes in the late 1700s who vehemently fought the fight for abolition of slavery . Benefiting from a tight intelligent script by Steven Knight and directed with great sensitivity and fluidity by Michael Apted , the film captures the flavor of the turn of the 18th century into 19th century in England when slavery was a commodity the wealthy could ill afford to lose , and how the courage and perseverance of William Wilberforce created probably one of the first human rights movements on record . William Wilberforce ( Ioan Griffith ) witnessed the horrors of transporting slaves from Africa to be sold around the world to wealthy plantation owners and to serve as cheap and disrespected servants to the British populace . Encouraged by a previous slave dealer John Newton ( Albert Finney ) turned contrite priest , his friend Prime Minister William Pitt ( Benedict Cumberbatch ) , and the informed woman of his life Barbara Spooner ( Romola Garai ) , Wilberforce bonds with a band of abolitionists including Thomas Clarkson ( Rufus Sewell ) and Oloudaqh Equiano ( Youssou N'Dour ) and begins long years of battling for abolition in the Parliament where cads such as Lord Tarleton ( Ciarán Hinds ) and the Duke of Clarence ( Toby Jones ) fight his every word . One of the hallmarks of this fine film is the dignity it sustains : in a film that could have easily focused on depictions of slave abuse to make its point , it instead elects to keep the focus on the heart of the struggle against the inhumanity by subtle yet powerful means . The title of the film , of course , comes form the song the reformed John Newton wrote as he had a life altering experience to end his slave trading to fight for human rights . It is a haunting reminder that is used throughout the film in the score by David Arnold . The cast is uniformly excellent with not only first class performances by each of the leads , but also by superb cameos from such fine artists as Michael Gambon , Nicholas Farrell , Sylvestra Le Touzel , Jeremy Swift , and Stephen Campbell Moore . The atmosphere of both elegance and poverty of London is captured in the cinematography by Remi Adefarasin . This is an epic film with a powerful message that deserves the attention of us all . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
513706	3223254	401085	10.0	A Celebration of Familial Love and Individual Resilience	C . R . A . Z . Y . is a miraculous little film from Quebec written with pitch perfect dialogue by Jean-Marc Vallée and François Boulay , on whose memories of his own experiences the story is based , directed with tremendous zest and sensitivity by Jean-Marc Vallée , and with a cast of fine actors that would be impossible to duplicate . Yes , it really is that fine . The title of the film may put some people off as silly , so let it be said early on that the letters C . R . A . Z . Y . represent the first names of the sons of the Beaulieu family - and the fun , hilarious and touching story starts from there ! Christmas Day is the birth of Zachary Beaulieu ( impressive Marc-André Grondin as a young man and Émile Vallée as a youth ) , the fourth son of Gervais Beaulieu ( a brilliant Michel Côté ) and his seemingly perpetually pregnant wife Laurianne Beaulieu ( Danielle Proulx , a superb actress ) , and at his birth he is immediately dropped on the floor , ' dies ' for a few seconds , and is resuscitated , a fact which later leads his mother to consult her Tupperware friend / seer about Zachary's power from God to heal other people . The children include Raymond who is a boisterous youth and later a worthless drifter / panhandler ( played by Pierre-Luc Brilliant as a young man but also played as a youth by Emmanuel Raymond and Antoine Côté-Potvin ) ; Christian ( Maxime Tremblay as a young man and Jean-Alexandre Létourneau as a youth ; Antoine ( Alex Gravel as a young man and Sébastien Blouin as a youth ; and Yvan ( Félix-Antoine Despatie and Gabriel Lalancette ) . Each brother has a particular personality , whether a bookworm , an athlete , a ne're-do-well or a dreamer and we watch the family adapt to each of the brothers ' idiosyncrasies . But it is Zachary who is the focal point as he struggles with his sexual identity from childhood on through his teenage denial years while dating a girl , to his final longing for the unreachable relationship with a man as an adult . His ' powers ' of healing he uses to great advantage for his family and he gradually becomes disenchanted with the omnipresent Catholic Church , a force that plays heavily in his fantasy life and dreams and fears . As the years pass from 1960 to 1971 we are allow to watch a family connect , fragment and ultimately survive , always bound to traditions of holiday and love . Gervais claims all of the good points of his boys as patterned after him , yet as he faces Zachary's possibly being gay he balks and it is only after a mesmerizing life changing experience Zachary undergoes that Zachary and Gervais finally find the mutual love they have both needed . Though the film is long ( running time is over two hours ) the film seems to fly past us like a comet of experience to which we all can relate . The performances are so very powerful that they sweep us away with the amount of love they exhibit : Danielle Proulx as the mother is so subtle in the little things she does for her beloved though at times wayward sons that she glows and Michel Côté steals the screen as a father searching for understanding of his crew of crazy boys . But the revelation is Marc-André Grondin's embodiment of Zachary that is nothing short of a miracle of acting . There is not a weak moment in this little masterpiece of film-making and one hopes that it will be released and widely publicized in the theaters in the USA as it deserves standing ovations ! Highly recommended . Grady Harp
513419	3223254	408777	10.0	The Idealism of Youth and the Realism of Adulthood : Tempering the Blazes	' Die Fetten Jahre sind vorbei ' or THE EDUKATORS has a message , a message that deals with the ' education ' of the captains of industry by the idealistic socially conscious rebels among the youth AND the ' education ' of those rebellious youths by the world wise / weary hoarders of wealth whose life change resulted from being the rebellious youth of yesteryear . The dichotomy of opinions makes for a thoughtful and thought-provoking diatribe that lifts this film from an action movie into the realm of a psychological ' thriller ' of sorts . Peter ( Stipe Erceg ) and Jan ( Daniel Brühl ) have been close friends for fifteen years , share a flat , and spend their time attacking the corrupt society in which they resentfully find themselves by breaking in to wealthy peoples homes while the owners are away , rearranging all the furniture and leaving notes that inform them their days of lifestyle are doomed . They do not steal or damage : their acts are political and philosophical statements . Jan is the more idealistic of the two and also the more reclusive . Peter is gregarious and finds a live-in girlfriend Jule ( Julia Jentsch ) who slowly becomes attracted to Jan , more for bonding than for Peter's physical emphasis . Jule confesses to Jan that the reason she cannot accompany the good-hearted Peter on a trip to Spain is that she is deeply in debt , the result of an accident in her old car with a new Mercedes belonging to an older wealthy man Hardenburg ( Burghart Klaußner ) who is making Jule pay him the 100 , 000 Euros the car cost him . Jule is complying but is resentful that a man of wealth is so money conscious that he has overlooked the fact that his demands have made her life intolerable . When Jule is informed of Peter's and Jan's night capers , she suggests the trio make Hardenburg's home their next ploy . The result of a bluster , the trio is discovered by Hardenburg and they opt to kidnap him to prevent their going to jail . Retreating to a country cabin the now ' quartet ' slowly come to understand each other , with Hardenburg confessing that in his youth he too was a hippie and a member of a similarly socially conscious gang . He reminisces and gains the trio's respect , is instrumental in revealing the fact the what he believes is a ménage a trois is in reality a changing of partners for Jule , preferring Jan to Peter . How this new information alters the plans of the kidnapping and its resolution is the climax of the film and accompanies some surprises best left to the individual viewer's enjoyment . The actors are uniformly excellent : Daniel Brühl is rapidly growing into a very fine actor and Julia Jentsch is most assuredly a new actor to watch . The film gets a bit long in the tooth for the static situation of the final half , but the impact of the ending rescues the story from any flaws it may have had . Director Hans Weingartner understands the fine line between message films and entertaining movies and succeeds briskly with this one . THE EDUKATORS leaves us with food for thought no matter the age group - current rebels or aged rebels ! Highly recommended . Grady Harp
512787	3223254	322674	10.0	Twin Views of Altered Lives : A Triumphant Film	DE TWEELING ( TWIN SISTERS ) , based on the highly successful novel by Tessa de Loo and adapted brilliantly for the screen by Marieke van der Pol , is assuredly one of the most touching films to date about the strength of family bonds decimated by the horrors of WW II . Director Ben Sombogaart follows Dutch writer de Loo's lead in making this story about the differing fates of twin girls separated at the death of their parents more of a parallel tale than capitalizing on the grim reality of Hitler's influence . The result is a cinematically magnificent , gently hued verismo style of film that succeeds even more in its impact than if it were constantly doused in the dark side of its subject . Germany 1920 . Lotte Bamberg ( played by three actresses though a long life - child Julia Koopmans , young woman Thekla Reuten and aged woman Ellen Vogel ) and Anna Bamberg ( child Sina Richardt , young woman Nadja Uhl and aged woman Gudrun Okras ) are inseparable twins at age six , living life to its fullest until suddenly both parents are gone and they are split up : the consumptive Lotte goes to live with her upper class Dutch aunt in Holland and the healthy Anna remains in Germany with her poor uncle on a pig farm . Lotte lives a life of privilege , recovers form tuberculosis , studies German at University and sings Schumann ( ' Frauen Lieben und Leben ' appropriately ! ) accompanied by her soon to be husband David ( Jeroen Spitzenberger ) who happens to be Jewish . As the war threatens Hitler's invasion on Holland , David is sent to Auschwitz and brokenhearted Lotte marries David's kind brother and has a child . Meanwhile Anna leads an abused life on the poor and filthy farm , is beaten by her heinous uncle when she begins dating a young handsome Austrian Martin ( Roman Knizka ) and runs away to work as a maid . Martin believes in Socialism and joins Hitler's army , and is killed . Throughout the years of separation each twin writes to the other but their guardians for varying reasons never mail the letters . Anna finally finds Lotte and they have a brief time together in Lotte's elegant surroundings . But when Anna observes German dinner guests berating Jews she flees . The two sisters find it difficult to separate the losses of their husbands : Lotte blames Anna's siding with the Nazis as a cause of David's death . Anna defends Martin's role as one of idealism that had nothing to do with the genocide of the Jews . They part , seemingly to never meet again . But as old women bedraggled Anna seeks out the elegant Lotte and the two come to understand their opposite opinions of what the war did to destroy their happiness . The entire cast is so fine that it is difficult to single any one actor out for distinction : this is truly ensemble acting . Never pushing the story to the edge of saccharine or excess of war violence , director Sombogaart keeps his focus on the dialogue between the sisters central , embroidered with the opposing dichotomies of class and political commitment visceral but understated . The cinematography of Piotr Kukla and the radiant musical score by Fons Merkies are astonishingly effective . This is one of the powerful movies about the Holocaust from an entirely different stance - one that grabs you by the heart and holds on for the 135 minutes of the film . . . and beyond . In Dutch , German and English with subtitles . Very Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
513405	3223254	331811	10.0	An Absolutely Fascinating Little Film	Greg Marcks offers us in ' 11 : 14 ' that rare breed of film that keeps us on the edge of our seats for the entire 95 minutes running time . This strangely wonderful tale embraces the ideas of consequences and serendipity by unraveling a story of two deaths that affect the lives of eight kids and two parents , each with separate perceptions of shared incidents , and all of those perceptions intertwine in the most unique way imaginable . This is not a teen horror flick , not an attempt to do an imitation cheap movie life ' Blair Witch Project ' look-alikes . ' 11 : 14 ' is simply a fine script played with comedy and tragedy and wide-eyed wonderment by a top notch cast of actors . To relate the tale would to defray the anxiety Marcks creates in his writing . It is sufficient to say that little nerdy people in a small town somewhere are all caught up in two deaths , a thwarted robbery , a case of missing bodies , and a final core explanation of how the whole foolish mess got started . Along the way there are hilarious moments of accidental death during intercourse in a grave yard , a severed penis and its impact on hit and run kids , a rather randy and hormone driven trashy girl whose parents get caught up in the scheme of things . . . and that is only starters . The exceptional cast includes Hilary Swank ( with braces ) , Patrick Swayze ( with body padding ) , Barbara Hershey obsessed with opera , Rachel Leigh Cook as the promiscuous round robin girl , Henry Thomas as a drunk driver , Ben Foster as the genital loser , Blake Heron , Shawn Hatosy , Blake Heron , Stark Sands , Colin Hanks , and Gregg Clark as the revolving police officer who tries to keep up and make sense of the mess . The cinematography is beautifully handled by Shane Hurlbut who manages to keep the nighttime ambiance all centered on the 11 : 14 PM restrictions of the action . But above all it is the brilliant script and tight direction by Marcks that makes this the strong , grossly overlooked sleeper of a movie that it is . It just has everything ! Grady Harp , October 05
513182	3223254	386651	10.0	The Magnificence of Man's Bond with Animals and the Perpetuation of Life	' Kekelixi ' ( ' Mountain Patrol ' ) is one of those quiet , quasi-documentary films that now and then rises out of nowhere and has such an impact on the viewer that it has the potential for creating some global change action . Written and directed by Chuan Lu from China and sponsored in part by National Geographic the film was distributed as ' travel / foreign places / environmental issues ' product , and while it satisfies those designations , it resonates as a story that is not only based on fact , but one that opens our eyes to another way of life in a very remote area . The effect is stunning . A journalist from Beijing - Ga Yu ( Zhang Lei ) - travels to Tibet to investigate the poaching of Tibetan antelope and the group of unpaid citizens committed to eradicating the poachers and saving their beloved antelope . The leader of the mountain patrol is Ri Tai ( Duobuji ) and he has gathered devoted men who spend their lives selflessly searching for the elusive poachers . Ga Yu goes along for the search , camera in hand , capturing the magnificence of the mountains of Tibet , the men's camaraderie and commitment to their mission , and the fields of antelope carcasses left behind by the poachers whose only concern is to skin the antelope for their pelts of luxurious wool for the world market . The patrol encounters endless problems with their equipment , food supplies , loss of men to the poachers ' guns , and finally capture a group of men ( a family ) who serve as skinners for the pelts . Ri Tai attempts to remain fair and non-violent , but his attempts are constantly thwarted . Ga Yu changes from a journalist role to a committed hunter and his relationship with Ri Tai and the other patrolmen is exceedingly touching . The ending of the film is as quiet as the Tibetan landscape and equally as impactful . The cast is not known to this viewer , but it is difficult to imagine that Duobuji and Zhang Lei are amateur actors , so profoundly moving are their performances . The haunting music by Lao Zai and the breathtaking cinematography by Yu Cao support Chuan Lu's film . This art piece is excellent on many levels and is one that deserves a large audience . Highly recommended .
513639	3223254	424136	10.0	A Tightly Written , Directed and Acted Controversial Thriller	HARD CANDY is one of those films that took enormous courage on the part of the writer ( Brian Nelson ) , director ( David Slade ) , and producers - let alone the actors - to bring a tale of pedophilia to the mainstream audience . Made for a small budget ( yet the production values are so very artistic that it feels like an expensive film ) , HARD CANDY is essentially a duet for two actors : the actors Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson deliver performances that become indelibly burned on the mind of the viewer . 32-year old photographer Jeff has been chatting online with 14-year old Haley for three weeks using standard chat room seduction lines . They meet , talk , seem to get along well - until Haley invites herself to Jeff's home , much against Jeff's better judgment . Once home the beautiful space in which Jeff lives ( the set decor is splendid , using sensitive colors in a cinematic way ) , the walls adorned with photographs of young models , seems a fitting space for a fine photographer . But soon the twist of the story explodes and Haley lets Jeff know that she is there to punish him for his pedophilia and for some specific events in his history . She drugs him , and when he awakens Jeff is the captive , forced to undergo the intensive questioning and innuendos from Haley , including being set up for castration . The tension mounts to a peak as the two characters uncover aspects of each other ; the final resolution of the long encounter comes as a stunning surprise . The quality of the film is so fine that no judgments are made : is Jeff truly a criminal pedophile ? , is Haley insane ? , can this reversal of roles happen ? The script is so beautifully written that it remains intelligent and straight , forcing the viewer to become involved in the quest for truth . Ellen Page delivers a brilliant performance as Haley and Patrick Wilson steps out of his usual milk toast roles to create a man driven by strange needs who gradually comes to a point of self acceptance in one of the more powerful scenes of film this viewer has seen . The audience for this examination of pedophilia may be small and therein lies the pity . This is a film that deals with a tough subject so very well that the viewer gains an understanding into dysfunctional characteristics while being caught up in a suspenseful thriller of a story . This is independent film making at its best .
513201	3223254	978759	10.0	Popcorn and Tang and Other Evidences of Desperation	FROZEN RIVER marks an impressive debut for writer / director Courtney Hunt : here is a filmmaker that not only knows how to weave a powerful story with pacing that rarely takes a break for breathing , but one who also knows how to pull intensely dramatic performances from actors in that rarest arena of ensemble acting . Though many viewers may avoid this film because of its suggestion of uncompromising sadness and depression in a time when ' escape movies ' seem to draw the larger audiences , simply giving into this story will offer insights into human behavior - from adults and children , from minority groups , and from the disenfranchised - that allow the ending of the story to resonate subtly and memorably . Ray Eddy ( Melissa Leo ) lives with her two sons , teenager T . J . ( the gifted young Charlie McDermott ) and 5-year-old Ricky ( James Reilly ) , in a shabby trailer house in the icy tundra where New York state meets Canada adjacent to a Mohawk Indian reservation . Ray's gambling addicted husband has deserted his family with the money being saved for a better , larger trailer house , and Ray is left to forge for her boys at her menial job , living paycheck to paycheck and forced to feed her children popcorn and Tang for meals . To make ends meet she attempts to find her missing husband and instead encounters his car as stolen by young Mohawk Lila ( Misty Upham ) . Their confrontation leads to Ray and Lila partnering in smuggling immigrants ( Chinese and Pakistani ) from Canada to the US via drives across the frozen St . Lawrence river . How these two disparate women find common threads under desperate circumstances provides the bulk of this amazingly rich story . Hunt manages to explore poverty , the displaced American Indian situation , smuggling , State Trooper mentality , and the extraordinary manner in which children left to their own parent-less devices manage to stay above sinking with such skill that the incredible story being told seems like across the fence conversation - it is that real . The entire cast is exceptional , not only Leo and Upham , but all of the actors in even the smallest roles . This is a film to embrace , not avoid , as it speaks to the indomitable human spirit .

513321	3223254	443680	10.0	An Homage to Western History in a Moody Daguerreotype Style	THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD is one of the finer films about the history of the Old West ' heroes ' such as Jesse James . It is difficult to describe the degree of high quality of the way in which this film has been created : the script ( adapted by Andrew Dominick from Ron Hansen's novel ) is as poetic as it is gritty and flows like a Shakespearean tragedy both in narration and in dialog ; the exceptionally fine cinematography by Roger Deakins captures the flavor of the times , shot in subtle lighting whether in darkly intimate interiors or on the vast plains at times heightened by snowlight , but always in the feeling of the quality of daguerreotypes ; the musical score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is strangely apropos without seeming to borrow from any previous source ; and the cast of fine actors play the film as a true ensemble work . Director Andrew Dominik has accomplished a masterpiece . The story begins subtly in the last year of the James gang at the final train robbery in 1881 . Jesse James ( Brad Pitt ) and his brother Frank ( Sam Shepard ) have gathered remnant criminals to bolster their decimated gang - Dick Liddel ( Paul Schneider ) , Ed Miller ( Garret Dillahunt ) , and Wood Hite ( Jeremy Renner ) among them . The Ford brothers want to ride with Jesse : 19-year old Robert ( Casey Affleck ) idolizes Jesse and his older brother Charley ( Sam Rockwell ) enjoys the attention of the gang's fame . Jesse James , at only age 34 , is at the end of his career , content to be at home with his wife Zee ( Mary Louise Parker ) and children . But Robert's adoration results in a chain of events that slowly dissembles the gang and results in Robert's obsessive revenge for Jesse's murder of one of the members fired by the promise of reward for the capture of Jesse James , dead or alive . History and the title of the film tell the plot so there are no surprises here . It is the inevitable unfolding of the drama and the tension of the interplay of the actors that drives the mood of the story . The film does not stop with the killing of Jesse James but instead follows the descent of the lives of Robert ( now wealthy and in love a stripper - Zooey Deschanel ) and the progressing insanity of Charley to an end that fades like the proverbial sunset on a time in our history we will never forget . Each of the actors is exceptional , and despite the glory of having big name stars associated with the cast , the effect is one of pure ensemble work . The 160 minute running time of the film never seems too long , so well timed is the pacing of the story and the pauses for understanding the interior aspects of each character's mind . This is a haunting film , unusually fine in every detail . It deserves , and demands , attention . Grady Harp
513366	3223254	381850	10.0	A Truly Valiant Film Providing an Inside Look at Cuba Today	Director Antonio Cano is a brave artist , the class of filmmaker who is willing to take risks for the sake of his art . SIETE DIAS , SIETE NOCHES takes a frank and brutal look at one week in Cuba , primarily in Havana , where Cano follows the lives of several women under the kind of stress those of us in this country can only suppose . He does not preach , he does not fall into one side or the other of propaganda : he simply has written and filmed a story that lets us see how people living in Cuba cope . The film opens with a woman TV news anchor Norma Fernandez reciting the news with a tear in her eye and , unable to continue reporting the lies of the government , she weeps , pulls off her wig , and runs form the studio , pledging a life of silence . At the same time in another section of the country a peasant woman Maria loses her young son in a bizarre situation that could be construed as infanticide . Devastated , she leaves her home to move to the street life in Havana for isolation and survival . In yet another area one elegantly thin and beautiful woman Nieves reluctantly carries out her means of livelihood by killing pigs in a slaughter , all the while dreaming of being a cabaret dancer . Her attitude results in her losing her job and in her mother throwing her out of her meager flat that has been home . Cano uses these three women as primary focus and works these desperate lives into a fabric that intertwines like a vast mural of decay , lost hope , dog fights , cock fights , sexual encounters , multiple lullabies , and descents into madness , and humor and dancing and , above all , the eternal hope that tomorrow will bring a better life . This is brutal realism , beautifully captured on film by a group of gifted actors , among them Ingrid Gonzalez , Ludmila Alonso-Yodu , Mercedes Morales , Erudye Munuz , Orsiel Gaspar , Alcedes Alvarez to name only a few . The impact of this film is powerful : it will take multiple viewings to realize all of the intricacies of the plot and the interactions of the characters , young and old , with the government and the culture of Cuba . This is one of those films that deserves a wide audience for those who are concerned about the lives of people who live under suppressive regimes . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
513628	3223254	1078188	10.0	Living with the Sins of Childhood	BOY A is a film that moves the audience in ways few other films do . Part of this is the subject matter , part the solid drama of the novel by Jonathan Trigell on which Mark O'Rowe based his brilliantly understated screenplay , part the sensitive direction by John Crowley , and in large part is the cast of remarkably fine actors who make this impossibly treacherous story credible . ' Boy A ' refers to Eric Wilson ( Alfie Owen ) who was jailed for a crime with his friend with whom he was associated as a youth . He has been released from prison and under the guidance of his ' parole officer / adviser ' Terry ( Peter Mullan ) , the now young adult is renamed Jack Burridge ( Andrew Garfield ) to protect him from the public who still remember the heinous crime of which he was convicted : Terry warns Jack to tell no one his real identity . Jack is assigned a new family and finds new friends in this strange world outside prison walls , but he is still haunted by the crime that changed his life . How Jack relates to his first female relationship and survives the bigotry of his classmates and city folk and finds a way to hold onto life despite his childhood ' sins ' forms the development of this story . While the entire cast is excellent , Andrew Garfield's performance as the guilt ridden needy Eric / Jack is exemplary . There are many issues this film deals with in addition to the trauma of starting life over after imprisonment , issues that are universal in nature and that probe our psyches for answers that are never easily resolved here . It is a brilliant little film from Canada . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
513272	3223254	420901	10.0	A Powerful , Deeply Moving Examination of the Rwanda Genocide of 1994	To acknowledge the fact that genocides are still active in our supposedly enlightened times is terrifying , yet through films such as BEYOND THE GATES , HOTEL RWANDA , and SOMETIMES IN APRIL we are gradually bring informed about one particular genocide - that occurred in 1994 in Rwanda - and hopefully will make us as a global population more proactive in stemming the possibility of further acts of brutality and disregard of humanity . Writer David Wolstencroft and director Michael Caton-Jones have created one of the most powerfully poignant films about the genocide of the Tsutsi people by the Hutu people and by placing the film exactly where the genocide happened have added an intensely compelling atmosphere to an act that never should have happened . In 1994 , at the Ecole Technique Officielle , a school for the Rwandan children run by Europeans under the tutelage of Father Christopher ( John Hurt ) and with idealistic teachers such as the young Joe ( Hugh Dancy ) , the incipient intertribal rioting between the Hutus and Tsutsis is ' monitored by the impotent United Nations led by Capitaine Delon ( Dominique Horwitz ) . After the current leader of Rwanda is shot down in a helicopter tragedy , the Hutus begin killing the Tsutsi , butchering them with machetes and leaving the bodies to rot in the streets . The Tsutsis flock to the Ecole , looking for asylum and protection , and Father Christopher and Joe do everything in their power to provide food and shelter and safety . One particularly gifted student Marie ( Claire-Hope Ashitey ) works closely with the two men , gaining their admiration and love , and representing the desperate need of the Tsutsis . The UN forces refuse to fire on the invading Hutus and finally evacuate all white Europeans to be flow to safety out of Africa . It is this final abandonment of the Tsutsis that underlies the ensuing slaughter of those who sought help within the Ecole walls . And with showing the decimated Tsutsis the film ends with a few follow-up scenes that are deeply touching and immensely disturbing . It is clear that the film reveals how the world ignored the tragic genocide of 1994 and a more poignant statement has rarely been captured in writing , filming , direction , and acting . John Hurt and Hugh Dancy are brilliant in their roles , but it is the performance of young Claire-Hope Ashitey that rivets our attention : she is a wonder of an actress and deserves awards for her intensely realistic performance . The film's story is already known ( hopefully ) so there can be no spoilers here . And therein lies the agonizing reality that the world stood by and let this happen . Every world citizen should be required to see this powerful film in hopes that such atrocities will be prevented in the future . But then there is now Darfur . . . . . Grady Harp
512670	3223254	974554	10.0	Dignity and Sensuality : Intoxication	' When you make love to a woman you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life . ' Few American writers have been able to examine the fear and rage and desperation of aging as eloquently as Philip Roth , and as with another of his novels brought to life on the screen ( ' The Human Stain ' ) , here Nicholas Meyer has beautifully adapted Roth's ' The Dying Animal ' with all the visceral immediacy and poetry of the novel about the terror and compassion of May / December relationships . Isabel Coixnet has managed to guide her gifted set of actors through this story as though it were a ballet . The result is one of the more beautiful ' love stories ' ever filmed . David Kepesh ( Ben Kingsley , in a performance of tremendous power and sensitivity ) is an aging author , teacher and art critic , a man who has not learned the secret of lasting relationships but who retains his animal sex drive despite his passing years : he survives time's passing by a patterned assignation with Carolyn ( Patricia Clarkson ) , an aging successful traveling business woman who drops in for sensual gratification when in town . David's closest friend is Pulitzer prize winning poet George O'Hearn ( Dennis Hopper ) who serves as his alter ego and as his confidant in David's problematic life . Into David's classroom comes Consuela Castillo ( the ravishingly beautiful and gifted Penélope Cruz ) who gains David's focus not only for her radiant beauty but also for her intelligence . Struggling with his advanced years ( David is over thirty years older than Consuela ) , a courtship dance begins and it is the emergence of this romance that forms the story . How Consuela alters David's behavior and his discovery of the need for connection outside of the bedroom is related as a journey through David's mind . The manner in which the transformation changes every member of the story is what makes this film so very memorable . Kingsley is brilliant in this probing examination of the aging man's psyche , Cruz SHOULD have received her Oscar for this performance rather than the film that honored her , Clarkson continues to be one of our best actresses on the screen , Peter Sarsgaard makes a brief but important appearance , and David Hopper manages to step out of his predictable past roles and offer a character of true compassion and finesse . The film is magnificently photographed ( Jean-Claude Larrieu ) and the music score thankfully is almost completely devoted to the works of Erik Satie ( Gnossiennes ) , Beethoven ( Diabelli Variations ) , Vivaldi ( cantatas with Phillipe Jaroussky ) - all edited by the director Isabel Coixnet . It all works well . This is one of the finer films of 2008 and deserves a wide audience of people who love quality film-making . Grady Harp
513197	3223254	323807	10.0	The Inner Sanctum of Family , The Durability of Love	RECORDATI DI ME is a beautifully written and constructed film by Italian director Gabriele Muccino about the workings of a ' normal middle class ' family and the bonds and challenges that peak at the time of fragmentation of the family unit that accompanies 1 ) middle age of the parents and 2 ) departure of the children at the end of high school . How those crises and adjustments inform the durability of the family unit makes up this thoroughly engrossing and touching film . Carlo Ristuccia ( Fabrizio Bentivoglio ) is the father embedded in a life long job that is mundane and not at all in line with his dreams of being a writer ( he has been writing a novel for years , yet unfinished ) . His wife Giulia ( Laura Morante ) is a committed mother but longs to return to the acting stage she abandoned for marriage . Their two children are Valentina ( Nicolette Romanoff ) who is determined to become a glamorous TV star and Paolo ( Silvio Muccino ) who is aimless in his desire for a life of meaning , a life which would prove he is not as unexceptional as he views himself . Gradually each member of the family encounters escape routes : Carlo meets his old girlfriend Alessia ( Monica Bellucci ) and begins an affair with her ; Giulia is asked to audition for a part in a play directed by one Alfredo ( Gabriele Lavia ) who makes her feel desirable and noticed ; Valentina sleeps around to land a part in a TV giveaway show ' Ali Babbi ' , and Paolo attempts to attach himself to a girlfriend by planning a birthday party with contraband hashish which he feels will make him appear important in the eyes of his peers . As each of these crises reaches a peek , Carlo sustains a back injury while fleeing his home and his resultant hospitalization results in altered perceptions of what the family is all about . The twists and turns of the plot are , of course , far more involved than this short synopsis , and it is the development of each of these characters and the way that they approach change that makes the film work so well . The acting is excellent and the direction is past paced even for a two and a half hour movie . Yes , much of this has been said before , but the wit and pathos combine to create a story well worth telling and watching . It is a story about dreams , lost possibilities , and the need to fulfill them .
513548	3223254	436697	10.0	Helen Mirren Creates Another Triumph !	THE QUEEN seems like one of those biographical features that would be difficult to hold anyone's interest - on the surface , without the benefit of knowing much about the content . Queen Elizabeth II is not exactly a figure who generates anything but a response of boredom , so flat and uninteresting is her persona . But enter Helen Mirren , one of the finest actresses on the screen today , and this potentially boring potentate becomes a vibrantly detailed and fascinating portrait of a queen at odds with the times . It is a staggering achievement . Director Stephen Frears , using a superb script by Peter Morgan , details the time from the election of Labor Party Prime Minister Tony Blair ( a brilliant Michael Sheen ) to that momentous international outpouring of grief and love that followed the tragic death of Princess Di in 1997 , showing the bifurcation of response between the Royals and the People as represented by Blair . Instead of the insensitive cold figure that the world witnessed as QE II , Mirren shows us that the woman who is Queen actually had feelings for her grandchildren , a respect for her station as royalty , and was gradually responsive to the cry of the people via Blair's influence , allowing the world to pay proper tribute to a heroine . The ogres in the Balmoral Castle were in fact Prince Phillip ( James Cromwell ) and the Queen Mum ( Sylvia Syms ) abetted by the very proper Robin Janvrin ( Roger Allam ) and the wishy washy Prince Charles ( Alex Jennings ) . The entire production is beautifully filmed with the use of clips from Princess Di's life ( and death ) instead of creating an actress role to portray her - a very wise choice . The musical score by Alexandre Desplat is superb ( with a little help from Verdi's ' Libera Me ' as sung by Lynn Dawson and the BBC chorus for the funeral portion ) . But indeed the accolades go to Helen Mirren in an Oscar worthy performance - with the very strong counterbalance by Michael Sheen . An excellent film about a moment no one will ever forget .

513420	3223254	428803	10.0	The Sacrifices of Procreation and the Timeless Dignity of the Emperor Penguins	As a moment of respite and perspective in a world cluttered with tribal warfare , human responses to natural disasters , and the garish flames of politics , MARCH OF THE PENGUINS reminds us of the eternal cycle of life , life perpetuated against all manner of foes and odds , and helps us re-center our blurring focus . This eloquently beautiful film , a documentary that goes well beyond the genre limitations , is a work of art by Director Luc Jacquet and his fearless crew of photographers , and as art should , it brings a subject into focus that reminds us of the space each organism occupies with dignity on this troubled planet . The story is simple yet profound : the Antarctica Emperor penguins yearly march from the sea to the breeding grounds , mate monogamously , procreate , the females leave their egg with the fathers and return to the sea for food , returning to nourish the new chicks , relieving the fathers to make their food trek to the sea , returning to relieve the mothers who depart for food only to return and conjointly raise their newborns , then make the sacrifice of leaving the chicks to mature and plop into the sea to begin the whole cycle again . These elegant and warmly humorous birds endure the outer extremes of nature all for the sake of nurturing their progeny . The cycle is fascinating in its centuries old repetition of ritual and wonderfully pertinent to the re-evaluating the human family unit ! The photography is magnificent , finding not only the intimacy of the penguins , but the rapture of the frigid sea where they dive impossible depths for foods , and also the majesty of the Antarctica complete with ' Southern lights ' . This film is a work of magic and happily can be shared with all generations , each segment from the very young to the very elderly will find a special message . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
513107	3223254	421229	10.0	Love : Meeting the Needs of the Aged and the Youthful	MRS . PALFREY AT THE CLAREMONT is an adaptation by Ruth Sacks of the book by British novelist Elizabeth Taylor ( 1912 - 1975 ) and directed with consummate skill by Dan Ireland . It is a showcase for the extraordinary talents of Dame Joan Plowright who owns the title role and of relative newcomer Rupert Friend , surely an actor to watch rise . Mrs . Palfrey ( Plowright ) is recently widowed and decides to move to a small hotel in London to spend her last years as a lady of independence . The Claremont is a crumbling old edifice that serves as a retirement home for a small but fascinating group of tenants : the fastidious but cranky Mrs . Arbuthnot ( Anna Massey ) , a would-be suitor for Mrs . Palfrey's hand Mr . Osborne ( Robert Lang ) , Mrs . Post ( Marcia Warren ) , the nosy matchmaker Mrs . Burton ( Georgina Hale ) , and a strange old couple , the De Salises ( Millicent Martin and Michael Culkin ) . Once settled into her barely navigable room , Mrs . Palfrey meets her fellow ' inmates ' at dinner , and announces that she has a grandson who will be calling on her at times . Yet despite multiple attempts her grandson Desmond ( Lorcan O'Toole ) doesn't respond and Mrs . Palfrey realizes she has entered a world of loneliness . Out on an errand she falls and is befriended by a handsome young busker / writer Ludovic Meyer ( Rupert Friend ) who nurses her leg wound , makes her tea , and escorts her home . Ludo is a loner and lonely and when Mrs . Palfrey offers him dinner at the hotel he gladly accepts . But at the hotel the guests presume that Mrs . Palfrey's guest will be her grandson Desmond : Mrs . Palfrey hastily informs Ludo that she has erred and Ludo agrees to pose as her grandson . The guests at the hotel are charmed by Ludo , and Mrs . Palfrey and Ludo grow increasingly bonded - they share many likes and tastes and meld into a beautiful relationship that would be the envy of any grandmother and grandson . Mrs . Palfrey's loneliness is dissipated by Ludo and the effect is vice versa . How the two progress to the end of the film , finding new lives from old ones , forms the immensely touching finale to the film . Though this film falls into the ' ensemble acting ' category , so finely entwined are the performances of every actor in the cast , the film clearly belongs to Dame Joan Plowright whose performance once again proves that she is one of the durable treasures of cinema and stage . This is a film that will touch the hearts of even the most hardened viewers and this viewer cannot recommend it more highly . Grady Harp , December 06
513074	3223254	834938	10.0	A Powerful Story About Immigrant Journeys	SANGRE DE MI SANGRE ( also known as PADRE NUESTRO ) is a fast-paced , raw , and rather brutal indictment against the cruelty immigrants face upon entering this country . Written and directed by Christopher Zalla the film may cover territory becoming a bit overexposed in cinema of late , but the story is so well told and acted that it rises to the top of the films currently available about the experiences immigrants ( from Mexico , in this case ) endure in trying to better their lives under the torch of the Statue of Liberty ! The film opens in Mexico where a young criminal Juan ( Armando Hernández ) narrowly escapes his pursuers by jumping over the border fence and landing in a situation where a coyote ( corrupt border guard ) is loading his truck with immigrants to transport them for cash to New York . The street-wise Juan is one of many stuffed into a truck and happens to sit by a young illiterate lad his age named Pedro ( Jorge Adrián Espíndola ) who is on his way to meet his father who lives in New York ( ' a man who owns a restaurant ' ) but whom Pedro has never seen ( he carries with him a letter to his father from his recently deceased mother ) . Through all manner of staging errors and transportation glitches , the two young boys , full of dreams of a better future in America , land in New York . Juan loses his money and his ID and steels from his newfound friend . Pedro encounters a streetwalker named Magda ( Paola Mendoza ) who promises to help Pedro find his father Diego ( Jesús Ochoa ) . But Jaun has found the dishwasher Diego first , claims to be his son , and causes confusion and discord in Diego's life . How the two lads manage to survive the complexities of life in Brooklyn and are swept up in the raw life of crime that surrounds the lives of illegal immigrants makes for a complicated story , but one filled with unforgettable characters and emotions . This film had an unfortunately brief run in the theaters . It is a well-made film in every aspect and deserves wider audience which now , on DVD , it just may reach . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
