513579	3223254	283742	2.0	Nice scenery but . . .	' Inspiración ' isn't . For those who have the patience to sit through this Mexican extended novella , discovering that other countries are capable of producing the kind of summer chick flick messes that Hollywood cranks out ad infinitum will be the surprising reward . Written and directed by Angel Mario Huerta and starring a group of Mexican TV actors , ' Inspiración ' has little to recommend it . A group of Macho guys ( supposedly teenagers although all of the actors are obviously aged well beyond that ! ) with little on their minds except dating , doing the club scene , sporting wagers about girls as though the girls were game-things for goals , spur on the naive Gabriel ( Arath de la Torre ) to pursue a beauty he merely glimpses and gets a first name Alejandra ( Bárbara Mori ) . Gabriel in ' inspired ' to write poetry ( not a pastime appropriate to macho men . . . ) in response to Alejandra , has a confrontation with his father that begins with the usual flair of son not living up to father ideals and ends with a complete reversal of tears and forgiveness . . . , and is rigged into assignation with his ' inspiration ' . Each move Gabriel makes to woo Alejandra results in disaster in situations intended to be humorous but that are really just gross or silly . It is the old , tired story of boy meets girl , boy falls all over himself to impress , girl initially responds but is gradually repulsed by boy's insipid arrogance and behavior , boy looses hold on girl , and eventually boy gets girl . Yes , that is it ! The acting is almost as weak as the script and direction and while some of the actors are attractive people , they have no sense of comedy or love chemistry or charisma . The film is overproduced , with more emphasis on décolletage than on character development , and in the end the only saving grace is seeing Monterey , Mexico and surrounding areas to advantage . Definitely a class B movie that probably should not have been exported . 92 long minutes in length and in Spanish with English subtitles . Grady Harp
513250	3223254	301771	2.0	Rent a Husband Italian Style	' Mariti in affitto ' ( ' Our Italian Husband ' ) is sort of a mess of a movie . Ilaria Borrelli wrote and directed this bilingual film and apparently lost track of her story during the making of it . The Italian language portions are supplemented by English subtitles , but the English , when spoken , is so distorted by the actors and by the musical sound track that the words are nearly incomprehensible . What results is a slapstick comedy acted way over the top to the point of frustration on the part of the audience . The action opens somewhere in Italy where Maria Scocozza ( Maria Grazia Cucinotta ) is eking out a living making sandals to support her two children from her marriage to artist Vincenzo Scocozza ( Pierfrancesco Favino ) who left for America some years ago to make it big in New York . Maria is courted by older gentlemen who threaten her to the point that she leaves with her two children to fly to New York to re-join her husband . Upon arrival she finds an unfriendly country but no husband and is befriended by Raul ( Diego Serrano ) who eventually finds her work passing out fliers for an agency called ' Rent a Husband ' . She eventually discovers her husband has remarried to TV model Charlene ( Brooke Shields ) who is extremely pregnant . Outraged but with no place to go , Maria and her two children move in with Charlene and Vincenzo , and as predicted the two women eventually join to plot against the two-timing Vincenzo . . . etc etc etc . The acting is raw - Chevy Chase even has a role as a TV writer - and the performances all border on overacting . There is a hint that somewhere in this mélange of ideas there are some solid humanistic points to be made , but everything gets lost in the mess of a production . Not a very good way to spend an evening .
513000	3223254	252266	2.0	A Used Story , Used Production Techniques : A Tired Movie	BEEPER is the product of those films that deal with kidnapping of a child with the only connection with the perpetrators being by cell phone or other mechanical devices supposedly to enhance the tension of identifying the bad guy . By now the story is so used and tired that it takes a spectacular gimmick to make it fly . BEEPER remains grounded . Dr . Richard Avery ( Ed Quinn , known to only those who watch TV ) flies to India with his young son ( he is a widower ) to give a lecture at a worldwide medical conference . In the audience the son Sam ( Stefan Djordjevic ) disappears and the good doctor notices too late , beginning a long series of chases to find Sam . Avery encounters Sr . Inspector Vijay Kumar ( Gulshan Grover ) , whose specialty is drug dealing problems , and Inspector Julia Hyde ( Joey Lauren Adams ) , whose specialty is kidnapping . But Avery is informed that he is to follow instructions given through a beeper and to avoid the police . Avery finds his only source of information is through Zolo ( Harvey Keitel ) , a drug lord in Delhi who has special interests in fulfilling the ransom : cash for opium . After an endless car chase through the streets and markets of Delhi the truth about who is the real kidnapper is revealed . . . and the movie glides to a bumpy end . Seeing India as a backdrop for an intrigue film is promising but visually this viewer gets the feeling that much of the footage is actually from a can rather than being on set . The acting ranges from fair to really awful and the script by Michael Cordell and Gregory Gieras is dreary . Made in 2002 and just released on DVD it is not a secret why the movie didn't make it in the theaters . Even the usually reliable Keitel can't save this one . Grady Harp
512976	3223254	285175	2.0	Havoc it is	If there is some justice to misjudging investments in movies , then the fact that this film went directly to DVD despite the presence of a crew that includes some impressive names is notable . Writer Stephen Gaghan ( ' Traffic ' , ' Rules of Engagement ' , ' Syriana ' , etc ) has composed a contrived script about rich , bored , Hip Hop imitating , unmotivated teenagers trying to spice up their insignificant lives by treading into the East LA ' danger zone ' , an experience from which they learn nothing about cross cultural ethnic groups and just return to Pacific Palisades whining about ' damaged goods ' . It is an insulting story , one that stereotypes Hispanics as drug-peddling , raping thugs in a totally black and white manner , not taking into consideration the viewpoint of a cultural group's positive attributes and philosophies . No longer a viable gimmick , the film begins with the tired cliché of a kid making a documentary about his friends , asking what they like and don't like , their goals , their outlooks . The fact that none of the interviewees has a clue about life , preferring to follow the current Hip Hop language ( very poorly written ) and focusing on sex , drugs , and escapes from their wealthy environments . Among these are three girls , the main character being Allison ( Anne Hathaway , miscast in every way ) , who follow their superficial boyfriends on a joyride for drugs into East LA . There they meet Hector ( Freddy Rodríguez , trying his best to create a character without the benefit of a decent script ) who sells them drugs and whom Allison eyes . Allison is so shallow she doesn't have a clue about her motivations , just wanting something ' dangerous ' to happen . She coaxes her equally clueless girlfriends into going into East LA to seduce Hector and ends up in a ridiculous barter for joining Hector's gang ( no mention is made at all about the Chicanas who would never allow these three geeks to enter their territory unchallenged ) . The results of a barter results in an experience with which the girls cannot cope so they run back to the protection of the dysfunctional parents they loathe to cover the mess of their caper . Attempts to resolve this dumb story fail pathetically . With so many fine Indie films that go begging for attention , it is a shame money is wasted on this sort of meaningless mess of a film . The ' unrated ' designation is probably meant for the occasional nudity and gratuitous sex and language , but here ' Unrated ' might just mean that the film is so without merit that it is non-classifiable . Avoid this one and don't think that a fine writer such as Gaghan guarantees a successful story . Grady Harp
512805	3223254	320159	2.0	Perhaps this was made as an Aussie Vendetta . . . . ?	ALL THE WAY ( aka THE NIGHT WE CALLED IT A DAY ) is a docudrama of sorts : it is based on a true incident that happened in Australia in 1974 and still is grumbled about today . Why this flimsy film was made in the first place seems only due to lasting resentments on the part of the Australians at the arrogant and crude behavior of Frank Sinatra when he made an appearance in Sydney during a world tour : he insulted the press , caused the labor unions to react in defiance by cordoning off his connection to the world outside his darkened hotel suite and demanded an apology from the star , an act that Sinatra refused to do . Writers Peter Clifton and Michael Thomas have attempted to make this boring incident viable by revealing the background events and characters surrounding the event . They have created Rod Blue ( Joel Edgerton ) as a failing show promoter who puts all his money and future into assuring the house for the concert . Australia loved Sinatra : this seemed his ticket to ride . Frank Sinatra ( Dennis Hopper playing Dennis Hopper ) arrives and one of the Press who alienates Sinatra is Rod's girl Hillary ( Portia di Rossi ) and when she asks inappropriate questions , Sinatra calls her a hooker and there begins the furor of the Aussies . The people are incensed at Sinatra's foul mouth and insensitivity and boycott the concert . The Labor Unions , representing the people of Australia , strike so that Sinatra is trapped in his hotel without light , water , food , room service , etc . Rod Blue's surefire scheme seems destined to fail . Sinatra is accompanied by his squad of hefty goons and his current paramour Barbara Marx ( Melanie Griffith ) and it is Barbara who intervenes and helps salvage the situation . She encourages Rod's mousy assistant Audrey ( Rose Byrne ) to believe in Rod whom she secretly loves and coerces Sinatra into negotiations with the people he has offended . Yes , it all works out in the end - Sinatra does his concert , Rod makes money and the audience appears satisfied and enthusiastic . Sound like a fairly boring film ? Well , it is . It is partially saved by the entertainment of watching Hopper lip sync Sinatra songs as sung by Tom Burlinson , by Edgerton's commitment to make his hero Rod a credible human being , and by seeing Melanie Griffith looking terrific in beautiful gowns . Otherwise , despite the casts ' best efforts , this is a forgettable film .
513025	3223254	460887	2.0	Pass on this Takeoff on Horror Films	Jason Paul Collum both wrote and directed this little film that resembles a gay ' Fatal Attraction ' without the benefit of a tight script , good actors , suspense , or sophisticated effects and camera work . Sadly it boils down to a fifteen-minute story spread out over an almost interminable 2 hours . The story involves on Corin ( Sean Michael Lambrecht ) , a 30-year old ad exec in a five-year bumpy relationship with 23-year old party boy Jake ( Jeff Dylan Graham ) . Corin's boss and friend Nancy ( Brinke Stevens ) understands Corin all too well , appreciates his relationship , but in attempting to relieve his work duties hires an assistant Elliot ( Jerod Howard ) , a gender confused nerdy lad who is engaged to his lifelong chum Marti ( Tina Ona Paukstelis ) in a push from his mother ( Judith O'Dea ) to make things ' right ' . Elliot is befriended by Corin , brought into Corin's and Jake's friendship , and Elliot and Marti and Corin and Jake begin socializing . Elliot falls for Corin , comes out of the closet to the extreme dismay of Marti and his mother , and despite Elliot's friendship with Corin and Jake , he begins to stalk Corin . Corin's rebuff of his advances leads to disaster and the film tumbles downhill from there . Yes , some may view this weak little foray as being full of statements about love , obsession , relationships , and friendships , but all of that has been said far better before and without the seemingly tacked on genre of a horror film . The acting from the women in the film is good , but the men are blunted stereotypes . Everything about the film screams low budget . One annoying factor - a music score that sounds like lessons on electronic keyboards and obscures a lot of the dialogue - turns out to be a blessing in that the weak script is covered frequently . Most viewers will utilize the fast forward button to get through the repetitious dialogue and race for the end , a predictable , stagy tableaux that really doesn't resolve anything . Not worth two hours of your viewing time .
512912	3223254	810077	3.0	An Idea That Never Takes Flight	THE UNTOUCHABLE requires patience on the part of the viewer - patience to stay with this sullen , dark and clunky film to the end only to discover the wait was not worth the patience ! Writer / director Benoît Jacquot had a good idea : trace the search for a biological father to a country foreign to the seeker . What results instead of a journey of self-discovery is a travelogue to India as captured by a hand held camera with what appears to be a minuscule budget . Jeanne ( Isild Le Besco ) discovers on her eighteenth birthday that her mother ( Bérangère Bonvoisin ) conceived her on the banks of the Ganges River in India with an Indian man who remains unknown . Furious at her mother's secret and feeling the profound need to connect with her biological father , Jeanne , an actress , leaves her acting workshop to make a racy film in order to make enough money to travel to India . Once in India she searches for traces of her father without success . But the search is not without some interest for the viewer : the hand held camera that follows her through the airport and the countryside and to Benares ( that city by the Ganges where the dead are cremated in elaborate fashion and the living bathe in the waters of the holy river ) . She gathers clues as to her father's identity from friendly strangers , but alas , the riddle remains unsolved . Isild Le Besco is in practically every frame of this film and she indeed is an interesting actress to watch . But the lack of intelligent dialogue prevents this film from revealing motivations or character development , opting instead for a static ( and rather poorly edited and scored ) glance at the mysteries of India . For those interested in watching in detail the preparation of bodies for cremation and the slow act of that ritual , this is a film worth watching . For the casual viewer it is tedious . Grady Harp
513618	3223254	454987	4.0	Revenge on the Rocks with a Twist of Comedy !	There are ' chick flicks ' and there are ' guy flicks ' and LET'S GO TO PRISON definitely falls into the latter category . Adapted from a novel ' You Are Going to Prison ' by Jim Hogshire by screenwriters Ben Garant , Thomas Lennon and Michael Patrick Jann and directed by Bob Odenkirk , this light film seems to be a ' boys night out ' venture and should be viewed with a heavy dose of good humor . John Lyshitski ( a hunky and very funny Dax Shepard ) has a rotten childhood , having been caught in funky ' crimes ' always facing the courtroom of on Judge Biederman ( David Darlow ) who consistently sentences him to time in reform school then prison . After multiple terms behind bars Lyshitski seeks revenge on the judge only to discover the judge has died ! BUT the judge left a cocky son as heir - Nelson Biederman IV ( Will Arnett ) - and Lyshitski stalks him and ultimately is able to get Nelson locked up in prison , and then manages to get himself locked up simultaneously to be Nelson's cell mate . The point of the caper is to put Nelson through the cruel events of prison life , but as the two live in the same cell , Lyshitski's best ideas for revenge and backfire , leaving the once terrified Nelson in the hands of a Black gang leader Barry ( Chi McBride ) with whom Nelson ultimately bonds and thwarts all the plans for revenge that Lyshitski penned . The ending is a funny twist of events that is good for a chuckle as well as lesson about guy bonding . The film is no great shakes of a movie , but made on an obviously low budget it does benefit from the antics of the three excellent leads and the result is a ' different kind of prison movie ' that is light , silly , and entertaining .

512801	3223254	273517	4.0	Maybe we're just not supposed to understand the occult world	DARKNESS is a movie struggling under the burden of an impossibly puerile script . Had the writer Fernando de Felipe and director / writer Jaume Balagueró taken a bit more time to develop the underlying basis for this Gothic suspense excursion into night they may have had a stronger result . As it is the reasons for all of the occult intervention in a strange house somewhere in Spain comes in bits and pieces and ultimately seem barely interesting and silly . Mark ( Iain Glen ) , his wife Maria ( Lena Olin ) and their two children Regina ( Anna Paquin ) and Paul ( Stephan Enquist ) move into an old house unoccupied for forty years , a house that has problematic electricity and water and odd sounds that go bump in the night . The family's doctor / grandfather Albert Rua ( Giancarlo Giannini ) appears at times when the family needs support and in this new home those times proliferate . Mark is afflicted with a disease called ' Harrington Syndrome ' which causes episodes of wild behavior supposedly controlled by meds which nurse wife Maria administers . Paul is the most frightened or sensitive to the bizarre occurrences that happen only in the dark : he gains strange bruises , sees darkened children , notices movements and other nocturnal scaries . Regina is the comfort to Paul and believes the ' delusions ' his father and mother deny and seeks help from a local lad Carlos ( Fele Martínez ) who researches the house and discovers that it was built by an architect ( a man who stalks the house at night ) who informs Carlos that the house was built for strange reasons : a ritual occurred forty years ago involving the death of six children ( meant to be seven but one escaped ) . It is only with the death of that seventh child at the hands of one who loves him that the curse will be lifted . Yes , this is really the tale . . . how this disintegrating family comes to grips with the dark history and demands of the house and who is to be the seventh ' child ' is the gist of the story . Had the writers given us more perhaps we would care more , but with so many threads of unexplained twists and turns the suspense fails to peak . The actors , having such poor material from which to work , stumble through the tale without gaining our concern or support . The saving grace of this outing is in the moody cinematography by Xavi Giménez : the look of the film is excellent enough to justify simply turning off the sound track to allow your imagination to make a story out of the visuals . And to add insult to injury the closing lines of this unresolved ' story ' seem to open the door for a sequel , heaven forbid ! Grady Harp
513398	3223254	426615	4.0	Usher is a bright presence on the screen	IN THE MIX is a fairly routine Hollywood gig on mixing spinning with mob crime sidebars and interracial relationships . It isn't a great movie but it does give Usher a chance to strut his stuff in a remarkably subdued and charismatic fashion . Darrell ( Usher ) is a spinner in a club , a start at a dream of owning his own recording industry . He is asked to spin discs for the surprise birthday party of law student Dolly ( Emmanuelle Chriqui ) , the wealthy daughter of crime boss Frank ( Chazz Palminteri ) . Darrell and Frank have been friends a long time having shared parental tragedies : there is also a chemistry in the making between the time reunited Darrell and ' engaged ' Dolly . An attempt is made on Frank's life and Darrell bravely takes the bullet . Frank assigns Darrell as Dolly's bodyguard and through a series of assassination attempts and crime busts Darrell and Dolly are drawn closer . How Frank deals with this new ' development ' as well as coping with the opposing mobsters plays out the fairly obvious story . Usher has presence and despite the fact that he is not given screen time for his dancing , he is given ample time as eye candy and as an actor who deals well with both comedy and action . His interaction with Chriqui is palpably on target . The remainder of the cast do what they can with a weak script , but director Ron Underwood keeps the action and reaction going at an entertaining pace . This is not a great movie , but it is entertaining and introduces Usher to the screen in a well-prepared debut . Grady Harp
513348	3223254	475984	5.0	Bright Moments in a Patchy Film	MISTER LONELY is that sort of film that pleads to be loved . It has an original concept for a plot , it takes many visual and surreal chances , and it is populated with a lovable cast who seem to be having fun with the process . Harmony Korine both wrote ( with Avi Korine ) and directed this pastiche about people who , frustrated with reality , live their lives as impersonators of famous people . When it works it is delightful : when it gets bogged down with a self-conscious script it falls flat . ' Mister Lonely ' ( beautifully depicted in the opening sequences under the credits as a child who cannot be what he is told to be ) is a young man who takes on the persona of Michael Jackson ( Diego Luna ) , performing dance movements on the streets of Paris as a busker . He encounters a like person who lives impersonating Marilyn Monroe ( Samantha Morton ) and before long the two are off to a Highlands commune in Scotland , populated with full time impersonators such as a foul-mouthed Abraham Lincoln ( Richard Strange ) , Charlie Chaplin ( Denis Lavant ) , The Pope ( James Fox ) , Father Umbrillo ( Werner Herzog ) , Sammy Davis , Jr . ( Jason Pennycooke ) , the current Queen Elizabeth ( Anita Palenberg ) , Little Red Riding Hood ( Rachel Korine ) , James Dean ( Joseph Morgan ) , Madonna ( Melita Morgan ) , and flying nuns among others . The story is less a plot than a celebration touched with a bit a angst of how the unnoticed people in the world find a source of belonging by embracing imagination . The film is choppy and loses some of its potential allure from the editing . The cinematography by Marcel Zyskind captures some truly beautiful moments and the musical score by Jason Spaceman with the Sun City Girls adds a lyrical air to this surreal romp . For lovers of Harmony Korine this movie will please . For viewers with limited attention spans ( running time is 112 minutes ) the film begs indulgence . Grady Harp
513142	3223254	287914	5.0	A Moody Bit of Sicilian Life and Crime	Italian director Roberta Torre co-wrote with Massimo D'Anolfi this little film based on a true story of an incident in 1984 Sicily that revealed the integration of home life with crime in a quietly subtle way . Expect no major crime scenes ( with one exception ) and don't look for a THE SOPRANOS spin-off and the film will entertain because it is an honest attempt to demonstrate how passion can upset even the most controlled crime syndicate . Angela ( the very beautiful Donatella Finocchiaro ) is married to Rosario ' Saro ' Parlagreco ( Mario Pupella ) , a shoe store owner in Palermo where Angela works - not only selling shoes but also selling drugs in a very cleverly devised crime syndicate run by her husband . Saro gives her jewels and money and all the things that are supposed to make a wife happy . But when Angela's interest in the business / drug trafficking wanes , Saro brings on handsome Masino ( Andrea Di Stefano ) to brighten the scene . The police are watching the operation , attempting to capture evidence to shut down the drug business . When Angela and Masino begin a rather torrid affair the police photograph their liaisons and this leads to the destruction of the shoe store drug business . The entire group is jailed with Angela and Manino being released on house arrest . But when Saro is informed by the police of his wife's infidelity the theme becomes operatic and the resolution of the true story is typical Sicilian drama . The movie is slight , short , in Italian with English subtitles , and is well wroth watching for the pleasure of Donatella Finocchiaro's presence . It is fascinating to see how even a small drug operation can have such impact on a real family . Grady Harp
512859	3223254	360032	5.0	A Bit of Aussie Humor and Tongue in Cheek	STRANGE BEDFELLOWS is one of those films that plays like a TV sitcom without the canned laughter - especially now that gay themed shows have made it big on television . This film's main charm is its Aussie flavor and that forgives a lot of the shortcomings of a fluffy idea of a script . Essentially , two men ( Paul Hogan and Michael Caton ) decide to avoid back taxes and take advantage of a new law that allows same sex partners to gain the rights of married couples by passing as a gay married couple . How they go about convincing each other that they can pass as gay in order to convince the authorities and then how they can learn to act gay and live a gay life to back up their story is the action of the movie . Many stereotypes are included but somehow the Aussies know how to pull this off with minimal offense . The overall theme , after the story is all said and done , is one of tolerance and compassion for people who are in different societal climes . Hogan and Caton pull this off well , showing how really everyone they meet in their charade is just a ' regular guy ' - and for that reason the film becomes more tolerable than the usual farces that deal with ' passing ' . Not a great movie , but one with a wink ! Grady Harp
513094	3223254	418294	5.0	Worthwhile and Important Story Hampered by Poor Script and Production	THE VIRGIN OF JUAREZ is based on true events surrounding the crime problems of Juarez , Mexico reflected in the gringo exploitation of businesses in neighboring El Paso , Texas . The story contains many important facts that desperately need to be brought into the light , but the impact of the film falters because of the choices made by the writer and director . Karina Danes ( Minnie Driver ) is a journalist for a Los Angeles newspaper who has flown to Juarez to investigate the multiple ( in the hundreds ) killings of young women . The targets for these murders seem to be young women working in the US sponsored sweatshops in Juarez who are picked up at night after work , raped , beaten and killed . Danes is convinced the Juarez police force is doing nothing and takes on the mission of exposing the tragedies , in part due to her own past issues of being to idle with similar crimes in the US . She meets Father Herrera ( Esai Morales ) and a community activist Patrick ( Angus MacFadyen ) and together they probe the police files and follow the most recent murder , discovering along the way a survivor named Mariela ( Ana Claudia Talancón ) , a frightened young girl whose memory of her rape and beating is erased by her apparent vision of the Virgin Mary . A father of one of the victims , Isidro ( Jorge Cervera , Jr . ) nurtures Mariela and helps her to escape the hospital , placing her in a ' church ' where she becomes a ' saint ' to the people of Juarez who long for the crimes to end . Mariela appears to the public with the stigmata of bleeding hands and offers hope to the victims ' families . Danes works hard to discover evidence that will expose the perpetrators , taking a sheet of photos of ' most wanted men ' from the police office of Detective Lauro ( Jacob Vargas ) , and works with the police and Father Herrera to resolve the tragic chain of events that continue in Juarez . Fearing for Mariela's life , they transport her to Los Angeles where mysterious events end the story . The squeaky , mawkish script was written by Michael Fallon and directed by Kevin James Dobson . Had their vision been more directed toward defining the line between realism and fanaticism , the story would possibly have been better related . There are some good performances by Driver , Talancón , Morales , and Vargas but the minor roles vary in quality . Reporting atrocities such as the one this film addresses is a valid and valuable contribution of contemporary cinema . It is sad when script and the production dull the impact . Grady Harp
512771	3223254	826600	5.0	Love , Relationships , and Trials	PHOENIX is the third feature by Michael D . Akers as a director and writer ( here sharing the credits with Sandon Berg ) and as with his other two features ' Matrimonium ' and ' Gone , But Not Forgotten ' there is a sense that Akers knows how to tell a good story , a story based on universal themes but just happening to be using gay characters to explain a similarity in all manners of love whether they be straight or gay . LVN Dylan ( Chad Bartley ) is celebrating his 23rd birthday by setting his apartment with flowers and dinner , expecting his love of one year to arrive for the surprise . The love is Ken ( Gaetano Jones ) who arrives late and barely notices the setting , giving Dylan a clay vase as a gift and then telling him he must dash off to Phoenix for a failing real estate deal . Dylan is hurt then angry and breaks his gift , sending Ken off to Phoenix in a miff . Sorry for his behavior Dylan takes the money enclosed in a Birthday card from his folks and flies to Phoenix to apologize to Ken . But surprises arise in Phoenix : Ken is missing , Dylan traces the broken vase to discover chef / ceramist Demetrius ( Jeff Castle ) and learns that Ken and Demetrius have been partnered for seven years ! Neither Dylan nor Demetrius is pleased with Ken's lying and cheating but they gradually admit to finding solace with each other and spend time together , including a physical encounter that leads to others as the two prolong Dylan's stay . How the love triangle is broken but remains influential is the resolution of the story . Akers has the sensitivity to not make the story have the happy-wappy Hollywood ending : he also has the talent to capture love encounters in a very sensual way . The actors are all attractive men and given the lack of prior experience each has had , they offer fairly strong performances - especially Chad Bartley . The film is desperately in need of editing as there are extraneous scenes galore ( the landscape scenes are far to brightly sun drenched for the desert locales captured . But in the end the film is successful in that it does present the joys , trials , and disappointments in love relationships in the gay community that could have easily been in a straight character movie - and that is refreshing !

512820	3223254	477071	5.0	Piecing the Puzzle Together	Relative newcomers , writer Bill Kelly and director Mennan Yapo , have concocted a testy little conundrum of a movie titled PREMONITION : whether the audience decides to step into their little nightmare or reject the premise that powerful emotions can drive the brain to peculiar directions of functioning will be the divisive break in acceptance of the film's premise . It is a fairly well done , thought provoking experience and is carried by some better than average performances by a strong cast . The Hanson family is introduced as the husband Jim ( Julian McMahon ) and wife Linda ( Sandra Bullock ) buy their new home . Jump forward after the credits to a family that now includes two young schoolgirls ( Shyann McClure and Courtney Taylor Burness ) , a seemingly mildly depressed Linda and a workaholic Jim . Abruptly , Linda is informed by a police officer that Jim has died in an auto accident and her close friend ( Nia Long ) and mother ( Irene Ziegler ) help Linda through the early moments of the tragedy . Yet Linda continues to ' relive ' moments : one day Jim is dead the next he is alive , and all of the pieces of the puzzle that erode Linda's mind become clues to investigate information she doesn't want to know . She encounters a warped psychiatrist ( Peter Stormare ) and a possible ' other woman ' in Jim's life ( Amber Valletta ) , and as she attempts to mold the puzzle pieces to make sense , she learns about the possible ' why ' of the mental state in which she is trapped . The film has problems holding credibility , but then the premise is a novel enough to allow such missteps . Sandra Bullock takes over this role completely , gains our empathy , and in the end the film works because of her . She is becoming an actress who is learning the value of understatement and that aspect of her craft serves her well . No , this is not a great movie , but it is a well-produced little mystery that asks the audience to engage both mind and imagination , and that is a good thing ! Grady Harp
513143	3223254	371739	5.0	Waiting for the Other Zodiac on DV	While ZODIAC is in the theaters and people want a sneak preview of what to expect from that film with Jake Gyllenhaal , this little version called THE ZODIAC is available and has some merit . The search for the still unknown serial killer of the late 1960s in the bay area is a creepy enough story that it is difficult to imagine a telling of it would not make us shiver . This film directed by Alexander Bulkley and written with the director's brother Kelley Bulkeley ( sic ) keeps a fairly low key and while it does manage to depict some of the slayings , much of this version on the Zodiac killer is focused on the personalities of those desperately seeking the perpetrator . Justin Chambers portrays Inspector Matt Parish who becomes obsessed with the search to the point of excessive drinking and neglecting his family ; the manner in which Bulkley depicts him seems more focused on Parish's chain smoking than anything else , an example of using the cigarette as a constant prop when there is no apparent reason for pushing the habit into the public's eye . Parish's frightened wife is ably portrayed by Robin Tunney , and his son who is obsessed with the multiple fascinating aspects of the Zodiac mentality is well handled by Rory Culkin . Some fine actors flesh out the cast - William Mapother , Philip Baker Hall - but they are given little material to use . The production values ( night atmosphere especially ) are strong for an Indie and the film does convey a creepiness that lingers . If only the writers would have shared some insights into the characters on screen the film would have been far stronger . But for another look at Zodiac , until the real one comes out on DVD , this little film is a good teaser . Grady Harp

There are some good one-liners in the film , with a script that is so peppered with the ' f ' word that it is crippled by it , but the story has been done before and much better and this time around the ' twist ' is obvious from the film's opening lines . Goofus-doofus Midwesterner Jaime ( Brendan Fraser ) has moved form Ohio to New York with his gorgeous girlfriend Belisa ( Amber Valletta ) to join a sales company whose chief salesman is foul mouthed , ill tempered Ted ( Michael Keaton ) who appears to loathe everyone and the world .

Ted falls for Belisa and begins to change his outlook , confiding his inner spirit as a professor of English literature to Belisa . A transformation takes place and as Jaime spirals downward while Ted and Belisa's affair ignites , role reversal happens as a not at all surprising plot unfolds . Michael Keaton is a fine actor and makes the best of this mouthy role , but Brendan Fraser's talents are completely wasted - a hint from the start that all is not as it appears . . . It is a mediocre movie and even if the audience doesn't turn off the soundtrack to rid the script of the trashy language , it can become insulting to the intellect . But again , Keaton helps it float . Grady Harp
513059	3223254	374506	5.0	A Cute and Witty Story is Buried by the Chic Trappings	ARISAN ( The Gathering ) is a fine little story about the ins and outs of Jakarta's wealthy class - sort of an Indonesian Beverly Hills 90210 / Melrose Place sitcom . The characters include frustrated wives , jealous wives , career women , cheating husbands , man-hunter girls , and two gay men - one closeted and one open . The film explores the social dictates of society and the jumbled events that occur when family or friends try to match make . The cast is young and attractive and handles the material well . The problem with the film is the emphasis on clothes , fancy homes , cars , and all the trappings of the wealthy class . An ' arisan ' is a gathering where friends come together , pitch in $100 . each and pass the hostessing around to various locales where their main conversation is fairly shallow gossiping . But this film , though drowning in the over-the-top trappings , has many sensitive issues well discussed and played . For a film from Indonesia it is a terrific change from the usual horror flicks that originate from their studios and as such bodes well for a new movie industry that obviously has the ability to become important . It is funny , tender , very colorful and entertaining : some judicious editing could have pared this overly long movie into a fine little film . In Indonesian and English with subtitles . Grady Harp
512899	3223254	427969	6.0	' Nobody ever asks to be happy later . '	HOLLYWOODLAND is a very long ( two hours plus ) film noir that is actually a film khaki : the droning muted brown to ochre tones of the film itself match the story well - and that is not necessarily a compliment . The ' unresolved ' death of B-grade actor George Reeves who was disconsolate at having his crowning achievement be the Superman role ( my , how times have changed ! ) is the subject of this story as written by Paul Bernbaum ( best known for his ongoing ' Halloweentown ' series ) and directed by Allen Coulter whose credentials as a TV director are impressive . With a cast of top-notch actors this should have been a surefire hit , but somehow being unable to care about any of the characters in the film makes it leaden . Though the film takes place in 1959 ( the death by suicide vs possible homicide ) the action spreads into the early 50s as Reeves ( Ben Affleck ) stumbles up the rickety Hollywood ladder of minor roles , alcohol and carousing until he meets aging Toni Mannix ( Diane Lane ) whose marriage of convenience to super producer Eddie Mannix ( Bob Hoskins ) leads to his attaining the role of Superman and the accompanying position of being Toni's lover . The story weaves rather aimlessly through Reeves ' checkered life with paramour Leonore Lemmon ( Robin Tunney ) and influences from well-meaning supporters . But while we watch this rather tepid Hollywood wannabe climb we are escorted by the investigation of his death by one Louis Simo ( Adrien Brody ) who has been hired by Reeves ' mother Helen Bessolo ( the always fine Lois Smith ) to prove that her ' brilliant actor ' son was murdered . The suicide death of Reeves is an open and shut case with the LAPD until Simo tinkers with the evidence , all the while ignoring his rather smarmy career as a private investigation , a distraction which leads to its own dire consequences . Simo also encounters problems with his ex-wife Laurie ( Molly Parker ) and his young son disillusioned that Superman would kill himself . The facts of Reeves ' life parallel with the facts of Simo's life and the manner in which Coulter works with this data places past with present , Reeves with Simo in tightly connected frames so that we never know whose is coming into the next dark space : it becomes a bit tedious and confusing , but in the end it is all bleak and disjointed . The actors try hard to salvage this film and there are some good performances here . But for this viewer it is just a long khaki song that never reaches the chorus . Grady Harp
512758	3223254	414951	6.0	A Different Kind of Story : Musings After the Fact	THE QUIET comes to the big screen then back to DVD as the product of a group of television writers Abdi Nazemian and Micah Schraft and director ( Jamie Babbit ) and the film has the feeling that it would have fared better in a made for television format . It is not a film without merit - the cast is good , the atmosphere created is well captured by good camera people , the twist in the story survives - but something is missing that keeps it flat . The Deers are a family with means whose generosity extends to taking in the victim of another family disaster : the troubles that hide in the Deer family far overpower the problems brought to the unit by the new member . Dot ( Camilla Belle of When a Stranger Calls , Chumscrubber , The Ballad of Jack and Rose ) is accepted into the Deer household when her deaf father dies in a freak accident : her mother died when Dot was seven and from that time to the present she has been newly deaf and mute . She is a loner , preferring to live in her own apparently silent world , finding solace in playing Beethoven piano works ( the actress actually plays the works ! ) . Her ' sister ' is high school cheerleader , foul mouthed , crabby Nina ( Elisha Cuthbert ) who barely tolerates Dot's new role in the house and at school . Olivia Deer ( Edi Falco , always excellent ) is an interior designer mother who buries her disappointments in pills , being emotionally unavailable most of the time . Paul Deer ( Martin Donovan ) is a successful architect whose apparent kindness masks a man who is having an incestuous relationship with his daughter Nina . Dot lets the audience know early on that she is indeed not deaf or mute but elects to maintain her silence as she overhears Nina's plan to kill her father . The manner in which these two girls eventually bond and accomplish the dastardly deed and the surprising ending of the family's dissolution make up the basis for the plot development . Taken on the basis of the story alone the film is fairly predictable , but it is after the movie is over that in retrospect we recognize how cleverly the writers and director and actors have shown us the fragility of each character : each is not black and white / good and evil but in a misty gray zone , a general statement for just about everyone who is in the cast ( Connor the walking failure boyfriend - Shawn Ashmore , Michelle the rowdy slutty girlfriend - Katy Mixon ) . And it is this tendency to encourage the audience to ponder introspection that takes it to a higher level . It is to everyone's credit that they have taken on a tale that is bravely controversial and make it work as well as it does . Grady Harp
512723	3223254	826711	6.0	An Extemporaneous Homage to Albert Lamorisse's THE RED BALLOON	Somewhere the highly regarded Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-Hsien had the idea of paying homage to the 1956 classic Albert Lamorisse film THE RED BALLOON , a tender story of a child's interaction with a nearly animate floating balloon , and while there is indeed an short introduction of a small boy addressing an errant red balloon floating in Paris , the ' homage ' stops there . What follows is an overly long , frustratingly impromptu series of scenes that lack cohesion and resolution . THE FLIGHT OF THE RED BALLOON ( Le Voyage du balloon rouge ) is a prolonged ( 113 minutes ) series of scenes that stutter along with the same sort of wandering course of the occasionally visible red balloon to present moments in the life of a disheveled , frumpy , single mother Suzanne ( Juliette Binoche ) whose income depends on her fascination and obsession with Chinese marionette presentations for which she supplies the backstage voice for all of the characters . Her absent ' husband / boyfriend ' has left her to write in Montreal while Suzanne must care for her young son Simon ( Simon Iteanu ) with the help of a newly hired Taiwanese photographer nanny Song ( Fang Song ) while her daughter resides in Brussels . This disheveled household is further complicated by the freeloading Marc ( Hippolyte Girardot ) , the friend of her absentee ' husband ' , by Simon's piano lessons taught by Anna ( Anna Sigalevitch ) , and by impossible conflicting schedules for marionette performances , partially relieved by Song's quiet ability to take Simon on adventures outside the confines of the cluttered little space they all call home . The only quieting element of this film is the occasional appearance of the ' guardian angel ' red balloon , which seems to be a symbol for defining the real world of Simon and the illusory world he craves . The dialogue as written by Hou and François Margolin is choppy and the camera work and constant meandering piano music seem extemporaneous : there are few resolutions to the individual stories that are only hinted . Juliette Binoche is a solid actress able to make the most of a minimal script and horrendous costuming and makeup : her moments of being the voice of marionettes are magical . But this Red Balloon just doesn't take flight in the context of this homage . As with the rest of the film the balloon just floats off at the end . The viewer needs a lot of patience with this film !

512712	3223254	455857	6.0	High Adrenaline in a Nifty House	Director Simon West ( Lara Croft : Tomb Raider , The General's Daughter , Con Air ) seems bent on settling for an unrelenting stream of tension and terror in this little film WHEN A STRANGER CALLS . He selected a cast of actors who , while they are not big box office names , each arrives with a fine resume of work before the camera . The production matters in this film take focus and for those who enjoy the ' terror in the night ' genre of movies , this one will probably satisfy . Camilla Belle is Jill Johnson , a high school girl on parental probation for over use of her cell phone , etc . who is forced to accept a last minute baby sitting job instead of attending her High School Bonfire party . Driven by her father to the palatial , designer home on the lake of the Mandrakis family , she is amazed at the high tech status of the home - lights that turn on when you enter a room , pools of Koi with intermittent artificial rain piped in , security system and multiple phones . Her assigned children are asleep and she makes herself at home - until the telephone rings . This opens the story of a stranger who calls , says little , but terrifies Jill and eventually is revealed as a serial killer . The rest is easily predictable . Relying far too heavily on the absurdly moody music score by James Dooley for effect , the film doesn't give us enough character development to make it too involving . But that probably isn't the point here . There is a vast audience for the constant flow of scary movies , and as far as movies of that ilk goes , this one is well done . The cast , again , won't ring bells as far as name recognition , but they are a strong group . Grady Harp
513304	3223254	455805	6.0	Bonding : Necessities and Consequences	In a featurette on the DVD release version of THEN SHE FOUND ME writer ( with Alice Arlen and Victor Levin ) / producer / director Helen Hunt shares a ten year journey to have a film made of a novel by Elinor Lipman . Her cast shares in the very sentimental story of Hunt's devotion and seemingly endless charisma and abilities . The explanation for making this budget film are in many ways more successful than the film , a work the cast seems determined to classify as a comedy but a work that is far more a human drama . April Epner ( Helen Hunt ) is married to fellow schoolteacher Ben Green ( Matthew Broderick ) and longs to have a baby before her advancing age prevents her dream . April was adopted as an infant by a Jewish couple who subsequently gave birth to April's brother Freddy ( Ben Shenkman ) : April has always longed to have been Freddy's biological equal , wondering what it would feel like NOT to be adopted . April's busy life implodes : Ben has decided he doesn't like his life and leaves April , April's mother dies , April meets Frank ( Colin Firth ) a recently divorced writer and father of two children , and April is contacted by a man who can put April in touch with her birth mother - popular TV talk show hostess Bernice Graves ( Bette Midler ) . And if these turns of events weren't traumatic enough , April discovers that she has become pregnant by Ben and Ben is unsure whether he can handle the restructuring of his life to accommodate April . Cautiously April and Frank begin a rather tenuous courtship which is almost immediately threatened by April's discovery of her pregnant state . April and Bernice meet , exchange backgrounds , and make pacts to test their biologic relationship . How each of these characters makes promises that eventually damage each other and then resolve in unexpected ways becomes a study of the meaning of love and compassion among fragile human beings . While not a satisfying story on every level and a film too cluttered with inconvenient editing choices , the cast is strong and obviously committed , and the story ( neither a comedy or a drama but a mixture of the two ) tests credibility . But there are some fine moments and the lessons in human behavior are worth examining . Not a great movie but a strong little small budget film . Grady Harp
512923	3223254	462396	7.0	Toga Epic , Short on Story , Long on Sincerity	THE LAST LEGION , apparently based on the novel of the same name by Valerio Manfredi and cut and pasted together as a screenplay by Jez Butterworth , Tom Butterworth , Carlo Carlei and Peter Rader , may come across as a rather under-budgeted film as directed by an earnest Doug Lefler , but it does seem to have heart . The scenery is terrific and the cast consists of some of the better actors on screen who seem to have taken on this project out of respect for Lefler . It is entertaining but hardly deep . Based partly on history , the story begins with the short reign of 12-year-old Caesar Romulus Augustus ( Thomas Sangster ) just days before the Goths overthrown the city of Rome . Under the protection of Aurelius ( Colin Firth ) and Demetrius ( a buffed up and solid Rupert Friend ! ) and after the death of his parents , the young Caesar takes to the hills only to be captured and sentenced to isolation on Capri with his trusted teacher and adviser Ambrosinus ( Ben Kingsley of course ) . So far so true . From here however we begin the struggle for finding troops to re-take Rome and end up in Britannia , the home of the last legion of Roman soldiers . Along the way the escaping group is joined by a Mira ( Aishwarya Rai ) , a beautiful ' soldier ' from Constantinople and all manner of Goths and turncoat Romans ( John Hannah , Iain Glen , Peter Mullan , Owen Teale , Harry Van Gorkum , James Cosmo , et al ) , but once in Britannia their struggles are rewarded by finding the sword of Caesar that saves the day and becomes embedded in a stone and renamed Ex Caliber . And oh yes , Ambrosinus stays alive through the years to become Merlin , the one who now advises King Arthur as a child who will successfully pull the sword from the stone ! There is a sincerity of style here and a group of fine actors who seem like they are enjoying their holiday and that feeling extends to the audience . Keep expectations low and the film will provide a satisfying evening's entertainment . Grady Harp
513688	3223254	287986	7.0	Starts and Stops : A Movie Trying to Find A Story	' Dieu est grand , je suis toute petite ' is a little film by Pascale Bailly that spends a lot of time trying to tell a story in bits and pieces with numerous characters , interesting in and of themselves but confusing to the viewer , attempting to keep up with the breakneck speed of this French comedy . The saving grace is the presence of Audrey Tautou and a few other actors whose screen magnetism holds our interest . Fresh from a breakup with a boyfriend Bertand ( Mathieu Demy ) top model Michèle ( Tautou ) is a wreck of a person flirting with all manner of religious outlets ( Hindu , Buddhism , Catholicism , etc ) trying to find something to make her crazy life make sense . She encounters a veterinarian François ( Edouard Baer ) who is a secular Jew ( non-practicing , closeted , etc ) and not only does she fall immediately into bed with him ( and a next morning attempted suicide ! ) she begins to stalk him trying to embrace Judaism - a fact that at first drives François away and then a little mad himself . The manner in which Michèle and François study Judaism and all its graces and restrictions is ( I think ) the basis for the rest of the story : the filming technique of flashbacks and fragmentary moments and cutesy scribblings on pages are paced to confuse and make this simple story a maze to follow ! Along the way we meet some interesting types including Valérie ( Julie Depardieu ) who opens her door to her first psychology patient ( Thierry Neuvic ) and promptly falls in love with him ; Ali ( Atmen Kelif ) who is Michèle's nutty fashion photographer and a number of others . There are funny moments , touching moments , absurd moments , but they are loosely strung together . In the end this is a fun film in which it is a bit trying to connect all the dots ! In French , English , and Hebrew with subtitles . Grady Harp
513183	3223254	443632	7.0	An Oft-Told Tale But Good Entertainment	THE SENTINEL will not create any new ideas for movie plots for the viewer , but it is filled with some fine actors who manage to keep the pace of this rather predictable ' inside the White House ' story of intrigue moving for all of its 108 minutes . The story revolves around the protection of the President of the US ( David Rasche ) from an assassination plot , a plot that is so tight that it appears to come from within the Security System of the White House . Pete Garrison ( Michael Douglas ) is a veteran member of the White House Security but has some problems : his ex-partner David ( Kiefer Sutherland ) , convinced that Pete slept with his wife , is suspicious of Pete ; Pete is having an affair with the President's wife ( Kim Bassinger ) ; Pete is pulled into dangerous territory trying to cover his secret and use a reliable old informer ( Raynor Scheine ) to give him clues ; a new officer appears on the scene to accompany David and is a friend , Jill ( Eva Longoria ) . Once the evidence points to Pete as the planner of the assassination he is the victim of a chase , a chase that eventually uncovers the true insider perpetrator of the plot . The action is well paced and the actors make their roles as credible as possible . One of the best parts of the film is the musical score by the very talented Christophe Beck who finally gets to demonstrate his skills as an orchestrator . The fault of the film lies in the seemingly ignored fact that when well known actors are placed in a suspense movie and given very little to do except in the beginning , then the fact that they are in the cast points a big finger that they are going to be the true culprit - and that is very much the case here . But for an evening's diversion the film provides some fine action work and the storyline is tense enough to hold your interest .
513316	3223254	381717	7.0	A Lovely Avant-garde String of Pearls Searching for its Clasp	YES is film you want to love and most people who watch it probably know they are in for a Sally Potter ride , so little quirks like an iambic pentameter script shouldn't shock . There are so many gorgeous moments in this lushly painted canvas , so many isolated portions of dialog that are thought-provoking or just simply beautiful English poetry , so many scenes that are in the capable hands of Joan Allen and Simon Abkarian that are among the finest depictions of understated passion - that it is a shame the overall effect of the montages is not wholly successful . And I think the lack of cohesion must be returned to the capable but distracted hands of Potter's script and direction . Joan Allen ( who simply grows more beautiful and talented with every edgy Indie she takes on ) is a biogeneticist , a woman whose loveless marriage to cold politician Sam Neill is tolerable only because of her infatuation with her work . At a ( here is one of the choice visual pearls of perfection ) formal dinner she notices and is noticed by a handsome Lebanese cook ( Simon Abkarian ) and her heart ignites . The two talk , meet again , and respond viscerally to each other in a degree of passion and need new to both . This union opens the platform for words concerning Catholicism / Western philosophy versus Islam / Eastern loathing for the imperialism of the Western world ( read USA ) : it is the Muslim philosophy / secular West conflict that resounds so clearly in today's world . Other concepts bathed in iambic pentameter include marriage , fidelity , motherhood , racism , immigration , bickering among the kitchen staff where the cook works - all worthy topics . As the two glide along the plane of a sexual relationship the man reveals he is a surgeon / scientist who left his country because of philosophical reasons and yet defends his Muslim stance and homeland to the isolated woman who is unable to ' hear ' his crumbled life . The woman has interchanges with her goddaughter ( Stephanie Leonidas ) , her dying communist aunt ( who in voice over technique relates some of the loveliest lines in the script ) and with her husband who cannot find his center . The manner in which this all comes to an end is best left for the viewer to discover . The problems with Potter's jewel-like film are many : much of the dialog ( some of which is simply terrible writing ) is buried with excessively loud ' background ' music ( ranging from Satie to punk rock ) but worse is enunciated so softly by the actors that it is indecipherable . Yes , Shakespeare wrote his plays in iambic pentameter , but not a word is lost in performances because the actors enunciate with perfect diction and allow the poetry to flow naturally , making it become simply dialog of elegance . Potter's poetry is spotty , so perhaps it is as well that much of it is lost . When it works , it is stunning . Joan Allen is radiant in this role and gives us as defined a character as possible given the script limitations . Much the same can be said for Armenian actor Simon Abkarian . And despite the conflicts in their philosophies that threaten to crack the crystal of their affair , there is a true chemistry here . Some characters such as Shirley Henderson try very hard but simply swallow their lines in annoying and blurry accents . Sounds like a lot of negatives ? Well , they are there , but for this viewer the piece still gives the same satisfaction as hearing a new symphonic work or viewing a form of visual art in progress . There is much beauty here , enough to beg forgiveness for the shortcomings . Grady Harp
513667	3223254	372784	8.0	A Comic Book Hero Transformed into a Credible Hero	Not at all being one for the comic book fantasies that continue to flood the screens and gobble the dollars , camouflage weak scripts with tacky overblown computer graphics , introduce bizarre meanies and barely clothed wonder women , etc , I approached this BATMAN BEGINS with a big bag of prejudices . And in no time at all that bag of unjustified prejudices began to fill with applause for a truly fine film that carries style , wit , character , and enough dazzle to please everyone . This is a surprising good movie ! It takes courage to move a larger than life fantasy hero into the realm of humans who through reasons of their own feel the need to become superheroes to the down and outers of the world . Watching the early life of Batman as produced and trained and stimulated by believable characters makes the non-believer want to return to the earlier forays into the genre . So very much of the success of this film lies in the hands of a brilliant cast : Christian Bale ( once again a hunk after his pathetically shriveled body in ' The Machinist ' ) , Liam Neeson , Michael Caine , Linus Roache , Morgan Freeman , Tom Wilkinson , Gary Oldman , Cillian Murphy and yes , even Katie Holmes ( ! ) all master the tightrope of parody , serious drama , and comedy . The costumes and cinematography are exciting and the direction by Christopher Nolan is pitch perfect . It is good to have a dusty old bag of prejudices fall apart . Maybe there will be more action hero movies that take themselves seriously as an art form ! Grady Harp
513371	3223254	338097	8.0	World War II from the European View	Writer and Director John Duigan has added to his cinematic stature with this recent film about the interrelated responses of three countries - England , France , Spain - to the early phases of WW II and in doing so gives some inadvertent insight into how the continent was so endangered by the little known bad boy Hitler in the years leading up to the horror of a second World War . The title seems very appropriate - taken from the quip of ' Head in the clouds , Feet on the ground ' - as the lead character Gilda ( a radiantly beautiful Charlize Theron ) seems to float above all of the reality of warring struggles in 1933 , focusing her life on paramours , expensive clothes , and ' dangerous liaisons ' with a varied assortment of men , all the while keeping a firm stance on needs of her strangely disjointed life . Indeed , the opening of the film finds Gilda in need of shelter from a night's fling with a Cambridge lover and she knocks on the door of a poor struggling Irish student Guy ( Stuart Townsend ) , thus beginning a lasting affair that coasts through the entire story . Guy eventually follows Gilda to Paris where she is a popular photographer living with her gallerist , but also living with her lesbian lover Mia ( Penelope Cruz ) . Gilda , Guy , and Mia become a triptych and it is only the impact of the rise of fascism in Spain ( Mia's home ) that separates the ménage a trois : idealistic Guy and compassionate Mia are off to fight Franco while Gilda is left behind to admit to the encroaching threat of Nazis in France and enter into her own version of involvement . How these three weather the war and resolve their varied degrees of complicity provides the film's finale . The cast is strong , the settings are gorgeous ( in all three countries ) as captured by cinematographer Paul Sarossy , and the musical score by Terry Frewer introduces a potential talent for film composition ( while borrowing heavily from French cabaret songs , symphonic music by Edward Elgar , and pieces of Francis Poulenc ) . But the overall reason for enjoying this rather long film is the interplay of Theron , Townsend and Cruz in a variety of richly sensuous vignettes . Well worth watching . Grady Harp
513440	3223254	380817	8.0	Inside the Box	Though the cover for the DVD of WINTER PASSING ( a photo of the four main characters crowded into a box ) may make many potential viewers pass over this little film , thinking that it must be silly slapstick , this is a fine film written and directed with finesse and style by Adam Rapp , a new face whose talents have been somewhat limited to working on episodes of the TV series ' The L Word ' . Rapp gives notice of a fine writer and an equally fine director in this barely noticed little touching movie . Reese Holdin ( Zooey Deschanel ) lives in New York , an actress relegated to small parts in off Broadway theater while spending her days as a bartender hooked on alcohol , drugs and casual sex . Her life seems dead-ended : she has become anesthetized by her manner of living . An agent ( Amy Madigan ) approaches her with an offer to pay her for the letters between her parents , both once famous authors . Her mother has just died , and Reese didn't attend her funeral , so distant does she feel is her relationship to her past . But the spark of money moves her to ride a bus back to her Michigan home to salvage the letters to sell for publication . Arriving home she is greeted by the weird Corbit ( Will Ferrell ) , a Christian electric guitar player and composer who ears black eyeliner etc , but does care for Reese's severely alcoholic father - the once famous writer Don Holdin ( Ed Harris ) who hasn't written a novel in years and lives in the garage of his home under the care of Corbit and an ex-student Shelley ( Amelia Warner ) , a bright very young girl with demons of her own . Reese works at reconnecting with her father , struggles with her resentment for the ' caregivers ' , and ultimately finds the letters she came for , only to make discoveries about her dysfunctional family and her father's status that alters her view of his value as her parent . The movie is rather stagy and most of the action is unspoken , and while that technique of telling this particular story seems exactly right to this viewer , there are some who will feel frustrated at the rather static pace of the film . Zooey Deschanel once again proves that she is one of our finest actresses on the screen and hopefully this role will bring her to the attention of casting agents and result in our seeing more of this gifted actress in the future . Ed Harris is superb as the wasted , quietly grieving has-been author , keeping his performance understated and in doing so creating a character that is indelible in our minds long after the movie is over . Amelia Warner is also a fine little actress and even galumphing Will Ferrell brings more than his usual tiring comedic talents to this touching role . In all this is a movie that deserves wide attention . There is more to quietly hear and understand about interpersonal relationships than we would expect from the cover ! Grady Harp
513536	3223254	409681	8.0	" The one thing I never do is to provide alibis to cover crime "	So states the risk management owner of a service that creates ' cover lies ' for adulterous affairs . And up to a point that statement makes Ray Elliott ( Steve Coogan ) seem like an honest if distorted service provider , covering the tracks with high technology so that cheating husbands can have affairs without the danger of their wives ' discovery . Smartly written by Noah Hawley and directed with style by Matt Checkowski and Kurt Mattila , LIES & ALIBIS delivers a new twist to suspense films laced with comedy yet filled with tension , murder , and all manner of underground derring-do . Ray Elliott is a smooth talker who manages to discreetly provide protection for business men who cheat on their wives using photographers to set up situations , falsifying credit cards and names and hotel room reservations , staging gifts for suspicious wives to stave off their concerns , etc . All proceeds well until Ray's primary client Robert Hatch ( James Brolin ) hires Ray to cover his son Wendell's ( James Marsden ) Santa Barbara bed and breakfast , pre-wedding escapade with a S & M girlfriend of one Hannibal ( John Leguizamo ) - a spree that carries out a bit too far in that the girl is dead by Wendell's inadvertent orders during the ' game ' . Sam takes on the voluptuous Lola ( Rebecca Romijn ) as his new assistant and discovers she is as brainy as she is beautiful . He employs her to help his cover of the murder ( Ray had switched IDs with Wendell in a planned alibi cover for the fling ) , breaking his own rules , and Lola ends up saving the day through a manner of crosses and double crosses that fling off the screen so fast that it takes powerful concentration to keep the story progress straight - just the way coordinated crime behaves ! The manner in which this spree takes place involves a large cast including Jon Polito , Deborah Kara Unger , Selma Blair , Sam Elliott and a fine crew of bit players . Steve Coogan and Rebecca Romijn make the whole caper tick like a time bomb , giving the film elegance and just the right balance of noir and romance . The rapid-fire cinematography is by Enrique Chediak and the always dependable Alexandre Desplat provides the musical score ( with a heavy nod to Offenbach's Barcarolle from ' Tales of Hoffman ' ) . For an evening of fast-paced intrigue , romance , tension , and creative writing and acting , LIES & ALIBIS is a sure bet . Grady Harp
513650	3223254	410097	8.0	' Talk the talk or walk the walk '	Terrence Howard is one of those actors who seemingly can do anything . No matter what the role he intelligently chooses to play he is always phenomenally fine ( Crash , Ray , Lackawanna Blues , Their Eyes Were Watching God , Four Brothers , Hart's War , etc etc etc ) . In HUSTLE & FLOW writer / director Craig Brewer has finally given him a vehicle that allows him more screen time and the opportunity to create a character that burns his image on our memory indelibly . The story of a pimp and drug dealer in Memphis , stuck in the poverty level and rapidly drowning in mid-life crisis , who pulls himself into the stream of his need and dream to be something different , a rapper star , has been told before but never in the gritty realistic atmospheric way this film does . One of the most telling sequences of both writing and acting is the opening scene of the film when Djay ( Howard ) quietly talks his philosophy to Nola ( Taryn Manning ) , his primary prostitute , simply sitting in the front seat of his car , awaiting johns . Howard makes this soliloquy pungent yet quiet and in the words we hear provide the outline for the story to follow . While Terrence Howard's is towering , the supporting cast is superb also . Anthony Anderson , DJ Qualls , Taraji P . Henson , Paula Jai Parker , Isaac Hayes , and Ludicrous all offer genuine portraits of difficult characters . The smarmy side of Memphis is well captured by cinematographer Amy Vincent . This is a fine film , a bit difficult to watch at times because of the bruises of poverty and the depths to which people must descend at times to survive . But the story is pungent and tough and Terrence Howard is a marvel to watch . Grady Harp
513327	3223254	780492	8.0	Coping with Madness	CANVAS is an autobiographical story by writer / director Joseph Greco and knowing that fact helps to forgive some of the weaknesses of the film . The story - how a family copes with the presence of paranoid schizophrenia and survives - comes from the heart and is as frank a film about the subject of mental illness as any out there . And for all the inherent tendencies to play it as a soap opera , the overriding effect is one of sharing lives challenged by the presence of a crushing disease . Mary Marino ( Marcia Gay Harden ) has been afflicted with paranoid schizophrenia for nearly two years and her disease has affected her marriage to her working husband John ( Joe Pantoliano in his best role to date ) and her eleven year old son Chris ( Devon Gearhart ) : John misses work to care for Mary and still pay for her mounting hospitalization and medical bills and Chris suffers abuse form his mocking school friends , frequently having to explain away his mother's erratic behavior . Mary paints ( therapy ) the same scene repeatedly , hears voices , and finally refuses to stay on her meds , a fact that results in her long-term hospitalization in a Psychiatric Hospital . John and Chris continue to love Mary despite the radical changes in their lives and each finds a means of coping : John goes on sick leave to build a sailboat for his wife and son in his backyard ( he and Mary met and fell in love on a sailboat ) , and Chris takes up one of Mary's hobbies - sewing patches on shirts - and finds an audience and acceptance and income at his school . How the father and son survive and conquer their challenge presented by the mental illness of Mary serves to provide the ending to this story . Each of the actors is excellent , especially Pantoliano . Harden is a solid actress but the script fails to capture the essence of her response to her disease . The film feels disjointed and inconsistent and has holes of undeveloped subplots and lines of thought that keep the movie grounded . But knowing that the story is true encourages the viewer to forgive the flaws and appreciate the tough subject matter that should help every viewer to better understand the effect of mental illness on a family .

513423	3223254	316829	8.0	In Memoriam : Akira Kurasawa	' Umi wa miteita ' ( ' The Sea is Watching ' ) was Akira Kurasawa's swansong to film : his adaptation of his favored novelist Shugoro Yamamoto's story into a screenplay he intended to film was his final mark he left on a brilliant career . Director Kei Kumai pays homage to both Kurosawa and Yamamoto in presenting this visually stunning transformation of word to image . Set in 19th century Japan , the story explores the lives of the women of a Geisha house whose sole purpose in life is to earn money by pleasuring men . The house is run by an older couple who are genteel and the geishas are an enchanting group of women who know their trade and take pride in their careers . Each has a reason for turning to the life of geisha . Oshin ( Nagiko Tono ) supports her family who live in a neighboring village , Kikuno ( Misa Shimizu ) has customers both good and evil whom she manages to sustain with her stories of her higher caste . Oshin befriends an endangered samurai , falls in love with the gentle fellow , only to find that he must not marry out of his caste and leaves his pleasures with Oshin to marry his promised betrothed . Oshin's heart bruises easily but is always supported emotionally and physically / monetarily by Kikuno and the other geishas . A handsome samurai Ryosuke ( Masatoshi Nagase ) enters Oshin's life and develops the first trusted and devoted relationship with her . Kikuno is beset by problems , deciding whether to accept the humble love of an old man who wishes to marry her , and coping with a rich but abusive customer . All the while the sea is watching and as a typhoon destroys the geisha house and street , Oshin and Kikuno sit atop the roof waiting for the promised rescue by Ryosuke . The manner in which the story ends is one of sacrifice , love , and devotion . The sea is watching and will find protection for true love . The photography by Kazuo Okuhara is breathtakingly beautiful : night scenes with glowing lanterns and colorful geisha interiors are matched with recurring glimpses of the sea both calm and turbulent . The acting is a bit strained for Edo art , but the characters are well created and keep the story credible . The one distraction which is definitely NOT something Kurosawa would have condoned is the tacky Western music score that sounds like cheap soap opera filler except for the isolated moments when real Japanese music on authentic instruments graces the track . But in the end there is enough of Kurosawa's influence to imbue this film with his brand of dreamlike wonder that will always maintain his importance on world cinema . Grady Harp
513546	3223254	292513	8.0	An Intelligent , Thought-Provoking , Well Made Film	FIXING FRANK is somewhat of a rarity these days - a film well made form script to production that puts a hot topic on the table and challenges the viewer to think , all the while providing a very entertaining movie experience . The work began as a play by Ken Hayes who also adapted his play for the screen and while the ' opening up ' of a stage play on the cinematic format is successful , in many way the dialogue feels very theatrical and the method of production stagy . That fact may annoy some viewers : for this viewer it worked , allowing us to here the superb script delivered in its entirety without frosting it with unnecessary visuals . Credit director Michael Selditch for the creative approach to this filmed play . He keeps the story moving and integrated and draws exceptionally fine performances from his superb cast . In essence this is a three person film - two apposing therapists who are at opposite poles of dealing with the concept that being gay is an immutable inherited trait versus the possibility that with therapy the gay behavior can be changed to heterosexual behavior if the patient desires that ' change ' . Frank ( Andrew Elvis Miller ) , a writer who is in the process of exposing a therapist Dr . Aspey ( Dan Butler ) who claims he can ' cure ' gay men - at least according to Frank's lover Dr . Baldwin ( Paul Provenza ) , an activist gay therapist . Frank , coached by Baldwin , has sessions with Aspey with the idea of trapping him into revealing his ' damage ' to gay patients who have complained to Baldwin of Aspey's techniques . But what Frank discovers is a that Aspey deals with choices and changes on a strictly therapeutic angle , not basing claims for ' cures ' for a lifestyle he does not condemn . In the process of the ' therapy ' sessions , Frank grows into his own identity - a fact that alters his relationship with Baldwin and opens many closed doors of thought for all three characters - and us . The actors are all excellent : one wonders if they played these roles on the stage . The intermingling of the sessions with conversations outside of sessions is additive and while many may object to the theatrical use of placing all three actors on the screen simultaneously when a ' session ; is in progress , the format works well in allowing the script to be heard and maintain its punch . This is a thinkers ' movie , the concepts are controversial and may find some viewers anger points , but as a film it works exceptionally well . Grady Harp
512678	3223254	1138489	8.0	Things Left Behind - ' Good Stuff '	PERSONAL EFFECTS is a solid little film written by director David Hollander and the fine novelist Rick Moody . The premise is a study of how the traumatic deaths of people affect those left behind . The story is well told , allows the audience to explore the group therapy approach offered to families of violently killed people - the various means of responding to loss , the differing reactions from those who cannot let go of the hate they have for losing a loved one , and introduces an interesting concept of having one of the characters who narrates the film be a deaf mute young man ! Gloria ( Kathy Bates ) is the mother of twins - the girl was been brutalized and murdered and the boy Andrew ( Ashton Kuchter ) has left his career as a wrestler to return to the scene of the crime to mourn his sister and to demand the perpetrator be convicted and imprisoned : his career has been put on hold and he ekes out a living dressed as a chicken for a fast food chicken restaurant . During the ongoing twin's trial , Andrew meets Linda ( Michelle Pfeiffer ) whose alcoholic husband has been killed and she is left to support her teenage deaf mute son Clay ( Spencer Hudson ) . Through series of grieving meetings and periods of isolation on the part of each of the characters , each finds ways to support the other and a love affair develops between the older Linda and the younger Andrew as he agrees to accompany her to her various weddings for which she serves a planner . How these characters comes to grips with resolution of their losses is well tied together by film's end . This is not a great movie , but the performances by the leads are quite fine . This is a movie with a message , one that delves into territory with which many are not familiar , and for that reason alone it is well worth watching . Grady Harp
513078	3223254	433416	8.0	' We all come out of Gogol's Overcoat '	Jhumpa Lahiri's very popular novel THE NAMESAKE has been successfully adapted for the screen by Sooni Taraporevala and the gifted director Mira Nair has gathered a fine cast to capture the spirit of the original story of family commitment despite cultural changes and challenges . Some of the novel's impact is lost on the big screen , but the tender message remains at the end . In India a gifted young singer Ashima ( Tabu ) follows her family's rules of matchmaking and marries the quiet Ashoke ( Irfan Khan ) , and soon after the wedding festivities are over the couple depart to New York for Ashoke's career . The cultural and climate changes are a shock to both , but their marriage soon produces a boy child who , instead of being named traditionally by the grandmother in India , has to have a name assigned in the New York hospital in order to be released with a birth certificate . Out of desperation , Ashoke decides to temporarily name him Gogol ( Ashoke's favorite author ) - played as a child by Sohan Chatterjee - , and the family of three soon becomes a family of four with the arrival of their daughter Sonia ( Sahira Nair ) . While the parents maintain the customs of their Bengali heritage , the two children struggle with adapting to their preferred life in America and the conflict between parent and child is magnified by the cultural disparities . As young Gogol grows toward manhood ( now Kal Penn ) he favors Western ways and becomes involved with a non-Indian girl Maxine ( Jacinda Barrett ) and her family . Gogol tires of the critical comments about his name and decides to change his name to the more traditional Nick - further evidence of his separation from his background . But family tragedies occur and Gogol finds himself drawn to his mother and to his roots . When Gogol's father dies , the significance of his family grows even stronger and being unable to identify with Maxine and her family , he instead agrees to ' date ' a Bengali girl from his past - Moushumi ( Zuleikha Robinson ) has blossomed from the frumpy bookworm into a beautiful and experienced woman . They marry , keeping to Indian traditions , but the marriage is rocky and in the end Gogol discovers that his true happiness is in the rich family history and beauty of his native India . There are moments of rare beauty , both cinematically ( camera work is by Frederick Elmes ) and emotionally ( musical score is a lovely creation by Nitin Sawhney ) , and while the film is somewhat brittle at times due to the occasional bilingual nature of the script , the main characters are portrayed by such strong actors that the little flaws become unimportant . It is well to have so many films that deal with the immigrant experience at this particular juncture in our history , and when that theme is enhanced by the beauty of authors such as Lahiri , the messages become even more poignant .

512752	3223254	759612	8.0	A Bravura Broadbent Portrayal	The Myra Hindley / Ian Brady Moors murders of 1963 , one of the most heinous crimes in England since Jack the Ripper , has been beautifully transcribed to the screen by writer Peter Morgan and Director Tom Hooper . And though the story is basically about Longford's relationship with the incarcerated Myra Hindley , the film paints a rather complete portrait of a strange man who vacillated during his lifetime among religious beliefs and spoke out strongly for the rights of prisoners and ' unfortunates ' who fall out of line with the law all the while riling against pornography and other vices . Jim Broadbent creates a wholly credible Lord Longford in this amazing performance . Transformed physically to resemble Longford's bizarre appearance , Broadbent manages to convey the spectrum of trust , self-doubt , pity , outrage , compassion and blind religious belief in a manner few actors could match . The remainder of the cast is equally excellent : Samantha Morton finds every nook and cranny of the enigmatic murderess Myra while Andy Serkis gives a chilling depiction of Ian Brady , her accomplice who knew how to manipulate the government and people as well as the infamously wily Myra . The story is in many ways grounded by the strong forces of Lady Longford ( beautifully realized by Lindsay Duncan ) and the Lady Tree of Sarah Crowden and Harold Wilson of Robert Pugh . Hooper knows how to magnify the class differences between the gentry and the working class and his choices of locations and pacing of confrontations both in the prison and in the home and in the court are spot on . This is one of those films for television that teaches us what really fine films can still be . It is a tremendously moving piece of work and Jim Broadbent will long be remember for this classic role . Highly recommended for repeated viewing . Grady Harp
512824	3223254	437714	8.0	Outsourcing Elvis	ELVIS is the DVD version of the much lauded television miniseries ( it won both Golden Globe and Emmy awards for actors Jonathan Rhys Meyers , Camryn Manheim and Randy Quaid ) : the transfer of the extended three hour long series to a single DVD format is successful and demonstrates once again that made of television movies can often be superior to the Hollywood format . The film is not without its flaws : the script by Patrick Sheane Duncan is painfully pedestrian at times and the use of lip-syncing using a variety of Presley recordings isn't always convincing . But director James Steven Sadwith manages to overcome the obstacles and gives us a rather personalized view of the life of the King . The film covers Elvis Presley's life from his near poverty beginnings in Tupelo to his worldwide fame and fortune at his ' comeback ' in 1968 . The development of the committed guitar-playing singer from his first record through the development of his ' style ' and the ultimate glory and insecurity that paired his magic time is well told . If the story seems to be repetitive and goes on too long , then it also is giving the audience time to see the man behind the shadow of fame . Oddly enough Jonathan Rhys Meyers ( now so superb in another biographical series as Henry VIII in ' The Tudors ' ) was imported for the leading role , and while some may question the use of outsourcing here , Rhys Meyers is so convincing in every way that the reasons for casting him are clear . Camryn Manheim offers fine work as Presley's all-important mother and Robert Patrick plays his supportive father . Randy Quaid gives a bravura performance as the oddly successful Colonel Parker . Some of the other roles - Rose McGowan's misfired portrayal of Ann-Margaret and Antonia Bernath's of Priscilla - are less successful , but their contributions are balanced by the fine work of Tom Guinee as the pivotally important Sam Phillips . In all this is a quality piece of work about one of America's icons whose presence is still palpable thirty years after Presley's untimely death at age 42 . The awards given to this film are well earned and the DVD offers a fine ( if long ) evening of entertainment and nostalgia . Grady Harp
512845	3223254	468496	8.0	A Powerful New Dimension in Documentaries : The Director is also Invisible	Konstantin Bojanov is a fearless , sensitive , respectful observer of the young people of Sofia , Bulgaria whose lives are focused on drugs . Three years in the making ( 2000 - 2003 ) this unique documentary was possible only because of the dedication of Bojanov who sought to depict from the addicts ' vantage a problem that encircles the globe . Having used some drugs himself Bojanov approached six Bulgarian drug users as a friend and instead of exploiting their lives , he steps aside ( or beside ) and lets the six young people ( ages 17 - 39 ) talk to the camera about their perceptions , delusions , reasons for using drugs , the highs and lows of drug use , the types of drugs they use and how they obtain them , and most important - their personal philosophies of how they view life and humanity and their place in it . The characters ( these are not actors ) are addressed only by their first names : Diana , Kamen , Remi , Sasho , Stani and Vicki . They are filmed as they mix their heroin with citric acid ( ' lemon ' ) to put it into solution as it heats , how they use syringes , sharing with their best friends , how they survive finding veins that will accept the dirty needles , and then the effects of the drug once in their blood stream . At this point they stare into space with the glazed look of the junkie and share their fears , their concerns , their need for heroin , their thoughts of suicide and the response of those who have tried it and succeeded or failed . One aspect of the film is the discussion about prescription drugs widely used by these addicts in addition to heroin , drugs such as Parvikan ( an anti-Parkinsonian drug not available in the US ) , and drugs that are primarily belladonna , barbiturates , and opiates . Over the three years of the shoot we get to know some of the users well , as they change physically , as they survive in the shadows of deserted buildings and under bridges , and how their friendships endure : they are the Invisible ones , the representation of an illness we would rather not address . All of this is filmed without the words of an interrogator : Bojanov simply allows us to overhear the tragic lives these people endure , without preaching , judging , or sensationalizing . An added feature on the DVD is an extended 20-minute interview with the Director and it is from this interview that much of the film is explained in terms we can understand . Bojanov is an artistic humanitarian and he has created one of the more realistic and informative explorations of drug abuse ever filmed . It is a fine achievement . Grady Harp
513381	3223254	142393	8.0	A Meditation on Death and Dying : Reconstructing a Family	Bruce Wagner's screen adaptation of his novel I'M LOSING YOU has some of the more intelligent dialogue to be encountered in a film . Since Wagner also directed this little gem , brimming over with excellent actors , we can be assured that his message of death as a necessary component in the cycle of life is intact . Despite the dour content of the story this film actually leads to a credible sense of how deaths can ultimately be redemptive : it is all in how vulnerable we allow ourselves to become in coping with this life change . The story is focused on a wealthy Los Angeles family headed by television producer of sci-fi series Perry Krohn ( Frank Langella ) , married to a psychiatrist Diantha ( Salome Jens ) despite having a ' helper ' mistress Mona ( Amanda Donahue ) , ' stepfather ' of a disillusioned daughter Rachel ( Rosanna Arquette ) and a has-been actor son Bertie ( Andrew McCarthy ) who makes a living selling back insurance policies to AIDS patients : the father has been diagnosed with inoperable cancer and his attempts to set his will in order is the catalyst for the story . The son is separated from his ex-wife , a disturbed addicted woman Lidia ( Gina Gershon ) and the two fight over custody of their young child Tiffany ( Aria Noelle Curzon ) . Complicating matters is the fact that Rachel has never been told until now that her biologic father murdered her mother and committed suicide AND that her stepfather had a onetime sexual fling with her mother . Things begin to consistently fall apart : the son falls in love with one of the AIDS victims , Aubrey ( Elizabeth Perkins ) , to whom he sells insurance who has a son and lives in horror that she will soon die and her son will be abandoned . About this same time Tiffany is killed in an automobile accident , the fault of her drugged out mother , and Rachel embraces her Jewish heritage by learning how to perform the body cleansing ritual performed as a loving act on the dead - the dead being Tiffany . And at this peak of crises , Aubrey dies in a hospital , succumbing to every complication known to AIDS . How this fractured family comes together in the midst of all these losses and lifetime barriers to communication serves as the resolution of this complex but infinitely interesting story . The actors all give bravura performances , relishing the smart dialogue and the multilayered meanings to each encounter captured by the fine cinematographer Rob Sweeney . This may not be a film for everyone , but for those seeking more form a film than entertainment will find much food for thought here . Recommended . Grady Harp
512703	3223254	398982	8.0	Divorce , Addiction , and Other Obstacles in the Path to Happiness	Matt Mulhern is an actor turned writer / director in this amazingly fine first feature film . If DUANE HOPWOOD is any indication of the storehouse of creative and gently profound films housed in Mulhern's mind , we have a major artist being birthed . Duane Hopwood ( David Schwimmer ) is a loser : despite the fact that he is one of the most loving beings around , he is plagued by the realities of life - working a testy night job as a pit boss in Caesar's Palace in Atlantic City , failing to be present for a wife and two girls he loves but neglects due to his working hours and that has resulted in divorce , alcoholism , and failure to repair - he just can't make his life work . After a DUI arrest in which Duane has inadvertently jeopardized the life of one of his passenger daughters , is ex-wife Linda ( Janeane Garofalo ) is driven to prevent visitation rights to a man she recognizes is in truth a loving father who simply can't cope . Duane lives alone until his casino friend Anthony ( Judah Friedlander ) , a would be stand up comic , asks to share Duane's home . Duane's bad luck follows him even when he is trying to give despicable people a fair break at the casino and hence loses his job . He attempts to date a kind Irish bartender Gina ( Susan Lynch ) but fails that role when he confesses that he still loves his wife . The ultimate blow comes when Linda and her new boyfriend Bob ( John Krasinski ) decide to move to North Carolina , a fact that means Duane will rarely see his beloved daughters . And his life continues to pall-mall despite all the loving hands offered by the good people around him . The story has no beginning and no end . It is a slice of life about an Everyman racked by bad decisions , good at heart but unable to control his propensities , and the effects of addiction , divorce , and loneliness on a kind but bumbling soul . David Schwimmer gives a deeply moving performance , one that is so sensitively rendered that it holds mirrors to us all , making us love him as much as the people around him who stand by helplessly by as he spirals down the hole of self-destructive behavior . Janeane Garofalo likewise steps out of her usual silly chubby mouthy roles and gives us an injured but wholly understandable bruised woman : her acting is the finest she has ever given us . The entire cast ( with some surprise appearances by some fine actors ) is top notch , but in the end the kudos go to Matt Mulhern for offering us one of the best examinations of divorce and modern marriage with an eye that clearly sees both sides of trauma . This is an underrated , superb film that deserves a wide audience . Grady Harp
512765	3223254	428430	8.0	French Fluff Farce Surveys Pansexuality	The French have always been able to take issues involving sexuality , fidelity , relationships , and youth and create a healthy fun discussion : Hollywood still has problems even approaching these subjects , much less allowing itself to be lighthearted and universal . ' Crustaces et coquillages ' ( COTE D'AZUR ) is a little French film that addresses these subjects in a manner so light and fun that the viewer wonders what all the puritanical fuss is about ! It is summer on the Cote d'Azur and a fun couple Marc ( Gilbert Melki ) and Béatrix ( Valeria Bruni Tedeschi ) are vacationing in a wonderful beach house with their teenage kids Charly ( Romain Torres ) and Laura ( Sabrina Seyvecou ) where Marc lived as a youth . Laura immediately takes off to Portugal with her biker boyfriend and Charly spends his days with his friend Martin ( Edouard Collin ) , an openly gay teenager who is in love with Charly . Beatrix observes the boys ' interactions and decides her son is gay , a fact that doesn't bother her at all but that seems to cause problems for Marc . Béatrix's lover Mathieu arrives on the scene , declaring his desire for Beatrix to leave Marc : Beatrix isn't so sure - she loves Marc and her family , but also wants her summer lover . In a series of hilarious shower sequences Charly pleasures himself , and indeed the entire crew in the house does the same , and Martin's advances to Charly are rebuffed forcing Martin to seek outlet at the beach's notorious fort section . Marc decides to thwart Charly's excessive ' use ' of the shower and unplugs the hot water . Charly calls a plumber Didier ( Jean-Marc Barr ) , who just happens to be the hunky ex-lover of Marc , having had a gay affair before Marc married Beatrix . In following each other around , Charly discovers Martin and Didier and then Marc and Didier en flagrant and then walks in on Beatrix and Mathieu : everyone's secret is out ! But instead of a disaster , the cast suddenly breaks into a silly showbiz musical number blaming all the infidelities and facets of love on the ' violets ' ( the aphrodisiac of oysters ! ) . It is a cuckoo ending and would have been a better film without it , but the acting is all so rich and fine and the story is so well told , that this little diversion can be excused . This is a fun fling , with a superb cast having a good time ( especially the extraordinarily gifted Valeria Bruni Tedeschi ) . The story makes us laugh and think - all in a setting that is like a dream vacation ! Enjoy and have fun ! Grady Harp
512905	3223254	437232	8.0	A Solid Story , A Solid Cast , A Solid Production - but where is the passion ?	CATCH A FIRE is a very entertaining and instructive film about the 1980s South African problem with Apartheid - a time when the minority white population had political control over the far larger populace of blacks . It is based on a true story of one Patrick Chamusso , a fine working man not affiliated with the growing number of terrorists fighting to unite the black citizens to overthrow the Boers who is driven to alter his life to join the militant party of the African National Congress when he has personal experiences of abuse by the controlling whites . Patrick Chamusso ( a fine Derek Luke ) supports his wife Precious ( Bonnie Mbuli Henna ) and two daughters as a foreman at the oil plant . Though the plant is under investigation for terrorist acts Chamusso remains adamantely a pacificist . Yet when the conflicted Boer policeman Nic Vos ( Tim Robbins ) begins to bear down on Chamusso as suspect in a fire explosion at his plant , Chamusso's alibi conceals the fact that while away coaching the plant's boys ' soccer team he steals away to see his illegitimate son and ex-girlfriend and this bit of secrecy to protect his wife's feelings causes the explosion with Vos that confines him to jail . Chamusso joins the military branch of the ANC , trains with them , is captured , abused , imprisoned and finally released with the rise of Nelson Mandela . How all of the progress of the story takes place is the pleasure of the fine script by Shawn Slovo and the direction of Phillip Noyce ( The Quiet American , Rabbit-Proof Fence , The Bone Collector , Clear and Present Danger , Patriot Games etc ) who knows how to move these movies along . The cast is excellent , the sense of place ( the film was filmed entirely on location ) and the production aspects are all superb . The only problem with the film is the ' sell-out ' at the end when suddenly we are watching bits and pieces of filmed history and voice over content that seems to diminish the emotional impact of the film . Still , for another opportunity to understand Apartheid and the great country of South Africa , this film is very much worth watching . And Derek Luke , Bonnie Henna and Tim Robbins offer excellent acting skills . Grady Harp
513289	3223254	768183	8.0	What if the Draft were Reinstated ?	The Draft as a means for supplying the armed forces with manpower ended with the Vietnam War . DAY ZERO is a thought provoking film that raises the question of how today's youth would respond were the Draft reinstated as a result of the ever-growing Iraq War . Writer Robert Malkani and director Bryan Gunnar Cole respond to the question by creating three characters , long time friends , but each with a different response to the forced servitude in a wartime situation . As with any film dealing with controversial subject matter there are ideas presented that will disturb just about everyone no matter their stance on compulsive servitude , and it is that aspect that makes this film work so well in jolting our thinking . The time is New York , now , and the media has just announced the reinstatement of the Draft to cope with the drained national volunteer army . Three friends receive their draft notices simultaneously : successful lawyer George Rifkin ( Chris Klein ) whose marriage to a cancer survivor wife Molly ( Ginnifer Goodwin ) is part of the solid state of life he resists changing ; fantasy writer Aaron Feller ( Elijah Wood ) who is in progress on a novel he must finish while his life is otherwise rather on shaky ground , controlled by his loopy therapist ( Ally Sheedy ) ; cab driver James Dixon ( Jon Bernthal ) who has a past history of being a loner and attempting to control violent behavior . The gamut runs from refusal to even consider the draft ( Rifkin ) to being nonplussed by the disruption to his psyche ( Feller ) to gung-ho ready to fight Dixon . The three young men have thirty days to Day Zero and in those thirty days each undergoes profound changes and introspection and self-discovery that very keenly illustrates the effect that such a governmental edict can have on today's youth . This is ensemble acting that rivals that of any fine film : there are no stars here , only actors portraying emotional changes that are universal in nature . And for a first film by director Cole it succeeds on most levels . In addition to the work of the four main actors there are fine cameos by young Sofia Vassilieva and by Elisabeth Moss . The film is meant to raise questions , challenge our current complacency and our views of the concept or war and military obligation . That it is disturbing is part of the power of the work .

513675	3223254	404390	8.0	A Suspense Thriller That Keeps Us Running - for the Secrets	On the surface RUNNING SCARED is just another action flick with lots of expletives , violence , bloodshed , trauma , and car chases . But attempt to put the movie on ' slow forward ' and this hundred miles an hour paced film has a fine sense of pacing and excellent experimental photography , AND a cast that is up to it . Writer / Director knows this genre well and offers up a polished little frightening film . Joey Gazelle ( Paul Walker , finally given a role in which he proves he indeed can act and carry a film ! ) lives with his wife ( Vera Farmiga ) and son ( Alex Neuberger ) and is an apparent mob flunky who hides weapons in his basement to protect the mob . But when one certain pistol , used in severely wounding a cop , is recovered by the next door neighbor's kid Oleg ( Cameron Bright ) and is used against his abusive Russian father Anzor ( Karel Roden , a terrific character actor as well as fine eye candy ) , the chase begins : Joey must recover the gun at all costs and it is this wild crash of violent events involving mobs , bad cops ( Chaz Palminteri ) , hookers and child molesters that frames the course of the film . And to top it off there is a fine surprise ending . Paul Walker is excellent and it is good to see a film that is a worthy challenge for his talent as an actor . The entire cast of supporting actors , while they do little but be violent , is fine and the cinematography by Jim Whitaker is creative ( at times a bit too creative bordering on kitsch ! ) and musical score my Mark Isham complete the compelling atmosphere of this surprisingly exciting film .

513433	3223254	419722	8.0	Turning Points	EIGHTEEN as written and directed by Richard Bell may have a few too many stories to tell simultaneously for a 102 minute movie to completely succeed , but there is such a fine sense of commitment on the part of all the cast and crew that the viewer ends up wanting the movie to work - and so it does . Yes , aspects could have been finessed if the producers had more money to spend on the final cut , but as a small independent movie from Canada this is a tender , gently humorous , very touching tale about vulnerability and communication and commitment . It works on many levels . In a very well choreographed opening we are voyeurs at a family dinner where obviously something has gone awry and results in a father and two sons taking off in a car and having an accident in which one of the sons is killed . With an introduction like that the mood is set for the surviving 18-year old Pip son ( Paul Anthony - looking far too old for credibility as a teenager ) to desert his family and live on the streets . He meets Clark ( Clarence Sponagle ) a male prostitute who gives Pip food and shelter , Jenny ( the very fine Carly Pope ) who saves him from a bashing by her associate Derek ( Ryan McDonell ) and becomes romantically entangled with Pip , and Father Chris ( Alan Cumming ) in a finely wrought sympathetic role as a priest . It is Pip's 18th birthday and his father ( Serge Houde ) traces Pip down to give him a present from his deceased grandfather with instructions the gift should be opened on Pip's 18th birthday . Pip , though drinking too much and full of anger , pawns the tape machine but keeps the tape and begins to listen to the words of his grandfather Jason ( voice by Ian McKellen ) who recounts his own 18th birthday in WW II in France where he ( now the very sensitive actor Brendan Fletcher ) has an experience with a wounded medic named Macauley ( Mark Hildreth , also superb ) and reflects on his one night marriage with a cabaret singer Hannah ( Thea Gill of ' Queer as Folk ' fame and a fine singer and actress here ) , only for something to live for during the war : Jason offers succor to Macauley as he dies , with a beautiful scene of redemption for he two men at the end . The parallels of Pip and grandfather Jason interplay every time Pip listens to the tape and lead Pip to ultimately alter his view of life and love . Subplots include Clark's isolated existence as a hustler being altered by Jeff ( David Beazely - in a surprisingly fine film debut ) who simply wants to be loved ; by an unexpected pregnancy between Jenny and Pip ; by the trust Father Chris instills in both Pip and Clark in a good shepherd's manner : and by a flashback to the car accident where Pip could have saved his brother Daniel ( Paul Dzenkiw ) from an abusive act at the hands of his father , just before the accident , but failed to do so , opening his deep guilt and resultant misplaced anger , mirrored by his grandfather's taped experiences . Each of these subplots pulls together at the end , creating a sense of closure for each of the people involved . There are aspects of this film that make it seem like a big budget production : the musical score by Bramwell Tovey is performed by the Vancouver Symphony members , the cinematography by Kevin Van Niekerk is aptly atmospheric , and the general quality of acting by this Canadian cast is very fine . Though Paul Anthony handles his role well , casting a very young teenager in the pivotal main role would have made the story work much better , and Richard Bell , with only one other film ' Two Brothers ' on his resume , gives promise of a young talent to watch . Despite the shortcomings , EIGHTEEN is a worthwhile film and deserves attention . Grady Harp
512935	3223254	459666	8.0	Three Times : A Century of Reponses to Love	THREE TIMES ( Zui hao de shi guang ) is so frank a film that the viewer may get lost looking for the hidden meanings in this century traversal of lovers ' interactions in China . Not one for simple linear film-making , director Hsiao-hsien Hou instead opts for mood and suggestion and leaves the paucity of dialog to make room for emotional involvement and response . Three periods - 1966 A Time for Love , 1911 A Time for Freedom , and 2005 A Time for Youth - are depicted with the same main characters , Qi Shu and Chen Chang , who prove to be exceptionally sensitive to the concept from the director : with each new tale these fine actors mold new characters and questions and yet allow us to see a line of similarity in the couples as the director has suggested . The film wisely opens with the most successful of the three ' Times ' - 1966 A Time for Love - - tracing the emergence of timid passion between a lad headed for the military and a young girl who works in a pool hall . They communicate by letters after their first brief introductory encounter and circumstances interfere with the progress of their relationship in 1966 Taiwan . The middle section 1911 A Time for Freedom is gorgeous visually and conceptually the director has elected to use the cinematic form of the period ( silent movie ) to tell his story about the freeing of a young girl from the grip of a brothel madam and surveys the political tensions between Japan and China as the quietly lighted story of love and yearning unfolds . The film ends with 2005 A Time for Youth and here our lovers are caught up in the pollution of smog , cellphones , emails , nightclubs , and infidelities for same sex affairs that speak loudly about the tenor of the times . Hsiao-hsien Hou's films are an acquired taste and many will find the choppy editing , the fragmentary scenes that are not always well focused for the story line , and the over-long length ( 130 minutes ) too much to endure . But the ideas are fresh and the characters and vignettes are memorable , and most of the major critics in the media have lavished praise on this film . It is an interesting work but for this viewer there are enough flaws to keep it grounded . Grady Harp
512763	3223254	166793	8.0	Multiple Views of Why Francois Ozon is a Fine Director	X2000 ( ' Scenes de lit ' ) is a pastiche of the short films made by Francois Ozon before and during the year 1998 . The excellent collection offers tangible proof that Ozon's gifts were well established in short stories before he tackled the important films he has produced to date : ' Swimming Pool ' , ' Under the Sand ' , ' 8 Women ' , ' 5X2 ' , ' Water Drops on Burning Rocks ' , etc . The man has vision , courage in tackling taboo subjects , and a style that remains his own . ' Truth or Dare ' is a brief 4 minutes of play among four youngsters ( two boys , two girls ) who test the limits of fantasy and sexual exploration and the fun little game ends with a most touching ' dare ' . ' Little Death ' is the longest of the works ( and the most engaging ) and introduces Paul ( Francois Delaive ) , a gay photographer whose images are those of men's faces during climax , and his lover Martial ( Martial Jacques ) whose lives are disrupted by Paul's sister Camille ( Camille Japy ) demanding that Paul visit his estranged , dying father ( Michel Beaujard ) . Paul does so but takes his camera and photographs the nude , near comatose father in a sort of revenge that results in his ultimate resolution of his years of distance . The next set of very brief clips is entitled ' Bedtime Stories ' and is a wonderful glimpse into moments of truth between couples dealing with nascent sexuality , fetishes , May / September encounters , hygiene dilemmas equally spaced among straight , gay and lesbian themes . And the final brief film ' X2000 ' is merely a millennium dawn with a nude man awakening to the detritus of a New Year's party which includes an aging corpulent bedmate , some voyeurism watching a couple at sexual play and another couple ( twin men ) sleeping in a zipped bag . It is simple but resounds with messages about the expectations versus findings of a new millennium . The 64-minute film stands well on its own , but for those who have become fans of Francois Ozon's brilliant full-length films , this little plate of hors d'oeuvres is irresistible . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
513638	3223254	395972	8.0	A Retrospective Look at a Landmark Ruling	NORTH COUNTRY is a tough movie to watch - and that is why it is so fine and important . The story exudes out of the characters surrounding the first class action suit for sexual harassment in the workplace and it would be difficult to imagine a more dour and gritty depiction of what women iron miners faced in Northern Minnesota than that director Niki Caro ( Whale Rider ) has molded out of Clara Bingham's book and Michael Seitzman's screenplay . Though overly long ( in excess of two hours ) the film does successfully drive home its points and its issues . Josey ( Charlize Theron ) is an abused wife who after yet another beating form her husband takes her two children back to her hometown in Northern Minnesota where her mother ( Sissy Spacek ) and disturbing defiant father ( Richard Jenkins ) still view her as an embarrassment to the family : Josey became pregnant at age 16 and states she ' doesn't know the child's father ' . Josey's only concern is to make a living for her children and not be reliant on her parents . She works as a hair washer in a beauty salon until her old friend Glory ( Frances McDormand ) recognizes her and urges her to apply for work in the iron mines were wages are good despite a disturbing atmosphere . Reluctantly Josey agrees to apply , much to her father's disdain , and she moves her children away from her parents to live with Glory and her adoring husband Kyle ( Sean Bean ) . Once at work Josey encounters the disgusting macho miners who constantly sexually harass the female minors . The situation deteriorates until finally Josey cannot tolerate it and she hires the sweet ex hockey athlete turned lawyer Bill ( Woody Harrelson ) to take on her case . What proceeds in the trial for the class action suit and a tough trial it is . The fact that the bravery and courage of Josey and her colleagues results in a ' win ' is almost a given as the film is based on historical fact . Charlize Theron once again delivers a fine performance and in part due to the brilliant support of the supporting cast gives us a character to remember . Frances McDormand , Sissy Spacek and Richard Jenkins deliver superb portrayals and the large supporting cast is first rate . For much of the film the viewer gets the feeling that we've been here before ( many other films about the mines and the traumas here played are familiar ) , but the narrative is powerful and in the end sweeps all others aside as a statement that needed desperately to be made . Recommended . Grady Harp
512676	3223254	455824	8.0	After a Slow Start , Australia is Excellent	Baz Luhrmann needed to re-think his overly long epic of life in Australia during WW II : The first hour of this 165 minute film comes across as caricature with Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman being introduced as rather overblown , preposterous characters about whom the audience could care less . But then suddenly the mood changes , the film becomes tender and real and issues of importance are treated well and presto ! - an entirely different film is on the screen . It would be interesting to see this film edited by a major editor who could comb away the extraneous silliness of the beginning and make this film far more dramatic and solid . Though the film begins in 1939 and continues into 1941 , it feels like an old American Western flick with cattle drives , and rancher disputes and the development of a classy Lady Sarah Ashley ( Nicole Kidman ) from England traveling to her husband's ranch in Australia to face the failing of her inheritance , becoming involved with the politics of her competitor , finding support from her household of Aborigines who manage her ranch with the able assistance of a rowdy Drover ( Hugh Jackman ) . One important key element in the film is the emphasis on half-breed children ( half Aborigine , half Caucasian ) who are called creamies and who are shunned by both sides of their inherited genes . One lad Nullah ( Brandon Walter ) feels he has no one who cares for him outside of a kindly spirit grandfather King George ( David Gulpilil ) who gives him support from the shadows of the hills of the Aboriginal land . The interesting part of the film is the manner in which this young boy pulls the other characters together , even during the Japanese invasion in 1941 . At this point the film becomes an epic worth watching and one accompanied by warmth and tenderness as evil is destroyed and the milk of human kindness rises . Once out of their caricature beginnings , Kidman and Jackman ( and Walter ) give fine performances . They are aided by some fine effects from cinematographer Mandy Walker and by a musical score by David Hirschfelder that mixes excerpts from ' Somewhere over the rainbow ' with Bach's Hunt Cantata BWV 208 ( ' Sheep may safely graze ' ) and of course the wondrously emotional Nimrod from Elgar's ' Enigma Variations ' . There are elements of information about racism and greed that are treated well . And by the time this lengthy film is over the audience is left satisfied . So 10 stars for the second part of this movie and 2 - 3 stars for the first hour gives if a 8 star overall rating . Grady Harp
512727	3223254	421073	8.0	And if you like James Ellroy . . .	Despite the fact that we are seeing a plethora of ' bad cop ' movies , it is hard not to like STREET KINGS by the premiere writer of this genre , James Ellroy . This film is not unique in subject matter , but the pace of the action , the keen directing by David Ayer , and the cast of important and popular actors makes this film well worth watching . Tom Ludlow ( Keanu Reeves ) is a damaged person after his wife's ' unsavory death ' and he is the take-no-prisoners type of cop who goes after the tough gangsters and offs them rather than arresting them . His boss is Captain Wander ( Forest Whitaker ) whose unit is filled with corrupt cops ( Jay Mohr , John Corbett , Amaury Nolasco , Chris Evans etc ) . There is brutal activity surrounding a personal feud between Ludlow and Washington ( Terry Crews ) and during a convenience store holdup , Washington is killed in Ludlow's presence . Internal Affairs Captain Biggs ( Hugh Laurie ) is out to pin the incident on Ludlow , but what happens as the death of Washington is investigated throws light on the depth of corruption within the police force . The manner in which each of the corrupt cops is taken out serves as the rapid - fire conclusion of the film . This is a dark film and were it not of Ellroy's storytelling gifts it could seem banal . But Reeves and Whitaker give excellent performances and draw the audience into this putrid vat of cop corruption despite the urge not to watch the deeds . A good action , heavily noir film .

513704	3223254	454084	8.0	' Disabilities ' and Possibilities	The title and cover of this DVD suggest a film that is more fluff than substance . But don't be fooled by these clues . BLIND DATING is a well-written ( Christopher Theo ) , well-directed ( James Keach - brother of Stacy Keach and husband of Jane Seymour ) story about the coping of the visually impaired , the quirks of Italian and Indian families , brotherhood , and the gamut of finding the right partner in a world of essential blind dating ! One of the reasons the movie works so well is the ability of actor Chris Pine to make us believe he is blind and convey the positive manner in which people with impairments ' view ' those around them . Danny ( Chris Pine ) was born prematurely and as a result is blind , and as he grows toward age 21 he feels he is unattractive to women . His family is warm , loving and Italian and supportive - especially his brother Larry ( Eddie Kaye Thomas ) who runs a Limo service and is constantly trying to find Danny his first physical encounter , be that with hookers , girls from the office or neighborhood , or just referrals - each of whom is a disaster when it comes to dealing with a date who is blind ! Danny discovers an operation that implants a camera-like contraption in his brain that will allow him the possibility to see again , even if the images are simply black and white and indistinct . In the office of ophthalmologist Dr . Perkins ( Stephen Tobolowsky ) is a young girl Leeza ( Anjali Ray ) who is Indian and whose parents have arranged a wedding with a man she does not love . And yes , in time Danny and Leeza are attracted to each other in what appears to be a doomed relationship - for family reasons . Danny has his operation and is able to see some images , but the implant fails and Danny once again is without sight - but far from being without hope , as both his and Leeza's families undergo changes of heart . There is a sense of love that emanates from the screen , due in part to the script , the direction , and to the acting . Chris Pine is exceptionally fine in a challenging role , finding the balance between courage , comedy , and tenderness that make his character believable and lovable , and never once making a move that breaks his image as a sightless person . The entire cast is fine , including a hilarious Jane Seymour as Dr . Evans , Chris ' therapist with a penchant for disrobing in front of her sightless patient ! But the aspect of the film that sets it apart from many is the presentation of everyday type prejudices that can be every bit as hampering as a physical impairments ! This is a warmhearted , very human comedy with many messages . Grady Harp
512834	3223254	426931	8.0	Music and the Harmony of the Universe : A Film for Dreamers	AUGUST RUSH will not go down in history as a profound film : many will even go so far as to dismiss it as kitsch , maudlin , and a simpleton take off on ' Oliver Twist ' , and other pejoratives . For this viewer the little film is tender and frequently requires suspension of belief , but in the end the idea of the story does indeed bring a tear to the eye . Based on a story by Paul Castro and Nick Castle and transformed for the screen by Castle and James V . Hart , the premise is that of a fairytale , but an unusual fairytale built around the impact of music . On one magic night in New York City classical cellist Lyla Novacek ( Keri Russell ) and popular Irish guitarist / singer Louis Connelly ( Jonathan Rhys Meyers ) meet on a rooftop , languishing in their own disappointments with life and finding solace in each other's arms , and that night Lyla becomes pregnant , never to see Louis again , and struggling to keep her baby despite her father's demands to abort . Lyla delivers her baby boy , but the child is immediately taken away ( Lyla is told the child was stillborn ) . ' Evan Taylor ' AKA August Rush ( Freddie Highmore ) is placed in an orphanage , longing for parents he believes he can ' hear ' in the music of the spheres . Compelled to find his parents he escapes the orphanage after eleven years and is taken in by Faginesque Maxwell ' Wizard ' Wallace ( Robin Williams ) who teaches his street urchins the fine art of pick pocketing and playing music on the streets as buskers . Renamed August Rush , Evan has uncommon musical talents and rapidly becomes a big money maker for Wizard while at the same time being discovered as a potential pupil for Juilliard by Reverend James ( Mykelti Williamson ) and his girl singer Hope ( Jamia Simone Nash ) with assistance from kindly social worker Richard Jefferies ( Terrence Howard ) . August Rush composes a rhapsody that is to be played in Central Park , a chance to place his music before the world and attract his parents , both of whom have returned to music careers after eleven years absence and learn of the existence of August Rush , their ' unknown son ' . And yes , the ending is a happily ever after one . . . Kirsten Sheridan directs with a sure hand and a keen eye toward make believe . The cast is strong , especially Jonathan Rhys Meyers , and the musical score , a very mixed bag , provides a suitable background for the story . This is one of those movies that asks us to go along with a lot of improbable events , but the pleasure of the experience is worth the journey . Grady Harp
512909	3223254	825236	8.0	The Microcosm of the Beauty Salon	SUKKAR BANAT ( CARAMEL ) marks a fine directorial debut for the stunningly beautiful Lebanese actress Nadine Labaki . Though films about the private lives of a circle of women who gather in a mutual watering hole to gossip , share joys and pains of love affairs , as well as being the important support group they all need are plentiful ( think STEEL MAGNOLIAS ) , few come as close to the intimacy shared by this talented cast whose disparate problems keep the film flying . The screenplay by Rodney El Haddad and Jihad Hojeily is greatly enhanced by the cinematography by Yves Sehnaoui with the atmospheric musical score by Khaled Mouzannar , but it is the impeccable cast that completes this tender , humorous , and gently sentimental little tale . The film shows us a Lebanon we rarely see . The setting is a Beirut beauty salon La Belle owned by Layale ( Nadine Labaki ) whose frequent absences from her place of business are due to trysts with a married man , trysts often delayed by a police officer , the handsome and infatuated Youssef ( Adel Karram ) . Working in the shop is Rima ( Johanna Moukarzel ) whose same sex infatuation with a beautiful patron is subtly explored , and regulars in the salon include an aging wannabe actress Jamale ( Gisèle Aouad ) , a non virgin bride to be Nisrine ( Yasmine Elmasri ) and an older seamstress Rose ( Sihame Haddad ) who has elected to relinquish her hopes for love with a willing and potential elderly man Charles ( Dimitri Staneofski ) in favor of continuing to care for her humorously senile mother Lili ( Aziza Semaan ) . How these unforgettable characters interact , displacing each other's anxieties by caring friendship freely shared , offers each of these fine actresses many moments of glory in addition to creating a fine ensemble effect as sensitively directed by Nadine Labaki . This little film ( in Arabic and French with subtitles ) is a complete pleasure and will likely draw attention to future films from Lebanon . Grady Harp
513299	3223254	1117385	8.0	' Prison desensitizes you . '	Writer / Director Ric Roman Waugh may not have a large number of completed films under his stuntman belt , but if FELON is any indication of the quality of work we can expect from him , it seems he has a solid future . There are many films about prison life and prison breaks that keep coming down the pike , but few of them have the quality of being character studies of how prison affects the minds and lives of both those incarcerated and those on the outside who must deal with the realities both concurrent and future of living in the shadow of ultimate effects of prison experiences . FELON is a strong character-based prison drama . Wade Porter ( Stephen Dorff ) is a young man on the rise : he is planning to marry the mother Laura ( Marisol Nichols ) of his child Michael ( Vincent Miller ) , his small business is finally becoming successful , and his family life is happy . One evening Wade's and Laura's sleep is interrupted by an intruder who steals Wade's wallet , then runs out of the house with Wade chasing him with a baseball bat . One hit with the bat the robber is dead . The police arrive and because of the logistics of the timing of the blow to the robber , Wade is arrested for murder . Unsuccessful attempts to explain the situation eventually lead to Wade's being sentenced to prison and he is sent to a prison run by a sadistic Lt . Jackson ( Harold Perrineau ) with demons of his own . A famous prisoner John Smith ( Val Kilmer ) is transferred to the prison and becomes cellmates with Wade . The racial violence between prisoners creates rules and gangs and Wade is caught up in the violence that occurs in the daily ' hour in the yard ' experiences , until John shares his knowledge of prison logistics and advises Wade in how to avoid critical issues . The prisoners are not only violent among themselves , but they are also the pawns of the brutally evil Lt . Jackson and his crew who appear to delight in the traumas the prisoners create . It is obvious that the good guy / bad guy line is blurred and in order to survive Wade follows John's wise council to an ending that eventually results in some correction of the evils of the prison situation . Survival is the key in the cases of many of the characters , including some of the ' good guards ' ( Nate Parker , Greg Serano ) , the steadfast Laura , her mother ( a small but well defined role for Annie Archer ) , and for former guard Gordon ( Sam Shepard ) a friend of John Smith . Dorff and Kilmer provide very strong characterizations as does Perrineau , but without the fairly large cast of ' fellow prisoners ' who set the scenes , their overall performances would be less impressive . It is here that Ric Roman Waugh demonstrates his talent for handling the mixture of physical brutality with the fragility of each individual's mind that makes the film work . It is a tough film to watch but it is solid craftsmanship . Grady Harp
512659	3223254	346491	8.0	A Director's Cut Reformation of Alexander	Few films have garnered the criticism as the theatrical release of the much maligned Alexander and that fact always stirs the curiosity cauldron - in this case , so much so that Oliver Stone decided to re-edit and re-compose the original version into this Director's Cut DVD . Now the film can be viewed in the relatively inexpensive milieu of the home and perhaps more folks will give another ( or , as in my case , a first ) look at what the grumbling is all about . Alexander is a big film about a big person who did big things . How a story so altered by time , history , myth , and folklore could be translated to the screen strains the imagination - but not Oliver Stone's - a man who loves big events and big issues . And I think he succeeds in drawing us into the atmosphere of the ' civilized world ' of Alexander's time . Ptolemy ( Anthony Hopkins ) relates the history of a man who wished to tie the known world together into one empire and would have us believe that dream was altruistic as well as destined . Through a series of flash forwards and flashbacks the birth to death of Alexander is pieced together : each time a great moment or crisis occurs in Alexander's life , the story backtracks to explain the etiological influences of that particular step in Alexander's march around the globe . The settings of Alexander's youth in Macedonia are breathtakingly beautiful in the cave painting details of the various gods and heroes and heroines that so deeply influenced the life of Alexander - Medea , Oedipus , Herakles , Zeus , etc . If the entire film had been able to maintain this mystic quality of ambiance , this would have been a powerful work . But once the scenes begin to disperse to Persia , India , Greece , etc the film becomes Hollywoodized and hearkens back to the Cecil B . DeMille view of ancient history , garnished with expensive sets and costumes and endless dancing maidens and overwrought battle sequences . Where this film ( at least this version ) is best is when it approaches the passion of Alexander for Hephaistion . Few writers or film makers have dared to enter the arena of homosexual love of heroes of history and this is where Stone takes the chance - and then unfortunately heavily edits the romance from this ' director's cut ' . A missed opportunity to examine an important aspect of neglected history is sad . As for the cast , Colin Farrell does his best with the script he has in making us believe in Alexander , and he is able to connect the chemistry with Jared Leto's Hephaistion well . Angelina Jolie is aptly smarmy as the snake-loving Olympias , Val Kilmer's Philip , grotesquely hidden behind scars of makeup , is suitably evil , but given the tritely written roles of Aristotle ( Christopher Plummer ) and Roxane ( Rosario Dawson ) the rest of the cast is forgettable . But now that the film is available in two forms for less money than a pair of theater tickets perhaps more people will watch , plug in to Oliver Stone's concept , and the air will clear . I , for one , think it is a film worth watching ! Grady Harp
512724	3223254	970468	8.0	' Brother , can you spare a dime ? '	The lead-in cinematic and musical elements for this delightfully entertaining , fast paced , little bit of nostalgia film prepares the viewer for the story as well as any ' overture ' could . The setting is London in the 1930s , the day of the first blitzkrieg , and the tone of the imagery is that quiet depression and angst that tainted the world during that time . We meet our main character Miss Guinevere Pettigrew , a dowdy , middle-aged failed governess as she wanders through the streets and soup kitchens - all to the tune of ' Brother , can you spare a dime ' . This ' day in a life ' abruptly changes when Miss Pettigrew , still saddened by the loss of her beloved in WW I and struggling to be moral as the daughter of a clergyman in a world gone to tatters . How she finds one day of joy - and in the process changes the lives of those she encounters - is the line of the story , a screenplay by David Magee and Simon Beaufoy based on the novel of the same name by Winifred Watson and directed with a fine sense of timing and comedy cum pathos by Bharat Nalluri . Quite by a fluke Miss Pettigrew ( Frances McDormand ) absconds the name of a potential client from her caustic job finder and rings the bell of one Delysia Lafosse ( Amy Adams ) , a beautiful young American manipulator of men living in one boyfriend's luxurious flat while entertaining others who may help her reach her dream of being a star on the musical stage . Delysia believes Miss Pettigrew to be a social secretary and immediately involves her in the game of her life of flirtation and illusion . Miss Pettigrew , at first shocked by the ' social setting ' , soon adapts and indeed supports Delysia's efforts of meandering through gentleman callers , and as Delysia finds Miss Pettigrew indispensable she dresses her well and introduces her to a life Miss Pettigrew finds quite foreign but equally fascinating . In rapid fire sequence , at times overlapping like a Keystone Cops movie , we meet Delysia's paramours ( played with devilish glee by Tom Payne , Mark Strong , and Lee Pace ) as well as high society dames ( Shirley Henderson ) and the one man who seems above it all - Ciarán Hinds . All of this wild dash through the superficial society affairs is played against the all but ignore threat of the impending WW II and it all happens in one day . But at the end of that day the bond between Miss Pettigrew and Delysia is genuinely sealed and for a moment at least it seems Miss Pettigrew's previously dour existence has changed . A fine cast , an intelligent director and a cinematographer John de Borman and musical director Paul Englishby make this bit of froth into a confection that contains some social commentary ingredients . The costumes and sets are splendid and provide a view of London before the devastation of the war that is rich in nostalgia . Not a great movie , but a delightful romp that allows McDormand and Adams the opportunity to demonstrate their considerable comedy gifts . Grady Harp
513264	3223254	822849	8.0	Finding Redemption in Tragedy	RAILS & TIES , under the guidance of first time director Alison Eastwood , tackles an implausible subject of multiple tragedies resulting in repairing personal breaks and with the able assistance of a groups of excellent actors makes a finely tune , sensitive study of little lives struggling against major odds . It is well conceived , well written ( Micky Levy ) , well acted and sincerely moving . Tom Stark ( Kevin Bacon ) is a train engineer , married to his job as well as being married to his nurse wife Megan ( Marcia Gay Harden ) who is facing the ugly fact that her breast cancer is terminal . The cancer has spread beyond Megan's body into the tenuous space that keeps a marriage glued : Megan attempts to hide her desperate need for emotional support by continuing to work as a nurse and Tom takes on extra train runs to avoid the reality that face him at home . The other side of the story is equally sad : young Davey Danner ( Miles Heizer ) cares of his psychologically shattered mother ( Bonnie Root ) and unknowingly accompanies her on a jaunt to ' see the train ' - a ploy well planned by the suicidal mother to drive in front of an oncoming train to end her life along with Davey's . The conductor of the train is of course Tom Stark , and when Tom first sees the car on the tracks , he keeps to company policy that recommends gradual slowing rather than the danger of an abrupt stop : the result is the death of Davey's mother but Davey escapes the crash while trying to pull his mother from the car . The tragedies mount : Davey is left homeless , being placed in a foster home run by the cruel ' mom ' ( Margo Martindale ) only to escape to find the ' killer ' of his mother ; Tom is put on leave for the incident ; Megan gets the final word that she has very little time left and is ready to leave the distant Tom . It is this inadvertent entrance of Davey into the lives of Tom and Megan that results in a healing of three souls who are desperate for the connection of love . While some my find the story implausible and saccharine , others will appreciate the manner in which Eastwood holds rein on the story , playing it for quiet honesty instead of explosive situations . Both Bacon and Harden deliver the quality of sophisticated performances that have marked their careers , and the remainder of the cast gives strong support - especially Eugene Byrd , Marin Hinkle , Bonnie Root , Margo Martindale , and of course Miles Heizer . This is a tough story to tell but the film holds an indelible mark on the viewer . Grady Harp
512929	3223254	433350	9.0	An Intelligent and Stylish Film That Goes Beyond Its Genre	BOY CULTURE is a very fine little film and were it being evaluated solely within the confines of gay films , it would easily rate 10 stars . It is well written , well directed , well acted and has messages that cover a fairly broad territory ( racism , homophobia , hustler life style , relationships , coming out tales and tales from the closet , etc ) . There are some technical flaws with the film and some unresolved character problems that prevent it from being what it comes close to being , but finally here is a gay themed film that is wise , entertaining , and user-friendly for a larger population than the community for which it was made . The story is biographical in nature : " X " ( Derek Magyar ) is a male hustler who lives off the income from a limited clientèle of regulars , who occupies a living space with two gay roommates - Andrew ( Darryl Stephens ) and Joey ( Jonathon Trent ) - and who has what he thinks it takes to make him happy . The missing element is love , and in several ways he comes into proximity with that missing thread : his newest client is Gregory ( Patrick Bauchau in a richly nuanced performance as a elderly closeted loner ) who introduces X to the finer things in life , including introspection and looking for what is missing in his world . Andrew is a conflicted African American man who still misses the caring he had with a girlfriend whose wedding he is to attend . Joey has just turned 18 and looks to X and Andrew as father figures . The problem is that X and Andrew have deeper feelings of attraction and commitment to each other than either wants to admit , and the story ( as narrated by X ) is about how this mutual challenging need is resolved . Q . Allan Brocka directed and co-wrote the film with Philip Pierce and the dialog is snappy at times and gently tender at others . The cast is quite fine : the young lads are top notch eye candy while bringing solid acting skills to their roles , and the older actors bring a since of resilience to the story that keeps it grounded in style . This is a very good little film that deserves a wider audience , one that needs to see this aspect of the population once considered merely peripheral . Movies like this help understanding interpersonal relationships , and everyone needs to address that . Grady Harp
512825	3223254	427470	9.0	Heist Story with a Human Twist	THE LOOKOUT , written and directed by Scott Frank ( who also wrote ' The Interpreter ' , ' Minority Report ' , ' Get Shorty ' , ' Dead Again ' , etc . ) is a clever story of a bank robbery but that is really a secondary plot to this excellent drama that deals with characters with impairments and how they cope with the world at large . The cast is superb and the film ranks with the fine ' sleepers ' of the year . It is a movie that is not to be overlooked . Chris Pratt ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt , rapidly becoming one of the top screen presences ) is one year post automobile accident that has left him with altered memory function . Once a banner boy in athletics and scholastics , he is now reduced to living his life with the aid of a pocket notebook that ' reminds ' him to ' wake up , shower with soap , get dressed etc ' . He lives with a blind roommate Lewis ( Jeff Daniels in another fine performance ) who works with Chris , helping him adjust to his handicap by teaching him to work backwards in his thinking as an aid to progressive memory capture . Chris carries a card with him that informs people he is brain damaged and for the most part people are kind and help him go about his daily routine : he works as a janitor in a bank with the hopes of becoming a teller one day . Chris encounters an old acquaintance Gary ( Matthew Goode ) in a bar and after a conversation Gary sees Chris as a perfect foil for a planned robbery of the bank where Chris works at night . The mounting frustrations of Chris ' handicap bring him to the point where he will do anything for change and he hesitantly agrees to be the lookout for the back robbery . When the night of the robbery arrives and things go awry , Chris reverses his decision to participate and the traumas that occur bring Chris ' memory back and a surprise resolution to the story is very successful on many levels . The script is beautifully crafted and impeccably delivered by Gordon-Levitt , Daniels , Goode and the supporting cast . The DVD featurettes are almost as exciting in the information they offer , especially from Gordon-Levitt , as the film itself . This is an example of a low budget film that is smart , classy , addresses human issues in a straightforward manner , and has more depth than the majority of films that have come out this year . It is a film that is highly recommended viewing on many levels . Grady Harp
513042	3223254	466665	9.0	A Small Independent Film with a Big Message	THE ARCHITECT is a film based on a play by David Grieg that deals with social class dichotomy , lack of communication in families , gender confrontations in youths , and coming to grips with decisions of the past that later haunt . Made on a budget less than a million dollars and shot in twenty days , this unique little movie packs a wallop in the most secretive and subtle way . Directed by Matt Tauber , who also wrote the screenplay with Grieg , it has a fascinating , if at times disconcerting , format of quick scenes flashed before our eyes like simultaneous conversations - and some of the power of the film is piecing those snapshots together as the film ends . Leo Waters ( Anthony LaPaglia ) is a successful architect , married to a wife Julia ( Isabella Rossellini ) who seems on the edge of mental instability . They have two teenage children - Christine ( a very fine young actress Hayden Panettiere ) who at age 15 is aware of her body and yet fearful of its implications in her interactions with boys and men , and Martin ( Sebastian Stan ) who has returned home from school as a drop out whose mind is preoccupied with soul searching . The discord at home is matched by the incipient calamity ongoing at a Project Leo designed early in his career , a Project now physically crumbling under the weight of drug dealing , crime , and discontent tenants - all led by activist Tonya Neeley ( the superb actress Viola Davis ) who has one daughter at home with an early conceived baby and another daughter who has stepped out of the Projects to better her education ( her twin brother committed suicide in despair of his plight in the Projects ) . Two families in conflict over different reasons on the surface but sharing a similarity that is demonstrated as the story proceeds . Christina naively begins to frequent bars and is protected by a truck driver Joe ( the very fine actor Walton Goggins ) who kindly introduces her to the realities facing hormonally charged yet fearful young girls . Martin , in an attempt to understand the Projects problem as explained to his father and family by Tonya , visits the Projects and meets Shawn ( the very fine and handsome young actor Paul James ) who cautiously helps Martin discover his sexuality only to succeed in allowing Martin to discover his true sexual proclivity but meets a sad ending when he is rebuffed . At the peak of tensions Tonya succeeds in winning over Leo's understanding of her activist dilemma , Julia breaks and leaves her family and both of Leo's children discover life lessons that will imprint their psyches permanently . Minor victories rise out of major turmoil - and the writer and director have the courage to leave the story for us to resolve . It is refreshing to encounter a cast of actors so sensitive as this one . From the leading roles to the most minor of characters the acting is absolutely first rate . We need more films of this caliber to remind us that one of the purposes of art is to allow us to see the problems of our world . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
513661	3223254	342258	9.0	Transcending Evil , Discovering Humanity	Luc Besson's signature style is all over the writing of this very fine little film . His ability to push the buttons on the most violent screen business while gradually developing a tale of warm sentiment is well served by director Louis Leterrier and a perfect cast of actors . UNLEASHED is one of the few examples of how martial arts and bona fide drama can be mutually supportive in creating a film that is at once thrillingly athletic and gently tender . Bart ( Bob Hoskins ) is a brutish loan shark thug who makes his ' collections ' accompanied by his ' dog ' Danny ( Jet Li ) , a silent man Bart has raised form childhood to be a caged killer , a human with a dog collar that when removed unleashes a ferocious beast who kills on command of his master Bart . Bart keeps him in a cage , feeds him , and uses him solely for his criminal doings . Danny unleashed is simply a Pavlovian animal and when the collar is replaced , he becomes docile with the sad eyes of a puppy . During a ' collection ' gone bad , Danny escapes and finds shelter in an antique shop basement where he meets blind piano tuner Sam ( Morgan Freeman ) , a gentle man who gradually introduces Danny to music , trains him as his assistant , and introduces him to his ' family ' - his step daughter Victoria ( Kerry Condon ) . With the two of these welcoming , tender people Danny discovers how beautiful life can be . The story from this point is how Danny chooses between his Pavlovian response life as a killer and the simple life of Sam and Victoria . The journey is not without stressors and it is a difficult transition that keeps the viewer on seat's edge . The wonder of this film lies in the extraordinary performances not usually associated with martial arts films . Jet Li does some of his finest athletic fighting on film , but thankfully at the same time creates a character who is multidimensional and memorable - a very fine acting job by Li . Bob Hoskins is brilliant as the despicably cruel Bart , Morgan Freeman adds a luster to his fine portrayal of blind Sam , and Kerry Condon makes Victoria zany and lovable at the same time . The action is superbly captured by cinematographer Pierre Morel with the aura of darkness in Danny's caged life serving as a perfect foil to the martial arts sequences . In short , this is a fine little film about characters worth knowing and provides audiences with both action and drama of a very high level of achievement . Grady Harp
513653	3223254	118230	9.0	Love : Four Divertimenti	Gaël Morel co-wrote ( with Catherine Corsini ) and directed this very French exploration of the manifestations of love in a style that feels more like eavesdropping on private encounters than on a linear drama . The plot is actually tightly woven around each of the four characters , at the same time giving the effect of four characters ' viewpoints on love . Samir ( Mezziane Bardadi ) is a French Arab from Algeria who opens the film in a tender frolic with his ' blood brother ' and quickly witnesses the accidental death of the man he loves . He travels to a small town in France , lonely , needy , feeling like an outsider ( remember the history of the French Algerian conflict ) and encounters a young novelist Quentin ( Pascal Cervo ) celebrating the publication of his first novel with his best friend Jimmy ( Stéphane Rideau ) and his girlfriend Julie ( Élodie Bouchez ) in a dance bar . Samir and Quentin make eye contact and soon a brief assignation outside the club leads to a kiss that the vulnerable Samir views as a sign of love but that Quentin views as strange but as possible content for his next novel . Quentin loves Julie , Julie loves Quentin , but has an eye on Quentin's best friend Jimmy , a lad faithful to his friendship with Quentin to the point of fending off Julie's enamourment . But when Quentin and Samir begin spending extended periods of time together ( Samir longing for a physical relationship , Quentin refusing but intent on gathering information for his novel ) , affinities are tested . Quentin departs for Paris to write , Jimmy and Julie begin a lusty affair , and Samir feels again deserted by a lover . Samir is attacked by gay bashers and defended by Quentin who in the course of the fight sustains a head injury , an injury at first easily resolved but one that later leads to tragedy . Quentin returns from Paris to discover Julie has found love with Jimmy and while Samir's obsession with Quentin races at the new availability of Quentin as a partner , Quentin is disgusted and returns to his career as a writer in Paris and the story comes to a protracted ending with a series of sad incidents : Quentin , the core of each of the love stories remains aloof , dedicated to his growing fame as a writer and gleaning the events as fodder for his assent to literary fame . The stories are bound with threads if same - gender love , homophobia , human frailty and need . The actors are all beautiful for the eye and render tender performances . The countryside of France is exquisitely captured by cinematographer Jeanne Lapoirie and director Gaël Morel manages to weave these little stories in a conversational , simple manner that appeal to the heart and the eye . For some the film may seem rambling and disconnected and unfairly compared to ' The Wild Reeds ' , but Morel has a sensitive , gentle manner in setting a mood that allows it to flow like a stroll through the flowering woods of young passions . Recommended . Grady Harp
513023	3223254	443446	9.0	The Damages of Suppression	' La Bestia nel cuore ' ( ' The Beast in the Heart ' released in the USA as ' Don't Tell ' ) is an intense Italian film written and directed by Cristina Comencini that tackles subject matter so visceral that the telling of it requires complete concentration from the audience in order to feel the power of the impact at the end . It is a tough film to watch because of the story , but it is a superb film to watch because of the excellent cast and production crew . Sabina ( Giovanna Mezzogiorno ) is introduced to us in a cemetery where she is arranging for the interment of her dead parents : the mood for the story is subtly set . Sabina is a dubbing actress for translating films into Italian , a ' sell-out ' acting job compared to the life of her live-in boyfriend Franco ( Alessio Boni ) who is a stage actor being tempted to accept a role in a TV series which pays more money than the stage . Sabina confesses she wants to get pregnant , she does , and with her pregnancy she begins to have nightmares of shadowy childhood memories . She is afraid to discuss these with Franco , or with her best friend Emilia ( Stefania Rocca ) who is blind and has been in love with Sabina since childhood . It seems the only person with whom she can confide her secret fears is her brother Daniele ( Luigi Lo Cascio ) who has moved from Italy to Charlottesville , VA where he is a professor at the University and has a happy family life with wife Anna ( Lucy Akhurst ) and two children . Sabina flies to the US to be with her brother and in the course of their reunion the two siblings uncover the beasts in their hearts : sexual abuse from their father now departed . How this discovery alters their lives is the dénouement of the film . There are many subplots - infidelity on the part of Franco while Sabina is away , a lesbian relationship that develops between Emilia and another of Sabina's friends Maria ( Angela Finocchiaro ) - and Comencini draws subtle parallels between these twists along side the main story of incest discovery . Yet without concentration , these subplots can become distracting . The acting is on the highest level and the changing locations are shot by cinematographer Fabio Cianchetti with sensitive respect of the nuances of suggestion encased in each place . The uncredited musical score is an admixture from Robert Schumann's piano sonata to contemporary works and serves to heighten the actions and mood . In Italian with subtitles . A film well worth watching .
513066	3223254	162661	10.0	Tim Burton's Visually Stunning Masterpiece	As far as adaptations of old American novels go , Tim Burton's visually rich , tightly composed , resplendent version of Washington Irving's ' The Legend of Sleepy Hollow ' ranks in the top echelon . The script for the screen is the work of Kevin Yagher and Andrew Kevin Walker and while it takes some liberties from Irving's story , the resulting dialogue and action pacing are so wholly in keeping with Burton's vision that it feels like an original story . Much of the magnificence of this film is due to the atmospheric set design by Rick Heinrichs ( with art direction by Ken Court , John Dexter , and Andy Nicholson with set decoration by Peter Young ) and Colleen Atwood's extraordinary costumes . It is not usual to credit these artists when reviewing a film , but their contributions are an integral part of the success of the movie . As far as acting , Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane shines in a fully nuanced character portrayal complete with paraphernalia and ticks and mild madness . He is ably supported by Christina Ricci ( in one of her finest moments ) , and a troupe of brilliant actors that includes Michael Gambon , Miranda Richardson , Casper Van Dien , Jeffrey Jones , Richard Griffiths , Christopher Lee , and Ian McDiarmid . They appear as though they are daguerreotypes , so perfectly in keeping with the time and period and mannerisms of Irving's novel . The musical score by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki are synchronous with Tim Burton's brilliant direction . This is a treasure of a film . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
513459	3223254	462477	10.0	A Brilliant Little Film Opens the Window to an Unknown Profession	PIERREPOINT : THE LAST HANGMAN is one of those films that emerges from the cracks in the theater ' failures ' only to find its poignant message when released on DVD . Granted , the idea of a story based on England's most famous executioner doesn't immediately catch the interest of the general audience , but for those fortunate enough to either rent or buy this DVD , the rewards are plentiful . It is a little masterpiece of writing , acting , directing and production values . Albert Pierrepoint was the third man in his family to ' ascend ' to the list of executioners ( capital punishment in England at the time was by hanging ) , and when he is accepted to the list in 1932 he begins what became the longest and most prolific career of British executioners . He took enormous pride in his work , assuring his peers as well as his ' victims ' that every aspect of his job was done with obsessive professionalism : his timing of his duties was the shortest on record , meaning that from the moment he opened the door to the condemned prisoner's room through the hooding and noose placement and tripping of the platform and subsequent death of the ' criminal ' , he spared suffering as much as was feasible . He was supported by a wife who kept the secret of her husband's anonymous role and it was only when the Pierrepoint's pride in his job became known that downfall of their lives is threatened . At times adored by the public for his assignment to hand the Nazi criminals and the famous murderers and eventually the target of the anti capital punishment activists , Pierrepoint's professionalism sustained him until a final tragic assignment changed his view of his job . Timothy Spall is splendid as Pierrepoint , capturing all of the nuances of the simple , honest man's pride as well as his Achilles ' heel . Juliet Stevenson turns in yet another understated and completely realized role as Pierrepoint's wife . Director Adrian Shergold , using a script written by Bob Mills and Jeff Pope , paces the film sensitively , drawing on the atrocious duties involved in the job of executioner ( they actually had to prepare the bodies of the dead victims for the morticians ! ) along with the moments of pub frivolity to allow the audience to understand the true person Timothy Spall absorbs in his portrayal of Pierrepoint . The sets and lighting and cinematography could not be better . This is a film to view and absorb and appreciate the superior quality of acting of Spall and Stevenson . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
512649	3223254	382691	10.0	The Title , Sadly , Says It All	' La Femme de Gilles ' ( ' Gilles ' Wife ' ) began as a novel by Madeleine Bourdouxhe and was transformed for the screen by Philippe Blasband , Marion Hänsel and Frédéric Fonteyne who also directs this stunning and controversial art piece . Certainly one of the most visually magnificent films of recent years ( cinematographer Virginie Saint-Martin ) ' Gilles ' Wife ' succeeds on every level : the story is unique , the direction is liquid and languorous , and the cast is superlative . Elisa ( the remarkably sensitive Emmanuelle Devos ) lives with her husband Gilles in what appears to be a perfect marriage : Elisa is the doting but sincerely in love housewife who spends her days caring for their twin daughters , cleaning house , cooking special meals , canning berry jams , keeping her husband satisfied sexually ; Gilles ( Clovis Cornillac ) appears to be a loving husband , tender with Elisa , enamored with her , and content . Elisa has a younger attractive sister Victorine ( Laura Smet ) who visits this haven-like household frequently to see her nieces and almost from the start we sense there is an attraction between Gilles and Victorine . Elisa becomes pregnant with their third child and Gilles grows a bit distant . Elisa gradually acknowledges the fact that he is having an affair with Victorine and though hurt by the deception she decides the only way to keep Gilles is to allow him to discuss the matter with her . Patiently she listens to his fears that Victorine may have another lover and in fact allows Elisa to stalk Victorine to substantiate the affair . Elisa accomplishes her mission and Gilles is devastated with the truth , all the while paying little attention to the emotional sacrifices Elisa is making on his behalf . There are confrontations , Elisa even seeks out a priest to help her in resolving her pain but the priest doesn't pay attention and Elisa is left with silence . When eventually the affair between Gilles and Victorine ends Elisa has given birth to a son , accepts Gilles ' remorse , and ultimately in her own quiet way finds a mode of redemption for her trials with an unfaithful husband . The fact the Elisa is content to be just ' Gilles ' wife ' instead of maintaining her dignity is hard to swallow at first but in Emmanuelle Devos ' gifts as an actress we are made to understand her choices . The triad of actors here are amazingly fine and they are directed with graceful sensitivity by Frédéric Fonteyne . As an extra on the DVD there is an extended conversation with Fonteyne who shares some of the deleted scenes - this viewer only wishes there were not deleted ! - and gives one of the more intelligent surveys of a film's story and progress on record . The visual painting of the scenes is so very beautiful that each frame could be a canvas . This is an impressively fine and deeply moving film . Highest recommendation . Grady Harp
513401	3223254	388395	10.0	A Heartwarming Journey Into Retired Living !	SCHULTZE GETS THE BLUES is one of the more poetic films about aging and the choices people make at points of life-change as any to date . The utter simplicity of technique that writer / director Michael Schorr uses to tell this quiet tale of the glory of the human spirit is magical . This is one of those films that deserves a very wide audience from every age group ! Schultze ( Horst Krause ) , Jürgen ( Harald Warmbrunn ) and Manfred ( Karl Fred Müller ) have just been retired from their life's occupation of working the salt mines in a bleak little German town , and are left to ' celebrate ' ( with their company ' trophy lamps ' made of large illuminated salt crystals ! ) , drink beer , and ponder their next step : retired life . Of the three , Schultze is the loner , his wife in an extended care facility for the mentally challenged where Schultze plays his accordion polkas for their entertainment . The woman in charge Frau Lorant ( Rosemarie Deibel ) encourages Schultze to further his interest in his accordion . Manfred and Jürgen insist he play polka music and enter a contest in America . But Schultze has heard zydeco music on the radio ( zydeco = a style of dance music originating in Louisiana that is usually played on accordion , guitar , and violin and combines traditional French melodies with Caribbean and blues influences ) and becomes quietly obsessed with that music . Off to America to compete in a Texan Polka Contest , loner Schultze wanders to Louisiana where he finds not only the music of his soul but a people who accept him more than his little German hometown . And the gentle message of this quiet little film is about loneliness and friendship and the impact they make on us all . Schorr spends the bulk of this two-hour journey with visuals that depict isolation , longing , and the small things that make up what we call life . His cast is superb , with Horst Krause's Schultze creating one of the most memorable characters on film . In a time when Baby Boomers are looking at retirement with anxiety , this little movie is just the antidote . Highly Recommended ! Grady Harp , October 05
513247	3223254	370986	10.0	The Impact of a Childhood Incident on Two Lads : The Spectrum of Extremes	MYSTERIOUS SKIN is a brilliant film made with tremendous courage and skill by the justly venerated Gregg Araki . His screen adaptation of Scott Heim's fine book is tough , insightful , balanced , challenging , and wholly successful . Few other directors , except possibly Gus van Sant and the Stephen M . Ryder / Michael Cuesta team ( ' L . I . E ' ) , would be brave enough to make a motion picture that presents a story that includes pedophilia and there find a moving study of developing sexuality in youngsters that becomes an important and sophisticated drama . 1981 , Hutchinson , Kansas . Neil McCormick ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) is 8 years old and finds fascination watching his rather loose mother Ellen ( Elizabeth Shue ) have sex with multiple partners . Neil is attracted to and desires the males Ellen brings to the house . He is a hang loose guy and the star member of a Little League baseball team coached by ruggedly handsome Bill Sage . Also on the team is a another 8-year-old , Brian Lackey ( Brady Corbet , ) who is from a neighboring town and is the easily distracted , bespectacled , non-athletic son of Mr and Mrs Lackey ( Chris Mulkey and Lisa Long ) , whose sole reason for being on the team is at the demand of his macho father . Some time lapses and Brian becomes convinced he has been abducted by aliens , the only way he can explain a loss of 5 hours of time and the presence of subsequent nosebleeds and fainting spells . In Hutchinson , Neil's attraction to his Coach results in a close friendship that just happens to evolve into sexual play , something Neil treasures as he has fallen in love with his Coach . Neil's best friends are Wendy ( Michelle Trachtenberg ) in whom he confides everything , and gay Eric ( Jeffrey Licon ) who happens to be in love with Neil . 1991 and the two boys have matured - Neil has become a full-time hustler , receiving pay for sex from older men cruising the park . Wendy moves to New York after gently warning Neil to always play safe in his ' occupation ' . Meanwhile Brian has grown up into a lad obsessed with outer space aliens and discovers a friend Avalyn ( Mary Lynn Rajskub ) through a TV show about people who claim to have been abducted by aliens . They bond much to Brian's now-single mother's concern , and Avalyn pledges to help Brian find the people who haunt his dreams about the missing five hours of his life at age 8 . Neil moves to New York and becomes a full time hustler , falling in with all manner of johns and becomes disturbed when he is confronted by an AIDS patient john followed by a sadomasochistic john . Wendy encourages him to leave hustling and find a ' real ' job . Neil's mother lovingly sends Neil tickets to return home for Christmas and Neil departs New York for a meaningful trip home . While Neil has been away Brian has discovered with Avalyn's help that Neil is the strange person in his nightmares , becomes friends with Eric - his connection to Neil - and Brian awaits Neil's return to Hutchinson to confront Neil and find his missing 5 hours of years past . Aided by Eric , Neil and Brian bond and Neil agrees to reenact a significant moment when they were eight years old , a transformative time that includes the coach and the effect of the Coach on the two boys ' lives . It is a powerful moment has monumental consequences . Araki directs this story with such grace and finesse that he makes each of the main characters not only credible but also multidimensional and lovable . There are no good guy / bad guy polarities in Araki's vision , only a spectrum that feels as real as the air we breathe . Every member of this large cast is superb , without exception , but the work of Joseph Gordon-Levitt anchors this film with wholly natural and brilliant acting . The others ( Brady Corbet , Michelle Trachtenberg , Elizabeth Shue , Bill Sage especially ) rise to the same level . Kudos also go to the young actors Chase Ellison and George Webster who portray Neil and Brian at the age of 8 . And the musical score underscores the action well . This may not be a movie for everyone , though I wish it were as seeing this film provides deep understanding into some of the sexual spectrum too many people refuse to address . It is a wholly successful film on every level . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
513718	3223254	870111	10.0	The Rise and Fall of Showmen	FROST / NIXON is one of the most successful screen adaptations of a play yet made . Perhaps that is due in part to the fact that the popular stage play by Peter Morgan was revised for the screen by the playwright , but it is also to the credit of director Ron Howard who managed to suffuse the ' play as movie ' with such atmosphere and feeling of spontaneity that the rather long movie seems to whisk by more rapidly than history ! Everyone knows of the infamous David Frost interview with Richard Nixon after Nixon had resigned office and was living in semi-seclusion in San Clemente , California , a bitter man struggling with the demons not only form the recent past but also form his childhood . Frost took on the challenge to bring the perpetrator of the Watergate scandal to his knees to satisfy the American public's need for retribution , and in conducting these interviews he did indeed achieve that . The story is as much a character study of Frost as it is of Nixon and the parallels writer Morgan uncovers makes the film far more than a quasi-documentary . This is real drama played for all it's worth . Frank Langella is unforgettable in his portrayal of Nixon as is Michael Sheen as Frost , each actor having played the roles on Broadway and transferring that depth of understanding to the screen . The surprise in this film is the use of the peripheral cast of characters - Kevin Bacon , Oliver Platt , Sam Rockwell , Matthew Macfadyen , and Toby Jones - a group of actors who light the darker corners of the story with aplomb . FROST / NIXON should be required viewing for every Political Science major in our schools - and hopefully will urge the nation to find a similar manner to bring closure to the strangely coincidental machinations of the recent Bush administration crimes .

513722	3223254	918927	10.0	A Message of Profound Importance Delivered by a Brilliant Ensemble	DOUBT succeeds on every level - from the fine transference of Patrick Shanley's play to the screen ( Shanley wrote the play , the screenplay , and directs ) to the atmospheric cinematography excursion through the Bronx of the mid 1960s to the detailed delineation of the characters by Meryl Streep , Viola Davis , Amy Adams , Phillip Seymour Hoffman , and even young Joseph Foster , to the careful editing . It would be difficult to imagine a finer cast , here cast in roles counter to their usual types , bringing such power to the poetry of Shanley's lines . The story is well known by now ( the dismissal of a progressive priest by a crotchety old Catholic school principal over a false rumor and all the ' doubt ' that brings into play in every character ) , but multiple viewings of this film intensify the humanity of each of the characters and demonstrate just how fine a writer Shanley is . The subject matter is difficult at first but the manner in which each of these superb actors ( under the guidance of Shanley's direction ) explore the effects of spite and loathing and forgiveness shares some of the finest ensemble acting in years . Recommended . Grady Harp
513071	3223254	890885	10.0	Appreciating and Celebrating the Extended Family	Ferzan Ozpetek understands as well as any writer / director today the concept and attending importance of Extended Family . Much as he spoke about the importance of friends who are often more supportive than genetic family in his beautiful film HIS SECRET LIFE , he explores a similar topic in his latest exceptional film SATURNO CONTRO ( SATURN IN OPPOSITION ) . Ozpetek and his co-writer Gianni Romoli have created a story about camaraderie , celebration , shared loss , consolation , and healing among a rather disparate group of Romans that manages to not only underscore our human needs , but also demonstrates how nearly insurmountable hurdles can be managed by the kindness and understanding of true friends . Davide ( Pierfrancesco Favino ) is a much admired writer who lives with his artist partner Lorenzo ( Luca Argentero ) in a healthy , loving relationship . Davide has many admirers who wish to fall under his influence as a writer and Lorenzo likewise has many friends who are devoted to him . These friends gather at the home of Davide and Lorenzo for meals , parties and celebrations - a place where each of the friends finds compassion for whatever is nibbling away at their happiness . Davide's close friend Antonio ( Stefano Accorsi ) is married to the beautiful Angelica ( Margherita Buy ) who is writing a book about smoking and is not aware that her husband is having an affair with florist Laura ( Isabella Ferrari ) until a mutual friend , translator Neval ( Serra Yilmaz ) - caring for both friends ' concerns - shares the information . The possible disastrous discovery is overshadowed by the sudden subarachnoid hemorrhage suffered by Lorenzo during a communal meal . Each of the friends ' lives are halted while they gather at the hospital awaiting the inevitable death of their friend - each with open arms of support for Davide and each other as they find their way through dealing with the circle of life . The story places Lorenzo's tragedy near the beginning of the film : the resolution and coping of the large number of this extended family form the message and the sidebars that explore the sanctity of friendship and caring . There are myriad moments of rare beauty in this little film , moments that include the tenderness of Lorenzo's father's acceptance of Davide's relationship to his son as the funeral is passing , the wordless mending that the death of a friend brings to the dissolving marriage of Angelica and Antonio , and many others . This is a beautifully photographed film ( Gian Filippo Corticelli ) and one with a musical score ( Giovanni Pellino ' Neffa ' ) that is so subtle that it supports without distraction ( much like the presence of Extended Families ! ) . The acting is of the highest quality from some of Italy's finest actors . We can only hope that Ferzan Oztepek continues to create meaningful films such as this for a world that too often settles for finding solace as well as happiness from artificial sources outside the circle of human relationships . In Italian with subtitles . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
512900	3223254	366721	10.0	A Grecian Threnody	THE WEEPING MEADOW ( ' Trilogia I : To Livadi pou dakryzei ' ) is writer / director Theodoros Angelopoulos ( with influences from Tonino Guerra plus assistance from Petros Markaris and Giorgio Silvagni ) creating a personal vision of the 20th century . The incredibly gifted Greek poet of a filmmaker mirrored the life and death of his own mother whose time on earth spanned a century and elected to capture the 100 years of sadness in a trilogy of films : The Weeping Meadow is Part I and details the years 1919 through 1949 . It is a masterwork . The film opens with what will be the trademark look of the movie - vistas of lonely people in a nearly monochromatic color space that uses water , both from rain and the collected results of rain . A group of refugees from Odessa have landed by a river in Thessaloniki where they must attempt to reconstruct their lives . Among them is a family - a wife and husband with their young son and a three-year-old orphan Eleni they have protected . The entire movie seems to be in slow motion , but that is just the studied , unhurried rhythm of Angelopoulos ' direction . As time passes we find that Eleni at a very early age has just given birth to twin boys while she has been sent away for the family's appearances : the father is the young son of the family . The story progresses through the World Wars , the civil wars , the influence of Hitler and Mussolini , the natural disasters of floods and disease , the social disparities of class , the rise of unions , the fall of democracy - all mirrored in the family that is trying to make the chaos of living in Greece resemble some sort of order . The young man is a musician and once he and Eleni have reunited with their twin boys , he decides he will go to America , the land of Promise for poverty stricken refugees , to work and make enough money to bring Eleni and the twins to America . But in his absence the progressive civil unrest and poverty the three endure in his absence results in the ultimate dissolution of the family . The story is less important than the moods evoked . The cinematography by Andreas Sinanos is a long gallery of miraculously composed , beautiful images : the cortège on the river , the flapping white sheets behind which we discover musicians , the constant vistas of the ocean and the river , the village and the battlegrounds burn themselves onto our visual fields and into memory . The gorgeous music that accompanies this symphonic work is by Eleni Karaindrou , mixing folksongs with wondrous symphonic moments . The cast is superb : they manage to create very specific people despite the fact that we rarely see them up close . But in the end this visual treasure is the extraordinary work of Theodoros Angelopoulos . If this is Part I of a Trilogy ( at almost three hours running time ) , we can only imagine the power that will follow in the Parts II and III . Experiencing THE WEEPING MEADOW takes patience and a long uninterrupted period of time ; the rewards are immeasurably fine . In Greek with English subtitles . Grady Harp
512956	3223254	418004	10.0	Making the Ordinary and the ' Unordinary ' Extraordinary	NEVERWAS , a little miracle of a movie written and directed by Joshua Michael Stern , is an allegory , a fairytale , a dissection of the impact of mental illness on parents and children , and story of compassion , believing , and blossoming of character that was created with a sterling ensemble of actors in 2005 , failed to find a niche in theatrical distribution , and went straight to DVD - becoming one of those limited release films that is very elusive even in the megavideo stores . The reasons for this relative anonymity are not clear , but film lovers will do well searching out this little gem : the rewards are immediate gratification and long lasting satisfaction . Narrated by Ian McKellan who plays a major role in the film , the story concerns the return of psychiatrist Zachary Riley / Small ( Aaron Eckhart ) to an obsolete mental institution named Millhouse , the hospital where his author father T . L . Pierson ( Nick Nolte ) ended his days in suicide , having suffered from bipolar syndrome . Zach wants to discover secrets about his father , why his father's book ' Neverwas ' has been so disturbing to Zach , and to offer good medical treatment to those patients living in the obscure hospital run by the kindly but enigmatic Dr . Reed ( William Hurt ) . Zach is buoyant , greets his new job with joy , and works with various patients in group and individual therapy ( the group includes well developed characters portrayed by Alan Cumming , Vera Farmiga , and Michael Moriarty , among others ) and encounters the apparently mute Gabriel Finch ( Ian McKellan ) , a delusional man who believes Zach has returned to break the curse preventing his return to his imaginary kingdom of Neverwas . Zach meets a ' grad student botantist ' / reporter Ally ( Brittany Murphy ) who loves Zach's father's book and urges Zach to read the fairytale as a means to assuage Zach's new nightly nightmares and insomnia dealing with images of himself as a child , his father's suicide , and other strange forces . Ally's commitment to Zach's father's book , Zach's breakthrough to Gabriel Finch , together with Zach's re-evaluation of his agoraphobic mother ( Jessica Lange ) all intertwine to reestablish Zach's discovery of his relationship to a father whose mental illness prevented the close relationship Zach so desperately missed . In a tumbling set of events that incorporate the fairytale of the book Neverwas with the reality of Zach's father's relationship to Gabriel Finch brings the story to a heartwarming , well considered , touching conclusion . Being ' unordinary ' is a goal , not a curse . In addition to the above-mentioned stellar cast , small parts are also created by Bill Bellamy , Ken Roberts , Cynthia Stevenson among others . The cinematography by Michael Grady manages to keep the audience balanced between real and fantasy and the musical score by renowned composer Philip Glass fits the story like a glove . Ian McKellan gives a multifaceted performance of a man whose delusional life is far more real than his life as a mental patient , Aaron Eckhart finesses the transformation of the lost child seeking his roots with great skill , Nick Nolte gives one of his finer interpretations as the disturbed father / author , and Brittany Murphy manages to maintain a much needed lightness to the atmosphere of the mental institution story setting . The impact of the film , while absorbing from the first images , is the ending , a reinforcement of the importance of love and nurturing that too often is relegated to little books for children instead of the manner in which we live our lives . This is a fine film well worth ferreting out from the obscurity to which it so unjustly has been assigned . Grady Harp
512857	3223254	463998	10.0	An Important Film from a Committed Company	FREEDOM WRITERS produces more catches in the throat than many a film in years . This viewer avoided the film , thinking it was yet another in a long line of ' bad school kids with criminal instincts ' brought around by a champion teacher ( starting with ' Blackboard Jungle ' the same story has been told almost yearly ! ) : it is a distinct pleasure to share that this film is so very different on many levels that it makes all the other school problem / redemption movies pale in comparison . Based on a true story about a Long Beach California High School just after integration and busing altered the state's educational system , the book " The Freedom Writers Diary : How a Teacher and 150 Teens Used Writing to Change Themselves and the World Around Them " by Erin Gruwell is a compilation of the journals of the student of a newly mixed racial classroom ( African American , Latino , Cambodian , Chinese , White ) voicing their experiences about coming together as a family due to the influence of a novice , naive , but highly motivated and insightful teacher - Erin Gruwell . The book was adapted for the screen by director Richard LaGravenese and carefully cast with young actors who represented the very groups about whom the story is written . Erin Gruwell ( Hilary Swank , in her very finest role to date ! ) is married to a frustrated architect student Scott ( Patrick Dempsey ) who has ' settled ' for a life as a computer programmer . Erin , the daughter of a Civil Rights activist ( Scott Glenn ) , is idealistic and wants to teach in a place where she is challenged , a chance to make her life meaningful . She graciously and naively steps into a classroom of high school freshmen , all form different gangs and scarred by racial violence , frustrated to be trapped in a classroom with a white woman who seems clueless to their real life problems , wanting to teach them literature ! The story unveils the technique Erin develops to erase border lines and bond the students by visits to the Holocaust Museum , taking them to nice restaurants in Newport Beach , treating them with respect and asking them to see the similarities in each other . The students respond , despite the harsh warnings of Erin's fellow teachers Margaret ( Imelda Staunton , in another exceptional role ) who insists everything is by the old rules , and Brian ( John Benjamin Hickey ) who has little use for the new system and group of students . As an example of how the students transform their characters is the funding of a visit to Long Beach by the woman who hid Anne Frank ( the students have read her diary as a vulnerable Jewish child ) and Pat Carroll plays that woman Miep Gies in yet another outstanding performance . Though the film is strong in every moment and every member of the cast ( though the brilliance of Hilary Swank's portrayal is one of incredible realism and subtlety ) and the various actors who comprise the Freedom Writers are superb : April Lee Hernandez , Mario , Jason Finn , Deance Wyatt , Kristin Herrera , Jacklyn Ngan , Sergio Montalvo , Vanetta Smith , Gabriel Chavarria , Hunter Parrish , Antonio García , Giovonnie Samuels , and Jacklyn Ngan and yes , they all deserve mentioning in a review . This is a full company effort and the result is a deeply moving film that celebrates the individual and the right to hope and to achieve . A Must See Experience . Grady Harp
513076	3223254	490234	10.0	Longing and Loving and the Precipice of War	Claude Miller has created one of the more challenging and intensely human dramas about World War II in his film UN SECRET ( A SECRET ) . Though one of many stories about the plight of Jews during the events that lead up to and exploded into WW II , Miller's story is less about the cruel destiny of the Jews in Hitler's plundering of Europe than it is a study of a few individuals who struggled with their identity in the face of probable extermination . Based on a true story in Phillippe Grimbert's novel by the same name , UN SECRET gracefully and artistically draws the viewer into the psyche of the narrator François Grimbert ( played at ages 7 , 14 and 37 by Valentin Vigourt , Quentin Dubuis , and Matthew Almaric ) whose relationship to his father Maxime ( Patrick Bruel ) has always been strained . The story winds from contemporary time , to the period in France before WW II , through the horrors of the Halocaust , and the years of rebuilding following the war . Maxime ' Grinberg ' ( Patrick Bruel ) marries Hannah ( Ludvine Sagnier ) in a beautiful Jewish wedding . Hannah's brother is married to a brilliant athlete Tania ( Cecile De France ) and even at the wedding the equally athletic Maxime has eyes for Tania . All possible conflicts seem to diminish when Maxime and Hannah have a son , Simon ( Orlando Nicoletti ) who develops into a naturally gifted athlete ? the joy of Maxime's life . As WW II approaches the Jews of Paris are instructed to wear their yellow Star of David patches , and while Hannah feels pride in her race , Maxime refuses to be ' labeled ' and defies the ruling . When the SS come to transport Jews out of Paris , Hannah and Simon are removed to a camp while Maxime manages to stay in Paris with a new French name . Popular as a fashion model and designer , Tania is able to stay unnoticed as a Jew also , but her husband is off to war and extermination . Maxime and Tania learn of their families ' demise and bond , eventually marrying using French names ( Grimberg becomes Grimbert ) , join the Catholic Church and have a son ? François ? who is nothing like Simon nor does he know of his father's rejection of him as a poor comparison to the perfect Simon But as the years pass François discovers his family's past and a reconciliation with his Jewish heritage confronts him . How the maturing François ultimately relates to his distant father brings closure to the story . The cast is excellent , including some of the lesser roles - especially the ever-present Louise ( Julie Depardieu ) - played by gifted actors . Claude Miller's recreation of time lapses is successfully highlighted by interchanging black and white with color photography ( by cinematographer Gérard de Battista ) and the changing moods of the story are greatly enhanced by the musical score by Zibigniew Preisner . UN SECRET , then , is a stunning work that explains many aspects of the varying responses of Jews to that horrid period of history designed by Hitler . It is a deeply satisfying and profoundly moving film . Highly recommended .
513465	3223254	478829	10.0	Giving Back the Gift : The World of the Prodigy	VITUS is a film from Switzerland that has garnered many accolades and nearly won an Oscar . And yes , it is that good ! Written by Fredi M . Murer , Peter Luisi , and Lukas B . Suter and directed by Murer , VITUS explores the life of a child genius , a lad who from the age of five is obviously gifted in that he can play Bach et al after only a few months lessons and is able to read books and understand concepts that make his stance in a regular kindergarten class untenable . But the film is less about the gifts of a child prodigy than it is a story of how a genius child longs for a normal childhood . It is in the telling of the story that the audience is privileged to discover the joys and trials in a child's view of being extraordinary . Vitus - played at age 6 by Fabrizio Borsani and at age 12 by Teo Gheorghiu - is referred to as a little Mozart by his parents Helen ( Julika Jenkins ) and Leo ( Urs Jucker ) , and by the family friends who are amazed at Vitus ' gift as a pianist . But as is often the case with gifted children , they are overprotected , not allowed to engage in the normal activities of being a kid . Vitus finds consolation in his grandfather ( a brilliant Bruno Ganz ) whose creative energy includes Vitus in his longing to fly and to build complex machines . While Vitus continues his love for the piano he also takes risks with his beloved grandfather . Vitus ' intelligence serves him well in analyzing the complexities of his father's job and his grandfather's role in that position , and it is his genius that leads the family in a direction no one thought possible . And of course with every story of an extraordinary young lad adapting to a puzzling world , there is also a love interest : Isabel at age 12 ( Kristina Lykowa ) is his fun-loving babysitter and at age 19 ( Tamara Scarpellini ) is the queen of his inexperienced heart and fill a void in Vitus ' life that otherwise would be empty . Fitting all of these subplots together is made magical by Vitus ' constant playing of classical music - a feat the young actor is capable of performing on his own ! The cast of this film is not only gifted but is also endearing . Bruno Ganz is a brilliant actor and he is matched by both of the young actors who play Vitus . The story is tender but avoids bathos . It simply is an uplifting , inspiring , entertaining film . A Must See ! Grady Harp
513521	3223254	113720	10.0	A Coming of Age Tale for the Characters and the World	ALL THINGS FAIR ( Lust och fägring stor ) turned out to be brilliant Swedish writer / director Bo Widerberg's elegy : after a long history of successful and emotionally captivating films , this film was his last . Watching again some twelve years later gives an entirely different level of appreciation for Widerberg's work . This is a little jewel of a film explores human sexuality at the time of puberty and the enormous impact on the way relationships are viewed , while at the same time it presents a keen insight to the world at war and the equally monstrous side effects in myriad ways . Malmö , Sweden , 1943 . A highschool class of boys is discovering the mysteries of body changes and all-consuming effects puberty has one young teenage men . Outside the classroom World War II threatens and inside the classroom puberty threatens . 15 year old Stig ( Johan Widerberg ) is a handsome , curious lad from a poor family who discovers his first female attraction in the form of his new 37 year old teacher Viola ( Marika Lagercrantz ) , who , despite the impropriety of the situation added to the fact that she is married to a traveling salesman Kjell ( Tomas von Brömssen ) who spends his idle hours drinking and listening to classical music in the kitchen , returns the seductive dance and soon the two are in a physically involved affair . The beauty and fresh novelty of their feelings is captured in the most magical way with little dialog , many embarrassed glances , and significant risks that eventually include Kjell's discovery of their trysts . But as the two are discovered many changes occur : Stig's beloved soldier brother Sigge ( Björn Kjellman ) finally goes off to submarine warfare , Viola becomes less involved and senses the problem she has created , Stig falls under the spell of the tragic Kjell learning music and more from this pathetic man , and Stig finally must face the realities of more proper attraction to Lisbet ( Karin Huldt ) a girl his own age . The actors are superb , the settings are atmospheric , and the era of the 1940s Sweden is perfectly represented . Part of the joy of the film is the musical score that varies from a Handel aria during moments love making , to Brahms ' ' Ein Deutsches Requiem ' , to Mahler's 5th Symphony ' Adagietto ' , to Beethoven's ' Grosse Fugue . ' Widerberg makes it all work in a misty yet sensuous manner . It is a film to own and one to watch often . In Swedish with English subtitles . Grady Harp
513020	3223254	82846	10.0	Some Treasures Refuse to Tarnish	ON GOLDEN POND may be twenty-five years old but the film is of such high quality that it has retained the luminous quality that garnered so many awards when released . It not only has a fine script adapted by the playwright Ernest Thompson from his own play , but it benefits from the sensitive direction by Mark Rydell and a cast of superb actors . The story is rather simple : Ethel ( Katherine Hepburn ) and Norman ( Henry Fonda ) Thayer have returned to their summer home beside Golden Pond and while they are elderly , their lives are still significant . They receive a rare visit from their distant daughter Chelsea ( Jane Fonda ) who stops by with her current boyfriend Bill ( Dabney Coleman ) to drop off Bill's ruffian teenage son Billy ( Doug McKeon ) to reluctantly stay with them while Chelsea and Bill are off to Europe . It is a battle of age differences : Billy sees no future in starting a relationship with the old turkeys and Norman is resentful at the youth's attitude ( Ethel is the wise mediator ) . Slowly but surely the three bond , age differences diminish as negatives and Billy sees Norman as a wise teacher he has never had . Chelsea returns at summer's end with her now husband Bill and faces confrontation with Norman for never being the father she needed : Chelsea knows Norman has spent his life rejecting her because she was not the ' son ' he wanted ! Finally the family reconciles past differences and Ethel and Thayer face their aging and its effects as they listen to the loons on the lake . Hepburn , both Fondas , Coleman and McKeon give outstanding performances , but it is the knowledge that this was H . Fonda's last film and for all intents and purposes Hepburn's last film AND the only time the Fonda father / daughter team acted together on the screen that makes the film even more meaningful . The awards were many and well deserved , not only for the picture , but also for the actors and the production crew . It is a shining example of Hollywood films rising to the standards of Indy movies that makes it such a treat .
513413	3223254	406038	10.0	The Homing Instinct	Loggerheads are turtles , found along the coast of North Carolina , whose lives are unique in that the females always return to the beach where they were born to lay their eggs , hatch their young who in turn by moonlight go out to sea only to return to their origin to repeat the life cycle . The film by the name LOGGERHEADS relies heavily on this phenomenon : it is set in North Carolina and is guided by the young man Mark ( Kip Pardue ) who opens the story sleeping on the beach in Kure Beach , NC where he studies and protects the loggerheads . A complex and challenging film , writer / director Tim Kirkman ( The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me , Dear Jesse ) calls upon a true story to bring up questions of adoption in all the permutations of the triad , homosexuality , religious intolerance , bigotry , AIDS , and the longing for love and forgiveness . Kirkman sets his story in three years - 1999 , 2000 , 2001 - a fact that can be disconcerting until the flow of the film reveals the need to separate the events in time . Mark is befriended by George ( Michael Kelly ) who is a kind young man , owning a motel , and who provides a room for the beach sleeper Mark . Mark quickly informs George that he has AIDS , thinking that George's kindness is a barter . But George is a true friend and their relationship grows slowly and with mutual trust as they learn the secrets of their pasts : George's lover ' drowned ' in a mysterious accident ; Mark ran away from his adoptive parents when they discovered he was gay ; both men are tender and vulnerable souls afraid of further commitment . Simultaneously we are introduced to Grace ( Bonnie Hunt ) , recently recovering from a suicide attempt who longs to connect with the son she was forced to give up for adoption at age 17 , and who lives with her rather rigid mother Sheridan ( Michael Learned ) who believes Grace should not try to discover the son she never knew . We also meet the minister Rev . Robert ( Chris Sarandon ) and his wife Elizabeth ( Tess Harper ) who are fanatics about gay people and even resent their neighbor Ruth ( Ann Pierce ) who places a nude statue of David on her lawn . The couple's son Mark is never discussed and the adoptive parents never communicate with him - but Ruth does . Ruth finally confides that Mark is ill and the wounds of separation open for Elizabeth . Meanwhile Grace has paid a ' finder ' to locate Mark but the finder gives her a sad report . The three years of the story line make exquisite sense at this point as we realize that Kirkman has allowed us to be voyeurs into a human drama of immense substance , one that inexorably binds these disparate characters . The cast is genuinely fine , with Kip Pardue , Michael Kelly , Bonnie Hunt , Tess Harper all giving highly sophisticated performances . But the credit for the impact of this stunning film goes to the writing and directing of Tim Kirkman . He has a way with film that is unique : we can only hope he will continue to make films of this quality , films that tackle difficult issues and are molded into realistic , non-manipulated dramas . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
513391	3223254	408306	10.0	' Home is all that matters '	Attempting to understand what drives people to kill other people for any reason is , in the pit of the soul , a challenging enigma . Whether that ' reason ' is war between countries at odds , protecting one's self when endangered , revenge or vengeance for deeds perpetrated by ' the other ' , for panic in the moment of survival - each of these feels wrong despite the fundamental belief to the contrary at the moment of killing . MUNICH is about killing , about vengeance , about protection of ' home ' , about existence in a world so bifurcated by age-old schisms , and about us . And while absorbing all of the 2 hour plus visual and philosophical information put forth in this epic film , the viewer is so paralyzed by the story that blinking for a second seems irreverent . The tragedy of the 1972 Olympics - the brutal kidnapping and murder of eleven Israeli athletes by masked Arab / Palestinian marauders - is brought to the screen with brave and gutsy realism by a brilliant script by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth based on George Jonas ' book Vengeance : The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team , directed with straightforward , no-nonsense sensitivity to all participants by Steven Spielberg , and brought to life by a cast that simply could not be finer . From the opening of the film sans credits with the Black September act of breaking into the Olympic games in Munich , the film moves swiftly through the formation of an anti-terrorist league of Israeli assassins whose job it is to hunt down the killers and murder them , to the final painfully unsettled end . This is all under the instruction and guidance of Golda Meir ( brilliantly played by Lynn Cohen ) and her advisors . The team of Avner ( Eric Bana ) , Steve ( Daniel Craig ) , Carl ( Ciaran Hinds ) , Robert ( Mathieu Kassovitz ) , Hans ( Hanns Zischler ) , and Mossad Accountant ( Oded Teomi ) are instructed by Ephraim ( Geoffrey Rush ) and stripped of their identities to enter this mission . They roam the world based on information purchased from a secret group led by Louis ( Mathieu Amalric ) and Papa ( Michael Lonsdale ) . Gradually growing into the roles of assassins the group begins to murder each of the perpetrators until their success is noticed by all manner of secret agencies ( including the American CIA ) and the tables are turned : the lives of the Israeli assassins are as endangered as those of the Arab murderers . In a particularly touching moment in the dark , Avner and a Palestinian soldier debate the need for the state of Israel and the opposite need for holding onto home by the Palestinian : it is a moment of writing that sums up the entire Israeli conflict . The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski and the music score by the always fine John Williams add dimensions of atmosphere to this dark film , but it is Spielberg doing what he does best in directing attention to moments in history that will never be buried that makes this phenomenal movie an emotional experience for everyone , no matter their political or religious beliefs . It is simply a brilliant film about the need for Home - that sacred place whether internal or external that maintains the reason to live and even to die for it . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
513189	3223254	369672	10.0	Broken Hopes and Broken Lives : A Study of New Orleans	For those who have read Ronald Everett Capps ' novel ' Off Magazine Street ' and savor the slow , lugubrious , decadent pattern of life in the poor section of New Orleans , then Screenwriter / Director Shainee Gabel's transformation of those ideas into A LOVE SONG FOR BOBBY LONG will certainly satisfy . Though Gabel has manipulated characters names and identification to fit her sensitive interpretation of Capps ' story into a visual manifestation , the changes are sound and serve to make this remarkably fine low budget film a humid , alcoholically lethargic slice of New Orleans as viable as , say , Tennessee Williams . There is a captured ambiance of the South complete with decay , shanties , intermittent rain , and aimless broken lives that sets a fine stage for a rather minimal story . Purslane Hominy Will ( Scarlett Johansson ) is a young high school dropout living in trailer park trash in Florida with a low class boyfriend Lee ( Clayne Crawford ) when she learns of her mother Lorraine's death in New Orleans . Though she hasn't seen or heard from her obese , druggie , songwriter mother in years , she wants to attend her funeral and strikes out for New Orleans . Arriving on the doorstep of her mother's rundown , rotting house , she discovers Bobby Long ( John Travolta ) , an unkempt drunk who once was an English professor in a college in Alabama but fell into oblivion and alcohol when he lost his wife and family . He is living in filth with Lawson Pines ( Gabriel Macht ) who , as Bobby's teaching assistant whom Bobby has deemed gifted , has followed Bobby to write Bobby's biography - a work in progress that has stalemated in favor of alcoholism and disillusionment . Pursey hears that Booby and Lawson were Lorraine's closest friends ( she had invited them to flop in her shabby house , entertained by their low key scholasticism and literature quoting ) , and that Lorraine had willed her home to the three of them . Pursey moves in reluctantly - she has nowhere else to go - and immediately is at odds with her ' roommates ' . Likewise Bobby and Lawson resist Pursey's presence and insist she ' get a life ' by returning to high school , making use of her obvious intellect . The verbal sparing that eventually leads the three to find a sense of family lays the foundation for the predictable conclusion . That is the simplicity of the tale - if it is storyline that is important to you . Gabel's distillation of Capps ' novel is in the atmosphere she creates with these gifted actors . Bobby may be a drunk but he is the spokesman for a neighborhood of sad broken lives . The world is confined to the street that contains the local bar , churches , and graveyards - each of varying importance but all drenched in humidity and frequent rains and alcohol and aimless living . The local bar is tended by Georgiana ( Deborah Kara Unger ) with whom Lawson is having a strained affair . The folk who gather at Bobby's literature-spouting soirees include gardener Cecil ( Dane Rhodes ) , Junior ( David Jensen ) , to mention only a few well-defined characters . That anyone could alter the ennui in the way Pursey changes things is a minor miracle . The minimal music score by Grayson Capps is atmospheric as are the off-screen comments and quotations of great literature of TS Eliot , Robert Frost , WH Auden et al . The cinematography by Eliot Davis is properly claustrophobic and decadent in atmosphere . And while some feel the movie is too long for the minimal story , the length and pacing are in keeping with the traditions and the literature of the South and for this viewer it works exceedingly well . Travolta , Johansson , Macht , and Unger give multifaceted , highly sensitive performances . As for Shainee Gabel ( whose only other film was the controversial ' Anthem ' ) here is a writer and director to watch . The DVD contains some excellent deleted scenes and one of the more informative ' making of ' segments with Gabel , Travolta , Johansson , Macht , and Rhodes speaking with quiet eloquence . Highly recommended .
513319	3223254	476964	10.0	Vengeance is Mine . . . but Who am I ?	Trauma , severe trauma , can unleash aspects of the human personality that may appear as a stranger within . Such is the premise for this well-constructed film by Neil Jordan ( screenplay by Roderick Taylor and Bruce Taylor ) , and while the neither concept of trauma-altered personality or revenge tales is new , THE BRAVE ONE alters the vengeance idea just enough to make it credible and to even draw the viewer into believing that what the character is doing is justified and right ! And that is perhaps the most frightening aspect of this terrifying film . Erica Bain ( Jodie Foster ) is a night radio talk show performer , a woman who walks the city of New York gathering sounds and observing the mysteries of the ' safest big city ' and relates her observations poetically to a large radio audience . Erica is engaged to young physician David ( Naveen Andrews ) and the couple are very much in love . One night on an evening stroll with their dog they are attacked by thugs , beaten with pipes , and David is killed while Erica narrowly survives . Upon awakening from her coma she is devastated by her loss of David and becomes a strangely haunted woman , unable to sleep , unable to get immediate help from the police , and turns to purchasing a gun in an attempt to right the wrongs she has suffered . This new ' person ' or ' stranger within ' happens to witness a murder in a little store and to her amazement she responds by killing the murderer . A similar situation happens on the subway where two thugs threaten people , threaten Erica , and Erica again responds by killing the thugs . She feels driven to avenge the death of her David , but at the same time fears her own inner stranger . Erica returns to her radio show , under changing instructions form her boss Carol ( Mary Steenburgen ) , and finds the changes in her psyche result in bracing her listeners about fear on the streets . In her audience is Detective Mercer ( Terrence Howard ) who has personal problems related to the fact that he has been unable to arrest a known killer . Mercer connects with Erica in various ways , she interviews him for her show , and the two bond . Erica trusts Mercer , wants to share what she is doing , yet hears his frustration about not being able to seek his own brand of revenge frustration against the oily killer he pursues , and decides to eliminate that trauma for Mercer . As the tension builds , the identity of Erica's assailants is discovered , and how she deals with these thugs ( and with Mercer's interaction in the solution ) forms the surprising ending for the film . Too little has been written and said about the quality of performances from both Foster and Howard in this tense thriller . These two actors deliver performances so sensitive in execution that memories of previous similar films evaporate . This is a tough film to watch for all the violence not only on the screen but from within the characterizations by the actors ( with the capable direction of Neil Jordan ) , but it is for this viewer one of the strongest films of the year . Perhaps now that the DVD can be viewed within the safety of the home more people will pay attention to a film that deserves awards . Grady Harp
513238	3223254	119608	10.0	The Belly of the Beast	NOTE : According to the dictionary : Mandragora is 1 ) a plant of nightshade family : a plant with a forked root resembling a human body that was formerly believed to have magical powers and was made into a drug and 2 ) a 14th century alteration of medieval Latin mandragora , influenced by man , drake " dragon " ( from its emetic and narcotic properties ) . MANDRAGORA , the astonishing film from the Czech Republic written by Wiktor Grodecki ( who also directs ) and David Svec ( who also acts in the film ) , is aptly named : mandragora is the world of male prostitution that seduces young lads with promises of money and ultimately poisons them with the burning disease of loss of self respect and ultimately of life . Marek ( Miroslav Caslavka in a stunning performance ) is a beautiful 15-year-old kid from a little village in the Czech Republic who has aligned himself with petty criminals to have better things such as classy clothing , a lad whose single father ( Jirí Kodes ) demands he stay in school ( yet is always in the background to salvage Marek's errant life situations ) and who seems to be prepping his son for a better life . Marek hates school , which he sees as merely a path to be a welder like his father . The father and son collide after another crime spree and Marek leaves home for the big city promises of Prague . Once in Prague Marek is observed by the pimp Honza ( Pavel Skripal ) who follows Marek , knowing that Marek's future in the city is doomed without Honza's ' protection ' . Within a day's time Marek's luck with the slot machines dries up and Honza convinces him to be his ' rabbit ' - a male prostitute . Marek's first encounter with an American ' john ' ends disastrously and the beaten Marek returns to the streets where he encounters a fellow hustler David ( David Svec ) . Together they forge an alliance to escape Honza's compound and begin a life of successful prostitution . They are bonded ( the probability of Marek's actually being gay and physically attracted to David is strong ) and together they encounter all manner of unseemly characters involved in the underbelly of Prague's male prostitution life . Characters weave in and out of Marek's and David's life , each time leaving scars that grow more visible as does the threat of drug problems and AIDS . They eventually consent to embrace the lowest level of making gay porn where the cruel director forces Marek to be sodomized by David . They are raided by the police and Honza reappears as Marek's nemesis . Through a series of drug-induced hallucinations and dreams Marek envisions what his future holds and his descent is stamped . Yet at this point Marek's father journeys to Prague in search of his son , discovers his life style , is terrified and angry and tangentially passes Marek in a critical final scene that is devastatingly sad . This film is dark , frank , cruel , realistic , and sweats with the evil of the belly of the beast that is Prague's underworld . Yet the direction is so fine and , equally important , the acting by Miroslav Caslavka so sensitive that we as the audience are swept into an overwhelming compassion for these unfortunate lads whose seemingly only hope for a better life is one of humiliating degradation . MANDRAGORA is a no holds barred examination of a dark life that maintains a precarious balance between caricature and character development . Yes , it is lengthy at 126 minutes , in need of editing in areas , has faulty subtitles , and a strange musical score by Wolfgang Hammerschmid who extrapolates Puccini's ' Nessun dorma ' and Bach's ' Erbarme dich ' and ' Ruhe sanft ' from the St Matthew Passion for heavy effects , and very dark cinematography by Vladimír Holomek , but despite these sidebar problems , they only slightly mar the overall impact of a very important film .

513172	3223254	423510	10.0	Understanding FDR : Physical Challenges Offer Triumph	WARM SPRINGS is one of the finest films ever produced by HBO and clearly belongs on the theatrical screens . But until that happens the news of the release of the DVD should allow those who missed this phenomenal film to feel greeted with well-earned joy . Writer Margaret Nagle and Director Joseph Sargent have created an isolated time in the life of Franklin Delano Roosevelt , the inception of his polio at age 39 and the treatment of his impairment at Warm Springs , Georgia , and use this potential tragedy to demonstrate how a man of means and high political aspirations was humbled by a debilitating disease only to find healing and consolation at the hands of ' the common people ' , a change in his priorities that marked his popular success as a President who inherited the leadership of a country devastated by depression and war . Kenneth Branagh is superlative as FDR , finding just the right amount of bravado and churlishness and womanizing while continuing to be the man of great potential and a loving husband to Eleanor ( a surprisingly terrific Cynthia Nixon ) . His overbearing mother Sara Delano Roosevelt ( Jane Alexander who is still remembered as a perfect ' Eleanor ' in the older ' Franklin and Eleanor ' ) tries her best to belittle Eleanor , only to enhance Eleanor's blossoming into the world respected , humanistic First Lady she became . But much of the action is aptly placed at the healing resort of Warm Springs , a run down hot springs operated by Tom Loyless ( Tim Blake Nelson ) and the place where Helena Mahoney ( Kathy Bates ) nursed FDR back to health . The importance of this spot grows through the film and through FDR's life and in the end it is the beneficiary of his estate . Watching Branagh tumble from political barnstormer to reluctant patient to humanized President is a heartwarming venture . His supporting cast is excellent - Bates , Nixon , Alexander , Nelson as well as David Paymer , Deborah Calloway Duke , Danny Connell , and many others . The direction by Joseph Sargent is one of simplicity , purity of purpose , and highly respectful of his story and his view of history . This is an important film . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
513390	3223254	402399	10.0	Awe : The Quiet Curiosity and Fear When Worlds First Meet	Terrence Malick is a master of understatement and it is that quality of his writing and directing that makes THE NEW WORLD so luminous an experience for the viewer . Though the historical material in this film has been told and written and filmed to exhaustion , Malick finds that awe and wonder as the Old World of the King James ' England puts ashore on the pure and unsoiled land of Virginia of 1607 to an audience of naively innocent ' naturals ' who are as fascinated with the arrivals of the visitors as the English are curious yet fearful of the ' savages ' they may face in this new place . This is an interior film that just happens to be filmed in the wonders of the meadows and rivers and seaside of nature resplendent . Malick has wisely elected to have the meeting between the naturals and the English remain in their own languages : the Indians speak a beautiful language that is not translated for the audience , a fact that adds to the feeling of ' the other ' on both sides . And it is this separateness that makes the story credible . Upon landing Captain Newport ( Christopher Plummer ) cancels the scheduled hanging of Captain John Smith ( Colin Farrell ) and sets rules for the newly formed Jamestown , which he soon leaves to return to England , leaving Captain Smith in charge . It is Smith's duty to meet with the naturals in an attempt to gain needed food supplies . The magic that occurs with this meeting of ' the stranger ' with the naturals is the epitome of discovery . Smith is saved from execution by the Chief Powhatan's ( August Schellenberg ) favored daughter Pocahontas ( Q'Orianka Kilcher ) and lives with the naturals , learning their innocence of spirit and falling in love with Pocahontas . But Smith is returned to his fort , suffers misadventures among his own men , sustains attacks by the disenchanted naturals , and eventually returns to England , telling his friend to inform Pocahontas that he has drowned . Pocahontas is outcast from her community because of her kindness to the English and is placed in Jamestown where she is ' assimilated ' by the new arrival of English . Among the new arrivals is John Rolfe ( Christian Bale ) who falls in love with Pocahontas and though she does not love Rolfe she consents to the arranged marriage because Rolfe is kind and because she believes her beloved Smith to be dead . The two have a child and Rolfe takes his little family to England where Pocahontas is presented at court for her invaluable aid to the English . She discovers Smith is still alive , dies , and Rolfe and son return to Jamestown . No spoilers , these : this is historically accurate reporting of stories we have all known from grade school . All of this majestic story is told primarily in silence with the stream of conscious dialogue from each character spoken in voice over . The sounds of nature accompany the action in an eerily perfect manner . Many have praised James Horner's musical score for this film and it is a score that contributes to the beauty of the film : the fact is there is little original music here , the use of Wagner's ' Das Rheingold ' accompanies the extended opening and recurs for the big moments while Mozart's Piano Concerto No . 23 is used extensively for the quiet moments . Yes , it works , but there is not much other original music to praise . But that is the only quibble with those who have raved about this film . It does weave its spell under Malick's understanding eye and is beautifully cast with first-rate actors who are asked to render their characters physically and with their eyes rather than words . Farrell , Kilcher , Bale , Thewlis , Plummer and the large supporting cast are exemplary . What , then , Malick has given us in this majestic film is that sense of wonder of the unknown , the thin thread between curiosity and threat that spins the coming together of cultures . And that sense of awe is still propelling the forces of the world today . If only all such interactions would hold the respect of this initial encounter . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
512971	3223254	411270	10.0	The Silences within the Psyche of a Life in Transition	' De battre mon coeur s'est arrêté ' ( ' The Beat that my Heart Skipped ' ) is another superb and delicate character-driven film from French writer / director Jacques Audiard ( ' Read My Lips ' ) and his collaborator Tonino Benacquista . How this director can take such potentially fragile subjects and create enormously powerful and indelible characters would indicate that he is one of cinema's truly important artists . The story evolves as Thomas Seyr ( Romain Duris ) is seen as a member of a real estate scam working with smarmy associates who buy and sell buildings at the expense and eviction of poor tenants . The work is distasteful but Thomas is following the lead of his father Robert ( Niels Arestrup ) , a man on the skids who depends on Thomas to do his ' collections ' . Thomas loathes the work but is devoted to his rundown father . We discover that Thomas ' mother , a former concert pianist , is dead when Thomas encounters his old piano teacher who urges him to practice despite his ten year absence from playing and to audition for a new career . A light of hope goes on in Thomas ' psyche and he is lead to a Chinese immigrant pianist Miao Lin ( Linh Dan Pham ) who takes him on as a pupil to prepare him for his anticipated audition . As Thomas practices , his world of crime does not abate and he is intermittently pulled away from his passion for the piano by his old partners as well as his father's continuing need for his ' dirty services ' . He is torn between the life he has been leading and the promises of a career with his mother's ( and his ) passion for beauty in music . When the partition tenuously separating these dual lives is broken , Thomas struggles to find his way back to music . The ending is unexpected and keeps in step with the verismo of the screenplay . Romain Duris is a major talent and delivers the kind of performance that indicates he is becoming a powerhouse of an actor . But the real star of the film is the director who knows how to relate a glimpse of a man's life in subtle , quiet ways despite the accompanying background of violence . It is a delicate balance and Jacques Audiard makes it work . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
512874	3223254	117039	10.0	One of the Finest Examples of Filmed History	Neil Jordan always manages to make films that are edgy , pungent , and intensely accurate in defining the motivation of his characters ( ' The Crying Game ' , ' The Butcher Boy ' , ' The End of the Affair ' , etc ) and in MICHAEL COLLINS Jordan has not only directed but also wrote a docudrama that stands with the finest . It is simply a major achievement in cinematic art . The brief life of Michael Collins ( he was killed when he was but 31 years of age ) completely changed the history of Ireland and the British rule of that country . Collins introduced the democracy of the Irish Republic and ended a long era of fighting and rebellion . A man of passionate convictions and mesmerizing idealism and compassion , Collins ' memory is still regarded by both the Irish and the British as a 20th century hero . The brilliant script is placed in the exceptionally competent hands of Liam Neeson as Collins with top flight support from Stephan Rea , Aidan Quinn , Alan Rickman , Jonathan Rhys-Meyers , Charles Dance , and yes , even Julia Roberts ! The fighting scenes are so well done they become artistic , due primarily to the constantly excellent cinematography by Chris Menges . Elliot Goldenthal's musical score ( with some added moments by Sinéad O'Connor ) not only enhances the film but stands alone as a fine orchestral work . Truly on of the best historic films ever released . Grady Harp
512670	3223254	974554	10.0	Dignity and Sensuality : Intoxication	' When you make love to a woman you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life . ' Few American writers have been able to examine the fear and rage and desperation of aging as eloquently as Philip Roth , and as with another of his novels brought to life on the screen ( ' The Human Stain ' ) , here Nicholas Meyer has beautifully adapted Roth's ' The Dying Animal ' with all the visceral immediacy and poetry of the novel about the terror and compassion of May / December relationships . Isabel Coixnet has managed to guide her gifted set of actors through this story as though it were a ballet . The result is one of the more beautiful ' love stories ' ever filmed . David Kepesh ( Ben Kingsley , in a performance of tremendous power and sensitivity ) is an aging author , teacher and art critic , a man who has not learned the secret of lasting relationships but who retains his animal sex drive despite his passing years : he survives time's passing by a patterned assignation with Carolyn ( Patricia Clarkson ) , an aging successful traveling business woman who drops in for sensual gratification when in town . David's closest friend is Pulitzer prize winning poet George O'Hearn ( Dennis Hopper ) who serves as his alter ego and as his confidant in David's problematic life . Into David's classroom comes Consuela Castillo ( the ravishingly beautiful and gifted Penélope Cruz ) who gains David's focus not only for her radiant beauty but also for her intelligence . Struggling with his advanced years ( David is over thirty years older than Consuela ) , a courtship dance begins and it is the emergence of this romance that forms the story . How Consuela alters David's behavior and his discovery of the need for connection outside of the bedroom is related as a journey through David's mind . The manner in which the transformation changes every member of the story is what makes this film so very memorable . Kingsley is brilliant in this probing examination of the aging man's psyche , Cruz SHOULD have received her Oscar for this performance rather than the film that honored her , Clarkson continues to be one of our best actresses on the screen , Peter Sarsgaard makes a brief but important appearance , and David Hopper manages to step out of his predictable past roles and offer a character of true compassion and finesse . The film is magnificently photographed ( Jean-Claude Larrieu ) and the music score thankfully is almost completely devoted to the works of Erik Satie ( Gnossiennes ) , Beethoven ( Diabelli Variations ) , Vivaldi ( cantatas with Phillipe Jaroussky ) - all edited by the director Isabel Coixnet . It all works well . This is one of the finer films of 2008 and deserves a wide audience of people who love quality film-making . Grady Harp
513197	3223254	323807	10.0	The Inner Sanctum of Family , The Durability of Love	RECORDATI DI ME is a beautifully written and constructed film by Italian director Gabriele Muccino about the workings of a ' normal middle class ' family and the bonds and challenges that peak at the time of fragmentation of the family unit that accompanies 1 ) middle age of the parents and 2 ) departure of the children at the end of high school . How those crises and adjustments inform the durability of the family unit makes up this thoroughly engrossing and touching film . Carlo Ristuccia ( Fabrizio Bentivoglio ) is the father embedded in a life long job that is mundane and not at all in line with his dreams of being a writer ( he has been writing a novel for years , yet unfinished ) . His wife Giulia ( Laura Morante ) is a committed mother but longs to return to the acting stage she abandoned for marriage . Their two children are Valentina ( Nicolette Romanoff ) who is determined to become a glamorous TV star and Paolo ( Silvio Muccino ) who is aimless in his desire for a life of meaning , a life which would prove he is not as unexceptional as he views himself . Gradually each member of the family encounters escape routes : Carlo meets his old girlfriend Alessia ( Monica Bellucci ) and begins an affair with her ; Giulia is asked to audition for a part in a play directed by one Alfredo ( Gabriele Lavia ) who makes her feel desirable and noticed ; Valentina sleeps around to land a part in a TV giveaway show ' Ali Babbi ' , and Paolo attempts to attach himself to a girlfriend by planning a birthday party with contraband hashish which he feels will make him appear important in the eyes of his peers . As each of these crises reaches a peek , Carlo sustains a back injury while fleeing his home and his resultant hospitalization results in altered perceptions of what the family is all about . The twists and turns of the plot are , of course , far more involved than this short synopsis , and it is the development of each of these characters and the way that they approach change that makes the film work so well . The acting is excellent and the direction is past paced even for a two and a half hour movie . Yes , much of this has been said before , but the wit and pathos combine to create a story well worth telling and watching . It is a story about dreams , lost possibilities , and the need to fulfill them .
512980	3223254	328844	10.0	Family : Obligations , Commitments , Consequences	Writer / director Per Fly is a strong filmmaker from Denmark who is unafraid to make controversial statements that challenge certain ' family values ' sentiments prevalent in this country . In this brilliantly written , directed and acted film he manages to reveal the inner destruction of a family under whose surface is an institution of envy . It is a riveting film that despite its in excess of two-hour length keeps us riveted to our seats in its never-ending exploration of the darker side of familial machinations . Christoffer ( Ulrich Thomsen ) has escaped his Danish family and is comfortably ensconced in Stockholm as a successful restaurateur , living with the beautiful actress Maria ( Lisa Werlinder ) whose love for life extends beyond the fulfilling pleasures of the boudoir . Their bliss is interrupted by an unexpected visit from Chrisoffer's father who briefly spends time with the couple , happy for their state of success in all things . Upon his departure Christoffer receives a phone call that his father has hung himself and his presence is demanded in Denmark . Christoffer and Maria fly home to the matriarch of the family , Christoffer's mother Anneliese ( the brilliant Ghita Norby ) who immediately takes charge of the family , demands that Christoffer take over the failing family steel company thus skipping over Christoffer's designated brother-in-law Ulrick ( Lars Brygmann ) , a fact that tears at Christoffer's sister Benedikte ( Karina Skands ) . Taking the position of head of the family business would mean his giving up his dreams in Stockholm , negate Maria's burgeoning acting career , and placing Christoffer in the ominous position of having to fire longtime employees and make changes that would decimate many - not the least of which would be Christoffer's character . But Anneliese is strong and gets her way and thus the destruction of Christoffer's humanity and life begins . Christoffer is able to merge the company with a French company and make the family business successful . But at what a cost ? Maria leaves him after they have a child , Benedikte collides with him over his ruining her life with Ulrick , and Christoffer moves to France where he drowns his sorrows in alcohol . Per Fly is not one to tidy up all of the loose ends of a family disintegration : he leaves the end results of a bad decision up to the audience to figure out . It is this respect for the audience that endears this artist to us . The script is brilliantly written , the acting is superb , and the direction is tight and sensitive to the storyline . In every way this is a film worthy of our attention , not only as an art piece , but also as a means of re-examining ' family values ' that here are presented in quite a different light than our usual reference phrase suggests . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
513680	3223254	188128	10.0	A Little Town in South Wales is Bursting with Life and Stories	VERY ANNIE MARY is a quirky little film written and directed by Sara Sugarman that manages to delve into myriad fantasies and manners and crushed dreams and come out with a thoroughly tender , warm hearted and funny result . There are more interesting characters of all types in this story , each of whom could be expanded into a film all their own . After a rollicking opening sequence of a bakery delivery van topped with speakers blasting Puccini's ' Nessun dorma ' over lovely countryside of Wales - the driver is the town baker Jack Pugh ( Jonathan Pryce ) who wears a rubber mask and bloated suit that mimic Pavarotti singing along with a recording - we meet the town folk . Jack's daughter Annie Mary ( Rachel Griffiths ) is in her 30s , stuck as a surrogate wife and slave to her father and his bakery business . She seems loopy and perhaps retarded ( socially indeed , if not a bit mentally ) and has borne the brunt of her father's scorn since her mother died when she was fifteen , just when Annie had won a singing competition judged by Pavarotti . The loss of her mother places her in the role of ' wife ' to the dastardly John who daily convinces her she is a nothing while he pursues his avocation of singing for the townsfolk as the Voice of the Valley . Annie's only remnant of her past survives in her teaching voice lessons to such odd folk as Hob ( Ioan Gruffudd ) and Nob ( Matthew Rhys ) , gay friends of hers with delusions of Hollywood . Her closest friend is teenage Bethan ( Joanna Page ) who is ill . Annie Mary spies a house on the market , desperately wants to get out from under her father's control to make a life of her own , and shares this with Bethan . During one of his concerts John collapses with a stroke and it appears Annie's dreams of independence are crushed . The townsfolk decide they want to befriend Bethan and monies are gathered to send Bethan on her ' dream ' - a trip to Disneyland . In a hilarious talent show meant to raise funds for the Disneyland trip Annie and her friends win the contest and the money meant for Bethan's trip is entrusted to Annie . Annie again stumbles and squanders the funds on her own dreams by buying sensual satisfaction . Broken by her own mistake , Annie confesses to Bethan and Bethan replies that her only dream before dying is to hear Annie sing . And sing Annie does , in probably the most touching performance of Puccini's ' O mio bambino caro ' . At last Annie Mary has regained her self-respect and has a glimpse of her own life . The closing multiple resolutions of the film are full of surprises of the best kind . Every character in this delightful film is well acted , but there are moments by some , like the very weird , besotted minister ( Kenneth Griffith ) , that certainly deserve awards for brilliance . VERY ANNIE MARY is a rich , multilayered , magical film with outstanding performances by Rachel Griffiths and Jonathan Pryce . The only fault one might find is that much of the dialogue is indecipherable due to the Welsh accents that challenge the ear ! Highly recommended . Grady Harp
513733	3223254	308595	10.0	A Fascinating Story , Sifting through Legend and Fact about Napoleon's Last Days	Director Antoine de Caunes has adapted Rene Mansor's fine screenplay concerning the enigma that still exists as to the final resting place of Napoleon Bonaparte into a film that relates the period of history from 1816 to 1840 during which time the bifurcated responses of the British and French to the legend of Napoleon initiated the scandal that still piques our interest . Opening in 1816 Napoleon ( the brilliant Philippe Torreton ) is imprisoned on the island of St . Helena along with his most trusted supporters and various citizens who elected to follow him into exile - with an eye on Napoleon's fortune when he dies . There is a new British Governor appointed , Hudson Lowe ( Richard E . Grant ) , who is steely and determined to prevent Napoleon's escape and yes , even protect the British government from the costly extended prison expenditures a prolonged exile will produce . Lowe appoints Basil Heathcote ( Jay Rodan ) to sit in watch of the Emperor / General only to come under the spell of the mysterious Napoleon and the spell of a young girl Betsy Balcombe ( Siobhan Hewlett ) who is in love with Napoleon . Others among Napoleon's party include the Montholons ( Stephane Freiss and Elsa Zylberstein ) the latter of whom Napoleon keeps as his mistress and impregnates , Cipriani ( Bruno Putzulu ) his butler and half brother , Ali ( Igor Skreblin ) his bodyguard , Marshal Bertand ( Roschdy Zem ) his aide de camp , among others . Napoleon's self perception as the Emperor makes him unavailable to close scrutiny and rumors fly about his proposed escapes and about the British idea of poisoning him . There is great mystery surrounding Napoleon's ultimate death and burial and this mystery is what drives the story in flash forward sequences to the investigation of Napoleon's ultimate exhumation to see if the man buried in Les Invalides in Paris is actually Napoleon Bonaparte - and if not , where is the true Napoleon buried ? The period atmosphere on St . Helena is scrupulously recreated , allowing a superb playing ground for the many fine performances by an excellent cast . We see Napoleon as we've never seen him , a multi-dimensional character with whom we , as viewers , tend to sympathize . This is not only due to the fine script but also to the unique portrayal by Philippe Torreton . The film is in both French and English , with English subtitles for the French only . And therein lies the fault of this otherwise superb film . The ambient sounds of the crashing sea and the annoyingly loud musical score by Stephan Eicher cover the English dialogue to such an extent that it cannot be heard most of the time . This is a film that would greatly benefit from re-mastering to add English subtitles for the entire film AND by making it available in full screen instead of the widescreen that reduces much of the action to miniaturization ! Otherwise , this is a superb period piece that opens questions about historical accuracy that invite investigation . Grady Harp
513074	3223254	834938	10.0	A Powerful Story About Immigrant Journeys	SANGRE DE MI SANGRE ( also known as PADRE NUESTRO ) is a fast-paced , raw , and rather brutal indictment against the cruelty immigrants face upon entering this country . Written and directed by Christopher Zalla the film may cover territory becoming a bit overexposed in cinema of late , but the story is so well told and acted that it rises to the top of the films currently available about the experiences immigrants ( from Mexico , in this case ) endure in trying to better their lives under the torch of the Statue of Liberty ! The film opens in Mexico where a young criminal Juan ( Armando Hernández ) narrowly escapes his pursuers by jumping over the border fence and landing in a situation where a coyote ( corrupt border guard ) is loading his truck with immigrants to transport them for cash to New York . The street-wise Juan is one of many stuffed into a truck and happens to sit by a young illiterate lad his age named Pedro ( Jorge Adrián Espíndola ) who is on his way to meet his father who lives in New York ( ' a man who owns a restaurant ' ) but whom Pedro has never seen ( he carries with him a letter to his father from his recently deceased mother ) . Through all manner of staging errors and transportation glitches , the two young boys , full of dreams of a better future in America , land in New York . Juan loses his money and his ID and steels from his newfound friend . Pedro encounters a streetwalker named Magda ( Paola Mendoza ) who promises to help Pedro find his father Diego ( Jesús Ochoa ) . But Jaun has found the dishwasher Diego first , claims to be his son , and causes confusion and discord in Diego's life . How the two lads manage to survive the complexities of life in Brooklyn and are swept up in the raw life of crime that surrounds the lives of illegal immigrants makes for a complicated story , but one filled with unforgettable characters and emotions . This film had an unfortunately brief run in the theaters . It is a well-made film in every aspect and deserves wider audience which now , on DVD , it just may reach . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
512974	3223254	377084	10.0	' If music be the language of love , play on ! ' : A Fairy Tale	Short stories often make better films than full novels as is evident in the case of JD Locke's ' Ladies in Lavender ' as adapted for the screen and directed by the multi-talented Charles Dance . Given the barest outline of a quiet little idea of a ' fairy tale ' , LADIES IN LAVENDER becomes an unfolding meditation of quiet lives altered by an incident that awakens sleeping needs and emotions . Ursula ( Judi Dench ) and Janet ( Maggie Smith ) are elderly sisters living a quiet life of gardening , strolling the cliffs and beach of Cornwall , knitting , and reading . Their bumpy housekeeper Dorcas ( Miriam Margolyes ) cooks , cleans , shops , and chatters in a wonderful Cornish brogue , allowing the sisters to live an otherwise isolated life - isolated from history , personal emotions , and vulnerabilities . After a storm Ursula spies a figure on the beach below their home and the two descend to find an unconscious handsome young man whom they rescue , house , nurture , mend a broken ankle and ultimately become doting adorers . The young man Andrea ( Daniel Brühl ) finally awakens , speaks no English as he is Polish , and his charming ways attract inner emotions in both sisters . Janet studies some German and is able to speak with Andreas , while Ursula pastes English words on items in his room to teach him English . He mends and it is discovered that he is a concert violinist who was shipwrecked while striving to go to America . A Russian visitor to the town , Olga ( Natascha McElhone ) , the requisite ' evil witch ' for a fairy tale , hears Andreas play , informs him she has a cousin who is a famous violinist , and attracts him away from Cornwall to London where he ultimately gives his own concert . Those are the bare facts of the film's story . The magic lies not in the story itself but in the submerged feelings of the two sisters . Ursula , having never been in love in her youth , falls in love with Andrea , fully aware that there is no possibility of consummation . She feels long desired emotional attachment to the lad and the stirring in her breast is overwhelming to her . Janet , who once loved but lost that love to death , likewise falls for Andrea . It is this sibling rivalry over the passion for Andrea that provides some of the most touching and understated brilliant acting moments ever recorded on film . There is a scene where , resting from a stroll on the cliffs , Andrea rests with his head on Ursula's lap , perhaps the first physical contact with a man she has ever known , and the gentility of the slow and reticent placement of her hand on Andrea's resting head is a crystal of acting magic . How the sisters cope with this time with Andrea and his eventual leaving for his career is the climax of the film . And touching and understated it is . Judi Dench and Maggie Smith give pitch perfect characterizations , creating two lovely beings we will never forget . Likewise Daniel Brühl is superb in a role far different from his usual German repertoire ( Goodbye Lenin ! , The Edukators , Love in Thoughts ) and manages to create the illusion that he is actually playing the violin ( while the true artist is Joshua Bell in some stunning performances ) . The atmosphere of Cornwall is magically captured by Dance and his cinematographer Peter Biziou with assistance from Ed Rutherford . Nigel Hess has written a musical score , incorporating well-known classical violin works as well as his own hauntingly beautiful music that adds immeasurably to the film's success . LADIES IN LAVENDER is not a major blockbuster of a success nor does it try to be . It is simply a exquisitely crafted and acted fairy tale that gently reminds us that age does not prevent the heart from responding to that most beautiful of emotions , Love . Highly recommended .

513504	3223254	390080	10.0	An Intelligent , Well Written Controversial Film	HARRY AND MAX goes where films have dared ( at least American films ) : consensual incestuous relationships between two brothers . Writer / director Christopher Münch ( ' The Sleepy Time Gal ' , ' The Hours and Times ' , ' Color of a Brisk and Leaping Day ' ) has previously proved that he is unafraid to take on tough subject matter and make it poetically beautiful . In HARRY AND MAX he has created an intelligent reverie about hopes , dreams , expectations , disappointments , and filial love that is as fascinating as it is unique . Max ( Cole Williams ) is a 16-year-old teen idol whose career is managed by his mother ( Michelle Phillips ) . His 23-year-old brother Harry ( Bryce Johnson ) began the family trend toward teen band idols and now is living on his past glories in music trips to the still-adoring masses in Japan while he sinks into alcoholism . Max longs for companionship and more with Harry and as the film opens we find them on a long-awaited camping trip in California's San Gabriel mountains , exploring the old Mt Lowe Railway . Their similarities and differences unfold in natural , unforced conversation and when night falls and they retire to their tent , Max makes physical overtures to Harry , overtures Harry does not resist . It is clear through occult references to a family outing in Bermuda that the two have had intimate relations but the details are intentionally left foggy . For the remainder of the weekend trip the two brothers confide their family problems ( Harry never felt as accepted as Max and left home early on ) , Max's gay affair with 40-year-old Josiah ( Tom Gilroy ) , Harry's current affair with Roxanne ( Roni Deitz ) and his mishandled affair with Nikki ( Rain Phoenix ) , a girl who subsequently married and divorced and is now a close friend with Max . Once the inherent tensions are blocked out , the two brothers explore the current paramours of the other : Harry seduces Josiah , Max attempts to seduce Nikki , and the secret of the brothers ' incestuous relationship becomes open knowledge . Harry truly loves Max and Max returns that love but feels Harry must find his own life without leaning on Max's new idol popularity . The final solutions are unveiled in a time jump two years later when Harry and Max and Max's lover Jordan ( Justin Zachary ) meet in a conversation that more fully explains the differences and similarities between the two brothers . Christopher Münch keeps the story rolling with casual precision , using effective sun-drenched flashbacks to illuminate the boys ' childhood . He has garnered fine performances from his cast : Cole Williams and Bryce Johnson are superb and cameo roles by Michelle Phillips , Justin Zachary , and Tom Gilroy are first rate . The only weak link is Rain Phoenix who mimes her way through the pivotal role of Nikki , reducing the tension when it should be building . The sexual scenes are handled with utmost sophistication , sensual without being graphic . In all , this is a terrific little film , small in budget and technique but enormous in thought and impact . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
513195	3223254	400063	10.0	A Film Even More Powerful for its Simplicity of Presentation	The gruesome tragedy of the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 absolutely must become public knowledge if we are to maintain the watch for symptoms of similar acts in the present and the future . HOTEL RWANDA was a fine film that capitalized on the heroism of one man , and justly so , for his selfless vision that saved many lives . But as far as a film that relates the same story without the emphasis on one hero , SOMETIMES IN APRIL is for this reviewer more powerful : the genocide speaks more loudly because it focuses on the victims . Writer / Director Raoul Peck has created a stunning impact with this film made for HBO . The details of the history of the rebellion of the Tutsis against the Hutus is clearly explained and made far more understandable than in previous efforts . Peck wisely utilizes the talents of Idris Elba and Carole Karemera as the husband and wife of mixed marriage and it is their story of survival and witness that makes this examination of Rwanda so intense . Oris Erhuero and Debra Winger among others feel completely committed to this story in the way they bring honesty and credibility to their roles . Photographed on location , this film is at first a country beautiful to look at and then the beauty of the land filled with corpses is nearly unbearable . The contrast is typical of the way Raoul Peck has sculpted this important film . By Hollywood standards as well as by Public Information standards , this is a film that should be seen by everyone as not only a fine movie but also an important documentation of a tragedy that should have never been ignored .
513158	3223254	119280	10.0	A Strong Period Drama and Another Brilliant Characterization by Judi Dench	MRS . BROWN as written by Jeremy Brock and directed by John Madden ( Proof , Shakespeare in Love , Captain Corelli's Mandolin ) is a sprightly , entertaining and engrossing study of a moment in the life of enigmatic Queen Victoria . Selecting an outstanding production crew and a fine cast this film succeeds on every level and once again proves to us that Judi Dench is one of the finest actresses on the stage or screen today . The story revolves around the time when Queen Victoria's beloved husband Prince Albert dies resulting in a clinical depression in the queen . She leaves London with her entourage to grieve at Balmoral Castle . There her Scottish Highlander servant John Brown ( Billy Connolly ) nurses her back to normalcy but in the meanwhile sets up the appearance of an affair that scandalized the British Isles . Disraeli ( Antony Sher ) visits in an attempt to right the situation but it is Brown's strong personality - an equal match for the wise and wily Victoria - that alters the course of events that returns Queen Victoria to her proper station . Dench and Connolly play so well off each other that their relationship has a wealth of charm , tenderness , bite , wit , and solidity . The supporting cast includes a fine turn by Gerard Butler as Archie Brown , John's supportive and playful brother . The costumes are superb and the cinematography by Richard Greatrex captures the atmosphere of the cloying indoor spaces as well as the freedom of the vast coastline vistas . Stephen Warbeck is responsible for the well-integrated musical score . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
