484895	1416505	60666	1.0	What was that ?	Never has a movie been so dumb , silly , bad , ugly , awful at the same time . Is " Manos , the Hands of Fate " really that bad as everyone says it is ? Yes , it is and maybe even worse . What makes " Manos , the Hands of Fate " a bad movie is that it was made with no talent or imagination , quite sad to watch really . I don't know what is the worst ; The acting , the script , the sets , the editing . The most likely answer is that it's all just simply plain bad . Especially the editing is the worst I have ever seen . Some scene's seem to be endless while nothing is shown at it at all and most of the time they don't even have anything to do with the movie . The movie is full with this long endless shots that are really about nothing , very boring to say the least . The story is just laughable bad , if you asked me what it is about I think I can not even explain it . It's just about nothing and lot's of it makes no sense at all . It feels like someone is poking you in the brains with a stick . The movie is full with silly moments that makes you think ; What the is that ? The actors are by far some of the worst ever . They show absolutely no talent or what so ever . Then we come to the only good thing about the movie : Torgo . Oh boy what a character ! I doubt it was intentional but this guy is absolutely hilarious with his strange ticks and movements . He alone makes this movie still watchable . He is a real classic . I also must admit that I liked the ending a lot . I even found it surprising and shocking but a good ending can't save a bad movie . Congratulations Hal Warren , you created one of the very worst movies of all time , you make an Ed Wood movie seem like a masterpiece . A must see for bad movie lovers .
484817	1416505	55452	2.0	Ed Wood's last attempt at ' serieus ' movie making .	Dialog in Ed Wood movies are often among the worst you'll ever hear in any movie . It's tone cringing and hilariously bad at times . Especially also hilarious how Ed Wood tried to put in humor into this movie . Wood perhaps wasn't the worst director of all time but he might very well be the worst writer of all time . This movie its story is also really confusing to follow , since it just doesn't make much sense . It's a movie with many sub-plots , rather than one clear main plot and the movie focuses too much on too many different characters , rather than it has one clear and likable main character . The movie misses a Bela Lugosi , Tor Johnson or Vampira . But I have to hand Ed Wood one thing . Some of his movies handle for its time some sensitive and daring themes . He previously for instance did this before with his movie " Glenn or Glenda " , which was about transvestites and more or less also with his movie " Plan 9 From Outer Space " which had some social criticism in it . " The Sinister Urge " concentrates on the world of pornography . Of course not a subject that would often be handled ' seriously ' in ' 60's movies . Ironicaly enough Wood himself would land into the world of soft-core porn movie making after this film as a director , writer and ( unfortunatly also ) actor . It's especially since this movie tries to show how ' evil ' pornography is . It even turns people into serial killers . Especially the dialog explaining how evil it all is , is extremely moralistic and completely totally horrible . I actually also would suspect that the portrayal of the porn industry is far from the truth and how it was at the time . So it's also really doubtful that Ed Wood actually did some research for his movie . Continuety is a big problem and the editing often doesn't make a whole lot of sense . Character positions and even car models change suddenly in between different cuts . It's also quite hilarious that the movie at times recycles some of its sequence and of course Wood also uses some archive footage again , this time even from some of his previous movies , of which some got never completed . This movie might very well feature the worst editing out of all Ed Wood movie's . Ed Wood was basically also really an horrible actors director . The acting is extremely wooden and the actors obviously at times don't know how to act or move , probably because they themselves had a hard time understanding the script or what Wood wanted from them . Of course the budget was also obviously low again for Mr . Wood . This means that the movie is mostly being shot at location and inside small studios , with cardboard sets and hardly any dressing to it , expect for a desk , a phone and a map of the world . Ed Wood always had a hard time finding financiers for his movies . This movie was perhaps the last straw for him and the reason why he for a while quite film-making after this in , in order to pursuit a writing career , before venturing himself into the world of soft-core porn movie-making . Edward D . Wood Jr's last ' serious ' film-making attempt is consistent with the movies he did prior to this movie . So Mr . Wood ends in style with " The Sinister Urge " .
484609	1416505	60664	3.0	Waste of a great story .	I shall not pretend as if I have seen the 1928 version of this movie ( not yet anyway but I'm certainly planning to ) with Conrad Veidt in the main lead , or the original from 1921 , of which this movie is a remake but it's pretty safe to assume that those movies are better than this version . The movie is absolutely horribly made . The concept and setting are quite good and promising but it is all wasted with the weak storytelling of it all . The story itself , based on the book by Victor Hugo , is quite fascination , almost Shakesperean like . It has some great elements in it but it is all wasted in this movie . All of the potential is ruined but the weak acting , dreadful camera-work ( seriously , don't they know what a focus-puller is ? ) and horrible editing . The story is also told messy and at times you don't even know who exactly are supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys of the movie . It makes the movie very unpleasant and uneasy to watch at times . There are still some good moments in the movie , especially in the middle but overall the movie is a dragging , messy , confusing one that isn't really worth watching . The movie also becomes unnecessary ridicules at times , especially toward the ending of the movie . It truly becomes laughable bad at times and loses all of it's credibility because of those many moments , that are present in the movie . Great story , very bad storytelling and execution of it all .
484525	1416505	954541	3.0	Horrible tasteless movie .	I wonder how much this movie actually has got to do with the 1984 movie " Bachelor Party " , starring Tom Hanks . Is this movie even an official sequel ? This movie is lacking in every department and you're obviously better off not watching it . For a comedy this movie simply isn't good or funny enough . It relies mostly on the character's their stereotypical assessments , rather then the movie actually features some good , original and funny moments . Of course there also is very little story present and the movie nude breast than script pages . You just keep waiting for things to finally start off . There is a main plot line in it somewhere but that one is so terribly unoriginal and gets executed so poorly in the movie that it feels more as if it's something non-existent . I guess there even is a message and moral story in it somewhere but this again is so terribly unoriginal and poorly done in the movie that it simply does not work out . It's basically a typical teenage comedy , with lots of sex jokes and nudity , only without the teenage main characters , which makes the story all the more sad and tasteless . The movie makes some really wrong jokes , that are misplaced for any type of movie . I regret ever watching this .
483844	1416505	331468	3.0	An huge failure .	What was the cast thinking when the read the script ? It puzzles me how many big names ( Dennis Quaid , Sharon Stone , Stephen Dorff , Juliette Lewis , Kristen Stewart , Christopher Plummer ) were in this movie . It makes me wonder if the even read the script ! The story is very standard material , no it's even worse than that . . . The movie starts of really slow and bad , in the first hour there are basically just some characters talking and walking on screen without that there is really something interesting happening . The story is done dozens of time , especially in the last couple of years . It is standard thriller material stuff . There is a family moving into an house , the previous house owner than shows up and of course there is a huge secret he is carrying with him , which also involves the house . Oh the originality is killing me ! It's a very standard thriller formula . What follows are some standard thriller moments , including a standard and predictable ending . This movie also contains one of the worst executed scene's I've seen in years . " The snake's in the house " scene . First of all the family goes totally over the top crazy , I mean they act like they just have seen Oprah Winfrey walking naked through their house ! It's supposed to be a scary and hectic moment but it is almost comedy like because of the editing , camera positions but also thanks to the truly horrible musical score by Mike Figgis ( also the director ) himself . The score is so incredibly simple that it literally could have been composed by an 8 year old . Are there some positive things to say about this movie ? Not many . . . It is of course always great to see some good actors in a movie and this movie surely has some good actors . It's too bad that Stephen Dorff plays such a standard psychopath villain , he has played so many good and better villain roles before . It was weird to see Juliette Lewis , she was looking old and . . . fat ! She always used to be such a skinny and baby face looking girl , was it make-up or has her look really changed that much ? I hereby officially declare this movie as a waste of time .
484016	1416505	129290	3.0	An highly unbelievable and unlikely drama .	Yes , I know this movie is based on the real life of Patch Adams but all the events in the movie feel over-the-top and highly unlikely that they really occurred . Its the reason why the dramatic scene's in the movie simply didn't worked for me . First of all , I couldn't even always sympathize for the main character Patch Adams played by Robin Williams ( sometimes he's a bit over-the-top in some dramatic scene's but overall he gives a very solid performance . ) . I mean seriously , Patch Adams really pushes it at times and simply goes too far in his methods . I even found myself on the side of Dean Walcott ( a very typical Bob Gunton stereotype role ala " The Shawshank Redemption " and " Glory " . ) , at times . It is not a good sign for a drama when you couldn't even always sympathize for the main character . This alone is already a reason for why this drama is a failure . All of the events in the movie felt highly unlikely and unrealistic . No way you can convince me that some dying 70 year old could be entertained by a bunch of balloons . Yes , there really were some ' dramatic ' scene's in the movie that simply made me cringe . Its the kind of drama that is really embarrassing to look at . The drama in the movie is very childish and way too cliché . There even is room for a misplaced , unneeded and highly unbelievable love-story . The music by Marc Shaiman is also a reason why the drama in the movie doesn't work . I mean I'm sure that the score is great to listen to outside of the movie ( I mean after all , it was even nominated for an Oscar . ) but in the movie itself it simply doesn't work . It's such a stereotypical and over-the-top drama score ! Basically it's the same tune over and over again in every of the ' dramatic ' scene's . It was really distracting for me at times . It's funny but in the few scene's that he's in Philip Seymour Hoffman truly absolutely the show . How long before this guy will win his Oscar ? Yes every scene that he was in was a highlight for me . This movie is really a waste of a great cast . Its not the cast their fault that the drama doesn't work , I think its director's Tom Shadyac , who manages to deliver the drama in an highly unlikely and unbelievable manner . He should stick to making comedies , me thinks ! A big failure as a movie and drama in many ways . . .
485067	1416505	52077	3.0	Not the worst but still an horrible Z-movie .	Edward D . Wood Jr . or better known as just Ed Wood really was the worst screenwriter of all time . Just like all of his movie , this one doesn't make sense and is filled with plot holes and visual mistakes , which makes this movie a laughable but fun one . . . So Ed Wood was the worst writer and perhaps director of movie history but does that mean that his movie are also the worst of all time ? I think not , even though his movies are far from masterpieces he still knows to put some passion and love for cinema into it . Unfortunately it's a kind of strange love and passion that perhaps only Ed Wood himself understood . Looking at his movies you realize that the movies were made by a person who was living in his own world with his own ideals and standards , in his mind he thought what he did was great but the general public did not agree with that and all of his movies became an huge failure . Does that make him a bad filmmaker ? More a misunderstood one , misunderstood by the whole world . I think this is also one of the reasons for Wood's cult status which he has gotten after his unfortunate early death , people began to see and understand the passion he made his movies with , when they rediscovered his movies and watched them in a new light . But I shall not try to romanticize it , facts are that Wood's movies are unique but still awful ones and it are these two things combined that makes his movies laughable but yet fun to watch . In a strange way I admire Ed Wood's life and career . . . " Plan 9 From Outer Space " is no different from Wood's other movies , except for one thing ; this one his most known one . But why is it his best known one ? Probably because it is his biggest movie and being officially known by the world as worst director of all time , this movie automatically became regarded as the worst of all time . I don't think worst is the best way to describe this movie , strange would be perhaps better . The story is weird and doesn't make a lot of sense . It mixes science fiction with strange zombie kind of horror . An horrible combination that simply doesn't work . Main problem I had with this movie was that I didn't understood who the main character was . The movie follows way too many characters without ever making clear who the ' hero ' was . I think that originally Bela Lugosi was set to portray the biggest role in the movie but after his death the story had to be rewritten , with as a result an even bigger mess . Lugosi still is in this movie , Wood uses some self made archive footage of his good friend while he is running around in his Dracula cape . The result is a strange mix of archive Lugosi footage and sequences with a body double that looks nothing like Lugosi at all . The movie also uses other archive footage of the American army firing their cannons , it really doesn't blend in with the movie and looks laughable . The acting as always is horrible . I really laughed at Tor Johnson with his horrible accent who had been given way too many lines . Other strange roles are portrayed by Vampira , Criswell , John " Bunny " Breckinridge ( who couldn't seem to keep his eyes of Dudley Manlove's costume ) and other Ed Wood regulars Paul Marco , Duke Moore , Lyle Talbot and Conrad Brooks . Still I think that the movie has some nice moments . At times it knows to build up some good tension and I think that the underlying message itself also isn't that bad or unimportant . It's just that it's brought in the wrong way just like in Wood's other movie " Glen or Glenda " was the case .
485335	1416505	1073498	3.0	Well , in all honesty it was better than any other Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer directed movie I've seen so far .	Yes , amazingly enough I have to conclude that this was the best Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer directed movie I've seen in my entire life . It doesn't mean that this movie is exactly brilliant though . It's incredibly lame , features embarrassingly bad and unfunny moments and is basically a movie purely made to cash in . Simple fact is that as long as these movies are making money , more like them will likely get made and released . And this movies are making big money . Every time a Friedberg / Selzer parody gets released I see it somewhere in the top of the box office lists . I really don't understand this . Don't people by now know who Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are and what type of movies they make ? I'm never telling people to boycott movies or film-making but now I'm simply begging everyone to stop and pay money to see these type of movies , it's the only way we can stop them from being produced . Power to the people ! Yes , I know I'm also still watching these movies , so I probably look guilty as well but at least I'm not paying any money for it to do so . The movie is titled " Meet the Spartans " , so yes it indeed is mostly a spoof of the movie " 300 " and it follows basically the same plot line and type of characters but as you could expect from a Friedberg / Selzer the movie is spoofing tons of other recent successful movies as well , as well as some famous movie and TV celebrities . Like always the movie is bombarding us with this . Joke after joke is being put in the movie , as if they were thinking lets put in as many comical moments as possible and some of them are just bound to hit . I must admit , some jokes do hit and is the reason why I regard this movie as the best one from Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer but unfortunately it's only about 5 % of the jokes and comical moments that do hit and made me laugh . 95 % of the rest of the movie is just an utter waste of time and insulting to anyone's intelligence . No , there is nothing wrong with some silly comedy from time to time but not when it is as embarrassingly bad as is the case with " Meet The Spartans " and every other Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer movie for that matter . But I always have to give this movie credit for one thing ; it's always good and professionally looking . There is still obviously some money and effort put into this movie and it has a good visual look over it . What it also does well is re-playing some of the well known sequences from " 300 " . I'll guess you'll probably hate this movie less if you've seen " 300 " and most of the other movies that are being spoofed within this movie . Also most of the actors do a decent job impersonating the actors from " 300 " . Of course most characters are just totally bad and lame though but I don't think you can blame the actors for this . I think it was also a good choice to give Carmen Electra a much bigger role this time because lets face it , her appearances basically always had been part of the highlights of any other Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer movie . Also quite fun that Kevin Sorbo has a big part in the movie . He is of course best known for playing Hercules in the hit-series and TV movies . So he's perfectly in place in this movie , despite the fact that he already was 50 at the time of this movie . For what it's worth ; it's better than any other Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer movie I've seen before in my life . It doesn't mean this movie is watchable or recommendable though . Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer made lame and bad comedy spoofs in the past and they will also just never become good at it . Please simply boycott their next movies when it will hit the cinema and you'll help to prevent these types of movies from being made and you'll stop unfunny and untalented people such as Friedberg and Seltzer from ever making a movie again . Thank you very much !
484367	1416505	91003	3.0	This movie makes some odd choices .	Basically this movie doesn't have one good idea of its own and that's why it ' borrows ' much from other movies but it doesn't do this very good or effectively . Main problem with this movie is that it picks a strange approach with its story . What could and should had been a cyborg action flick is now an adventure movie through the jungle , without ever becoming a good , tense or exciting one to watch . The movie is basically constantly more of the same , when new characters emerge , who for some reason want to see our main heroes dead . The story picks just such an interesting and uninspired approach . It's main premise still lets the movie sound good but the actual end result is simply a failure . It just isn't the best going movie . The movie makes some strange twists and turns in an attempt to give the movie an adventurous and perhaps even an epic kind of feeling over it . Needless to say they failed miserably . The movie has some silly futuristic gadgets and futuristic images in it , like you could only expect from a silly ' 80s flick . Of course all of its special effects aren't quite top-notch looking yet but I have to admit that for 1986 standards it simply is not too bad . I think this movie its intentions were quite serious but however the end result of course is nothing but a typical ' 80's B-movie and not a very good one either . It's one with a bad cast and crew involved . The music is dreadful and doesn't even sound like it got written for this movie at all . All of the other production values are all also really lacking . Same can be said for the script , that also doesn't really feature the best dialog imaginable . So even though they aren't being helped with a good script or dialog , also the actors themselves are bad and lacking in their skills . Guess they just went along with the cheapest actors available at the moment . Perhaps the movie would had still been better to watch with some more action in it . Instead now all we are having are same lame small attempts at action and also lacks a nice spectacular and memorable finale . The movie lacks 2 or 3 real big action sequences , that could had really spiced up things a little . This movie unfortunately makes a lot of wrong choices .
485524	1416505	389097	3.0	An huge disappointment .	I expected great things from this movie after seeing the trailer but I ended up extremely disappointed by the end result . The major problem is that the movie lacks a story . The story just seems like a lame excuse for a bunch of guys to dress up like WW II soldiers and fight each other . Also the few story elements that are present are extremely flawed , unlikely and unbelievable . Still there is some nice character development for a 15 minute short although not all characters are likeable for the viewer . The costumes ( with the exception of the soldier with the white pants , who I call Pvt . Pants now ) are nice and so are the settings . The acting is fairly good and the dialogues are acceptable and the movie doesn't have that much of an amateur look . The effects however are pretty lame . The talent and the passion for movie making is there , however the execution of it all is simply not good . Better luck next time and try to add some more story the next time please .
484272	1416505	307479	4.0	Mumbling in space .	What a miss from the otherwise successful duo Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney . It takes a slow approach , you know with static shots and all but nevertheless still doesn't feature any real long sequences . Because of this the approach just doesn't really work out for the movie . The movie also doesn't ever really properly build up things . Things just happen as they come along , making it all the more harder to understand or find ever realistic . It's also the reason why the movie is fairly short . It's especially short when considering the movie its source material and when comparing it to the 1972 first version of the movie , that is over an hour longer . I'll bet that the movie is even worse and more confusing to follow when you haven't read the Stanislaw Lem novel , or have seen the 1972 Soviet version of the movie , by Andrei Tarkovsky . Since then you'll probably have simply no idea what this movie is all about . The movie doesn't feature any deeper meanings to it , as if Steven Sodenbergh didn't really understood any of the meanings of the original story . Or perhaps he simply tried to make a simplified and more mainstream version . It just totally misses its mark and fails on basically every level . For a mystery it's just way too confusing and doesn't have the right atmosphere for it , for a drama its not involving enough and for a romantic movie it just isn't credible , mainly because of Natascha McElhone . Of course the movie is still great looking and Steven Soderbergh is of course still a very skilled director , despite really missing the mark with this movie . It's also nice to see the actors at work , despite not being given great material to work with . George Clooney is always great in any movie and in any type of role . Most other roles in the movie though sort of leave a pointless impression , or at least not significant enough for the story , with the exception of the Natascha McElhone character of course but I don't know , she is just an actress who always sort of annoys me . Confusing , non-engaging mess , that misses its mark , despite it's wonderful and powerful source material .
483773	1416505	253040	4.0	Not THAT bad , just very pointless .	This movie could had been an interesting character study and could had given some insight on its subject but real problem with this movie is that it doesn't have any of this in it . It doesn't give any insight - , or solutions to the problem . It's just the portrayal of ' old ' male sex addict and the problems this is creating for his every day normal life and family . Why would you want to watch this ? It's all so totally pointless and meaningless . It also really doesn't help that the main character is some wrinkly 50 + year old male . You'll have a hard time identifying yourself - and sympathize for him . He just seems like a dirty old playboy , who is an a constant hunt for woman and sex . He has all kinds of sexual intercourse's about 3 times a day with different woman and not just only with prostitutes . It also doesn't have a bad visual style , though it all feels a bit forced . But nevertheless it's all better looking than most other direct-to-video productions . Who knows , if the film-makers had been given better material to work with , the movie would had deserved a better faith . The story really gets ridicules at times . There are really some pointless plot-lines that are often more laughable than they were obviously supposed to be . I'm talking about for instance the whole Ordell plot-line . Things get worse once they movie starts heading toward the ending . Also the whole way the story is being told , cutting back and forth between the events that happened and the main character's sessions with his psychiatrist feels a bit cheap and simple . But as far as bad movies are concerned , this just isn't one of them . It's not really any better or worse than any other random straight-to-video flick , with similar concepts . Still seems weird and quite amazing that they managed to cast Nastassja Kinski and Ed Begley Jr . in such a simple small insignificant production as this one is . Guess they were really desperate for work and money .
484759	1416505	478337	4.0	Zidane was a more than great football player , but really not a good documentary subject . At least not for one with an approach such as this one .	Just like every football fan , I have to say that Zinédine Zidane really was one of the best players of this and the last century . I would often watch a France game , purely because of Zidane and I wanted to see him do his magic . Even if the game wasn't very good and the team wasn't playing very well , Zidane would always show something special and amazing . His skill and touch was always amazing . Whenever he had the ball if was something special and you just knew something great could happen at any given moment . He doesn't look and move like a very technical player but he really was one of the most technical midfielder of the last few decades . He had a great and impressive but also very successful career , especially with his national team . Every world cup or European cup he participated in , he was one of the best players of the tournament and he won both the World - and European Cup with his country France . He played an important role in his country victories and eventual win of the tournaments , with his two goals in the 1998 finale against Brazil of course as his most memorable achievement . No way that a dumb head-but against Marco Materazzi in the 110th minute of the 2006 World Cup final against Italy , which also was his last game out of his career , should overshadow this great sportsman's career . But as much as I adore Zidane as a player he really isn't a charismatic person or player to watch . His face doesn't ever show any emotions , which sorts of makes you wonder why the film-makers he was such a good subject for this cinematic movie-making approach . After about 30 minutes you've already had it with watching this movie . Most of the time he doesn't even run , he just walks and stands because obviously he isn't on the ball all of the time . After a while the approach of the movie becomes a real bore to watch . It doesn't show anything of Zidane as a person and it also most certainly doesn't show anything of Zidane's qualities as a football player . Therefor what's the point of this ' documentary ' ? This movie only serves an artistic purpose . Although this also doesn't completely work out due to the subject Zidane . So it's a sort of vicious circle . The approach of the documentary doesn't really work out due to Zidane and Zidane isn't presented in his best or most insightful way due to the approach of the documentary . It doesn't do much credit to the exceptional great player Zidane was . On top of the , the approach from this documentary isn't even original . It was used before by German filmmaker Hellmuth Costard , for his documentary " Fußball wie noch nie " , following Manchester United player George Best in real time , during a complete football match . What was highly annoying to me was that most of the sounds were obviously put at a later stage underneath the movie . Some , if not all , sounds were obviously fabricated and recorded in a studio , even Zidane's own breathing and on pitch talking . Unless you believe he was really wearing a microphone during the match . . . The chanting the running on the grass , the kicking of the ball , all off these sounds sound so completely fabricated . It's like listening to a radio play at times . Some of the trivial facts presented in this movie are really ridicules and don't serve a point at all , also not in the least because they have absolutely nothing to do with the subject of the movie . If you want to see the qualities of a player you don't point several camera's just on his face . He should see a wider picture to get a clear view and understanding of his positioning , his passing , his control , his overview , knowing exactly the positions of your teammates and opponents , knowing when to give the right ball . After all , football is still a team sport , no matter how great as an individual you are . The game they follow him also isn't much special . It's just an average Primera Division game of Zidane's Real Madrid against Villareal , in which Zidane even gets send off with a red card before the end of the match . Also sorts of makes you wonder if the makers regret picking this one game to follow him . Has some artistic value but overall really doesn't do enough credit to Zizou .
485187	1416505	339840	4.0	Didn't work for me .	" Undead " had a good and promising beginning . However , as the movie more and more progressed everything began to drag on and the movie even began to irritate me at points . The story seemed to go nowhere and all of the character were way too shallow to make this movie an interesting or good one . The movie is a real gore-fest though . All the gore makes it obvious that this is a Independent-movie that you're watching . To be honest , the gore was the only element of the movie that I really liked and worked out fine . The make-up effects were fantastic . Plain and simple , the movie was too amateur-like at times for me . Obviously the Spierig brothers still have lots of learning to do about film-making . Not everything in the movie always flows and the storytelling is below par at times , probably also due to the poor and simple editing . Also the special effects were far from convincing . Even worse was the horrible musical score . It's the sort of score , a 12-year old come make these days , on his or hers IMac . It was absolutely horrendous at times and it worked extremely irritating . Also the actors were obviously not the most talented in the business . But it were also the characters that they portrayed who were very lacking . Every character in the movie is extremely shallow and the movie lacked a real good main , likable character . The heroic character of the movie looked very much like Torgo from " ' Manos ' : The Hands of Fate " . Not a great look for a hero , even if it was intentional and on top of that the actor that portrayed him did it way too over-the-top . I'm not to sure how to regard this movie . The movie has a totally serious atmosphere and story most of the times but still it has many comedy-elements in it but yet for a comedy it isn't smart and certainly not witty enough . Because of this , the balance between the comedy-horror - and science-fiction elements ended up being extremely flawed . At times you don't know whether to laugh or be terrified . the movie-makers obviously also couldn't make up their mind if they wanted to create a totally serious movie , or a comical one . It all doesn't always make " Undead " a pleasant and easy movie to watch . Nice try , better luck next time .
484384	1416505	323939	4.0	What a mess .	What a cast . . . and what a waste of it . Seriously , when a movie has Gabriel Byrne , Jamie Foxx , Thandie Newton , Stuart Townsend , Hal Holbrook , Melanie Griffith and Sylvester Stallone in it you would expect some quality . The movie is however one big mess with a unlikely story that can't seem to stop putting twist and turns in it . Yeah , I think that they thought they were really being clever with all of it . The story is not only messy and unlikely , it also isn't exactly terribly original . It uses elements from earlier and much better poker game based movies . But to me it were really the many pointless twist and turns in the movie that did it . It made the story such an unlikely one to watch . On top of that the script remains filled with a lot of holes silly poker game errors and things that just don't make an awful lot of sense . Why would any one above all things want to play against a card player that is known as the best cheater in the game . This is what the movie is about and builds up to but just didn't ever made a lot of sense to me . Despite that the movie has a great cast , it still feels as if most actors were miscast in their roles . I don't know what it is about Stuart Townsend . He is a good actor but in most roles he plays he always feels out of place . Perhaps it are his looks , I don't known . This basically also was the reason why he got replaced in " The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring " . Also Thandie Newton isn't much good and actually quite annoying in her ' strong ' female role . And what was the point of having Melanie Griffith in this ? Oh , I guess I could go on about the movie its casting and could complaining even some more about the way too limited screen time the Jamie Foxx character gets but I guess you get my point by now . Damian Nieman just isn't much of an original writer / director and on top of that he also doesn't handle his own material very well . Scenes often feel disjointed , it tries to put in way too many characters and everything about the movie is shallow and in a way predictable . On top of that the movie features some bad editing at times , which also doesn't help to make this movie look like one seamless whole . The movie was also one major box office bomb and no wonder that Damian Nieman hasn't made a movie ever since . A too big mess to make you enjoy this movie .
485041	1416505	239060	4.0	Pretty bad .	From 2002 on Dutch cinema finally got better again . This movie is still part - and a schoolbook example of the bad period of Dutch cinema . The story is needlessly told in flashback style . All of the ' present ' sequences set in France are completely redundant and add nothing to the story , emotions or power . For some reason European filmmakers often find it necessary to tell the story not chronological . I never understood why , or what the appeal of it is . The story self also isn't exactly the greatest . It isn't always clear were the movie is trying to go to and what it tries to tell . The story of a young unexperienced boy falling in love with a wild young girl , who later turns out to be quite psychotic might sound good enough on paper and even shows some parallels to Paul Verhoeven's " Turks fruit " , to which this movie often was compared to before and at the time of its release . However the end result is far from comparable . The story fails to capture the right emotions , which is also due to the unimaginative performances from the actors . The way the story is told also makes the movie far from always interesting or compelling . I lost interest for this movie at about 40 minutes through the movie . At the time this movie was made , both Antonie Kamerling and Angela Schijf were promising rising stars , with great potential and ambitions but both their careers have pretty much dried up by now . Angela Schijf seems to give her family more attention than her career ( that is not a bad thing of course ) , while Antonie Kamerling tried to start a career in Hollywood . He never got any further than playing some small bit parts in 2 Renny Harlin flops . To be honest I'm not surprised . It's not that he is a bad actor and he certainly has got the right looks but his English just isn't good enough , to put it mildly . Just listen to him speaking English in the beginning of this movie and you'll understand what I mean . They are really not bad actors but for some reason it doesn't show in this movie . It's probably also due to the poor dialog . I still kind of liked Beau van Erven Dorens . He's been criticized a lot but his acting seems very natural . He always keeps the characters close to who he self is . It by no means is one of the worst movies ever made but it's not exactly one I would recommend either . Bad and uninteresting storytelling makes this a bad movie .
485026	1416505	316768	5.0	A totally pointless movie .	It's hard to say what this movie exactly tries to achieve . It awfully tries to be a political correct movie towards ' little people ' and the movie almost becomes documentary like and doesn't even try to hide this . The moral of the movie is too cheesy and overdone . It's painfully obvious that writer Bill Weiner is still a beginning writer . The movie is written awfully simple and has some downward horrible dialog in it . It's a big mystery to me why so many big stars appeared in this movie . Gary Oldman , Matthew McConaughey , Kate Beckinsale and Patricia Arquette are some big names in the business . They are given awful material to work with and the movie felt like a waste of their talent . Especially Gary Oldman seemed out of place . He plays a ' little person ' in this movie and to me he didn't looked very convincing . It was highly obvious to me that Oldman was sitting on his knees the whole movie , which was terribly distracting . Couldn't they had just cast a real ' little person ' for that role ? There are some many great little actors out there . Oldman was also terribly unconvincing as Matthew McConaughey TWIN BROTHER . They look absolutely nothing like each other and on top of that Oldman is also too old to be believable as McConaughey's twin brother . This movie made me realize that Oldman is really getting old now . He also looked old in " Batman Begins " but I though it was due to make-up . This movie however made me realize that Oldman really looks as old as that . But of course this movie is far from the worst ever . The movie is professionally good looking and of course , even though they were given awful material to work with , the famous actors also bring some sparks and life to the movie . The story and moral of the movie are too obvious . It's certainly a watchable movie but I in no case would recommend it to anyone .
485561	1416505	96244	5.0	So many big stars and then such an average movie . . .	This movie has a cast to die for ; Mel Gibson , Michelle Pfeiffer , Kurt Russell , Raul Julia , J . T . Walsh , Arliss Howard . It makes you wonder though why they all ever agreed to appear in this movie . It's a waste of their talents really , since the movie its script doesn't provide the movie with anything interesting or exciting . Instead it more often confuses and bores . I was real disappointed by the movie its script . While ' 80's police movies also aren't exactly know for their great or original stories but this story is even worse than usual . In the end you just stop carrying about anything that is happening in this movie or for any of its characters , since the movie has dragged along for far too long . The movie is lacking a certain depth with its story . In all honesty the movie really didn't started off too bad but its one of those movies that gets worse by the minute . In the end it makes you regret you've ever watched it . It's sad that not even the great cast could put some life into the movie and its story . It's also a rather unknown movie from each of the movie its actors . They still try their very best but no , I can't really say it helps much . Although it of course is certainly true that the presence of actors such as Mel Gibson , Michelle Pfeiffer , Kurt Russell , Raul Julia and J . T . Walsh still uplifts the movie . I mean , with a totally different and unknown cast the movie would had been far worse for sure . What the movie is lacking is some good action . It would at least had made the movie more interesting to watch . And when you have an ' 80's action-star such as Mel Gibson in your movie , why not use that ? Instead now the movie feels like a movie done action-crime-thriller movie style but without any action in it and also without much thriller elements , since the movie is just not exciting or original enough to allow any of these elements to completely work out . The movie also suffers from an horrible ' 80's music curse ; the ' 80's music ! It's so dreadful , hearing constantly some idiot playing his saxophone as loud as he can , with an occasional guitar and drums joining in . It's a score you can normally expected in a bad porn-flick . Oh well , it's not exactly as if this is THE worst movie ever made but it also isn't exactly a movie I would recommend to anyone , despite the presence of some good big names in it .
483831	1416505	133046	5.0	Not enough happening in this movie .	I remember when this movie first trailers came around . It looked like a fun movie but above all also a fast paced one with lots of action and thriller elements . However very little of this can be seen back into this movie . A really wasted opportunity , for it's premise was a good one and a rather interestingly original one as well . Maybe I expected too much , since Kevin Williamson , the man behind the Scream movies was at the helm of this movie . The movie turned out to be not quite good or tense enough for a thriller and too serious and weak for a fun comedy . Therefor I can't help regarding " Teaching Mrs . Tingle " as a failed movie , that misses its target . They could had done so much interesting with this movie its story but basically rarely anything tense or remarkable occurs . Mrs . Tingle spends about three quarters of the movie lying tied on bed . They could have let here character manipulate all of the students in a slick and bitchy way , to set them up against each other . The movie does this but it really doesn't go far enough in this . The movie remains pretty shallow because of this and it lacks some good tension and creativity . Not that it's boring but it isn't terrible interesting either . It's also a waste of Helen Mirren's talent . This is not a role we see her often in . She does provide the movie with some really excellent moments but the script offers her little really interesting to do . Nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either really . Katie Holmes really isn't bad in it and so isn't Barry Watson , who I think they tried to launch as the new Johnny Depp , who also started his career in a movie with a similar style as this one ; " A Nightmare on Elm Street " but he never made it and he already is a forgotten actor . Jeffrey Tambor plays a fun role and so does Molly Ringwald , who's role is obviously referring to her image of queen of high-school movies . The movie could had really used some more pace , action and tension . It now instead is a rather shallow movie in which too little ( interesting ) is happening . It still is a somewhat fun movie to watch and obviously not one to take very serious but it all isn't quite enough to make this movie stand out .
485552	1416505	196229	5.0	More lame than funny really .	I like Ben Stiller but seriously he should stop directing movies . The directing is really the weakest element of the movie and almost kills the fun entirely . Stiller also seems to be seriously obsessed with getting as many pointless close-ups of his wife Christine Taylor as possible . I mean she sure is pretty and all but it just gets distracting and annoying after a while . This is one of those movies that has hits and misses and when it hits , it doesn't hit hard . The humor is kind of lame and too over-the-top to be funny . This humor works for , as for instance Austin Powers but not for Derek Zoolander unfortunately . The movie never really becomes really funny , this is also due to the totally ridicules story . Still the movie makes some good fun of the modeling world at times and the small cameo's by the many famous people also makes this movie still somewhat entertaining to watch . The acting of especially the main characters played by Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson is good and is probably what prevents this movie from a completely unfunny and unwatchable one . All the characters are good and funny but unfortunately the script and directing is awful , so they don't get an awful lot to do in the movie . You are better of watching a different Ben Stiller movie , or an Austin Powers movie if you like silly modern humor .
483823	1416505	67329	5.0	Fairly dull ' 70's romp , made worthwhile by George C . Scott .	This is a fairly dull typical ' 70's movie that tries to be more than it really is . Problem is that there isn't much interesting ever happening in this movie , with also an unnecessary and also far from believable love triangle story in it . Hard to imaging that George C . Scott and Trish Van Devere actually got married one year later , after this movie . The movie movie clearly lacks a good main plot line and gets mostly carried purely by George C . Scott's performance . In this movie George C . Scott once more shows his talent , by giving away one fine performance . But no matter how good he is in his role , he still feels miscast . Even though Scott was ' only ' 44 at the time , he already looked far too old for his role , to consider him really believable . George C . Scott just wasn't an actor who aged really well . When he was 40 he already looked like he was 60 years old . The rest of the cast consists out of insignificant actors , who show why they never broke through as actors . At times the movie still is a typical ' 70's movie , with a good atmosphere and way of storytelling . Yet the movie doesn't always feel coherent , since its good at some times and completely dull and uninteresting to follow at others . It perhaps has to do with the fact that famed director John Huston walked from the movie after having heated arguments with George C . Scott over some script changes . Only a typical ' 70's car chase is good enough to grab your attention for a short while but the movie swiftly becomes less exciting and more dull after that again . The movie really could had used some more action and at least more speed at times . The movie tries hard to be in the same style as some old classic ' 40's but neither the script nor characters allow this movie to ever get close . The movie should had sticked more to its own style and time period . Really only worth watching because of George C . Scott .
483822	1416505	59905	5.0	Unsuccesful and above all unsatisfying genre attempt .	Director Val Guest got his fame for directing horror / science-fiction movies in the ' 50's . His movies never have really been the greatest but they were decent enough genre pieces , that are also quite well known , all over the world . With comedies he just never received much fame or praise and for a good reason , also especially when you look at this film . Though the right intentions are definitely there , this just isn't a good enough genre movie . The movie is obviously trying to be a light entertaining espionage movie , perhaps even a genre spoof - and cold war spoof at times . The movie as a whole just isn't light enough in its settings and events to consider this really an entertaining movie , that doesn't successfully parodies or even entertains enough . The movie works in parts as a comedy and entertainment , especially in the beginning but its many more weaker moments really downgrade the movie and in parts even makes it a totally unwatchable and bad one . The movie has a main plot line but it almost seemed as if they simply shot the movie as it was on the call-sheets , without paying much attention to development . Because of that the movie also becomes mostly uninteresting to watch and the events in the movie almost impossible to follow or care for . The movie its main problem is really how poorly developed it is . Also with its seemingly important characters in the movie , that come and go and never get properly introduced or developed . The movie has further more a great cast , filled with mostly some of the best British actors from its period . It are the sort of actors you perhaps not know by name but definitely by face . Of course David Niven is well known and he carries the movie well with his role and he also proofs how well he can handle the comedy genre but no matter how great he is , he feels out of place nevertheless , mostly due to his age . He just doesn't seem believable enough as a spy who gets the girls and charms his way through things . The movie is shot at some nice far off locations but still the movie feels very low-budget . This is also due to some incredibly lame and fake looking miniature effects . Pay especially attention toward the ending when a character is jumping from a riding plane . Not a complete train-wreck but not exactly a movie worth searching out either .
483962	1416505	67479	5.0	It was fun !	Difference with other Ed Wood movies is that Eddy didn't took this project very serious . He puts in some jokes and some of the dialog even manages to be funny at times . A big accomplishment for the worst screen writer of movie history . The acting was really laughable and the story makes absolutely no sense . " Necromania " mixes porn with horror and the end result actually is pretty fun to watch . Most certainly not Wood his worst . The music really is something that made me laugh . It sounds like it was directly taken from an old Wood movie from the 50's and was just plain odd to listen to , especially with the images with it . It's a typical 70 porn movie meaning that it features lot's of hair and sideburns . Judging by all the other comments here , most people have seen the R-rated version , I've actually seen the X-rated version but seriously the X-rated version also isn't exactly something that will make you warm . The movie is just more fun than anything to watch and absolutely most certainly not Wood's worst .
484288	1416505	252963	5.0	Watchable but I can't think of any reason why you should watch this movie .	This movie really had the potential in it to become one of my favorite movies ; Horror and Nazi's . I always found this combination to be an intriguing one and I in general always enjoy and admire movies that try to combine several different elements such as different genre combinations and time period combinations . Plus I like watching movies with Nazi's in it ( OK that sounded just wrong ) because they're basically the ultimate movie villains . The movie is from a period when the WW II genre was hot and popular again . A period that was launched by the success and critical acclaim of Steven Spielberg's " Saving Private Ryan " . This movie is just like any other genre movie that tried to gain some money after that success . The movie lacks in basically everything ; tension , mystery , character development , plot . On top of that the movie is obviously also made with a low-budget , which really shows on screen . The concept of the movie sounds good enough for a scary , tense and atmospheric horror movie . The movie is perhaps more atmospheric than anything else but this just isn't enough in this case , since the movie builds up and builds up to basically nothing . Nothing extraordinary , tense or even mysterious ever really occurs in this movie , which is of course a huge miss and rather weird and disappointing to watch . The movie has some good actors in it but none really shine in this movie . The characters remain too flat for that and the movie has too many characters in it and lacks a good - and likable main character . And yes it's definitely a bit weird to see some ' British-as-they-can-get ' actors play a couple of Nazi's . As a matter of fact is there any reason that the characters in this movie are Nazi's , rather than British or American soldiers ? As the movie progresses it becomes obvious why ; they did it because the characters in the movie are far from good guys , as strongly becomes obvious at the end and with the help of some flashbacks . Having Americans , British or any other allied group as the main characters would had been far too sensitive and would had aroused far more criticism and controversy . It's definitely not an unwatchable movie but I just can't think of any reason why anyone should ever watch this movie .
484800	1416505	118636	6.0	Great concept but weak story .	The concept of the movie is great and original , however the story is weak and gets later on in the movie unbelievable when all logic gets abandoned . The movie start of quite well and promises to get very interesting and has some nice thriller elements , however halve way through the story takes a turn and all the feeling of tension between the two main characters ( young boy Renfro and old Nazi McKellen ) is suddenly gone because the story gets unbelievable and because of that also uninteresting to watch . Still the chemistry between the two characters is good and for that alone the movie is worth watching . Ian McKellen is surprising good as rotten old Nazi war criminal that fled to America after WW II and Renfro also once again proofs that he is a young talented actor . Decent movie that could have been great but still has some nice thriller elements in it and some well done scene's which makes the movie watchable but not recommendable .
483877	1416505	118607	6.0	Visually great but nothing more then that .	Visually the movie looks brilliant , the costumes , the sets , the cinematography , everything is perfect . However the story is at some point over dramatic and follows way too many characters in way too many long and sometimes pointless scene's . The cast is amazing it has so many great actors in it that I don't know where to start and they all give the performances of their lives . I especially mention Anthony Hopkins and Morgan Freeman . Then were did it go wrong with such a great cast & crew ? The story . The story itself is actually pretty weak . I'll admit that at first the movie seems wonderfully made with excellent dialogs and visually amazing scene's . However when you think about it ; how many of those scene's and characters are actually really needed ? For instance , what's the point of Morgan Freeman's character ? And what's the point of those long scene's were they do nothing but talking that hasn't really got to do anything with the main story . Yes sure the scene's are done wonderful and although they are long they aren't boring at all but just think about it ; are they really needed ? It almost seems as if those beautiful scene's and the acting are a cover up for the weak story . It would have been a better movie if it had been 30 minutes shorter and had lesser characters in it . Still the movie is very watchable . There are a few memorable scene's and like I said many times before ; visually the movie is wonderful ! I still find the movie recommendable , also because of the importance of it .
484672	1416505	26362	6.0	Too much talking going on on screen for a Laurel & Hardy comedy short .	This movie has one main problem ; It has too much talking and too little comedy situations . It makes " The Fixer Uppers " one of the lesser Laurel & Hardy comedy shorts . Yes , it's definitely true that the movie gets better toward the ending but that was all too late for me . Basically the movie relies too much on just one comical situation and builds the entire movie around this . The comical situation itself isn't even original and the boys used it before in one of their first silent movies together ; " Slipping Wives " . The entire first halve of the movie is too boring and too little is happening , mainly because there is way too much dialog in it . Of course the movie still has some well executed moments and it surely made me laugh at at least two occasions . It proofs that even the lesser Laurel & Hardy movies are still good enough to give you an overall good time and make you laugh , or at the very least amuse you . Laurel & Hardy regular Mae Busch shows up in a quite big and significant role this time . She shows that she was a great comedy actress and entertains in her role . Another Laurel & Hardy regular in this movie is Arthur Housman , who yet again plays a drunk . It's a less significant and a too forced role unfortunately to provide the movie with some good memorable moments . Weak first halve , too much talking and it relies too much on one comical situation . All the reasons why this movie is one of the lesser Laurel & Hardy comedy shorts that of course still entertains and amuses , especially its fans .
484684	1416505	264616	6.0	A decent movie but hardly worthy of its good reputation on here .	This is a decent movie at its very best . It's very well watchable but as a genre movie its too lacking in its story and execution of it . With all of its praising this movie is receiving on here , it surely is a bit of an overrated movie . Problem for me while watching this movie was that I knew that this was simply the type of movie in which nothing is what it seems , which made me all the more aware all of the time , making me see lots of the twists within this movie from miles away already . The movie was just being a bit too obvious with its intentions and what directions it was heading toward . The movie therefore wasn't really being very surprising , despite having more than a few twists to its story . Also a bit too many perhaps . It's best to have one big twist at the ending than to have multiple twists throughout its entire story . It's just less effective and powerful . Guess its a good enough first theatrical directorial movie debut for Bill Paxton , who doesn't provide the movie with a good style or distinctive atmosphere but nevertheless sets the right mood and knows to tell the story , despite the story not being all that great . The movie never made it to most cinemas though and its not hard to see way . The movie is too typical for its genre and it doesn't stand out in any way . Movies like this get made by the dozens each year , especially during those days and there simply are far better and more surprising genre movies to watch out there . For his first big movie Bill Paxton knew to get some big names involved . It makes you wonder though if they would had also agreed to this project hadn't Paxton been involved in it . Matthew McConaughey and Powers Boothe are some big name actors but also the crew has some big names in it , such as the director of photography Bill Butler . It's also hard to see what the movie and its story try to achieve really . Are we supposed to be sympathetic at the end and which side are we supposed to be on ? The movie perhaps in the long run leaves more questions than answers really , which makes the movie a bit of an unsatisfying one . No , it's no bad movie but it's also far from a must-see as well really .
485121	1416505	312549	6.0	Weak attempt by Bruckheimer to try and win an Oscar .	After making big successful action blockbusters such as " Con Air " , " Armageddon " and " The Rock " , it was obvious that producer Jerry Bruckheimer tried to go for an Oscar with this little dramatic movie . A weak attempt . The movie could have been good but it doesn't get any better as average . Who's to blame ? Probably the director Joel Schumacher , he delivers a shallow drama without any emotions . Or maybe it's because of the main character . The character of Veronica Guerin never really becomes interesting or completely understandable with as a result that the viewer doesn't really get emotionally involved . Director Schumacher tries to make Veronica's character a warm loving mother and wife but fails completely in this and all the families scene's feel more like an obligation . Another crucial mistake is that in all the advertisements and also in the beginning of the movie it was told that Veronica Guerin was murdered . Now I'm sure that this is common knowledge in Ireland but I can assure you that it isn't in the rest of Europe and especially not outside of it . In a way it already ruined the movie for me . I know that this movie isn't made for entertainment but to tell Veronica's story instead but surely they could have made it more interesting for the viewer to watch by not telling how it would end . I know that Cate Blanchett was much praised for her role but quite frankly I didn't liked her all that much . But Maybe the reason for that had more to do with Veronica's character and not so much with Cate Blanchett's acting skills . But all in all this movie is not a punishment to watch but like I said before it simply doesn't get any better as average .
484942	1416505	87635	6.0	Unusual Steve Martin comedy that just doesn't fully work out .	The movie doesn't really have the usual typical sort of comedy you would expect from an ' 80's Steve Martin movie . It's humor is often more in its little things , or one word that is spoken in its dialog . The movie doesn't build up to its jokes like a normal comedy would do but often things just come out of nowhere . It doesn't make this movie as humor filled as you would perhaps expect but it does make the movie somewhat original and somehow also real pleasant . Too bad that the story is such a weak one . The story doesn't seem to have one clear focus and subplots are not handled well enough . This has as a result that some moments and even characters just don't work out properly for the movie . It makes the movie also really a weak one to watch at times . The love-story just was too weak and not well developed enough . Judith Ivey is also supposed to be in her mid-20's in this movie but instead looks closer to 40 , while Steve Martin also works around a bit too much without his shirt on . It are mainly small things such as these that also makes the movie irritating at parts as well as weak , simply since it doesn't work out all as well as obviously intended . This movie could had been a great homage to the lonely guy but instead its story is all over the place , jumping from the one thing to another . It doesn't really give a good or fair portrayal of the average lonely guy , who normally is shy and just not the way Steve Martin portrays it in this movie . Charles Grodin is perhaps way better but he's just only playing second violin in this movie . Still a pleasant enough little movie to watch but just no genre classic , since it has way too many weaknesses , mainly concerning its story .
483838	1416505	348150	6.0	Choses to be sentimental instead of entertaining .	OK Superman is back ( and I'm glad he is ) ! But not with a blast . It's a recent trend in superhero movies to give the story and its character a deeper meaning and more realistic emotions . Most recent example of this is of course " Batman Begins " and other examples are " Spider-Man " and " Hulk " . " Superman Returns " also tries to put this in the movie . It however does not suit the main character and is not true to the spirit and atmosphere of the other original previous Superman movies . The movie takes itself far too serious with as a result that it isn't always a fun or entertaining one to watch . It tries to be more than just another superhero movie but it never knows to fully convince . The movie in the beginning takes it time to explain the story for the viewers who haven't seen the ' 78 original and its sequel , on which this movie is a direct sequel again . I can't say that I think this was the right choice . The movie would had been better of if the action , so to speak , started off immediately and didn't wasted any time on re-introducing all of the characters . The movie does however still show lots of respect to the original , mainly with its use of music . The opening credits are done in the exact same style as the original and they also didn't changed a not with its music , which really was the right thing to do . Let's be honest , the opening credits of the original ' 78 " Superman " movie are perhaps the most spectacular and most awesome opening credits of all time , which is mainly thanks to the John Williams music . Director Bryan Singer and John Ottman also seemed to realize and understand this and they use the John Williams at the exact right moments in the movie . John Ottman , on his turn , also composed a wonderful and suiting musical score on his own , complete with a wonderful new Superman theme . The movie feels like two separate stories . One story concentrates on Superman / Clark Kent and the other on his eternal villain Lex Luthor , who is out of prison again , due to the absence of Superman during his court hearing . The movie doesn't feel as a complete whole and it is not until when the two stories mix that the movie starts to take pace and become truly interesting to watch . This however happens too late into the movie to completely save it . The story itself is also very simple , a bit too simple for my taste . It also lacks some of the fundamental things a Superman movie needs . Superman movie needs to be fun , colorful and perhaps even a bit campy . Bryan Singer's Superman world is mostly dark . Also the humor is wrong . The movie does have humor in it but not the right kind . Superman movies needs slapstick , over-the-top sort of humor . The humor and atmosphere in this movie really doesn't suit the Superman character . It makes you wonder ; Perhaps isn't the Superman character a bit too old fashioned for the 21th century ? The movie concentrates too much on the dramatic and realistic aspects of the movie , such as the whole love triangle and problems between Superman , Lois Lane and her fiancée played by James Marsden , which is far from interesting or compelling . The movie still could had a great one , despite its plot , if it had been a more entertaining one . The movie is lacking in some real good action . Basically the biggest and most spectacular action sequence of the movie is already in the beginning ( the plane sequence ) . After that the movie and its action slows down and the end of the movie could had really used a big and spectacular finale . Instead now the movie doesn't know how and when to end . The ending is overlong , over-dramatic and completely unnecessary . They could had basically summed things up in 5 minutes but the movie chooses an overlong sentimental ending instead . Brandon Routh is perfectly cast as Superman and he also really looks like Christopher Reeve . As expected Kevin Spacey steals the show as Lex Luthor but his presence is perhaps not as spectacular or as memorable as Gene Hackman's . Kate Bosworth is really miscast as Lois Lane . Lois Lane should be a strong , independent woman with lots of life experience . With all respect but Kate Bosworth looks like a fragile teenager . Visually the movie is great and spectacular . All of the special effects are top-class ( Oscar nod , no doubt ) and they provide the movie with its best moments . I'm glad Superman is back on the silver screen but the the movie itself is nothing too remarkable . In the end it's a pretty forgettable , overlong movie , that is too simple , even while it tries to be so much more than just a superhero movie . I don't mean to sound cruel but you're better of waiting for the DVD . It's not really a movie worth seeing in cinemas .
484256	1416505	249667	6.0	It takes longer to read this review than it takes to watch " Kung Fu Kenobi " .	" Kung Fu Kenobi " is an interesting test movie , it can be seen as the test movie for Evan Mather's later ' Star Wars action figures ' movies . In 1999 Evan Mather made another Kung Fu Kenobi adventure called " Kung Fu Kenobi's Big Adventure " , it's pretty much in the same style as this movie and both have a fun and fitting soundtrack . It's a kind of weird movie but fun at the same time . I especially like the slow-motion scene . A fun and greatly made animation movie . It takes longer to read this review than it takes to watch " Kung Fu Kenobi " so go and watch it now !
484515	1416505	774095	6.0	A compilation of the TV series , rather than an actual movie .	I have only seen a couple of episodes of " The Dudesons " in my lifetime but it seems as if I had seen the best of them , since 90 % of what I had seen is also in this movie . This ' movie ' is merely a compilation of the televisions series episodes . This obviously was a bit of a disappointment and it also doesn't really make this a ' movie ' at all . But OK , it's a compilation of their best moment and its uncensored so obviously there is plenty to enjoy . Apparently the dudesons already shot some of their stuff before " Jackass " aired , so simply calling this just another " Jacksass " rip-off wouldn't be fair , even though the first " Jackass " episode aired in 2000 and the first " Extreme duudsonit " ( " The Dudesons " ) episode aired in 2001 . It's also original in its own way , since it has created a style of its own and the Finnish environment is of course also different and something that makes the series and movie also special . What also makes it special is that the guys are living together on their ranch , just outside their home town . They perform a lot of their crazy stuff in and around their ranch . This makes it all the movie fun and gives the whole series and movie a more good and fun brotherhood like feeling as well . One thing I don't like about the dudesons is their laughing . No matter what they do , they always think its very funny . It's as if they in advance decided in their own minds they are going to laugh , no matter what happens , with as a result that they are always laughing like maniacs , even if it isn't that funny what they are doing . Another thing I don't really like is how irresponsible they are . They don't think , they just do things without taking any precautions . You can call it spontaneous and call it one of the strong points of the dudesons but sometimes its just to stupid what they are doing . For instance , they are putting things and each other on fire without making sure there is water around , just in case , which is also the reason why their ranch basically burned down . But also the stunts themselves seem to have been hardly thought out . Sometimes it just plain dangerous what they are doing , which is also the reason why all of them have broken a lot of bones already and some of them have permanent damage on their young age already . I seriously wouldn't at all be surprised to hear one day one of the dudesons died or becomes an permanent invalid , during one of their stunts and antics . Some of their bone braking stuff can be seen back in this movie , as well as the almost complete burning down of their ranch . Best parts however of course still remains the stuff with Mr . Hitler . One of the best things about the dudesons is how fast going it always is . Normally the episode are also around 20 minutes short , rather than half an hour , which is a more standard time . It's always well edited and cool looking . But still thing is , I still have difficulties with knowing who is who exactly in the series and movies . Some of them look alike and change their appearances often and their odd Finnish names aren't that easy to remember as well . I'm still learning though . It's fun and enjoyable but if you're a follower of the series , there is basically no point in ever watching this movie , since it's a mere compilation of episodes , without any new stuff added to it , except the fact that it's uncensored , which means there is some nudity . ( Still , funny enough the male nudity is still being censored though . )
485154	1416505	20641	6.0	Greta Garbo is in top form in this hard to watch and somewhat disjointed movie .	This is Garbo's first ever talking role but she acts as if she has done nothing else before . What makes the movie however hard and also sort of unpleasant to watch is it's storytelling . The movie is set up like a stage-play , so most of the time the characters just sit around and talk . All we see in the first 30 minutes for instance are characters being drunk and complaining a lot about life . The movie is of course also based on a stage-play , so no great wonder that the storytelling in this movie also feels like one . But if I want to watch something like this I would to to the theater . There are of course some good stage-play to movies translations but I guess that back in 1930 they didn't had a real good idea yet or the experience to translate a stage-play well to the silver-screen . The movie is now instead a sort of a bore in parts , since its obviously dragging at moments . The movie is also of course very limited in its settings and the movie often jumps from the one setting to the other , as if the curtain had dropped and a new set had been build-up during the break . The movie just never really feels as one big whole and it instead feels as if it consists out of different acts . It's a very static movie . It's not just only a hard movie to follow because of its storytelling and settings but also because of all of the heavy accents of the actors . On top of that , the sound recording quality of course wasn't that good yet back in 1930 so not everything that is being said is understandable . Also the picture quality of the movie isn't that good anymore . Time hasn't been kind on it . The image is sort of fuzzy in parts and the movie is perhaps more gray than truly black & white . It is definitely true that the movie gets better and better when it heads toward its ending but it didn't made me forget it's way weaker first 30 minutes and disjointed storytelling in the movie overall .
484696	1416505	71233	6.0	Udo Kier shines as a sensual and dramatic Count Dracula .	Even though this movie is far from the best Dracula movie and it doesn't live long on in memory , it still is a perfectly watchable movie to watch . Main and perhaps only reason why this movie is perfectly good to watch , is the portrayal of Udo Kier as Count Dracula . He doesn't portray Dracula really as a scary character but more as a tragic and vulnerable villain . I like his approach of the classic character . Also both his accent and looks are just simply perfect for the role . The story however is a bit dragging and doesn't really seem to go anywhere . The characters also aren't really much good and I couldn't tell the 3 daughters apart because they looked too much like each other ! Oh and Joe Dallessandro is an horrible actor , amazing thing that he managed to play parts in movies ever since . Funny thing is that Arno Juerging once again plays Udo Kier's servant , the same sort of role he played in " Flesh for Frankenstein " . The movie is not really scary or gory , except for ending , what a gruesome death for Dracula that was ! Yes it's watchable but not a must see Dracula movie by any means , not even for the fans .
485440	1416505	374018	6.0	Some good film-making , too bad about the main story .	No doubt Paddy Breathnach watched some Guy Ritchie . The style and storytelling is obviously the same . I don't mind this , since it's an excellent and above all very entertaining style of film-making . Obviously it's not as good as a Guy Ritchie movie of the same style but it's surely entertaining enough . It's not as good since the comedy in the movie feels more forced and planned out , rather than that it's cleverly and subtle written throughout the story . The events happen as comical moments rather than just moments that happen to the main characters . But of course you should perhaps not compare this too much to a Guy Ritchie and more regard it as a movie on its own . After all , it's Irish and therefor has a totally different atmosphere and lingo as well . In that regard this movie is just simply a well made and definitely entertaining one . But was dog racing the best backdrop and choice for the main story ? I don't think so . Some sports are not really sports in my opinion and therefor couldn't care any less about the movie its plot . I also couldn't care too much for the movie it's main characters . The actors portraying them are obviously not amongst the most talented , though they do a fair enough job playing average , regular ' normal ' persons . So it's definitely a movie with some pluses and minuses . The style and fun in this movie is definitely good and makes this an enjoyable watch . I only wished the movie had picked another main-plot , to also make the movie more compelling and interesting and perhaps even a bit more exciting to watch . After all , with these kinds of movies involving ' sports ' featuring an underdog , you already exactly know in advance how it's going to end . A pleasant watch but unfortunately no more than that .
484878	1416505	284837	6.0	Quite bad actually , if it weren't for the Ali G character .	This is actually a quite lame comedy with some extremely childish humor but it all still somewhat works out due to the presence of the legendary Ali G character in it all . Even though this movie has basically nothing to do with the " Da Ali G Show " the character still works out as well in this movie . It's of course a ridicules and outrageous character but he's all the more hilarious because of it . It's obviously a satire on the whole rap and hip hop scene and it's still Sacha Baron Cohen most legendary character , despite the successes he has had with Borat and Brüno . The movie has some very childish humor , which mostly is about sex and it has an almost non-existent story . It's just the kind of movie in which the story really doesn't matter . It's all purely about the main character . Even the lamest and most predictable movie in this movie will still surely make you laugh a couple of times . " Ali G Indahouse " is not the most hilarious movie ever made or the best thing Sacha Baron Cohen has done in his life but it's good enough for a couple of dumb silly laughs . Still the movie gives you the feeling it has more misses than hits in it but jokes are bombarded at you so fast that you just tend to sort of forget the movie its weaker moments and enjoy the movie its more funny moments . Quite amazing actually that respected actors such as Michael Gambon and Charles Dance appeared in this type of movie . Or perhaps they knew of Ali G's success and just wanted to be a part of it . Still I feel that when looking back at it they won't regard this as their finest moment . Good enough for a couple of dumb laughs .
484661	1416505	381125	6.0	About as good as a 2 minutes short can get .	When you are going to watch a 2 minutes short animated film you know it is not going to be a masterpiece unless it has a good joke at the end . Unfortunately " Date Double " doesn't has this . It sounds weird for a 2 minute short but the movie is a bit too long . After about 30 seconds you have already seen it and you are waiting for it to end . It is good for a few laughs but it is just not something I rave about and tell my friends to have a quick look at it on the Internet . The quality is good although the voice recording is not top class . You can hear that none of the voice actors where in the same room at the time of recording . They say their line's without really acting to anyone , at least it sounds that way . Not a bad short film but no must see or anything .
485584	1416505	48528	6.0	A late swashbuckler that forgot to be entertaining .	It isn't until the end that the movie turns into a spectacular and true swashbuckler . In between there are too many long moments in which basically nothing is happening . Also often the action just seems to drop out of nowhere and the movie features some awkward and forced humor , that perhaps even is a bit embarrassing to watch . But hey , everyone knows that the greatest swashbucklers were not made in the ' 50's . The story is just a great one . It's an absolutely top-class and solidly constructed story . It had lots of potential in it and interesting characters and motivations . The movie however never really fully uses all this potential You can't help when looking at this movie thinking how much better it all could had been , or at least more entertaining , if it just went that one step further . The movie gets obviously restrained by its low budget but that's no excuses in my opinion . The directing is rather bland and imaging-less . Strange though , since Richard Thorpe is obviously a capable director . The love-story feels forced , as if it was simply a needed ingredient . It of course always has been a part of the swashbuckler genre but in this particular case they would had been better off skipping it , since it's simply not believable in the story and there is no chemistry between the two lovers , played by Robert Taylor and Kay Kendall . The end still makes up a lot for the movie , when the main hero and villain are clashing their weapons , while swinging in a bell tower . Great swashbuckling stuff . The movie has some great characters in it but non of them quite work out , since they are being portrayed too formulaic . You know this is the sort of movie in which the villains all wear black and the good guys are all colorful and stuff . A shame , since it again , showed some real good potential . Robert Taylor did a good job , although he really ain't no Errol Flynn . He also was perhaps a little bit too old for his role already . He was 44 at the time and he really looked like it . It's also not hard to see why Kay Kendall nothing really had a sparkling career , though her early dead in 1959 also of course contributed to this . Not a that bad movie but the Sir Walter Scott novel deserved a better treatment .
484385	1416505	28683	6.0	Perhaps Garbo's finest performance .	Basically Garbo is still the only reason why I still like this very heavy handed melodramatic movie . " Camille " is a movie about the all old themes love and death . The one moment it's happy and the world is a wonderful place , while the other life is depression is it ever could become . It's an movie with constantly changing dramatic moods and tones in the movie , which just becomes a bit too much for me after a while . I can handle and appreciate heavy dramas but when it's being overly melodramatic it becomes more of an annoyance to me , also since it starts making more and more a staged impression . It's a fine looking movie with its sets and costumes and George Cukor of course is more than a capable director . So basically it's a very well made movie but it's story and the way it progressed made me not really like this movie . I guess it's a good story on its own right though , also since there are a total of 47 movie versions based on the novel and play " La dame aux camélias " by Alexandre Dumas fils , which is more than any other novel I have ever heard of . It might very well be true that this movie features Greta Garbo's finest performance . It was also her personal personal favorite one . She plays her role with both class and emotion and above all keeps her role real and humane . The best and most powerful and classic moments of the movie all feature her . Her acting still makes this movie worthwhile and an interestingly watchable one . Watch it for Garbo .
483846	1416505	180093	7.0	Not emotional , not shocking . . . not a masterpiece !	This movie promised to be a lot but overall it only disappointed me . This movie promised to be emotional , shocking , confronting , nightmare giving . . . the greatest anti-drugs movie ever made ! It wasn't any of it . There are several problems I had with this movie . The first and biggest was the style . Now , I love Tim Burton movies and I'm a Brian De Palma fan , so normally I like unusual and unique styles , however the visual style of " Requiem for a Dream " just didn't do it for me . In my opinion it also didn't do any good to the movie and the story . It made some of the emotional scene's even almost look comical like . I know the style was meant to give the movie a ' trippy ' kind of feeling but if you truly want to have a ' trippy ' movie experience watch " Natural Born Killers " instead . I don't know but the movie also gave me the feeling that the cast and crew didn't really did much if any research on drugs and the effects . They could have had at least spoke to some ( ex ) - junkies or spend 10 minutes in a room with Courtney Love or sit down all together in an Amsterdam coffeeshop for a day . I don't really know why but the movie didn't gave me the feeling at all that they did any of this . Maybe if they had done this they also wouldn't have had miss cast Jennifer Connelly . I like her as an actress but she is far to pretty and ' normal ' like to play a convincing drugs addict . The story was also quite standard and pretty far fetched . I mean , if you're a drugs user this is about the extreme that could happen ( but not the worst ) . I Only really liked the Ellen Burstyn story line . Mainly because Ellen Burstyn self acts wonderful and her character is the only one that doesn't start as an addict and is the most believable and emotionally involving one . That brings me to another I had with the movie . I couldn't feel for the characters . I make it sound like this is an horrible movie which I totally hate . But however this is not the case . There are enough positive things to say about this movie . Such as the hectic ending , that really made up a lot for me and nice little musical score by Clint Mansell was also good . I still have respect for this movie and what it tries to be but for me it overall left simply just a disappointing impression . A bad movie ? No ! Over-hyped ? Yes !
484940	1416505	69902	7.0	Not the fastest or most clever Columbo movie but its writing makes this a solid one .	It's not the best Columbo movie out of the series but it's just as good and perfectly watchable as most other Columbo series from the long running series of fine movies . The movie features some very long sequences , of which some are really too long . Some sequences just go on and on without getting swiftly to its point , while it easily could . Also not all of the sequences seem to be relevant for the actual movie and its main plot . The movie is also one of the longest Columbo movies made , with its 98 minutes . It doesn't make this the fastest or best flowing Columbo movie but its story still keeps the movie interesting throughout . It also isn't the most clever Columbo movie in terms of the killer his plot and it isn't a Columbo movie with many twists to the story but it simply is a well written solid story that remains interesting throughout its characters and settings . Having a candidate for senator as the movie its killer works out fine . It provides the movie with some tense sequences between the killer and Lt . Columbo , since Columbo is obviously somewhat reluctant at first of making accusations against such an highly respected man , that also above all things is his wives favorite candidate . And of course the senatorial candidate is underestimating the lieutenant . The movie also features all of the other usual Columbo movie ingredients , including some good relieving humor . Perhaps a tad bit more humor than the usual Columbo movie but it's welcome . The movie is also made great to watch thanks to its fine performances . Peter Falk is great in his role and he fits the part like a glove . Can you just imaging any other actor portraying the iconic figure ? In this movie he is playing opposite Jackie Cooper , who is best known to the main public as Perry White from the Superman movies starring Christopher Reeve . He is really great and charismatic in his part and a worthy ' important ' opponent for the lieutenant . Simply another fine Columbo movie entry , of the usual high standards .
485302	1416505	454841	7.0	Some nice effective modern horror .	I'm not against remakes in general , since sometimes modern movies can give ' older ' movies something extra with a makeover with todays technology and standards . Doesn't mean that I just agree with all remakes , since some of them are just plain pointless since the original ones are already brilliant at their own right . However this is just a remake that I don't mind . To be honest I haven't seen the 1977 Wes Craven original but I'll bet that it was quite different from this movie . This movie is a typical modern horror movie , with a modern atmosphere and style written all over it . I wouldn't at all be surprised if this movie actually turned out to be better than its original . The movie features purely unknown actors , with the exception of Ted Levine perhaps and Kathleen Quinlan also has had her 15 minutes of fame . The fact that this movie purely mostly features unknown actors in it ensures that you just never know in advance who is going to die next . This of course has a successful effect on the tension and therefor the movie overall . Yes , " The Hills Have Eyes " is mostly a formulaic genre movie and also story-wise this movie really ain't anything special ( basicly the movie is about the one killing after the other ) but its simply such a fine made one that you tend to sort of forgive the movie for all of its imperfections . For the genre movie lover this is just one great to watch movie , that features all of the ingredients you would expect from it . Some good scare moments , some fine make-up effects and plenty of good old gore . It's a quality made movie , with a fine crew behind it . Director Alexandre Aja previously had directed the French stylish horror hit " Haute tension " and was probably the reason why he got picked to directed this movie . There are definitely worse genre movies to watch out there , especially when it comes down to remakes .
485028	1416505	109444	7.0	Standard but well made movie .	This is a good and above average political thriller with action elements in it . Still the movie gets a bit too complicated at times and isn't always easy to follow . The movie is also long and some point of the movie are dragging on , even though the pace always remains good and high . It's hard to say in which genre this movie can be put . For an action movie it doesn't have enough action and for a thriller the story isn't good enough . It makes " Clear and Present Danger " a bit of a mixed movie that is far from perfect but still remains a perfectly watchable movie with some great actors and some memorable moments . Main problem I had with the movie is that it lacked a distinctive visual style . A problem all Phillip Noyce movies always have . That's why I'm not a too big fan of Phillip Noyce movies , with the exception of " Dead Calm " maybe , which simply had a very solid and tense story . " Clear and Present Danger " is a good made movie but it just is too simply and standard done all and it isn't really anything new . The cast is great and has some big names in it ; Harrison Ford , James Earl Jones , Harris Yulin , Donald Moffat , Henry Czerny , Joaquim de Almeida , Miguel Sandoval , Benjamin Bratt , Willem Dafoe , Ted Raimi in a small role and a still very young Thora Birch . The music by James Honer is really good . Even though it's typical Horner stuff , like he always used in his ' 90's movies , it works really well for the movie and truly uplifts the movie at times . There are some good moments in the movie that are highly memorable such as the convoy ambush which has become a bit of a classic already perhaps . Yes , the movie is perfectly watchable but the story isn't always the best to follow and at times the storytelling is lacking . Still , a movie that I would recommend to you .
484713	1416505	276816	7.0	The originality is the movie its biggest quality .	Director David Twohy likes mixing different genre elements and fooling the viewers . This movie is no exception since it perfectly mixes both mystery and horror elements . You never know what to expect next , which helps to make this movie a pleasant and original one to watch . The movie as a whole , though it comes close , never really works out quite fully , to be honest . The tension is lacking and in the end the movie doesn't explain enough , which perhaps causes the movie to leave an unsatisfying feeling in the end , with also some improbabilities because the things never get explained good enough . Nevertheless , it's the originality of the movie that causes this movie to still be a perfectly watchable one . The movie has some good scare - and false-scare moments . The movie also has more horror tendencies than mystery or dramatic ones . It however doesn't mean that this is just your standard average simple horror movie , so many already got made of , during this decade . The mixture of the mystery elements and the war movie elements also causes the horror moments to become original and non-formulaic . The submarine serves as a perfect claustrophobic backdrop for the movie its story . It certain en-chances the horror and it , again , also adds to the originality . My only complain about it would be that the submarine is too ' clean ' and perfect looking . Same goes for the costumes and faces of the actors . But that could be perhaps just me , comparing every WW II submarine movie to " Das Boot " . It's every WW II submarine movie and submarine movie's in general their curse to get immediately compared to " Das Boot " . The movie didn't had the highest of all budgets but that sort of is OK , since this normally always stimulates David Twohy's creativity to work . Nevertheless a movie like this one required to have a better budget and effects , mostly for the underwater sequences . It all is a bit too fake looking all to really take it serious enough . It also causes the underwater action to not really ever work out as spectacular and tense as intended to . The script ( co-written by Darren Aronofsky by the way ) and right intentions for it were there , just not always the right techniques and money . The movie has a great cast , with not the best known names in it but great actor nonetheless such as Bruce Greenwood , Olivia Williams and Dexter Fletcher . The movie has many characters in it but it makes some good choices regarding them . It gives the right characters at the right moments screen time . It doesn't cause the movie to ever get unnecessarily confusing or hard to follow because of the many characters . A great refreshing horror / mystery movie , set underwater .
484086	1416505	39926	7.0	Nice early little thriller .	This is a rather enjoyable movie that is nothing too impressive but is a good watch nevertheless . The movie begins slow and dull because it's mostly just so formulaic . From the beginning on it isn't clear which approach the movie picks and what the movie is all about . Really no thriller elements in the first halve , just some formulaic drama and romance . Only halve way through the movie the movie starts to become interesting when the thriller elements of the movie start to appear in to the story . The movie is more thriller than it's film-noir really , which might be a surprising thing , considering the time the year was made in . So yes , in a way the movie is quite original , despite being formulaic . It has a typical thriller build up that builds up that leads to the unavoidable ending . The movie has some good genre moments , which mostly works out due to the fine cast and suitable atmosphere of the movie . How often do we get to see Humphrey Bogart in the role of a psycho really ? That is quite awesome ! The supporting cast is also one to die for . Barbara Stanwyck was one of THE leading ladies at the time and Alexis Smith was also quite popular . Nigel Bruce , who everyone knows as THE Dr . Watson from the Sherlock Holmes movies starring Basil Rathbone , also plays a quite amusing small role in the movie . Despite its genre clichés , this is still a rather well made movie . It's effectively directed and the story flows well , despite being quite silly at times . It's an above average movie due to how professionally it's made and how well the actors handle the script and its more silly ( clichés ) and unbelievable moments . Perfectly watchable movie , especially for the Bogart fans , who want to see him in a role that is different .
484402	1416505	57259	7.0	A movie that knows how to entertain !	This movie is nothing too great , it's just some good old fashioned entertainment . The movie has a decent adventurous story that features all of the needed ingredients . It features the search for a treasure , rivaling parties and of course a fair maiden . It's no swashbuckler but it's not like it's a boring movie or anything . It's fast paced and always moving . It also features some nice action and battle sequences . Especially once the Vikings reach the land of the Moors , who are under the command of no one less than Sidney Poitier . When you think of Sidney Poitier you just don't think of a movie such as this one . He plays a sort of over-the-top villainous role and I bet he had a lot of fun doing so . But no , non of the actors give their finest performance out of their career but that is of course customary for a movie such as this , that is purely made for entertainment and not to sweep any awards or anything . It's a good looking movie with convincing sets and costumes and of course the unavoidable miniature effects . Especially for 1964 standards , this movie is fairly grand and expensive looking . There are not made that many adventurous entertaining movie about Vikings in the first place , so in that regard this movie is already something different and special from other entertaining adventurous genre movies . No doubt that the bad , brutal , barbaric kind of reputation of the Vikings in history is the reason why Hollywood has never really had the guts to make lots of more entertaining movies about them . It's above all a fun entertaining to watch . Hard to understand why this movie isn't any better known or appreciated . The movie succeeds at what it tries to achieve and it certainly is not worse than similar genre movies from the same period .
483830	1416505	473444	7.0	A family drama disguised as an epic material arts movie .	Basically in its core and essence the movie is on big family drama , in which every family member of the royal Chinese family has a secret to hide . The drama isn't really that interesting to follow and perhaps also feels overdone but luckily in between - and toward the ending , the movie has more than enough action to still give the movie pace , style and reasons enough to watch this movie . The movie is well directed , so the movie doesn't ever drag or becomes bad to watch , even though for a long time nothing is really happening in the movie . I mean basically the first 30 minutes of the movie are all about the empress having to drink her ' medicine ' daily , without much further story or character development . It are really two things that make this movie distinct itself from other genre movie ; It's action and the visual look of it . Well maybe 3 things if you also count the acting , that was really good in my opinion , though it always remains difficult to judge acting in a language that you don't speak yourself . The movie really is an epic in terms of its look but also definitely in terms of its action . The end battle toward the end of the movie that literally involves ten thousands of soldiers has an incredible epic feeling all over it . Also the action during the big battle does not disappoint and it's not just your average ' chop-work ' . But we are accustomed to this already , ever since the big success of " Wo hu cang long " . Also the much smaller fight sequences before the end battle are really good and impressive looking , with great choreography and nice weapons . It also isn't as over-the-top ( though it isn't exactly realistic either ) as in " Wo hu cang long " was the case , which is I think a positive thing . But the visual style is perhaps the most notable thing about the movie . The movie is very colorful and uses many bright colors , also mostly with its impressive looking costumes ( Oscar nominated ) . It also helps to make the movie a memorable viewing experience . I am normally not a big fan of this particular type of Asian cinema but after seeing this movie I wouldn't mind seeing more movies like it .
484928	1416505	74991	7.0	Not De Palma's best but it shows his qualities .	The Brian De Palma today isn't the Brian De Palma he used to be . Early on in his career he made some truly brilliant - and also often very underrated and under-appreciated movies . " Obsession " is one of his earlier movies , made before his big breakthrough with the movie " Carrie " . Although this movie certainly isn't among his best it's still an above average genre movie , due to De Palma's direction quality . It's obvious that the biggest influence in De Palma's work is Hitchcock . Some people call him a Hitchcock rip-off but his movies are often simply too good and classy for that . Nothing wrong with someone carrying on Hitchcock's work in a more modern day and age of film-making . De Palma's movies are often very old fashioned in their style and way of storytelling . Whenever a movie attempts to be old fashioned , like movies from the ' 40's , it often ends up being a complete failure . De Palma however often succeeds in this , as is the case - though to some less extend , with this movie . This is far from a perfect genre movie and those who are familiar with these type of movies can see the twists coming from miles away . It's a very little surprising movie that however still has plenty of qualities that uplift it . The main thing that keeps this movie down is really its story . It's rather slow ( because it's done in an old fashioned style ) and it's made even slower by its main character that looks depressed all of the time . It's hard to really care for him when he's walking around so moody all of the time . Hard to say if this is Cliff Robertson's fault , or the script or directing . Probably all three are too blame for it . It nevertheless remains a very pleasant movie to watch , due to its style . It's a real good looking movie , that with Vilmos Zsigmond also has a nice director of photography involved . It was the first collaboration between him and Brian De Palma , out of 4 movies they did together so far . The fine musical score is from Alfred Hitchcock's steady composer Bernard Herrmann , which really helps to set the right mood for this movie as well . He died shortly afterward . He was supposed to become Brian De Palma's new main composer but it unfortunately wasn't to be . The movie has some real typical trademark Brian De Palma moments in them . Sequences that make the movie great and memorable , even when the rest of the movie just isn't that great or interesting to watch . The ending is also typical De Palma-like , even though it isn't the best or most satisfying ending imaginable for the movie . It was also great to see a still fairly young John Litgow in this movie . It was one of his first movie roles and he did a great job within this movie , especially with his accent . He later also appeared in other De Palma movies , though ironically never his best known ones . A good early De Palma movie , that already shows his talent and trademark style , that made me a fan of his work , even his lesser movies .
484834	1416505	408236	7.0	Surprisingly good but I had some problems with this movie .	First of all I love Tim Burton and the dark style he always manages to put in his movies but I feel that he somewhat overdid it this time , which perhaps is not as much Burton's fault but more the story's . For me the main problem with this movie was its story and then particularly its characters . There just is no good character within this movie . All of the characters are evil in a way . Sweeney Todd is supposed to be the main ' hero ' but he isn't much of a likable character , since he's a person who slices innocent people's throats . There isn't really a person to sympathize for within this movie . It's like you're watching all bad people , which in a way also somewhat makes this a depressing movie to watch . I know this certain darkness suits Tim Burton well and is part of his trademark style but I just feel he overdid it this time and it doesn't work out as well as it does in most of his other movies . He perhaps also overdid things with the movie its visuals . The movie is so stylish and done mostly in gray and black & white tints that the movie looks fake at times , as if it came straight out of a computer . The fairytale like feeling and dark Gothic atmosphere Tim Burton is so well known for is mostly missing within this movie and perhaps Burton too much tried to make this movie like an old horror movie from the black & white era . Also some of the computer effects within this movie feel pointless , mostly because of the reason that they look like they come straight out of playstation game cut scene . It's pointless and it doesn't add anything to the movie . It instead only lets the movie look even more artificial and fake then it already does . Nevertheless the movie turned out to be in a way also better than expected really . I mean a dark violent musical ? Sounds like a real odd and bad thing on paper but it's a movie that works out surprisingly well and knows to combine it's violence , images and musical moments nicely , even though I wasn't that impressed by its musical moments and not a too big fan of the movie its visuals . The story did worked out well and surprisingly , despite of its earlier mentioned flaw of not really featuring any likable characters . I must also say that out of all the Tim Burton and Johnny Depp collaborations , this is probably the least . Why ? Because Johnny Depp doesn't really feel like Johnny Depp in this movie . Perhaps it's because of the style of the movie or all of the make-up he has to act underneath but there are only a handful of great Johnny Depp moments within the movie . It's as if most of the time he is restrained , which is probably also due to the fact that he has a lot of singing to do in this movie . Sacha Baron Cohen on the other hand was really great and perfectly cast . In a way he plays more of Johnny Depp type of role than Jonny Depp played within this movie . Cohen's role is quite small though but nevertheless memorable and entertaining . Alan Rickman is also fine and so is Tim Burton's girlfriend Helena Bonham Carter , who always perfectly fits into his movies and style in particular . So , it's a movie that works out surprising well and I can also recommend it but this doesn't take away I had some problems with the movie its style and main characters .
485518	1416505	20489	7.0	In bed with Laurel & Hardy .	Perhaps it's because that this movie is probably the Laurel & Hardy short I've seen most in my life that I got sort of tiresome of watching it but I don't find this movie to be the most hilarious or best constructed and executed Laurel & Hardy comedy short around . But you know , when you watch this movie objectively just for what it is , so not necessarily as a part of the Laurel & Hardy shorts alone you have to conclude that this is a pretty entertaining and fun little movie . The movie its premise is extremely simple and gives both Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardsy to let their comical talents shine , since they're basically the only two actors in the movie , except for the last couple of minutes in which Laurel & Hardy regular Charlie Hall , among others , shows up as the landlord . The comical routines are rather simple but I guess they are effective enough , since they surely amuse . It just isn't the most hilarious or imaginative Laurel & Hardy comedy around but that doesn't of course mean that this movie is bad or not entertaining .
484995	1416505	59749	7.0	An original take on the genre but too blah for my taste .	This is not just your average spy movie . It chooses a realistic approach , with a slowly told story and an humane main ' normal ' character . No action or fancy tricks here , just a normal every day looking spy who tries to infiltrate by the ' enemy ' with words , rather than actions . Nothing wrong with a movie that has much dialog but it has to be good enough to keep and grab your attention . This however isn't always the case in this particular movie . The dialog does tend to make this movie unnecessary hard to follow at times . The movie chooses to tell its story through its dialog rather than by the actors or images themselves . For most part it works effective enough but it also makes the movie drag and uninteresting to watch at times . The movie makes it too hard on itself . The fact that this is a cold war thriller made during the cold war itself gives the movie a certain bit of extra . It helps to make the atmosphere an absolutely fantastic one . No way a movie with a story like this could be made as effective and realistic present day . Its atmosphere is definitely one of the reasons why the movie works out so well and realistic . Of course another reason is Richard Burton . He plays a ' not so everyday ' spy . He is far from perfect and he rather seems and acts like a bum , instead of a cool , agile spy . This is of course a far more realistic take on the spy movie genre . Burton , through his role , is the main reason why the movie works well and effective . The movie is filled with some other good but mostly unknown actors . Bernard Lee and Walter Gotell also pop up in the movie . It's sort of fun seeing these two actors together in a different spy movie than the James Bond movies . It's story is for most part intriguing and features some good and interesting layers in it that makes this an excellent and original thriller and genre movie . The movie is good looking , despite the surprising fact that the movie was not shot in Germany ( where the movie for most part is set ) at all . The movie is filmed brilliant entirely in black & white . The camera-work is just great and every sequences is eye candy to look at . Also the musical score is surprisingly good and effective . So all in all , it's a very stylish and beautiful looking movie , that becomes a bit too unnecessary hard to follow at certain moments because of its many and complex dialog .
483936	1416505	346156	7.0	Entertaining and ' new ' .	This movie delivers some solid entertainment and the ' new ' way of movie making also makes this movie interesting to watch . The visual look and feeling are fantastic . It's pretty obvious that Kerry Conran was inspired by " Metropolis " . The atmosphere is truly wonderful and give the movie an unique look and feeling . I for one applaud this new way of movie making and I'm looking forward to new Kerry Conran projects . Still the movie has many missed opportunities . From a movie like this you would expect many big spectacular dogfights but the movie and the action is set just mainly on the ground . The movie is more of an Indiana Jones like adventure than anything else . As for the action itself , it isn't incredibly memorable . Oh and the movie features some horrible fake German accents . It's very obvious that the German persons in this movie are not played by real Germans . Not really a complaint but more something that could had been improved . The movie features some well known actors and surprisingly the best in my eyes was Giovanni Ribisi . Truly the best role I have seen him in till date . The story itself also isn't very appealing . The whole Totenkopf plot doesn't really work out well and I would had much more preferred the movie to concentrate more on the dogfights and those huge and fantastic destructive machines . Still the movie does deliver some solid entertainment and more than enough visual beauty and I find this movie to be very recommendable .
485273	1416505	330793	7.0	Brutal action flick .	This is a very straight forward action flick with lots of violence and tough characters . Fans of the action genre will most definitely not be disappointed by this movie . From the start on , you know that this movie is a violent one that doesn't hold back . After we've seen the entire family of Frank Castle being killed ( and I mean every single last family member , both young and old ) you know that this movie is going to be different from most other action movies . It's a movie that is very straight forward and doesn't hold back but at the very same time it doesn't try to force , or go too much over-the-top . I think this is most probably thanks to the directing skills of Jonathan Hensleigh and the talented cast that was involved with this movie that makes it a very enjoyable , cool and still somewhat credible , summer-action-flick . The story is basically very simple and is set around one very simple good old fashioned concept ; vengeance , or maybe even better said ; punishment . It's not really a sort of action movie that needs much story . The characters , both the main ' hero ' and the main villain are interesting enough to carry the entire movie and make it a very pleasant one to watch . Even though the main ' hero ' is pretty dark and brutal himself , you still root for him because you understand him . Thomas Jane is pretty good as the leading man and he proves that he is a great and perhaps somewhat underrated action movie star . It's always a pleasure to see John Travolta in a villainous role and he certainly also does not disappoint in this movie . Same goes for Will Patton , who also was really great in this movie ( he's beginning to look old and fat now by the way . ) . Roy Scheider also shows up in a small role , or better said cameo as Frank Castle Sr . Kevin Nash plays a pretty cool role as a Russian hit-man . The fight sequence between him and the main character was one of the highlights of the movie to me . But seriously , were all those sequence's with the Punisher's neighbors really necessary ? I understand that they were put in the movie to still give the main character an humane and more soft side but the sequences just didn't worked out good enough and perhaps only were distracting from the main plot line . The sequences also are really a waste of Rebecca Romijn's qualities . She doesn't get to do anything good or interesting in the movie . Why did she even agreed to be in this ? It's nothing too memorable all and the action and story themselves are nothing more than average but it's the straight-forwardness of the movie that makes me regard this one as an above average one , that has more to offer than the average , simple action flick . The style of the movie also ain't bad and hopefully we'll hear more from director Jonathan Hensleigh ( who already is a successful writer of many well known action movies ) in the future .
484443	1416505	110428	7.0	Visually a great movie with great performances .	" The Madness of King George " is far from an excellent movie and a must see but nevertheless it's still both fun and wonderful to watch . The costumes and sets are great and Sir Nigel Hawthorne really carries the movie with his wonderful performance . The movie is more of a comedy than a drama really . The movie is filled with some humorous moments , dialogs and characters . Only problem I had with the movie was that it focused on way too many and unneeded characters . Also because of this , Sir Ian Holm's character gets seriously underused . A bit of an ungrateful role for Sir Ian Holm . They could have used his acting skills in a better manner . Basically the movie is just a little bit over 1 hour and 40 minutes of fun entertainment with some nice humor and an impressive Sir Nigel Hawthorne .
484073	1416505	188404	7.0	Nostalgic value = 10 , quality = 5 .	" Als je begrijpt wat ik bedoel " is based on a very popular Dutch cartoon figure which whom whole generations grew up with . The movie knows to capture the comic book feeling on screen , which makes the nostalgic value of the movie very high . Even though the movie has a fun feeling the undertone is dramatic and emotional , which is the most powerful thing of the movie . It is a movie that even the most tough adults will be moved by and it isn't unusual for some to shed some tears . The character ( even though they are animals ) are very humane and realistic which makes the emotions work even better . The characters are brought to life by an excellent voice cast . The quality however is not very good . The movie looks sloppy and outdated . The animations are pretty standard and simple but effective . There are some weird musical numbers that are far from good and also the music itself doesn't quite seem to fit the movie and is used at weird periods throughout the movie . See it for the nostalgic value , however if you live outside the Netherlands or Belgium you can not fully appreciate this movie and it might not be worth your time .
485511	1416505	94737	7.0	Movie made interesting by Hanks .	The success of the movie is mainly thanks to Tom Hanks performance that awarded him his first Oscar nomination . The story and the movie itself are pretty simple and a bit corny at times but who really cares ? It is a family movie and doesn't need any complexity . The only thing that troubled me about the story was that Josh did all kind of things that an 12 year old would never do when he finds himself in a grown up body . Instead of doing all kind of grown up things and taking advantage of it in certain situations , he chooses to do all kind of playful things , which was a bit corny and simple in my opinion but that's why it's a family movie . It sounds weird but I think this movie is already a bit outdated even though it is only 16 years old . The story and the toys and the use of it are the main reasons why I think it is outdated and why kids might not find this movie so appealing as kids did 16 years ago . Also , the typical ' 80's soundtrack ( you know what I mean ) doesn't make the movie any younger . The characters and the actors are good . John Heard plays aside from Tom Hanks a good role . Above average comedy that is worth seeing but that will not stand the test of time .
484303	1416505	93300	7.0	Honestly , the second best of the " Jaws " series .	This movie doesn't receive much love but I think it really deserves some . It's understandable why this movie is regarded as a bad one . It's the third establishment in a series of unneeded " Jaws " sequels . Both 2 and 3 were disappointing movies , especially compared to the first of course so how could the third sequel be possibly any better ? It's easy to bash a movie like this but I'm not going with the majority here on this one . I'll explain why I feel that this is the second best movie from the " Jaws " series . Despite the previous two sequels it actually tries to recapture the atmosphere of the first movie . Also of course the fact that Lorraine Gary reprises her role as Ellen Brody adds to this feeling and atmosphere . The movie has lots of returning character and references to the first " Jaws " movie , something that the previous two sequels mostly ignored . This movie is actually the closest to the first " Jaws " movie in its atmosphere , story and tension . The only reason why this movie is not as good as the first " Jaws " movie is the fact that it hasn't got the characters Quint , Chief Brody and Hooper in it . Also of course Spielbergs skill and subtle touch is missing and so is John Williams ' musical score . The use of some archive footage from the first " Jaws " movie , in some flashbacks scenes might be a bit cheap but in my opinion it works effective . It perfectly binds the first and last establishment of the " Jaws " series . It also explains the ' lame ' story better . The story is that a shark wants to take revenge on all the Brody's . It's of course incredibly silly that a shark would ever do such a thing but a story like this was necessary to put an end to the " Jaws " series . After this vengeful shark would die , it would be highly unbelievable that any of the Brody's would have a later encounter with a great white . This sort of story was simply needed to put an end to the series and for me it's really satisfying . It is a really great and enjoyable monster movie . It has some well build up and executed sequences and an ending that also doesn't disappoint . In my opinion it's a great way to end the " Jaws " series , even though my opinion still is that none of the " Jaws " sequels should had ever been made because they are simply pointless .
484921	1416505	497318	8.0	The academy regained some if its credibility .	Not only was this is a good show to watch , also most of the winners were surprising . No movie swept away the awards and the ' big ' Oscars were evenly handed among the favorite movies of the evening . It made it a very unpredictable evening and because of that it also was fun to watch . It's never fun to see one movie just win all of the ' big ' Oscars , especially when the movie is not deserving enough of it . So , for the more neutral and unbiased viewer , like myself , this was a great awards show in which the Adademy Awards , for me , regained some of its credibility and respect . The show was fast paced and there weren't any slow or distracting moments . All of the presenters were good and didn't try to be forced funny all the time , like often in the past was the case . As for Jon Stewart , he surprised me . I never really had been a fan of him but he was a great presenter of the evening . Unlike the other presenters from the past , he stood there as a presenter that told some fun jokes in between and not as a comedian who tried to make the audience laugh with basically every single sentence . Stewart never overdid things and because of that he was a great presenter that also was fun to listen to . A bit disappointing however were the montages . I normally always enjoy the montages during the Oscars but the montages used this year contained some weird and unimpressive movie choices at times . It also got a bit tiresome after a while when they kept repeating to the viewers that they should watch movies in theater's rather than home on DVD or on portable-DVD . It felt like one big , unpaid for , advert that in my opinion also was just totally pointless . As for the winners . . . Like I said before , it was a great evening for the neutral movie-viewer . It was a mostly unpredictable evening , with some great and also some surprising winners . The Oscars were handed out extremely even and fair this year . " King Kong " took home 3 Oscar , as well as " Memoirs of a Geisha " , " Crash " and " Brokeback Mountain " . " King Kong " won the most important technical awards , " Memoirs of a Geisha " the most important visual awards and both " Crash " and " Brokeback Mountain " won the ' big ' important awards . So , it was a very balanced evening for most movies . Not all of the awards were a surprise though of course . Most movie buffs already knew that it was simply bound to happen once , that Philip Seymour Hoffman would win an Oscar for best actor and it really was no surprise to anyone that he won this year for his role in " Capote " . It also was fairly determined that Reese Witherspoon would receive the Oscar for best actress , which she also did . Judi Dench already had received enough nominations and credit , plus she already won an Oscar once , Charlize Theron already one won recently , Keira Knightley will almost certainly still win an Oscar later within about 5 or maybe 10 years , the way her career progresses at the moment . She's young , talented and beautiful , so she'll get there . And Felicity Huffman . . . yeah right , like she even had a chance . So no , also Reese Witherspoon was surely no surprise , also because she already had won many other big awards this year for her role in " Walk the Line " . Also no real surprises were ; " La Marche de l'empereur " for best documentary feature , " Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit " for best animated feature film and George Clooney for his supporting role in the movie " Syriana " . Clooney was nominated two more times , first best screenplay and directing for " Good Night , and Good Luck . " . Three nominations , so he was almost bound to receive one . For best screenplay and best directing would had been too controversial , so giving him one for his acting seemed like a fair and predictable move . Clooney himself also knew that he wouldn't receive the Oscar for best screenplay or directing after he had one the best supporting actor award . Of course biggest surprise of the evening was " Crash " winning the best picture award , especially after Ang Lee already had won the best director award during the evening . Everyone basically assumed that " Brokeback Mountain " would win best picture and most of the other important awards of the evening , with maybe " Good Night , and Good Luck . " as the most important underdog . Yeah sure " Crash " had 6 nominations this evening but honestly , who would had ever expected it to win so many and important awards . The movie almost didn't seem to make a chance to win against " Brokeback Mountain " and any of the other movies nominated . But yet it won , which is good for the unpredictability , surprise and credibility level of this year's award ceremony . All in all , " The 78th Annual Academy Awards " was an unpredictable and fun evening with a good presented - and fast show set around it . 2005 was a great and competitive year for the Oscar's . No one will totally agree with the Oscar's handed out this year but for the neutral viewer there was plenty to enjoy .
484370	1416505	307987	8.0	A Christmas movie that isn't a Christmas movie by the usual standards .	This is one rather special and certainly original Christmas movie . It still has the Christmas spirit and message in it but it delivers it in a never-seen-before package . Never has there been so much profanities and sex in a Christmas movie before and most likely there never will be again . It all works out well though for the movie and it makes its comedy and originality stand out . Billy Bob Thornton is a Santa Clause unlike any other . He swears in front of children , drinks a lot , enjoys anal sex with women and he basically doesn't care about anything . Besides , he's a thief and an expert at safe-cracking . All very convenient , when you as a Santa Clause in shopping mall have access to the safe , after closing time . But as you could expect this all slightly changes , once he meets a young , fat , not too bright kid , who starts to regard him as his second father . This sounds very sentimental and also very predictable for a Christmas movie but due to the movie its approach you can never accuse this movie of not being original . The sentimentality and messages of the movie all work out so well because of this . It's not a laughing-out-loud type of comedy but more of a subtle one , that is funny due to its very profanity and contrasts it shows with the usual Christmas movies . Quite a daring project but yet the movie never raised any objection and protest because of the simple reason that it's such a fine movie . Truly finally a Christmas movie that got aimed completely toward the adult audience . Of course part of the reason why the movie works out so well is Billy Bob Thornton's performance , for which he even received a Golden Globe nomination but lost to Bill Murray , for his role in " Lost in Translation " . Ironicaly enough Bill Murray was first signed on for the lead role in this movie but later dropped out to do " Lost in Translation " instead . The movie also truly has one fine supporting cast with actors like Tony Cox , John Ritter and Bernie Mac involved . The acting feels really natural within this movie , which is really thanks to the approach of director Terry Zwigoff . It's a quite slowly told movie , that never pretends to be more than it is and doesn't feature any big sequences . Instead really little and subtle sequences , with some static camera-work and long shots , with often some nimble editing involved to capture even further the emptiness and also the subtle absurd-ism of the movie . It's like a Wes Anderson-Christmas movie , only done better and way funnier than something he has ever done in his career !
484972	1416505	60841	8.0	Atmospheric Hammer zombie-flick .	It's really a shame Hammer didn't made more zombie movies after this one . Pre - " Night of the Living Dead " made zombie movie always had a fantastic stylish and creepy atmosphere . Examples of this are movies like " White Zombie " , " I Walked with a Zombie " and also most certainly this movie . It weren't movies with real scares in it but it more were movies with a well build up tension and a consistent mysterious and creepy atmosphere . After " Night of the Living Dead " zombie movies were never the same again . Had Hammer continued making zombie movies after this movie , perhaps the genre of stylish atmospheric zombie movies would still be around these days . This is a slowly told - and build up movie . It takes it time to set-up the right atmosphere and tension . It makes this movie a mysterious one , that was made with lots of style . Wonderfully directed by John Gilling all ! He never chooses to over-do things in this movie , even though he could had easily done this . The zombies are not portrayed as horror-characters but more as servants that obey their master . There aren't really many well known Hammer horror elements present in the movie or story , which will perhaps disappoint the hardened Hammer fan . It's a bit of a shame that there aren't really well known Hammer actors in this movie . The movie could had really done good with Peter Cushing and / or Christopher Lee in it . That doesn't of course mean that the actors in this movie aren't much good . André Morell is a fantastic actor and he played in classics like ; " The Hound of the Baskervilles " , " Ben-Hur " , " Barry Lyndon " and " The Bridge on the River Kwai " . He has a wonderful voice and accent . Also great was John Carson as the charismatic ' villain ' . This movie might perhaps bore some people , since it isn't fast paced and it doesn't feature any formulaic horror sequences but I still feel that everyone must be able to appreciate this movie its atmosphere and the mystery elements .
485569	1416505	241282	8.0	Nice subject .	This movie short can go down in history as the first ever Edison production to be filmed outdoors . It picked an interesting and nice subject of having a rope and slack wire walker doing a couple of tricks outdoors . The rope and slack wire walker is Juan A . Caicedo . A Venezuelan who performed a couple of times in the United States , also in 1894 , when this film got shot . He really shows that he was not just any ordinary rope and slack wire walker and he does lots of jumping and bouncing within this movie , without of course falling off , or every loosing his balance . He is not on an incredible height but the things he does do look pretty dangerous nonetheless . I for one certainly wouldn't want to attempt trying all that he does within this movie short . No wonder he got called the ' king of the wire ' . It seems pretty amazing to me that he actually managed to stay within the camera it's field . A real achieved once you see what kind of tricks he does . Sort of makes you wonder how many takes it took them to finally get the right and wanted result . You can also conclude from this that this movie was well staged and set up by its director , whoever that was . Most likely it was just William Heise , the camera operator who also performed the directing duties that this movie short required . A nice to watch kinetographic experiment .
483743	1416505	265208	8.0	Great teenage comedy .	This is a sweet romantic teenage comedy that is better than you might expect it to be . It has an intelligent story with some great characters and a believable well constructed love-story . High-school and ex high-school students should be able to recognize a lot in the movie its story and characters . The movie delivers on several levels . As a comedy this movie is fun and certainly entertaining , mainly thanks to the well casted actors . Especially Timothy Olyphant is truly great and enjoyable in his ' villainish ' porn producer role . Also as a romantic movie , this movie is a really successful one . The love-story is good and mainly , also very original . Basically this movie is a pleasure to watch , from start to finish . The story has some great turns in twists in it and you never know what is going to happen next . It tries to avoid as many teenage movie cliché's as possible but still unfortunately falls in some traps at times . Still the movie is way better than most other teenage comedies currently being made and some that were made in the ' 80's , which was the golden age of teenage comedies . This is due to the well written story and characters and the actors that portray them . The movie is fun and at times also hilarious . It's a very entertaining movie to watch for all ages but mainly for teenagers of course who should be able to recognize some of the elements in this movie . The movie also has some great use of some great music .
485310	1416505	22058	8.0	A great example of how a Laurel & Hardy short should be .	This is a very typical Laurel & Hardy short . It's filled with some typical and very well executed slapstick humor . This is a great example of how a Laurel & Hardy movie should be . It's no secret that Laurel & Hardy made their best picture together in the early ' 30's . This movie is definitely one of their greatest and most enjoyable ones . The first halve of the movie is mostly filled with slapstick comedy . It's most definitely the best part of the movie . The comical slapstick moments are typical and amazingly funny , mostly due to the fact how well executed and timed they are . The second halve of the movie drags on for a bit too long and doesn't rely anymore so much on its slapstick and visual humor . If only the movie would had been about 10 minutes shorter , how great than it would had been . Not saying that it isn't great or enjoyable enough now but yet the movie had more potential of becoming truly one of the greatest or most memorable Laurel & Hardy shorts . Their mishaps with Laughing Gravy the dog are funny and provide the movie with its best moments . Also good are the comical moments with the landlord played by Laurel & Hardy regular Charlie Hall , who of course doesn't like the boys having living a dog around in his house . Still it makes me wonder why they didn't gave James Finlayson the part and why didn't Arthur Houseman played the drunk in this one ? I missed the both of them in this movie and I had the feeling that the movie would had been even a more fun one with them . A near perfect slapstick comedy , that more or less falls short of greatness in its second halve , which prevent this movie from being the best or most memorable Laurel & Hardy comedy short but nevertheless it's one of their most fun and typical comedy shorts around .
484167	1416505	9968	8.0	A silent movie like only D . W . Griffith could make them .	It's amazing to see how incredibly good all of D . W . Griffith's movies are , especially considering he made his best work in the 1910's and 1920's , when movie-making was a relatively new medium and there weren't any other movie-makers around on the same league as Griffith to compare the work to . D . W . Griffith was truly a pioneer in modern movie-making . His techniques and ways of storytelling were unique for the medium and set the later standards for modern movie making . But on top of that , in todays perspective , his movies remain just as good , interesting and entertaining to watch . It makes his movies not only historically relevant and revolutionary but also a pure simple pleasure to watch . No , I don't regard " Broken Blossoms or The Yellow Man and the Girl " as one of his best works but that isn't saying much about the quality of it . The quality is still superb and the movie features a fascinating story with great characters in it . It's interesting to see how well layered the story is . It handles lots of relevant themes and points out some daring new one's , for 1919 standards , such as an interracial relationship . The overall underlying message of the movie was how hardened society has become and how easily we resolve to violence , rather than to look further than the first glance , or take the trouble to place yourself is someone else's shoes . In essence this is a movie about the good old subject of good versus evil , love versus hate . The story is for most part told from the viewpoint of a Chinese who want to spread love and peace , from the learning of the Buddha over the world . He soon gives up this mission when he arrives in England and learns there is no hope in trying to help - and change this society . He soon after than opens a store and starts a new life until when he falls in love with a young girl , whose father is a brute . The movie obviously is a melodramatic one but like with all D . W . Griffith's movies is the case , it all works out extremely effective and powerful . Especially toward the ending of the movie the drama becomes powerful and works surprising effective . The movie just works out perfectly and often let the images speak for them selves . The movie is beautifully looking with some very convincing looking - and big sets and moody cinematography by the early professional . The movie also uses some close-ups and even extreme close-ups , which wasn't too common for its time period and it works surprising well for the movie its storytelling - and to set up the right mood and tension of a sequences . The acting is of course over-the-top , for the obvious reasons . Back in the silent movie era , actors always had to exaggerate in their posses and movements to tell the story and to create the right emotions and atmosphere of the sequence . Especially Donald Crisp does this . It seems pretty weird that most of the Chinese and at least the ones that are the main characters , are being portrayed by non-Asian actors under a lot of make-up . It really isn't very credible looking but it's a technique not uncommon for it's time period . Even decades later , often western actors would portray Asian characters . Best example of this is of course Mickey Rooney in his 1961 performance in " Breakfast at Tiffany's " . A both powerful and just great to watch silent-movie , from D . W . Griffith .
485257	1416505	373889	8.0	The most bold and daring Harry Potter movie as of yet .	Lots of people at the time praised " Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban " for its dark approach and atmosphere . Well , if " Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban " was a dark movie , than this is an ultra-dark movie . " Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban " was a semi-dark children / fantasy movie that never really dared to cross the line . " Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix " is not afraid to this though . I must say that this movie is actually closer to horror than fantasy in my opinion . It had an incredible atmosphere , with also some classic build up horror moments . There is little room left for fun in this movie and it's all very serious . Yes , perhaps a bit too serious though . I felt that the movie could had used some relieving humor at times , something all of the other Harry Potter movies were still loaded with . No , I'm not a great Harry Potter fan and never will be probably , but I have to give it credit for some thing . The series perfectly adapt to the maturing of the main characters as well as the viewers / readers . In other children book series the readers / viewers of course mature over the years , but the stories don't mature with them and everything remains just the same as the first book / movie . I praise the Harry Potter series for not doing so . So the movie is quite different from any of the previous other Harry Potter movies . It has a new style , which provides the movie with a different atmosphere . This is being empathized all the more by the different musical score from the still unknown Nicholas Hooper . I liked this idea . A new approach calls for a new style , also in the music . None of the themes sound familiar or reminds us of any of the other previous Harry Potter movies . The movie is more political than fun . The whole taking over Hogwarts thing by the ministry was done quite nicely and interesting . Harry and friends need to face some serious grown up difficulties now . Voldermort is back , no doubt , which means that there now needs to be fought in a battle between life and death . So no giant spiders , house elves , games of quidditch , brewing potions behind closed doors or snakes this time , but a real murderous evil villain , with dangerous followers , that needs to be stopped . I'm sort of fed up though with all of these new characters that constantly get introduced in every new Harry Potter movie . It's of course not that any of those characters are bad , or being portrayed by horrible actors , but it just goes at the expensive of already some fine and established actors , such as Minerva , Dumbledore , Snape and Hagrid , who are now all being pushed more to the background . The movie is now filled with literally dozens of characters , that are not all getting the attention they need and deserve . This is a very recommendable movie , especially if you thought that all of the Harry Potter movies were still too childish .
485033	1416505	20708	8.0	Laurel & Hardy as REAL kids this time !	Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were of course already big kids in their movies but this time they also play kids . Beside the roles of the two young children , Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy , of course also portray the two fathers . This guarantees some hilarious sequences between the two kids and the two fathers . Most of the time Laurel & Hardy are playing against , well , Laurel & Hardy . It makes some of the sequences work out all the more hilarious . For the sequences with the children the sets are made to look larger . So large toys , a large bed and a large bathroom , among other things . It makes the movie good looking and above all also very original . Of course Laurel & Hardy look nothing like children , after all they both were close to 40 years old at the time of this movie . Yet it becomes very believable because of the acting of the two with each other . They both help each other out in this movie to make their performances work out as both good and hilarious . The movie features some really great and funny sequences , such as Oliver going done a staircase on a roller-skate and Laurel & Hardy being washed away by a large flood wave . The movie has some truly unique and hilarious comical moments in it that makes " Brats " an original as well as an hilarious comedy short . It also features plenty of enough slapstick to please the fans but it above all is a movie that should entertain just basically everybody . Not just your typical average Laurel & Hardy comedy short !
484690	1416505	381849	8.0	Even bad men love their mommas .	The western now days is a pretty dead genre . Only a couple of times every now and then a wonderful genre movie gets suddenly released again , of which " 3 : 10 to Yuma " is the most recent example . The movie isn't really a classic western , in terms of that it uses all of the clichés and techniques you would expect from the genre . It above all is a modern movie , that also takes an original approach to the genre . It of course features lots of tough looking and talking man but in the end the movie is all about trying to be a better man , no matter how black your heart seems . Yes , it's a movie that is being driven by its story and characters but it's also a movie that has plenty of action in it . It still makes this an action movie but one with some more heart and soul to it . You can of course expect a little bit more from a movie starring both Russell Crowe and Christian Bale opposite each other . The movie is of course being almost completely carried by its two principal actors but luckily the movie doesn't forget that it also has other great actors playing some nice roles in this movie , such as Peter Fonda and Ben Foster . The movie gives its actors plenty of opportunity to shine throughout . It's perhaps a bit of a long movie and it perhaps isn't always interesting enough but it builds up nicely to its ending , that is more than another big action sequences or shoot out but also shows how the characters have changed and most importantly grown throughout the entire movie . It's a visually impressive looking movie , with nice scenery and settings . The movie has a visual and technical modern approach to it but it still feels like an old fashioned genre movie , mostly due to its pace and settings . You don't have to be into westerns to like this movie and you don't have to be afraid when you are into westerns that this movie might not be faithful enough to its genre . A movie well worth seeing .
484109	1416505	71408	8.0	Atmospheric retelling of the Ed Gein story .	Even though all of the character names within this movie are changed , most likely for legal reasons , this movie tells the story of one of the most infamous killers of all time ; Ed Gein . Of course some changes are made within the movie and the movie doesn't tell the whole story of Ed Gein but overall in its main lines it can be considered a fairly accurate movie . Ed Gein is of course a real interesting killer because of the very odd things he did , not as much to his victims but more because of the fact he was also a grave-robber who dug up his own deceased mother and took her into his home again . He dug up several more recently deceased middle aged woman , who resembled his mother in order to use their skin to patch up his mother's body with . He became real fascinated with anatomy and that of the female body in particular . He became so fascinated he wanted to become a woman himself and he made ' suits ' out of the skin of deceased women , which he could wear . He also made various other objects from parts of death bodies . A real amazing story , which inspired many film-makers over the years . This makes it all the more odd that there never really have been a good decent Ed Gein movie around . This one is probably the best one to watch out there , even though it changed all of the character names and it doesn't focus entirely on the life story of Ed Gein . There of course was a lot wrong in Ed Gein's life and inside his head in particular but this movie does not choose to waste much time on showing how he became the man he was and what drove him to his actions . It simply concentrates on the relationship he had with his mother and how she influenced his life entirely even long time after her death . This movie doesn't try to be overly complicated and a real thoroughly character study of a serial killer . This is what makes " Deranged " an easy to grasp and watch movie . It also makes it a ' pleasant ' one , since it's also definitely a movie with a certain quirky kind of sense over it . You know , come to think of it , I think the Coen brothers would be the perfect candidates to make a story about Ed Gein's life . Also a real strong point of this movie is its atmosphere . This movie obviously was an ultra-low budget one , which works out actually quite well for the movie its atmosphere and overall realism . I honestly doubt this movie would had been better , had it had a multi-million dollar budget . One thing a multi-million dollar could had given the movie though would be some better actors to play the movie its roles . With all respect but none of the actors within the movie are among the most talented ones . It's true that it adds to the certain quirkiness and ' fun ' of the movie , also since the movie obviously doesn't attempt to conceal it isn't the most professional movie ever made with the most talented actors involved . The movie also doesn't really show any of the killings or how Gein ( or in this movie Ezra Cobb ) skinned any of his dug up bodies and how he made items out of them . So if you're expecting a bloody and gory ' 70's horror flick this is not the movie for you . It's not an exploitation flick and in that regard this movie is also really quite original for ' 70's standards . A really recommendable , atmospheric , little low-budget retelling of the Ed Gein story , that you give a go .
483845	1416505	48960	8.0	An adventure of great proportion !	The thing that surprised me about this movie was how big this production was . Thousands of extras and costumes and dozens of cameo's in a trip around the world . Unfortunately the movie has lost some of its power throughout the years . It is beginning to get outdated and it almost seems like a miracle these days that this movie has won 5 Oscar's including the one for best picture in 1957 . Especially the pace is outdated , there are some endless long scene's that just don't seem to end and go on and on . The movie is filled with cameo's ( the first movie ever ) . But I'm ashamed to say that I hardly recognized anyone . We are talking about 1956 here , those who were big stars back then are now long since gone . The only one I recognized was Sir John Gielgud , no I even didn't recognized Frank Sinatra or Marlene Dietrich . David Niven was in his element and was a great leading man . I can't say that I'm completely happy with the casting choice of Cantinflas as Passepartout but fortunately it doesn't ruin the movie in any way . The story is great and adventurous , there are countless fun and entertaining moments in this epic production .
484586	1416505	106292	8.0	Such a fine enjoyable movie !	Don't ask me why but when I was younger I would often watch this movie and the first one ; " Stakeout " . Of those two movies this is the one that has always stayed most in my mind . Basically this movie is just great entertainment . Like all those type of movies from that period there isn't much to the story and the movie is all about its characters and actors playing them . Compare it to the ' Lethal Weapon ' movies , minus all of the action . This movie does have some fine characters and actors portraying them . Even better is the chemistry they all have . Richard Dreyfuss form Emilio Estevez a great ' buddy ' cop duo and Rosie O'Donnell is also a fine addition to the two , basically since she is such a fine comedy actress . It also sort of makes you wonder why Richard Dreyfuss hasn't appeared in more comedy roles . He obviously has the talent and certainly the right timing for it . Guess he better wants to be remembered as a ' serious ' actor and who can really blame him for that . The movie further more features Dennis Farina , Miguel Ferrer and Madeleine Stowe . The movie is filled with some great comedy moments . that mostly , again , work out due to the characters and actors of the movie . The movie has some guaranteed laughs and make this a perfect typical ' no worries ' movie . Just sit back and enjoy watching it ! It also shows that John Badham is actually a fine genre director ! The timing is great and the pace , editing and positioning all make sure that the comedy in the movie works out even better . It's too bad that the story just mostly distracts from the movie and its humor . It's just not anything solid , interesting or something that hasn't been done before . But then again , this is all quite typical for the genre and time period it was made in . Basically if you enjoyed one or more of the ' Lethal Weapons ' movies , you'll surely enjoy this movie as well . Guess the movie could had impressed some more by putting in some more and bigger action . The movie now feels quite simple and cheaply made at times , which at times becomes distracting but overall doesn't take away any of the fun of the movie . Great entertainment !
485327	1416505	374526	8.0	Great piece of film making . Very stylish !	Don't expect a crappy little amateur film . " Batman : Dead End " puts some of the superhero movies made these days till shame . The style and atmosphere is even darker and more sinister then in the 2 Tim Burton Batman movies . You can say that " Batman : Dead End " is a more daring movie . The movie shows how the makers can handle several styles and it's the crew that really deserves credit . Everything works perfect especially the cinematography . But let's not forget the cast . Clark Bartram is actually a very convincing Batman ( Better then Val Kilmer and George Clooney anyway ) and Andrew Koenig is the perfect Joker his character is actually much more different then from the original movie in a good way . The character is more sinister and psychotic in a scary way instead of an entertaining . The characters are much more closer then the ones from the comic books . Sure the story is just beyond silly but that's not the point , the crew really showed how they can handle different moments and styles . This little film is filled with wonderful little moments and is a shear pleasure to watch . Awesome fights , great make-up , wonderful costumes , excellent directing , great cast , most excellent cinematography and a great and daring atmosphere and style , what is there not to like ?
484128	1416505	28691	8.0	A great adventure drama !	The movie has a great story about a rich spoiled brat who falls overboard on an ocean liner and gets picked up by a crew member of a fishing vessel . They can't take him back home immediately and he has to remain aboard the vessel for three months . The spoiled brat needs to adapt himself to the crew and hard life aboard the vessel , while the crew members in return also have a hard time exception the kid as one of them . But of course aboard the ship he learns far more than fishing . He learns about life and its values and about the ' real ' world . The movie has a dramatic story with several themes weaved in to it , such as most notably the father son relationship . It's however not a sappy over-the-top type of drama , as you would perhaps expect from a ' 30's movie . It's such a well layered story . It's even more interesting since its being told from the viewpoint of the young character . Quite unusual for a drama , especially for one made in 1937 , which makes this movie basically very good to watch for both adults as more younger people , even though it would be of course hard now days to interest them in an ' 30's movie . Despite being dramatic it also is above all really an adventurous movie to watch , especially for youngster of the same age as the movie its main character . It aren't really two genres that are commonly being mixed , which makes this an unique and great movie because of that reason already . The movie has a great cast . Of course the ' 30's were the golden age of child actors and Freddie Bartholomew is one of those great child actors of the ' 30's . Other and better known child actor Mickey Rooney also plays a role in this movie , although his role is actually quite small . Second main lead of the movie is being played by Spencer Tracy . If you didn't knew it was Spencer Tracy , you would had a hard time recognizing him in his role . I think this is also the foremost reason why he won an Oscar for his role in this movie . He completely becomes a different character , of Portugese heritage . The supporting cast is surprisingly filled with lots of big names such as Lionel Barrymore , Melvyn Douglas and John Carradine . All are well cast and play their parts great . The movie is importantly also a great looking one and most of the story is of course set aboard the boat . If there is one movie that could ever get you seasick it's this movie . The movie gives a good and realistic portrayal of life on the open sea . And despite the fact that the movie is mostly set aboard a boat , it isn't a movie that ever bores and there is always something happening in this movie , mostly thanks to its characters and actors that are portraying them . It might very well be the best adventure drama you will ever see !
485399	1416505	36910	8.0	A movie not without its weaknesses but still a more than great first go from Laurence Olivier on Shakespeare , on the silver screen .	No doubt Laurence Olivier must have been real proud of this project . It's really ' his ' movie , since he directed , produced as well as played the main lead . It actually earned him a special Honary Award during that year's Academy Awards ' for his outstanding achievement as actor , producer and director in bringing ' Henry V ' to the screen ' . It's a real Shakespeare movie , so expect lots of stagy looking settings and long dialog . Laurence Olivier however knows to bring it in a good and original way and actually manages to use it's ' stagy ' elements to the movie its own advantage . As an historical movie , concerning mostly the battle of Agincourt , I don't feel the movie is being completely accurate . The movie is a bit too patriotic by purely picking the British side , by showing how noble and brave they all were . It's presented as if Henry V willingly and fully knowingly walked into about , against a much bigger French force . Reason why the British won the battle of Agincourt was because of the supremacy of their longbows and the fact that the French completely underestimated them and made some tactical blunders during the battle . I don't really see much of that back in this movie . Also some of the cruelties being committed by the British and the mistakes they made during the campaign are simply not shown or mentioned in the movie really . The movie actually got financed by the British government , thinking that it would be a good moral boost for the English citizens and those fighting abroad , during WW II . So Shakespeare used as propaganda , how odd is that ? This is not really something uncommon by the way . ' Old ' movies often were very black & white with its themes . So good was being entirely good and bad totally bad . It's also not really something that troubled me too much but by todays standards its too simple and too outdated for the present movie norms . Also for a movie about the ' chronicle history of King Henry V ' the story focuses surprisingly little on the aspects of Henry V's life before and also certainly after the battle of Agincourt . The story ends at the peak of his life . But of course thing to blame for that is the movie its source , William Shakespeare's play , from 1600 . It's pretty nice that this is a 1944 movie that got shot entirely in color ( also much have been one of the reasons for its high budget though ) . It's actually the first ever Shakespeare movie to be made entirely in color . Still I feel that it would had suited the movie and its story better if it had been done in black & white . It would had suited the acting performances and the historical settings and characters all better . It's not like I hated this movie , of course not - far from it , but I don't want to sound all praising about it either . It's a good movie that however is not without its flaws and perhaps would had been a better one had it been made a decade earlier , at the time Laurence Olivier was playing the character on stage already . So not during WW II and not in color . But there is simply no denying it that this is such a well made and handled movie . Olivier did well and came to some creative solutions but by staying as much to the original source as possible , despite its undeniable WW II influences . The movie is perhaps at its best during the famous battle but also its dialog provide the movie with some real fireworks . A Shakespeare movie of course always has some amazing and often memorable dialog , especially when it remains so faithful to its source as this movie did . It of course also helps that the lines are being delivered by some real fine and capable actors . Laurence Olivier was an actor that simply lived and breathed Shakespeare throughout his career . A must-see for the fans of Shakespeare .
484885	1416505	177707	8.0	The first ever , still existing , attempt to put sound to moving images .	This is a pretty interesting experiment to watch . It's the first ever , still existing attempt , to unite sight with sound . It features two men dancing to a violin player ( possibly William K . L . Dickson himself ) , who is standing next to an Edison recording cylinder , that is capturing the sound . The sound and images were not linked together as one yet . And it wasn't until recently that the sound and image have been added technically together . It's probably the reason why people hesitate to call this movie the first ever sound picture . The movie is made by William K . L . Dickson , a assistant to Thomas Edison himself who ordered him to come up with a way to unite pictures and sound . The answer he provided was the Kinetophone , a Kinetoscope ( basicly a large wooden box with a peephole in it , so people could watch the moving images ) with a cylinder phonograph inside of it , for the sound . This is the first , that we know off , surviving movie-experiments that feature this technique . All of the later movies using this same technique were shot as silent movies and sound effects were recorded later and separately . So the Kinephone was not an attempt to synchronize sound and images but more an attempt to have images accompanied by sound . In some cases , people could even choose from three sound cylinders , featuring 3 different orchestral performances to accompany the images . Only 45 Kinetophones were ever made so you could hardly call the Kinephone a success . Also after this experiment , focus went off to other cinema techniques , mainly regarding movie-projectors . So the experiment itself obviously did not become a success , also since it took over 30 more years before the first movies with sound were made and commercially released . They just couldn't yet technically synchronize and put the sound and the images together yet at the time and even if they could and techniques would had been available , it would had been a very expensive job to do so . It therefor really isn't the most influential or historically important movies out of cinematic history but it's very interesting to watch , how people constantly tried to improve the quality and techniques of early cinema and movie-making .
485492	1416505	89927	8.0	Uhmm , for some reason I love it . . .	Yes , I'm very ashamed of myself but I can't help it that for some reason I really love this movie . Maybe it is because I often have a weak spot for over the top moments . The Rocky series of course is filled with some extremely over the top moments and " Rocky IV " really is no exception . Actually the movie also works as a good history lesson on the cold war subject . I actually had to watch this movie in history class years ago when the subject cold war was treated . It shows how the relationship between the USA and the USSR was at the time and what were the prejudices at the time , for instance that all Russian athletes used drugs and steroidsOf course the story is extremely predictable and you know exactly how it is going to end and that whole thing with that strange robot . . . well that was just weird . But like in all Rocky movies is the case , it really are the boxing and training sequences that make the movies worth watching . It should get your adrenaline flowing even though you of course know who is going to win in the end . Rocky I & II had Apollo Creed , " Rocky III " had Mr . T as Clubber Lang and " Rocky IV " has Dolph Lundgren as the opponent , who is a very stereotype strong Russian bear . I love it ! This might easily be Dolph Lundgren's best movie . Say what you want but I just love this movie .
484300	1416505	75866	8.0	A wonderfully rich entry .	The movie has a great written genre story . It features all of the usual Columbo ingredients ; The way Lt . Columbo approaches and bonds to his suspect , the way the mystery unravels for him , Columbo's dog , the cat and mouse play , which is great in this one and luckily as well some good relieving humor , mostly involving the Columbo character . It's all written despite the fact that it doesn't even have a truly original concept . Columbo hunting down a detective / murder novel writer had been done more than once before in a Columbo movie . It's also an extremely well directed movie from James Frawley , who after this directed 5 more Columbo movies , in the ' 70's and ' 80's . He provided the movie with style and some truly great and memorable sequences . It's one of the slower moving Columbo movies , despite not having a too long running time . This style and approach doesn't always work out well for a Columbo movie but in this movie it does , which is perhaps not in the least thanks to the acting performances of the movie . Most Columbo movie either starred a big well known star or a star from the early days of film-making , as the movie its murderer . This movie stars the rather unknown 81 year old Ruth Gordon . She didn't starred in an awful lot of movies throughout her career but she is still well known to some , mostly for her role in " Rosemary's Baby " , which also won her an Oscar . She had a realistic and somewhat unusual style of acting , which some people might not like though . It earned her 4 more Oscar nominations throughout her career , prior to her win for " Rosemary's Baby " , in 1969 . She has some great interaction as well with Peter Falk in their sequences together . The movie also stars a still young G . D . Spradlin . I say young because I only know him from his latest productions out of his career , despite the fact that he already was 57 at the time of this Columbo production . He is still alive but retired from acting , ever since 1999 . An even better than usual Columbo movie entry .
483824	1416505	37055	8.0	A great genre movie !	The movie is made in the same trend as " Citizen Kane " and the movie and its story and storytelling were obviously inspired by the success and greatness of the movie . This movie its main character is also featured ( almost ) entirely just in flashback , when an intrigued detective-story writer ( Peter Lorre ) ventures himself into a search of who the notorious criminal Dimitrios Makropolous ( Zachary Scott in his first movie role ) ' was ' , by interviewing people he met and had business with . It's a perfect treatment for the main character , who takes mysterious and grand proportions as a cold-hearted ruthless criminal , who isn't afraid to kill and use people to complete his assignment . He is a great early movie villain , who is unpredictable , slick , smart and therefor an interesting person to follow . Though it's debatable whether it aren't Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet who are the real main characters of the movie . Their search and the story of Dimitrios Makropoulos are two separate stories in the movie , who yet feel as one . It therefor is perhaps most fair to say that the 3 of them are the main characters of the movie . Zachary Scott plays he role effectively , though his performance will probably by todays standards be considered as formulaic and perhaps stiff . Peter Lorre is totally great in his role and he again is acting a lot with his body and especially his eyes . He plays a real great character , who is far from a hero or brave , which at the same time makes him very humane and therefor understandable and easy to relate with . Sydney Greenstreet is also totally great in his role . Greenstreet didn't played in an awful lot of movies during his career but when he did , his roles were always something special . He also appeared in many other classic movies from the ' 40's such as " The Maltese Falcon " , " They Died with Their Boots On " , " Casablanca " , " Christmas in Connecticut " and the list goes on . Also fun to see how he almost always played the same sort of character . But why shouldn't he , he was absolute great at it , in basically every movie he appeared in . The movie its style can be described as film-noir , set in a mysterious and more entertaining-light environment . The movie is not as heavy and serious as some of its other genre movies , which is perhaps also a reason why this movie isn't as well known as some of its fellow genre movies from the same time period . The atmosphere , camera-work and settings work moody for the movie , which provides this movie with a typical and unbeatable ' 40's flavor . A movie really worth seeing , with a great memorable and suiting finale .
485125	1416505	13086	9.0	The manipulative Dr . Mabuse .	This is the movie that features one of fist arch-criminals , Dr . Mabuse . A manipulative character , who by hypnosis manipulates people and set them up against each other and steal their money , by letting him play card games against him , while he lets his opponents deliberately loose , even when they have the better cards . He manipulates for more money and the love from respectable woman but also most definitely purely for his own pleasure . It doesn't need to be explained why Dr . Mabuse is evil , he just simply IS . That is what makes a great and memorable movie villain . Definitely true that the second halve of the movie is better than the first . In the second halve the movie really starts to take pace and form . Does it make the first part obsolete ? I think not . It perfectly shows how manipulative Dr . Mabuse and the characters also get strongly developed in it . But yes , it's definitely true that the movie is a long sit . Almost 4 hours is of course a long time ( and there even is a longer version ) . It does not ever make the movie bad or boring but it does make it a bit tiresome at times . The movie also isn't easy to follow but that often is the curse of early narrative full-length movies from the ' 10's and ' 20's of the previous century . For 60 % of the movie , the movie concentrates on card games . Some of the sequence involving the games are made to look more exciting and and tense than in any James Bond movie ever had been the case . The movie uses some good early cinematic ticks and also some interesting storytelling techniques such as some interesting fast flashbacks , to help to remind to the viewer of what happened earlier in the story . The movie also shows some early film-noir tendencies and other thriller and mystery elements . Not just with its story , psychological thriller elements or style of film-making but also with its characters . The main villain Dr . Mabuse is of course the best example of this . He plays an early full-blooded big movie villain , who is also being accompanied by a couple of typical crook-like looking henchmen . All elements that later would become defining for the genre . The movie is about good versus evil , in good early cinematic form . Some of the tricks make sure that the movie is filled with a couple of memorable and effective sequences , mainly regarding the manipulative hypnosis sequences , by Dr . Mabuse . It makes the movie highly imaginative and original , though it all obviously is not as revolutionary as the other Fritz Lang classics ; " Metropolis " and " M " . Of course by todays standards the acting in the movie is definitely over-the-top . Fritz Lang never casted actors just because of their acting skills but also because of their powerful looks . It all helps to make the early acting in Lang movies still fascinating and powerful to watch . Bernhard Goetzke as the state attorney von Welk is a great ' main-hero ' for the movie . Of course Rudolf Klein-Rogge is also great as Dr . Mabuse and so is Alfred Abel , though I liked him in " Metropolis " even better . Definitely worth seeing , if you can handle its long running time .
485571	1416505	21739	9.0	A story of all times .	This 1931 Jean Renoir French movie has a story of all times . It's about a man who falls for the wrong girl and gets deeper and deeper into problems because of it . What can be more lethal than a woman ? The drama is complex and multiple layered and mostly works out so well in this movie since the story by no means is a standard formulaic one . The movie does a very good job at remaining an unpredictable one throughout its entire running time and you just never know how the movie is going to end or in which direction its heading to . Jean Renoir was one the greatest early French movie directors from the 20th century . With this movie he makes his first ' talkie ' . It's notable in parts that this was still all fairly new and all for him and there are some small clumsiness's . He fairly much keeps the same style as movie-making he used for his earlier silent productions . This is mostly notable with the compositions within this movie . Not that this is a bad thing in my opinion . It gives the movie a great look and style that also seems really fitting for this particular movie and its story . It's a great looking movie with high production values . The camera-work is just great and the movie in parts also uses some great editing , that shows a scene from different camera angles . It doesn't do this throughout the entire movie though , since like I said before , the movie mostly keeps is made silent-movie style . Perhaps it was an early sign of things that yet had to come for Jean Renoir , when he in 1937 with " La Grande illusion " , that used lots of deep focus and camera-movements , something that also heavily inspired Orson Welles , among others , which is also really notable in " Citizen Kane " of course . Michel Simon gives away one fine performance as the movie its main character but the rest of the actors in acting within this movie is perhaps a bit uneven . But perhaps this also had to do with the fact that this was Jean Renoir's first sound movie and he had to become yet accustomed to working with dialogs and actors performing them . Unfortunately the movie uses some of its speed toward the ending but the movie at all times remains interesting and compelling enough to make you keep watching and just loving this movie right till the very end . A great first sound movie from Jean Renoir .
484268	1416505	21755	9.0	Great consistent Laurel & Hardy comical short .	Tiny problem with most Laurel & Hardy movies is that most of them have some weaker scene's and moments in them . " Come Clean " however is a wonderful exception to this and it's a movie that manages to stay consistent throughout its entire running time . All of the sequences are very well constructed and are highly amusing . Also some of the slapstick moments are not original but certainly entertaining . The movie also has some great comical spoken lines , which mainly involves Stan Laurel . Also Mae Busch shows her comical talent and her character gets the boys into some serious hilarious trouble . Mae Busch appeared also in several other comical Laurel & Hardy short's such as " Them Thar Hills " , " Oliver the Eighth " and " Unaccustomed As We Are " . One of the better Laurel & Hardy comical short's .
485164	1416505	240772	9.0	Great cast and script !	" Ocean's Eleven " is a very fun and stylish heist movies with a wonderful cast and clever script that provides more than enough surprises and fun twists . The movie is just mainly fun as it is meant to be , it is no Oscar material or anything . I think Steven Soderbergh ( who also wrote and did the cinematography for this movie ) really used his big name to get together such a great cast with big names such as : George Clooney , Matt Damon , Brad Pitt , Julia Roberts , Elliott Gould and Andy Garcia . All of the actors portray some fun and enjoyable characters . Characters such as Yen , Virgil and Turk Malloy and Basher Tarr , which are the most enjoyable . If you liked " The Italian Job " ( 2003 ) you'll love " Ocean's Eleven " . Hopefully " Ocean's Twelve " will be just as good , or maybe even better .
485176	1416505	74119	9.0	How the domino's fell .	If you want to know all about the Watergate scandal but you're too lazy to read a book or watch a documentary , like 80 % of the world's population , this movie is the ultimate resource to learn all about Watergate . The movie now has a perfect educational value now days , though at the time when it was made , the movie was made for different motivations , since it was all still quite fresh back then . The movie is of course the ultimate example of the power of the press but the movie is also most definitely about the power of politics . The story of the two reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein begins quite innocent but the further they dig into the story the deeper and higher they get , when they learn who are all involved in the cover-up , which of course eventually even leaded to the resignation of president Nixon . They are being triggered by the vague and contradicting comments people they call and meet make . They smell something big and they completely set their teeth in the investigation and their attempts to find sources and let people get on the record , with of course the mysterious Deep Throat as their most famous and highest ranking source , though this didn't get revealed until the time that deputy director of the FBI Mark Felt in 2005 revealed that he was the source they called Deep Throat , which before that remained one of the biggest journalistic - and modern history in general mystery . The story even becomes detective-like , when they step-by-step investigate to get the next piece of the puzzle , so they can get further with their journalistic investigation to uncover who are all involved and how high it actually goes . So in essence the movie often repeats itself with its events but yet manages to remain absolutely compelling and even exciting , due to the way of lively directing and also thanks to the fine acting from the many great actors that are in the movie . It's a political movie , meaning that it features lots of talking , names and difficult words . Yet the movie always remains perfectly good to follow , which is I think mainly due to the compelling storytelling of the movie . You can thank director Alan J . Pakula and writer William Goldman for that . And I'm not even a Alan J . Pakula but this movie is just one great and relevant classic . But also the fine acting definitely helps and gets the movie some extra flair . Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely great together as journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein . They are totally different characters with different backgrounds and ideals but yet they form a perfect investigating team . Jason Robards also plays a great role ( Oscar win ) and so does Jane Alexander ( Oscar nomination ) , who's role isn't the biggest but still a very relevant one and Hal Holbrook is still the ultimate Deep Throat . I especially love how authentic the acting in the movie felt . The actors obviously messed up their lines at times , which forced them to correct themselves . I just love how they decided to keep it in the movie , to give it all a more authentic feeling . The entire movie feels authentic , also since it tells the story purely from the point of view of the two reporters . It of course also totally fits within the realistic ' 70's style of film-making . The movie felt with many long sequence's and uses authentic lighting and make-up . The movie easily could had been 3 hours long but instead the movie is a more acceptable 138 minutes long . The final sequence of the movie perfectly shows , in just one minute time , how all the domino's fell after the published story . A really great and creative sequence and ending in my opinion . The ultimate educational movie about the Watergate scandal and an example and inspiration for great journalism .
484780	1416505	87544	9.0	A magnificent imaginative movie .	This movie has an absolutely magnificent imaginative story . The movie perfectly creates an unique post-apocalyptic world with some wonderful settings and strong characters . The movie is filled with some wonderful and certainly unique moments . Really the best element of the movie is truly the story . I have to admit that in the beginning I wasn't exactly grabbed or fascinated by the movie its story , characters and settings . However as the movie progressed I got more and more drawn into the movie and its story and characters and the unique world the movie was set in . The second halve of the movie , when the real action begins and the story takes more form , is especially extremely good . There are some fine action - and tense moments in the movie and the ending is build up very well and is truly both spectacular and adventurous to watch . Kudos to Hayao Miyazaki ! There are some really good characters in this movie . Princes Nausicaä is a strong heroic female lead and the movie features some good sidekicks , such as characters that provide comical moments , the wise man Yupa , who in several ways resembles Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings and of course the villains who are often so important in movies like this one . It are all very stereotypical characters who work very well for the movie its story . The characters are build up nicely and because of that they work really well for the movie . The movie is an beautiful unique and wonderful experience to watch . It's spectacular , imaginative , powerful and beautiful all at the same time . It's truly something you have to experience for yourself ! It's no surprise that I can whole-heartedly recommend this movie to everyone . You don't have to be into anime movies , to be able to appreciate and enjoy this movie . Be sure the watch the original Japanese , 116 minutes version of the movie though , for the most optimal movie experience .
483942	1416505	140352	9.0	The price of being honest .	This movie tells the intriguing story of mainly two normal individuals and their struggle to unveil the truth behind the lies of the tobacco industry , to the world . Michael Mann movies are often told slowly but they are never boring . This is due to the intensity it is told with , the realistic cinematography by Dante Spinotti and the editing by three different editors . On top of that the two main actors constantly keep the movie in motion . Russell Crowe and Al Pacino are both outstanding actors and are truly dynamite in this movie . Both are acting so powerful that they take the movie to an even higher level . Another fine ' villainish ' role is played by Michael Gambon and lets please also not forget the wonderful Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace . The way of story telling makes the movie intense and tense at the same time . Only a director like Michael Mann could pull this of . It makes " The Insider " truly one of the greatest and most powerful movie of the last couple of years . In my view the movie can be split in two different parts . The first part is about Jeffrey Wigand , his family and the pressure he is put under while the second halve of the picture mainly focuses on Lowell Bergman and his struggle to get the taped interview with Wigand aired on television . The balance between these two parts is perhaps not always perfect and the movie at times focuses a bit too much on Wigand and his family . I know that it is important for the story and the character of Wigand to also tell the story of his family but I felt that at times it took away some of the continuity and pace . The movie works well and shows what the price of just wanting to be honest in a corrupt world can be . A both important and powerful movie .
484373	1416505	96061	9.0	Fun to watch every day of the year .	This is a Christmas movie that also is very enjoyable to watch outside of the holiday's . Another name for the movie could be " The Bill Murray Show " , he simply makes this movie and I can't even imaging how the movie would have been without him in it . He's amazingly funny and on top of that he also is a wonderful actor . You can see that in some of the scene's he improvised a lot and he did that brilliantly ! All the other actors and characters are merely sidekicks . The story is basically a modern version of the classic Dickens novel " A Christmas Carol " and it's done wonderfully . It's great to see how the the classic story is translated into the 20th century . Everything works very well : The settings , the characters and the events , everything . From the hilarious opening involving Santa Claus and Lee Mayors ( I say no more ) till the wonderful ending the movie delivers non stop fun and pure entertainment with a nice love story , brilliant dialog and a great and important message in it . Only thing is that I feel that the movie could have done without the whole Loudermilk thing , but oh well . . . Very recommendable and close of being perfect .
484714	1416505	12364	9.0	Death comes to town .	Not as well known as the English , American , German and French cinema , though cinema from Sweden from the ' 20's was also quite good , interesting and revolutionary . This is a movie that is made great by its story . The story is told in ' A Christmas Carol ' kind of way , in which the death himself confronts the deceased with his past , present and what could have been . It's of course a story that concentrates on morals and it does this very well . The message comes across as very powerful and effective . This is of course also definitely due to the effective directing from the father of Swedish cinema ; Victor Sjöström . The story is based on the novel by other Swedish author Selma Lagerlöf . The story is adapted by Victor Sjöström himself , who perhaps should had taken out a few more elements , to let the story and movie flow better . It perhaps takes a bit too long before the movie starts to take form and the story gets clear but when the movie does take form and pace it becomes a really wonderful one . The movie does not only have a great story , it also is a good looking one . The movie uses some early and effective effects and uses some different color filters to create the right mood and to indicate what it past , present and ' future ' . Sjöström did not only wrote and directed this movie , he also plays the main character . Of course the acting in the movie is over-the-top at times , by todays standards but not as bad as in for instance early German movies was the case . And after all , this movie is more about its story and morals than it is about the acting , so it really doesn't matter much , or distracts . A really great and effective underrated silent-movie classic from Sweden .
485240	1416505	884328	9.0	An original movie that works on many dimensions .	This movie is being praised basically everywhere , which made me all the more skeptic about watching it of course . I mean , how could a movie set in a supermarket , surrounded by fog , could ever be an exciting or tense horror flick ? Well , you better believe it that this movie is a exciting and tense one to watch and it's all being presented in a very original way as well . The fact that the movie is directed by Frank Darabont should had already given away that this is a great movie . Darabont made the 2 successful Stephen King adaptations " The Shawshank Redemption " and " The Green Mile " prior to this movie . Suddenly I am also less worried about Darabont making a " Fahrenheit 451 " remake , which is in the works . " The Mist " is his third movie based on a Stephen King story and it's the first horror based one . Now , I never have been a too big King for but his story for " The Mist " seems like a genuine well written one because it's an horror movie in an unexpected way . What makes " The Mist " such a great and already almost classic movie is because of its approach . What " The Mist " does very well is that perhaps the biggest danger and horror doesn't come from outside , in the mist but from inside the people in the supermarket . This movie is a perfect study of human nature and it's not afraid to show the dark side of mankind . It's an highly original and approach of an horror story . Finally a real clever made horror movie , that also makes you think . This however all doesn't mean that the movie also isn't effective on its more generic horror elements , such as scare moments and ' monsters ' . Also on that level the movie knows to impress and is it just as effective . It chooses a realistic approach of things and therefore also picks a realistic visual approach , with sort of hand held looking quick shots and by showing things only from the perspective of the main characters . It throws you right in the middle of things , which of course also really adds to the overall effectiveness and power of the movie . In that regard the movie is also truly original . Because the movie tries to remain as realistic and ' small ' as possible , the movie also doesn't a cast with big selling names in it . Because of this , you also don't know who will survive in the end . Normally you know this already when a movie has some big famous names in it . It keeps the characters all more real . It makes the story totally not predictable and far from just another generic piece of horror . The movie also really doesn't end in a generic kind of way . The movie also features some good looking special effects . Normally special effects and horror are a bad combination but in this case the movie truly benefits from its special effects . There are all , again , featured in a realistic and they are obviously not put into the movie to impress its viewers but to help to tell the movie its story . Yes , the movie is really as good as everyone makes you believe it is !
485278	1416505	20979	9.0	One of the most typical Laurel & Hardy shorts .	This movie shows what Laurel & Hardy shorts are all about . Crazy situations , silly antics and some crazy stunts . This short is truly one of the best from Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy . The story is very simple and basically only serves as a lame excuse to make the boys do some crazy things and to get them into some ( unlikely ) silly situations . The movie becomes absolutely hilarious due to its simpleness . The comical slapstick situations are top-class and absolutely hilarious to watch . The movie is fast paced which makes this movie an almost non-stop constantly laugh filled one . The situations and troubles the two boys get into this time are highly original . The movie and its story might be simple but its comical situations are not . They are well build up , executed and timed . This is what Laurel & Hardy is all about ! One of their best and most typical shorts . An absolute must-see !
485432	1416505	448134	9.0	Finally a clever science-fiction movie again that works .	There have been some ( unsuccesful ) attempts the past few years ( such as " Solaris " and " Mission to Mars " . ) but lets face it , science-fiction movies now days mostly means flying space ships constantly battling each other and freaky looking aliens who try to take over the world , instead of the deeper and more philosophical approach . Nothing wrong with that sort of entertainment but it's refreshing to see that still good and clever science-fiction movies can be made , combined with the techniques of this decade . It really makes " Sunshine " one of the best science-fiction movies since years and I was pleasantly surprised by it . The movie features basically every cliché you can think of with this genre and it of course also makes the movie in parts predictable but it does a good job with combining it all and it works out really well thanks to the lively and original directing from Danny Boyle that is somewhere between spectacular and philosophical but always in its own style . The movie is a great blend between tense and spectacular action and clever written moments . This movie picks all kind of approaches from mystery , to tension , to action and it all works out effectively . Basically this movie has everything in it it needs to make a great movie with . It's tense , spectacular looking , has a mysterious theme in it and a sniff of romance . In other words ; all the ingredients to have a great time with . It's a movie that entertains and thrills and is a feast for all your senses . The movie is incredible good looking . Outer space has never looked so impressive and huge before . The visual effects are amazing and in a way also are the core of the movie . The special effects are everywhere , the establishing shots , the spectacular moments , the beautiful moments . They are just basically always present and a reason why this movie works out so well is because of its visual look , in which the special effects play such an important part . It of course can be all best experienced on the big screen . Has there ever been a movie before in which the sun played such a prominent role ? It almost becomes a character in the movie and it of course plays the biggest part in the movie , since it's all about the sun . In fact the story isn't really that much special or even original but the approach of it all makes this movie a refreshing one nevertheless , that is a great one to experience . How much things can you actually come up with , with a group of astronauts aboard a space ship on mission to re-ignite the dying sun . The movie comes up with some really well thought out and executed moments , that really are some edge-of-your-seat stuff at times . It's a greatly layered movie with themes in that can be interpreted in many different deeper ways , though it's also true that the movie toward the end becomes more formulaic and picks the more simplistic approach . And yes , it's definitely true that the movie is not terribly original with its themes and characters but nevertheless the execution and especially the visual look of it all still makes this movie one that is worth seeing , even if you've already seen all of the science-fiction movies this movie obviously was inspired by ( such as " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " and " Alien " . ) . The movie really isn't the most original one but yet it feels like a totally new experience . What I also love about the movie is that it does a good job at not picking one main character but instead focus evenly on all the characters aboard the space ship , even though you can say that Cillian Murphy plays the main character of the movie . It gives everyone a lot of screen time and doesn't really make any of them a secondary character for in the background with meaningless lines . It also makes all of the characters well developed , despite the fact that they all are quite formulaic . Also a reason why their characters work out is because of the top-class acting , from some well known but also lesser known actors . Not one actor in the movie disappoints and they all did a great job . It shows that Danny Boyle is a real actor-directing but also a director who knows how to tell a story without the actors but with lots of style and flair . A great , mysterious , tense , spectacular but above all also really well made beautiful movie experience that you really have to experience for your self .
484926	1416505	36775	9.0	One fine constructed movie .	This is a classic movie that is made by its story . It has a great deep murder-plot , with normal characters being put in not so normal circumstances . Within its genre this is simply one fine movie , that with all of its ingredients embodies the crime / film-noir genre of the ' 40's . Like all of these movies it begins all rather simple , with a good thought out murder-plot but of course soon things start to go from bad to worse . This is what I like mostly about this type of movies . Characterers change throughout the movie and the plot thickens fast . It's really a movie that gets better by the minute and besides also features plenty of nice twists and developments . A real fine constructed movie . It's of course also being made great by it's atmosphere , that I don't consider typically film-noir like , cinematography and directing by Billy Wilder , who handled a lot of different genres successfully throughout his career , film-noir being just one of them . He also helped to write the screenplay for this movie . His directing and writing both earned him an Oscar nomination for this movie . The movie got nominated for a total of 7 Oscar's , including best picture but it won none however . Nevertheless the movie has grown out to be more of a classic than the movies that did won an Oscar over " Double Indemnity " that year . Fred MacMurray isn't really the best known actor but he suits his role in this movie just fine . He really fits in well within the genre . I wasn't too happy about Barbara Stanwyck though , who has played far better roles throughout her career . She also looked quite ridicules with her blond wig . Ironically enough she still got nominated for an Oscar for her role in this movie . It was great to see Edward G . Robinson in this . It was the first time ever he appeared in a film-noir and prior to this he was mostly known for his tough roles in gangster-movies . A must-see for the fans of the genre .
484918	1416505	208092	9.0	Awesome movie .	This is top-class entertainment . The movie is brilliantly constructed and has its own unique style . Both the story and characters are over-the-top and therefor also extremely fun . This is a movie were basically is very little wrong with . It's some perfect mindless entertainment but with a complicated storyline . So it's still a sort of movie with a story , which you have to pay a lot of attention to , while watching . The movie is made in the same style as the previous Guy Ritchie movie , " Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels " . There are lots of similarities between these two movies , so if you liked " Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels " you'll most likely also really like this movie as well . Main difference with " Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels " though , is that this movie has a ' bigger ' cast with some more well known names in it . Jason Statham who made his debut in " Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels " plays the main character in this movie . Brad Pitt plays a very fun role and fits surprisingly well into the typical British storyline and atmosphere of the movie . Also well known actors like Benicio Del Toro and Dennis Farina fit in very well into the story and the movie in general . But perhaps the biggest positive surprise of the movie was Vinnie Jones . He had been given quite some dialog in this movie and he shows that he really can act . Most movies he plays in , he is given very little dialog , a shame because judging by just this movie , he is a very talented actor . Maybe the movie becomes a bit too complex at times , which is mainly due to the very many characters that play a prominent role in the story . It perhaps gets a bit too much at times but overall it doesn't make the movie any less fun to watch , just more ( too much ) complicated . The movie has some very fun and original moments in the story , even though the movie is a bit too similar to " Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels " at times . Which is also the main reason why I still regard " Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels " as a better movie . It came first and therefor it's more original and refreshing . Basically " Snatch . " is just more of the same . Not that more of the same is a bad thing in this case but it's just of course not as refreshing and original as with " Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels " was the case . If you like a well constructed movie with a solid and complex story told from multiple points of views this is a sort of movie that you'll love . Also highly recommendable if you liked " Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels " , of course . I don't mind seeing more movies like this being made .
484929	1416505	37101	9.0	A great movie within its genre , due to its solidly written story .	This is a real old fashioned film noir alright . No way a movie like this could be made - and work out as well now days . This movie is even more film noir-like than most genre movies I have seen . What makes this movie even more film-noir like than others is its story . It has an incredible amount of twists and turns in it . Characters reappear at unexpected moments , you don't know who to thrust and the story will leave you guessing to the end . The movie starts simple with a man who hires a private detective to find his wife but the plot starts to thicken more and more rapidly after that . Yes , it's a complicated story but its also such a fine written one that you can't help to be sucked in by it . It's quite atmospheric , though perhaps not as atmospheric as other genre movies . It's really more it's story than anything else that makes this movie such a classic film-noir . It also doesn't feature the best genre actors but the acting is still fine , mostly due to its simply wonderful dialog and script . Its tough dialog is typical for its genre and provides the movie with a really typical sense of style and atmosphere . A great movie within its genre .
484616	1416505	12532	10.0	The drama of two sisters in the midst of the French revolution .	Basiscly in essence this movie is a very original and pleasant take on the French revolution , when the monarchy got replaced by the republic . The story is told through the viewpoint of two sister , of which one is also blind , who get separated , during the events that lead up to the eventual French revolution and its aftermath . It's a great and original way to tell the story , without ever becoming too ' historical ' , with that I'm meaning that it doesn't turn into a dull history-class lesson . It's an amazing looking and crafted costume drama that above all is also really well told . Leave it up to D . W . Griffith to tell a grand epic story . Of course the movie is mostly melodramatic , like basically every other genre movie from the same time period . And melodramatic or not , the movie and its emotions work really well . It makes this a really effective movie to watch , though it's definitely not only just drama but the movie in its overall style is quite light ( especially compared to other D . W . Griffith movies ) and even leaves room for plenty of humor , despite it's heavy and dramatic undertone . D . W . Griffith movies have always contained humor , mostly of the small and subtle sort , that often worked refreshing from its more heavy and dramatic elements . This movie is no exception and even has a comical relief in it , in the form of Creighton Hale , as the servant Chevalier de Vaudrey . The movie actually features quite a lot slapstick humor , especially in its second halve . It proofs that D . W . Griffith had a great sense for timing . The movie is filled with many characters and also features many developing plot lines . The movie is however definitely not as tiresome and overlong as with other D . W . Griffith movies sometimes is the case . This movie knows to keep your interested because of its fantastic story and the well it's told and made to look in the eventual end movie . The movie is also not as hard to follow as with many other silent movies often is the case . I think this is also due to the more ' light ' way of storytelling . It's obvious that the movie makers wanted to entertain its viewers . The many characters are being played by some fine actors , although of course their performances are definitely over-the-top all by todays standards . The real life sisters Lillian and Dorothy Gish play also the two sisters in this movie , in their last movie role together . Lillian is of course the best known of the two , definitely thanks to D . W . Griffith's other movies but Dorothy in this movie shows that she is just as talented . The two also have a really great chemistry together on the screen which definitely helps the movie and its story . Joseph Schildkraut plays a great . pretty looking , noble and heroic character . But especially great in this movie are the ' villains ' . The movie has a wide variety of villainous characters , from many different classes . The aristocratic villains are great , mainly also because of their looks and style of acting but also the characters from the lower classes such as Jacques-Forget-Not and the vile Mother Frochard are great . All of the characters are really powerful and the movie manages to give each of them a defining personality . The movie gives a good and detailed look into the Parisian aristocratic lifestyle of the 18th century . It also perfectly explains how and why the French revolution occurred , without ever loosing its main focus on the dramatic story lines of the two sisters , who in essence don't really have anything to do with the revolution . They're just at the wrong place and the wrong time with the wrong people . The French revolution merely serves as a backdrop for the movie . The movie has a great look , with impressive looking sets and especially costumes . You can definitely describe this movie as a costume-drama in my opinion . There also are some great mass sequences and battles , all of course part of the D . W . Griffith trademark style of film-making . The race against the clock sort of ending is totally fantastic . It's tense and extremely well build up and executed . The eventual end of the movie is also really great , in which everything reach a satisfying conclusion . It suits the genre and especially this movie , really well . The movie left me with a great happy feeling and the overall movie made a big impression on me . Not even D . W . Griffith's best ( that really says something about his other movies ! ) but certainly his most pleasant to watch - and entertaining one .
484915	1416505	133093	10.0	The most influential and refreshing science-fiction movie since " Star Wars " .	" The Matrix " has redefined the science-fiction genre . Previous to this movie , most science-fiction movies consisted out of scene's in space with spacecrafts , aliens , all set in a futuristic world . Most movies that tried to be different from this , mostly failed . " The Matrix " does however does not fail and it redefined the science-fiction genre and has taken it to a whole different and more seriously taken level of movie-making . The movie has inspired many different movies ever since and showed that science-fiction and action elements are a great and spectacular combination . From that perspective " The Matrix " is one of the most important movies for film-making , from the ' 90's . This is a superb piece of movie-making . The Wachowski ' brothers ' were obviously inspired by the Japanese anime style and they transform that style spectacularly into a life-action movie . Because of the style and flair of the movie , it makes the action look spectacular and even also look as something totally new . The fantastic bullet-time effects were something unseen before and are already alone reason enough why this movie is already almost a classic and certainly unforgettable movie . The style and new effects used in the movie make this movie to be also a refreshing one . It's an extremely original movie , both story-wise and technique-wise . Especially the action is what truly makes this movie a success . The fight and action sequences are beautifully choreographed . It also all is beautifully shot by cinematographer Bill Pope , who uses some fantastic lighting and camera-angles at times . The musical score from Don Davis is also quite good . Also the costumes and settings most certainly do not disappoint . The special effects are spectacular and also something totally new at times . The cast is not the strongest element of the movie . Keanu Reeves is fairly good as the main character but he lacks some charisma at times . Some goes for Carrie-Anne Moss to be honest . Actors who do not disappoint are Laurence Fishburne , Joe Pantoliano and the fantastic Hugo Weaving in his real big breakthrough role . He is an excellent ' villain ' because of his look and way of acting . But what really makes and shapes the movie is its story . Yes , it's complex and believe , not everything makes sense or is explained in a satisfying way but it at least is something totally original and imaginative . The story really shapes the movie and its style and make the action and science-fiction elements of the movie work fantastically together . The movie is great non-stop spectacular action entertaining that doesn't even get slow or boring even when nothing is really happening . This is mainly due to the imaginative powerful story of the movie . If you don't understand and / or get the story the first time , just watch it a second or third time . The movie is worth it . The movie uses multiple layers , symbolism and elements from religions and other styles of movie-making . It makes you discover more new things , every time you watch the movie . One of the most original and influential movies from the ' 90's and therefor also an absolute must-see !
484937	1416505	117631	10.0	One of the great biopics .	" Shine " is one of the great movies of the ' 90's , that became an unexpected success in 1996 and was the movie that earned Geoffrey Rush his as of yet only Oscar win and got the movie 6 more Oscar nominations , including best director and best picture . The movie shows how Australian born David Helfgott gets formed and influenced in his early life by his demanding and abusive father ( wonderfuly played by Armin Mueller-Stahl ) , who is in strict control of the family . He asks a lot from the already very unstable David and influences ever step in his life , probably also to make up for his own shortcomings in life . He's an unpredictable character with two faces and you can really feel the fear he puts in the family and David in particular . Things go worse and worse mentally for David as he grows up and eventually goes to study in England at the Royal College of Music . He has a breakdown which for once and for all definitely labels him as a psychotic man . His personality could definitely been described as crazy . He gets perfectly and beautifully portrayed by Geoffrey Rush , who truly deserved the Oscar he received for his role . But in fact he is only in the movie for perhaps halve the running time . For " Shine " uses lots of flashbacks about Helfgott's early life and as a young adult , when he is being played by different actors . One of those actors is the know very well known Noah Taylor , who also plays the part fine . Also really impressive is Armin Mueller-Stahl . He doesn't usually have very big parts in English spoken movies but in this movie he plays one of his bigger and more interesting roles . It's a true memorable performance from him and he also truly deserved his Oscar nomination for this movie . I keep thinking it's a great shame he got discovered so late by the big-money movie industry , since he is already close to 80 by now , which should mean that his biggest and greatest roles should already be behind him by now . But who knows , some actors just go on forever , till a very old age . Take for instance John Gielgud , who also stars in this movie . At the time he was already well over 90 years old and he would continue to play on in many more great and big productions , till his death in 2000 . Some actors are just truly born as actors . It simply is in their blood and they can't stop playing . Moments in Helfgott's life are never portrayed too long but also never too short . This means that the story always comes right to the point and doesn't dance around it . The movie becomes very effective because of this and on top of that gets presented with a good steady pace . It's a reason why this movie is really one of the better autobiographic movies ever made . It's a really great directed and told movie , from Scott Hicks . But of course like every good biopic , the movie doesn't only presents facts and some things are altered , in order to enhance the movie and its story or characters . For instance right after this movie the real Helfgott became a true full God , while in all honesty David Helfgott is a great piano player but just not the genius one as portrayed in this movie . It's kind of like the piano man . The mysterious mute man who was found in Kent England in 2005 . It was said he was a brilliant piano player , while in fact he just simply knew how to play a piano well but was by no means a great or professional player . Just like David Helfgott , it are just the unusual circumstances and character personalities that makes people say they are geniuses , rather than it's an objective reflection of their actual qualities . But like I said , this isn't anything unusual to do for a biopic , to play around a little with the facts and it certainly is no objection when it actually enhances the movie . " Shine " truly benefits from its approach and story . I also enjoyed David Hirschfelder nice little musical score ( also Oscar-nominated ) . Of course the movie also benefits from it's classical compositions that are being featured . It's of course a very musical movie , since it's about the life of a musician but you really don't need a classic musical lover to enjoy or to appreciate this movie though . The movie ends quite abrupt and perhaps not satisfying enough but this is of course simply due to the fact that David Helfgot is still alive and active today . Who knows , perhaps they could had better waited for another 30 years to come up with a movie about his life , for who knows what more strange and beautiful moments his life shall know . Perhaps it's not the most stylish or greatest made movie but the combination of the interesting unique story , pace and main character ( and of course Geoffrey Rush his performance of him ) are what makes this movie such a basically flawless ( you simply just forgive the movie for its flaws and shortcomings while you're watching it ) and captivating one to watch .
484002	1416505	67116	10.0	The ultimate cop movie .	My favorite movie of all time " A Clockwork Orange " lost at the best picture Acadamy Award ceremony against this movie . However looking at this movie I can't say that it's undeserved , for " The French Connection " truly is one of the best movies from at least the seventies and maybe of all time . It most certainly is the best cop movie ever made , in my opinion ! The movie has a perfect gritty and realistic kind of atmosphere and an unmistakably seventies feeling . I love it ! The seventies truly were the golden age of film making and they simply don't make movies like this anymore . The characters are perfectly realistic and director William Friedkin and the actors most certainly don't attempt to portray them as being heroic or ' good cops ' . Gene Hackman really in a way is an anti-hero and he seems to be born to play ' Popeye ' Doyle , who by now truly has grown into a classic movie character . Roy Scheider also is really great as his partner ' Cloudy ' Russo , even though his character at times disappears too long out of the story . A shame because he and Hackman were a perfect screen duo . Both got an Oscar nomination but only Hackman got to take the statue home with him . The movie also won Oscar's for best director , best film editing , best picture and best writing , screenplay based on material from another medium and got nominated for three more . The movie might have a slow pace by today's standards but the wonderful story and acting really make up for this , " The French Connection " has stand the test of time well . The slow pace even makes the famous car chase scene even more energetic and thrilling enough to make your adrenaline run . Truly in my opinion , the ultimate cop movie !
483813	1416505	114369	10.0	Dark and disturbing thriller that will stay with you for ever .	Rarely there has been a movie with such a good dark and chilling atmosphere . I even see this movie more as an horror movie than as a thriller because of that . " Se7en " is unique in many ways . The movies mood is already set right from the beginning on . The movie starts dark , intense , chilling and mysterious , a mood that is present throughout the entire movie . It's very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the meaning of the word . The mood is set by good camera work and lighting , or better said , the lack of it . The music from acclaimed composer Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere . Unlike many other movies from the same genre , the movie is slow paced and takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some obvious cliche's . The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them such a great couple . Brad Pitt for once has the opportunity to play more than just the pretty boy and he does it with success . Kevin Spacey truly plays a bone chilling character , almost just as legendary and chilling as Hannibal Lecter . I would very much like to see the two of them put in the same room , just to see who would make it out alive . Further more it was great to see R . Lee Emrey again as the police captain . The movie is filled with some truly gross , sickening and horrifying scene's , this seriously ain't no kids stuff ! The movie has some of the most sickening murders I have ever seen featured in a movie . But it aren't just only the gross scene's that are good , there are also some scene's that are made with lot's of beauty and profession such as the library scene . Dark and chilling movie that you will never forget also thanks to the ending which I will not spoil for you . A real must see .
485512	1416505	13442	10.0	The mother of horror movies .	This movie was really impressive and quite an experience to see . Who would have ever known that a silent movie would still be so powerful now days . The power of the movie is in the fantastic atmosphere . The sets and environments are perfect and give the movie an unique atmosphere that actually is very creepy , even now days . It's also thanks to the cinematography that captured the images perfectly . One of the most atmospheric movies I have ever seen . The story is told in a great way and I must say that it's told better than any other Dracula movie later released . The movie is full with some classic horror scene's that later would inspire many other filmmakers . And yes the movie is actually scary , which is mainly thanks to Max Schreck who plays the part of Count Orlok in a most incredible way , also helped by some good make up . Most of the other performances are typically early movie stuff . Meaning that it's silly over the top at times . Gustav von Wangenheim gives a great lesson in overacting and his laugh might very well be the weirdest I have ever seen in a movie . But in a way all those performances give the movie a certain charm which makes it irresistible to watch . There are also some surprising good special effects . Better one's as in the 1931 version with Bela Lugosi anyway . Some of them were really impressive and I can imaging it really seriously freaked some people out back in 1922 . Truly a piece of movie history that needs to been seen by the movie lovers , especially by those who like the horror genre . Still after 82 years one of the best horror movies of all time .
485370	1416505	24852	10.0	Way more than just another Laurel & Hardy movie .	I expected just another Laurel & Hardy slapstick comedy but instead got something that surpassed all my expectations . The story is absolutely great ( based on the Glen MacDonough operetta ) and features many well known fairy tale characters . The entire movie is set in a cheerful and colorful ( atleast when you watch the colored-in version of the movie , released in the ' 90's of course . ) world where everyone lives their simple and happy life and spend most of the time singing cheerful sappy songs . It's truly a movie that's both over-the-top and terribly outdated but that now has become a part of its charm and makes this movie a totally great and absolutely irresistible one . All of the fairly tale like characters are absolutely great in the movie . Most of them don't really play a significant role but their presence alone is enough reason to give the movie a joyful feeling . Speaking of insignificant roles ; how about the boys ? Well , to be honest Laurel & Hardy don't really play a most significant role in the movie . They are mealy sidekicks in the story and even though they get to do some funny sequences , with some typical Laurel & Hardy humor , this movie is not really a slapstick or comedy . It's more a cheerful musical with some comical characters in it . It's difficult to see if the presence of Laurel & Hardy make this movie a better one or not . It isn't really a Laurel & Hardy movie and it has a totally different feel and atmosphere . Some of the fans will be delighted with their appearance in this movie , while others will perhaps be disappointed by it . What really drives the movie is the story and its characters . The movie has a very solid villain in it , perfectly portrayed by Henry Brandon . Brandon apparently only was in his 20's when he played the role , so also lots of credits have to go to the make-up and costume department , for making him look like a scary , old , ugly , almost Scrooge like villain . The story also really has some solid moments in it . The ending is surprisingly big and spectacular and features monster like creatures , versus an army of wooden soldiers ( in certain sequences created with some early stop-motion effects ) , build by our two boys . Even though the movie is mostly cheerful , it also knows how to build up its tension , with as a result some really well story-wise constructed moments that all work out extremely well . I'm going to say something very daring now but here goes ; In my opinion this movie is even better than " The Wizard of Oz " . Both movies are much alike in several different ways . Both movie are set in a cheerful imaginary world , with imaginary likable characters and a ruthless villain who spoils all the happiness in that same cheerful world . Let's face it , both of those movie are extremely old fashioned and outdated but the cheerful charm makes both of the movie irresistible ones , that still speak to the imagination . This movie is a real forgotten masterpiece and the movie deserves to be better known and seen by persons all over the world . Really a movie that I truly enjoyed watching .
