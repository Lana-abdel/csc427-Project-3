484895	1416505	60666	1.0	What was that ?	Never has a movie been so dumb , silly , bad , ugly , awful at the same time . Is " Manos , the Hands of Fate " really that bad as everyone says it is ? Yes , it is and maybe even worse . What makes " Manos , the Hands of Fate " a bad movie is that it was made with no talent or imagination , quite sad to watch really . I don't know what is the worst ; The acting , the script , the sets , the editing . The most likely answer is that it's all just simply plain bad . Especially the editing is the worst I have ever seen . Some scene's seem to be endless while nothing is shown at it at all and most of the time they don't even have anything to do with the movie . The movie is full with this long endless shots that are really about nothing , very boring to say the least . The story is just laughable bad , if you asked me what it is about I think I can not even explain it . It's just about nothing and lot's of it makes no sense at all . It feels like someone is poking you in the brains with a stick . The movie is full with silly moments that makes you think ; What the is that ? The actors are by far some of the worst ever . They show absolutely no talent or what so ever . Then we come to the only good thing about the movie : Torgo . Oh boy what a character ! I doubt it was intentional but this guy is absolutely hilarious with his strange ticks and movements . He alone makes this movie still watchable . He is a real classic . I also must admit that I liked the ending a lot . I even found it surprising and shocking but a good ending can't save a bad movie . Congratulations Hal Warren , you created one of the very worst movies of all time , you make an Ed Wood movie seem like a masterpiece . A must see for bad movie lovers .
484390	1416505	60457	2.0	And the Oscar for best original movie title goes to . . .	First of all , don't take this movie serious people . This way you'll enjoy it the most . It's a typical British goof-ball comedy , with mainly one big difference to it ; that this movie also stars icons Boris Karloff and Basil Rathbone , in one of their last movies . Yes of course their age really shows . Karloff was nearly 80 at the time of this production and Rathbone sounded as if he had last his denture . But of course their presence alone still adds some class to the movie and gives the movie as a whole a certain bit of extra . Besides them two the movie also features Nancy Sinatra , who hasn't appeared in a lot of movies in her lifetime . The movie features mainly very silly humor , that on top of it all also just isn't exactly very funny . It's however so clumsy and embarrassing to watch all that it also becomes sort of a cute harmless little movie , that becomes fun to watch due to this clumsy and amateur like film-making , the overall movie has . But the humor isn't the main issue of the movie . It's its story that makes this movie such a bad one to watch . Halve of the time I really don't know what is going on on screen , because it all is just so confusingly bad to follow . Who are all these characters and what do they want ? This is a perfect example of how not to make a movie . The movie gets all the more painful to watch as it heads toward its ending . The movie also features some very random musical numbers , with scary ' 60's dancing to it . One of the elements that makes this a quite odd movie to watch . An embarrassment to watch .
484229	1416505	109167	2.0	Seriously now . . .	This movie is " Epic Movie " , " Date Movie " and " Meet the Spartans " type of bad . It's just as lame with its humor , which means it's just totally not funny at all and instead is more annoying , in basically every way thinkable . Honestly this was one of the worst movies I've seen in my life and that says a lot . I could barely watch this movie , since it was so embarrassingly badly made . I've nothing against a stupid comedy but that doesn't mean it can just get away with bad writing , bad directing , bad acting and bad basically everything else . the National Lampoon's movies never have been known for its comical subtlety or overall brilliance but this movie is bad even for their normal standards . The movie is presented as a double feature , in which two different stories are told . Both feature the same actress as the main lead but are basically not connected in any way . The only thing that connects them , expect for the same main lead actress , is how incredibly bad they are . It's almost as if there was no script ready at the time of the shooting and the stories just never get off the ground , since they are just far from something interesting . They progress in a very childish way , as if it was made only for people with an incredibly low IQ score . How can you watch and honestly like a movie like this ? The movie tries to be funny in basically every scene , which is overkill . And on top of that , the movie obviously isn't that funny . It's comedy is oh so predictable and again incredibly lame and childish . If you let a 6 year come up with a comedy , he or she would probably come up with a movie like this . Seriously , I don't want to spend any more time now saying how bad , horrible and just almost completely unwatchable this movie is . I seriously can not understand how anyone could ever like and laugh out loud at this movie .
484817	1416505	55452	2.0	Ed Wood's last attempt at ' serieus ' movie making .	Dialog in Ed Wood movies are often among the worst you'll ever hear in any movie . It's tone cringing and hilariously bad at times . Especially also hilarious how Ed Wood tried to put in humor into this movie . Wood perhaps wasn't the worst director of all time but he might very well be the worst writer of all time . This movie its story is also really confusing to follow , since it just doesn't make much sense . It's a movie with many sub-plots , rather than one clear main plot and the movie focuses too much on too many different characters , rather than it has one clear and likable main character . The movie misses a Bela Lugosi , Tor Johnson or Vampira . But I have to hand Ed Wood one thing . Some of his movies handle for its time some sensitive and daring themes . He previously for instance did this before with his movie " Glenn or Glenda " , which was about transvestites and more or less also with his movie " Plan 9 From Outer Space " which had some social criticism in it . " The Sinister Urge " concentrates on the world of pornography . Of course not a subject that would often be handled ' seriously ' in ' 60's movies . Ironicaly enough Wood himself would land into the world of soft-core porn movie making after this film as a director , writer and ( unfortunatly also ) actor . It's especially since this movie tries to show how ' evil ' pornography is . It even turns people into serial killers . Especially the dialog explaining how evil it all is , is extremely moralistic and completely totally horrible . I actually also would suspect that the portrayal of the porn industry is far from the truth and how it was at the time . So it's also really doubtful that Ed Wood actually did some research for his movie . Continuety is a big problem and the editing often doesn't make a whole lot of sense . Character positions and even car models change suddenly in between different cuts . It's also quite hilarious that the movie at times recycles some of its sequence and of course Wood also uses some archive footage again , this time even from some of his previous movies , of which some got never completed . This movie might very well feature the worst editing out of all Ed Wood movie's . Ed Wood was basically also really an horrible actors director . The acting is extremely wooden and the actors obviously at times don't know how to act or move , probably because they themselves had a hard time understanding the script or what Wood wanted from them . Of course the budget was also obviously low again for Mr . Wood . This means that the movie is mostly being shot at location and inside small studios , with cardboard sets and hardly any dressing to it , expect for a desk , a phone and a map of the world . Ed Wood always had a hard time finding financiers for his movies . This movie was perhaps the last straw for him and the reason why he for a while quite film-making after this in , in order to pursuit a writing career , before venturing himself into the world of soft-core porn movie-making . Edward D . Wood Jr's last ' serious ' film-making attempt is consistent with the movies he did prior to this movie . So Mr . Wood ends in style with " The Sinister Urge " .
484609	1416505	60664	3.0	Waste of a great story .	I shall not pretend as if I have seen the 1928 version of this movie ( not yet anyway but I'm certainly planning to ) with Conrad Veidt in the main lead , or the original from 1921 , of which this movie is a remake but it's pretty safe to assume that those movies are better than this version . The movie is absolutely horribly made . The concept and setting are quite good and promising but it is all wasted with the weak storytelling of it all . The story itself , based on the book by Victor Hugo , is quite fascination , almost Shakesperean like . It has some great elements in it but it is all wasted in this movie . All of the potential is ruined but the weak acting , dreadful camera-work ( seriously , don't they know what a focus-puller is ? ) and horrible editing . The story is also told messy and at times you don't even know who exactly are supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys of the movie . It makes the movie very unpleasant and uneasy to watch at times . There are still some good moments in the movie , especially in the middle but overall the movie is a dragging , messy , confusing one that isn't really worth watching . The movie also becomes unnecessary ridicules at times , especially toward the ending of the movie . It truly becomes laughable bad at times and loses all of it's credibility because of those many moments , that are present in the movie . Great story , very bad storytelling and execution of it all .
484525	1416505	954541	3.0	Horrible tasteless movie .	I wonder how much this movie actually has got to do with the 1984 movie " Bachelor Party " , starring Tom Hanks . Is this movie even an official sequel ? This movie is lacking in every department and you're obviously better off not watching it . For a comedy this movie simply isn't good or funny enough . It relies mostly on the character's their stereotypical assessments , rather then the movie actually features some good , original and funny moments . Of course there also is very little story present and the movie nude breast than script pages . You just keep waiting for things to finally start off . There is a main plot line in it somewhere but that one is so terribly unoriginal and gets executed so poorly in the movie that it feels more as if it's something non-existent . I guess there even is a message and moral story in it somewhere but this again is so terribly unoriginal and poorly done in the movie that it simply does not work out . It's basically a typical teenage comedy , with lots of sex jokes and nudity , only without the teenage main characters , which makes the story all the more sad and tasteless . The movie makes some really wrong jokes , that are misplaced for any type of movie . I regret ever watching this .
484276	1416505	214529	3.0	Sophie Marceau has dropped down to this now days ?	The movie is apparently based on a popular French horror novel , by Arthur Bernède , from 1927 . Not that I had ever heard about it before but Belphégor has been a popular subject before for movies and mini-series . The first movie got released way back in 1927 , simultaneously with the novel . Arthur Bernède was a part of a group of writers who wrote and produced films and novels simultaneously . The character Belphégor is one of his best known creations . Once upon a time Sophie Marceau was a promising new European actress who would conquer Hollywood . She has now however dropped back again to movies like this one . Nothing wrong with playing in French quality movies , since it's the country she originates from but this movie is just ridicules . Problem is mostly that the movie relies on its special effects , to make the movie good and scary . Well , horror and special effects never really have been a good combination though , with some exceptions here and there . It's not like the special effects are bad in this one . Especially for an European movie it is simply good but it ; s just misplaced , since the movie gave the feeling it could had easily done without its effect . It would had actually made the movie a better and scarier one to watch , no doubt about that really . The movie is just not ever tense or engaging to watch , also since the movie seems to have difficulties picking the right approach . At times the movie picks a light and just less serious approach , while at others it clearly attempts to be a good scary horror movie . This is mostly the reason why the movie just doesn't work out on any level . You can say that the movie is even a bit boring . It all also definitely gets worse toward the ending . After a while you just stop caring about this movie and its story and you start wishing you had decided to watch something else instead . The editing seems totally off . It uses too fast cuts , without much style , while the fast editing was obviously intended to give the movie a good , modern style . Also the time-line is just plain messed up at times , as if some sequences got edited in the wrong order . The musical score is also really annoying and at times doesn't even sounds to fit the movie , as if it all long got scored before the movie finished shooting . I can't believe composer Bruno Coulais is an Oscar nominated composer . The musical score is almost just as annoying as the movie its sound effects . The movie is filled with many characters , which you however just couldn't care less about . It also just seems very unlikely that a woman like Sophie Marceau would ever fall for a man such as Frédéric Diefenthal . The movie also features Julie Christie , which is nice but just doesn't add much to the movie . A horrible watch .
485036	1416505	116654	3.0	What was that ? !	What exactly did I just watched here ? To be honest , the movie started of promising . It seemed to have some nice actors and character and above all the movie made SENSE . However the movie started to go down hill rapidly and I mean really down hill ! This movie is real wasted potential . The premise is good and interesting and good enough to raise some provoking issues . The actors are also good and so is the visual look of the whole movie ( with the exception of its early special effects ) , with its Stan Winston make-up effects , settings and cinematography . Yet somehow they messed everything up and all of its potential is wasted in this messy , confusing , weird cinematic piece of garbage . It sounds ironic but from the moment when Marlon Brando's character appears in the movie , the movie becomes all quirky , weird and extremely messy . The movie starts to become very unbelievable and toward the end also very far from understandable . Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer are of course great actors but in this movie also unintentional funny and not credible as persons who like to play God . The act like a bunch of idiots in this movie and they do some weird things , Marlon Brando especially , who also looks totally ridicules with weird make-up and odd clothes . In one sequence he even wears an ice bucket on his head ! Ice bucket helmet . . . I rest my case . I think that says enough about how this movie is like . The ice bucket sequences is iconic for the rest of the movie . He is also accompanied by a small dwarf like creature , who wears the same clothes and sits by his right side . It obviously formed the basis and inspiration for the character of Mini-Me in the Austin Power movies . It makes these sequences even more unintentional hilarious to watch . But yet it are still the well known actors who give the movie still some ' watchability level ' . David Thewlis was perhaps not the right choice for the main character , he isn't charismatic enough for that but nevertheless he's a great actor of course . Marlon Brando doesn't plays such a prominent role as you would expect . He actually appears quite ( too ) late into the story . Val Kilmer perhaps delivers the best performance of the movie , until the moment when his character goes crazy . The movie further more features well known actors such as Ron Perlman , Temuera Morrison and William Hootkins in unrecognizable roles . I wish that the movie made more sense . It would at least had made the movie more entertaining to watch . It instead now offers very little entertainment , even to the most objective and open viewers . The way the story is told makes it far from interesting , compelling or thought provoking . If I had to tell what the story is about , I would say ; about a bunch of weird like half human-animals who want to break free from their master and ' God ' , played by Marlon Brando . Everything else gets muddled into the messy story . It makes the movie look like a ridicules potential-less Z-movie from the ' 50's . Really not worth seeing . I only have one more thing to say , that should sum it all up ; Ice bucket !
484495	1416505	105396	4.0	Awfully simple comedy .	This movie is rather unknown ( only 85 vote on IMDb at the moment ) and it should stay unknown . The movie is very simple . It's very predictable and for a comedy it has very few laughs . Also the style itself is simple and about as average as it can be . The story is not really good and doesn't always flow or makes sense and is filled with some rather big plot-holes . Jeff Goldblum on the other hand is good and comically talented and so is Burt Kwouk's ( Cato from the " Pink Panther " series ) in his small but fun role . But quite frankly all of it is not good enough to save this movie . It is no disaster but it's not recommendable either .
483736	1416505	277027	4.0	Annoying , stupid , over-dramatized , bittersweet drama .	Sorry folks but this movie was just plain bad ! The story is incredibly over-dramatized and over-the-top sweet at times . For me this was a very annoying movie to watch . Even though Sean Penn is good in his role his character is far from a believable one . The way his characters acts and time and says some things makes his character totally unbelievable and perhaps a bit over-the-top at times . Really a horrible portrayal and perhaps at times even offensive portrayal of a mentally disabled person . There also is some totally misplaced humor in the movie with Sean Penn's character mentally disabled friends , which I found to be totally unnecessary . Thankfully there also still are some good character portrayals in the movie by Michelle Pfeiffer , Dakota Fanning , Dianne Wiest and Laura Dern . The movie doesn't only over-dramatize it also wants to be overly artistic at times . The camera-positions and style of editing are at times completely pointless . The camera-work in general is also too intense for a movie like this one . The intense camera-work by Elliot Davis worked for a kind of movie like " Thirteen " but is completely out of place in a drama movie like this one . I still like his style of lighting for this movie though . Another thing that annoyed me was the musical score by John Powell . The score was incredibly simple and had no beauty or what so ever in it . In fact it truly annoyed me at times and distracted from what was happening on the screen ( not that much interesting or new was happening on it though ) . The movie is way too bittersweet . The movie has some totally unbelievable and over-the-top sweet and moralistic moments in it . The movie its intentions were good but it simply tries too hard to be emotional and dramatic in almost every aspect . The ending was also totally lame and left an incredibly bad aftertaste and was completely unsatisfying . Why so many people fall for this annoying over-dramatized movie really puzzles me . With currently a 7 . 2 rating , this movie is terribly overrated here on IMDb . com .
485098	1416505	144715	4.0	Bad storytelling and lots of other things makes this one of the most pointless movies you'll perhaps ever see .	I tried to watch this movie once before in the past but honestly couldn't finish watching it and turned it off after about halve an hour . The story and story-telling was ridicules , the flow was just off and I didn't liked were the movie was heading to and it made me tired watching it , since it made such an absolutely pointless impression . The story is just bad since its hard to believe . Guess these sort of things really happen in the world but it just doesn't ever get believable in the movie , mostly because of the reason that it just never gets interesting . Which character are we supposed to sympathize for ? The Kate Winslet one ? I don't think so , since she plays a brainwashed , manipulative character , who turned her cheek to her family and ' normal ' way of life . The Harvey Keitel one then ? No , really not . He's a character that sleeps and slaps around and cheats on his wife . The editing is a reason why the movie just never flows and makes the movie feel incoherent . Also the cinematography makes some odd choices at times . To me some of the shots even seemed amateur like . Weird , since Dion Beebe is an one time Oscar winner - and nominee , so perhaps simply blame the director ? Further more the movie uses slow-motion at the oddest times , so that it becomes laughable , instead of effective . The movie gets all the more weird from the moment Harvey Keitel starts to wear a dress . How can you take anything else that's happening after that serious ? You can say that the comedy goes at the expense of the drama but this also is vice versa the case . Guess this movie will also be remembered as the one with Harvey Keitel walking in the Australian desert , with full make-up on and in a dress . All of the family characters are supposed to be humorous and a wild bunch of crazy people but their all so horribly stereotypical that this just never works out . All of the actors portraying them also seem to be non-actors , which could had worked for the realism but simply doesn't because of the reason that they were supposed to be comical . Some of the dialog and moments are supposed to be humorous but they all feel awkward . It's almost embarrassing to watch . The endless talking about nothing between the Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel also don't help to make this movie the most interesting or fast going movies . Just think about it , what gets achieved in this movie ? Absolutely nothing and therefor the movie is a totally pointless and redundant one . It tries to go deep but it seems to afraid to ever push really through . No offense or anything but by just looking at this movie you can tell it was directed by a woman . It's just too obvious all . It features lots of dancing and jumping around , sincere and realistic emotions , kissing around and all the male characters have all the usual stereotypical element in them ( of which most are true of course ) . All the men are pigs , who love to drink , try to hide their emotions , slap around and all they try is to get in a woman's pants . The movie is also filled with lots off elements that I suppose are part of female sexual fantasies . All of the sex and love in this movie seems to be focused purely in a way women want it to be . Nothing wrong with that all of course but it just doesn't work for a mainstream movie , with also big name actors in it . After you've already been nominated and have won an Oscar ( both for " The Piano " ) , you just can't expect from people to take your further work as anything small - and without ambitious intentions . Without Harvey Keitel in it , I would had probably never finished watching this movie . He's a great actor that is great in his role and helps to keep the movie going . And well Kate Winslet , I just never have been really a fan of hers , although she certainly has qualities as an actress . Pam Grier plays a far too small role in this movie . They should had made her role bigger , to provide the movie at least with one more good and interesting character . It also could had uplifted the story and provided it with some more layers . A really big missed opportunity here . Pointless , redundant , awful .
484890	1416505	75931	4.0	Unconvincing , uninteresting , unlikely . . . almost unwatchable .	As much as I love science-fiction movies , as much as I love ' 70's movies and as much as I love movies with silly premises , I just didn't liked this one . The movie started of promising and seemed tense and mysterious . However after the opening , the movie picks about the least interesting and convincing approach and the story got lost in a jungle of weird , uninteresting and highly unlikely moments . The middle just wasn't good and interesting enough to keep my attention . It becomes all too obvious that the movie is an attempt to cash in after the success of " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " . The story shows a bit too many similarities and Proteus obviously of course is the same as HAL 9000 , only less scary and less convincing . The movie tries to be deep and clever with its story but it instead works out shallow and unconvincing due to an unconvincing and uninteresting storyline . In a way you can call this movie a " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " for dummies . The premise of a woman being locked inside of a high-tech filled house and is being held hostage by a supercomputer just isn't the most exciting and convincing story they could had come up with , considering its good and in a way relevant subject , about computers and technique eventually taking over the human-race . It becomes all the more unconvincing when the intentions of the super computer become clear ; he wants to impregnate the woman to create a hybrid child , eventually resulting in the rape of the woman . The movie could had been tense and above all also thought-provoking . It now instead is a silly ' 70's mess , with a silly and uninteresting premise that also barely entertains enough . The middle drags on for way too long , without much interesting or tense happening in it . The buildup and story-flow falls flat and the movie is only still mildly interesting and good to watch in some few sequences , mainly due to its good - and good looking technical sequences . Normally Julie Christie is always great to watch in any movie . She has played in classics such as ; " Doctor Zhivago " , " Fahrenheit 451 " , " Don't Look Now " and the more recent ; " Dragonheart " , " Troy " and " Finding Neverland " . She however was simply awful in this movie to be frank . Her performance was emotionless and unconvincing and she didn't seemed comfortable with her role and the movie its story . A silly , unconvincing , technical good looking movie , which subject deserved a better plot .
485012	1416505	213149	5.0	Titanic II	Contains minor spoilersThe movie tries too hard to be like " Titanic " and uses all the ingredients that are used in " Titanic " but " Pearl Harbor " fails . . . The biggest problem with this movie is that the film makers can't seem to decide what for a movie they wanted to make : A spectacular one or a realistic one , with as a result that the realistic / shocking scene's in the movie just don't work in the way they should . The actors only seems to have been cast because of their looks instead of their acting skills . Especially the nurses look unrealistic beautiful complete with make-up and hair style . And then the love story . . . well what can I say , the love story just doesn't work for me and is over the top at some points SPOILERfor instance when Evelyn ( Kate Beckinsale ) finds out she is pregnant , that just seemed so over the top and out of place that I almost stopped watching the movie at that pointSPOILER You can say that the love story kind of ruins the movie at some points . The character are not interesting enough due to poor character development and I wondered lot's of times throughout the movie : " Why are we following this characters ? ? ? What makes them so interesting to follow ? ? ? " In my opinion the movie should have focused more on the political aspects of Pearl Harbor and the leaders , like Roosevelt ( Jon Voight ) and the attack itself instead of Rafe and Danny ( Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett ) and their friendship and problems . Another thing that bothered me is the Cuba Gooding Jr . character . The character is just pointless and it's only distracting and seem so out of place . The only reason I can think of why they had put them in the movie is because it's a political correct character to put in a movie . One more thing before I'll mention the things I liked about the movie . The movie makes an huge mistake to not stop after the attack on Pearl Harbor . The movie goes on and follows the Doolittle raid on Japan . This is absolutely pointless and I think that an alternate ending should had been made . The things I liked : First of all , I thought all the Roosevelt ( Jon Voight ) scene's were fantastic . Secondly Alec Baldwin played in my opinion a great role as Lt . Colonel James ' Jimmy ' Doolittle . Some more things that I liked are : The camera work ( although it was VERY over the top ) , the editing ( the movie has a good quick pace ) , the music by Hans Zimmer and the attack on Pearl Harbor itself was made beautifully . I don't mean to bash the movie too hard , but it just isn't good enough . If you want to see a good spectacular / realistic war movie you should watch " Black Hawk Down " instead and if you want to see a good realistic war movie you should watch " Saving Private Ryan " . Only watch this movie for the special effects and when you have nothing else to do , you might even like it ( I know that some people just love this movie ) .
485421	1416505	307466	5.0	No thumbs up for this one . . .	I watched this movie for two reasons ; The amazing Gary Oldman and for the music by Michael Giacchino of whom I'm a fan ever since his " Medal of Honor " scores . The movie was not completely a waste of time but it also was far from good . Man to blame is I think director Michael Stevens , you can tell by looking at this movie that he is just too unexperienced . There are some well executed sequences but there are way more scene's that are just poorly done also due to some weird and dumb camera positions and some poor editing . Michael Stevens tries to impress the viewer with some shots of nature , it only works distracting and doesn't do much good to the pace . Maybe he should consider a career as documentary maker ? The story is also quite a problem . It takes a while before you understand what the movie is all about . Once you pick up the story the movie is actually not bad , it's just that it has been done about a hundred times before . Ving Rhames tries but he just ain't no good leading actor , I liked his costume but that's about all the positive I can say . Gary Oldman is in his element as psychopathic villain . He played a lot of roles like this before but in his case you just never get tired of it . Brian Cox is also excellent in a small supporting role . And keep an eye on Arie Verveen , I expect great things for him in the future . If you can ignore the bad dialog , story , plot-holes and directing you'll see that there is some good in this movie and that it is a watchable one that is fairly entertaining as an action movie but not a must see in any way .
485274	1416505	109278	5.0	The movie is good thriller material but the last 30 minutes are ridicules .	The movie starts of well . The story is nicely build up and the characters are portrayed nicely . The story itself is pretty well constructed and has some good thriller elements in it . Nothing too original but enough fine story material to make a good decent movie with . However in the last 30 minutes the movie loses all its credibility when the story becomes unlikely and the characters their actions also become ridicules to follow . It's a real shame . Not that the movie had really much potential but it still seemed good enough material to make a pleasant , light easy to follow-thriller with . The actors certainly seemed to believe in the movie . It's too bad that after the well build up first halve , the second halve and especially toward the ending of the movie , all logic is abandoned and the movie turns into nothing more than a ridicules and unlikely thriller . All of the sudden several new characters pop-up that not only seem unnecessary but they are also lacking in fundamental things such as likability , credibility and depth . At times I didn't even knew who were the good guys and the bad guys anymore . Bruce Greenwood does a really good job at portraying his character . Virginia Madsen also does a decent job but her performance is not as memorable . She also isn't always likable enough as the main character . Her actions don't always make her character believable and likable enough . Not Madsen her fault of course , just blame it on the script . The movie is made without much style and flair . A typical made-for-TV movie . It's not the most exciting or original thriller to watch but it's still all decent enough , aside from the horrible final 30 minutes of the movie .
484589	1416505	47429	5.0	Singing Mounties . . . oh dear !	Aren't singing Mounties the first sign of the Apocalypse ? This is a below average standard MGM musical , from the period when the genre was already dying . Problem is that the movie really lacks a good story . It's not until the second halve that the movie is finally starting to show some progress and some plot lines but it's then already too late to still really make something good of the movie . The love story , which is always essential in this type of movies , isn't much interesting which is due to the characters and actors that portray them . Ann Blyth is mostly irritating with her thick overdone French-Canadian accent , that by the way seems to come and go randomly . She also doesn't look convincing enough as a woman who feels at home in the wilderness . She looks far too timid and pretty for that . Also hard to imaging that she would really fall and really become happy with such a ' criminal ' as Duval . The character treatment is also quite poor . Seemingly important characters just suddenly disappear out of the movie for too long and basically all characters are extreme stereotypes . You know it's one of those musicals in which the characters just suddenly burst into singing , in the middle of some dialog , to express their thoughts and feelings . This always have been quite ridicules in my book . The movie does get extra points for its environment . The Canadian natures serves as a beautiful backdrop for this movie ! Not a complete waste of time but still a below average late MGM attempt .
484812	1416505	839980	5.0	Watchable but just not among the best recent sport comedies .	Sport comedies recently really have become popular again , with movies such as " Dodgeball : A True Underdog Story " , " Blades of Glory " , " Talladega Nights : The Ballad of Ricky Bobby " and " Balls of Fury " . Some of them are great while others are just pretty lame . I'm afraid this movie is one of the latter ones . It's so easy to make fun of the ' 70's in comedies . This movie uses basically all of the clichés existing regarding the ' 70's . The movie comically only mainly purely relies on the fact that it is being set on the ' 70's . It relies a bit too much on it , since it alone just not enough to make a good and funny comedy with . It's also getting a bit old , comedies that are making fun of the ' 70's . Writer Scot Armstrong also already did it before for the movie " Starsky & Hutch " , which worked out still much better . Yes , of course it has some moments but it's one of those movies that has more misses than hits comedy-wise . But a bigger problem is perhaps the movie its story . It's such a simplistic , weak and formulaic written movie . It's also as if the story is being completely forgotten at times and the movie only serves as a medium for Will Ferrell to deliver as many funny moments as possible . Perhaps this is also due to the fact that Kent Alterman is still unexperienced as a director and this was actually his first directing job for a motion picture . He used to work before with Ferrell as an executive producer on the movie " Elf " . Still it's Will Ferrell who keeps the movie watchable and mostly fun to watch . This is a real Will Ferrell movie , which however also means that all of the other characters and actors are being pushed completely to the background . Even actors such as Woody Harrelson and Maura Tierney . Yes , they are in the movie but the movie basically would had been just as good with other , less known , actors in their roles , since this movie really basically is all about Will Ferrell . What's even the point of their roles really ? So in a way Ferrell is both a strong as well as a weak point of the movie . Still of course the movie remains perfectly watchable for the fans of him . It has entertainment value but not really a sport comedy I would recommend .
485402	1416505	82700	5.0	Just one of those Italian " Cannibal Holocaust " - wannabees .	" Cannibal Holocaust " really spawned a whole bunch of cannibal movies during the ' 80's . Of course all these type of movies are more or less the same but this movie doesn't even try to be original or hide that it was heavily inspired by " Cannibal Holocaust " and uses lots of elements from the successful " Cannibal Holocaust " but it doesn't really succeed with any of its elements as well as " Cannibal Holocaust " did . The story , settings and atmosphere are all very uninvolved feeling . The movie features lots of random sequences , mostly which feature real animal killings . You're just waiting for the first killing to occur but it actually takes quite awhile for the cannibal themes of the movie kick in . The story wastes too much time on building up stuff that just isn't interesting . It develops its characters but what do we care , since we know that most of them are probably going to die soon anyway . Besides , they are not being played by very great actors , to put it mildly . But once the cannibalism kicks in the movie becomes quite good . It becomes an entertaining movie , that of course also features lots of graphic sequences , though it never feels as anything too shocking , since the movie doesn't really feel involving in any way . The movie also made an odd choice to feature also quite some sequences set in New York , at several points in the movie . It's really distracting for the movie and doesn't work well for the pace . The movie has too many slow points and its gore / horror is not quite enough to uplift the movie to great heights . Yet it's also far from the worst genre movie I've seen . Even though the quality of the directing and such isn't always top-notch , it's a well enough put together movie that features ingredients to please the genre fans , even though they will also probably be disappointed by the fact that this movie wasn't trying to be a bit more original of its own . Entertaining but not really pleasing enough .
483954	1416505	300556	5.0	It falls flat as an entertaining and ambitious movie .	" Timeline " is a movie that sounds good on paper but as a movie it falls flat . This is due to several reasons of which the cast and the script are a few . I really enjoy time travel movies in which 2 different cultures and times collapse . It's always good for some entertainment and an imaginative story . Than how comes " Timeline " doesn't work as entertainment ? Well , mainly because it's simply not entertaining . From a director like Richard Donner you should and could expect some more entertainment and fun . The movie takes itself very serious , which makes the story uninteresting and at times also hard to follow . Basically the movie is about the British and French fighting each other , without us ever fully understanding why , or caring about it . The story had all the potential of becoming a sort of new ' Indiana Jones ' like adventure movie but unfortunately the end result is far from that . At times the story gets incredibly lame and predictable . The movie is terribly miscast . Basically all of the archaeological roles , are terribly miscast and no one is believable enough in their roles . There are some good actors in this movie but they are however not suited for their roles in this movie . Because of the odd casting choices , we also never really get to care , or know the characters well enough . The movie also lacks a good real main villain , with some clear motivations . In a time when we are accustomed to movie fights like in " Gladiator " or the Lord of the Rings movies , you have to come to the simple conclusion that the fight sequences in " Timeline " are a disappointment . The scene's are relatively cheap looking and lack a sense of scale . The movie isn't bad looking and there are still some good scene's though . Also the musical score by Brian Tyler was a good one , even though I would had still prefer Jerry Goldsmith of course . Not entertaining enough and the story and characters fully prevent this movie from being a good one .
483829	1416505	13140	6.0	It just couldn't grab me .	Normally I enjoy watching old movies from the ' 20's , even the more slower paced one's but this movie just didn't do it for me , although it also is of course far from the worst I have ever seen . The movie has a good enough story but it isn't exactly the most intriguing or tense stories to follow . Lots of sequences don't seem to have a relevant enough importance . It might have to do with the fact that the original length of the movie was over 6 hours long , which might had shown some of the relevance of certain sequences and characters but there is really no way I'm ever going to watch this longer version . The movie was already overlong as it was . The movie didn't had very much interesting drama in it and although the main character seemed intriguing , it just didn't worked out powerful enough in the movie . The movie also isn't as technically advanced as some of the other movies from the same time period , clearly directed by more talented and more experimental directors such as F . W . Murnau , Fritz Lang , Victor Sjöström and D . W . Griffith , among others . But this all of course doesn't mean that the movie is a bad one to watch . The story of a fake Russian aristocratic lady-killer in Monte Carlo trying to get money from rich ladies as on its own quite a good story and in a way for movie standards also ahead of its time . Many more movies like this one , in many different forms were made and are still being made , many years later now . In this particular case this is a movie I wouldn't mind seeing remade , perhaps also with some more humor in it and a more clear message . The movie also uses some quite good camera positions , on a positive note . Also the acting is good enough , though Miss DuPont seems heavily miscast as a pretty 21 year young girl . She is too old looking for her role and she also most certainly wasn't pretty enough to find the story very convincing . Same perhaps goes for Dale Fuller . Erich von Stroheim plays the real main part of the movie and he does this with lots of flair . He also wrote and directed the movie . Laurel & Hardy regular Mae Busch shows up in a serious role for a change and it was refreshing to see her like that for a change . Certainly a watchable movie but really no essential viewing in my opinion .
485496	1416505	338111	6.0	Nice action but kind of lame story .	Once again the action is just wonderful ( what else did you expect from a man like John Woo ? ) but the story itself is kind of lame and ridicules . Some of the things just don't make any sense and even though it's just a few minutes short , the movie is still filled with plot holes . Not Woo's fault , he just does what he can do best ; Film breathtaking action sequence's . Also the movie is edited pretty poorly at times , especially towards the ending . The music by Steve Jablonsky also was one of the highlights of the movie . It was a good action score that suited the movie well . He is still an unknown composer but I expect this to change in the next few years . Remember this name people ! Still slightly a bit of a disappointing part of " The Hire " series of shorts but still very well watchable , thanks to the action .
483859	1416505	87985	6.0	Wolverines !	The story is kept pretty simple and straightforward and also touched a sensitive nerve at the time , since the cold war was still fully going on at the time . It's about the Russians and Cubans invading the United States and thereby unleashing WW III . The movie focuses on a small group of teenagers in a small American town , who turn themselves into an effective guerrilla force , named the Wolverines , to battle the communist invaders . But the movie does not really have a sense of realism . The movie doesn't feel like this could have ever or shall ever really occur . It's because the movie is rather simple . It also doesn't really tries to provoke or anything . This movie feels more like a spoof of what can actually happen than a serious movie trying to make a statement and sent out a warning . It's hard to ever take this movie seriously and just see it for what it is ; pure entertainment . All of the Russians and Cubans are extremely stereotypical evil and their methods and regime reminds more of the WW II Nazi-regime . But I think that the movie also does a good job as portraying the Americans not as kind-hearted peace loving folks . It shows that nobody is really innocent in a war time situation and you're being forced into things you normally wouldn't ever do or even think of . The movie its battle sequence are pretty good looking . The invasion forces and their weapons look good and realistic and the movie has some nice action sequences . Overall the movie really does give you the sense and feeling of an actual war-time situation . The movie also has some nice looking scenery and with yet another awesome musical score from Basil Poledouris , who did some of his best work with director John Milius . The movie has a great ' 80's cast with big names from that period such as Patrick Swayze , C . Thomas Howell , Lea Thompson , Charlie Sheen , Jennifer Grey and Harry Dean Stanton . Grey and Swayze would later work together again as the two main characters in " Dirty Dancing " , despite the fact that they didn't like each other very much personally . It's not really a great movie but interesting to watch nevertheless because of its concept .
484081	1416505	955413	6.0	Lacks a clear purpose .	You know , this sort of 10 minute short movies should always have a provoking or clever message in it , or just should purely entertain , also by showing of some skills from the director's part . This movie really doesn't do any of that . If there is a message in this movie then I surely missed it . The movie tries to handle a delicate subject , regarding falling for a Turkish girl , while yourself are Dutch and get confronted by the dangers of the so called ' honor revenge ' by the direct family of the girl , which still is a hot-subject in the Netherlands . Director Lodewijk Crijns uses all the stereotypes about the Muslim and Turkish culture in particular that exist and of course exaggerates them , to a point when they go completely over-the-top . It's probably also the reason why this movie probably works better as entertainment than as anything provoking , though of course some people will remain feeling offended by this movie . Lodewijk Crijns has a sort of reputation as a weird movie-maker . " Jezus is een Palestijn " is probably one of the weirdest Dutch movie's to have ever hit cinemas . This short movie also shows some weird tendencies and style but it overall is too short all to consider this movie an ' odd ' one , or anything like that . Yolanthe Cabau van Kasbergen doesn't seem like a likely pick for the title role , mainly because , well she is not Turkish at all and it's not like that there aren't any good Turkish actresses around who would had wanted to play the role . Plus on top of that Yolanthe Cabau van Kasbergen is a person who acts mostly in soap-series and other low-budget production , so she also isn't the greatest talent around , in the business . The only reason why they seemed to have cast her in the role was to receive some free publicity ( which mostly failed by the way , although I'm sure that if she wasn't in this , this movie would had been even more unknown to the public . ) , since she is considered to be one of the most beautiful Dutch-female at the time and since her role is a provoking one , when it comes down to showing some skin and I admit , she really is not punishment to look at in this movie . It's not really that this movie is bad or not entertaining enough , it's just that it lacks a real purpose and is nothing more than a simple pleasant waste of time . Only recommendable if you want to see Yolanthe Cabau van Kasbergen's hot body , which should be reason enough for some people to watch this .
485558	1416505	112705	6.0	Weak Columbo entry .	I wouldn't exactly call this movie an horrible one but compared to the usual Columbo movie standards , this is a rather weak entry in the long running successful series , starring Peter Falk . Some very odd things are happening in this movie , that just don't feel ' Columbo-like ' . I would call this movie a rather unrealistic one , even for usual Columbo movie standards . It also really isn't the most clever Columbo movie around and it's actually a quite poorly written one , that perhaps even becomes a bit ridicules at part . Also the way the murder itself is being planned out and committed is quite ridicules in my opinion . Vincent McEveety always was a director who tried out some new things for his Columbo movies , often with success but there also are some movies that simply don't work out well enough , of which this is obviously one . It's also often a real slow movie . Some of the sequences go on for far too long , which I blame to the dialog . Some of the dialog is absolutely dragging and its the type of dialog in which the same things get said 3 times over again . It makes some of the sequences within this movie annoying to watch as well . The movie also isn't really helped by its cast . George Wendt isn't an horrible actor but yet he really doesn't act well in this movie , so you can say he got miscast . It's still interesting to see Rod Steiger in this Columbo movie and his role is actually quite bigger than he gets credited for . Hardly the best or most interesting role out of his career but it's nice watching him in this nevertheless . Peter Falk also does his very best but I wouldn't call it the best performance out of his career , which again , is mostly also due to the movie its dialog . So really not the best Columbo movie around , although I also just wouldn't call this movie an horrible one .
484558	1416505	277296	6.0	A decent action-movie / adventure flick . What else did you expect ?	I think nobody expected this movie to be a masterpiece but people did expected this movie to be an entertaining action-flick , on par with the two The Mummy movies , of which this movie is a direct spin-off . The movie does not disappoint in its action , which makes " The Scorpion King " a far from great but still a certainly watchable movie . The Rock is no actor but he is a great action-hero star . Despite his flawed acting he is believable and likable in his role . The movie has a solid supporting cast . Steven Brand is a great villain actor and I expect more good villainous roles from him in the future . Michael Clarke Duncan is a welcome addition , even though the movie could had done without his character . It further more has well known actors Kelly Hu and Bernard Hill appearing in this movie . This is the sort of movie which I imaging would have been great for stunt performers to work on . The movie is action packed and filled with some nicely choreographed fighting sequences and other fine action sequences , including big explosions and all sorts of weapons . The action movie fan will not be disappointed with this movie and there is plenty for him or her to enjoy in this movie . Of course the story is almost non-existent but honestly what else did you expect ? The story isn't really anything new and it rips off multiple movies without shame . The movie is not filled with any surprises but anyone who had expected a tight waterproof , original plot are apparently also not familiar with the two The Mummy movies , which also were far from perfect or original when it comes to the plot and story . Unfortunately director Chuck Russell isn't the most talented guy in the business , you can tell that by looking at this movie . His style feels inexperienced , even though he already had quite some experience as a director while shooting this movie . At what it tries to achieve , the movie is successful . It brings some good mindless , action-packed entertainment .
483904	1416505	91178	6.0	Fun combination of horror and comedy . I wish the movie had more laughs in it though .	It's amazing that a movie with such a concept and people involved wasn't more fun to watch . The movie seriously lacked some good laughs at times and I feel that the movie in its core had far more potential . It's obvious that Gene Wilder wanted to make a Mel Brooks kind of movie . The movie definitely has the same atmosphere and ideas as " Young Frankenstein " . Unfortunately its not as good and it shows how much quality Mel Brooks actually has , to have the skill to have simple , predictable and silly humor and still make an hilarious and classic movie with it . The humor in this movie is just as absurd and predictable and unfortunately it just doesn't always work out . The story is totally uninteresting and just serves as an excuse to put as many crazy characters as possible into the movie . It's a weird looking bunch with Dom DeLuise playing a woman ! Could be me but I thought the sight of him was pretty darn hilarious ! Halve of the time I didn't even bother to wanted to know what the story was all about , it was that absurd really ! The movie of course also features Gene Wilder but unfortunately he hasn't given himself better material and dialog to work with . So it's hardly his best or most comical role . The movie further more also features Jonathan Pryce , in one of his earlier movie roles . Quite frankly I don't understand who the movie has such a bad reputation . I mean the movie is not all that bad . Yes , you have to like these sort of movies ( Mel Brooks-type of humor movies ) but I've seen far worse genre movies receiving far better criticism . It just doesn't seem really fair . The special effects are definitely acceptable for its genre and year it was made in . So was its make-up and its entire professional visual look . If you like these type of movies its very well worth seeing , though it's definitely not the best movie in its genre that is around .
484719	1416505	87755	6.0	Enjoyable enough Muppet vehicle .	This is a rather enjoyable and harmless entertaining Muppet movie , featuring most of the well known Muppets . It really isn't their best or most memorable one though . Lets face it and be honest here , this movie really isn't the greatest made or best written one . The only real reason that the movie still works out is thanks to the Muppets . The humor actually isn't that much good , since its mostly simply written and the events are predictable . Nevertheless the movie still manages to become funny because of the humorous and well known characters , that need no introduction . For me it really was in this case Miss Piggy that makes the movie work out . Her character features by far the most humorous and enjoyable situations . Miss Piggy is basically a Muppet-favorite of every one ! She is such a great and comical character . Also the idea alone that a grown up man , such as Frank Oz , is with his hand inside a silly looking pig and doing a very feminine voice is reason enough already to crack me up . I really respect the Muppet-performers and their timing and handling is always just great , especially Frank Oz who always is subtle and handles the most enjoyable Muppet characters . Besides acting , Frank Oz also was the person who directed and wrote the movie . The movie concentrates a bit too much on just the two main characters of the movie ; Kermit and Miss Piggy . Also the human cast gets wasted because of that but of course also most of the Muppet characters . They put ( too ) many Muppets in the movie but doesn't provide them with enough room to let them shine , or their characters speak out . They tried to do so by putting in some extra solo sequences , featuring some of the Muppet characters , which felt like a last minute addition but was amusing , though distracting , nevertheless . The movie also features Rizzo the Rat in his first big movie role but it's too bad that he didn't teamed up with Gonzo yet in this on . The movie could had really used another and distracting from the main plot , comical duo , besides Kermit and Miss Piggy . The movie yet again features many cameo from well known actors and other celebrities . Celebrities and Muppets always have been a great combination . Not only well known ( at the time ) celebrities make a cameo but also the " Sesame Street " characters do so , toward the ending . It's obvious that they used this movie as a vehicle to also use some new puppet techniques , that in my opinion however don't work out and are redundant . Showing the Muppet's legs when they walk , bad idea ! Putting someone in a Miss Piggy suit when she is on roller-blades , bad idea ! Though the movie is mostly forgettable it of course still features some great sequences such as the one with the Muppet babies . It also of course features some good comedy moments and it obviously makes this an enjoyable simple movie to watch but it's all not quite enough for this movie to really make a lasting impression . Out of all the Muppet movies this is probably the one with the most less re-playability factor .
485121	1416505	312549	6.0	Weak attempt by Bruckheimer to try and win an Oscar .	After making big successful action blockbusters such as " Con Air " , " Armageddon " and " The Rock " , it was obvious that producer Jerry Bruckheimer tried to go for an Oscar with this little dramatic movie . A weak attempt . The movie could have been good but it doesn't get any better as average . Who's to blame ? Probably the director Joel Schumacher , he delivers a shallow drama without any emotions . Or maybe it's because of the main character . The character of Veronica Guerin never really becomes interesting or completely understandable with as a result that the viewer doesn't really get emotionally involved . Director Schumacher tries to make Veronica's character a warm loving mother and wife but fails completely in this and all the families scene's feel more like an obligation . Another crucial mistake is that in all the advertisements and also in the beginning of the movie it was told that Veronica Guerin was murdered . Now I'm sure that this is common knowledge in Ireland but I can assure you that it isn't in the rest of Europe and especially not outside of it . In a way it already ruined the movie for me . I know that this movie isn't made for entertainment but to tell Veronica's story instead but surely they could have made it more interesting for the viewer to watch by not telling how it would end . I know that Cate Blanchett was much praised for her role but quite frankly I didn't liked her all that much . But Maybe the reason for that had more to do with Veronica's character and not so much with Cate Blanchett's acting skills . But all in all this movie is not a punishment to watch but like I said before it simply doesn't get any better as average .
484211	1416505	56931	6.0	Good premise and a promising beginning but the last halve of the movie is ridicules .	The movie starts of as a really promising science-fiction / thriller in the same style as movies such as " Invasion of the Body Snatchers " . Judging by just the first halve of the movie , this movie could had really grown into a science-fiction classic , if only the second halve of the movie had been just as good instead of just utterly ridicules and unlikely as it was . " Village of the Damned " , of which this movie loosely is a sequel , already wasn't exactly a masterpiece but it still grew out to be a classic , mainly thanks to its atmosphere and original story . " Children of the Damned " is in many ways similar to its predecessor . It has a promising concept and story but the execution of it all is just plain weak at times , which makes " Children of the Damned " nothing more than just an average science-fiction flick that just doesn't leave a lasting - or good impression . I loved were the movie was heading to in the beginning . The story seemed promising and it all seemed like good enough material to make a good and pleasant horror like science-fiction movie with . But then suddenly the movie takes a not so positive turn , from the moment on when the children hide in the church . The story becomes utterly ridicules from that moment on and on top of that it also becomes uninteresting and not always totally understandable . I still don't exactly understand what the purpose and plan of the children was because the second halve of the movie is told so weak and ridicules . The movie had potential but all of that is ruined in its second halve . The acting was quite solid and the movie had some good and interesting characters in it , that deserved a better character-treatment . There still are some good and memorable moments in the movie and fans of British science-fiction / horror will still find plenty to enjoy in this movie but it just isn't one of those movies that leaves a very big impression . The story-telling , in especially its second halve , is far too weak for that . Just as bad / good as its predecessor .
484963	1416505	35777	6.0	Messy and not that funny .	Problem with this movie is that nothing in the movie really feels connected to each other . The story feels messy and weak . On top of that the supporting actors were also quite horrible in their roles . No , this is not the best Laurel & Hardy movie . It still is good for some laughs certainly but overall it's a disappointing movie to watch . The movie already begins weak and unfunny . The movie does get better as it progresses but it never reaches the same level as any of the other Laurel & Hardy movies . Another disappointment was Stan Laurel . He didn't seem to play his character with as much joy as he used to do and his acting was to be honest poor at times . Still watchable but not really recommendable , even though the movie does have its moments .
484843	1416505	844894	6.0	Quite honestly the best of the " Species " - seuqels .	This fourth entry is surprisingly the best out of the series when it comes down to the sequels . Yet the movie is probably best to watch when you don't know any of the previous Species movies , fore in that way the mystery and originality of the movie will work out the best . It's also really not essential to watch any of the previous Species movies before watching this one , fore this movie and its story have basically very little to do with any of the previous entries , that were about aliens trying to breed and being hunt down by the military . This movie takes a totally different direction and approach . As a sequel and especially as a third sequel to the 1995 movie , this movie is surprisingly refreshing in its ideas and executions . No , of course it's no brilliant movie but I'm still raving about it since it's so surprisingly much better than any of its sequels and original as well . Of course not a lot of people are willing to give this movie a chance but I'll urge more people to see this , since it's simply a fine genre movie that is worth watching . It isn't the best or most exciting movie but it's a professionally made one , which makes this a maintaining movie to watch . It doesn't suffer from some of the problems of the other sequels , that had some bad actors in it , among other things . This movie has some good characters and even better actors portraying them . Ben Cross is a good actor and a nice leading man for this movie . Hard to believe he already was 60 years old at the time of this movie ! Still I would wish the movie was a bit more exciting . It's a bit lacking in action and definitely lacking in gore . All of the other Species movies were filled with gore and nudity , while this movie features basically little to none of any . It's a quite tame movie , with the expectations of some sequences , that are used to set up a specific mood and tone . The movie is a bit of a bore in parts and often drags on for too long with its story , which is the fault of its writing that offers the movie too little . Some things don't make a lot of sense within this movie and story and some things just don't really add up . However because it's such a fine put together , with a good visual look over it and some nice actors involved , this movie works out as a perfectly watchable one .
484069	1416505	382365	6.0	Far from political correct or subtle but because of that also very entertaining .	This movie is really a breath of fresh . After watching almost nothing else but heavy Dutch period drama's , drama's in particular and war productions , there finally now is a simple , spectacular and entertaining Dutch movie , in the form of " Vet Hard " . The humor in this movie is cruel and violent . Though it's far from subtle all , it still makes you laugh . To be honest , I think you have to be Dutch to fully understand and appreciate the humor of the movie . The movie however does goes a bit too far at times , even for my taste . I mean having one of the main characters being a necrophiliac serial killer just is not my idea of good taste and quality of humor . The story is simple and almost non-existent . It's just a pile up of gangster movie clichés and over-the-top comical situations . You clearly shouldn't take this movie serious and watch it for what it is . This movie is a real no-brainer that certainly does entertain and give you a good 88 minutes . As simple as the movie may be , the quality of it is certainly good . The movie is directed with lots of feeling for pace and handles the characters nicely as well . The action sequences are definitely the best elements of the movie . They are superbly choreographed and even brought better to the screen , also with the help of some excellent editing . It makes it obvious that Tom Oliehoek is a great new young action-movie director , who perhaps already is too big for the Netherlands . Of course the quality and size of it all doesn't hold a candle to an average overdone Hollywood blockbuster production . But this has nothing to do with the directing qualities and talent of Tim Oliehoek but more with the low budget , though for Dutch standards this still was a very expensive movie . At least the movie is no ' Hollywood wannabe ' . It has quality and style of its own and it gives the movie its very own unique identity . The acting to be honest surpassed expectations . You normally wouldn't expect quality acting in an action / comedy like this but his movie has some good actors in it , who all did a good job . Jack Wouterse normally doesn't play main characters and in some movies his role is even no more than just a bit part . I already liked him very much as an actor before this movie but I like him even more now . He shows that he can handle bigger roles and that he is capable of carrying an entire movie for most part on his own . Other fine Dutch and Belgian actors also portray some fine other roles . So , Tim Oliehoek is not just a great action director but also one fine actors director . Only thing is that the movie has a bit too many characters with as a result that not every characters works out as fine or comical as the other . The movie is also filled with lots of cameos of famous Dutch celebrities . I was afraid this was going to get an overkill of it but the did a good job at keeping it to a minimum and till a point were it doesn't get ridicules or distracting from the story . The fact that I rate this movie only a 6 has nothing to do with its entertainment value . It's just as entertaining as some other movies which I rated a 8 in the past , it's just of lesser quality all . But seeing the circumstances ( only 40 days of shooting , for many complicated action sequences included , a ? 3 , 700 , 000 budget . ) you have to give credit to this movie and its entire cast & crew .
484971	1416505	320691	6.0	A good looking - and good enough movie .	The movie is wonderfully made and has a perfectly , moody dark atmosphere . The visual effects are convincing enough and there are some nicely shot action sequences . Still the movie is not as good as it could had been , especially when considering what its concept is . Problem with the movie is that it isn't really an entertaining one to watch . The movie could had really used some humor at times and the story and the movie in general , takes itself way too serious . It makes the movie a bit heavy and hard one to watch at times and because of this all the movie doesn't really have an high entertainment value . Another thing is that the story becomes unnecessary hard to follow at times , because of the very same reason . The movie is not halve as entertaining as it could had been . The concept of the movie ; Werewolves versus vampires sounds good but the execution of it is done too seriously . It's done with style certainly but not with a sense for entertainment . The result is a good looking - but mostly empty movie that isn't really always constantly pleasant to watch . The movie also lacks some real likable characters . Seline is a cool chick but I don't have the feeling that we ever fully get to know and understand her . Also there is absolutely no chemistry between Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman , which makes parts of the movie weak at times . The acting is fair enough . The actors fit their roles well and that is what really counts . Bill Nighy is always great to watch in a movie and this one is no exception . He plays the best part of the movie , a sort of über-vampire . It certainly is a watchable movie , especially to those who also liked the first two Blade movies . I'll probably also watch its sequel " Underworld : Evolution " but probably not earlier until when it arrives on DVD .
485358	1416505	117894	6.0	Such a silly movie that I can't help enjoying .	" Thinner " is just one of those movies that I always enjoy watching when its on . It's basically a great way to spend 90 minutes . I think the foremost reason why this is such a watchable movie is thanks to its wonderful concept . Its highly original and you just can't go really wrong with it . The story nevertheless is quite silly in parts , which is I think also mainly because there are some difficulties with the book translation to the screen . What works in a book just doesn't always work for a movie . Another problem with movies based on books is that a book has a beginning and an end , with in between a couple of hundred pages to lay out the story and characters and everything that happens in between . You then next have to try to put this all in an under 2 hour movie , without loosing the core and essence of the story . This most of the time has as a result that some things get rushed in the movie to get from point A to B . The actual ending is just great but there are also still some problems with it . Problem with the ending is that it's totally unclear why the main character is suddenly freaking out so bad and why he suddenly turns into psychotic murderer . Apparently a real returning theme in Stephen King novels ; the main character going psycho toward the ending . He blames his wife for everything that has happened but this is totally unbelievable and unlikely this would ever happen . She at least most certainly did not deserved to die because of it . They try to ' justify ' his killing of her even more by implying that she cheats on her husband with doctor Mikey . But again ; now way that that justifies the thing happening to her in the end . No way the story would had still worked out as good if the make-up effects weren't as good . Robert John Burke goes from extremely fat at the start to extremely thin toward the ending , all with the help of make-up . The movie looks like a made for TV movie , which is obviously due to its restrained budget . So don't expect anything big or surprising camera movements and innovating directing or editing . The movie also doesn't have a too great cast but each actor serves its purpose and fits its role . Actually quite silly and nothing too great but it's a perfectly watchable and enjoyable little movie .
485387	1416505	29516	6.0	Quite formulaic and maybe even borderline boring but still watchable for the true movie-buffs .	Reason why this movie in a way is perhaps a bit of a must see is because this movie features Jean Harlow in her last role before her death . She collapsed on the set and died not much later in the hospital at the age of 26 . She must have been quite ill during the entire production of this movie . Is this perhaps also a reason why her character becomes ill in the movie ? Because there is no real obvious other reason I can think of as of why they put that in the movie , it had little use or value to the movie its story or her character . But I surely wish that her last movie would had been a different and more worthy one . This comedy offers little entertainment and perhaps even is a bit boring at times because of the formulaic story . As a comedy it simply ain't funny enough and as a drama it ain't powerful enough . So it's a bit of a ' pointless ' movie to watch . It's an extremely average romantic movie were oh so many movies like this one had been made of already . Still the atmosphere is quite good . The movie has a kind of an almost childish innocence that lot of movies made for WW II had . During and after WW II , movie's became more serious and perhaps also more meaningful . It's obvious that this movie was made just to bring shear joy and entertainment to the people in the cinema . The whole singing in the train sequence's is perhaps the best example of the movie its innocence . Clark Gable is quite good in his role but the line's he has to deliver are simply at times just plain annoying . Also the fact that Lionel Barrymore was in this movie didn't do much good for me . As an actor I can't really stand Lionel Barrymore , he so often irritates me . Most certainly not recommendable , unless you're interested in seeing Jean Harlow in her last role .
484192	1416505	36112	6.0	Good looking but far too boring all .	To be perfectly honest , this was one of the most tiresome movies I have seen in a long while . It's a long and slow movie , that doesn't feature enough humor , drama or action . Instead it mixes all of these genre together but it's just not using enough of any of it . I'm sure I would had adored this movie if it only had some more comedy in it . It had all of the right type of characters for it but yet somehow the movie doesn't decide to push it through . Instead now the comedy works out often more as annoying than anything else really . The movie is completely character driven but the movie reaches a point that I just don't care about the character anymore . I don't care much about his love life , his military career . In that regard this movie in my eyes already is a failure . It just couldn't hold my interest . The movie too often drivels around too much and the movie feels quite bloated . It's made to look bigger than it in fact truly all is . Some sequences go on for far too long , without making an impression , or leave a significant enough purpose . And the movie doesn't get any better as it heads toward its ending . On the contrary , I would say . The movie tells basically the entire lifespan of a military man , from a young ambitious officer to a more realistic gray , fat , retired army colonel . We see him not only grow as a military man but also as a person , as he meets new people throughout his life and re-encounters a German officer and later friend , at various points throughout his career . This could had all provided a movie with an intriguing story and characters but because its so tiresome all , it just doesn't ever really work out as it was supposed to . Having said all of that ; it's a quite good looking movie . It's a movie that got made back in 1943 but yet it got shot in full color . This certainly gives the movie something extra . It has a great look , which not in the least is also due to some fine cinematography , from Oscar-winner Georges Périnal . He was a person who was already doing color movies in the late ' 30's . I just didn't liked this movie as much as everyone else seems to do .
484536	1416505	1103965	6.0	What a bleak show .	" The 80th Annual Academy Awards " shall go down in history as the show that almost wasn't there and the year without any surprises . The evening was nothing too bad but it all was just so standard and also the winners themselves didn't really gave away any memorable speeches or moments . While watching this I couldn't help wondering ; How good would they show had been if there was still a writer's strike ? Because of the writer's strike , this award show got almost narrowed done to an evening that would show montages from previous Academy Awards ceremonies and the winners being announced in between . It's obvious that they still implemented some of these montages in the actual show and to be honest , the montages were also the best moments during the evening . It showed all the previous movies that ever won for best picture and lots of winning actors and actresses as well as a couple of humorous montages such as one that paid homage to binoculars and one about waking up after having bad dreams . When especially compared to other years , there were hardly any political jokes or statements being made . Not even a lot of Obama , Clinton or Bush references . Not by presenter Jon Stewart , nor by any of the award winners . Not even any Iraq references were being made , other then of course the nominated documentaries , focusing on Iraq . Jon Stewart himself did a fair enough job as the evening's presenter . He had a couple of good fun moments but for most part of the evening he was just standing there filling up the gaps and announce the next categories . There was hardly any improvisation involved . Blame it on the writer's strike ? Most likely yes , for also the award presenters themselves hardly said anything , funny , good or memorable . All of the usual suspect were also present handing out the award , also no big surprises or anything memorable there . The only surprising thing perhaps there was Owen Wilson , who a couple of months ago attempted a suicide attempt . Guess he just wanted to show his face that he was still around and ready to make his Hollywood return . But also then again ; what's the point of letting him present something if he isn't going to do anything funny ? Basically all he did was entering the stage and said ; the nominees are . . . and the winner is . And as for the winners , well really were there any surprises ? The only thing perhaps was Marion Cotillard wining best actress in a leading role for " La Môme " . But other then that ; " No Country for Old Men " winning best picture , the Coen brothers winning best director , Daniel Day-Lewis winning , Javier Bardem winning and so on . None of the categories provided any surprising winners . Besides " No Country for Old Men " , the other big winner of the evening was " The Bourne Ultimatum " for winning three out of three Oscar ' , even though not for the most important categories obviously . Some great filmmakers spend their entire directing career without winning an Oscar ( Hithcock , Kubrick ) . I just can't help that I lost some of the respect I had for the Coen brothers after appearing on stage for each of their 3 wins , including best picture and best directing . I always thought that they were a couple of awesome young dogs who only made movies they really wanted to make but as it turns out they are pretty boring individuals . They acted like this was a normal every day for them and the Oscar was not a big thing for them . Perhaps the nicest winners of the evening were Diablo Cody for winning for best original screenplay for " Juno " , who was genuinely happy and emotional and Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová for winning best original song for " Once " . It was nice that they won , since it was a simply made movie , made on a shoe-string budget and with a couple of camcorder but became an huge success nevertheless . It also was nice that they allowed Markéta Irglová back on the stage to make her acceptance speech , after being cut off by the music before . Perhaps a good idea to give EACH of the award winners the time to make an acceptance speech ? I think it's quite disrespectful that in the case of three winners , only one is given the chance and time to make a speech . I mean , some of these people will probably never win an Oscar again . so please let them just enjoy this moment . Interesting thing to notice was also the amount of international winners , from outside the English speaking countries . It shows that not the best movies and filmmakers are all come from Hollywood and film-making has become a real universal thing , perhaps more than ever before . But really , do you always need to make a WW II to get nominated for best foreign movie ? When is this going to change . It was nice for Austria to win their first ever Oscar for " Die Fälscher " but they really need to broaden their view on foreign films , since there are so many other nice films around , concentrating on totally different subjects . Forgettable show , without any surprises , which perhaps is also a good thing since this doesn't annoy - or make anyone mad about things .
484328	1416505	240515	6.0	I laughed , so somehow it works .	first of all I can understand how someone could love this movie but I can also understand how someone could totally hate it . This movie and especially its humor is really a matter of taste more than anything else . I wouldn't dare to call this movie a good one . In fact it's far from it . Most of the moments in the movie make absolutely no sense and there is almost absolutely no story present . Most of the humor is also very vulgar and just totally over-the-top gross and visual . But yet this movie also really made me laugh . So how could I , when being completely fair and unbiased , possible call this movie a bad one ? I think that this movie is so bad that it becomes good . The jokes in the movie really aren't that strong but because they are delivered so incredibly over-the-top and stupid , it becomes truly an hilarious movie at times . Yes , so basically the movie is so stupid that it becomes a good one . The story is just totally weird and stupid and lacks some consistency . All of the events occurring in the movie don't really always feel connected . The comical situations are far from believable and they almost have nothing to do with the main story . In fact most of the time they are completely tasteless . Some , if not most people will probably not be able to handle this not so subtle sense of humor ( also hence the low rating here ) . No it absolutely is not the most subtle and consistent comedy ever made . Tom Green is totally over-the-top and crazy . He is not always funny but his character makes the crazy story somehow work . Rip Torn also shows his comical talent and he perhaps plays the best part of the movie . All of the other characters are somewhat muddled in to the crazy story . A comedy that doesn't make any sense but because of that becomes quite hilarious to watch at times . Clearly not a movie for everyone's taste obviously though .
483755	1416505	79817	6.0	Too slow , too boring , too average to be considered a worthy sequel .	This movie is not bad but it is simply too much of a repeating session of the first movie . The movie moves very slow and only really starts to become interesting after an hour . Luckily the movie begins to get pace a lot from the moment Rocky begins training again , which are also the best parts of the movie . The drama in the beginning just didn't do it for me , mainly because you already knew how it all would end . I'm sorry to say but Sly can't act . But still he is perfect for the role and I don't think the movie would have been any better without him . Somehow he still brings much live to the movie and the character . Talia Shire is good and believable as Rocky's shy girlfriend / wife . But what am I talking about drama and acting skills ? " Rocky " of course is all about boxing and everything else in the movie doesn't really matter . All the boxing scene's are amazing and I'm not just talking about the end fight but also about the training sessions also helped by Bill Conti's famous musical score which really gets you're adrenaline flowing . The biggest adrenaline rush of the movie is of course the end fight which just couldn't be long enough for me . The movie is worth watching for this alone and the ending actually always keeps bringing tears of joy to my eyes . Yes , I know I'm pathetic . The ending is of course totally over the top ; the music , the slow motion , the crowed , the tension but I love it ! Worth watching for the end fight alone .
485427	1416505	94933	6.0	Doesn't quite work out but still a perfectly watchable thriller .	This is a movie that tries hard but it doesn't quite takes the cake . The movie tries to put in many different successful thriller elements but the movie is nothing more than a mixture of styles that weakens the movie as a whole - and with a flawed and simple story in it . The movie is quite short and this is definitely notable in its script . The concept is quite great and it showed some good potential but the story is at all times kept rather simple and short and the movie its story mainly falls from one coincidence into the other , which really doesn't make this the most credible movie to watch . It's just too much of a series of unlikely events , even for thriller standards . Things just don't add up and the weak climax , that is more ridicules and lame than clever or credible , also doesn't help much . The movie its story gets poorly developed , which also makes the movie lack in some good tension or mystery . Yet the movie is a fairly well known movie in its genre , which seems odd , since it's definitely no text book example of a good thriller , even though all of the formulaic ingredients are present . It probably has to do with the fact that the movie has a good and well known cast . Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan are the main leads of the movie and like always they are great together . They also used to be a real-life couple for years , till Russell Crowe broke up their marriage in 2000 . However problem in the movie is that they're just an unlikely couple to team up . It just seems odd to me that a college professor would team up with one of his students , in the final hours of his life , to solve his own murder . But this is probably also the direct result of its poor story development that falls flat in the end and in which nothing quite adds up . On a positive note , Daniel Stern was good in a serious role . The movie tries to be noir , or at least an homage to film-noir , by using black & white images and certain camera-positioning ( strangly only at the beginning and ending of the movie and not the movie entirely . ) but also with its ' mysterious ' story and characters . After all , the movie is also a remake of a real classic film-noir from 1950 , by the same title . The end result however doesn't deserve to touch the genre with a 10 feet pole . It becomes nowhere close of being in the same league . This is due to the poorly developed and just weak story but also because it tries to bring in several ' 80's movie-making elements , which just doesn't work out . Oh and mixing film-noir style with ' 80's musical is always a bad idea ! It should be a rule ; if you pay homage to film-noir , don't ever put ' modern ' music under it . Further more also the typical ' 80's action editing works really lame and makes the action sequences look even cheaper and clumsier than they in fact really were . Also the black & white images don't look right because they don't seem to use proper lighting for it . One of this typical thrillers that is only watchable once .
484677	1416505	13341	6.0	The fist teaming up of Laurel & Hardy is a mixed one .	This is the very first movie with Laurel & Hardy as a comical duo , even though the two appear as enemies in this movie instead as friends . So I don't really consider this movie as a Laurel & Hardy picture . The first halve of the movie is the best . Stanley Laurel plays the maim character in the movie and he yet again gets himself into some silly trouble . Ironicaly from the moments Oliver Hardy makes his entrance the movie goes downhill . The movie starts to get incoherent and messy , especially in the final few sequences . Of course this movie is historically still an interesting to watch , since its the first movie in which Laurel & Hardy appear together in sequences . So for fans this still remains a sort of a must-see . Also fans of the early slapstick humor will still find plenty to enjoy in this movie . The movie is certainly better than the most other slapstick movies , made from the same period . For everyone else this movie probably remains a messy , incoherent silent comedy short that isn't really worth watching .
483731	1416505	372784	7.0	Batman re-imagined .	It's interesting to see a whole new different take on the Batman franchise . All of the previous Batman movies are ignored and this movie completely re-imaginings the story and the character of Bruce Wayne / Batman . I'm sure that the fans will like this new different approach towards the franchise . The character of Bruce Wayne / Batman is even darker and more sinister than in any of the previous movies . This is also the first time that the character of Bruce Wayne is much more interesting than that of Batman himself . It explores what it is that drives Bruce Wayne to fight crime in his batsuit . The movie unfortunately tries to cover a bit too much of his story . The story covers too much and a lot is happening in this movie . The movie tells how Bruce lost his parent , how he was trained , how he returned to Gotham and reclaimed all his property and in the mean time he fights many criminals such as Carmine Falcone , the Scarecrow and in the end another villain but who that is , I'm not going to spoil for you . It simply is all too much to just tell in one movie . There isn't one main villain which makes this movie a bit too hard to understand at times . I'm sure this is all that the fans wanted but from a storytelling point of view the movie is flawed . Because it covers so much , not everything always flows well or feels connected to each other . The story lacked a main plot line and only towards the ending the movie gets a more steady and clear story-line . There also are too many characters introduced in to movie . The movie could had also used some more humor . The movie takes itself too serious most of the time . There is some humor in the movie but that humor feels rather forced and childish / lame . There are two different kinds of darkness in movies ; atmospheric dark , like in the ' 89 version was the case and just normal dark , which in this movie is present . I prefer the atmospheric dark personally . I think they took ' dark knight ' perhaps a little bit too literally . The movie was simply too plain dark at times , without doing much good to the atmosphere . Strangely enough Gotham City itself wasn't dark enough looking . The Gothic Tim Burton look that made Gotham City such a memorable and imaginatively place is surely missed in this movie . The movie is superbly and impressively cast . Christian Bale is good as Bruce Wayne but not always as Batman . Michael Caine is a great Alfred . There was much hate towards Katie Holmes towards her role but that had more to do with her strange Tom Cruise affair than her acting abilities . I thought she did great in this movie and she portrayed a strong but sensitive female character . Other wonderful actors in the movie are Liam Neeson , Gary Oldman , Tom Wilkinson , Morgan Freeman and Ken Watanabe . Cillian Murphy truly surprised and impressed me in his villainous role . Like many others I thought , before seeing this movie , that he wasn't the right actor for a role like this one but he simply was more than great in his role . Another great surprise was Rutger Hauer . I already knew he was a great actor and it was wonderful to see him in a big production again . He plays a kind of character that suits him perfectly , a hard businessman , that also can be seen as a small villain part . There is some good action in the movie and some great fights but nothing really memorable though . I'm sure it was all very impressive to see this on the big screen but at home it all just doesn't look that impressive . I'm beginning to sound awfully negative about this movie but that's just because I simply didn't enjoyed this movie as much as everyone else seemed to had done . I feel that the movie is seriously flawed at times , mainly with its story but still I rate this movie a which by no means is a weak rating of course . It means that I still enjoyed most parts of the movie and am still anxious to see this new Batman franchise continued in the near future .
484591	1416505	70634	7.0	Not the most spectacular Dracula movies but yet it's also one of the more solid ones .	This is the eight Dracula movie entry from the Hammer studios , which began first in 1958 with the movie " Dracula " and ended in 1974 with the movie " The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires " . All of these Dracula movies are of variating quality but they all have in common that they are entertaining to watch , like basically every Hammer movie ever made . There is a bit too much talking though at times and not enough ' action ' , so to speak , though toward the ending this certainly changes . It doesn't make the movie dull or anything but still makes it feel a b bit overlong . Nevertheless the movie has a good and original enough story . The movie does a good job at putting the old fashioned Dracula character into ' modern ' 1974 ( even though the movie itself already got released in 1973 ) . This is something most modern horror movies could learn from . The story mixes the occult with the Dracula legend , combined with some modern police work . Peter Cushing once more plays a true excellent role as a decedent of the good old Abraham Van Helsing . A character he played numerous times before throughout his career . Christopher Lee also reprises his role again as the famous blood-sucking count . It would be the last time he would play the character , though he played vampire characters again in later movies . It was a real worthy last Dracula performance by him . As often the Dracula role is also really restrained in this movie . He doesn't even show up for the first time when we are already well halve way through the movie . Nevertheless its always great seeing Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing acting in one and the same sequence together . The movie besides also features a fine British supporting cast with some fine actors . The movie is well directed by Alan Gibson , who also directed the previous Hammer studios Dracula entry " Dracula A . D . 1972 " . The movie further more features some wonderful editing and camera-position at times , like you would expect from an ' 70's movie . Also surprising good was the musical score by John Cacavas , that suits the movie real well . The movie knows to create a good and also certain tense and mysterious atmosphere . It adds to the reason why this movie is such a perfectly watchable one . It surely a movie that entertains withs story , characters and actors which are portraying them . A great Hammer movie !
484193	1416505	35169	7.0	Good but certainly not the best the genre has to offer .	This type of movies were very popular in the late ' 30's and early ' 40's . Lots of classics were made during that time period and lots of actors got launched to stardom , thanks to movies like this . However as far as ' 40's screwball comedies are concerned ; this really isn't the best movie that the genre has to offer . Sure , it's all good and fun but it's just lacking this bit of cleverness and true hilarity . Blame the script for this . Mostly these type of movies are brilliantly constructed story-wise and its main characters stumble from the one odd and hilarious situation into the other . Same is also the case with this movie but it just isn't quite all as hilarious and well flowing as you would expect . Some sequences are too long and too often the movies stays too much at the same place . This is the foremost reason why it feels as if this movie isn't always flowing that well . As an indirect result of this , some characters feel like they are being used , while others feel like they are being overused . The story often feels like it could had made its point earlier and reached what it tried to achieve much earlier . Because of this it takes awhile for the story to really get off the ground . Sure , it's still a fun and entertaining movie to watch though . It's nothing too hilarious but good enough nevertheless for more than a couple of laughs . The fans of the genre will therefore also not be disappointed with this movie . Guess I'm just not Preston Sturges ' biggest fan when it comes down to his screwball comedies . I also thought his other acclaimed screwball comedy " Sullivan's Travels " , which he made one year prior to this movie , is a tad bit overrated . Both movies also star Joel McCrea , who wasn't the biggest actor within the game but he nevertheless is a great leading man , with also the right psychics . Not really sure why he never really truly broke through like an actor . He's mostly known for his work in some early westerns . It's all good and fun but there are some better genre movies to watch out there in my opinion .
485267	1416505	74328	7.0	Good last Bernard L . Kowalski Columbo movie .	Bernard L . Kowalski was probably the most consistent director out of all the Columbo movie directors . His Columbo movies are not necessarily the best ( though " Columbo : Death Lends a Hand " is still one of my favorite Columbo movies ) but his ones are always really solid and bring out the best of the classic successful Columbo formula . It's probably also the reason why they let him direct so many Columbo movies in the ' 70's , with this movie as his last Columbo movie . 3 years after his Star Trek buddy Leonard Nimoy , William Shatner also plays in a Columbo movie , as the killer as well . He's not as good as Leonard Nimoy in it but of course still plays the role well enough . William Shatner is actually a really stiff actor . He doesn't seem to move a muscle when he's delivering his lines and when it does so it feels very forced , in a B-movie kind of way . It makes him mostly such a cult-favorite but of course at the same time is also the same reason why he has never really starred in any big Hollywood productions and is mostly an actor who is doing his work for TV productions . He and Peter Falk have some great interaction together in their sequences . Lt . Columbo as always manages to get close to his suspect and gains his trust , by letting him think he is helping Columbo with the case this time . The movie has a well written plot , with a cleverly executed murder and it uses some nice settings . This time Columbo has to snoop around the set of a popular police series , in which the William Shatner plays the main part and of course soon becomes Lt . Columbo's prime suspect . It luckily isn't one of the longest Columbo episodes though , since it also just isn't the most interesting one . Nothing too special , just simply one fine executed Columbo movie entry and a great example of why the Columbo formula was such a great and successful one .
484190	1416505	69904	7.0	Martin Landau and Martin Landau versus Lt . Columbo .	This is a well directed Columbo episode , with also some good character but the story just doesn't really know to interest enough and doesn't appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a Columbo movie . This also goes for the killer's plot to kill his uncle . It's quite simple and doesn't seem as well thought out . Perhaps this movie didn't really took itself serious enough , since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light . At least when compared to different Columbo movies . For instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief , mostly coming from the Columbo character himself . It makes the movie an enjoyable one to watch but it also gives you the feeling they sort of overdid it times , also mostly since it doesn't correspond with most other Columbo movies . The characters are good and it helps that it features Martin Landau in a double role . It's always funny to see how much different he still looked as a young man , while for instance a person such as Peter Falk hardly changed any over the years , he only got grayer . The movie also features Julie Newmar among others , who is best know for playing Catwoman in the ' 60's " Batman " life action series . It's funny how she still moves like Catwoman in this movie . Intentional or is this just her way of acting ? It's an enjoyable and good to watch Columbo movie but it also gives you the feeling that it all could had been a lot better with a better thought out script .
485333	1416505	83133	7.0	Sex kills .	Who would had ever known that this obscure little unknown horror comedy would be such a fun one to watch ! This is a real enjoyable horror spoof , from the period before spoofs even became popular . The movie is so silly with its comedy that it becomes really hilarious to watch in parts . The movie is filled with some crazy but real likable characters and some really well written comical dialog , which perhaps made me laugh the most . It's strange watching this obviously low budget production from Paramount Pictures , with obviously not the most talented or experienced people involved , both in front as well as behind the camera . It actually turned out that the reason why this movie got made in the first place was because that at the time there was a writer's strike in Hollywood ( yes , it's not just something of the present ) and in order to still release some movies and gain some money , Paramount Pictures funded a couple of non-union films , of which this was one . So under any other normal circumstances this movie would had probably never been made . It really looks and feels like an amateur made film but this is obviously also part of the reason why this movie has grown into becoming such a cult-classic in certain circles over the years . It's a real silly comedy , made in the same style as some present day popular genre comedies . So yes in a way " Student Bodies " seems really ahead of its time . The movie features mostly simple humor to enjoy and the movie obviously isn't one to take serious in any way . The movie spoofs some horror classics in parts but " Student Bodies " can still mostly seen as an original production with a story of its own . Well story . . . it's not like it's anything too great written . The movie is kept simple at all times . Unfortunately the movie sort of starts ' loosing it ' toward the end . It's a real shame , since to me it prevented this movie from being a true ' must-see ' and it made it quite embarrassingly bad to watch when the story seems to be suddenly all over the place . The movie is filled with some crazy and really funny characters but of course the one that really stands out is Malvert the janitor , played by a guy only known as The Stick . It's an amazingly odd man who is very tall and a little over one hundred pounds , so you can imaging a bit how he looks like . He's incredibly sluggish and moves around like he's made out of elastic and has no bones in his body . No one knows who this guy is , or what is real name is or what he's doing this present day and time . The rest of the actors are also all big unknowns , with the exception of Richard Belzer , although he is never shown on screen , at least not his face ( he plays the killer , known as The Breather , for the obvious reasons ) . He's a real cult actor due to his personality and the knowledge of his presence alone in this movie is already amusing . Despite not being brilliant I can still really recommend this movie and can insure you that it's a real hilarious one in a lot of parts .
485223	1416505	477348	7.0	This unfortunately ain't not " Fargo " .	This movie always has been compared a lot to " Fargo " , not just because its from the same directors but also the story and just the movie as a whole show lots of similarities . To be honest , I wouldn't exactly say that this movie is like " Fargo " at all . I wish it would had been though , since that probably would had meant that I would had liked and enjoyed the movie much better . My main problem I had with this movie was that the story and foremost its storytelling got unnecessarily complicated at times . The movie has all the right ingredients in it to make a good and typical Coen brother's movie with but some of the ingredients are not present good enough and not mixed in well enough with all of the other ingredients . It doesn't make " No Country for Old Men " as tasty as I would had hoped and also expected . After all , this movie was the big winner of the 2008 80th Annual Academy Awards , where it won Oscar's for best movie and directing . It mainly lacks some witty and subtle comedy . Yes , " No Country for Old Men " does obviously still feature this all but the movie just gives you the feeling if it all had been a tad bit more comical and not as serious , the movie would had been a way better one . It's still a superior shot and made movie though from the obvious talented Coen Brothers . It foremost also really shows how acting can really make a movie . Coen brother movie characters are of course always something unusual and unforgettable and " No Country for Old Men " also truly features some unforgettable and unusual characters in it . Of course most memorable is Javier Bardem as a serial killer with some odd weapons as choice . He deserved his Oscar . He plays his character chilling , as well as with a sense of comedy , despite the fact that his character doesn't ever show some emotion . A real great achievement from Spanish born actor Javier Bardem . But the entire movie is basically well cast with some big names such as Tommy Lee Jones and Woody Harrelson in it , as well as some unexpected choices , such as Josh Brolin and Kelly Macdonald in some roles I had never ever seen them in before but they fit and play their roles surprisingly well . The movie is slowly build up with some long shots . It makes " No Country for Old Men " also a real beautiful movie to watch , also not in the least of course thanks to Roger Deakins Oscar nominated camera-work . I would say ; beware not to expect another " Fargo " and you'll probably end up liking this movie but if it had been a bit more entertaining all it really truly would had been one of the movies of the year .
485507	1416505	100404	7.0	Good court drama .	A good court drama / thriller with all the typical cliches but also some original moments and a good ending . Courtroom movies aren't known to be exciting and " Presumed Innocent " can't be called exciting either but still it is above average mainly thanks to some good storytelling and directing . Only problem is that it at times tries to be more than a court drama , which does not always work successfully . Harrison Ford seemed to feel comfortable in his role , my only problem with him was his weird hair cut . Raul Julia was absolutely fantastic in his role and made the movie so much more interesting to me . A nice movie to watch but you have to be in the right mood for it .
484418	1416505	25316	7.0	An entertaining movie but hardly Capra's best .	Sorry to say but this movie is just a bit too overrated . Especially Capra's directing is disappointing , since it's done in such an extremely old fashioned manner for 1934 standards . Surprisingly enough he still won an Oscar for his directing of this movie though . It's definitely an entertaining enough movie to watch . These type of movies were the romantic comedies of the ' 30's , the sort of Cameron Diaz and Asthon Kutcher flicks of their time , only done with more class and better actors involved . Nevertheless it's just as clichéd and predictable though . Dozens of these type of movies got made in the ' 30's and quite frankly I just can't see what it is that makes this movie a better one than any of them . It's a boy meets girl story and of course they can't get along at first but slowly begin to like each other better and more . What makes this movie its story more special is its adventurous elements being thrown in . It's a movie that involves lots of traveling and therefor also many different characters , which mainly gives the movie its adventurous feeling , without ever really getting a big adventure . More fireworks was to be expected , especially from Frank Capra's directing . It's just too formulaic and at times even just plain poor . It's way too old fashioned for 1934 and it's one of those typical movies that features long close-ups for the dramatic moments . It's a very static made film , as if it was just a job that had to be done and no real passion was thrown into it . As could be expected , the acting is still great though , from Clark Gable and the much more unknown Claudette Colbert . They were good together and luckily shared some good chemistry , which made the movie all the more fun to watch . This was actually the movie that earned Clark Gable his only Oscar out of his career . Ironicly enough non of the actors really enjoyed starring in this movie and also lots of well known actor turned the script down and Claudette Colbert , who also received an Oscar for her role in this movie , even didn't took the trouble to attend the award ceremony at first , until hearing upon her win . Yes , I know I'm making the movie sound horrible , which it really isn't . It's basically a movie I enjoyed watching but is no way worthy of this currently high rating on here . There are way better genre movies and Capra movies , with a much lower rating on here though . There are better and more interesting Capra movies to watch out there , which does not mean that this movie is an horrible one though .
483810	1416505	117509	7.0	It deserves credit for it's style alone .	" Romeo + Juliet " is a daring movie . The idea of making a " hip " version of the classic Shakespeare story set in present time might sound strange and like a bad idea to say the last . However it works surprising well and effective and for this alone the movie and director Baz Luhrmann deserve credit . The power of the movie is in the unique style . It seems unusually in the beginning but once you are used to it you will notice how wonderful it works and makes the movie in a way an unique visual little masterpiece with wonderful sets and costumes . The acting is good . Especially Leonardo DiCaprio , Pete Postlethwaite and Paul Sorvino are great . Also the chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes is good and makes the love story work . There is a real spark between those two . Still the movie has it's flaws and at times the style is simply too much and too weird and to be honest the movie is a bit too short . Not a great movie but watchable and recommendable for its style alone .
485118	1416505	187393	7.0	The main problem already is in the movie's title .	This movie is so patriotic that it's not even funny anymore . I mean when the main character is literally fighting the English with an American flag , then you know that it can't get any more patriotic as this . Yet the movie is made with lots of profession and is still eye candy and entertaining to watch . The movie is not as heavy to watch as " Braveheart " but is still full with many epic battlefields of the same proportion . The balance of drama and spectacular scene's is fairly well and acceptable , with the exception of some needless plot lines that only waste time and the same goes for some of the characters . I have some mixed feeling about the story . The movie begins dramatic with Mel Gibson as a family man that is still coping with the loss of his wife , then it suddenly starts to focus much more on his oldest son ( Heath Ledger ) and finally for most parts on the war of independence . The way the story is told is not always good or logical . Another problem with the movie is Mel Gibson . A lot of complaints were that he played to much of the same character as he did in " Braveheart " . I experienced this the same way back in 2000 when I saw " The Patriot " in the theater . Basically what I saw was an American William Wallace fighting for freedom . But yes I must admit that now 4 years later this hardly is a complaint anymore . Jason Isaacs once again was a pleasure to watch . His character was an incredibly stereotyped bad guy but he is such a great actor with such a great villain look that he actually made the character an enjoyable villain . Biggest surprise for me was Chris Cooper . Now , I know that nobody is going to believe me for saying this but I already felt back in 2000 that this guy would some day win an Oscar , something that happened in the year 2003 for his role in " Adaptation " . The cinematography by Caleb Deschanel is wonderful and so is John Williams musical score , which both got nominated for an Academy Award along with Kevin O'Connell , Greg P . Russell and Lee Orloff for the category best sound . You'll most likely appreciate this movie much better if you are a ( patriotic ) American . For those people I rate this movie an . For everybody else this movie is nothing more as an entertaining movie without any memorable scene's or deeper meaning . For this majority I rate this movie an :
483830	1416505	473444	7.0	A family drama disguised as an epic material arts movie .	Basically in its core and essence the movie is on big family drama , in which every family member of the royal Chinese family has a secret to hide . The drama isn't really that interesting to follow and perhaps also feels overdone but luckily in between - and toward the ending , the movie has more than enough action to still give the movie pace , style and reasons enough to watch this movie . The movie is well directed , so the movie doesn't ever drag or becomes bad to watch , even though for a long time nothing is really happening in the movie . I mean basically the first 30 minutes of the movie are all about the empress having to drink her ' medicine ' daily , without much further story or character development . It are really two things that make this movie distinct itself from other genre movie ; It's action and the visual look of it . Well maybe 3 things if you also count the acting , that was really good in my opinion , though it always remains difficult to judge acting in a language that you don't speak yourself . The movie really is an epic in terms of its look but also definitely in terms of its action . The end battle toward the end of the movie that literally involves ten thousands of soldiers has an incredible epic feeling all over it . Also the action during the big battle does not disappoint and it's not just your average ' chop-work ' . But we are accustomed to this already , ever since the big success of " Wo hu cang long " . Also the much smaller fight sequences before the end battle are really good and impressive looking , with great choreography and nice weapons . It also isn't as over-the-top ( though it isn't exactly realistic either ) as in " Wo hu cang long " was the case , which is I think a positive thing . But the visual style is perhaps the most notable thing about the movie . The movie is very colorful and uses many bright colors , also mostly with its impressive looking costumes ( Oscar nominated ) . It also helps to make the movie a memorable viewing experience . I am normally not a big fan of this particular type of Asian cinema but after seeing this movie I wouldn't mind seeing more movies like it .
484285	1416505	443543	7.0	Good movie but definitely a case of style over substance .	No doubt that " The Illusionist " is one of the best looking movies of 2006 . Great sets , costumes , cinematography and such but the story left me mostly cold and in fact was quite poorly told and developed at times . So definitely a case of style over substance this one but what a great style it is . What I especially loved about the movie was its authentic feeling . The movie was made in fairly much the same style as back in the early days of cinema . Of course all of the sets and costumes and such also add to the authentic feeling of the overall movie . Neil Burger obviously has a love for the movies from the early days of cinema . I however found to be the story quite simplistic , with a love-story also done in about the same way as in the earliest movies . It's admirable but not really good and interesting enough for an 21th century movie . The story also doesn't bother to explain everything , which leaves a lot to the viewers its own imagination and assumptions . Its a good way to make a movie but in this case it just leaves a bit too many questions in the end . The movie is also lacking too much in proper tension , mystery and real surprises . I for one already exactly knew how this movie was going to end halve way through the movie . The story and overall movie also don't always get properly developed . It's like the movie is stuck at times and Neil Burger still has got a lot of learning to do when it comes down to telling a story exciting , intriguing and suspenseful . The story now just couldn't grab me , though I guess that in its core it had potential . Perhaps the movie felt like it was stuck at times because of the reason that the movie is mostly set at constantly the same locations , for most part . The movie also uses its special effects too much as a tool to tell the story with . It's in huge contrast with the authentic feel of the movie . It takes away some of the ' magic ' of the movie , since you just know its not real and not a real magic trick you're looking at . It also takes away some of the charm of the movie and its subject . The best action and intriguing aspect from this movie comes from Paul Giamatti as Inspector Uhl , though his character really doesn't get developed in the best way possible . His character constantly changes during the movie . At times you like him , at times he's more the villain and at times he just confuses you what his motivations are . Nevertheless , Paul Giamatti is absolutely fantastic in his role and he also shows how incredible versatile as an actor he is . I wouldn't had mind him seeing being nominated for an Oscar again for his role in this movie . But of course opposing is Edward Norton who also does more than a great job as the main character of the movie . But before I'm starting to sound too negative ; " The Illusionist " is definitely a movie worth seeing , that however is too weak and simplistic to also consider it as one of the best movie in recent years , like the current rating here at the moment might suggest it is .
484997	1416505	265666	7.0	Not nearly as fun as I had hoped it would be . Still an enjoyable movie to watch .	No I'm definitely not a Wes Anderson fan ( even though I certainly get and understand his style ) and I'll probably never become one . You'll either just hate his movies or just totally love it . I saw " Rushmore " and though I enjoyed it , I certainly did not loved it . " The Royal Tenenbaums " seemed like a more enjoyable and completely humor filled movie , so I decided to give it a chance . Just like " Rushmore " I enjoyed watching the movie but I wasn't always exactly fully amused and the movie did not always entertain - or was fun enough . The movie is filled with some eccentric , quirky over-the-top characters , set in a normal world . The characters are weird but they're certainly not funny . Not any of them is ever given something interesting or fun to do in this movie , which seems to be a waste , considering when looking at the cast of the movie . Ben Stiller is holding back and Bill Murray is given too little screen time to become an interesting or hilarious character . Guess that the movie also has way too many characters in it , which does begin to work distracting from each other after a while . The comedy and humor of Wes Anderson movies is always in its little and subtle things . Each sequences is carefully crafted and fully thought out . Every time you watch this movie you'll discover new fun small things set in the background or a small piece of dialog or character behavior . So I definitely understand and appreciate Anderson's style but yet I just don't enjoy it as much . Just not my type of movie and style of film-making . The entire movie is made in intro-style . So scene's rapidly follow each other and everything is build up and break down again in basically 5 minutes time . To me this is a very tiresome way of film-making that doesn't work amusing enough for me . It's good at first but it's starting to get old already after a while . Saving grace for me was Gene Hackman . He certainly added some style and power to the movie as the rude and not so subtle father of the family . In my opinion he also was the true main fun thing about the movie . Even more fun and hilarious than Bill Murray in the movie . I think that says something about the entire amusement level of the movie as a whole . In all honesty the movie did entertain me and this was mostly because of the little subtle things in the movie . As a whole , so with the characters , style and story included , the movie just didn't strike me as an perfectly amusing one . But most likely the Anderson fans shall not complain .
485251	1416505	51337	7.0	Some good old fashioned Harryhausen fun .	This is a perfectly fun and adventurous movie to watch , focusing on the adventures of Sinbad . It's of course a movie that mostly distinct itself through its Ray Harryhausen stop-motion effects . The movie features a giant cyclops , giant killer birds , a dragon and a fighting skeleton . Basisicly every Harryhausen effect and type of monster used in this movie got later reused in the much better known " Jason and the Argonauts " from 1963 . Another thing that stands out in this movie is the musical score by Bernard Herrmann . It's a real fantastic and perfectly adventurous score , that is worth searching out . It's an at times quite silly and certainly outdated movie to watch now days but that has of course by now become all part of its charm . It of course isn't a movie with the best or most clever written and constructed scripts but it's a movie that relies purely on its adventurous aspects . It's also a fairly fast paced movie , that features plenty of ( mostly Harryhausen-monster - ) action . It because of that also becomes a fun and entertaining movie to watch . Unfortunately the acting isn't much good in this . This is of course also due to it that the acting by todays standards feel very outdated but even with this in mind , the actors just weren't among the best of their time , with the exception maybe of Torin Thatcher who plays an enjoyable villain . Kerwin Mathews was a sort of a disappointing and boring main hero . He also wasn't the greatest actor , not even for genre movie standards and his career also ended by 1978 , after appearing mostly in B-horror and science-fiction flicks in his later days , though he himself lived till 2007 . Some good old fashioned adventurous entertainment !
485518	1416505	20489	7.0	In bed with Laurel & Hardy .	Perhaps it's because that this movie is probably the Laurel & Hardy short I've seen most in my life that I got sort of tiresome of watching it but I don't find this movie to be the most hilarious or best constructed and executed Laurel & Hardy comedy short around . But you know , when you watch this movie objectively just for what it is , so not necessarily as a part of the Laurel & Hardy shorts alone you have to conclude that this is a pretty entertaining and fun little movie . The movie its premise is extremely simple and gives both Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardsy to let their comical talents shine , since they're basically the only two actors in the movie , except for the last couple of minutes in which Laurel & Hardy regular Charlie Hall , among others , shows up as the landlord . The comical routines are rather simple but I guess they are effective enough , since they surely amuse . It just isn't the most hilarious or imaginative Laurel & Hardy comedy around but that doesn't of course mean that this movie is bad or not entertaining .
484247	1416505	79073	7.0	Good take on the Dracula story .	This 1979 version of Dracula is far from the best but it's also far from the worst . It has enough original touches to distinct itself from previous versions and is a perfectly watchable horror movie . This is a very dark movie . Perhaps a bit too dark at times . It does provide some good atmospheric scene's but it also distracts sometimes from what's happening on the screen . On the other hand it also does provide some good looking horror moments at times . The movie is also perhaps looking older than it truly is . The movie was made in 1979 but by the looks of it , it could had also been filmed in the ' 50's . Perhaps this was done intentional as a sort of homage to the Dracula Hammer movies ? Anyway it wasn't necessary and it makes the movie look a bit outdated already . The story is good and original but it does has its flaws . The Jonathan Harker and Renfield story lines are heavily underdeveloped in this movie . The movie has a good opening and ending but the first part of the movie might be perhaps a bit slow and dragging at times . Only from the moment Van Helsing appears in the story , the movie truly becomes interesting and begins to take pace . Frank Langella is a good actor but he doesn't have enough charisma as count Dracula . There were some good scene's between him and Laurence Olivier though , who played Van Helsing . Laurence Olivier is a fantastic actor and he puts lots of class in his character . Also the fact that he spoke with a Dutch accent and actually even spoke some Dutch words ( Van Helsing is a Dutch character after all ) delighted me . As a Dutchman I can tell you that he did a very good job creating a English-Dutch accent . The way he pronounced some of the words was spot on ! Dutch wasn't a weird language to him anyway , he already played a Dutch speaking character in Richard Attenborough's " A Bridge Too Far " , two years earlier . Also great was Donald Pleasence in his role as Dr . Jack Seward . Truly a wonderful supporting cast ! The cinematography by Gilbert Taylor was simply wonderful at times and the musical score by John Williams was totally fantastic ! It truly uplifts the movie and makes the movie feel and look better than it truly is . Seriously , without John Williams his musical score I would had rated this movie an 6 instead of an 7 . A good and original enough take on the Dracula story ! For the fans simply a must see .
483869	1416505	120832	7.0	A joy for the De Palma fans , for most others it's just another confusing thriller .	Just like with " Femme Fatale " was the case , the opening sequences of this movie is more legendary than the actual movie itself . The opening sequences of this movie lasts for about 13 minutes . It seems like its one big long take but there are some hidden cuts in it . Most people that are really into movies will notice some of the cuts . De Palma uses some good editing tricks and crafty cinematography . It also makes the opening the highlight of the movie . Of course you can wonder if its really wise and good for a movie to have its best moment in the beginning . Everything that comes after it just doesn't match up to it and it might very well be the reason why this movie disappointed many people . I really like it how the same events are told throughout the movie from different viewpoints . It sheds now light on the truth and helps to unveil the story and plot . That's some great film-making ! It also makes the movie a very original one in its sort . Yes , the movie gets at points hard to follow , mainly because it isn't always credible what's happening on the screen . Nevertheless , I remember the first time I saw the movie that the twists in it surprised me and the story was a great mysterious one . Nicolas Cage and Gary Sinise are really strong actors in this movie . It takes some skill to handle all those long scene's without messing up and staying consistent . Especially Gary Sinise is great but I think that Nicolas Cage is also under-appreciated in his role . You are supposed to sort of dislike him , I mean he really isn't a clean cop , and that's what I like about the character and Cage's his performance . I also enjoyed the musical score by Ryuichi Sakamoto . It's totally overblown and out of proportion but it suits the movie and its style really well . Same of course goes for the cinematography . It's basically a very stylish and originally made movie , like you would expect from Brian De Palma . It's obviously not his most expensive movie because most of the movie is set at one location and it also isn't the longest movie around . It makes this an enjoyable ' small ' De Palma movie that's also perfectly watchable for the general public . The movie is made in the sort of style they also used to make ' 40's movies in . I especially like the use of shadows in this movie . De Palma is , as far is I know of , the only director who can successfully implement ' 40's movie-making style into modern film-making . It's a good looking movie with a style that captures you and sort of makes you forgive the inconsistencies and flaws in the story . However if you also look beyond this style you'll notice that the story and its thriller elements are all quite standards and nothing really really . Just the way it all is dressed is new ! So yes , it's a case of style over substance , like often is the case with De Palma movies . But as a fan I really aren't complaining about this ! Most recommendable to the De Palma fans but other people should also be able to appreciate the style and craftsmanship of this movie .
484414	1416505	54469	7.0	Begins as a typical teenage comedy but soon starts to become more than that .	To be honest , the movie began as a typical - and not so great , teenage comedy flick , in which a couple of youngsters are going on a spring break holiday . " Where the Boys Are " however handles delicate themes delicately and the movie is way more than just another teenage comedy . Actually quite amazing considering that this movie got made in 1960 . The movie and its theme seems far ahead of its time . It makes the movie all the more relevant for the time period it got released in and all the more interesting now days to watch . This movie is basically a good observation of how teenagers handled sexual themes in 1960 , without ever getting raunchy or not honest . It's a straightforward flick with its theme but its style ensures that this movie at all times mostly remains an entertaining and light one to watch . The movie also really doesn't feel like it was made in 1960 . It's an all the more interesting movie since it tells the story from the viewpoint of the female characters , which works refreshing for a change . The movie knows to create a perfect balance between its more serious moments and its entertainment value . With movies like this the drama would often feel forced and out of place since the entire movie is done in a comical style of film-making . The creators of this movie however managed to find the right balance , without ever crossing any lines . Above all things it's still a very entertaining movie to watch . It's still mostly a comedy that provides some good entertainment and has some likable characters in it . The characters are also really a reason why the movie works out . Lot of the characters are very stereotypical but luckily the actors don't go over-the-top with their roles , which ensures that we can also really start to like - and feel for some of the characters . The acting was way better than expected . Paula Prentiss really impressed me , also with her beauty and the movie further more features George Hamilton and Frank Gorshin in some early roles . Gorshin is still perhaps best known for his portrayal of the Riddler in the early " Batman " series . A surprising and fresh movie that deserves to be seen by more .
485023	1416505	407304	7.0	Could have been a real classic but is an above average alien-invasion movie instead .	This movie had huge potential . Everything to make this a science-fiction classic masterpiece were present ; Spielberg's directing , a great concept , ILM special effects , Tom Cruise as the main character and lots of other professionals involved both in front and behind the cameras . Then where did it go wrong ? The answer to that is the script . The story is very simple and lacks a real clear plot line . Basically the movie is only about Tom Cruise and his two children running and driving from city to city , from the aliens and their destructive Tripod-machines . Exactly why are we , out of all the people , following these persons ? The character development is lacking , just as much as the story does . Both lack development and depth . Of course the movie is by no means an horrible movie but it's just that the movie is a bit disappointing because of the fact that it had so much more potential . It still is a good and certainly spectacular movie to watch but it's not a movie people will still talk about in 5 or 10 years from now . The story makes this movie a bit of an easily forgettable movie that doesn't leave an huge impression afterward , even though the movie itself is pure eye-candy to watch . There is no doubt about it that Spielberg is a great director . He directs his actors in this movie very well and everyone in the movie gives an amazing performance , especially Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning . Tom Cruise for once again doesn't play the action hero . He is an average Joe instead and I think he did this in a very good and convincing . Spielberg also uses the special effects very well . He doesn't use the special effects to impress the audience as much as possible , with lots of spectacular and action filled sequences , which he could had easily had done , he uses them as a tool to tell the story with instead . The movie is purely told from Tom Cruise and his family's perspective , because of this the movie gets a very realistic feeling . We don't get to see any close-ups of the Tripods and how they destroy entire cities and fight off the American army . I like this approach . It makes " War of the Worlds " different from many other alien-invasion movies . It because of this certainly is one of the most believable and realistic alien-invasion movies , along with " Signs " . Visually there also is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie . The special effects from ILM are very impressive and look extremely convincing . The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is also simply phenomenal at times and is typically gritty , which certainly adds to the tense and realistic atmosphere of the movie . Unlike others , to me the ending didn't came really abrupt . But perhaps this was because to me the ending was already spoiled , thanks to the movie it's soundtrack , which featured the final narration of Morgan Freeman explaining how the movie ended . So I already knew what to expect . To be perfectly honest I liked the ending and I couldn't think of any other , or better way to end this movie , without losing any of its realism and credibility . I can understand how it might seem lame and sudden to most though but for me it was satisfying enough . It certainly is a movie that will receive one or two , most likely , technical Acedemy Awards . And it deserves to . There isn't an awful lot wrong with this movie but it truly is the simple story that prevents this movie from being a classic or masterpiece . I still regard this movie as one of the must sees of 2005 simply because of the movie its look and acting . You can tell by watching this movie that there was lots of talent involved , both in front and behind the cameras . Especially Spielberg's touch still makes this movie better than just the average alien-invasion movie but still not even he can prevent this movie from being a bit of a disappointment . Not his or anybody else his / her fault , simply blame it on the script .
484488	1416505	338013	8.0	Unique .	Even though unfortunately this movie was not as brilliant as the other and earlier written Charlie Kaufman movie " Being John Malkovich " it's still a great and unique watch . Still not entirely fair that this movie always have been given more credit than " Being John Malkovich " , fore this movie is surely not without it flaws . It above all things is a Charlie Kaufman . It's not necessarily a Michel Gondry movie , not necessarily a Jim Carrey movie , or not necessarily a Kate Winslet movie . It's a movie that really has a typical trademark Charlie Kaufman style all over it . A real accomplishment and what other movie writer can say a thing like that as well . This movie also earned Kaufman his first ever Oscar , while he already got nominated two times before in the past . " Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind " takes you along for a ride and takes you to a strange world , in which you know more than halve of it isn't for real . It's a dream like movie but not as far off as I probably make it sound right not . It's a perfectly accessible movie for all type of audiences . Don't be alarmed or scared off by it's art-house kind of reputation . The story is at all times perfectly understandable , even though quite some strange things are happening in it . It's an unique movie for sure , that also has a unique love theme in it . It's refreshing that it doesn't handle it romantic aspects in a formulaic way , though it also needs to be said that it's also thanks to Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet's performances that its main story and two main characters work out so well for the movie and therefore also its romantic theme . It's again one of those roles in which Jim Carrey shows that he can really act , without trying to be or look funny all of the time . Too bad a lot of people still don't see this . The movie also features some other great and well known actors beside Carrey and Winslet , such as Elijah Wood , Mark Ruffalo , Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkinson . It's a great movie with some great movie-making tricks . It's a true visual movie , with an almost constant dream like atmosphere . A lot of old fashioned techniques are being used , which are all still better looking than modern special effects and are therefore more effective , especially for this type of movie , as well . My complaint with this movie is though that its story and the way it's progressing is quite predictable all . It's not really the story that offers the movie with its most unique or greatest moments , though the writing in general still remains great , as weird as that might sound . Hopefully you will understand what I mean by this when you watch the movie yourself . Certainly a great and also definitely unique movie to watch . Especially for the Kaufman fans .
484304	1416505	91530	8.0	A feast for eyes and ears but flawed in its emotions .	" The Mission " is without doubt a beautiful movie . The visual are absolutely stunning . Most credit for that has to go to Mother Nature . The music by Ennio Morricone is a real threat , it might very well be his best work till date in my opinion . However the movie is more style than substance . The movie is lacking the emotions it needed and the storytelling misses the point at times . I wish more movies were made about the European slave trade . Movies have become an important medium of history telling over the last couple of years . These kind of stories are important and because of that more movies about it should be made . I however feel that this particular movie misses the point at times . The movie should be about the natives and their struggle against the Portugues slave traders and how they want to contain their way of live and habitat . The movie however focuses at times a bit too much on the Jesuits instead . The movie could had really been an emotionally powerful one if we the viewers actually got to care more about the natives . The movie tries to be emotional but fails because the story is brought wrongly . Robert De Niro is really great in his role even though he doesn't get that much to do in this movie . It's a bit of a waste of a great actor . Main character of the movie is played by Jeremy Irons who also does more than great . Some smaller part are played by Liam Neeson and Aidan Quinn . To be honest I wouldn't call Quinn's appearance anything more than just a cameo . I have some mixed feelings about this movie . The first - and middle part of the movie were really good and powerful however in the last 30 minutes of the movie the story concentrates on how the natives with the help of some of the Jesuits fight back against the Portogues . The first and middle halve of the movie mainly concentrated on how peaceful and beautiful the world of the natives was , it was ' On Earth As It Is In Heaven ' , so when the natives suddenly decide to pick up their weapons and go to battle , suddenly all of the respect and emotional bond that was build up in the first - and middle part of the movie is gone . Another example of how the storytelling of the movie is flawed . If the story was brought in a better way I would perhaps had been more shocked and saddened by the fact that the natives got slaughters along with the Jesuits . Don't get me wrong I liked the ending but it just didn't blend in very well with the rest of the movie . Still I rate this movie highly for the following reason . I judge this movie as a movie not as a history lesson , which it really could had been . As a movie it is good , despite its at times flawed storytelling . The visuals are really what makes " The Mission " an unforgettable and highly recommendable movie . The movie might not be as powerful but it's still interesting to watch .
485136	1416505	30287	8.0	A typical fine William Wyler period drama .	This was not a movie that I particularly liked watching ( perhaps it's just not my favorite genre ) but it simply was one fine made movie , that is effective in basically everything it tries to achieve . There is no denying it that this is a great movie . It features a strong dramatic story , in which Bette Davis plays the central character . It's a strong and independent woman for her time ( the movie is set in the 1850's ) , yet also spoiled and stubborn , who of course eventually has to pay for her deeds . Bette Davis plays a role in which she could had easily gone over-the-top with , since its a very stubborn and spoiled character but instead she plays her role more humane and realistic , which also keeps her likable . She even won an Oscar for her role in this movie . Western expert actor Henry Fonda also plays one fine role and I especially liked the work he did with the accent within this movie . The movie further more among others also features the always great Donald Crisp . Donald Crisp was never an actor who played the main lead in a movie but he always played small and humble but great roles , which also should be a reason why he got cast in so many fine and well known movies throughout his career . The same somewhat also goes for George Brent , who plays Buck Cantrell in this movie . It's a well cast movie with fine acting performances , which mostly also carries the movie . Max Steiner also delivers one fine Oscar nominated musical score for this movie . Steiner was one of the big composers from the early days of film-making for a good reason . Like basically every period movie at the time , it's a fine looking movie with some impressive sets and costumes . It's often being compared to " Gone with the Wind " due to its story , themes , time period the movie is set in and it got shot around the same time but this really ain't fair in my opinion . " Jezebel " isn't even nowhere close in the same league and epic proportions as " Gone with the Wind " and " Jezebel " is a more light and less complicated one , that has a totally different style and breaths a total different atmosphere , not in the least also since " Gone with the Wind " is a movie in color of course . A fine multiple Oscar nominated and winning movie from William Wyler .
485124	1416505	113161	8.0	When mobsters come to Hollywood .	I absolutely loved this movie when it first came out . It has an amazing cast , a pleasant light way of storytelling and a cleverly written story , featuring some great stereotypical gangster-type of characters . So , ever wondered what would happen if gangster interfered with producing Hollywood movies ? See " Get Shorty " if your curious about the result . It's an unusual original story about tough gangster put in an unnatural environment , who thinks that are making movies is the same as any other criminal activity . The movie is cleverly written with many different characters , that all follow one and the same plot line . All characters have different motivations but they are all cleverly connected to each other . The many characters often mix and meet each other in the events , which also causes all of their motivations to mix . The movie is really cleverly written and executed . It perhaps sounds like a complicated and hard movie to follow but it really is a light , great written and pleasant one to watch . The movie also works because of the many fine characters and of course the actors that portray them . Basically every character in the movie is deliciously stereotypical , from the Hollywood-producer to the stunt guy and from the successful acclaimed Hollywood actor to the mobster boss . The movie is well cast with actors that are obviously not cast because of their comical talents but purely because of their acting skills . The cast is one to kill for . John Travolta of course knows how to play a cool and likable gangster . Gene Hackman also plays one of his most fun roles as low-budget Hollywood producer , who thinks that he is going to make it big time . Danny DeVito is great as an Hollywood-actor and Dennis Farina , Delroy Lindo , Miguel Sandoval provide the good gangster parts of the movie . David Paymer also does what he can do best ; playing a guy with a hat . The movie is filled with many more well known actors in small roles , such as Bette Midler and James Gandolfini and even small cameo appearances such as Harvey Keitel makes . Also mainly due to the movie its professional cast , this is not an hilarious type of movie but more the sort of movie that has a constant pleasant and light atmosphere that will surely put a smile on your face . The comedy is more of the subtle kind , that everybody should be able to appreciate . Nothing in the movie ever feels forced , no matter how crazy and mixed up the movie and its situations ever get . As far as the ' 90's go ; this movie is about as cool as they could get . This movie was the definition of cool in the ' 90's , at the time of its release . Of course times have changed now but the movie still has an overall cool atmosphere and pleasant way of storytelling . It's a light fun movie to watch and re-watch over and over again .
485140	1416505	486185	8.0	A fine short .	All inconsistencies and imperfections aside , this is simply a fine and enjoyable short from Boris Paval Conen . Basically it's very hard to create a perfect short movie . You never have enough time to develop your characters or to set up a proper story . This means that you need to rush things in order to tell what you want with your story and movie . This times goes at the expensive of the logic in the story , which is also certainly the case with this movie . The story basically isn't explained within the movie . Time stops when a boy almost gets hit by a big truck , except for one man who witnesses it all happening . Why this happens for this one man never gets explained within the story and how certainly also doesn't get explained . I see the movie as about one that shows that everything is happening for a reason , not sure if this also was the message which the writer / director of the movie tried to send out . It's a greatly shot and beautiful looking movie , despite not being set at the most beautiful location imaginable . It's obviously not just an ' amateur ' short but all those involved are professionals within their business . Director Boris Paval Conen previously made the TV-series " De 9 dagen van de gier " , set in Rotterdam , which also was a beautiful shot movie and made Rotterdam look like New York City . Seems like he is a man who knows how to handle a visual style and to tell a story . Unfortunately he works mostly on short movies and TV projects and he hasn't found his big break through yet . Or perhaps this is also his own choice and he wants to remain as much independent as possible as a film-maker and therefore sticks to short projects instead , in which he remains in total control of . It's only 10 minutes short and it's certainly worth your time . Also if your not into ' foreign ' movies or reading subtitles , don't be scared off , since this movie features zero dialog in it .
484289	1416505	74860	8.0	A movie made great and unforgettable by its moments .	" Marathon Man " is among the most well known thrillers from the ' 70's and it's also definitely among the finest of its period . A period of many fine and classic genre movies , of which this movie knows to skillful distinct itself , with some classic moments . Let's face it , " Marathon Man " shall not be remembered for its story or any such thing . In that regard " Marathon Man " is nothing more than an average simple genre movie . It really are some of the moments in the movie that makes this such a great , classic and unforgettable one . Of course the dentist scene is the best known one out of this movie but in my opinion basically every sequence in this movie with Laurence Olivier in it is a classic one in my opinion . Such as also the sequence when he gets recognized on the streets of New York by some ex prisoners of a camp he operated in . But nevertheless , yes , it's definitely the dentist scene , that made many people afraid of dentists in real life , that forms the highlight of the movie . The sequences also perfectly embodies how the entire movie is ; atmospheric , mysterious , slow , tense and gritty . The sequence is so great because you don't understand what is going on or what the person wants . It makes the torture techniques seem even more cruel and painful to watch . Not just its moments but also the actors definitely uplift the movie . The movie has Laurence Olivier in his most villainous roles . It's a character that is genuinely scary and he is obviously based on Nazi doctor Josef Mengele . It's typically a role in which less is more . The character doesn't speak much or moves subtly around but his facial expressions always say more than enough and really all credit for this has to go to Laurence Olivier for that . But it doesn't make you forget that there are more great actors in this movie such as of course Dustin Hoffman in the main lead and Roy Scheider , one of the biggest stars of the ' 70's . It's also one of Hoffman's best known roles and for a good reason . His method actor works out great in the movie and for its story , character and overall atmosphere . What I like about the character is that he really isn't an hero but just an average guy and even a bit of loser that by change gets mixed up into this big dangerous situation . The movie shows us that it could happen to basically everyone of us . It also makes us easy for yourself to identify with the main character of the movie , which in return adds all the more to the suspense and realism of the movie . The entire movie is build up in a consistent speed and style . The movie does never accelerate , which also helps to give the movie its realistic and gritty look and atmosphere . Despite not being anything special when it comes down to its technical things , it nevertheless is a movie that is skilfully made with the right tools and persons for this type of movie . Yet another essential ' 70's viewing .
485189	1416505	25185	8.0	Simple Laurel & Hardy short but has some absolute hilarious moments in it .	This is a very simple made Laurel & Hardy short with an almost non-existent and not that great story . However the gags in the movie are absolutely hilarious and are the reason why this is one of the better Laurel & Hardy comedy shorts . It's a very consistent movie that remains funny throughout its entire running time . It has some absolute priceless visual jokes in it and a really funny ending . It's always fun to see Walter Long in a villainous role in any Laurel & Hardy movie , so this one included . He probably is also one of the reasons that makes this movie oh so fun and hilarious to watch . Also a couple of other Laurel & Hardy regulars show up again . Simple comedy short but the humor in it is absolutely priceless and its timing spot-on !
484408	1416505	443706	8.0	In the search for truth and answers .	The movie is a realistic retelling of the events involving the Zodiac killer . Crimes that as of yet still haven't been solved . The movie is told from many different viewpoints , such as the reporters that receive his letters and the police . Because of the different approaches the movie always knows to grab your attention and interest , without having to ever fall back onto some Hollywood clichés . It of course helps that the writer of the novel Robert Graysmith worked himself on this movie project for years . The story at all times is kept realistic . Some people might find it odd and distracting that the movie focuses on so many different characters and the movie doesn't really have one main character who's solving the crimes . What I loved most about the movie was that it without problems crosses 4 different decades . The movie begins in the late ' 60's , then the ' 70's and for a small part even the ' 80's and ' 90's . The atmosphere , style of movie-making is all consistent with the decade the movie is set in at the moment . The movie knows to re-create a perfect ' 60's and ' 70's look , in a very detailed and realistic way . I think this mostly explains the movie its very high budget . The movie also shows how an interest for something can turn into an obsession . It does this subtle and non-forced . I also liked it that the movie never got too personal or close with any of the characters within the movie . This type of movie could had easily been turned into a over-dramatized one , but the movie deliberately focuses purely on the one main essence of the movie ; Who is the Zodiac killer ? A question that of course gets never answered within the movie but the search for the answer alone is already a tense and exciting long process . The movie is filled with some big-name actors , such as Robert Downey Jr . I like how he always seems to play a caricature of himself . And eccentric , free-spirit , drug / drink addict . He's great in his role in this movie ! Jake Gyllenhaal has never convinced me before of being the right man - and have the capabilities of playing a main character and carry an entire movie but with this movie he comes close of showing he can do it . Other actors that give a nice performance in this movie are Mark Ruffalo and Elias Koteas , among others , while other big name actors play some very small parts in the movie , such as Brian Cox , Adam Goldberg and Clea DuVall . It's far from David Fincher's best work , but that says more something about the qualities of Fincher than about this actual movie .
485204	1416505	389557	8.0	Paul Verhoeven back to his roots .	More than 20 years after his last Dutch movie , Verhoeven returns to his native country with the movie " Zwartboek " . Of course expectations were high and people from both the Netherlands and those outside of it , who are familiar with his earlier Dutch movies , eagerly awaited this movie , probably expecting a new " Soldaat van Oranje " . With all those high anticipations , which also must have putted lots of pressure on Verhoeven's shoulders , the movie could only disappoint , like unfortunately too often is the case by ' hyped ' and highly anticipated movies . To most professional Dutch movie critics this movie was a slight disappointment , probably expecting way too much of it . Granted that " Zwartboek " does have its flaws but overall this movie surpassed my expectations , mainly since the movie is a well balanced mix of Verhoeven's earlier Dutch work and his later Hollywood works . It provides the movie with an unique and straight-forward as ever style with lots of spectacular and entertaining moments and some fine acting . Make sure not to expect a new " Soldaat van Oranje " like movie and you'll be able to enjoy and be impressed by the movie for what it is . To be honest the movie didn't started off well . The beginning is messy , with way too much happening on screen in a too short amount of time . It's unclear were the movie is heading to and what for a kind of movie it is going to be . There isn't a main plot line which doesn't help to make the movie interesting or easy to watch . Luckily the second halve is much better and completely blew me away . I really didn't expected to see so much action and tense and spectacular moments . The movie starts of as a typical Dutch WW II drama but quickly turns into a spectacular action / thriller with moments that really impress . I like Paul Verhoeven movies , both his Dutch as his Hollywood movies , for several reasons . One of them is that he can always tell a dramatic and powerful story in a heavy impressive but yet also always entertaining way . His movies always have one or multiple messages in it but they are disguised so well into the story ( also kudos to Gerard Soeteman for that of course ) that is doesn't ever get distracting or feels overdone and preachy but still it works unconsciously effective and powerful nevertheless . Another reason why I love Verhoeven movies is that he's never afraid to show the dark side of people . " Zwartboek " teaches us that nothing in this world is completely black and white and not everything and everyone is completely right or wrong , good or bad . Despite the movie its beginning , the movie is well written with some good and interesting characters in it . The story takes some great thriller kind of twists and turns , which also both helps the drama and action moments work out . It has some misses but overall it has way more hits , which makes " Zwartboek " probably not the best Dutch movie since years but certainly the most interesting and surprising one . The fact that the story is completely told from a woman's point of view makes the movie all the more powerful and believable , as well as unique and interesting . Had Verhoeven not worked in America for several years , this movie would had had a completely different look and style . Verhoeven his ' Hollywood ' style can be found back in this movie . Mainly of course in its action but also mostly in its professionalism in terms of directing style , camera-work and pacing . " Zwarttboek " probably is more ' Hollywood ' than ' European ' in terms of style and storytelling , which should mean that persons who aren't familiar with European movies should be able to enjoy this movie as well . Also still Verhoeven's own unique distinctive style in this movie is notable , meaning lots of nudity , sex and graphic violence but it all serves a purpose and therefor doesn't feel overdone or unneeded . The acting in this movie is top-class , from both the Dutch actors as well as the Germans . Every well known and respected Dutch actor stood in line to work with Verhoeven on his first Dutch movie since several decades . Verhoeven gratefully took advantage of this and the movie is filled with some of the best Dutch actors around at the moment . People from the Netherlands already knew it but now the rest of the world also knows that Carice van Houten is one great actress , with a great charisma and look . She carries the movie for most of its time and does this in an highly convincing and impressive way . This movie surely means her internationally breakthrough , at least if she is up for that . She further more has a great chemistry with basically every of her fellow actors in this movie , especially with Sebastian Koch and Halina Reijn . Actors in this movie who were also really good were Thom Hoffman and Derek de Lint and German actors Waldemar Kobus and Christian Berkel . Johnny de Mol however feels out of place and he plays an highly unconvincing character that only works distracting . The movie is really professional and good looking , despite its very low-budget ( even though its the most expensive Dutch movie ever made ) . The great cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub gives the movie its own identity and great look . The movie looks especially professional with its action . For some reason action and shoot sequences never look convincing in Dutch movies but this movie is a glorious exception . Will " Zwartboek " win an Oscar for best foreign film ? As much as I want to see Verhoeven finally win an Oscar and get some recognition , I don't think it will win . " Zwartboek " is probably too spectacular and ' Hollywood ' for that . I think that the academy would prefer a more heavy drama with a more serious told story , that is more powerful than entertaining . More entertaining and impressive than powerful but a fine sweet surprise nevertheless that honestly surpassed my expectations .
484109	1416505	71408	8.0	Atmospheric retelling of the Ed Gein story .	Even though all of the character names within this movie are changed , most likely for legal reasons , this movie tells the story of one of the most infamous killers of all time ; Ed Gein . Of course some changes are made within the movie and the movie doesn't tell the whole story of Ed Gein but overall in its main lines it can be considered a fairly accurate movie . Ed Gein is of course a real interesting killer because of the very odd things he did , not as much to his victims but more because of the fact he was also a grave-robber who dug up his own deceased mother and took her into his home again . He dug up several more recently deceased middle aged woman , who resembled his mother in order to use their skin to patch up his mother's body with . He became real fascinated with anatomy and that of the female body in particular . He became so fascinated he wanted to become a woman himself and he made ' suits ' out of the skin of deceased women , which he could wear . He also made various other objects from parts of death bodies . A real amazing story , which inspired many film-makers over the years . This makes it all the more odd that there never really have been a good decent Ed Gein movie around . This one is probably the best one to watch out there , even though it changed all of the character names and it doesn't focus entirely on the life story of Ed Gein . There of course was a lot wrong in Ed Gein's life and inside his head in particular but this movie does not choose to waste much time on showing how he became the man he was and what drove him to his actions . It simply concentrates on the relationship he had with his mother and how she influenced his life entirely even long time after her death . This movie doesn't try to be overly complicated and a real thoroughly character study of a serial killer . This is what makes " Deranged " an easy to grasp and watch movie . It also makes it a ' pleasant ' one , since it's also definitely a movie with a certain quirky kind of sense over it . You know , come to think of it , I think the Coen brothers would be the perfect candidates to make a story about Ed Gein's life . Also a real strong point of this movie is its atmosphere . This movie obviously was an ultra-low budget one , which works out actually quite well for the movie its atmosphere and overall realism . I honestly doubt this movie would had been better , had it had a multi-million dollar budget . One thing a multi-million dollar could had given the movie though would be some better actors to play the movie its roles . With all respect but none of the actors within the movie are among the most talented ones . It's true that it adds to the certain quirkiness and ' fun ' of the movie , also since the movie obviously doesn't attempt to conceal it isn't the most professional movie ever made with the most talented actors involved . The movie also doesn't really show any of the killings or how Gein ( or in this movie Ezra Cobb ) skinned any of his dug up bodies and how he made items out of them . So if you're expecting a bloody and gory ' 70's horror flick this is not the movie for you . It's not an exploitation flick and in that regard this movie is also really quite original for ' 70's standards . A really recommendable , atmospheric , little low-budget retelling of the Ed Gein story , that you give a go .
483845	1416505	48960	8.0	An adventure of great proportion !	The thing that surprised me about this movie was how big this production was . Thousands of extras and costumes and dozens of cameo's in a trip around the world . Unfortunately the movie has lost some of its power throughout the years . It is beginning to get outdated and it almost seems like a miracle these days that this movie has won 5 Oscar's including the one for best picture in 1957 . Especially the pace is outdated , there are some endless long scene's that just don't seem to end and go on and on . The movie is filled with cameo's ( the first movie ever ) . But I'm ashamed to say that I hardly recognized anyone . We are talking about 1956 here , those who were big stars back then are now long since gone . The only one I recognized was Sir John Gielgud , no I even didn't recognized Frank Sinatra or Marlene Dietrich . David Niven was in his element and was a great leading man . I can't say that I'm completely happy with the casting choice of Cantinflas as Passepartout but fortunately it doesn't ruin the movie in any way . The story is great and adventurous , there are countless fun and entertaining moments in this epic production .
485482	1416505	335266	8.0	Character comedy .	This movie is an unique movie that I would describe as a ' character comedy ' . This is not a comedy with forced humor in it , it is a comical , yet ordinary observation of two different people in a strange foreign world , who are growing more and more towards each other . The humor and warm feeling of the movie is in the every day things and the strange but yet realistic characters . This movie is just like real life ; slow and not every thing is always making sense or requires explanation . Sometimes things just happen , whether you like it or not . This is a movie that relies heavily on its two main characters played by Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray , two totally different characters who yet are ' attracted ' to each other . It's obvious that at lot of parts in the movie moments were improvised , especially in the Bill Murray sequences . But somehow director Sofia Coppola manages to restrain Murray ( something that most definitely is not an easy thing to do ) and molds him into the character she want him to be . The fact that Murray perhaps plays the role of his life is thanks to Coppola's directing . Coppola and Murray should definitely make more movies together in the future . It's logical that this movie received an Oscar nomination for best picture , since this type of movie is new and yet works so well and feels so familiar and honest . I'm sure of it that in the near future we will get to see more movies like " Lost in Translation " being made . Perhaps not the must see everyone makes you believe it is but still an unique , warm movie experience that surely is recommendable for everyone to watch , at least once . Chanches are you'll either end up totally loving it , or hating it .
484527	1416505	40522	8.0	A hard weekend in town .	This movie can be interpreted and viewed in many different ways . Most people praise the movie for its father-son relationship in it but to me the movie was an adventure through town , in which the main character encounters the many different social layers of post-war Italy . after his bicycle got stolen and he spends the entire weekend looking back for it , since he needs th bicycle or else he'll loose his new job . It basically is a great and honest portrayal of life in post-war Italy for a common man , who tries hard to find and eventually keep his job , to support himself and his family . It's not a movie that tries to bloom things or follows the usual standard common rules of cinema . It's an early neorealistic movie , in which director Vittorio De Sica used only amateurs to give a realistic and honest portrayal of life . It's a great social and character study . Through his travels through town he visits all kinds of places and meets people from the different society layers . A great study of post-war Italy . The main character himself also isn't without his flaws , which can also be seen back in the father-son relationship within the movie . It's a real honest and straight-forward movie that also shows how far some people are willing to go to get what they want . A great character study . But yes I do agree that the movie is perhaps a tad bit too overrated . Sure it's great and appreciate all the movie tried to achieve but it also isn't an easy movie to watch , due to the low pace and just not being interesting enough at times . It still rate this movie high but I don't think I agree that this movie is deserving his spot in all of the top movie-list and also don't really consider this to be an absolute must-see or classic . Having said that " Ladri di biciclette " is just a great movie . To be honest I was surprised that it got made with amateurs and some sequences were also obviously improvised on the spot . The movie really doesn't look and feel as if it mostly involved amateurs and this also really goes for the acting within the movie . Even though it perhaps is not the must-see , or influential movie , everyone wants to make you believe it is , it still is one great unique movie which most certainly is worth watching .
484875	1416505	82010	8.0	Original as well as surprisingly effective horror / comedy .	What this movie does very well , and what it is so well known for , is the fact that it perfect blends the comedy with its horror , without letting the one element weaken the other . Because for instance in lot of other horror / comedies , the comedy really weakens the horror . It makes them ineffective as scary and gory ones but this really isn't the case with " An American Werewolf in London " . Perhaps this is because the comedy within this movie is more subtle and B-movie like . The movie doesn't take itself too seriously which allows the movie its comedy to work out so effective and subtle . John Landis obviously made the movie deliberately B-movie like in parts , especially by picking not the best actors and by not giving them the best dialog imaginable . It on top of that features some great typical B-movie like moments , which perhaps is only truly notable for the genre fans and most other people will probably write it off as lame and simplistic . Just because the movie features humor and has B-movie elements in it doesn't mean that this movie is ineffective as an horror movie . In that genre this movie also really stands out . It does this by featuring some great imaginative and gory looking sequences . but it also does this not in the least with its make-up effects . Especially the dream sequences within the movie are quite memorable . This movie was actually the first to receive and Oscar for its make-up . Before this , best make-up wasn't even a category at the Oscar's , believe it or not . But thanks to this movie the academy realized that this was a profession to take seriously and to include in the award ceremony . The award of course went to legendary make-up artist Rick Baker . It was the first out of 6 Oscar's he has so far received during his career . The movie is actually surprisingly gory . It's just not something you would expect from an horror / comedy but this movie is basically just as gory , if not gorier , than most other ' serious ' genre movies . Director John Landis actually now days is surprised how gory this movie actually is when he looks back at it . Of course the movie doesn't feature a too complicated plot ( luckily so ) but it nevertheless know to pick an original approach with its story and all . It doesn't feature an usual werewolf plot in which the victim is battling his transformation during full moon and is plotting to kill the werewolf that bite him in order to lift the curse . I won't tell what the actual plot of the movie is , since it will probably spoil to much but fact is that it's original , which also means that the movie doesn't end in a typical ' Hollywood-way ' . When watching this movie it actually becomes more painfully obvious how bad its sequel " An American Werewolf in Paris " , which got made 16 years ( ! ) after this movie , actually is . It tries to achieve the same thing as this movie , by picking the same type of approach but in moments like that it becomes obvious that directing is a real important job and that some directors are simply more talented than others . Anthony Waller just obviously ain't no John Landis ! John Landis would also later impress with the legendary Michael Jackson video-clip for the hit song ' Thriller ' . The special make-up effects again came from Rick Baker . The clip definitely shows similarities to this movie in especially its style . A great as well as enjoyable unique werewolf movie !
484050	1416505	376968	8.0	A well made and beautiful looking drama .	This is a Russian drama made in the same minimalistic style as some of the best Scandinavian dramas . It's a slow moving movie with a realistic approach of both the story and characters . It makes the movie and its emotions and characters all feel real . With an approach like this and the right director at the helm , you don't really need much else to make a great movie . Andrei Zvyagintsev seems like a great talent and I look forward to seeing more movies by him . The story and the premise is actually quite simple but the execution of it gives the story some deeper emotional - and also realistic layers and makes the story come across way more interesting and intriguing than it is on paper . The movie is also definitely helped by its natural performances from the actors . Especially the two kids in the movie Vladimir Garin and Ivan Dobronravov are great and are the core of the movie . Everything involves around them and they carry their roles with great responsibilities in a real great way and with devotion to the characters . The movie is not only well directed and acted out , it also is beautiful looking . It shows that Russia also has some beautiful looking landscapes and nature . The movie is real eye candy to look at at times and almost looks like a painting . It's definitely true that the movie is not always interesting and the movie does has its slower moments . Some of the sequences last too long and don't add enough to the story but for a movie like this that is always sort of unavoidable . Guess you have to be a sort of genre fan to fully appreciate this movie but basically everybody should be able to appreciate the beauty and overall greatness of this ' simple little ' movie . Let's hope more movies like this one from Russia will be made and given a global release .
484686	1416505	51790	8.0	Way too old fashioned but still better than the first , due to its more dark story .	The movie " Ivan Groznyy I " from 1944 was already made in a terribly outdated style , even for its era . " Ivan Groznyy II : Boyarsky zagovor " is no different . Sergei M . Eisenstein's style of featuring long stares and extreme close-ups worked out extremely well and effective for his silent movies but in ' talkies ' it only slows the movie down . Sure it's fine and artistically impressive looking all but it's not halve as effective as would be the case with a silent movie . Even though this movie got released 14 years after the previous movie " Ivan Groznyy I " , it still got shot at the same time as the first movie . Reason why it got released so much later was because Stalin banned it because he wasn't too happy about the portrayal of Czar Ivan IV in this movie , who's more dark side is shown and besides shows a more crazy side of him , as he slowly slides into madness . Guess we should be lucky that this movie still exists today and that it didn't got completely destroyed during Stalin's reign . Because of the fact that the movie its story and main character are much darker , the movie becomes also more interesting to watch , when comparing it to the first movie . It's darker approach also makes its old fashioned style of film-making more tolerable . It suits its story better , even though its still far from ideal . I just can't imaging people still liked watching this in 1958 , no matter how great and big Eisenstein was , who had died 10 years prior to the release of this movie . It's an interesting watch for those interested in history and for the fans of Eisenstein's work . It would had been interesting to see part III being completed but Stalin halted production and showed destroyed most of the already shot footage , since the movie once more didn't showed Ivan to his own liking and the movie was supposedly also a protest against Stalin own current regime , that showed some parallels to the tyrant methods of Ivan the terrible , as got portrayed in that movie . Already an outdated movie during the time of its production but still an artistically interesting movie to watch , that works out better than the first movie .
484407	1416505	59578	8.0	Did you expected anything less from a Sergio Leone western ?	This is a typical Sergio Leone western , with a style that made the spaghetti western one of THE genres of the ' 60's and redefined the western genre in general . " Per qualche dollaro in più " is the middle movie of the ' Dollar'-trilogy and although its not the best out of the trilogy it's of course still better than just your average kind of western ! It's a movie that's solidly written , with also some fine solid characters in it . But it of course is the directing and story-telling style of Sergio Leone that makes the movie work out so well . He takes his time to build up sequences and its excitement . This movie is really not halve as action filled as you perhaps would expect but it still is at least halve more exciting than most other westerns with lots of action in it . This says something about the effective directing approach of Leone . Of course his trademarks elements such as extreme close-ups of eyes , flashbacks , slow storytelling , gritty atmosphere and stand-offs are all present here . Lee Van Cleef plays one of his very best roles . Gian Maria Volontè also did a really good job at playing the movie its real main villain , although of course I still prefer Eli Wallach . And Clint Eastwood does what he can do best in this movie ; playing one tough but righteous character . It was also quite nice to see Klaus Kinski in this one ! And of course you can't get around Ennio Morricone's musical score . Wasn't he one of the first ever composes to give each character a main theme and motive throughout the movie , that gets featured prominently ? His score for this movie is just great and it above all really serves a purpose within the movie , which makes the score really suit the movie its story as well as the overall atmosphere . It's a movie that just gets better and better toward the ending , until it gets to its unavoidable stand-off sequence at the end , that is really exciting and memorable , once again not in the least thanks to Morricone's musical score , that actually plays a real important part during the sequence . In my opinion this movie gets nowhere close to the brilliance of " Il Buono , il brutto , il cattivo " , which is the ' follow-up ' of this movie and the last part of the trilogy , but that of course doesn't mean that this movie is a bad one ! Not at all !
484396	1416505	32551	8.0	A really well made heavy handed drama .	You know , some movies are just made as pure drama's . They are purely made to bring emotions to the screen and their heavy handed . You just know that from start till finish there will be nothing to enjoy about the movie and it is going to be as serious as it can get . " The Grapes of Wrath " is such a drama , so if you don't like heavy , serious drama's , this just ain't the movie for you to watch . Because the movie is so incredibly heavy handed and self righteous , this perhaps isn't the masterpiece everybody telling you it is but there is no denying that the movie is really well made and also features some great acting performances . But because it's such an extreme drama it often feels forced as well and causes the movie to be a long watch , even though it really isn't a that long movie . It's just a movie with a real slow pace and yes I would definitely call it boring in parts , even though lots of ( dramatic ) things are happening within this movie . It really isn't the most exciting movie to watch and therefore also not really a very effective one . Even though I could appreciate the movie for what it was , it just didn't ever grabbed me with its emotions , story or characters , no matter how very well it all got done . But no , I obviously didn't hated this movie , on the contrary really . Seriously , how can you hate such a well crafted movie like this ? Even though this movie got released in the early ' 40's it still has a real typical ' 30's look and feeling over it . The ' 30's really used to be the era of some of the best and most effective drama movies . It's a movie that obviously got well directed , by John Ford , who loved to make real ' American ' movies . His movies always have something proud and patriotic about it but without the flag waving and such . To the main crowd he is perhaps best known for the work he did within the western genre , with movies such as " Stagecoach " and " Rio Grande " under his belt . It's also a beautiful looking movie with its cinematography and sets and costumes , which really suits the time period the movie got set in . It has a really great story and amazingly enough things like this really happened back then in America . I didn't knew anything about this piece of history , so I definitely learned something new from it . It's a pretty amazing story and you would have a hard time believing it if you didn't know that things like this really happened in the past . The first halve of the movie is basically a road trip with lots of drama to it obviously , while the rest of the movie also tends to be very dramatic , when the family constantly tries to settle down where ever there is work ( and more trouble ) . Henry Fonda really plays a great role and he himself also considered it to be the role out of his career . He also received an Oscar nomination for his role . The movie also has an amazing supporting cast , with for instance fine acting performances from Jane Darwell and John Carradine . Darwell even won an Oscar for her part in this movie . It was one of the 2 Oscar's this movie received . The other was for director John Ford . Both deserved their win I would say . The movie got nominated in 5 more categories , including Henry Fonda's nomination . Perhaps not the masterpiece I was expecting , it was too overdone and heavy handed for that but nevertheless one great movie , that I surely appreciated watching .
484389	1416505	24028	8.0	James Cagney goes on the dancing tour .	James Cagney is best known for his tough characters - and gangster roles but he has also played quite a lot ' soft ' characters in his career . This musical is one of them and it was the first but not the last musical movie Cagney would star in . Cagney is even doing a bit of singing in this one and also quite an amount of dancing . And it needs to be said that he was not bad at it . He plays the role with a lot of confidence . He apparently had some dancing jobs in his early life before his acting career started to take off big time , so it actually isn't a weird thing that he also took on some musical acting roles in his career . He obviously also feels at ease in this totally different genre than most people are accustomed to seeing him in . The movie is directed by Lloyd Bacon , who was perhaps among the best and most successful director within the genre . His earliest ' 30's musicals pretty much defined the musical genre and he also was responsible for genre movies such as " 42nd Street " . His musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedy like than anything else really . ' 30's musicals never were really about its singing , this was something that more featured in ' 40's and later made musicals , mainly from the MGM studios . As usual it has a light and simple story , set in the musical world , that of course is also predictable and progresses in a formulaic way . It nevertheless is a fun and simple story that also simply makes this an entertaining movies to watch . So do the characters and actors that are portraying them . Sort of weird though that that the total plot line of the movie gets sort of abandoned toward the end of the movie , when the movie only starts to consists out of musical number routines . The musical moments toward the ending of the movie are also amusing and well done , even though I'm not a too big fan of the genre itself . Once again the musical numbers also feature a young Billy Barty . he often played little boys / babies / mice and whatever more early on in his career , including the movie musical " Gold Diggers of 1933 " , of one year earlier . A recommendable early genre movie .
485164	1416505	240772	9.0	Great cast and script !	" Ocean's Eleven " is a very fun and stylish heist movies with a wonderful cast and clever script that provides more than enough surprises and fun twists . The movie is just mainly fun as it is meant to be , it is no Oscar material or anything . I think Steven Soderbergh ( who also wrote and did the cinematography for this movie ) really used his big name to get together such a great cast with big names such as : George Clooney , Matt Damon , Brad Pitt , Julia Roberts , Elliott Gould and Andy Garcia . All of the actors portray some fun and enjoyable characters . Characters such as Yen , Virgil and Turk Malloy and Basher Tarr , which are the most enjoyable . If you liked " The Italian Job " ( 2003 ) you'll love " Ocean's Eleven " . Hopefully " Ocean's Twelve " will be just as good , or maybe even better .
484780	1416505	87544	9.0	A magnificent imaginative movie .	This movie has an absolutely magnificent imaginative story . The movie perfectly creates an unique post-apocalyptic world with some wonderful settings and strong characters . The movie is filled with some wonderful and certainly unique moments . Really the best element of the movie is truly the story . I have to admit that in the beginning I wasn't exactly grabbed or fascinated by the movie its story , characters and settings . However as the movie progressed I got more and more drawn into the movie and its story and characters and the unique world the movie was set in . The second halve of the movie , when the real action begins and the story takes more form , is especially extremely good . There are some fine action - and tense moments in the movie and the ending is build up very well and is truly both spectacular and adventurous to watch . Kudos to Hayao Miyazaki ! There are some really good characters in this movie . Princes Nausicaä is a strong heroic female lead and the movie features some good sidekicks , such as characters that provide comical moments , the wise man Yupa , who in several ways resembles Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings and of course the villains who are often so important in movies like this one . It are all very stereotypical characters who work very well for the movie its story . The characters are build up nicely and because of that they work really well for the movie . The movie is an beautiful unique and wonderful experience to watch . It's spectacular , imaginative , powerful and beautiful all at the same time . It's truly something you have to experience for yourself ! It's no surprise that I can whole-heartedly recommend this movie to everyone . You don't have to be into anime movies , to be able to appreciate and enjoy this movie . Be sure the watch the original Japanese , 116 minutes version of the movie though , for the most optimal movie experience .
483825	1416505	206634	9.0	What an incredible realistic looking movie .	At the beginning of the movie I was quite worried . I thought ; Oh no , not another movie about a depressive , cold and ugly looking future , in which a common man grows out to be a hero . For the first 30 minutes it really felt like the movie was heading in that direction . Later the movie starts to take a positive turn when the movie becomes less plot orientated and instead turns into an almost documentary like observation of the events happening in the movie . It helps to give the movie its really realistic feeling . The strength of the movie is in how how incredible authentic it all looks and feels . It helps to make the movie make a big impact on you . The movie will probably glue you to the screen for at least its last , really impressive looking , final 30 minutes or so . Even despite its weaker more formulaic opening this movie as a whole knows to totally grab you and leave a really lasting and powerful impression . The camera always stays with the main character , which allows us to see the things as he sees them . I really liked this approach , since it made the movie feel really realistic and puts you right in the middle of everything . You really feel that you're a part of this movie while watching it . This works especially great toward the ending of the movie when the action begins and it really starts to feel like you're watching a war-documentary . The movie features many long shots that at times go on for minutes . This also works great for the movie its realism and it makes sure to grab you and put you right in the middle of things . It provides the movie with some great made and looking moments that are memorable , for sure . Also of course the visual style of the movie adds to the authentic feel of the movie . The Emmanuel Lubezki cinematography ( Oscar nominated , in a great year for cinematography ) is most excellent . The movie subtlety shows ' the future ' , so no flying cars or ray-guns in this movie . There are only small changes in the future and more subtle things such as the way we talk and society lives with its - , almost as if it has accepted , violence . I also like the way animals play a subtle role in this movie , which use can be interpreted in many different ways and some other small elements and references in the movie that have a deeper meaning in it . Yes , the future in this movie is dark , depressive and about a hopeless situation but the movie doesn't do anything to exaggerate it . Also again a reason why this movie feels so incredible realistic . I don't necessarily see " Children of Men " as a warning for the future but more as a persons vision of the future , if the world , environment and society goes on living and changing the way it does now . The movie thank goodness does not have a preachy undertone and it doesn't prominently tries to send out a message to its viewers . And is it me or is Clive Owen getting better with every movie ? What I also love about this movie is that it has a couple of other A-list actors in in it ( Julianne Moore , Michael Caine ) but the movie isn't afraid to treat them like B-list actors . The movie perfectly incorporate its action into the movie . It shows that director Alfonso Cuarón is top of the game when it comes down to action . The movie has action in it many modern action movies would be jealous of but Cuarón knows to feature its action in an humble way , despite its large scale and complexity , to let the action serve in the service of the movie and its story . An absolute essential 2006 viewing and one of the year's best .
483753	1416505	265086	9.0	" Saving Private Ryan " in Somalia .	This movie uses the exact same gritty style as used in " Saving Private Ryan " . I don't mind it , I welcome it ! For me it's wonderful to see that " Saving Private Ryan " set a whole new trend for war movies . Just like in " Saving Private Ryan " this movie tries to shock the audience , sometimes it succeeds but sometimes it also simply fails because the movie tries to hard to shock with as a result that some scene's feel forced . The characters and the event fail to get me emotionally involved , so for me this movie is more successful as an action than it is as a war movie . Like many more people my major complaint is the use of characters . They really stay just uniforms with persons in it for me . I have a hard time to remember all of the names mainly because of that they all look the same to me . The only one's I can tell apart are the one's that are played by famous actors ( Josh Hartnett , Tom Sizemore , Eric Bana , Orlando Bloom , Jason Isaacs , Ewan McGregor etc . ) I really couldn't feel for any of the characters , also thanks to it that there are some over-dramatized scene's involving some of them that just don't work for me . I was also told by a Somalian friend of mine that the presentation of Mogadishu is not completely fair . The real Mogadishu is much more modern . He also of course complaint that none of the Somali's in the movie spoke actual Somalian . But this are of course simply things that wouldn't bother any of the " normal " viewers . I admit that I expected very little from Josh Hartnett after seeing " Pearl Harbor " but I was wrong to do so , he actually can act ! It's too bad that some of the other actors are miscast such as Jason Isaacs and Orlando Bloom but biggest miscast was Ewan McGregor . He and his character really felt out of place . I'm beginning to sound extremely negative about this movie , while in fact it is far from bad ! The action really is top class ! Also thanks to the cinematography and the unusual but very effective musical score from Hans Zimmer and friends . Far from flawless war movie but a very good action movie !
484503	1416505	25913	9.0	Something beautiful for something horrible .	No matter what Leni Riefenstahl claims , this movie is just pure propaganda for the NSDAP . Seriously , if it wasn't supposed to be propaganda , the movie would had been edited in a totally different way . Everyone with common sense sees this is pure propaganda . Horrible yet beautiful propaganda . The movie is historically important and for the WW II buffs among us because of that simply a must see . It's about the Sixth Nuremburg Party Congress , 4 years before the real beginning of WW II . What we get to see is a display of power and race supremacy . It's really impressive to see literally hundreds of thousands of different SS and SA soldiers all marching perfectly in columns while holding flags and a military march is playing . The precision and perfection is scary to see , just as it is scary to see how thousands of civilians young and old all hail Hitler . Most young girls even scream like it were actually The Beatles that were visiting . Seeing and hearing all those ' normal ' hundreds of people raising their right hands greeting Hitler and his officers and soldiers was chilling to see and sends shivers down my spine . It was horrible to watch . . . Yet the movie is also in a way ' beautiful ' to watch . In an artistic way the movie is just simply wonderful . The camera-work but especially the editing was impressive . Only thing is that some moments drag on for too long . For instance the marches just seem to go on forever ( Also proof for that this movie is purely propaganda . ) . Also it was nice to see some of the ' old ' Germany . Of course most of it got bombed down later during WW II . I'm sure and hope that most people these days don't agree with him but you have to admit that Hitler was one powerful political public speaker . His speeches in this movie are both impressive as terrifying to look at and listen to . He seriously puts all the other speakers to shame like Hess , Darré , Todt and Dietrich . And although he doesn't smile or show any other emotion you can tell that Hitler was enjoying every minute of it , you can tell it by his eyes . Horrible propaganda , yet beautiful and historical important as a movie . And lets hope none of this will ever happen again .
483737	1416505	117666	9.0	Beautiful slow character portrayal .	" Sling Blade " is a movie with an incredible great main character in it . Billy Bob Thornton truly portrays a memorable movie character that delivers some memorable lines . It's a role you normally wouldn't expect to see him in . The movie has a beautiful story that has lots of heart in it . It's told in a perfect slow way , which helps to make some of the dramatic scene's really powerful . It's a depressing movie to watch , which means that it's powerful and everything in it works good . I wish more little movies like this were made . There are many long sequences with only one camera-positions that show all of the actors their fine acting skills . Thorton impressed me and he deserved his Oscar nomination . Other fine roles are played by Dwight Yoakam , John Ritter and Natalie Canerday . Some small roles are played by J . T . Walsh and Robert Duvall . Robert Duvall has a very small role and few lines but still you can tell by looking at the scene that he is a terrific actor and makes the short scene a quite powerful one . Unfortunately Lucas Black isn't the greatest child actor I have ever seen but I think it's unfair to just judge him by this movie . This movie is an incredible hard one for a child actor to play in . The main character is really the reason why this movie works and why it's so good and powerful to watch but it's the combination of the characters and the story that makes this movie a true must see for everyone .
485579	1416505	469494	9.0	The kind of movie I thought that didn't got made anymore .	' They don't make them like this anymore ' is a much uses expression when saying something about a classy ' 40's epic . " There Will Be Blood " however is just a movie like that . Appearantly there are still directors around with the talent to bring back the old feeling of a brilliant epic from the early days of cinema , with the same style and approach of things , that might seem slow and old fashioned for some people but are a real treat for the lovers of cinema . " There Will Be Blood " is a slow but real intriguing and very detailed portrayed of a man . It's like an autobiographic movie without being based on an actual person ( well , not 100 % fully ) . Just like in real life he faces some extreme ups and downs , of which the downs are of course the real interesting aspects of the movie . It's a real powerful movie to watch , even when there is actually very little happening . It's a movie made with such an eye for detail that this becomes a subtly brilliant movie . ' When ambition meets faith ' is a great tag-line for the movie . It really describes what the movie is about . It's main character is a real driven one that has aspiring ambitions but countless times he's being pulled down by events and people around him , even when things are going really well for him . He basically sacrifices his entire life , without giving his actual life , for reaching his goal . When he has eventually reached that goal life is also empty for him . The movie is a great character study of a greedy man , who of course also still has an heart and soul . Of course the movie is almost completely being driven by Daniel Day-Lewis . He for 90 % basically makes this entire movie . Without him there also truly wouldn't had been " There Will Be Blood " . Like always he really becomes the character , which is perhaps even a bit scary at times to see him get into his role so deeply . As expected he also won an Oscar for his role . Whenever Daniel Day-Lewis plays a role like this one there simply is no other competition for him . Most of the time he also completely plays all of his fellow actor from the screen in this movie , which perhaps sounds as a compliment but actually is more a bit of a complaint . He lets some of the other fine actors look bad , of which the movie doesn't benefit . Luckily though the movie is purely about Daniel Day-Lewis for 90 % of the time , making the complaint not much of a complaint anyway . But of course Paul Thomas Anderson shouldn't be forgotten . After all he is the man that had the guts to directed this movie , that isn't exactly mainstream in its core but nevertheless became a modest box office hit due to his professional skills . The movie won lots of awards , which of course wasn't just due to Daniel Day-Lewis his performance . Paul Thomas Anderson is a real talented director who really knows how to tell a story powerful , effective and intriguing , even when in its core the story might seem far from any of that . He proved this before with movies such as " Magnolia " and " Boogie Nights " . " There Will Be Blood " however still remains his most grand and epic production as of yet . It's also a real beautiful looking . The movie does a very good job at creating a very authentic look and atmosphere for the story that is set at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th . The movie is gritty and dark and has a depressing look without ever giving you a depressing feeling . The movie also really deserved its Oscar which it won for its cinematography . The movie was nominated for a total of 8 Oscar's , making it one of the big movies of 2007 . It won only 2 Oscar's though and lost out its most important awards to the hit-movie " No Country for Old Man " . A great unique movie made in the style and tradition of the movies from the ' good old days ' .
485092	1416505	465551	9.0	One of the unjustly overlooked movies of 2006 .	This is perhaps one of the most overlooked movies of 2006 . Sure , it got lots of good critical acclaim and it was even nominated for 4 Oscar's but not that many people actually went to see this movie in theaters . I'll admit that Judi Dench as an old lesbian doesn't sound like the most appealing movie but of course when you still give the movie a chance the movie and its story have much more to offer . It's not necessarily one of the best or most clever written movies of the past years but the execution of it all is just top-class . It's a quite unusual and also daring story , mainly because of its perspective and characters . It therefor at all times remain a good and interesting movie to keep your attention and interest throughout . But of course what really makes this movie is the Judi Dench character . She knows how to bend and manipulate the situation to her own advantage , only purely for her own personal gain and pleasure . It's a real disturbed character and definitely has some issues but in the movie she isn't portrayed as an insane psycho who would do anything to get what she wants , even though that still is what the story is all about . It's thanks to Judi Dench that the character still always keeps an humane side and a side that you could understand and perhaps even care for . It's a real great character for Dench to add to her impressive list of characters . This is perhaps her most villainous role out of her career . Her character begins as a quite normal one , that you even start to care for , but slowly and steadily it becomes obvious throughout the movie that this is one disturbed character . I also like how its only implied throughout the movie that the Judi Dench character is lesbian . The word is never said and nobody speaks of it . I don't know , just thought that this was a nice touch . Just let the viewers make all of the obvious assumptions without explaining everything formulaic and in simple movie telling form . Also of course the make-up helps a lot . Judi Dench really looks like an ugly old woman in the movie , though in real life she is still good looking for her age . Cate Blanchett also plays a good role . This must have been a tough role for her but she manages very well at keeping her character humane and more easy to identify with as well . Bill Nighy once more also plays a great and subtle role . His role was sort of restrained in the movie , which really was needed for the story and to not distract from the movie its main issues . I also liked how they used ' non-actor ' looking and acting persons for the teachers roles . I found the atmosphere among - and the looks of the teachers very convincing in the movie . I've actually spend lots of time in the teachers room , so I know what I'm talking about . No , I spend there not as a punishment but as work , not that there's much difference though . The movie does a very good job at creating a realistic and easy to identify with atmosphere and situations , even despite the tough and unusual subjects . It does this trough the dialog and acting but also with the help of the fine directing and story-telling , despite some flaws in it , that creates the atmosphere of the movie . It's the sort of movie that looks and feels like it all could really happen and why not to any of you ? The movie feels as if it's based on a true story , even though it's not . It's based on the novel " What Was She Thinking : Notes on a Scandal " by Zoe Heller . I also liked the Philip Glass musical score for the movie . I'm not really a Philip Glass fan in terms of that I ever sit down and listen to his scores but his scores always suit the movies and its atmosphere well . I think that's also the reason why he already has been nominated for 3 Oscar's , including for this movie . A great movie !
485277	1416505	361862	9.0	Great script and great actor make great movie .	When I first saw the trailer for this movie I just knew that I had to see it . It looked tense but above all , mysterious , original and also certainly unusual . Plus it had Christian Bale in it . I'm glad that I have finally watched this movie and it certainly lived up to my expectations . Although the story itself might not be that unique or original , for it certainly uses several elements from other movies , the story is still good and mysterious on its own . Most of the things in the movie happen as a surprise and the movie leaves you guessing till the end . Therefor the scripts still remains powerful and original on its own . It's the script that mostly is the reason why this movie is an unique viewing experience . It has more than enough surprises in it and you never fully understand what is happening to the main character . You know that it can't be some sort of large scale conspiracy plot against the main character , as the main character himself thinks . It's too complex and too many unusual things are going on for that . But what exactly is going on and why , remains largely a surprise till the end . The movie is beautifully crafted by director Brad Anderson , who also provides the movie with a nice visual style . The story is nicely told in a mysterious and mostly unusual way but never without getting too complex to follow . The movie has very few characters in it and it mostly only focuses on just the main character , so we never loose track and are fully captivated with the story and feel for the main character . The main character of the movie is being played by Christian Bale , who lost a shocking amount of weight for his role . If he was any thinner , he would seize to exist . It's a real achievement , especially considering he had to get in shape again fast after this movie , for his role in " Batman Begins " . But above all Christian Bale is just a wonderful actor . One of the discoveries of this decade and a name for the future . Of course he already received lots of fame after his role in the Spielberg movie " Empire of the Sun " from 1987 but it wasn't until the early ' 00's that he appeared in some good movies again and showed his remarkable talent and skill . He also certainly doesn't disappoint in this movie and he is good enough to basically carry the entire movie on its own . It also was great to see the actors Jennifer Jason Leigh and especially Michael Ironside in this movie . John Sharian also plays a magnificent and significant role in this movie . He's a really powerful actor with a great charismatic face . An highly recommendable movie that has plenty of surprises and will mostly leave you guessing till the end . Not the most original but certainly one of the most unique movies of this decade .
485325	1416505	161081	9.0	Excellent horror / thriller .	REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS Don't read unless you have already seen this movie . The movie is very original in many ways and not like other horror and thriller movies at all . The best thing about " What Lies Beneath " is that it keeps surprising with many plot twist and it knows how to combine the horror and the thriller elements in a most excellent way . The first 30 minutes are a stroke of genius . It starts of like an Hitchcock like thriller but after the fist 30 minutes your realize it was only a distraction and that the real story and plot is about something completely different . And yes , the movie is scary too . It has lot's of scary moments that will scare you time after time . Michelle Pfeiffer is simply brilliant and is a great leading lady . Harrison Ford also pulls of quite well , the first 1 and a half hours or so , as a good loving husband / father and the last 30 minutes as a really scary villain . It was amazing to see Harrison Ford in a villain role , it's too bad he never portrays villains because he really has a talent for it . The movie also features some great many long scene's with excellent camera work that really builds up the tension . It shows that Robert Zemeckis has a great talent for horror and timing . The best combination of thriller and horror I have ever seen with many surprising plot twist .
485537	1416505	91064	9.0	Not quite fully an horror movie and not quite fully a science-fiction movie . Instead its an unique movie experience in almost every way possible	" The Fly " is hard to classify . There never has been a movie like this before and there will never be one again , since the way of movie-making and story telling is so brilliantly unique of this movie . It's not really an horror movie , for it's not consistently scary and gory enough for that . The movie can be divided into several parts and to every part of the movie a different genre label can be put . Cronenberg simply chooses to ignore that there are different movie genres and he tries to create his very own movie with his very own unique view and take on the story . He ignores all of the ' Hollywood ' movie rules with as a result this brilliant and unique movie . The storytelling is for most part slow and mysterious . It helps to give the movie a certain atmosphere of fear and paranoia . The movie has very few settings and actors in it . It doesn't waste anytime on wide-shots , needless side-plots and characters . Instead it choices a straight forward approach . It works powerful and compelling . We as viewers get immediately drawn into the story and the ' action ' , so to speak , immediately starts of . It are all reasons why this movie is only 95 minutes short but its long enough to cover everything that has to be told . The unique way of storytelling is probably also the reason why this movie feels so realistic to watch . You just never know what is going to happen next and the characters are mostly unpredictable . The story and characters take several turns as the movie progresses . The wonderful dialog is another thing that adds to the realism of the movie . Of course the dialog is also perfectly delivered by the fine cast . Jeff Goldblum plays his character in a way only Goldblum can . With this movie he deliverers one of his most memorable performances . Geena Davis in this movie also shows that she is a very talented actress . It's too bad her career never really got of the ground , in terms of playing respectable and tough roles . She is a well known Hollywood-star but she never really appeared in any widely acclaimed and respected movie , with the exception of this movie , " Beetle Juice " and " Thelma & Louise " , for which she was nominated for an Oscar . Three years before that she even won an Oscar for her role in " The Accidental Tourist " . But having a successful 5 years just isn't enough for an actress of her caliber . A real shame because when you watch this movie it becomes obvious that the talent is definitely there . John Getz also plays a great role . He plays an unpredictable character that at moments you hate and at others you like him again . Just like in real life , none of the characters are fully bad or fully good . Everyone has a darker less pleasant side and director Cronenberg is not afraid to show this . The special effects are simple and quite poor but considering that this movie was released in 1986 , it's acceptable . The Oscar winning make-up effects on the other hand are fantastic . There are very gory . Even more gory than the most hardened horror movie . The make-up effects are one of the main reasons why the horror elements of the movie work out so very well , especially toward the ending . It's probably also the reason why this movie is regarded by many as an of the best horror movies of all time , even though the entire movie itself isn't really an horror movie at all in my opinion . It's a very well constructed movie that can't really be defined . A typical Cronebergian gem , with more layers , meanings and elements in it then you would see at first sight . Almost everything about it is unique . It makes " The Fly " a one of a kind movie that is an absolute must-see , at least if you have a strong enough stomach , for this movie definitely isn't for the faint of heart .
483985	1416505	33028	9.0	A great adventurous story !	What really makes " The Sea Hawk " good is the great adventurous story . It's filled with action , romance and adventure . A true swashbuckler . Errol Flynn really is one superb hero . Not only has he got the right looks but he also was a very talented actor who unfortunately died far too early at the age of 50 . I also love how the rest of the characters are portrayed such as Elizabeth I and the ' gentleman ' villains . Also the love story is done good in a non-distractive way and Brenda Marshall really was one beautiful woman ! Still its funny to see how much more polite the English are portrayed than the Spanish . Not only do they politely capture all the Spanish soldiers but they also find time to free all the galley slaves and take them ALL on their ship back to England . It really is funny to see how black and white the story is at times . But this is really my only small point of critic about this movie . A very entertaining adventurous swashbuckling movie with some wonderful music by Erich Wolfgang Korngold . After more than 60 years it hasn't lost any of its power and therefor is recommendable to everyone , even those who aren't familiar with ' classics ' .
485037	1416505	147612	10.0	How was this movie overlooked by the Academy ? - One of the most brilliant movies of the ' 90's .	How come that this movie was completely overlooked by most big award ceremonies ? Probably because of its controversial subjects . It's brilliantly written and directed and brilliantly acted out by its cast members . It's perhaps the most overlooked movies from the ' 90's and is on a level of brilliance I haven't seen a movie on for a long time . This is one of those movies that grabs and doesn't let go . It makes you forget the time and everything else that is happening around you . I haven't watched a movie in that way since like forever . It made " Happiness " a truly unique viewing experience that left a big impression . The movie kept me thinking for hours afterward and I could hardly sleep because of it . Here they are ; characters we often hear and read about in the papers and on TV . Characters we simply think of as being unsympathetic monsters , we don't want to spend too much thoughts about . I'm talking about pedophiles and phone sex masturbaters , among others . This movie shows that in truth often those people are nothing more than common persons , with a good job , money and a family of their own . They could be a colleague of yours , a neighbor or even a family member . A person you think you know but without ever truly knowing what is going on in their heads and what their perverted sexual fantasies and preferences are . The movie shows that these sort of things could happen in your neighborhood or somebody you know . It's shocking and confronting but of course closer to the truth then them just being cold-hearted ruthless monsters , even though the thought of it is strangely more comforting . The fact that it all are ' ordinary ' persons is far more shocking . None of the characters wants to be that way , they just ARE that way . " Happiness " does a good job at creating a realistic environment and story lines and connecting all those different lines together in the movie . The movie follows multiple different characters and therefor also story lines but the movie never gets disjointed even though of course every storyline has its weaker and less interesting moments . It also doesn't make the movie confusing or unnecessary hard to follow , like some other directors would probably have done with the story ( Alejandro González Iñárritu or Steven Soderbergh springs to mind . ) The movie instead chooses a light comedy like approach . Comedies really don't get darker than this . Despite its heavy subjects , the movie is also still fun to watch , with some great funny moments . It in a way makes the movie also more accessible to a wider range of audience . The movie is of course also truly uplifted by its fine cast . Even actors who I normally don't really like ( like Lara Flynn Boyle ) were just great . While watching this movie it made me realize something ; Philip Seymour Hoffman is probably my favorite actor at the moment . What can I say , he's just great ! I'm glad he finally won an Oscar last year . Finally true recognition for one of the best actors in the business , not just now but of all time . But it in all honesty is Dylan Baker who gives the best performance . He without doubt plays the toughest role of the movie , a married , with children , psychiatrist pedophile . He manages to make the character in a way more accessible and understandable . Especially the sequences with his teenage son , who is starting to discover his own sexuality , are greatly done and very powerful , especially toward the end of the movie . Also Jane Adams delivers a notable performance , as a ( too ) kind person who gets exploited by others because of it . The pain and inner-conflicts of the characters as portrayed in this movie are almost sensible . If you want to or not , this movie makes you look differently at the world and the sexual ' perverts ' we hear and read about . It therefor makes " Happiness " a powerful and effective , thought provoking portrayal , of real life humane characters .
484502	1416505	167261	10.0	Absolutely , totally fantastic !	Watching this movie is like watching a 179 or 223 minutes long action sequence . The pace is incredibly high . Alright I have to admit that the Extended Edition of the " The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers " takes an awful lot of this pace away and make some of the scene's unnecessary long and the scene's with Treebeard are also a bit dull and long but still . . . Especially compared to the first that was just too slow at times this is an huge improvement ! Luckily there also are some welcome additions in the Extended Edition . Best addition are the scene's with Boromir , Faramir and Denethor in Osgiliath . There also are some newly great characters and actors . David Wenham is a surprisingly talented young actor and I think it's great that they actually have cast someone that really looks like Sean Bean . Bernard Hill also impressed me , he probably is best know for his role as the captain in " Titanic " in which he also already impressed me . Viggo Mortensen probably still is the best actor of " The Lord of the Rings " movies . Yes sure Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are also more than great but Mortensen really puts some passion and effort in his character . I know Sean Astin is always being praised a lot but I seriously don't think that he is such a good actor in any of " The Lord of the Rings " movies . Andy Serkis also was really good as Gollum / Sméagol and I wouldn't had mind seeing him get an Oscar nod . Strange thing is that the Gimli and Legolas suddenly changed into some comical sidekick characters . It was odd to see but it works ! They provide some good comical relief at times . Most fantastic thing about the movie is that it's really action filled . The Battle of Helm's Deep truly is fantastic to see . Still favorite and most powerful moment of the movie is when the Ent's march to war . Also the scene's with the riders of Rohan are a true spectacle . I've never been really a big fan of the editing of " The Lord of the Rings " movies and this one is no exception . Problem is that Peter Jackson shot way too many hours of footage with as a result that the editors have difficulties picking the right scene's and the length of them . But " The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers " is one of those movies were the pluses make more than up for the minuses . A spectacular adventure action experience .
484232	1416505	108550	10.0	A movie with characters in their purest form .	In " What's Eating Gilbert Grape " we get to see different characters in their purest form . All of the characters are understandable and easy to relate to in all of their actions . It makes the emotions and drama elements in this movie feel all very real . For fans of Scandinavian cinema this movie is nothing new . Movies like this are getting made for years now over there . " What's Eating Gilbert Grape " however reaches a wider range of people and make more people see the beauty and brilliance of slow cinema , in which everything is build up very slow and the story is told like a documentary like observation of the different characters . Man and was Leonardo DiCaprio brilliant in this ! Even the most hardened DiCaprio hater should have to admit this . He is totally believable as a mentally-challenged young boy . He really stole the show . Also the rest of the cast is more than great . Johnny Depp is as good as always and Mary Steenburgen and Darlene Cates also know to impress . Yet the movie is more than just an emotional drama , it also knows how to be funny and entertaining about certain things at the right times without making the movie less powerful in any way . There really is nothing wrong with the piece of cinema brilliance and everything is simply perfect and works very well .
484348	1416505	4972	10.0	It still is the best movie about the civil war ever made .	Being far from the most politically correct or historical important movie about the civil war , it still remains the best made and told movies , especially considering that this movie was made in 1915 . The movie its story is very well told and beautiful brought to the screen . The style of film-making was truly revolutionary for its time , the reason why the movie , from a movie-technical point of view , is considered to be one of the most important and influential movies of the early 20th century . The movie can be divided into two separate parts . The first halve of the movie is about the start and end of the civil war and ends with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln ( that's not a spoiler is it ? ha-ha ! ) . The second halve of the movie focuses on the aftermath of the civil war , a subject that never ever really gets handled much in any other movie . The first halve is more serious dramatic and historical like , while the second is more over-the-top dramatic and the story becomes more fictional and also because of that more entertaining . Actually surprising to see how well the first halve of the movie was made . The movie had a couple of good looking mass scenes and spectacular looking battle sequences . Of course the movie as a whole is also beautiful looking with good sets and costumes . But the best thing about the movie remains its storytelling . The characters and drama get very well developed and the build of the overall storyline makes sure that the movie takes some epic-proportions at times . The directing from D . W . Griffith is extremely good . The second halve of the movie is controversial to say the least . It among other things , shows how and why the first ever Ku Klux Klan was brought to existence . Of course lots is exaggerated and everything in the story is extremely figurative black and white . You also have to keep in mind though , that the first Ku Klux Klan was different than the second and later forms of it . But still that's not an excuse for this movie to glorify the KKK and give them in this movie almost mythical like proportions . As a matter of fact the movie , among other reasons , caused the rise of the second KKK , in 1915 . I don't really understand why the filmmakers picked this approach and storyline . Not sure what they wanted to achieve with it . Still I'm able to look at this movie as a piece of well made early film-making . Guess that in a way the movie is a bit the same as " Triumph des Willens " , it's something beautiful , made for something horrible but you should still be able to appreciate how technically well and beautifully the movie is made , if you can remain objective and non-biased about the controversial subjects handled in it . The movie is too beautiful and well made to hate it . Perhaps the movie would had even been better and definitely had a better reputation of the movie ended after its first halve . And you can say and think about the ending what you want but it's both tense and spectacular . It also follows two separate story lines and cuts back and forth between them , which works all the more better and effective for the movie its tension . I think that this storytelling approach was also unique for its time but I have to admit that I'm not sure about that . The movie features perhaps a bit too many characters and plot lines , which does make the movie at times confusing to watch but then again , aren't most silent movie at least a bit confusing and unclear to follow at times ? It's also the reason why the movie is extremely long ( for its time ) but that of course is also depending on which version of the movie you're watching ( For information , I've watched the longest version ) . Of course the acting is terribly over-the-top by todays standards . Every emotion gets extremely exaggerated , mostly by the female cast , played by early big movie-stars Lillian Gish and Mae Marsh . Actors that I still liked in this movie were Ralph Lewis and George Siegmann . The movie features many at the time unknown young actors or other movie makers , who later grew out to be stars . Most notably to me were Walter Long , who would later appear in a couple of Laurel & Hardy movies and Raoul Walsh as John Wilkes Booth , who would later direct some classic - and Errol Flynn movies , mostly in the ' 40's . A must-see for every objective movie-lover .
483927	1416505	39689	10.0	One of the best film-noirs I have ever seen .	The movie is a classic in every sense of the word . The best things about film-noirs is always the atmosphere and " Out of the Past " is filled with fantastic atmosphere thanks to good sets , cinematography story and acting . All of these things combined make this movie one of the greatest of its kind . The story is typically film-noir like and is full with some great and unexpected moments and twists . The movie really comes to live thanks to some good actors and their characters . Robert Mitchum is on the roll as Jeff Bailey , aka Jeff Markham and so is Kirk Douglas in one of his first roles . A real classic film noir !
483872	1416505	82096	10.0	Amazing movie !	This is easily the best submarine movie ever made ! And even better , it's the best European movie of all time and maybe even one of the best war films . This is one of the only movies that shows the story from the " other side " . You can actually feel along with the Germans and you have sympathy for them . This is because it shows the characters as individual soldiers fighting for their own cost instead as cruel heartless Nazi's . There are even lot's of anti-Nazi feeling expressed by the characters throughout the movie . After 5 minutes you've even forgotten that you're watching a German spoken movie . The characters are all very likable and realistic but the main character of the movie is the submarine itself ! The movie is probably the most claustrophobic one ever made . The claustrophobic feeling is created by the excellent camera work that makes you feel that you're really aboard the submarine and you're one of it's crew members . Further more the atmosphere is very gritty and depressing which does good to the movie . The film is actually really tense and can bring you to the edge of your seat . This is mainly because the story avoids every possible cliché and the ending is one of the most surprising endings of all time . The long scene's were nothing really happens are never boring and are a great addition to the movie because it shows the emotions and the feeling of the crew members really well . Truly amazing !
483777	1416505	120324	10.0	Just one of those movies in which everything adds up perfectly .	This is one of those rare fairly recent movies in which everything just adds up perfectly . It also pleases me to see that you don't necessarily need a big budget to make a brilliant with these days and still have a great talented and acclaimed cast & crew involved in it . This movie has always been compared a lot to " Fargo " . And yes , there also are similarities ; both movies involve a large sum of movie , both involve some odd but yet realistic character , both involve killings , both involve a seemingly good plan that goes from bad till worse and both involve snow . A lot of snow . " A Simple Plan " is also a very white looking movie , which provides the movie with a good - as well as beautiful looking settings and atmosphere . But perhaps the reason why this movie never really became a financial or critical big success was also " Fargo " . This movie was made only 2 years after the brilliant " Fargo " and like always the majority of the public say this movie as a bad copy , trying to cash in after the success of " Fargo " . And also like always , the movie is now , almost 10 years later , slowly gaining more credit and is better known and watched by more and more people . What mainly makes " A Simple Plan " such a great movie is that it features ordinary everyday people . It makes the characters and therefor the movie as a whole , a very realistic feeling one to watch . It of course also helps that they are being played by some top-class actors . It's funny how Bill Paxton always basically plays the same guy but hey , he's good at it . Billy Bob Thornton is also always at his best playing these sort of simple minded characters . This is yet another wonderful performance by him and he rightfully so was also nominated for an Oscar for it . This is not really the sort of movie you 1 , 2 , 3 would expect from a guy like Sam Raimi . There is also basically very little in this movie that can be described as ' typicaly Raimi ' . Not even Ted Raimi is present in it ! Everything indicates that his is just an in between little project for him , which all makes it sort of ironic that this is also one of his best movies . It has a very effective story , that on top of all things is really well written and constructed . It's a character movie but also with lots of twists and turns in the actual plot . The story style reminds us of a good old fashioned film-noir . It's about ordinary people who get themselves into an ordinary situation . They form ' a simple plan ' but almost immediately things start to go from bad till worse , without giving any spoilers . The story was written by Scott B . Smith , who based it on his own novel . The screenplay was even nominated for an Oscar as well . A rare great movie , that is so great due to its realistic approach , performances and a well written and constructed story .
484497	1416505	110912	10.0	Brilliant story telling makes this movie an unique one .	Quentin Tarantino had done it again . If you thought he would just be an one day fly after " Reservoir Dogs " , you couldn't be more wrong . Once again just like in " Reservoir Dogs " the storytelling is unique . The movie has several different story lines that are all in some way connected and to make the story even more complicated , they are not told in the right order . It sound like the story is hard to follow , how ever this is not the case . The story is easy to follow , so everybody should be able to see the brilliance of it . The movie is filled with sex , drugs , violence and bad language . All of this combined makes the movie one of the most kick butt movies . All of the stories are great and wonderfully written . It's amazing to see how they are connected . The stories are not typically Hollywood like , meaning that they are not predictable and don't follow the Hollywood movie rules . What makes the stories even more great are the dialogues . The movie is filled with the famous trademark Tarantino dialogues and is a true pleasure to listen to , they are very raw and realistic , just like the characters . Brilliant dialogue ! There are countless classic scene's and some of them are up there with the most classic out of movie history . The movie is filled with some great music that sets the movies mood . There is a big all star cast with actors such as John Travolta , Samuel L . Jackson , Tim Roth , Amanda Plummer , Phil LaMarr , Frank Whaley , Bruce Willis , Ving Rhames , Uma Thurman , Harvey Keitel and Christopher Walken . Having such a cast is already a signal that this is more than just an ordinary movieA must see unique movie .
