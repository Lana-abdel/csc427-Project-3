485487	1416505	92042	2.0	No pace , no good story , no good acting . A really bad movie !	This is one dreadful movie . The movie just drags and drags on without any pace or good story development . And the horrible accents and acting also didn't made it exactly pleasant to watch . Couldn't they at least have tried to make it a bit entertaining ? After all I watch this movie expecting it to be an adventure movie . There was not one thing in this movie that was entertaining . I really can't think of one reason why it is worth it that any person should ever watch this movie . Especially after seeing " The Sea Hawk " with Errol Flynn a couple of days ago , this movie is a real disappointment . How did a fine composer like Maurice Jarre ever got into this mess ? this movie really is not worthy to have this man's music . A real unpleasant watch . One to avoid at all cost .
484390	1416505	60457	2.0	And the Oscar for best original movie title goes to . . .	First of all , don't take this movie serious people . This way you'll enjoy it the most . It's a typical British goof-ball comedy , with mainly one big difference to it ; that this movie also stars icons Boris Karloff and Basil Rathbone , in one of their last movies . Yes of course their age really shows . Karloff was nearly 80 at the time of this production and Rathbone sounded as if he had last his denture . But of course their presence alone still adds some class to the movie and gives the movie as a whole a certain bit of extra . Besides them two the movie also features Nancy Sinatra , who hasn't appeared in a lot of movies in her lifetime . The movie features mainly very silly humor , that on top of it all also just isn't exactly very funny . It's however so clumsy and embarrassing to watch all that it also becomes sort of a cute harmless little movie , that becomes fun to watch due to this clumsy and amateur like film-making , the overall movie has . But the humor isn't the main issue of the movie . It's its story that makes this movie such a bad one to watch . Halve of the time I really don't know what is going on on screen , because it all is just so confusingly bad to follow . Who are all these characters and what do they want ? This is a perfect example of how not to make a movie . The movie gets all the more painful to watch as it heads toward its ending . The movie also features some very random musical numbers , with scary ' 60's dancing to it . One of the elements that makes this a quite odd movie to watch . An embarrassment to watch .
483767	1416505	71439	2.0	Jesus Franco's take on the Dr . Mabuse franchise .	Jesus Franco's take on the Dr . Mabuse franchise . . . well that should sum up pretty much how this movie is like . Jesus Franco is a director who has always distinguished himself by delivering extremely bad and poor movies . He's always fascinated with putting a lot of nudity and explicit sexuality into his movies . He began early in his career by making mostly bad horror flicks in the ' 60's and ' 70's but his career has now reached a point that he's stuck to mostly soft-erotic movies . In many ways his career parallels that of Ed Wood's , also not in the least because of the comparable qualities of their movies . Who ever gave him the green light to do a Dr . Mabuse movie ? Fritz Lang is turning over in his grave . As you would expect , this movie has actually very little to do with the previous Dr . Mabuse movies . It features an extremely muddled story with all kind of oddness's over it and you just simply don't bother to try and understand what the story is all about . It's some extremely bad and disjointed storytelling within this movie . Often the scenes and different characters and plot lines just don't blend in with each other . The characters ( Really , a couple of cowboy cops ? ) and dialogs are often just horrible and simply laughable . And yes , of course the movie also features a couple of lesbian actions . A thing Jesus Franco also really seems obsessed with . The nudity and sexual content within this movie just seems terribly out of place and makes this more a ' dirty movie ' than a real serious attempt by Franco . Not that I expected this in advance though . Like a typical Franco flick , it's also a real cheap looking movie , with bad locations , laughable make-up effects ( what was that monster creature all about ? ) and shot sequences without the use of any additional lighting , or anything of that sort . On top of that , Jesus Franco also felt to urge to compose the music for this movie . What an horrible , horrible choice that was . Seriously only watchable for the fans of Franco-trash .
484269	1416505	61411	3.0	Peter Cushing versus a giant moth ! Yeah right . . .	Pulp , pulp absolute pulp . The story is just as silly as it sounds . The also didn't bother to explain - or make sense to anything . For a monster movie it also doesn't have enough ' monster ' in it and the story is not tense or mysterious mainly because it's such a complete mess . The story is incredible B-movie like . A scientist has created a creature that can transform back and forth between a giant moth ( what the . . . ? ! ? ) and a young woman . To stay alive , the moth has to feed itself with fresh blood of innocent victims . This is where Peter Cushing comes in . He plays an inspector who is set to investigate this strange and mysterious murders . An awful few is ever happening in this movie . From start till the finish the movie basically isn't heading anywhere and the movie is filled with dull moments that are distracting from the main plot line of the movie . Yes , it really is a movie about nothing . The giant moth creature makes the whole even more ridicules . The moth itself is not back looking but the transformation scene's are laughable bad . Even the transformation sequences in " The Wolf Man " from 1941 were more convincing . The moth also gets very little interesting to do in the movie and is only featured in about 3 very short sequences I believe . The entire movie is also horribly edited together . At times it feels like entire sequences were cut out , or not even filmed . The movie jumps from one sequence to another . At least Peter Cushing seemed to be enjoying himself during filming . Just look at his face during his sequences with Russell Napier and Vanessa Howard . Also Glynn Edwards was somewhat good and enjoyable in his role . Robert Flemyng and Vanessa Howard were however dreadful most of the time . Also look out for Kenneth Colley ( Captain / Admiral Piett from " Star Wars : Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back " and " Star Wars : Episode VI - Return of the Jedi " . ) and a very young David Griffin ( Emmet from " Keeping Up Appearances " . ) in quite a big role . The ending of the movie is also a huge letdown . It's very simple and completely unsatisfying . Perphaps almost even laughable . Guess it's still only a bit good and scary when you are afraid of moths .
483732	1416505	365194	3.0	One of the most ridiculously pointless movies I have ever seen .	This movie its story feels like a very lame excuse to bring some material arts fighting sequences to the big screen . You know how Star Wars fan films are always used as a lame excuse to do a lightsaber fight , well same goes for this movie , only it aren't lightsaber fights in this movie but its material arts instead . The movie really feels like a amateur movie at times . All of the fight sequences were nicely choreographed , no doubt about that and its obvious that director Jamel Aattache has a passion for material arts movies but all of the fights in the movie felt simply pointless and they really came out of nowhere at times . It's good to watch as a material arts demonstration all but as a movie this movie is simply terrible . Because of this all the story never really flows well which makes the movie almost impossible to watch at times . The story is extremely weak and simple and the romantic elements of the movie between Kim Ho Kim and Chantal Janzen simply don't work , because there is no chemistry between those two and their love seems very unlikely to happen . The acting was also completely horrible . Kim Ho Kim doesn't have enough charisma as an actor for a role like this one . Chantal Janzen was simply terrible in her role and the person who decided to give Ron Smoorenburg so many lines should had also been fired . Ron Smoorenburg is a great material arts fighter but he simply isn't much good as an actor . It's also due to director Jamel Aattache that some of the acting was really lame at times , he simply isn't a very good actors-director . The cinematography by Peter-Jan van der Burgh was good and gave the movie a very professional look at times . the city Rotterdam is a perfect background for movies , this one included . They really should make some more movies and series in this city . It's a great charismatic and atmospheric background for movies and series , not a great place to live in though . Also the musical score by Yorick Goldewijk was very good and suited the movie perfectly . But unfortunately some great cinematography and the good musical score aren't enough to conceal the movie its almost none-excising lame story . It makes " Fighting Fish " an absolutely horrible and pointless movie to watch . Probably the only ones who can still find some pleasure in this movie are persons who love material arts . It has some good material arts moments in it but as a movie this one is a complete failure that also suffers from a terrible amateur look at times .
484609	1416505	60664	3.0	Waste of a great story .	I shall not pretend as if I have seen the 1928 version of this movie ( not yet anyway but I'm certainly planning to ) with Conrad Veidt in the main lead , or the original from 1921 , of which this movie is a remake but it's pretty safe to assume that those movies are better than this version . The movie is absolutely horribly made . The concept and setting are quite good and promising but it is all wasted with the weak storytelling of it all . The story itself , based on the book by Victor Hugo , is quite fascination , almost Shakesperean like . It has some great elements in it but it is all wasted in this movie . All of the potential is ruined but the weak acting , dreadful camera-work ( seriously , don't they know what a focus-puller is ? ) and horrible editing . The story is also told messy and at times you don't even know who exactly are supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys of the movie . It makes the movie very unpleasant and uneasy to watch at times . There are still some good moments in the movie , especially in the middle but overall the movie is a dragging , messy , confusing one that isn't really worth watching . The movie also becomes unnecessary ridicules at times , especially toward the ending of the movie . It truly becomes laughable bad at times and loses all of it's credibility because of those many moments , that are present in the movie . Great story , very bad storytelling and execution of it all .
485524	1416505	389097	3.0	An huge disappointment .	I expected great things from this movie after seeing the trailer but I ended up extremely disappointed by the end result . The major problem is that the movie lacks a story . The story just seems like a lame excuse for a bunch of guys to dress up like WW II soldiers and fight each other . Also the few story elements that are present are extremely flawed , unlikely and unbelievable . Still there is some nice character development for a 15 minute short although not all characters are likeable for the viewer . The costumes ( with the exception of the soldier with the white pants , who I call Pvt . Pants now ) are nice and so are the settings . The acting is fairly good and the dialogues are acceptable and the movie doesn't have that much of an amateur look . The effects however are pretty lame . The talent and the passion for movie making is there , however the execution of it all is simply not good . Better luck next time and try to add some more story the next time please .
484410	1416505	59737	4.0	Really no bad story or premise but what a bad execution of it all !	The movie has a rather good typical genre revenge-story but the story gets almost completely ruined by the movie its poor directing and annoyingly bad dialog . It's not that the movie has a bad story but it's still a poorly written . And the things they say ! Oh man , the spend 3 lines on things they could say with just 5 words . Some of the dialog is ridicules and at times completely redundant for the movie . Really some of the worst dialog writing I have seen in a long time . How did those actors ever agreed to say all those lines ? Unfortunately the movie also feels the need to put in a female character and love-story . I mean no offense but women in westerns have just never quite worked out . Even in the best westerns , the women still felt out of place and did not worked out . I understand that it's PC and good for marketing reasons but some genres are just not created to have female characters in it . But on top of that the love-story in this movie feels rather forced and out of place and is just not quite believable , since Pilar seems like a complete bore and shallow character , that no tough gunfighter would ever fall for . It also seems silly that the biggest spoiler and surprise of the movie is also in the movie it's title . What's up with that ! ? The musical score for the movie was unexpectedly great . I liked it surprising much ! One of the very few highlights of the movie . The directing was very poor and it ruined some of the potentially good moments of the movie . It also made some of the action seemed bad and ridicules . It's the sort of clumsy action you would normally expect to see in a ' 30's movie or a " The A-Team " type of series . Characters come and go in the movie and evil and good guys keep switching constantly . The main character isn't even introduced until 10 minutes into the movie . The main villains are disappointing and underused . Never fully showed in the movie why they are being considered such legendary and bad villainous characters in the West . Also non of the actors are really any great ones but then again , they also aren't really helped by the dialog in the movie . Still some of the action makes the movie worthwhile to watch , at least for the genre fans . Some action sequences are surprisingly big ( seemed to me they'd watched " The Magnificent Seven " before making this movie ? ) and even though some of the action seems to constantly repeat itself , it's still great to watch !
484738	1416505	114436	4.0	A look into the world of bi-sexual strippers and showgirls . . . who cares ? !	This movie makes a totally pointless impression . The story and characters are totally uninteresting and the movie is way too long . None of Verhoeven's style and excellence are present in this movie , so not even fans of him will get a kick out of this . This is a movie with basically zero story . The movie is not really heading anywhere and the characters certainly don't make this movie more interesting either . Nomi Malone is a pretty weird character if you ask me . It is unclear at times what she exactly wants and she keeps changing her mind time after time which gets a little annoying after a while . A movie were you already don't understand the main character is per definition already a bad one of course . It really is the pointless story and the not understandable characters that ruin this movie . The movie takes itself way too serious . I have the feeling that the movie would had been better had it more humor and satire in it . But none of Verhoeven's typical humor is present in the movie . The only typical Verhoeven aspect present in this movie is nudity but besides that , there is no other way that you can tell that Verhoeven directed this movie . The nudity might be about the only thing this movie deserves credit for . I mean , this is finally a movie that isn't afraid to show total nudity and the main actresses aren't afraid to take of all their clothes and do some explicit scenes . It isn't really that bad as a movie , I mean it is still a movie that had been made with lots of flair and style but the totally pointless , uninteresting and ridicules story makes this a movie that you probably would be better of not watching .
484222	1416505	417433	4.0	Not interesting .	The best way to describe this movie in my opinion is to say it's not that interesting . I honestly don't understand why some movies ever get made . Seriously now , how can you as a studio ever green-light such a project after you've read the very generic script , filled with all the clichés and the usual suspects . It offers no surprises at all and it's a totally predictable movie from start till finish . It's a self indulged project , that is about living the American dream by joining a prestigious naval academy . But why our main character exactly wants to be in it so badly just never really becomes clear to me . Becomes he promised his mother before her death ? Now seriously , that seems like a totally crazy thing to promise to your mother now doesn't it ? A lot of things just don't become clear to me in this movie . For instance also why exactly the two main characters , played by James Franco and Tyrese Gibson hate each other so badly from the start on . It seems to have no grounds . And why is he liked Lt . Burton so much ? What makes his character so special ? To me he just seems like one of the boys and gals of the naval academy and he has no particular special skills or ideals . Also his boxing skills aren't that impressive . For in essence " Annapolis " strangely enough is also a boxing movie . Not that the boxing serves a significant enough purpose for the movie though really , since the movie focuses on so many ( too many ) more elements around it . Also the way the boxing sequences are shot is just completely terrible . It shows it as a sport in which you have to punch as hard as you can without stopping . Seriously , no tactics are involved and I actually wonder if the movie had a boxing coach or professional present during the making of the movie , since it seems to me that the cast and crew had no idea what there were doing when it came down to its boxing sequences . It's a movie that gives boxing a sort of a bad name . It presents the sport as one in which two crazed individuals aggressively , constantly take a swing at another . But the movie concentrates on much more elements . It's a dramatic , romantic , sports movie . It's however also very predictable in every way , which ensures the the drama , the romance as well as the sport just doesn't work out in this movie . All of the characters are so incredibly standard and overdone . All of the characters you would expect in a movie about a tough naval academy are present here . But also the script just doesn't ever offer any surprises . And yes , of course the movie also manages to throw in a love-story , which just wasn't necessary and it doesn't exactly make this movie any better or more likable to watch . In the end I just don't really know what this movie is about . Is it about the main character trying to fix the relationship between him and his father ? Or is it perhaps about achieving something in life by devoting yourself to the service of your country ? Is it about fighting for your chance in life ? Is it about finding and getting with the love of your life ? I'm really not sure what the movie tried to achieve and it tries to throw in a bit of everything , however with as a result that basically nothing really works out for the movie as it should had . James Franco is a good actor but he just ain't quite ready yet the play the main character in any movie . He is always at his best playing a secondary character , that stays more on the background but has as well also has just a couple of big scene's for himself . The movie is filled with some other well known actors but none of their characters really work out , which is obviously not mainly just due to their acting performances but mostly more to it's formulaic script and probably also directing . It's a funny thing that the unknown Vicellous Reon Shannon , who yet plays a very formulaic role ( the fat guy with twinkies under his bed ) , is the only actor who lets his character work out and lets him become one you can actually sympathize for . No sir , I don't like it . The movie just isn't interesting to watch . It's clichéd and just overall doesn't seem to have a point .
485012	1416505	213149	5.0	Titanic II	Contains minor spoilersThe movie tries too hard to be like " Titanic " and uses all the ingredients that are used in " Titanic " but " Pearl Harbor " fails . . . The biggest problem with this movie is that the film makers can't seem to decide what for a movie they wanted to make : A spectacular one or a realistic one , with as a result that the realistic / shocking scene's in the movie just don't work in the way they should . The actors only seems to have been cast because of their looks instead of their acting skills . Especially the nurses look unrealistic beautiful complete with make-up and hair style . And then the love story . . . well what can I say , the love story just doesn't work for me and is over the top at some points SPOILERfor instance when Evelyn ( Kate Beckinsale ) finds out she is pregnant , that just seemed so over the top and out of place that I almost stopped watching the movie at that pointSPOILER You can say that the love story kind of ruins the movie at some points . The character are not interesting enough due to poor character development and I wondered lot's of times throughout the movie : " Why are we following this characters ? ? ? What makes them so interesting to follow ? ? ? " In my opinion the movie should have focused more on the political aspects of Pearl Harbor and the leaders , like Roosevelt ( Jon Voight ) and the attack itself instead of Rafe and Danny ( Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett ) and their friendship and problems . Another thing that bothered me is the Cuba Gooding Jr . character . The character is just pointless and it's only distracting and seem so out of place . The only reason I can think of why they had put them in the movie is because it's a political correct character to put in a movie . One more thing before I'll mention the things I liked about the movie . The movie makes an huge mistake to not stop after the attack on Pearl Harbor . The movie goes on and follows the Doolittle raid on Japan . This is absolutely pointless and I think that an alternate ending should had been made . The things I liked : First of all , I thought all the Roosevelt ( Jon Voight ) scene's were fantastic . Secondly Alec Baldwin played in my opinion a great role as Lt . Colonel James ' Jimmy ' Doolittle . Some more things that I liked are : The camera work ( although it was VERY over the top ) , the editing ( the movie has a good quick pace ) , the music by Hans Zimmer and the attack on Pearl Harbor itself was made beautifully . I don't mean to bash the movie too hard , but it just isn't good enough . If you want to see a good spectacular / realistic war movie you should watch " Black Hawk Down " instead and if you want to see a good realistic war movie you should watch " Saving Private Ryan " . Only watch this movie for the special effects and when you have nothing else to do , you might even like it ( I know that some people just love this movie ) .
484162	1416505	282552	5.0	Really well made genre movie but man , what bad storytelling !	The movie is really good looking with a great visual style , that makes this a great genre movie to watch . But the movie has such an incredibly bad story and storytelling that the movie still manages to almost become unwatchable at times . Not only just the story is simple and formulaic , it also is told in about the worst way possible . The story never flows well , which is probably also due to some bad editing . Seems like director Gérard Pirès only concentrated on the style and action of the movie and not on its story at all . Definitely a case of style over substance . The story features lots of clichés and some highly unlikely moments , even for action movie standards and the movie also doesn't exactly become much better as the movie develops . The movie even gets truly ridicules at times . Too bad because with its style and cast involved , the movie really showed some potential . The movie really has a great cast . Stephen Dorff is a great actor and he also even shows that in this movie . Bruce Payne goes way too much over-the-top with his role , which causes him to be an unlikely and not likable enough villain . Steven Berkoff is way better , in an also over-the-top but very fun role , as a Southern villain , with an Elvis-wig . It's a role you normally wouldn't expect from him . And thank goodness that Natasha Henstridge's role is smaller than she is credited with . The action is fair enough . Definitely no big-budget kind of stuff but obviously also way better than the average B-action movie . The movie provides a couple of thrills and kicks . Some of the special effects are a bit too fake looking at times unfortunately . A fair enough enjoyable guilty-pleasure to watch but don't forget to switch off your brain first .
484123	1416505	36191	5.0	A fantasy movie without real good fantasy .	Well , I'm sorry but no matter how much I expected myself to like this movie , I just didn't . No it's of course not like this is the worst movie I have ever seen but I was shocked at how poorly this movie actually was constructed . Problem is that the movie feels way too messy , especially with its fantasy elements thrown into the story . Quite frankly the movie simply featured some poor storytelling and this movie is simply not how a fantasy movie should be like . The movie tries hard to create a magical kind of atmosphere but instead the fantasy elements often feel awkward and way too sudden . Sometimes it doesn't even serve a purpose for the movie it's story . It's just not a movie that could grab me . The storytelling is too messy and certain story elements seem very random and don't really blend in with the rest of the movie . The characters are confusing as well . Perhaps it would had helped if the movie was closer to 3 hours long , rather than it's now almost 2 hours of running time . From a movie with a fantasy story such as this , also some more entertainment was to be expected . The movie only mildly entertains throughout but the movie just never becomes an awful lot of fun to watch , due to its story or fantasy elements . But it needs to be said that for a 1943 movie this is simply a great looking one . It used some unique coloring techniques , Agfacolor , which German film-makers used between 1939 and 1945 . It gives the movie an unique , very bright looking style . But also the sets and costumes are fine looking , though obviously deliberately fake looking as well at times . A movie that tries really very hard but in the end just isn't good and entertaining enough .
485552	1416505	196229	5.0	More lame than funny really .	I like Ben Stiller but seriously he should stop directing movies . The directing is really the weakest element of the movie and almost kills the fun entirely . Stiller also seems to be seriously obsessed with getting as many pointless close-ups of his wife Christine Taylor as possible . I mean she sure is pretty and all but it just gets distracting and annoying after a while . This is one of those movies that has hits and misses and when it hits , it doesn't hit hard . The humor is kind of lame and too over-the-top to be funny . This humor works for , as for instance Austin Powers but not for Derek Zoolander unfortunately . The movie never really becomes really funny , this is also due to the totally ridicules story . Still the movie makes some good fun of the modeling world at times and the small cameo's by the many famous people also makes this movie still somewhat entertaining to watch . The acting of especially the main characters played by Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson is good and is probably what prevents this movie from a completely unfunny and unwatchable one . All the characters are good and funny but unfortunately the script and directing is awful , so they don't get an awful lot to do in the movie . You are better of watching a different Ben Stiller movie , or an Austin Powers movie if you like silly modern humor .
483822	1416505	59905	5.0	Unsuccesful and above all unsatisfying genre attempt .	Director Val Guest got his fame for directing horror / science-fiction movies in the ' 50's . His movies never have really been the greatest but they were decent enough genre pieces , that are also quite well known , all over the world . With comedies he just never received much fame or praise and for a good reason , also especially when you look at this film . Though the right intentions are definitely there , this just isn't a good enough genre movie . The movie is obviously trying to be a light entertaining espionage movie , perhaps even a genre spoof - and cold war spoof at times . The movie as a whole just isn't light enough in its settings and events to consider this really an entertaining movie , that doesn't successfully parodies or even entertains enough . The movie works in parts as a comedy and entertainment , especially in the beginning but its many more weaker moments really downgrade the movie and in parts even makes it a totally unwatchable and bad one . The movie has a main plot line but it almost seemed as if they simply shot the movie as it was on the call-sheets , without paying much attention to development . Because of that the movie also becomes mostly uninteresting to watch and the events in the movie almost impossible to follow or care for . The movie its main problem is really how poorly developed it is . Also with its seemingly important characters in the movie , that come and go and never get properly introduced or developed . The movie has further more a great cast , filled with mostly some of the best British actors from its period . It are the sort of actors you perhaps not know by name but definitely by face . Of course David Niven is well known and he carries the movie well with his role and he also proofs how well he can handle the comedy genre but no matter how great he is , he feels out of place nevertheless , mostly due to his age . He just doesn't seem believable enough as a spy who gets the girls and charms his way through things . The movie is shot at some nice far off locations but still the movie feels very low-budget . This is also due to some incredibly lame and fake looking miniature effects . Pay especially attention toward the ending when a character is jumping from a riding plane . Not a complete train-wreck but not exactly a movie worth searching out either .
484209	1416505	183523	5.0	Incoherent movie .	" Mission to Mars " is far from a good movie but it's hard to say what it is that makes this movie a not so good one . It probably is due to the incoherent feeling of the movie . Most of the scene's and moments don't really feel connected and the movie feels like several separate scene's , simply glued together . The movie does has some good and powerful moments but because of the incoherent feeling of the scene's all together , the movie never truly works out as it was supposed to and the ending leaves a bad aftertaste . The movie has some truly excellent actors in it ; Gary Sinise , Don Cheadle , Connie Nielsen , Tim Robbins , Armin Mueller-Stahl . Those are some big names ! Every actor does really well in this movie and gives a truly excellent performance . The movie is professionally made . The movie is visually good looking and has some nicely looking special effects in it , even though they are a bit over-the-top at times . The are some typical trademark Brian De Palma tense moments in the movie but even those moments don't work out fully an 100 % . De Palma fans will be disappointed . Ennio Morricone delivers a really great musical score for this movie . It's both dramatic and heroic and is truly a pleasure to listen to . It sounds strange but I think that Morricone is really underrated as an artist . Most people will only know him for his Western score's but Morricone has really delivered some memorable and under-appreciated score's in his lifetime such as ; " The Mission " , " In the Line of Fire " , " The Untouchables " and many more . " Mission to Mars " is another of his under-appreciated score's . It truly is a soundtrack worth owning . From a technical point of view there is little wrong with the movie but it is the incoherent storytelling that makes " Mission to Mars " a failed mission . The scene's don't always feel connected and also the ending can't be called entirely satisfying . Also story-wise the movie doesn't always make completely sense and there are some implausibilities at times . Still fans of the science-fiction genre will find some joy in this movie . It really isn't a THAT bad movie and at times it also is a really entertaining one . It's just that the bad story and storytelling completely ruin all the movie its potential . It's still a watchable movie but I simply can not recommend it wholeheartedly .
484362	1416505	120841	5.0	Just one of those pointless sequels that adds nothing .	It's not an horrible movie but it surely is a pointless one . Compared to the first movie this one adds very little new and originality . Seems like the only reason why they put Natasha Henstridge in this movie was to connect this movie with the first one . Her character is a totally better one this time and quite frankly I think the movie and particularly its story would had been better off without it . It would had also made this movie more fresh and original to watch . 2 other actors from the fist movie also re-appear in this one ; Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger . Michael Madsen is basically always awesome to watch in any movie and any type of role he plays . He is a pleasant addition to this movie , even though of course its far from his best movie role , which is also due to its silly script and poor dialog . The chemistry he had with Helgenberger in the first movie is also completely gone in this movie . Seriously the writing of this movie is so lazy . Her we have an alien that is being hunted down , who is inside the body of the first man who walked on Mars . That makes him about the number one most famous face of the world , yet he can walk around freely and the military and all secret agencies have a hard time tracking them down . Really not the most believable and likely plot premise . The movie is filled with some other holes and big improbabilities . There also are some new characters appearing in this movie , not played by the least actors . Mykelti Williamson , George Dzundza and James Cromwell are some well known names . There also is a quite nice little cameo by Richard Belzer as the U . S . president , which is quite fun if you know Richard Belzer . Unfortunately none of the great actors can really spice up the movie its script . The movie obviously had a lesser budget to spend this time . At times the movie even looks like a made-for-TV movie , which also might be due to the fact that director Peter Medak has a lot of experience with TV movie and not as much with big theatrical movies , even though he is capable of something better . Just watch the 1980 horror movie " The Changeling " . Despite that all , the movie its effects are all quite nice looking and the movie also has some good looking gore to shock with . What the movie is lacking though is its good eerie atmosphere of the first movie . It also makes " Species II " a less effective movie to watch . Also having a male alien this means a less seductive and therefore at the same time also less interesting movie to watch . It has some good elements and nice moments but basically you overall are better off by just sticking to the original .
484288	1416505	252963	5.0	Watchable but I can't think of any reason why you should watch this movie .	This movie really had the potential in it to become one of my favorite movies ; Horror and Nazi's . I always found this combination to be an intriguing one and I in general always enjoy and admire movies that try to combine several different elements such as different genre combinations and time period combinations . Plus I like watching movies with Nazi's in it ( OK that sounded just wrong ) because they're basically the ultimate movie villains . The movie is from a period when the WW II genre was hot and popular again . A period that was launched by the success and critical acclaim of Steven Spielberg's " Saving Private Ryan " . This movie is just like any other genre movie that tried to gain some money after that success . The movie lacks in basically everything ; tension , mystery , character development , plot . On top of that the movie is obviously also made with a low-budget , which really shows on screen . The concept of the movie sounds good enough for a scary , tense and atmospheric horror movie . The movie is perhaps more atmospheric than anything else but this just isn't enough in this case , since the movie builds up and builds up to basically nothing . Nothing extraordinary , tense or even mysterious ever really occurs in this movie , which is of course a huge miss and rather weird and disappointing to watch . The movie has some good actors in it but none really shine in this movie . The characters remain too flat for that and the movie has too many characters in it and lacks a good - and likable main character . And yes it's definitely a bit weird to see some ' British-as-they-can-get ' actors play a couple of Nazi's . As a matter of fact is there any reason that the characters in this movie are Nazi's , rather than British or American soldiers ? As the movie progresses it becomes obvious why ; they did it because the characters in the movie are far from good guys , as strongly becomes obvious at the end and with the help of some flashbacks . Having Americans , British or any other allied group as the main characters would had been far too sensitive and would had aroused far more criticism and controversy . It's definitely not an unwatchable movie but I just can't think of any reason why anyone should ever watch this movie .
485015	1416505	110353	5.0	Thank goodness western-comedies are a rare thing .	There are tons of comedies made every year . Not too many of them are about the old west It's also not a mix that really ever works out , without becoming a spoof of the genre and use all of its formulaic elements . The story seems to lack a clear purpose . It's hard to say what the movie is really about and were its heading to . One top of that , things just don't ever flow well in the movie . Everything seems to happen suddenly and without a reason for the rest of the story . On its comical level its also a rather weak one . For a comedy it surely has some few real laughs . It's one of those comedies that keeps you waiting for a punch-line that just never comes . On top of that the situations in this movie just aren't humorous . Guess they thought that the movie would already be strong and funny enough by making it a buddy-flick , about an old bandit and a mute bandit-wannabe . Paul Hogan isn't too bad in this movie , although he was clearly far too old for his role at the time . He provides the movie with its best comical moments and some good funny dialog . The Cuba Gooding Jr . character is a bit of a weird one . He's a mute who works at a store and he obviously feel that he is above the simple town-folk and then for some unexplained reasons decides to become a bandit and team-up with , the obviously incapable , bandit Lightning Jack Kane . It also makes you wonder what's the challenging thing for a character to play a mute character . Cuba Gooding Jr . really isn't a bad actors but he too often appears in such weak movies and uninteresting comical roles , that it makes you wonder why he keeps doing it . Guess that he just has fun playing in these type of movies . I'm happy that at least someone had fun . Pat Hingle is also in this movie , in a typical Pat Hingle role . Too bad that they didn't gave his character more screen time , though they potentially really could had done that . The movie is rather good looking and it doesn't look like some cheap attempt . The costume were especially nice . The musical score on the other hand didn't seemed fitting . It's one of those simplistic scores that sound as if it was completed months before the movie finished shooting and therefor doesn't fit or add anything to the images . Has its moments but overall a below average and totally uninteresting comedy attempt .
484353	1416505	56573	6.0	Unescary remake but luckily Gert Fröbe is back again !	This movie is not bad but it's a too simple entry in the Dr . Mabuse movie franchise . It's part of the long running Dr . Mabuse franchise and a remake of the 1933 movie with the same title , directed by Fritz Lang . It's a bit weird that they decided to do a remake this time , as if they ran out of original ideas of its own . But then again , can you really call this a remake ? It changed quite a lot , including the characters . It doesn't have an awful lot to do plot-wise with the 1933 movie and only a few sequences are similar . It also almost exactly copies the car chase in the finale of the movie but it of course can't beat the brilliant original . The movie is not really mysterious since it show Dr . Mabuse and his intentions pretty early on in the movie . In the original version it was still kept a mystery for long that Dr . Mabuse was still alive and that he still was just as much in control as always . This movie chooses a far more simplified approach of things . The movie is instead now often more silly than really tense or mysterious . It has some certain clumsiness's and silliness's in it , which makes the movie feel far more outdated than its 1962 year of production would normally suggest it is . And even though it's not a slow or boring movie , it just isn't a very exciting one either really . At least a real positive thing was that Gert Fröbe returned again in his role as Kriminalkommissar Lohmann . The same role he had played before in " Im Stahlnetz des Dr . Mabuse " . And what he great actor he was ! Also Wolfgang Preiss reprises his role of Dr . Mabuse once more , for the fourth time already . Luckily his role in this movie is much larger again and he is better than ever before in this movie . It's OK to watch , if you also liked the previous Dr . Mabuse movies .
484478	1416505	122718	6.0	Great kids movie .	Entertaining movie that especially the kids will like . The story is simple and easy to follow without any logic . In other words a appealing nonsense movie for kids that want to have a good time . Luckily there also are some jokes for the adults . Especially the " Patton " scene in which composer Jerry Goldsmith spoofs himself is priceless . Director Joe Dante goes " Gremlins " style again , although he uses the same elements the movie is not near as good but it certainly has the same amount of fun , maybe even more . What makes the movie are the wonderful toys . The Commando Elite is certainly a great piece of toy that kids will find very appealing . The Gorgonites are pretty lame and a bit too childish at times but luckily the movie focuses more on The Commando Elite . What makes the toys really cool is the wonderful voice cast , Tommy Lee Jones is really awesome as Maj . Chip Hazard , the leader of the gang . The " human " cast is also great . It has a great kid cast and the parents are portrayed very entertaining especially Phil Hartman ( RIP ) and Wendy Schaal as Phil and Marion Fimple . Jay Mohr and David Cross are also good for some comical situations . The special effects are also wonderful . The toys really come alive in a way you couldn't possibly imaging . Stereotype kids movie with an easy to follow story that maybe at some points is a bit too childish but very appealing to kids nevertheless .
484719	1416505	87755	6.0	Enjoyable enough Muppet vehicle .	This is a rather enjoyable and harmless entertaining Muppet movie , featuring most of the well known Muppets . It really isn't their best or most memorable one though . Lets face it and be honest here , this movie really isn't the greatest made or best written one . The only real reason that the movie still works out is thanks to the Muppets . The humor actually isn't that much good , since its mostly simply written and the events are predictable . Nevertheless the movie still manages to become funny because of the humorous and well known characters , that need no introduction . For me it really was in this case Miss Piggy that makes the movie work out . Her character features by far the most humorous and enjoyable situations . Miss Piggy is basically a Muppet-favorite of every one ! She is such a great and comical character . Also the idea alone that a grown up man , such as Frank Oz , is with his hand inside a silly looking pig and doing a very feminine voice is reason enough already to crack me up . I really respect the Muppet-performers and their timing and handling is always just great , especially Frank Oz who always is subtle and handles the most enjoyable Muppet characters . Besides acting , Frank Oz also was the person who directed and wrote the movie . The movie concentrates a bit too much on just the two main characters of the movie ; Kermit and Miss Piggy . Also the human cast gets wasted because of that but of course also most of the Muppet characters . They put ( too ) many Muppets in the movie but doesn't provide them with enough room to let them shine , or their characters speak out . They tried to do so by putting in some extra solo sequences , featuring some of the Muppet characters , which felt like a last minute addition but was amusing , though distracting , nevertheless . The movie also features Rizzo the Rat in his first big movie role but it's too bad that he didn't teamed up with Gonzo yet in this on . The movie could had really used another and distracting from the main plot , comical duo , besides Kermit and Miss Piggy . The movie yet again features many cameo from well known actors and other celebrities . Celebrities and Muppets always have been a great combination . Not only well known ( at the time ) celebrities make a cameo but also the " Sesame Street " characters do so , toward the ending . It's obvious that they used this movie as a vehicle to also use some new puppet techniques , that in my opinion however don't work out and are redundant . Showing the Muppet's legs when they walk , bad idea ! Putting someone in a Miss Piggy suit when she is on roller-blades , bad idea ! Though the movie is mostly forgettable it of course still features some great sequences such as the one with the Muppet babies . It also of course features some good comedy moments and it obviously makes this an enjoyable simple movie to watch but it's all not quite enough for this movie to really make a lasting impression . Out of all the Muppet movies this is probably the one with the most less re-playability factor .
484356	1416505	56639	6.0	Nothing too bad but the Dr . Mabuse series was obviously declining .	This is still a perfectly watchable Dr . Mabuse entry but unfortunately it's mainly the story this time that prevents this movie from being amongst the best in the long series of Dr . Mabuse movies , that started in 1922 with Fritz Lang's " Dr . Mabuse , der Spieler - Ein Bild der Zeit " and ended in 1972 with Jesus Franco's " Dr . M schlägt zu " ( unless you also count the unofficial 1990 entry " Dr . M " . ) . Wolfgang Preiss reprises his role as Dr . Mabuse for the third time and the character Joe Como and the actor portraying him , Lex Barker , from the previous Dr . Mabuse-entry " Im Stahlnetz des Dr . Mabuse " return in this movie again . It's a much needed presence since there isn't much that's connecting this movie with the previous entries . Perhaps it has to do with the lack of the presence of Dr . Mabuse in this movie and the absence of Gert Fröbe that this movie isn't as good as the previous entries . It also is quite confusing again that actors from previous Dr . Mabuse return in this movie but in totally different roles . The story just isn't much good or special this time , which is the main reason why this movie is unfortunately not as good as any of the other previously released Dr . Mabuse movies . There is no real criminal master-plan by Dr . Mabuse this time , at least nothing too solid or believable . The first part of the movie is just about an invisible man who spies and scares a girl . Oh that crook ! This is not what in essence the original Dr . Mabuse were all about . I also don't think that Fritz Lang would had been too happy with this movie . Yes , of course the movie does get better as it progresses though . The series sort of choose its own path during the ' 60's and it turned more into a funky typical ' 60's crime production . Sort of more like the James Bond movies , so to speak . Nothing wrong with this approach of course but you can wonder of it was the right approach for Dr . Mabuse movies , that in its earliest entries were still full with surrealism and were actually more horror movies then crime-mysteries . There also is a lack of mystery and thriller elements this time . At times it even feels like the movie is more like a comedy . Like always , it's kept a mystery throughout the movie who is Dr . Mabuse , even though he is being portrayed again by the same actor who played him 2 times before . Quite silly of course . Nothing too bad , just not as good when being compared to any of the previous Dr . Mabuse movies .
484684	1416505	264616	6.0	A decent movie but hardly worthy of its good reputation on here .	This is a decent movie at its very best . It's very well watchable but as a genre movie its too lacking in its story and execution of it . With all of its praising this movie is receiving on here , it surely is a bit of an overrated movie . Problem for me while watching this movie was that I knew that this was simply the type of movie in which nothing is what it seems , which made me all the more aware all of the time , making me see lots of the twists within this movie from miles away already . The movie was just being a bit too obvious with its intentions and what directions it was heading toward . The movie therefore wasn't really being very surprising , despite having more than a few twists to its story . Also a bit too many perhaps . It's best to have one big twist at the ending than to have multiple twists throughout its entire story . It's just less effective and powerful . Guess its a good enough first theatrical directorial movie debut for Bill Paxton , who doesn't provide the movie with a good style or distinctive atmosphere but nevertheless sets the right mood and knows to tell the story , despite the story not being all that great . The movie never made it to most cinemas though and its not hard to see way . The movie is too typical for its genre and it doesn't stand out in any way . Movies like this get made by the dozens each year , especially during those days and there simply are far better and more surprising genre movies to watch out there . For his first big movie Bill Paxton knew to get some big names involved . It makes you wonder though if they would had also agreed to this project hadn't Paxton been involved in it . Matthew McConaughey and Powers Boothe are some big name actors but also the crew has some big names in it , such as the director of photography Bill Butler . It's also hard to see what the movie and its story try to achieve really . Are we supposed to be sympathetic at the end and which side are we supposed to be on ? The movie perhaps in the long run leaves more questions than answers really , which makes the movie a bit of an unsatisfying one . No , it's no bad movie but it's also far from a must-see as well really .
484810	1416505	74331	6.0	Joyce Van Patten's 15 minutes of fame .	Joyce Van Patten ( yes , indeed Dick Van Patten's sister ) is a big unknown actress who mostly works for TV related projects . Perhaps this was her biggest role as of yet ? It also is apparent why she mostly works for TV and doesn't star in many movies ; she just isn't a very great actress . In most cases a Columbo movie features a well known and established actor in the role of the murderer , who usually has some very good interaction with Peter Falk and his sluggish Lt . Columbo character . Obviously this just isn't the case with this Columbo movie , which is also the foremost reason why this isn't among the best the Columbo series of movies have to offer . But of course the acting is not just the only problem . Another serious problem is the movie its directing , which is way too simple and formulaic . Robert Douglas also used to be a director who spend almost his whole career working for television , directing many different episodes for many different TV-series , of which some were popular and of which some where just plain unknown . His directing style is typical for TV and uses lots of static shots , close-ups , zooms and simple establishing shots . Also most of the supporting actors are just plain horrible in this movie , so it can also be said that Robert Douglas was not really a great actors director either . It's not like the story is bad though . It's actually a quite good written episode and story-wise even a step-up from writer Peter S . Feibleman's previous already fine written Columbo movie " Columbo : Fade in to Murder " , staring William Shatner . The movie also features some good and the right amount of relieving humor . You can say that it's the story that really saves this movie from being a bad movie but also just can't prevent it that this movie is a tad bit below par , when being compared to most of the other Columbo movies . It luckily also isn't among the longest Columbo movies , since the movie tends to be a bit overlong in parts and starts to drag during some of its sequences . It often could had gotten more swiftly to the point . Even though the movie is still pleasant to watch , it just isn't the fastest going one .
483832	1416505	18368	6.0	Laurel & Hardy in one of their first teaming ups . I wish I could say it also was one of their best . .	The movie is amusing enough but it's far from being the best Laurel & Hardy silent comedy shorts . The movie is at certain points dragging to much for that , especially toward its stretched out ending . It's a movie that certainly does have its great comical moments but not quite enough to really stand out as a comedy . The movie has a fun premise and some good comical moments and situations . However these moments and situations are rather stretched out in this movie , which causes them to be too long with as a result that it loses some of its comical power . This especially is the case in the ending of the movie , which takes too long . It makes the movie as a whole also feel too long , even though it of course is shorter than 20 minutes . But yes , the good moments in this movie certainly make sure that you'll still be entertained by this movie as a whole . The boys are in good form in this movie , which was one of their first teaming ups as a comedy duo . Especially Stan Laurel is in his element , while Oliver Hardy was still clearly searching and developing his character . It was a bit weird to see the boys without hair but unlike Samson , they don't lose any of their power . It's always fun to see James Finlayson in a Laurel & Hardy movie , even when it's a silent one . I thought I also noticed Walter Long as one of the convicts but I'm not too sure of this , also since he isn't credited . Slightly disappointing when compared to Laurel & Hardy's other work but entertaining enough to watch nevertheless .
484088	1416505	209163	6.0	More of the same but it's welcome !	This movie is a typical sequel , meaning that everything is bigger . More action , more special effects , more comedy , more new characters and more different plot lines . Is it all better ? Perhaps if the movie was more original and not so much an extension of the first movie , then perhaps it would had been . If you enjoyed the first " The Mummy " , you'll probably also enjoy watching this movie . It's in the same style and follows the same characters , with just a few more new adjustments to it . Not all are for the best though . Compared to the first movie , this movie obviously has an highly budget and it uses this for some more big scale battles , at the beginning and end of the movie . It also puts in some overall more action sequences and more traveling elements , which helps to provide the movie with its fun and adventurous feeling . They also tried to put some more layers into the story , involving the same characters from the first movie but none of this ever really works out , since these plot line differ way too much from the characters as we got introduced to in the first movie . There also are some new characters in the movie . The O'Connell's now have a son . Why oh why do movies always feel the need to put in kids into the story . As a matter of fact the character is quite entertaining in the movie but at the same time annoying because he just feels so completely redundant . Luckily John Hannah is still present for the comical notes of the movie and Arnold Vosloo as the charismatic mummy . This is the role he definitely will be remembered for , even though it isn't a very demanding role . Very much like the first movie launched the careers of Brendan Fraser , Rachel Weisz , John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo , this movie launched the acting career of The Rock . Yes he's painfully horrible in this movie , despite having no lines but he's such a great new action hero star . He definitely is the new Arnold Schwarzenegger , who obviously also wasn't the best actor around but still a big and popular one . It was also fun to see Alun Armstrong in the movie , though he's hard to recognize . Also Patricia Velasquez's role has been extended , which is a welcome thing . Like most sequels , it's tries ( too ) hard to surpass its first movie , in terms of size and spectacle . Yes , it provides the movie with some great moments but yet the movie feels more of the same . It's not a bad thing , since the movie is still perfectly fun and entertaining but its lack of originality and new ideas is disturbing at times and makes me worried for " The Mummy 3 " , if there is ever going to be such a movie . The ending is sort of an anti-climax , when a computer animated scorpion king appears , that looks nothing like The Rock and looks as if it came straight out of a playstation game . It's a bit of a disappointing ending but luckily the rest of the movie is good enough to compensate for this and still make this is perfectly fun and watchable movie .
484311	1416505	36218	6.0	Entertaining enough but lacking in action and tension .	This movie is entertaining and good enough but from an Errol Flynn movie you would normally expect some more fireworks . The story for most part is good but the movie is lacking in both some action and real tension , which makes this movie a bit of a bore to watch . The movie begins well and promising . The story seems solid but some unlikely and ridicules events in the story almost completely ruin the movie its story and credibility . Especially the ending is disappointing as well as ridicules , when the Nazi's are building a complete bomber from the parts that are in a couple of crates . It's ridicules and helps to make this movie a bit of a disappointing one . The movie also begins to drag pretty fast after the promising beginning . The second halve of the movie is especially a bore , when it starts to drag on for too long . Still it entertains enough to make this movie still a watchable one . Errol Flynn plays his character well and convincing and proofs that he can still play a great leading man , even when the movie itself is a lacking one . The movie would had been a so much better one if it had had some more action and tense moments in it . It instead now falls flat as well as an action movie as a WW II thriller . The story itself is original and interesting enough , had it not been filled with so many ridicules moments . It's also sort of ridicules to see how morally right and the Errol Flynn character is but that is sort of a trademark for all the characters he ever played . And of course the Nazi's in this movie are made out to look as ruthless cold-hearted villains . It's pretty obvious that this movie was of course a piece of anti-Nazi propaganda , released in 1943 . Still watchable , as long as you don't expect too much fireworks from it or of Flynn .
484536	1416505	1103965	6.0	What a bleak show .	" The 80th Annual Academy Awards " shall go down in history as the show that almost wasn't there and the year without any surprises . The evening was nothing too bad but it all was just so standard and also the winners themselves didn't really gave away any memorable speeches or moments . While watching this I couldn't help wondering ; How good would they show had been if there was still a writer's strike ? Because of the writer's strike , this award show got almost narrowed done to an evening that would show montages from previous Academy Awards ceremonies and the winners being announced in between . It's obvious that they still implemented some of these montages in the actual show and to be honest , the montages were also the best moments during the evening . It showed all the previous movies that ever won for best picture and lots of winning actors and actresses as well as a couple of humorous montages such as one that paid homage to binoculars and one about waking up after having bad dreams . When especially compared to other years , there were hardly any political jokes or statements being made . Not even a lot of Obama , Clinton or Bush references . Not by presenter Jon Stewart , nor by any of the award winners . Not even any Iraq references were being made , other then of course the nominated documentaries , focusing on Iraq . Jon Stewart himself did a fair enough job as the evening's presenter . He had a couple of good fun moments but for most part of the evening he was just standing there filling up the gaps and announce the next categories . There was hardly any improvisation involved . Blame it on the writer's strike ? Most likely yes , for also the award presenters themselves hardly said anything , funny , good or memorable . All of the usual suspect were also present handing out the award , also no big surprises or anything memorable there . The only surprising thing perhaps there was Owen Wilson , who a couple of months ago attempted a suicide attempt . Guess he just wanted to show his face that he was still around and ready to make his Hollywood return . But also then again ; what's the point of letting him present something if he isn't going to do anything funny ? Basically all he did was entering the stage and said ; the nominees are . . . and the winner is . And as for the winners , well really were there any surprises ? The only thing perhaps was Marion Cotillard wining best actress in a leading role for " La Môme " . But other then that ; " No Country for Old Men " winning best picture , the Coen brothers winning best director , Daniel Day-Lewis winning , Javier Bardem winning and so on . None of the categories provided any surprising winners . Besides " No Country for Old Men " , the other big winner of the evening was " The Bourne Ultimatum " for winning three out of three Oscar ' , even though not for the most important categories obviously . Some great filmmakers spend their entire directing career without winning an Oscar ( Hithcock , Kubrick ) . I just can't help that I lost some of the respect I had for the Coen brothers after appearing on stage for each of their 3 wins , including best picture and best directing . I always thought that they were a couple of awesome young dogs who only made movies they really wanted to make but as it turns out they are pretty boring individuals . They acted like this was a normal every day for them and the Oscar was not a big thing for them . Perhaps the nicest winners of the evening were Diablo Cody for winning for best original screenplay for " Juno " , who was genuinely happy and emotional and Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová for winning best original song for " Once " . It was nice that they won , since it was a simply made movie , made on a shoe-string budget and with a couple of camcorder but became an huge success nevertheless . It also was nice that they allowed Markéta Irglová back on the stage to make her acceptance speech , after being cut off by the music before . Perhaps a good idea to give EACH of the award winners the time to make an acceptance speech ? I think it's quite disrespectful that in the case of three winners , only one is given the chance and time to make a speech . I mean , some of these people will probably never win an Oscar again . so please let them just enjoy this moment . Interesting thing to notice was also the amount of international winners , from outside the English speaking countries . It shows that not the best movies and filmmakers are all come from Hollywood and film-making has become a real universal thing , perhaps more than ever before . But really , do you always need to make a WW II to get nominated for best foreign movie ? When is this going to change . It was nice for Austria to win their first ever Oscar for " Die Fälscher " but they really need to broaden their view on foreign films , since there are so many other nice films around , concentrating on totally different subjects . Forgettable show , without any surprises , which perhaps is also a good thing since this doesn't annoy - or make anyone mad about things .
484661	1416505	381125	6.0	About as good as a 2 minutes short can get .	When you are going to watch a 2 minutes short animated film you know it is not going to be a masterpiece unless it has a good joke at the end . Unfortunately " Date Double " doesn't has this . It sounds weird for a 2 minute short but the movie is a bit too long . After about 30 seconds you have already seen it and you are waiting for it to end . It is good for a few laughs but it is just not something I rave about and tell my friends to have a quick look at it on the Internet . The quality is good although the voice recording is not top class . You can hear that none of the voice actors where in the same room at the time of recording . They say their line's without really acting to anyone , at least it sounds that way . Not a bad short film but no must see or anything .
485584	1416505	48528	6.0	A late swashbuckler that forgot to be entertaining .	It isn't until the end that the movie turns into a spectacular and true swashbuckler . In between there are too many long moments in which basically nothing is happening . Also often the action just seems to drop out of nowhere and the movie features some awkward and forced humor , that perhaps even is a bit embarrassing to watch . But hey , everyone knows that the greatest swashbucklers were not made in the ' 50's . The story is just a great one . It's an absolutely top-class and solidly constructed story . It had lots of potential in it and interesting characters and motivations . The movie however never really fully uses all this potential You can't help when looking at this movie thinking how much better it all could had been , or at least more entertaining , if it just went that one step further . The movie gets obviously restrained by its low budget but that's no excuses in my opinion . The directing is rather bland and imaging-less . Strange though , since Richard Thorpe is obviously a capable director . The love-story feels forced , as if it was simply a needed ingredient . It of course always has been a part of the swashbuckler genre but in this particular case they would had been better off skipping it , since it's simply not believable in the story and there is no chemistry between the two lovers , played by Robert Taylor and Kay Kendall . The end still makes up a lot for the movie , when the main hero and villain are clashing their weapons , while swinging in a bell tower . Great swashbuckling stuff . The movie has some great characters in it but non of them quite work out , since they are being portrayed too formulaic . You know this is the sort of movie in which the villains all wear black and the good guys are all colorful and stuff . A shame , since it again , showed some real good potential . Robert Taylor did a good job , although he really ain't no Errol Flynn . He also was perhaps a little bit too old for his role already . He was 44 at the time and he really looked like it . It's also not hard to see why Kay Kendall nothing really had a sparkling career , though her early dead in 1959 also of course contributed to this . Not a that bad movie but the Sir Walter Scott novel deserved a better treatment .
484540	1416505	66931	6.0	The murder without a body .	This Columbo movie is quite different , since it doesn't actually feature a body . Yes , there has been a murder committed but halve of the movie spends its time on actually establishing if really a man had been murdered , since there are no traces , except an eye witness who saw the murder from a great distance . Of course we as the viewer already know what has happened , since we got to see it , as always , right at the start of the movie . The movie is not really about the murder but more about the murderer trying to cover his tracks . This is a different approach from other Columbo movies and while its interesting it doesn't work out as good as the usual Columbo movie approach . Because of the approach of this movie , the character of Columbo himself gets also pushed quite much to the back , which is of course a shame and a waste of Peter Falk , who always had been excellent as the character Columbo . But also on top of the , the story of this movie just isn't that good . Nothing bad but everything is a bit too obvious all . The perpetrator makes himself unnecessary a suspect by giving too obvious hints by saying things with double meanings to Lt . Columbo . It's highly unlikely that a respected clever man such as Maj . Gen . Martin J . Hollister would ever do such a thing . Normally a Columbo movie also often distinct itself by featuring a clever ingenious story . None of that is the case within this movie . The movie would perhaps had worked out better if it had some bigger names in it . Normally a Columbo movie often features a well known actor in the role of the murderer but Eddie Albert is not really a well known big established actor , despite the two Oscar nominations he has received in his career that spanned from the ' 30's till the late ' 90's , consisting out of mostly TV work though . The movie has a typical ' 70's style but mostly in its visual look . The ' 70's look of course by todays standards is a completely silly one . Not that it matters much for this movie but I would had preferred as it always had a more distinctive typical ' 70's style , apart from its look . Because of its different approach , slightly below the usual Columbo movie standards but its still a good enough movie to watch .
484026	1416505	48387	6.0	Late Fritz Lang movie doesn't know to impress - or even entertains .	Of course Fritz Lang was one of the greatest directors in the ' 20's and ' 30's , with movie classics such as " Metropolis " , " M " and " Dr . Mabuse , der Spieler - Ein Bild der Zeit " but the movies he made later in his career , from let's say the ' 40's on are hardly on par with his work from his glory days . You see a lot of directors that were great and brilliant in the earliest days of cinema ( ' 10's / ' 20's / ' 30's ) take a deep nose dive with their later movies . So far the only director that I know of that has remained consistent throughout the decades , from the ' 10's till the ' 50's has been King Vidor . Seems like Fritz Lang was stuck somewhere in the ' 20's or ' 30's with his directing . The directing and compositions for this movie are very old fashioned , which makes the movie now days feel quite outdated . It's quite static all but perhaps this was also due to the obviously restrained and limited budget of the movie . Still good to see that the sort of signature dark , uneasy atmosphere by Fritz Lang also is present in this movie . However you can wonder if this type of atmosphere is really suited for a movie like this . At times I even expected the movie to turn into an horror movie , which was purely due to its atmosphere ! Lets face it , the swashbuckling genre was quite death and dried up already in the ' 50's . There were some attempts to revive the genre at that particular decade but all failed . This movie is no exception , although you can debate about it if this truly is a swashbuckler . It just lacks the much required action , even though by the ending the movie finally starts to take pace and takes some adventurous forms but by that time it's already quite to late to still make this movie an highly entertaining or exciting one . There just isn't enough happening in the movie ! The movie could had gone into some interesting directions ( such as with the ' Redbeard'-plotline ) but it just doesn't ever does so . It's always risqué to tell a story almost completely from the view point of a child . It's an approach that rarely ever works out in a movie . Frtiz Lang , perhaps over confident with the success by him from the past , makes an attempt to pull it off with this movie . At first the movie still concentrates on the child but soon he makes room for the Stewart Granger character , who also soon but slowly starts to turn in the true main character of the movie . Good move , since this movie is too dark and fun enough to watch for children and adults won't find it interesting to watch a movie such as this one completely from the view point of a naive young boy . The movie features some good and fairly well known actors in it but they fail to give the movie a real heart and make the characters come to life , at least not to a point that they're interesting , entertaining or good enough to care about . It doesn't help that the main character played by George Sanders is character that starts off as a bad guy and just nothing becomes really a good guy throughout the movie . He always remains a sort of a betraying and heartless scoundrel . You just never really start to care about him . Perhaps the only thing that surprised and impressed in this movie was the musical score by Miklós Rózsa . It was really beautiful and perfectly adventurous . The sort of score that really suits the swashbuckling genre . The score only deserved a better movie ! It's a soundtrack worth searching out ! In the end its a fairly enjoyable movie , that's however too old fashioned and not exciting enough to consider this a real good - or true adventurous movie .
484365	1416505	73820	7.0	Typical but fun and good all .	These ' 3-in-1 ' type of horror movies were quite popular in the ' 70's . Even though they are never truly brilliant movies ( the stories told within it are simply too short for that ) but they are always enjoyable to watch . This movie is also like that . Movies like this don't get made now days because now days they are replaced by horror / thriller television series . At least that's how I see it . It has 3 totally different stories , with different characters and set at different places . What they all have in common though is that they all star Karen Black as the main character , in one case in even more than one role . She is fine actress for the genre and this movie . She is a bit of a cult-actress , also due to her looks . She plays all the characters totally differently in this movie , which shows her wide range of skills as an actress , even though she isn't the most talented one within the business . Credit for that also needs to go to the make-up department , who for every story totally changed Karen Black her looks . The stories are not all classic horror ones in the most common sense of the word . Perhaps psychological thriller would be a better way to describe the movie its first 2 stories . Ironicaly the third story , that is an horror one , is also the best - or at least most memorable one of the movie . Despite of their short running time , the 3 stories also aren't among the fastest paced ones . It takes its time to build up things and this case that works out quite well for the stories . None of the stories are really something remarkable but what they all have in common are some good ' suprise ' endings , even though in some cases you should be able to see the endings coming from miles away . You could tell that director Dan Curtis had a real love for the genre . His approach is typical for the genre , especially during the ' 70's . Unfortunately as a director he was mostly stuck with television movies , such as this one was as well . 21 years later he also made a sequel to this movie , called brilliantly " Trilogy of Terror II " . Just like this movie , it got made for television . Because it's a television movie you also shouldn't expect any blood or gore . All of the stories are quite ' clean ' and the horror and tension mostly comes from the stories themselves and its atmosphere . Recommendable , especially of course for the fans of the genre .
483731	1416505	372784	7.0	Batman re-imagined .	It's interesting to see a whole new different take on the Batman franchise . All of the previous Batman movies are ignored and this movie completely re-imaginings the story and the character of Bruce Wayne / Batman . I'm sure that the fans will like this new different approach towards the franchise . The character of Bruce Wayne / Batman is even darker and more sinister than in any of the previous movies . This is also the first time that the character of Bruce Wayne is much more interesting than that of Batman himself . It explores what it is that drives Bruce Wayne to fight crime in his batsuit . The movie unfortunately tries to cover a bit too much of his story . The story covers too much and a lot is happening in this movie . The movie tells how Bruce lost his parent , how he was trained , how he returned to Gotham and reclaimed all his property and in the mean time he fights many criminals such as Carmine Falcone , the Scarecrow and in the end another villain but who that is , I'm not going to spoil for you . It simply is all too much to just tell in one movie . There isn't one main villain which makes this movie a bit too hard to understand at times . I'm sure this is all that the fans wanted but from a storytelling point of view the movie is flawed . Because it covers so much , not everything always flows well or feels connected to each other . The story lacked a main plot line and only towards the ending the movie gets a more steady and clear story-line . There also are too many characters introduced in to movie . The movie could had also used some more humor . The movie takes itself too serious most of the time . There is some humor in the movie but that humor feels rather forced and childish / lame . There are two different kinds of darkness in movies ; atmospheric dark , like in the ' 89 version was the case and just normal dark , which in this movie is present . I prefer the atmospheric dark personally . I think they took ' dark knight ' perhaps a little bit too literally . The movie was simply too plain dark at times , without doing much good to the atmosphere . Strangely enough Gotham City itself wasn't dark enough looking . The Gothic Tim Burton look that made Gotham City such a memorable and imaginatively place is surely missed in this movie . The movie is superbly and impressively cast . Christian Bale is good as Bruce Wayne but not always as Batman . Michael Caine is a great Alfred . There was much hate towards Katie Holmes towards her role but that had more to do with her strange Tom Cruise affair than her acting abilities . I thought she did great in this movie and she portrayed a strong but sensitive female character . Other wonderful actors in the movie are Liam Neeson , Gary Oldman , Tom Wilkinson , Morgan Freeman and Ken Watanabe . Cillian Murphy truly surprised and impressed me in his villainous role . Like many others I thought , before seeing this movie , that he wasn't the right actor for a role like this one but he simply was more than great in his role . Another great surprise was Rutger Hauer . I already knew he was a great actor and it was wonderful to see him in a big production again . He plays a kind of character that suits him perfectly , a hard businessman , that also can be seen as a small villain part . There is some good action in the movie and some great fights but nothing really memorable though . I'm sure it was all very impressive to see this on the big screen but at home it all just doesn't look that impressive . I'm beginning to sound awfully negative about this movie but that's just because I simply didn't enjoyed this movie as much as everyone else seemed to had done . I feel that the movie is seriously flawed at times , mainly with its story but still I rate this movie a which by no means is a weak rating of course . It means that I still enjoyed most parts of the movie and am still anxious to see this new Batman franchise continued in the near future .
485534	1416505	56335	7.0	I enjoyed it ! A great light-movie to watch .	Of course this movie is being often compared to " The Great Escape " . The similarities between the story lines are striking and some of the sequences are almost exactly the same . Only keep in mind that this movie was actually released a year before the great escape and this movie its story is based on the real events as lived by Charles Coward , who also served as a consultant for this movie , while " The Great Escape " is based on a totally other true story . The movie is not an heavy confronting WW II POW movie . Instead its more of a comedy at times with almost slapstick like events and characters . It does make the movie a bit unbalanced and silly to watch but for me it also made the movie very light and easy . I'm not really sure though what for a movie this was supposed to be ; A comedy or a drama . It's too incoherent and unbalanced to really say . The movie is obviously low-budget but they used some creative solutions to hide this , in the movie . The main character is really fascinating . He is being played by Dirk Bogarde , who of course is always a pleasure to see as the main lead , regardless of the role he plays . The rest of the characters are a bit muddled in and simply not interesting enough . The movie also changes often of setting with as a result that new characters get introduced and old ones abandoned . All in all its not a terribly memorable movie and certainly no classic . The movie is too incoherent for that and the most of the character too uninteresting . Nevertheless this is a great movie to kill some time with . Nothing heavy , just some good old fashioned light-entertainment , with some good moments . Worth seeing if you get the chance .
484436	1416505	337978	7.0	Doesn't really feel like a Die Hard movie but it's a great action flick on its own .	Just what I had feared after watching its trailer for the first time ; this movie doesn't really feel like its part of the Die Hard movie franchise . Main reason for this is its approach . All of the previous three Die Hard movies had a certain realistic action approach . The movies at all time felt like these events as portrayed could really occur one day . It didn't tried to overdo things and put in any overblown action sequences , even though some moments were still rather far fetched to say the least . And then there is " Live Free or Die Hard " . In this movie John McClane battles a F-35 on an highway with a truck , fights an Asian chick in an elevator shaft will hanging in a van and crashes a car into a flying helicopter . It sort of tells the approach of " Live Free or Die Hard " . It features mostly overblown action sequences and the movie , as well as definitely its story , are far from believable all . But there is nothing wrong with this all , since this movie is still a great action flick on its own right . Still I'm somewhat disappointed that the movie sort of lacks the same feeling and approach of the previous Die Hard movies . What makes " Live Free or Die Hard " a great movie in its genre are its stunts . The movie knows to come up with a couple of highly original action moments and an even better execution of it all . Len Wiseman shows that he's a man who knows how to handle the action genre . But yes , even so I still wished John McTiernan had directed this . The movie is good looking with a nice visual ( though it was a bit too dark in parts perhaps ) style , which looked like they had a serious budget to spend on this movie and they did a good job with the money . The story and its main-plot is overall pretty good but only problem with it is that it's filled with some stupidities . This unfortunately ALWAYS happens when Hollywood decides to make a movie involving high tech computers and other technical aspects . Some things are just not possible as portrayed in this movie while others are just utterly ridicules ( Really , press the delete button to make hacker leave your computer ? ) . Hollywood always spends lots of money on hiring experts who tell them what is really technically possible and what's not but amazingly they all time ignore these advises , all in the best interest of the story and flow , at least in their opinion . I of course can somewhat understand this , since sometimes you just have to simplify a lot and make things happen without having to spend too much time explaining why . But this doesn't take away that the story of this movie is an at times pretty silly one to follow . But oh well , logic just isn't one of the requirements for an action-flick . Bruce Willis is well over 50 but with this movie once more shows that he can still handle an action movie , also as John McClane . The character hasn't changed much , he still manages to get his shirt very dirty only he has lost more of his hair by this time . I have always liked Timothy Olyphant as an actor and I really loved him in " The Girl Next Door " but I had my doubts if he was already ready enough for a big villainous role in a movie such as this one . He was good enough in his role but unfortunately he wasn't exactly among the most or best movie villains of this or any other decade . Did they ran out of Gruber brothers already ? All in all , I can really recommend this movie as a superior mindless action flick . And after all , a movie that features a nice Boba Fett reference ( of course also involving the Kevin Smith character ) just can't be all that bad , even though the fans of the previous three Die Hard movies might still feel a bit cheated by this movie its style , approach and handling .
484591	1416505	70634	7.0	Not the most spectacular Dracula movies but yet it's also one of the more solid ones .	This is the eight Dracula movie entry from the Hammer studios , which began first in 1958 with the movie " Dracula " and ended in 1974 with the movie " The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires " . All of these Dracula movies are of variating quality but they all have in common that they are entertaining to watch , like basically every Hammer movie ever made . There is a bit too much talking though at times and not enough ' action ' , so to speak , though toward the ending this certainly changes . It doesn't make the movie dull or anything but still makes it feel a b bit overlong . Nevertheless the movie has a good and original enough story . The movie does a good job at putting the old fashioned Dracula character into ' modern ' 1974 ( even though the movie itself already got released in 1973 ) . This is something most modern horror movies could learn from . The story mixes the occult with the Dracula legend , combined with some modern police work . Peter Cushing once more plays a true excellent role as a decedent of the good old Abraham Van Helsing . A character he played numerous times before throughout his career . Christopher Lee also reprises his role again as the famous blood-sucking count . It would be the last time he would play the character , though he played vampire characters again in later movies . It was a real worthy last Dracula performance by him . As often the Dracula role is also really restrained in this movie . He doesn't even show up for the first time when we are already well halve way through the movie . Nevertheless its always great seeing Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing acting in one and the same sequence together . The movie besides also features a fine British supporting cast with some fine actors . The movie is well directed by Alan Gibson , who also directed the previous Hammer studios Dracula entry " Dracula A . D . 1972 " . The movie further more features some wonderful editing and camera-position at times , like you would expect from an ' 70's movie . Also surprising good was the musical score by John Cacavas , that suits the movie real well . The movie knows to create a good and also certain tense and mysterious atmosphere . It adds to the reason why this movie is such a perfectly watchable one . It surely a movie that entertains withs story , characters and actors which are portraying them . A great Hammer movie !
484439	1416505	43709	7.0	Original early thriller by John Sturges , starring Ethel Barrymore in a late role .	The movie begins like a very typical Victorian-like costume movie , with real ladies and gentlemen but soon the movie makes a thriller turn , which makes the movie as a whole a surprising and fine contrasting one . It has a real good thriller story , that above all is also really original and everything gets uplifted all by its settings and time-period it is set in . Even though this movie was from 1951 , the movie certainly looks and feels like a ' 30's / ' 40's movie . It's in black & white , has Victorian settings and has ' 30's / ' 40's big time movie star Ethel Barrymore in it . The style of film-making and the way things are set up are also done in an old fashioned , as the overall visual style and atmosphere of the movie . Basically the only thing that gives away that this is a ' 50's movie is that Angela Lansbury is in it as well . It's an early thriller that works mostly out because of its original as well as intriguing story about a ' poor ' man and his wife and baby who are kindly given shelter by an elderly lady . Only thing is , he doesn't want to go away and soon start taking over the household and takes the command , especially when some of his ' friends ' show up as well , without giving much more away of it all . The story makes this movie a sort of an ' unpleasant ' one to watch . of course in a positive and effective way . It provides the movie with a constant certain tension and not knowing what will happen next . But lets not overpraise this movie too much , fore it's definitely not the best or most perfect movie within its genre . The story and directions it is heading in are at times a bit too simple for that and also the restrained settings prevent this from being a true genre classic . It's a good and original early movie within its genre and it deserves to be known better but not really a movie you must see before you die or anything . The movie is directed by John Sturges . The man best known for directing movies such as " The Magnificent Seven " , " The Great Escape " and " Gunfight at the O . K . Corral " . So he's not really a man that is widely known for his thriller making expertise and it sort of makes it a shame after watching this movie that he didn't made any more thrillers in his career , since he obviously had the right talent and skills for it . The movie features Ethel Barrymore in a rather late role of hers . She is best known for her roles in ' 30's and ' 40's movies , as is she known for being the sister of John and Lionel Barrymore . Sort of funny that she once more plays a character in this movie who is mostly sitting on a chair and lying in a bed , as she also used to do in many other previous roles of her . But she plays a good role in this movie , even though I just never have been the biggest fan of her . Maurice Evans also plays a good early typical thriller villain with a brain . It was also nice to see a still quite young Angela Lansbury in this movie . Never thought I would see Angela Lansbury and Ethel Barrymore in one and the same movie together ! It's a kind of a surreal image . Definitely a movie that deserves to be better known and seen by more !
484830	1416505	382189	7.0	An European independent movie , that is all too aware of it .	I wanted to see this movie for a long time . I recently finally got the chance to see it and although it was a good movie , it was not the must-see I heard it was and I expected it to be . This movie was praised at all kinds of festivals and website's that are respectable and thrust worthy when it comes to the ' better smaller ' - , mainly European movies . Needless to say that my expectations were high , maybe a bit too high . " My Summer of Love " feels like a fabricated movie that is all too aware of its own style , which makes the movie feel forced and too artificially made at certain moments . The story and premise are good enough . The story feels very pure and the two main characters are good enough to carry the entire movie on their own , which they also get to do . I don't know , for some reason movies with a ' lesbian ' love-story always feel so much purer and perhaps sweeter than any other love-stories . So it's not really the story that is the problem but it really is the way it is told . " My Summer of Love " is directed by a Polish director and made by a mostly English crew . It has European style written all over it , especially when it comes down to its cinematography ( shakycam , sudden zooms ) . The cinematography all feels too forced and planned . It's not pure enough and it's all very calculated . The cinematography of the nature and the more ' quiet ' sequences are good and the capture a nice mood but for 70 % of the movie the cinematography simply feels too fabricated . The way of cinematography doesn't feel necessary and it doesn't add enough to the movie . It feels like its only used to make this movie distinct itself from the more ' Hollywood ' way of film-making . At times it feels like they wanted every sequence to be pure poetry . The movie also feels incomplete . All of the sequences are too short and they end abruptly . The movie has some interesting plot-lines in it but the sequences are handled in are too short to make a lasting impression . I wanted to see and learn more about certain plot-lines and characters but the sequences were over before I fully realized what happened and what was going on with the characters . This is also the reason why this movie only is 86 minutes short . The movie doesn't cover enough of the story and because of that the movie feels incomplete and perhaps at times makes a dull and a too simple impression . Because it's all ' too short ' , the movie never really knew how to capture and set the right mood , of the boring country life in a small English town . It was not like I didn't understood or ' got ' this movie , it was just that I wasn't grabbed by it all and it didn't made a lasting impression on me . The ending also didn't really came as a surprise . The movie constantly gave me the feeling that something wasn't ' right ' , so I expected a twist at the ending , which also came . So even though the ending itself wasn't predictable , the build up to it still was . The acting is quite good and pure . Nathalie Press and Emily Blunt are good enough as the two young leading ladies but what will they be doing in 10 years from now ? Probably not acting . They are pure but they aren't really actresses . But for this movie that's OK really . I mean that probably also was the reason why they were cast in the first place . I know I'm probably sounding too negative and harsh but that simply is because the movie just wasn't as good as I heard it was and I expected it to be . The movie is still good and pure enough to please the fans of ' European ' cinema but too many moments in the movie feel too fabricated . I probably make the movie sound worser than it is , so please if you're into this sort of movies , watch this one as well . It's a movie worth seeing that still has plenty to offer its viewers . It's a good movie but not the best example of recent good and pure European film-making .
484701	1416505	60782	7.0	Not hard to see why this movie has become sort of a semi-classic .	A scarcely dressed Raquel Welch , a cat-fight and Ray Harryhausen dinosaurs . What more do you need to have a good time ? This movie is better than it's remake , that's for sure . The movie was remade only 4 years later , under the title " When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth " . This movie in itself is also a remake of the 1940 movie with the almost similar title " One Million B . C . " , starring Lon Chaney Jr . and directed by Hal Roach and his son with the original name Hal Roach Jr . This is not the sort of movie you would expect from the Hammer studio's . Not only its concept and settings differ from their normal horror productions but also the atmosphere is totally different and it doesn't at all feel like an Hammer movie . Guess this was the touch of director Don Chaffey , who was more experienced in making entertaining and adventurous productions , such as for instance the classic production " Jason and the Argonauts " from 1963 . There isn't much story present in the movie , or perhaps I was just too busy staring at Raquel Welch's breasts . It's just the one prehistorical event and fight after the other basically . The movie is made more in a documentary sort of style . But that's OK , this isn't really the sort of movie that requires a story . It's sort of funny to see ' giant ' real iguana's , turtles and tarantulas being presented as big prehistoric flesh eating monsters . It of course makes the movie look terribly outdated this present day but it at the same time is also part of the charm of these sort of movies . ' Historicaly ' it of course doesn't has any value . The stop motion-effects for the dinosaurs and the dinosaur battles were done by none other than Ray Harryhausen , who was at the top of the game at the time . The effects are also good looking in this movie and also surely provide the movie with its most memorable and classic moments . The dinosaur fights are definitely more classic and better known than the actual movie on its own . Next to its effects , the movie is also otherwise a good looking one . I liked the settings and costumes and all , though it always remains sort of funny in these sort of movies that the actors all seem to have perfect white teeth . Good fun prehistorical nonsense , that features all of the elements you would expect .
484628	1416505	241527	7.0	A decent start of the series but also clearly one of the lesser Harry Potter movies .	No , I'm not a big Harry Potter fan and probably never will be but I can appreciate the qualities of the movies . Definitely for a children movie this movie is of course of very high class , with fabulous looking sets , a whole load of well known British actors and an highly experienced crew involved . The movie forms a nice first set up for the future series of Harry Potter movies . Still I'm glad the movies and its characters have matured a lot since this movie . Probably also has to do with the fact that this movie and the second were directed by Chris Columbus who is an experienced children movie director , while the other Harry Potter movies were directed by more ' serious ' directors . Yes , it makes this movie a good children's movie to watch but also sort of makes this movie look and feel more outdated than any of the other Harry Potter movies , which also goes at the expense of its re-watchable value . Nevertheless , " Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone " remains good quality - and fun film . It knows to create an entire new world of its own with lots of often strange characters in it . The movie is of course a set up and the first establishment of a long running series of movies . This means that the movie consists for a big part out of character introductions . Yes , this results in the fact that there are a bit too many characters in the movie , also since some of them don't even seem to serve a purpose at all for the story but this got resolved in the later movies , by simply leaving out some characters but by introducing many new ones as well . So its sort of problem solving with another problem . Also a bit of a shame that the movie is lacking a real central villain . Professor Snape is treated as a villain , even though we learn by the end of the movie that he's not such a bad guy after all . The real main villain if the movie is of course Voldemort but he gets mostly only mentioned by name and basically doesn't do an awful lot in the movie and only sort of shows up in the very end of the movie . Not the way to treat a villain in my opinion , even though its of course clear from this movie on that he is going to play a much bigger and more important role in the future Harry Potter movies . I however in a case like this feel that they should had putted in a new and different villain besides Voldemort , since this movie is definitely lacking a sense of danger , excitement and action , even though the movie never bores , despite its quite long running time ( for a children's movie anyway . ) . The movie its quality is also surely being uplifted by its presence of well known and respected actors , such as Richard Harris , Maggie Smith , Robbie Coltrane and Alan Rickman among many others . Each of them are giving fine performances but it are mostly Harris and Rickman that catch the eye with their performances . The child actors are also managing fine , although its definitely and luckily true that their acting improved throughout during the later movies . The movie is great looking and knows to create a magic new world , with its set , costumes and make-up . It's not hard to see that this was a costly movie to make . The special effects are also mostly fine , though not really during the game of quidditch , or any other ' flying ' sequence for that matter . The movie gets also greatly supported by the musical score from John Williams . Sort of a waste for the series that Williams only scored the music for the first 3 movies . A good and fun enough start of the series , though luckily the movies improved more over the years .
484285	1416505	443543	7.0	Good movie but definitely a case of style over substance .	No doubt that " The Illusionist " is one of the best looking movies of 2006 . Great sets , costumes , cinematography and such but the story left me mostly cold and in fact was quite poorly told and developed at times . So definitely a case of style over substance this one but what a great style it is . What I especially loved about the movie was its authentic feeling . The movie was made in fairly much the same style as back in the early days of cinema . Of course all of the sets and costumes and such also add to the authentic feeling of the overall movie . Neil Burger obviously has a love for the movies from the early days of cinema . I however found to be the story quite simplistic , with a love-story also done in about the same way as in the earliest movies . It's admirable but not really good and interesting enough for an 21th century movie . The story also doesn't bother to explain everything , which leaves a lot to the viewers its own imagination and assumptions . Its a good way to make a movie but in this case it just leaves a bit too many questions in the end . The movie is also lacking too much in proper tension , mystery and real surprises . I for one already exactly knew how this movie was going to end halve way through the movie . The story and overall movie also don't always get properly developed . It's like the movie is stuck at times and Neil Burger still has got a lot of learning to do when it comes down to telling a story exciting , intriguing and suspenseful . The story now just couldn't grab me , though I guess that in its core it had potential . Perhaps the movie felt like it was stuck at times because of the reason that the movie is mostly set at constantly the same locations , for most part . The movie also uses its special effects too much as a tool to tell the story with . It's in huge contrast with the authentic feel of the movie . It takes away some of the ' magic ' of the movie , since you just know its not real and not a real magic trick you're looking at . It also takes away some of the charm of the movie and its subject . The best action and intriguing aspect from this movie comes from Paul Giamatti as Inspector Uhl , though his character really doesn't get developed in the best way possible . His character constantly changes during the movie . At times you like him , at times he's more the villain and at times he just confuses you what his motivations are . Nevertheless , Paul Giamatti is absolutely fantastic in his role and he also shows how incredible versatile as an actor he is . I wouldn't had mind him seeing being nominated for an Oscar again for his role in this movie . But of course opposing is Edward Norton who also does more than a great job as the main character of the movie . But before I'm starting to sound too negative ; " The Illusionist " is definitely a movie worth seeing , that however is too weak and simplistic to also consider it as one of the best movie in recent years , like the current rating here at the moment might suggest it is .
484443	1416505	110428	7.0	Visually a great movie with great performances .	" The Madness of King George " is far from an excellent movie and a must see but nevertheless it's still both fun and wonderful to watch . The costumes and sets are great and Sir Nigel Hawthorne really carries the movie with his wonderful performance . The movie is more of a comedy than a drama really . The movie is filled with some humorous moments , dialogs and characters . Only problem I had with the movie was that it focused on way too many and unneeded characters . Also because of this , Sir Ian Holm's character gets seriously underused . A bit of an ungrateful role for Sir Ian Holm . They could have used his acting skills in a better manner . Basically the movie is just a little bit over 1 hour and 40 minutes of fun entertainment with some nice humor and an impressive Sir Nigel Hawthorne .
483817	1416505	346293	7.0	Helps you understand how one man could gain so much support and power .	" Hitler : The Rise of Evil " can be seen as a documentary with actors . It is interesting and educative to watch but too compressed and political correct at times . This TV movie could have used so more guts . Robert Carlyle was impressive as Hitler , helped by some subtle make-up effects . It's too bad that the rest of the supporting cast doesn't know to impress . Most of them just stay empty character with faces but without names . Peter O'Toole's small roll however was nice . The character the movie focuses on aren't always logical , it fails to focus on the interesting key element persons and those that are present are mostly nothing more as small cameo's . It is interesting that this movie also has some impressive WW I sequences in which Hitler fought as a soldier . The movie helps you to understand ( not sympathize ) how a man such as Hitler gained so much support politically and from the German people which is mainly why this movie is educative and important for people to see to help them understand . It's too bad that the movie stops just when it gets interesting , it was almost like they ran out of money and had to came up with an ending quickly . Interesting and educative .
484735	1416505	381192	7.0	A fun adventurous movie !	To me this movie was a nice little surprise , I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected . The movie is fun and adventurous and surpassed my expectations on several fronts . The movie is cleverly written by Gerard Soeteman who manages to put in some good jokes and funny witty dialog . Soeteman also was responsible for writing all of Paul Verhoeven's Dutch movies and the TV-series " Floris " starring Rutger Hauer on which this movie is based . Of course this movie is nothing like the black & white TV-series from the late ' 60's that launched the career for both actor Rutger Hauer and director Paul Verhoeven but than again , this movie doesn't pretend to be like the TV-series . The movie is set in a different time-period and even though all of the characters are meant to be granddaughters and grandsons of the original characters from the TV-series , this movie and its characters feel good and original on its own . It's like all the characters had gotten a modern refreshing remake . The villains are deliciously stereotypical evil , dumb and just totally over-the-top . Yes , the movie does also feature a love-story but in this case it is totally not distracting at any moment and is handled nicely . This movie has Dutch written all over it . I mean when persons are fighting in a mill while they are throwing cheeses at each other , you know you're watching a movie set in The Netherlands . Also of course weed is a thing not to be missed in a Dutch movie , this one included . Most of the jokes are ' inside jokes ' that I'm sure only Dutch adults will notice and appreciate but I seriously laughed out loud at some moments . I think an international audience will not appreciate this movie as much as Dutch people will . The story is simple so that also the young ones will be able to follow and appreciate this fun adventurous movie . The fights and sword fights might be a bit of a disappointing thing of the movie but all the fun characters and the cleverly written jokes compensate for this and make you forget the weak story and the just totally ridicules moments . I enjoyed this movie from start to finish and was pleasantly surprised by it all . Another thing that surely surpassed my expectations was the acting . Especially Michiel Huisman , Victor Löw and Daan Schuurmans were truly excellent ! I truly enjoyed their performances in this movie . It's quite unique for me to say that I enjoyed persons acting performances in a Dutch movie , so I think that says a lot about this movie ! Even though it is notable that this movie hasn't got a major budget , the movie stills manages to create a little epic feeling , due to the nice and beautiful settings . It gives the movie a wonderful adventurous feeling and atmosphere . ( especially towards the Dutch people here ) You should give this movie a chance ! It really surprised me how incredible lighthearted fun this movie was . Fun adventurous entertainment from start till finish !
484152	1416505	120520	7.0	Not entirely my cup of tea but it simply is a good , well made movie .	I'll confess that this is not entirely my favorite genre . I like some British costume drama's , as long as they have some quirkiness added to it , such as for instance is the case in such movies as " Barry Lyndon " , " The Draughtsman's Contract " and " Dangerous Liaisons " . This movie is more in the style and mind of a Jane Austen novel , which is just not the type of movie for which I sit down and enjoy watching . But nevertheless that doesn't mean I'm totally blind for the quality this movie got made in . Its Oscar nominations ; Best Actress in a Leading Role , Best Cinematography , Best Costume Design and Best Writing , Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium , are all certainly ones I can agree with . Add to that the costume design and you have the 5 elements that make this a good and certainly perfectly watchable movie . What I like about the story is that it features an original love-triangle . It's not the type of love-triangle you would just expect and it also makes the movie as a whole original not entirely predictable to watch . It's well layered and executed in the movie . It however perhaps too long for the movie to take shape . Basically the first halve of the movie totally couldn't interest me and it was standard , slow and just not that interesting . However the second halve , from the moment on the movie gets set in Venice , really made up a lot for me . The movie is set at the early 20th century , which is not the most usual time period for this type of movie . However , if you would had told me the movie was set in the late 19th century I would had also believed it . Basically it are only the cars and phones that give away that this movie is set in the 20th century . The rest of the movie just feels and looks the same as any other costume drama set during a more common earlier time period . The sets and costumes for this time period are just fantastic . Not just for the Venice sequences but also really for the sequences set in London . The movie is also not as heavy handed as it might sound and as you perhaps would expect . The movie mostly remains on the shallow safe side , until heads toward its very ending . It often makes this a bland and rather formulaic movie to watch , despite its hospitality . I think you can blame director Iain Softley , who directed his movie rather static and standard . Or perhaps blame the ' 90's , which just wasn't the most style-full period for movie making . A good and certainly watchable movie , that perhaps should had been a bit more bold and edgier in its execution .
484866	1416505	54443	7.0	Brilliant story but pretty weird execution of it .	The story of the movie is highly original and quite brilliant however the execution of the story by German director Wolf Rilla ( who apparently now runs his own restaurant in Southern France ) is not something I'm happy about . The movie's pace doesn't always flow really well and is incoherent . We jump from one scene to another without any obvious connection . Still the movie is a strong piece of British science-fiction / horror . The story itself is what makes this movie a classic . The movie is not really a scary one but more one with a mysterious atmosphere . You never know what is going to happen next or how it is going to end all . The beginning and the end are the strongest parts of the movie , especially the mysterious beginning is one to remember . The good British acting is top-class . Especially the young Martin Stephens does an amazing job as ' leader ' of the children . He was pretty scary and unreal at times . Not really recommendable for the casual viewer , this movie is too old fashioned for them , however if you're a fan of the genre this is a must see .
484357	1416505	37099	7.0	Definitely a step up again from the previous mummy movie entry .	This is a definitely better movie than the previous Unviversal movie entry " The Mummy's Tomb " , from 2 years earlier . The story and characters are better again this time . Although this doesn't mean that the actual story is really that much special but at least they definitely put some effort in it . It's of course a quite silly story and it gets sort of tiresome how they keep bringing back the mummy back to life time after the time , no matter how often they have killed him off already in the previous movies . Same goes for the Andoheb role played by George Zucco . But oh well , at least the story keeps the movie enjoyable to watch . There aren't really any slow or dull moments ever in this movie . The movie features both John Carradine and Lon Chaney Jr . again in the role of the mummy . They were both like THE Universal horror movies stars at the time . It's not that they roles are that interesting within this movie but nevertheless their presence is enough to uplifts the movie and makes it all the more enjoyable to watch for the genre fans of the Universal ' 40's movies . Unlike the previous Universal mummy-entries , this movie does not feature an happy end , in which our hero kills the mummy and gets back the back . This was quite surprising and also a reason why this movie is better than just the average and typical Universal ' 40's horror attempt . The movie has some good typical Unverisal ' 40's horror moments . Of course it's nothing too scary , at least not by today's standards but it's very classy and good looking all , with the use of shadows and some handy camera-work . A perfectly watchable mummy-entry .
485215	1416505	7	8.0	Gentleman Jim in live boxing action .	The fact that Edison and co . had gotten James Corbett to appear in front of the camera must have been a big break for them . Corbett was the heavy weight champion at the time ( he had just defended his title against Charley Mitchell , prior to this movie ) and he on top of that also was one of the most popular and best known boxers at the time . He's better known under the nickname Gentleman Jim and is being credited as the ' father of modern boxing ' . He is being portrayed by Errol Flynn in the boxing movie " Gentleman Jim " , from 1942 . In this boxing match he is competing against an ' underdog ' , Peter Courtney . Originally the entire movie consisted out of six one minute rounds to be displayed all one by one but now days only a small portion of only a few seconds of the movie has survived . A real shame , since I'm sure that boxing fans now days are still willing to pay an handsome amount of money just to see James Corbett boxing a whole match . Still it must also be noted that the fight was probably fixed though in advance . The Edison Manufacturing Company needed 6 rounds , so Corbett was probably holding back a little during shooting . In the surviving bit of the movie you can see him deliver some punches , in his very powerful and technical superior ( at least for its time ) way . It wasn't the last boxing match in front of a ' camera ' Corbett appeared in and after his career he actually became an early movie star but not a real successful one though . So this movie is not the only one that shows Gentleman Jim in live moving action . Filming boxing matches was actually the most profitable thing they ever did for the movie pioneer boys from the Edison Manufacturing Company . As a matter of fact , this particular movie was actually the most profitable one they ever made during the kinetoscope era . Because boxing was illegal in some states at the time , they could sell these shot boxing matches , which could be played on a Kinetograph ( lets say a 20th century TV-set ) . People then were able to view a match , for a certain amount of money . For this purpose they founded the Kinetoscope Exhibiting Company , which also developed and created new special kinetoscopes , which could play movies of a minute long . Before this the movie could only display movies for 30 seconds tops . This wasn't the first boxing match they had filmed and that honor must go to " Leonard-Cushing Fight " , from earlier in the year . It's great to see the legendary Gentleman Jim in live action in this movie , or what is left of it though .
484098	1416505	338094	8.0	Perfect horror entertainment for children .	As weird and as unexpected as it might sound , I really liked this movie for what it was and it's no way as bad as everything tries to make you believe it is . I thought that this was just a great children movie . Or well , maybe it's just because this would be the type of movie that I would had liked to have seen when I was young ( er ) . People just often seem to forget or ignore their inner child . While watching this movie you just have to think and feel like a child again , since this is also the target group the movie got aimed towards . When you do so , you'll see that this movie is simply good at what it tries to achieve . It brings some good clean and safe horror entertainment for children . Young ones often seem to like reading horror stories ( at least in my days this was the case ) so they are likely to get a blast out of watching this movie . Some sequences however might be a bit too disturbing for really young children though , so be aware of that . Of course when you start watching this movie as an adult you'll notice the movie its weak and quite formulaic story . Nothing is ever really surprising about it . The movie nevertheless has a great sense of adventure though in which a group of people gets trapped in an haunted house , with a new adventure in every room . The movie is great looking , with also especially its special effects . Normally horror and special effects are never a good or effective combination but in this case of an horror movie for children , it isn't really a complainant . The special effects mostly serve to give the movie its feeling of adventure and it provides the movie with some of its entertaining moments as well . The movie also features some or the recently deceased Rick Baker make-up effects , which is always something great to look at . Not sure if the movie is really as effective as a comedy than as an adventure movie though . Oh well , perhaps children will still find the movie funny in parts , though some of the jokes are obviously aimed toward adults . Something Disney movies often do so , especially lately . I also can't say if I'm too sure about Eddie Murphy casting as the main lead . Now I have nothing against Eddie Murphy really but he just isn't suitable for all types of comedies . I think this is one of those movies that would had been better off without him . Besides the well known Eddie Murphy , the movie also features well known and respected actors such as Terence Stamp , Nathaniel Parker and Jennifer Tilly . Especially Stamp and Parker were great . On top of that the movie also features the wonderful Deep Roy , in a really small role though . The movie its musical score by Mark Mancina also really deserves recognition . It was surprisingly great and effective . It can be described as a great and effective horror score as well as an entertaining one . Great children entertainment !
483740	1416505	95497	8.0	Christ , the man of flesh and blood .	Whenever I watch this movie I have the feeling that it's closer to the truth than for instance a movie like " The Passion of the Christ " . This movie feels more realistic , mainly because of the way the Jesus character is portrayed in this movie and overall the movie and its story feels far more believable . In the movie Jesus is portrayed as the son of God but as a human of flesh and blood as well . He has hopes , feelings and dreams like every other man . The story is absolutely fascinating . It's a whole different take on the life of Jesus and the person as well . Lot's of things of the famous story have been changed to a more believable and likely story , without too many supernatural elements but with lots of personal struggles and doubts from Jesus about his mission . Jesus is beautifully portrayed by Willem Dafoe . Also good in their roles were Harvey Keitel as Judas - , this movie also provides a totally different view on his character , and David Bowie as Pontius Pilate , in a much smaller role than you would expect from his character . The movie is filled with some unforgettable , original and though provoking moments , especially towards the ending when Christ gets his ' last temptation ' . It clearly is not a movie for just everyone . Obviously there will be still lots of people who will be offended by the portrayal of Christ and many other different characters from this movie . But also because the movie is quite artistic and almost poetic like at times in its thought provoking moments , it might be a movie that will simply seem ' odd ' to some . So clearly not a movie for just everyone . Still I want to recommend it to everyone so everyone can form their own opinion about the movie its story and characters afterward . Whether you like this movie as a movie , or not , isn't the most important thing . It's the way you feel about the story and the character of Jesus that matters the most afterward . I think this is also what the filmmakers tried to achieve with this movie .
485079	1416505	56823	8.0	Finally after 40 years receiving the recognition it deserves .	Before 2002 this movie was very rarely shown . Producer Alfred Heineken ( better known as Freddie Heineken , yes indeed THE big man behind the famous Dutch beer brewery ) had forbidden all public showings of this movie , with the exception of a few cinematic showings and one appearance on Dutch television . Reason for this was that his mistress Nan Los played in the film . So in a way this movie has always been hidden for the public till the death of Heineken in 2002 , a shame because it's a pretty good war drama ! The first halve of the movie is very standard stuff . Typical WW II Dutch drama stuff you can say . The second halve however was very good ! The story became tense and even mysterious and had a few surprising twists and a very excellent ending ! Lex Schoorel is a very irritating leading man as Ducker however as Dorbeck , who is also played by him , he is strangely enough very good . It's no coincidence that after this he appeared rarely in any other notable movies , with the exception of the television show " Floris " directed by Paul Verhoeven and staring Rutger Hauer and the failed but well known movie " Grijpstra & De Gier " also with Rutger Hauer and Rijk de Gooyer . The rest of the cast consist mainly out of fairly unknown actors with the exception of Sacco van der Made and Piet Römer who received most of their fame in the 90's . All of the acting performances reminded me of those from Hollywood movies made in the 40's and 50's . The movie besides looks even more outdated because it's in black & white . The editing is at times very weird and the sound is also pretty messed up at times . This movie is certainly not as good as Fons Rademakers other Dutch war drama , the Academy Award winning movie " De Aanslag " with Derek de Lint and most definitely not as good as Paul Verhoeven's masterpiece " Soldaat van Oranje " . But the second halve and certainly the ending make this movie a very solid war drama with an excellent story . Worth seeing if you get the chance .
484856	1416505	439	8.0	Historical important and influential movie .	This movie is one of the first narrative shot movie , with scenes that all add up to each other and are used to tell a story with in a linear way . Quite unique for early 1900's standards . Back in that time period , only short sequences were always shot , mostly documentary style . It was never really used as a tool to tell a imaginary story with . It however is not just one of the very first narrative movies but also one of the earliest , if not earliest Western-movie . The storytelling is really great , though the story and movie itself is absolutely simple . It's just basically about a bunch of bandits who rob a train and the passengers on it . Is the movie itself really that good to watch ? I don't think so . It's very simplistic but it remains interesting to watch nevertheless because the movie gives you a feeling , for the entire running time , that what you're watching at the moment is unique , revolutionary and historically important , for the further influence on the future of modern cinema . In that regard this movie is a great classic must-see for the movie lovers - and buffs . The movie is fast paced with some action as well . The movie features a chase and a couple of gun fights , with a great classic last shot . It makes the movie perhaps more spectacular to watch than you at first sight would expect , from a movie made in 1903 . Really not the greatest classic movie to watch but historically very interesting and unique and for that reason an absolute must-see .
484226	1416505	30127	8.0	A warm movie .	This is a movie with a very warm and pleasant atmosphere . It has a childish innocence over it , like basically all these typical genre movies from the ' 30's seem to have . It's atmosphere , story and characters make this a very pleasant and entertaining movie to watch . It has a very simple concept , in which a French baker's wife run of with a shepherd , after the first night they moved in to a small village , in the middle of the countryside . After this the baker refuses to make bread anymore . The villagers of course want their daily fresh bread so they together come up with a plan to get her back to the bakery . It all sounds very simple but thanks to its fine storytelling from director Marcel Pagnol it all works out real well . There also is of course more to the story , courtesy of some fine input from the movie its characters and actors portraying them . It's a well cast movie , with French character actor Raimu in the main lead . The other cast members all have some very characteristic look over them , the way only the French can look . I'm not too happy about the casting of Ginette Leclerc though . She is supposed to be a very pretty woman in the movie but just look at the way Leclerc look . . . she is no natural beauty . Or perhaps her looks just were the idea of a true beauty , in the France of the 1930's . It takes a while for the movie to pick up its pace and the movie also tends to drag on a bit in its middle part but in the many parts that the movie finds its right pace , the movie is a great one . It's a real enjoyable comedy , that is not the type of comedy that has some hilarious moments that will make you laugh out loud in it but it's more the type of comedy that tries to constantly entertain . It doesn't fail at that , thanks to the movie its very pleasant atmosphere , simplistic story and likable characters . Especially the movie its last halve , in which the villagers start to undertake action , is just great . A fun and warm little movie .
484183	1416505	69906	8.0	Chess is a dangerous game indeed .	It's nice that the movie tries some new things for a change . For instance it introduces the Columbo character first into the movie before the murder has even occurred and he starts to investigate before they have even found a body . We don't even get to see how the crime unfolds fully at the beginning but there is a good reason for this as later becomes obvious . It also in a way is more or less a sequel to " Columbo : Étude in Black " , of one year earlier . Normally a Columbo movie doesn't refer back to anything that happened in previous Columbo movies but this one does , with Lt . Columbo , his dog and Dr . Benson . The movie also doesn't feature a lot of interaction between Lt . Columbo and his suspect , a formula normally used in a Columbo movie . This is an element that might disappoint some of the Columbo fans . At moments like this the Columbo character is normally at its best when he puts pressure on his suspect or tries to gain his trust by playing dumber than he of course obviously truly is . The Columbo character himself also looks ' cleaner ' than normal and is it me or is his trademark raincoat in a different color , or at least in some sequences it looks like it . Of course different doesn't also mean better but in this particular case I didn't mind some of these changes , since the movie obviously still worked out and can be regarded as one that is on par with most of the other Columbo movies and even slightly better than just the average ones . It's also thanks to the settings and acting that this movie worked out . As dull as it might sound but I like chess and movies featuring the game and world of chess always have a certain typical atmosphere over it , of certain high intellectuality and true gentlemen but at the same time , tension , suspicion and rivalry . Peter Falk is in good form again as Columbo and it's one of his better acting jobs as the shabby police detective . It also helps the movie that it features Laurence Harvey as the movie it's prime suspect . He is in great form , in one of his very last screen roles before his death in 1973 . It's a fine written and directed movie . The story isn't the most clever or ingenious ones , at least not when being compared to the best and most memorable Columbo movies but it's a story that doesn't bore and still provides plenty of surprises and entertainment , even though this movie doesn't feature as much comical relief as was the case in some other Columbo movies , which in my opinion is a positive thing . The movie features a good build up , to a fine ending . The directing is mostly formulaic and by the book but also features some good dream like sequences and other more different elements that are consistent with the ' 70's and less standard way of making movies . I like it as a sort of different Columbo movie .
485382	1416505	70003	8.0	Still one of the scariest Dracula versions out there .	It's the combination of the ' 70's - and dark horror atmosphere that makes this movie such an highly effective and great one . It's a real shame that this made for TV Dracula version , based on the Bram Stoker novel , is not any better known . The movie has an amazing dark atmosphere that adds to the tension and horror of the movie . This is a true genuinely scary horror movie and definitely amongst scariest of all the Dracula movies out there . The movie uses some great settings . Despite the fact that this is made for TV movie , it's not a cheap looking film . They did a real good job with this and its low budget can be seen nowhere back on screen . It's certainly true that the movie uses a bit too many zooms into the characters faces and all but that all was part of ' 70's film-making when film-makers experimented a lot with cinematography . Perhaps it was also an homage to the old days of horror cinema . Technically its a fine made movie by TV director and horror expert Dan Curtis . Too bad that the acting is also quite laughable at times . And no I'm not talking about Jack Palance as Dracula . I actually quite liked him in his role and I think he did a good job with his interpretation of the character . Too bad that he never played the famous count again after this movie , despite having several movie offers to do so . All the other actors in this movie aren't obviously amongst the most experienced or talented ones . I especially disliked the way Nigel Davenport portrayed the Dr . Van Helsing character . It's not like this movie version is adding anything new with its story to the Dracula movie legacy . As a matter of fact it's rather leaving out stuff then putting in some new elements . For instance there is no Renfield character in this movie or any mentioning of him . If you're familiar with the Dracula story or any of its movies you'll notice that this is a movie version that runs pretty much by the book with its story . A version truly worth seeing !
484125	1416505	206442	8.0	Artistically a well made movie .	This is artistically a well made and good looking movie but due to its different techniques and approach being used , that's different from the western way of film-making , this movie is also a hard one to watch in parts . The first halve of the movie is mostly hard to follow . Basically all you see are people walking around and talking . It's often hard to fully understand what is going on and were the movie and its story is heading to . It however soon becomes obvious that this is a movie that is based on the well known Gaston Leroux novel ; The Phantom of the Opera . But no , you can't really regard this movie as a Chinese version of The Phantom of the Opera . It's more a reinterpretation of the novel and it picks some different angles with its story . This is a fairly unknown and rare early Chinese production and also very little about this film is actually known . It nevertheless is listed at many places as you movie you simply have to see and I can understand why , even though this movie is not completely a successful one really as a movie . Time has not always been kind to this movie and some of the movie its quality has been lost . The quality and used techniques of this movie makes the movie seem older than it in fact really is . I'm not only talking about the types of camera's being used by also the editing , camera positioning and overall directing style . Also the music and sound often doesn't sound right and seems out of place and as if it got added in a much later stage . movie got made in the ' 30's , it looks more like it had been made 20 years before that . Asian movies in general often look older than they really are due to its techniques . It's for instance also the reason why most Akira Kurosawa movies look as if they were made in the ' 30's , while in fact they were made in the ' 50's . Of course this has changed , since the world now is much smaller . The second halve of the movie is definitely the best when it mixes its ( romantic ) drama with horror elements . The movie and its story then soon starts to get truly powerful and the movie becomes an even bigger pleasure to watch . It was already a pleasure to watch this movie due to its visual look , even though time hadn't been kind on the overall quality of the movie . It using fine , almost at times expressionistic looking sets , which probably had more to do with the budget restrictions of the movie . The movie is artistically more interesting to watch than movie-wise really . It's acting is obviously over-the-top and also one of the reasons why this movie is more outdated looking and feeling than it's 1937 release date would suggest . The actors obviously weren't movie actors but who can blame them , since in the ' 30's China there of course really wasn't a movie industry . It also got made in the same year as the second Sino-Japanese war started between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan , though there already had been some fighting going on between those two , years before the actual war started , so no big surprise really that this movie got made with limited resources and both cast & crew involved obviously didn't had much experience yet in the movie business , though director Weibang Ma-Xu on a very regular basis , had been making movies since 1926 on and continued to do so till his early death in 1961 . It's an interesting movie to watch .
485064	1416505	190590	8.0	Fun nonsense .	What a stylish and fun movie this was ! The movie was different than what I expected . I expected a weird movie with a typical style similar to maybe a Tim Burton movie . The movie however had a very easy to watch style which makes this movie very accessible to watch for all people . The story is filled with some wonderful and comical situations and not so likely characters . The cast does a very good job although in my opinion George Clooney was at times overacting a little . Holly Hunter is always a pleasure to watch and I really loved her in this movie . Two fun small unforgettable parts are played John Goodman and Michael Badalucco . I also enjoyed seeing Wayne Duvall in this movie , I never really liked him as an actor in his role in " The District " but he really impressed me in this movie . A very fun and stylish , easy to watch , movie .
485112	1416505	57197	8.0	Good old fashioned fun !	As entertainment this movie is perfect . The movie is a fun adventurous one , with lots of spectacular moments and fights . From a technical point of view this movie is even a masterpiece . The stop-motion scene's created by special effects pioneer Ray Harryhausen is simply brilliant and makes this movie one of the most influential and important one's , when it comes to special effects . But also the movie uses clever camera tricks and some well made miniatures . Yes , of course the effects all look out dated now but they still surprisingly , look convincing enough and at times they are even still simply breathtaking and spectacular to look at . Especially of course the legendary , fantastic end fight against the skeleton warriors . The story is like good entertainment should be ; Adventurous , exciting and simple to follow . The movie truly is none stop fun entertainment to watch with lots of spectacular moments with the legendary skeleton fight as the ultimate highlight . You don't have to be a fan of ' classic ' movies in order to enjoy this movie , everyone should be able to appreciate this movie and be entertained by it , especially when you are a fan of ancient Greek tales . Something that is not praised enough of this movie is the musical score by Bernard Herrmann . The movie is not exactly filled with impressive and memorable actors . As many movies as I have seen in my life , I don't think I have ever seen any actors from this movie in any other movie , with the exception of course of Honor Blackman who will always be remembered for playing the Bond girl Pussy Galore in " Goldfinger " . But this movie clearly isn't a character-adventure movie , it's a special effect adventure movie . The special effects are really the most important element of the movie . So for the fans of special effects this is especially most definitely a must see . A movie that should be fun and enjoyable to everyone , of all ages .
485083	1416505	241373	8.0	William K . L . Dickson greets the world for the very first time .	This is of course not the first film in history and presumably the Edison Manufacturing Company did dozens of test before actually shooting this and of course also shot " Monkeyshines , No . 1 " , 2 and 3 prior to this but it is the first film that was shown to a wide audience and press , at The National Federation of Women's Clubs , through a motion picture exhibition device the Kinetoscope , an invention of mostly William K . L . Dickson that let a strip of several images passing front of an illuminated lens behind a spinning wheel . Therefor this 3 second short plays an important part in movie history , as being the very first to be shown to an audience . The motions are perfect , though because of the shooting speed it all seems to occur in slow motion . There are no jerky movements and also the images is surprisingly clear . The film was shot with a Kinetograph , another William K . L . Dickson invention . He therefor is also credited as the inventor of the motion picture camera . The color white is shiny and the less dark colors of Dickson's clothing distinct itself well from the pitch black background used to film this . You can clearly see Dickson's face and also the more detailed look of his hair . Still I feel they could had done a bit more with the movement in this film . Show the audience some more of the possibilities of moving images . Instead now basically all Dickson does , is bring his hat from his one hand to the other , as a sort of wave toward the audience and he moves his head slightly , supposedly as a small nod toward the audience but that isn't all too clear to see . In a way this movie is a great metaphor for William K . L . Dickson and Thomas A . Edison literal greeting and welcoming us to the world of film . It perhaps provides the movie with just as much impact and significance , as it did 116 years ago .
485392	1416505	360486	8.0	A nice surprise . . . glad I've watched it !	With all the negative press this movie was receiving , I never was really much interested in watching this movie . Still for some reason I decided to give this movie a chance and I'm glad I did ! " Constantine " is spectacular and gorgeously visual looking . " Constantine " can be simply described as a mix of " The Exorcist " and " Blade " because well . . . John Constantine is a Blade like exorcist . For some reason this movie was poorly advertised . From the advertises and trailers I couldn't really tell what for a kind of character John Constantine was and what this movie was about , also since I never even had heard of the comic books this movie is based on . Had this movie been better advertised , I'm sure it would had attracted more people to see it . Maybe best thing about the movie are the special effects . They are truly most excellent , scary and gory at times . It makes this movie visual wonderful to look at . Also the atmosphere is better than expected . OK it ain't really a comic book kind of atmosphere but it's a good dark , almost horror like atmosphere . This movie works fine as an horror as well as an action movie . . . and as an anti-smoking campaign . The movie has more than a few spectacular and scary moments . The story is a bit too complicated at times . I don't think that the story itself is that complex but it's just the way it is told . Rookie director Francis Lawrence still has obviously some things to learn about movie-storytelling but nevertheless this is an impressive and most certainly entertaining debut movie from him . Keanu Reeves of course wouldn't had been my first choice as the hero but he pulls of alright . At least he isn't laughable unbelievable in his role or anything but he also ain't exactly cool enough . Rachel Weisz also pulls of alright but her performance certainly isn't worth all the praise she is receiving over here . In my opinion she really isn't believable as a cop . Can you just imaging her arresting a big tough criminal ? Really good were Djimon Hounsou ( finally in a ' normal ' role , I was getting sick of seeing him playing typical Africans like he did in for instance " Amistad " , " Gladiator " , " Stargate " and " Lara Croft Tomb Raider : The Cradle of Life " . ) and Peter Stormare as the greatly sarcastic Lucifer . Shia LaBeouf is also a good young actor with already an impressive CV . Surely a name we will hear a lot more about in the near future . Don't let all the negative press scare you off from watching this movie . " Constantine " is a gorgeously looking and entertaining horror / action movie .
484313	1416505	338751	8.0	Good biopic but not really fully worthy of all the Oscars and nominations .	This is a good movie but really not worthy of all that Oscar nominations . It's not among the best of 2004 and also certainly not among the best biopics of all time . But you have to give credit where credit is due . " The Aviator " is a good movie about an interesting man and an even more interesting life . With every other normal other director at the helm , more people would had been satisfied with the end result but since this movie was directed by Martin Scorsese , people expected more . What a pressure this must be for him . In the end Scorsese doesn't really delivers and his movie is lacking in moments of true greatness . This movie proofs that Scorsese's best years are behind him and that he is lacking in true creativeness in his recent movies . " The Aviator " feels as a formulaic done movie that follows all the rules by the book . It's wonderfully done but also because of this the movie doesn't ever really become a remarkable or very memorable one . Even though the movie is almost 3 hours long , it never drags . Leave it up to Scorsese to make a long , consistent movie , that never loses focus . The story is told with lots of pace and flows well , perhaps even a bit too fast at times . Some sequences don't feel complete and leave an unsatisfying feeling . At times I wanted to know more about a certain event or character . This is unfortunately often the case with biopics . Movies like this , often tell the life of one single person . How is it possible to put everything that happened in a lifetime , in a just under three hours movie . Of course the pace has to be fast and certain events have to be cut down , in order to achieve everything with the story . Still I feel kind of cheated afterward by the story . While watching this movie it becomes obvious that Scorsese admires Howard Hughes . He glorifies him as a movie-maker and aviator . The movie mainly focuses on his best years and too often too little on the negative aspects of the character . The movie also ends when Hughes was at his prime , when he starts to fall back again , the movie ends . Even though we all know how Hughes eventually ended up , I'm still of opinion that the movie should had shown this , in AT LEAST a prologue before the end credits . The movie also leaves lots of things unclear , regarding the main character . It's never explained why he was the way he was and how he got so mentally ill . The movie made it seem that he could be normal when he wanted and had to . It makes the character a sort of an inconsistent one , that we never fully get to understand . Leonardo DiCaprio does well as Howard Hughes , the main character . He proofs that he is not only a great actor but also can handle big roles and can carry a movie . Other actors that were really great in this movie were Alec Baldwin and a surprising Alan Alda . The rest of the actors feel a little miss cast . They all seemed to have been cast because of their names . This goes for Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe who play some very uninteresting roles . And Cate Blanchett seemed to had been cast because she's Cate Blanchett , not because she looks like Katharine Hepburn and Kate Beckinsale seemed to had been cast because she's Kate Beckinsale , not because she looks like Ava Gardner . This also goes for actors such as ; Jude Law and Gwen Stefani . But sure on the other hand the movie is technically near perfect . It's well looking and has convincing looking sets and costumes and it manages to recreate the atmosphere mainly of the ' 20's and ' 30's . Also great was the cinematography by Robert Richardson but I did not particularly liked the color use , for which this movie received so much technical praise . The special effects were also a big letdown . Why don't I ever hear anyone complaining about this ? The flight sequences , which are some of the most significant moments in the movie , looked far from convincing . The movie is compelling enough to make you keep watching it till the end , since its basically in the end still a very well made one . The end result won't disappoint you but it will probably still leaves a sort of a bad aftertaste , considering that the movie is not entirely a satisfying one . I don't think that " The Aviator " will ever grow into becoming a classic Scorsese movie over the next years , such as with his previous movie " Taxi Driver " was the case . The movie is too formulaic made for that and it too often choices the simple path . It lacks true creativeness . Still of course the movie is a great one , that is well made and is far better than any other average biopic / drama . But worthy of all its Oscars and nominations ? Sorry , I really don't think so . It makes you wonder , would this movie even had been nominated for that many awards if it was directed by a different director ?
485175	1416505	416449	8.0	The movie is exactly what it promised to be .	This movie never promised to be the ultimate and definite historical movie about the Battle of Thermopylae . the movie instead promised to be a visual spectacle with big effects and spectacular action sequences . The movie promised to be simple entertainment and entertaining it was . It's like how entertainment should be ; simple and deliciously over-the-top . " 300 " is of course a movie that deliciously goes over-the-top with its images and overall style . The Frank Miller graphic novel gets translated very well to the big screen in terms of its style and atmosphere . The entire movie is greatly comic book looking , with its backgrounds , characters and action . Just like the other Frank Miller graphic novel turned movie " Sin City " , the entire movie was shot in a studio , with the use of blue - and green-screen , to give the movie an authentic , unusual but beautiful and spectacular looking visual style . Its style and characters make sure that you won't ever take this movie serious , unless you of course really believe that the Persian army used big over-sized misshapen , mutant looking creatures , Xerses really had such a deep voice and all of the battles happened in slow-motion . If you have a hard time coping with this comic book style and way of storytelling and interpretation of history , don't watch this movie and stick to historical books instead . But if you're simply interested in good quality action and entertainment , this is the perfect overblown blockbuster movie for you . The story is simple and its basically about the Spartans standing their ground , attack-wave after attack-wave . The story trows in some more plot lines , involving King Leonidas ' wife Queen Gorgo , who tries to convince the council to send more military support to save her husband , who knows he's going to meet a certain death . The diversity between those two main plot lines of attack and mostly talking and corruption work out well . Had the movie only been purely action it would had become tiresome after a while , I am sure . Also especially since the action is mostly of the same . Every attack-wave they encounter more dangerous , better skilled and often also more ugly looking enemies . Like a computer game , in which you advance one level-up , after you've beaten the enemy . But yes , it's also a missed opportunity that they didn't stick to the true story , since it's far more interesting and in my opinion also more heroic as the story portrayed in this movie . But it's of course also more complex and because of that also possibly less entertaining . I've always been greatly interested and fascinated by the story of the battle of Thermopylae , so I've wouldn't minded some more accuracy but I can understand and appreciate the approach of this movie and its story of the famous battle . Still sort of too bad that they decided to go with a voice over that tells what happens on screen and what the emotions and atmosphere was . The images themselves should be powerful and perfect enough to tell all of this . Everything in the movie is just basically very black & white and doesn't get complicated . Meaning that the good guys are all extremely good and they look like perfect creatures , with perfect biceps and white teeth and the villains are extremely evil and look like monsters , also complete with bad teeth . Definitely true that the best parts were already in the trailer but the movie still has plenty of visual surprises and spectacular action in it . The idea and sight of 300 Spartans facing an over a million man large Persian army is both impressive as spectacular . The best parts are definitely the action sequences , that show the bravery of the Spartans and their fighting skills and tactics , against the poorly organized and trained Persian army . The acting by the way was definitely better than expected . From a movie like this you just don't expect grand performances . Gerard Butler was great as the roaring and heroic King Leonidas and David Wenham and Vincent Regan play some good supporting roles . Of course the dialog isn't much special but this again perfectly suits the comic book style of film-making . I don't think that is a movie that will ever grow into becoming a classic and therefor I feel that it's also slightly exaggerated that the movie is actually in the IMDb top250 . Nevertheless it's a movie that shall always remain perfectly entertaining to watch .
484851	1416505	36342	8.0	Pretty nice thriller for its time .	I wouldn't exactly label this movie as a film-noir but it's a pretty good ' 40's thriller , that has a nice concept , which of course gets handled magnificently by the master of suspense ; Alfred Hitchcock . It's not his best and also certainly not his most memorable movie but this says something more about the quality of the other movies he has done than about this movie really . Like basically every ' 40's movie it begins rather slow and it takes its time to set up its story and characters . However about halve way through , when things really start to take off , it becomes a great movie to watch . For ' 40's standards it's quite an unique little thriller . It knows to build up its tension with a minimum amount of resources . It has a nice story about average people . This is one of the reasons why the thriller elements work out so effectively . The movie isn't set at any strange places , with stereotypical characters . The places , situations and characters are all easy to identify with . The main concept itself is pretty simple but somethings this is all you need for a movie to become a good one . Its screenplay got even nominated for an Oscar . It's a nice shot movie , with some wonderful looking and constructed sequences , once you start paying attention to it . This is were Alfred Hitchcock was great in ; creating some solid , unique , great looking sequences , with its original camera-work , in which he could capture a lot of things and emotions and setting the right mood with for the movie . It also features some nice acting . What I like is that the characters are changing throughout the movie . It gives the movie some nice tension since it provides the movie with a certain feeling of insecurity and uncertainty . Especially Joseph Cotten did a great job with this but Teresa Wright is also a nice leading lady . Nice little minimalistic thriller , made great by its concept and of course wonderful and effective directing from Alfred Hitchcock .
484799	1416505	90576	8.0	Great Dutch drama .	The Dutch are not great at making movies but when they make a WW II movie it often is a little masterpiece . " De Aanslag " is a movie like this . " De Aanslag " isn't necessarily about WW II but more about the effects of it on a persons life and why things happen the way they do and how little things can effect a persons life for ever . Most of the movie's story is set in the years after WW II and uses flashbacks of things that happened in WW II to make more things clear and to show things from a different perspective from different individuals that were involved in the incident were the movie is about . It becomes more and more clear what happened at the night that collaborator Ploeg was killed but the Dutch resistance and more importantly why things happened the way it happened . The story also shows a detailed view of the Netherlands and their citizens the years and decades after WW II and how it still affected many . There are many great returning characters in the story and the acting is for especially Dutch standards pretty high . Derek de Lint who now is better know world wide for his role as Derek Rayne in " Poltergeist : The Legacy " is a great leading man that really carries the movie . The cinematography from Theo van de Sande who later did the cinematography for the movie hit " Blade " is great and sets a nice mood . The directing by Fons Rademakers is done wonderfully and it never makes the movie hard to follow even though at times it gets a bit complicated . Great Dutch Oscar winning drama with some memorable moments and a fantastic ending were everything comes together and gets clear .
485533	1416505	25413	8.0	Laurel & Hardy run in to a ghost . . . at least they think it is .	This is Laurel & Hardy at their very best . A silly story and simple story that relies heavily on the comical timing of the actors . Its a Laurel & Hardy short that certainly does not disappoint . The movie can yet again be divided into two separate parts . In the first part the boys meet up with a ship captain ( Walter Long ) who is looking for a crew . He has a hard time finding a crew , since the ship he owns is notorious among the sailors and is known to be haunted . The second part of the movie is set on the ship itself . It's the part in which the boys get into some hilarious trouble once more , this time with a ghost , who of course turns out to be not a real ghost at all . Both parts are different in terms of the humor that is used . But both parts are hilarious in their very own way . The both parts may not really connect with each other , which doesn't make this the most consistent Laurel & Hardy shorts ever made but the silly and hilarious humor compensate for this , more than enough . Another reason why this movie is better than the average Laurel & Hardy comical shorts is the presence of a couple of Laurel & Hardy regulars . Walter Long is great and bold as always . Arthur Housman does what he can do best , playing a drunk and Mea Busch is also present . Here presence might feel a bit out of place and perhaps even unnecessary but she just was a great comical actress , who also does provides some good laughs in this movie . The movie does really has some great comical sequences in it , mainly when the two boys are being confronted by the ' ghost ' and they start running and screaming , like a couple of 10-year old girls . It helps to make this comical short an highly amusing and memorable one . Good first part and a good second , make a good movie overall .
483845	1416505	48960	8.0	An adventure of great proportion !	The thing that surprised me about this movie was how big this production was . Thousands of extras and costumes and dozens of cameo's in a trip around the world . Unfortunately the movie has lost some of its power throughout the years . It is beginning to get outdated and it almost seems like a miracle these days that this movie has won 5 Oscar's including the one for best picture in 1957 . Especially the pace is outdated , there are some endless long scene's that just don't seem to end and go on and on . The movie is filled with cameo's ( the first movie ever ) . But I'm ashamed to say that I hardly recognized anyone . We are talking about 1956 here , those who were big stars back then are now long since gone . The only one I recognized was Sir John Gielgud , no I even didn't recognized Frank Sinatra or Marlene Dietrich . David Niven was in his element and was a great leading man . I can't say that I'm completely happy with the casting choice of Cantinflas as Passepartout but fortunately it doesn't ruin the movie in any way . The story is great and adventurous , there are countless fun and entertaining moments in this epic production .
485113	1416505	55824	8.0	Classic thriller that set the standards for later movies .	Many people know the 1991 remake but very few have actually seen the original . A shame because it is worth seeing - and to be known by more . In a way " Cape Fear " seemed ahead of its time which it was not . It merely was a trend setter for later movies . The movie feels like it was made the same way as thrillers are made these days . The movie doesn't rely on scary gory scene's and violence but more on the psychological thriller elements , it is thanks to Robert Mitchum that this works very well in the movie . He manages to put - , with his character , a certain tension in the movie . The ending is a bit of a disappointing and not really tense or exciting . Another complaint is the way the dialog is delivered , it is done way too fast almost as if the actors were in an hurry , there are hardly any pauses between the sentences . The famous musical score is from Bernard Hermann whose score was later reused for the 1991 remake , 16 years after his death . But the music wasn't the only thing that was reused , also the actors Gregory Peck , Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam reappeared in the remake . And then the question which movie is the better one ? In my humble opinion the remake is even better and more exciting . But judge for yourself which movie is the better one , both are recommendable .
485482	1416505	335266	8.0	Character comedy .	This movie is an unique movie that I would describe as a ' character comedy ' . This is not a comedy with forced humor in it , it is a comical , yet ordinary observation of two different people in a strange foreign world , who are growing more and more towards each other . The humor and warm feeling of the movie is in the every day things and the strange but yet realistic characters . This movie is just like real life ; slow and not every thing is always making sense or requires explanation . Sometimes things just happen , whether you like it or not . This is a movie that relies heavily on its two main characters played by Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray , two totally different characters who yet are ' attracted ' to each other . It's obvious that at lot of parts in the movie moments were improvised , especially in the Bill Murray sequences . But somehow director Sofia Coppola manages to restrain Murray ( something that most definitely is not an easy thing to do ) and molds him into the character she want him to be . The fact that Murray perhaps plays the role of his life is thanks to Coppola's directing . Coppola and Murray should definitely make more movies together in the future . It's logical that this movie received an Oscar nomination for best picture , since this type of movie is new and yet works so well and feels so familiar and honest . I'm sure of it that in the near future we will get to see more movies like " Lost in Translation " being made . Perhaps not the must see everyone makes you believe it is but still an unique , warm movie experience that surely is recommendable for everyone to watch , at least once . Chanches are you'll either end up totally loving it , or hating it .
483868	1416505	945314	8.0	Skilfully made realistic short film .	To put it simply , this is a really well made short film . It's only 10 minutes long , so it's obviously and notably restricted with its story development and characters but the movie does a very good job at telling the story in its limited amount of time in a very effective - and above all also realistic way . The movie is kept deliberately small , in terms of its dramatic elements and character emotions . It's the reason why the movie feels very real and warm , even despite of its depressing story and overall atmosphere . It's the main reason why I regard this movie as a very well made one . The editing still feels quite clumsy in parts . For instance the back - and forward cuts from the internal and external shots in a sequence don't always feel consistent . It feels like it's taking place in a totally different time-line and universe so to speak , even though it very well might had been all shot on the same day and on the same location . Some music in those sequences could perhaps had worked miracles . It at least would had made it more consistent . The movie also uses one or two too many fade outs right in the middle of the movie . I never have been a big fan of fade outs . To me it always seems like the cheapest , most lazy and most simple way to make a jump in time and to end a sequence . I prefer a more creative solution , though in this particular case the fade outs are sort of suiting with the film its ' slow ' pace . The cinematography on the other hand was really superb . It gave the movie a totally professional look and feeling . I especially liked the lighting in some of the sequences . Anthony Head plays a real solid role in this film . Also his presence alone is already good enough to uplift the movie . The other main part is being played by Natasha Powell . She's obviously not too experienced but her performance feels very natural because of that , which is a real positive thing . I also really liked the ending of the movie , in which nothing has changed , despite of what happened all and everything is just the same as it was before , as if nothing had ever happened . It's a real good and interesting ending of the movie that is also brought very well to the screen ; The movie ends basically just in the same way as it started out . No words are spoken but everyone know what the ending means . It makes it very effective but it however also at the same time feels quite abrupt . But I think this is more because of that the movie HAD to be below 10 minutes long . Or perhaps it's just because of it that I don't too often watch these short sort of films . The film is about as good as you could expect from a 10 minutes short . Good story development , professionally put together , with an overall good sense of realism .
485327	1416505	374526	8.0	Great piece of film making . Very stylish !	Don't expect a crappy little amateur film . " Batman : Dead End " puts some of the superhero movies made these days till shame . The style and atmosphere is even darker and more sinister then in the 2 Tim Burton Batman movies . You can say that " Batman : Dead End " is a more daring movie . The movie shows how the makers can handle several styles and it's the crew that really deserves credit . Everything works perfect especially the cinematography . But let's not forget the cast . Clark Bartram is actually a very convincing Batman ( Better then Val Kilmer and George Clooney anyway ) and Andrew Koenig is the perfect Joker his character is actually much more different then from the original movie in a good way . The character is more sinister and psychotic in a scary way instead of an entertaining . The characters are much more closer then the ones from the comic books . Sure the story is just beyond silly but that's not the point , the crew really showed how they can handle different moments and styles . This little film is filled with wonderful little moments and is a shear pleasure to watch . Awesome fights , great make-up , wonderful costumes , excellent directing , great cast , most excellent cinematography and a great and daring atmosphere and style , what is there not to like ?
484686	1416505	51790	8.0	Way too old fashioned but still better than the first , due to its more dark story .	The movie " Ivan Groznyy I " from 1944 was already made in a terribly outdated style , even for its era . " Ivan Groznyy II : Boyarsky zagovor " is no different . Sergei M . Eisenstein's style of featuring long stares and extreme close-ups worked out extremely well and effective for his silent movies but in ' talkies ' it only slows the movie down . Sure it's fine and artistically impressive looking all but it's not halve as effective as would be the case with a silent movie . Even though this movie got released 14 years after the previous movie " Ivan Groznyy I " , it still got shot at the same time as the first movie . Reason why it got released so much later was because Stalin banned it because he wasn't too happy about the portrayal of Czar Ivan IV in this movie , who's more dark side is shown and besides shows a more crazy side of him , as he slowly slides into madness . Guess we should be lucky that this movie still exists today and that it didn't got completely destroyed during Stalin's reign . Because of the fact that the movie its story and main character are much darker , the movie becomes also more interesting to watch , when comparing it to the first movie . It's darker approach also makes its old fashioned style of film-making more tolerable . It suits its story better , even though its still far from ideal . I just can't imaging people still liked watching this in 1958 , no matter how great and big Eisenstein was , who had died 10 years prior to the release of this movie . It's an interesting watch for those interested in history and for the fans of Eisenstein's work . It would had been interesting to see part III being completed but Stalin halted production and showed destroyed most of the already shot footage , since the movie once more didn't showed Ivan to his own liking and the movie was supposedly also a protest against Stalin own current regime , that showed some parallels to the tyrant methods of Ivan the terrible , as got portrayed in that movie . Already an outdated movie during the time of its production but still an artistically interesting movie to watch , that works out better than the first movie .
485510	1416505	290334	9.0	By the powers , they actually got it right this time !	" X-Men " was a bit of a disappointment to me . Don't get me wrong it was entertaining and fun but it didn't had the right comic book / cartoon feeling to me . " X2 " is an huge improvement and it really surprised me how good this movie was ! One of the surprises of the year ! Advantage of " X2 " is that it doesn't have to waste time on character introduction because it begins were " X-Men " had ended . As a result the action starts right away ! And what an action this movie has , the opening attack of Nightcrawler is truly spectacular and an achievement in movie making . The movie has many , many more spectacular fights of which you never get bored and that are all done wonderfully . But not only the action has improved . Also the character have improved in a major way . Storm and Jean Grey have finally become much more interesting and had a bigger role to play , especially Jean Grey plays an important part this time . Also the story has improved a lot . It is a much more interesting story compared to the first movie and it actually has the same feeling as the comics / cartoons , something the first movie was also lacking . I also like how they " teamed up " Magneto and Mystique with the x-men this time . Another thing that had improved was the music . I'm sorry to say but Michael Kamen's score for " X-Men " was simply not good and didn't fitted the movie . John Ottman's " X2 " score suits the movie much better and even gives it a more " superhero " feeling . So all in all there are only improvements and there isn't much negative to say . Great action , great characters , great story , great movie ! Bring on part 3 . . . and 4 and 5 and . . . See it , even if you didn't liked the first one very much , this movie is an huge improvement .
484894	1416505	56347	9.0	Fantastic !	This version of " The Phantom of the Opera " is very different from the original and others . But fantastic nevertheless . The movie is approached differently compared to other versions , not only the story is different but also the characters . Especially The Phantom has become a bit of a different person . Personally I like this approach , it's up to you which approach you personally like the best . The typical Terence Fisher directing is very notable and he gives the movie a typical atmosphere . This movie is definitely one of Fisher's and the Hammer studio's best , even though the movie is now days a bit outdated of course . A surprising thing was the amount of humor used in this movie . It fitted the movie surprisingly well and worked out just great . The most fantastic thing is the cast . Herbert Lom plays as The Phantom a more of a tragic villain . Michael Gough as Lord Ambrose d'Arcy plays the real main villain of the movie and he is simply brilliant in his role ! He really steals the show in this one . The rest of the cast also pulls of quite well . Alas there are some flaws and the movie is simply too much outdated to can be considered a masterpiece . But the movie serves its purpose and looks visually great with excellent performances from the cast and a nice finale .
483888	1416505	112691	9.0	Close to perfect .	Even though the story is probably less impressive - and overdone when compared to the other Wallace & Gromit shorts , it still probably is my favorite . It's simply such a fine and entertaining movie to watch , not in the least because it has Preston , the evil villain dog in it and a whole bunch of sheep . It's an impressive looking movie , with some surprising big sequences . What I always love about the Wallace & Gromit movies is that they often feature some amazing build-up and shot action sequences and chases in particular . It's often worth the price alone already . This was the second Wallace & Gromit short to win an Oscar for best animated short , which not only proofs the quality and entertainment level of the Wallace & Gromit shorts but shows as well that you don't need a big budget or impressive new techniques to make a brilliant animated movie with . The claymation is impressive as always and has lots of details to it . It must be an incredibly time consuming but also incredibly rewarding process to make a movie like this . Nick Park must surely enjoy it . He's in the claymation business for over 20 years now , together with Peter Lord . This movie takes some chance to add another human character to the movie . All of the previous Wallace & Gromit movies were mostly purely about the strange friendship between the man and dog , in which the dog always seemed like the more clever and rational of the two . This gamble however worked out fine for the movie and the added love-story plot actually adds a lot to the movie . As a matter of fact , after this movie Wallace had many more love-interests in later Wallace & Gromit adventures , such as the big theatrical released " Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit " and the latest short " Wallace and Gromit in ' A Matter of Loaf and Death ' " . It of course are not just the human characters that make this movie but also really the animals . Preston the dog is such a great and evil movie villain . The sheep in this movie also provide the movie with lots of hilarious moments and they are cute looking as well . perhaps my favorite Wallace & Gromit short .
484967	1416505	52811	9.0	Surprisingly brilliant .	What a nice surprise this movie was . Director John Gilling surely knows how to make a well build up thriller with a slow pace but never a dull moment . The movie is extremely well written and has some at times incredibly good dialog . The fact that this movie is based on the true story of Burke and Hare - , two murderers who sold their victims to professor Knox , who uses them for his research , makes the movie even more interesting to watch . This movie is not really an horror movie , I would prefer to describe it as a dark-thriller . The movie doesn't have any scares but it has some well build up tension and a great thriller-story . I think it is more because of the fact that Cushing and Pleasance are in this , that people consider this a horror movie . But please , when watching this movie , don't expect a movie with walking death people or Cushing in a role of a ' Frankenstein ' like professor . The movie is shot in atmospheric black & white . It was wonderful to see both Cushing and Pleasance in black & white for a change . My only complaint about the style is that it is a bit too dark at times , which makes the movie sometimes hard to follow . Peter Cushing is most certainly good in his role as Dr . Robert Knox but it really is Donald Pleasence who uplifts the movie with his performance . This might very well be the best performance of him I have ever seen in a movie . He plays a slimy-tramp who is the lead-murderer of the movie . His character is portrayed so powerful and believable without ever going over-the-top . It really is the way the movie is build up and the wonderful directing by John Gilling that makes this movie an absolutely great thriller that deserves to be better known .
484499	1416505	86984	9.0	De Palma's homage to Hitchcock .	This movie is often misunderstood as an Hitckcock rip-off , I see it merely as an homage . It is a well known fact that De Palma admires Hitchcock . In this movie De Palma mixes several elements from various Hitchcock movies with as a result his homage to the master of suspense ; " Body Double " . Like I said before , the movie has several story elements from Hitchcock movies in it , mostly from " Vertigo " and " Rear Window " . The movie doesn't create a Hitchcock like feeling but it does know to create some Hitchcock tension . There are some really nerve wrecking scene's . The main reason that this movie doesn't have an Hitchcock like feeling is because of the fact that De Palma's style is too notably present for that . As a De Palma fan I don't mind this at all . There are some purely genius scene's that are typically De Palma like , such as the warehouse sequence . But the movie is not perfect . Even though I'm a fan of De Palma and his style , the movie still has some odd moments and scene's and the ending doesn't quite pay off . Still the tense moments make up a lot for this . I even think I can say that I found this one of the most tense movies I have seen . Suspenseful thriller , best to watch if you like De Palma and / or Hitchcock .
484451	1416505	20530	9.0	Imaging the videotape from " The Ring " , only set in the ' 20's and 15 minutes long .	This is a rather odd , surreal movie , that is told like a dream-like sequence . It's an amazingly imaginative movie . It's a very graphic movie that features bugs , carcasses , severed limbs , sexuality and whatever more . Some returning elements also in later Luis Buñuel movies . No , it of course doesn't always makes sense , but what dream has ever fully made sense to you ? Of course a lot of elements in the movie are supposed to be symbolic and have a deeper meaning . I guess the more you'll watch this movie , the more you'll understand its purpose and the thing the creators tried to tell with it . Because you're not always sure what you're watching the movie has an eerie and unpleasant atmosphere , which is the reason why it's really comparable , as is it's graphic style , to the dangerous videotape from " The Ring " and the original " Ringu " of course . I really liked the editing of the movie , that gave the movie lots of pace and helped to tell the story of the movie , with the help of some well placed and effective cuts . The camera-work is innovative and uses some great compositions , that were still quite unusual and new for its time . Seeing this movie is a weird and unusual experience , but it's really one worth undertaking . Even if you don't get the movie its meaning it's worth it , thanks to amazing creativity and its visual quality .
485546	1416505	63522	9.0	Psychological horror can't get much better than this .	Even though no monsters or real scare moments are present , the atmosphere and the psychological elements of this movies still makes this a strong and original horror movie . Just like the 1973 movie " Don't Look Now " , the horror is hidden in the creepy story that keeps you guessing till the end what is truly going on and who you are to believe . The movie is told in a good slow pace which makes the movie and the characters more realistic . Also the atmosphere is another element that adds to the realistic feeling of the movie . Thing I wasn't really to happy about was the editing . At times the movie jumps just from one scene to another without any ' warning ' . For instance , the main characters are talking in the living room and boom , the next moment they are sitting at the dinner-table . I'm almost positive that this was done on purpose and that it was perhaps merely an experiment but it was not something I was happy about . So experiment failed in my opinion . Really my favorite moments were the dream sequences . There were just like real dreams are ; weird and not logical . Quite possible the most realistic dream sequences featured in a movie-history . Real kudos to Roman Polanski for the magnificent directing of this movie . The actors portray their characters very realistic and are helped by the solid script and dialog . I love how they made Rosemary the only real true main character of the movie . There are not a lot of movies that focus so much on mainly the female character as this movie . Yes , of course there are enough movies where a female is the main characters but most of those movies also feature a much present male character , or other characters . This movie focuses mainly on just Rosemary , especially towards the ending when her paranoia and fear grows and she begins to feel more and more alone and helpless . An highly original and unforgettable horror movie that is up there with the best movies of the ' 60's .
484338	1416505	139654	9.0	What a delightful surprise !	Denzel Washington's Oscar winning performance made me want to see this movie , or otherwise I would have never ever watched this movie because normally I don't watch " ghetto , gangster , set in present day , with rappers in it , movies " like this . But the movie turned out to be way better than expected and it's arguably one of the best movie of 2001 . The movie has an amazing pace that covers one of the days in the life of rookie narcotic officer Hoyt ( Ethan Hawke ) and rouge LAPD veteran Harris ( Denzel Washington ) on their first ( and only ? ) day together on the job . The movie gets nowhere boring or slow and has tons of surprising plot twist that make the story very interesting and even tense multiple times throughout the movie . The power of the movie is in Denzel Washington's Oscar worthy performance and the chemistry between the two main characters . Denzel Washington is perfect as " bad guy " and delivers his lines in a most amazing way . His lines sometimes seem to come straight out of a Quentin Tarantino movie . Also notable is Scott Glenn in his role as a rotten old drugs lord . The atmosphere and style of the movie feels very realistic mainly thanks to the cinematography , nice fast editing , script and the performance's by the cast . Way better than you would expect it to be , give it a chance !
484346	1416505	254455	9.0	Brilliantly made and constructed movie .	This is really one of the better constructed movies I've seen in a while . Both the storytelling and style of the movie can be called unique . It starts mixing reality with fiction and its hard to tell what really happened and what didn't . It features lots of ' what-if ' themes and the story is being rewritten in the characters mind , also with lots of symbolism , mainly with the moon and the water . It doesn't make this the most accessible movie but then again , you don't ever have to watch an European movie for its accessibility . Things start off quite slow but as the story develops the story gets more and more complicated and non-linear , when the line between fiction and reality gets blurred more and more . It does make the movie hard to follow at times but it at the same time makes the movie more interesting to watch and enables everybody start to define things on their own . You of course have to be open to these sort of movies though . Also the very explicit nudity isn't just for everybody . Sex plays a key part in the movie . It helps to tell the story and plays a significant role in the story lines and help to indicate when things are truth or fiction . Never before has sex played such a key part in the storytelling of a movie . This movie is always presented as a Paz Vega but this movie it's main character is in my opinion played by Tristán Ulloa . He's the writer , were the entire movie involves around . The story is mostly set inside his head . The three main actors ( Paz Vega , Tristán Ulloa , Najwa Nimri ) of the movie are really good and carry the entire movie . Visually the movie is really great and impresses just as much as the storytelling of the movie . The camera-work and colors are really great and create a very unique atmosphere for the movie . It helps to make " Lucía y el sexo " an even bigger and more enjoyable movie to watch , visually . Those who are open for an unique , one of a kind , unusual movie experience , will surely be delighted with this magnificent beautiful looking and constructed movie .
484039	1416505	23814	9.0	Dangerous love .	This feels like a real modern movie even though it's a movie that got made in the old days and features a story that is set in a very specific time period , the story doesn't feel old because it isn't a formulaic movie that features the usual story . Just basically imaging a love-story version of " The Last Samurai " , in which an American woman falls into the hands of a ' villainoush ' Chinese general during the Chinese Cival War . They begin to grow more toward each other because they begin to understand each other and each others cultures and prejudices toward each other are being taken away . The movie also doesn't begin like a love-story but it just slowly turns into one . It also is a reason why the movie does not feel forced with its story or typical romantic movie elements , making this movie an original one to watch . It's perhaps even a movie that was ahead of its time , also with its theme of interracial relationships . Not sure if it completely was the movie its intentions to bring something totally new and shocking , since while watching this movie I simply more had the feeling that the movie just tried to bring a love-story to the screen that was just a bit more different and original than others . As a matter of fact its theme of interracial love already got handled in much older films so it's not like this movie is the first to handle it but nevertheless the movie feels like a breath of fresh air , when being compared to the usual love-story from the ' 30's . It seems like an odd thing that a Swedish , born in Denmark , actor portrays a Chinese actor but the make-up effects are convincing looking and the fact that Nils Asther is Swedish makes sure that the character has a typical distinctive accent that sounds also like a real Chinese person that is speaking in English . As a matter of fact it was his accent that later ruined Asther's career , who was a big star before during the silent-era . There of course weren't that many Asian actors around yet in Hollywood at the time and it wasn't really uncommon for movies to cast Caucasians in Asian or black roles . Or perhaps simply because they didn't wanted to work with a real Chinese person because they regarded him as a lesser and less capable person of getting the job done . you also have to remember that this movie got made in 1933 , when people's view of the world wasn't as broad . But no the movie is not totally perfect . The movie still suffers from the typical problems most ' 30's movies suffer from . The emotions just don't always feel right . For instance it never really becomes obvious in the movie how desperate Megan Davis is about getting home , back to her fiancée , simply because this emotion doesn't become sensible in the movie . Also the real reason for the two main characters to get drawn toward each other and feel in love doesn't really get explained in the movie . But well , love just can't always be explained , though it seemed to me at times that the love-story within this movie was more a case of ' the Stockholm syndrome ' , for which the hostage gets compassion for her abductor and even fall for him . But than at the other hand the the emotions and love in the movie feel real and also truly sensible . A movie that goes both ways with its emotions but it still deserves the benefit of the doubt simply because its such a well made and acted one with a great ' modern ' story . It's a Frank Capra movie from the earlier day of his careers but it's fair to say that this movie is also one of his very best and also one of his finest directed movies , with some great memorable and greatly done sequences . It's a well told movie that doesn't feel like a normal standard made romantic movie , despite its romantic overtone with its story . It's really a movie with more layers , about different cultures , respect , betrayal , honor , trust and what war can do to people , for " The Bitter Tea of General Yen " is also still a bit of a war movie . This movie has so many elements and themes in that all get handled really well and are balanced well throughout the entire movie . It's a movie that is set during the Chinese Civil war , that is a sort of forgotten time period already , or at least in the western world it is . The movie features a surprising amount of war sequences still and also some surprising action . Besides the surprisingly fine acting Nils Asther , the movie also features Barbara Stanwyck , who gives a real great and effective performance . The movie is mostly about the two of them , just like a romantic story should be of course . Nevertheless it also features some interesting different characters , also played by some fine actors , that give the movie and its story often some more spice and depth . A great ' modern ' old love story .
484494	1416505	50539	9.0	A special effects feast .	Along with " Jason and the Argonauts " ( 1963 ) this was one of the movies that had the biggest influence on the evolution of special effects . " The Incredible Shrinking Man " for me is a movie in which the story for me plays no importance at all . I just watch this movie to enjoy the early and many special effects . Sure , most of them now days look almost ridiculous and outdated but I can appreciate and enjoy them . It's wonderful to watch the special effects as they are one of the earliest in movie history and set the trend for many future movies to come . But honestly , I also have to give credit for the story . From a movie like this you would expect that it heavily leans on the special effects alone but the creators actually spend lots of effort on the story and manages to put some extra layers , emotions and deeper meanings in it . There are some truly classical scene's which involves the main character Scott Carey ( played by Grant Williams ) fighting against a cat and the final fight against a spider . It's a kind of like an early Shelob versus Sam fight from " The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King " and it's very similar in many ways . The mother of future science fiction movies , a must see .
485115	1416505	386470	10.0	Believe it or not , it's one of my favorite movies .	How good can a Star Wars fan film get ? Want to know the answer ? Then go and watch " The Formula " ! Problem with many Star Wars fan films is that many of them are the same and are basically a lame excuse to do a lightsaber duel , which are mostly set in a forest . " The Formula " perfectly spoofs this but without making the fan filmers ridiculous . It's kind of the same as Tim Burton's " Ed Wood " and it's more of a homage to all the fan filmers . In a way it also makes me proud of being a Star Wars fan . The movie has a great story . What makes the story so great are probably the characters that are in it and some good dialogue . Many of the situations will be very recognizable for those who have ever made or did an attempt of making a Star Wars fan film . The humor plays a crucial element in the movie and gives it a very good fun kind of feeling . There are some clever jokes and the movie spoofs more than just the Star Wars movies . My favorite element of the movie are the two stereotype Trekkies that are in it , those two are absolutely hilarious and have some great dialogue and show that Star Wars fans are not so nerdy after all , when you compare to them ( no offense Trekkie ; - ) ) . Sure the movie is not completely flawless . Lets face it , it is and stays an amateur movie . But it's made with much profession , love and passion that'll forget you're watching a low / no-budget amateur movie . But that still doesn't mean that it is always perfect . For instance of course the acting is at times simply weak and not all of the jokes are successful . But in no way all of that weakens the excellence of this movie . Wonderful film with tons of fun ! Especially recommendable for those who are a bit familiar in the Star Wars fan film community .
484471	1416505	91149	10.0	A forgotten Disney masterpiece .	This is probably one of the most unknown Disney classic . For the time the movie was quite new and revolutionary and it doesn't quite fit in with the other movies Disney made in that period . , perhaps that's the reason why it has been forgotten . But " The Great Mouse Detective " deserves to be known and seen . The characters are real classics and one of the best to have ever appeared in a Disney movie . Actually Professor Ratigan ( voiced by the legendary Vincent Price ) is quite possibly my favorite movie villain of all time . No wonder that it was Vincent Price's favorite role . His style and humor is priceless and it cracks me up every time . But the other characters are also very memorable . I especially like the character of doctor Dawson . The story is good and very pleasant and very mature compared to other Disney's from that period . But of course the idea of making a story about the mouse version of Sherlock Holmes alone is already good enough to make a fun movie about . One of the other things that makes this movie different compared to other Disney's from that period are the songs or better said the lack of it . The movie features only one song ( 3 if you count the bar song and the goodbye , so soon song . ) . But it's not a miss . The surprising magnificent musical score by famous composer Henry Mancini make up for this loss . The movie has a very spectacular final on and in the famous Big Ben . It's by far my favorite Disney movie ending . Certainly a fun movie to watch over and over again . P . S . : If you're Dutch speaking , I highly recommend that you watch this movie Dutch spoken . Believe it or not it's even better and more fun then the English version ! Believe me , just give it a shot .
485478	1416505	65207	10.0	Fantastic stuff !	This is one of the first real action movies as we know it today , ever made . The movie has lots of explosions and gun - and fist fights . The story is told in a fast pace with lots of cuts , even though the movie itself isn't short at all ( 158 minutes . ) . Even though it is still a war movie , this movie isn't as heavy and or serious as many other WW II movies made in the same period . It is kind of in the same style as " The Guns of Navarone " ( Also written by Alistair MacLean . ) . It's more is adventurous and fun to watch than heavy or realistic . Director Brian G . Hutton later also made the other ' fun ' / adventurous / WW II movie " Kelly's Heroes " . Another element that distinct this movie from other movies from the same genre is the story . The story by famous writer Alistair MacLean is just brilliant ! It begins as an average WW II rescue-mission movie but as the movie progresses the story takes several twists , until at a certain point you don't even know who to thrust anymore . The ending is really action-movie-like spectacular and features a tense fight an a moving cable-car followed by the perhaps even better car chase , which really reminded of the chase were Indy and his father are escaping the Nazi's on the motorcycle , in " Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade " Even the music sounded kind of similar ! I wouldn't be surprised if Spielberg and Williams were inspired by this movie . The same goes for many other movie directors and other persons in the movie business by the way . I see similarities between this movie with ' modern ' work quite often , both in story and characters as well as the action , editing and many other elements from this movie . This really is an inspirational movie , that as an action movie , just like as for instance " North by Northwest " , was far ahead of its time . It was a bit strange to see Clint Eastwood in the sidekick role . The main character of the movie is played by the legendary Richard Burton . Both actors really push this movie to an higher level with their profession and expertise and both are very believable in their roles . An entertaining , action packed adventurous war movie with a splendid story and two wonderful performances from the two main actors .
484785	1416505	26138	10.0	Horror with depth .	This movie is absolutely beautiful ! The story is highly original ( especially considering that this is a sequel ) and extremely well executed . I'm not sure if its fair to call it better than its predecessor " Frankenstein " , since the both are hard to compare in my opinion . They are different of each other in quite some ways but both of them are brilliant in their own way . Karloff most definitely seems more at ease in his role this time and he's not overacting anymore . He plays the monster with some real passion and eye for detail . His make-up also looks better than ever . Still I think it's a bit of a shame that so many actors from the original " Frankenstein " didn't reprise their role in this movie . Lot's of the characters are played by different actors this time . But I'm surely glad that Colin Clive returned as Dr . Henry Frankenstein . I already really loved him in " Frankenstein " and I enjoyed him once more in this movie . An underrated actor that died too young . The emotions are once more very real and extremely powerful . The scene were the monster makes friendship with the blind man is unforgettable and truly a powerful sequence . The movie is really more than just a mere horror movie , it's a powerful cinematic masterpiece with some real depth . A beautiful and powerful movie .
484585	1416505	43456	10.0	It still is one of the best alien ' invasion ' movies ever made .	This movie is so totally refreshing different than its fellow genre movies from the ' 50's ! Everyone has a certain images in their mind about ' 50's science-fiction movies , with flying saucers of which you can see the wires , aliens with bad make-up effects and simple plots . The type of Ed Wood movies . " The Day the Earth Stood Still " is a much , much different movie fortunately ! It's not a movie that tries to impress , it's instead more of a movie that tries to provoke and at all time remain as realistic as possible . The movie its message is clear and ( unfortunately ) it still applies today , just as much as it did over 50 years ago . Normally these type of movies from this time period would be about aliens causing mayhem and destruction , by trying to take over or simply destroy the Earth . This movie does begin as one of those sort of movies but soon starts to take a positive turn , when it starts to totally focus on its script and story , rather than any action or over-the-top science-fiction moments . It's a clever and provoking movie . Everything happening in this movie happens with a reason . The way the alien visits Earth and tries to discover things and places is done in a great way . It's a reflecting and objective view of a neutral person . It's really a movie that holds up a mirror to the world and therefor works great and effective as a social commentary , that still applies today . The movie has some great convincing special effects ( especially for ' 50's standards of course ) that are still acceptable by today standards . The movie is not as cheap looking as most of the genre movies from the same time period , though I imaging this movie had just such an high budget as any other . So also real big kudos to director Robert Wise who brought it all so very well and convincing to the screen . Robert Wise would later make also such science-fiction classics as " The Andromeda Strain " and " Star Trek : The Motion Picture " . Another thing that makes this movie distinct itself from other is the classic Bernard Herrmann score . The main character is greatly played by the unknown Michael Rennie . He really has the right looks of an alien in human form . Also surprising how important and strong the female character played by Patricia Neal in this movie is . The always great Sam Jaffe also plays a good , though small role in the movie . But the real classic and most memorable character of the movie is the robot Gort , played by the very tall Lock Martin . Even though it's not a character that talks or even movies a lot , it's still one that impresses very much , just by its looks and actions . He has become a real classic ! A real refreshing genre classic about still ' hot ' subjects !
484006	1416505	53125	10.0	Spectacular !	Just like " Citizen Kane " , it's not exactly THE best movie ever made but still a very revolutionary and important one and above all , a real classic ! I think that " North by Northwest " can be compared to an early James Bond movie and can be regarded as one of the most early ' modern ' action movie . Some sequences are really spectacular and are shot and edited in the same way as most action movies are these days . Of course the crop duster sequence is a classic but I like the spectacular finale on Mt . Rushmore even better . The music by Bernard Hermann , is just as Hitchcock's directing ahead of its time . There also is some lovely cinematography by yet again Robert Burks . The story is really exciting and it has all the elements that makes a movie a spectacular adventure to watch . Is there anything wrong with this movie ? In my opinion not . The movie certainly isn't the most exciting or thrilling Hitchcock movie but it might very well be the most entertaining one also thanks to some well scripted humor . Also look out for a young Martin Landau as the henchman Leonard .
484915	1416505	133093	10.0	The most influential and refreshing science-fiction movie since " Star Wars " .	" The Matrix " has redefined the science-fiction genre . Previous to this movie , most science-fiction movies consisted out of scene's in space with spacecrafts , aliens , all set in a futuristic world . Most movies that tried to be different from this , mostly failed . " The Matrix " does however does not fail and it redefined the science-fiction genre and has taken it to a whole different and more seriously taken level of movie-making . The movie has inspired many different movies ever since and showed that science-fiction and action elements are a great and spectacular combination . From that perspective " The Matrix " is one of the most important movies for film-making , from the ' 90's . This is a superb piece of movie-making . The Wachowski ' brothers ' were obviously inspired by the Japanese anime style and they transform that style spectacularly into a life-action movie . Because of the style and flair of the movie , it makes the action look spectacular and even also look as something totally new . The fantastic bullet-time effects were something unseen before and are already alone reason enough why this movie is already almost a classic and certainly unforgettable movie . The style and new effects used in the movie make this movie to be also a refreshing one . It's an extremely original movie , both story-wise and technique-wise . Especially the action is what truly makes this movie a success . The fight and action sequences are beautifully choreographed . It also all is beautifully shot by cinematographer Bill Pope , who uses some fantastic lighting and camera-angles at times . The musical score from Don Davis is also quite good . Also the costumes and settings most certainly do not disappoint . The special effects are spectacular and also something totally new at times . The cast is not the strongest element of the movie . Keanu Reeves is fairly good as the main character but he lacks some charisma at times . Some goes for Carrie-Anne Moss to be honest . Actors who do not disappoint are Laurence Fishburne , Joe Pantoliano and the fantastic Hugo Weaving in his real big breakthrough role . He is an excellent ' villain ' because of his look and way of acting . But what really makes and shapes the movie is its story . Yes , it's complex and believe , not everything makes sense or is explained in a satisfying way but it at least is something totally original and imaginative . The story really shapes the movie and its style and make the action and science-fiction elements of the movie work fantastically together . The movie is great non-stop spectacular action entertaining that doesn't even get slow or boring even when nothing is really happening . This is mainly due to the imaginative powerful story of the movie . If you don't understand and / or get the story the first time , just watch it a second or third time . The movie is worth it . The movie uses multiple layers , symbolism and elements from religions and other styles of movie-making . It makes you discover more new things , every time you watch the movie . One of the most original and influential movies from the ' 90's and therefor also an absolute must-see !
484937	1416505	117631	10.0	One of the great biopics .	" Shine " is one of the great movies of the ' 90's , that became an unexpected success in 1996 and was the movie that earned Geoffrey Rush his as of yet only Oscar win and got the movie 6 more Oscar nominations , including best director and best picture . The movie shows how Australian born David Helfgott gets formed and influenced in his early life by his demanding and abusive father ( wonderfuly played by Armin Mueller-Stahl ) , who is in strict control of the family . He asks a lot from the already very unstable David and influences ever step in his life , probably also to make up for his own shortcomings in life . He's an unpredictable character with two faces and you can really feel the fear he puts in the family and David in particular . Things go worse and worse mentally for David as he grows up and eventually goes to study in England at the Royal College of Music . He has a breakdown which for once and for all definitely labels him as a psychotic man . His personality could definitely been described as crazy . He gets perfectly and beautifully portrayed by Geoffrey Rush , who truly deserved the Oscar he received for his role . But in fact he is only in the movie for perhaps halve the running time . For " Shine " uses lots of flashbacks about Helfgott's early life and as a young adult , when he is being played by different actors . One of those actors is the know very well known Noah Taylor , who also plays the part fine . Also really impressive is Armin Mueller-Stahl . He doesn't usually have very big parts in English spoken movies but in this movie he plays one of his bigger and more interesting roles . It's a true memorable performance from him and he also truly deserved his Oscar nomination for this movie . I keep thinking it's a great shame he got discovered so late by the big-money movie industry , since he is already close to 80 by now , which should mean that his biggest and greatest roles should already be behind him by now . But who knows , some actors just go on forever , till a very old age . Take for instance John Gielgud , who also stars in this movie . At the time he was already well over 90 years old and he would continue to play on in many more great and big productions , till his death in 2000 . Some actors are just truly born as actors . It simply is in their blood and they can't stop playing . Moments in Helfgott's life are never portrayed too long but also never too short . This means that the story always comes right to the point and doesn't dance around it . The movie becomes very effective because of this and on top of that gets presented with a good steady pace . It's a reason why this movie is really one of the better autobiographic movies ever made . It's a really great directed and told movie , from Scott Hicks . But of course like every good biopic , the movie doesn't only presents facts and some things are altered , in order to enhance the movie and its story or characters . For instance right after this movie the real Helfgott became a true full God , while in all honesty David Helfgott is a great piano player but just not the genius one as portrayed in this movie . It's kind of like the piano man . The mysterious mute man who was found in Kent England in 2005 . It was said he was a brilliant piano player , while in fact he just simply knew how to play a piano well but was by no means a great or professional player . Just like David Helfgott , it are just the unusual circumstances and character personalities that makes people say they are geniuses , rather than it's an objective reflection of their actual qualities . But like I said , this isn't anything unusual to do for a biopic , to play around a little with the facts and it certainly is no objection when it actually enhances the movie . " Shine " truly benefits from its approach and story . I also enjoyed David Hirschfelder nice little musical score ( also Oscar-nominated ) . Of course the movie also benefits from it's classical compositions that are being featured . It's of course a very musical movie , since it's about the life of a musician but you really don't need a classic musical lover to enjoy or to appreciate this movie though . The movie ends quite abrupt and perhaps not satisfying enough but this is of course simply due to the fact that David Helfgot is still alive and active today . Who knows , perhaps they could had better waited for another 30 years to come up with a movie about his life , for who knows what more strange and beautiful moments his life shall know . Perhaps it's not the most stylish or greatest made movie but the combination of the interesting unique story , pace and main character ( and of course Geoffrey Rush his performance of him ) are what makes this movie such a basically flawless ( you simply just forgive the movie for its flaws and shortcomings while you're watching it ) and captivating one to watch .
485144	1416505	75148	10.0	Way more than just a sport movie .	This is easily the best sport movie ever made but the movie is way more than a boxing movie . It's also one of the best drama-movies I have ever seen . Reason why " Rocky " is a classic is of Sylvester Stallone . Believe it or not , he really deserved that Oscar nomination for best actor . Why ? Because he simply IS Rocky . He plays the character so well with so much passion that he can be regarded as one of the best and most memorable movie characters in movie history . The movie is filled with strong solid character , I especially love how the unusual friendship between Rocky and Paulie is portrayed . Talia Shire is also very impressive as shy young woman . The love-story between her and Rocky is done very well and in a believable way . The movie its main focus is on the drama and only the last 30 minutes of the movie really focuses on the boxing . So really , you don't have to be a boxing fan to like this movie , this movie should be enjoyable and unforgettable for everybody . The story is told in a good slow pace and it pays attention to the character's emotions and struggles . The story of ' underdog ' has been much copied ever since in many movies and in many different variations but nothing has ever came close to " Rocky " ' s level . The music by Bill Conti is also of course unforgettable and is also something that brings the movie to the next level . Even though the movie is mainly a drama , the best scene's are still the boxing sequence's . They are filmed very well and are very spectacular to watch time after time . You'll simply never get tired of those scene's ! In my opinion a real classic !
485107	1416505	209144	10.0	Original movie-making at its very best .	Every now and then , an original concepts gets turned into an highly original movie . " Memento " is a fine example of original movie-making at its very best . It's impossible to fully describe what this movie is about . Best thing is to watch this movie with a clear head in order to follow the movie . But even then some parts of the movie remain confusing . Because of this " Memento " is a perfect movie to watch multiple times , every time you will discover a new fact or things like that . The story is told beautifully and highly original with flashbacks and jumps in time . Basically the whole same story is told over and over again but every time you get to know a little bit of more information . Sounds confusing doesn't it ? Well , don't say I didn't warned you . . . Christopher Nolan provides this movie with a brilliantly suiting visual style and directs the movie with lots of flair and pace . Truly a good young director of which we will hear way more in the near future . He also already made real fame by the ' casual ' movie viewer by directing the stylish blockbuster hit " Batman Begins " . Not only is he a great director , he also is a great writer . The acting in the movie is really solid . Guy Pearce is a great leading man and he is supported by some wonderful actors in the supporting cast : Carrie-Anne Moss , Joe Pantoliano . Because that the movie and its story are so original you never know what is going to happen next . It's a typical independent movie , without any clichés or other distracting elements . Yet the movie is more accessible then it sounds . Every person should be able to appreciate this movie and be absolutely captivated by it . An unique movie experience that is highly recommendable to everyone !
484260	1416505	67023	10.0	One of the most tense movies I've ever seen .	Yes , the talent is really showing ! Along with " The Sugarland Express " this is the movie that can be held responsible for Spielberg's breakthrough . How often does it happen that a TV movie gets a thearetical release ? Not often I think , a movie has to be really good and special for that and " Duel " truly is a rare movie like that . What it is that the movie makes so tense is hard to describe . It probably is the lack of explanation . It is never explained who the truck driver is and what his motivation was . Also the tension is build up perfectly and the movie is just one big chase that will keep you in the edge of your seat . The cinematography is simple but yet effective . It fits the movie's story perfectly and helps to add to the tension . It has to be said ; Dennis Weaver does a great job . Although his voice over at times throughout the movie doesn't feel nessecary and distracting from some of the scene's , such as the whole bar scene , I have a feeling that the scene would had been more effective if it would have left the images and Dennis Weaver's expressions speak for itself . A real tense movie , with an ending that doesn't disappoint .
485370	1416505	24852	10.0	Way more than just another Laurel & Hardy movie .	I expected just another Laurel & Hardy slapstick comedy but instead got something that surpassed all my expectations . The story is absolutely great ( based on the Glen MacDonough operetta ) and features many well known fairy tale characters . The entire movie is set in a cheerful and colorful ( atleast when you watch the colored-in version of the movie , released in the ' 90's of course . ) world where everyone lives their simple and happy life and spend most of the time singing cheerful sappy songs . It's truly a movie that's both over-the-top and terribly outdated but that now has become a part of its charm and makes this movie a totally great and absolutely irresistible one . All of the fairly tale like characters are absolutely great in the movie . Most of them don't really play a significant role but their presence alone is enough reason to give the movie a joyful feeling . Speaking of insignificant roles ; how about the boys ? Well , to be honest Laurel & Hardy don't really play a most significant role in the movie . They are mealy sidekicks in the story and even though they get to do some funny sequences , with some typical Laurel & Hardy humor , this movie is not really a slapstick or comedy . It's more a cheerful musical with some comical characters in it . It's difficult to see if the presence of Laurel & Hardy make this movie a better one or not . It isn't really a Laurel & Hardy movie and it has a totally different feel and atmosphere . Some of the fans will be delighted with their appearance in this movie , while others will perhaps be disappointed by it . What really drives the movie is the story and its characters . The movie has a very solid villain in it , perfectly portrayed by Henry Brandon . Brandon apparently only was in his 20's when he played the role , so also lots of credits have to go to the make-up and costume department , for making him look like a scary , old , ugly , almost Scrooge like villain . The story also really has some solid moments in it . The ending is surprisingly big and spectacular and features monster like creatures , versus an army of wooden soldiers ( in certain sequences created with some early stop-motion effects ) , build by our two boys . Even though the movie is mostly cheerful , it also knows how to build up its tension , with as a result some really well story-wise constructed moments that all work out extremely well . I'm going to say something very daring now but here goes ; In my opinion this movie is even better than " The Wizard of Oz " . Both movies are much alike in several different ways . Both movie are set in a cheerful imaginary world , with imaginary likable characters and a ruthless villain who spoils all the happiness in that same cheerful world . Let's face it , both of those movie are extremely old fashioned and outdated but the cheerful charm makes both of the movie irresistible ones , that still speak to the imagination . This movie is a real forgotten masterpiece and the movie deserves to be better known and seen by persons all over the world . Really a movie that I truly enjoyed watching .
484221	1416505	28201	10.0	The story of a cheat .	This is a rather interesting and originally told movie . It focuses on the life of a charming scoundrel . It doesn't sound that interesting or original but its originality also really is more in the way the movie is being told . It's shot with actual little dialog on it and instead features a witty voice-over ( by director / writer / main actor Sacha Guitry himself ) , who tells the story in an amusing way with a pleasant pace . The movie not just begins with an introduction of the main characters but also that of some of the crew members who were involved with this movie . This already sorts of sets the tone for the rest of the movie . It's a very original and unique little movie , that due to its style and atmosphere also definitely as an highly entertaining one to watch . I wouldn't exactly call the style surrealistic and absurdism is perhaps a better word to describe the movie its style and pleasant , often subtle , comedy . Its style always keeps the movie going and also makes this one of the faster paced movies from the ' 30's . It's also a reason why the movie is actually quite short , with its about 80 minutes of running time . Even though the movie basically covers the entire life span of a person , it's over before you know it . You'll surely have a good time watching this very pleasant and highly original little film .
484250	1416505	72684	10.0	One of the most beautiful movies ever made .	This is certainly one of the most beautiful movies ever made . Beautiful is of course something totally different than saying ' this is the best movie ever made ' . With beautiful I mean that the movie is superbly looking with flawless costumes and sets and impressive landscapes and camera-work . And please lets also not forget the beautiful and perfect use of classical music that was all rearranged by composer Leonard Rosenman , for which he also received an Oscar . Same goes for the flawless art-direction , cinematography and costume design . Truly all the Oscars that it at least deserved to get . " Barry Lyndon " is a long movie , like Kubrick movies often are . A lot is happening in the story but it never gets to much because the story is told in a slow way . Almost the entire life of the character Redmond Barry / Barry Lyndon is told in the movie . As a sort of Irish 18th century Forrest Gump he travels and sees Europe through the eyes of many different sides . It gives a great view and feel of the 18th century Europe and the British ' gentleman ' culture in particular . There is some absolutely stunning dialog in the movie . It's this typical old fashioned English polite way of talking that is used in this movie . It was a real joy to listen to and it provided some highly entertaining and memorable moments at times . The lines are all perfectly delivered by the fine actors . It was also great to see Pat Roach in this movie . Pat Roach is known for playing almost every of the big thugs in all the Indiana Jones movies . It's funny , I didn't recognized him by his face or voice but I did by his style of fighting . He fought in the same manner as he later did in " Raiders of the Lost Ark " during the airplane fight . The story is told slowly and beautifully and is all beautiful narrated by Michael Hordern . You'll never be bored while watching this movie , I can guarantee that . There is simply too much happening in this movie to allow that . An absolutely beautiful movie that also is an absolute must see .
485048	1416505	15064	10.0	Such a powerful striking movie !	This is such a great - and even better told story . It features normal average persons who get in some realistic difficulties and struggle with life . You can just feel how heartbroken the old man is after loosing his job and the respect he had among the community because of his uniform . Yeah , uniforms were still a that big thing at that time . The movie especially does a good job with showing the contrasts between the ' two worlds ' , of money and respectability and poor and being just considered average , or even less . It makes " Der Letzte Mann " such a powerful and effective movie ! I love it when a silent movie doesn't use too many or hardly any title cards . Just let the images tell the story . It takes a great director to do this but F . W . Murnau was obviously one of the best , not just of his time but of all time ! The movie is filled with some greatly made and looking memorable sequences , such as a couple of great dream-like - and surrealistic sequences . In those sequences it becomes once all the more obvious how great of a director F . W . Murnau was . The movie is filled and even more uplifted by its fantastic camera-work ! I love it when old movies use early movement-effects and pans and zooms , though obviously the movie doesn't use this all the time . Especially the beginning is memorable , when the movie opens with one of the first ever hand-held camera shots . It's different from the normal usual static camera-work from the ' 20's and ' 30's . But also the lighting of the movie is absolutely phenomenal . It gives the movie such a good , warm and effective powerful look . The same goes for the fast and nimble editing and compositions , that make the story flow extremely well . Old movies normally feel distant because of the old fashioned style and look . But not this one ! The movie was obviously mostly shot at studios and the street sets look like they were made out of cardboard ( which they most likely also were ) but that is all part of the charm of these expressionistic German movies from the ' 20's , such as also " Metropolis " , " Das Cabinet des Dr . Caligari " and " Faust " . The make-up effects are perhaps an underrated aspect of the movie . I mean it's not a ' make-up ' movie , such as " Nosferatu , eine Symphonie des Grauens " or " Faust " ( both also directed by F . W . Murnau by the way ) but remember that Emil Jannings was in his early 40's during this movie , though he truly looked like he was in his 60's or so . So some really effective and convincing make-up effects here ! If you didn't knew any better you would just think that this movie had a 60 year old playing the main character . A great , powerful - but also beautiful movie experience , from F . W . Murnau !
484932	1416505	266308	10.0	A brilliant and unique treat .	All you need for a great movie is a good and original concept . At least that is what this movie suggests . It's daring and unique concept makes this an original movie for sure but it handles its concept also with lots of class and depth , making this simply a brilliant Japanese movie from the late Kinji Fukasaku . Out of all Japanese movies I've seen so far , this is also the one that is the most Americanized . Normally this isn't a very good sign when a ' foreign ' movie gets made in Hollywood-style but this movie is truly an exception to this . The fact that this movie feels Hollywood like is also a reason why this movie is perfectly watchable and accessible , even for those who aren't at custom with movies from outside of the United States . But however this really doesn't mean that this movie is your average typical Hollywood work . Quite on the contrary . The movie has a quite daring concept , that perhaps also sounds silly and unlikely at first but in the movie gets delivered as a real realistic and effective one . The movie can be seen as a protest against modern ( Japanese ) society and perhaps also the media . It gives " Batoru rowaiaru " also some more depth with its story and themes . It's not just its concept that makes this a great and original movie but also truly the handling of it all . The main concept is very simple but at the same time very intriguing . It raises some real moral questions about what you would do when you get into a situation like this . The story is about an average Japanese ninth-grade school class who are being forced to kill each other on a remote island in a freaky death-match , in which the only survivor after 3 days gets to get back home . If more than 1 person is still alive after 3 days , everyone dies . This all due to the Battle Royale Act , that is called to life due to the highly increasing insubordination of the Japanese youth , that causes the Japanese economy to decrease rapidly . The movie has lots of different characters in it , of which some have less problems with killing their friends than others . Some play the game really fanatically , while others team up , in order to survive longer and also to try and find a way to end the game without having to kill their friends . Everyone plays their own game and no matter what their intentions and morals are , all are being forced to do something against their own nature , due to the very unusual circumstance they find themselves in . The diversity of characters also ensures that the movie never gets boring or ' more of the same ' all of the time . The movie has some real great characters in it that are big movie stereotypes but really work out well for this type of movie . It gives lots of different characters room but never without loosing focus on its two main characters . The fact that most youngsters are being played by real teenagers also helps . It increases the credibility and also makes it easier to identify with characters . Of course the movie is also filled with violence , done Japanese-style . The movie is pretty straight-forward with its violence , from pretty early on already into the movie . Again , this also really adds to the realism and overall credibility of the movie . For Japanese standards its also a pretty expensive and big looking movie with its action , even though the movie only cost a mere $4 , 500 , 000 to make . Due to its nature the movie never became a big success outside of Japan , since no distributors dared to buy the movie and release it in different countries . In Japan the movie remains one of the most successful box office successes and the movie has also really founds its way outside of the Japanese boundaries and the movie now days is known in most countries and considered to be a cult-classic already . One of the most daring and original movies I've seen in a while .
